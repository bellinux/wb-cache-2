40|$|Magnetothermal free {{convection}} of {{air in a}} square enclosure under a nonuniform magnetic field provided by a permanent neodymium-iron-boron magnet is numerically studied.

The physical fields of magnetizing force, velocity, and temperature {{as well as the}} local distribution characteristic of Nusselt number are all presented in this paper. The results show that the buoyancy convection of air in the square enclosure under magnetic field is quite different from that under the gravity field. The local value of Nusselt number under the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>supplied</b> by a permanent magnet with a residual magnetic flux density of about 4. 5 Tesla can reach a high value of about three times larger than the maximum local value of Nusselt number under the gravity field. Relatively uniform distributions of temperature gradient and Nusselt number can be obtained along the cold wall of the enclosure under the magnetic field.

40|$|The Sustained Spheromak Physics Experiment is {{proposed}} for {{experimental studies of}} spheromak confinement issues in a controlled way: in steady state relative to the confinement timescale and at low collisionality. Experiments in a flux - conserver will provide data on transport {{in the presence of}} resistive modes in shear-stabilized systems and establish operating regimes which pave the way for true steady-state experiments with the equilibrium <b>field</b> <b>supplied</b> by external coils. The proposal is based on analysis of past experiments, including the achievement of T{sub e} = 400 eV in a decaying spheromak in CTX. Electrostatic helicity injection from a coaxial ``gun`` into a shaped flux conserver will form and sustain the plasma for several milliseconds. The flux conserver minimizes fluxline intersection with the walls and provides MHD stability. Improvements from previous experiments include modem wall conditioning (especially boronization), a divertor for density and impurity control, and a bias magnetic flux for configurational flexibility. The bias flux will provide innovative experimental opportunities, including testing helicity drive on the large-radius plasma boundary. Diagnostics include Thomson scattering for T{sub e} measurements and ultra-short pulse reflectrometry to measure density and magnetic field profiles and turbulence. We expect to operate at T{sub e} of several hundred eV, allowing improved understanding of energy and current transport due to resistive MHD turbulence during sustained operation. This will provide an exciting advance in spheromak physics and a firm basis for future experiments in the fusion regime...|$|E
40|$|Electromagnetic {{induction}} of ultrasonic waves {{is restricted}} to conducting materials – like eddy current testing – because it involves inducing eddy currents in {{the surface of the}} part by a near-by coil of wire. A magnetic <b>field</b> <b>supplied</b> by a near-by magnet interacts with this eddy current to produce a mechanical force on the surface to excite ultrasonic vibrations. The same configuration of coil and magnet also detects mechanical motion of the surface because the motion of a conductor in a magnetic field produces currents that are detected and measured by the near-by coil. This transduction by induction has the following advantages for NDT: (1) The “near-by ” feature implies an air gap next to the part surface and, thus, no coupling liquid or grease layer is present to restrict the range of temperatures or inspection speeds available for testing. (2) The fact that the transduction process takes place within a thin layer at the surface of the part allows the time-of-flight (or phase) of the ultrasonic wave to be measured with great accuracy so that dimensions and physical properties of materials can be used for quality assurance purposes. (3) The shape of the coil and the direction of the magnetic field allow the type (shear or longitudinal) and direction of propagation of the wave to be controlled by the transducer design. (4) Special wave types (e. g., shear horizontal, Lamb, Rayleigh) are readily available to satisfy unusual inspection problems. (5) Coils that are large or contoured to fit odd shapes are inexpensiv...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis {{has focused on the}} development of a low dose Compton camera for nuclear medicine. A Compton camera composed of two high-purity planar germanium orthogonal-strip detectors has been constructed. Fast digital data acquisition has been utilised for the application of pulse shape analysis techniques. A simple back projection imaging code has been developed and validated with a Geant 4 radiation transport simulation of the Compton camera configuration. L A 137 CS isotropic source and a 22 Na anisotropic source have been experimentally reconstructed. Parametric pulse shape analysis was applied to both data sets and has been shown to increase the detector spatial resolution from a raw granularity of 5 x 5 x 20 mm to a spatial resolution that can be represented by a Gaussian distribution {{with a standard deviation of}} 1. 5 mm < u < 2 mm in all dimensions; this result was in-part derived from Geant 4 simulations. Qualitatively poor images have been shown to result - based wholly on simulation - from Gaussian spatial-resolution distributions that have a standard deviation of greater than 4 mm. A partial experimental basis-data-set has been developed and proved capable of providing 1. 9 mm FWHM average spatial resolution through the depth axis of a single detector crystal. A novel technique to identify gamma ray scattering within single detector c 1 osed-face-pixels - hitherto unrecognised - has also been introduced in this thesis.
