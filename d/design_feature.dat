5|$|The lack of armour on {{both ends}} of the design sparked controversy: after the former Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy Edward James Reed visited the ships under construction, he criticized this {{particular}} <b>design</b> <b>feature,</b> arguing that in case of damage to either end the entering water would have compromised the stability; the new Italian Minister of the Navy, Simone Pacoret di Saint-Bon, replied during a Parliament session that such an event was very unlikely, as it could happen only if all the bulkeads of the watertight compartments were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>design</b> <b>feature</b> of the Mk. XIV {{was that}} it gave the bomb aimer more {{time to work on}} the problem of {{bringing}} the aircraft to the proper location to drop the bombs. As the calculations of this location were being carried out automatically, he could concentrate solely on the sight throughout the bomb run. The sight projected crosshairs into space so they were in focused at infinity, allowing the user to focus their eyes on the target and not have to change focus to see the line.|$|E
5|$|Xgrid's {{original}} concept can {{be traced}} back to Zilla.app, found in the OPENSTEP operating system, created by NeXT in the late 1980s. Zilla was the first distributed computing program released on an end-user operating system and which used the idle screen-saver motif, a <b>design</b> <b>feature</b> since found in widely used projects such as Seti@Home and Distributed.net. Zilla won the national Computerworld Smithsonian Award (Science Category) in 1991 for ease of use and good design. Apple acquired Zilla, along with the rest of NeXT, in 1997 and later used Zilla as inspiration for Xgrid. The first beta version of Xgrid was released in January 2004.|$|E

5|$|The wings {{were of a}} broad 55 m² (590ft²) {{area and}} had a span of 18 m (59ft 0⅝ in) with a {{straight}} leading edge which curved in a near-perfect semicircle into the trailing edge. The positions of the wing roots were offset. The leading edge wing root merged with {{the top of the}} fuselage and cockpit. As the wing extended backwards, by roughly two thirds, it declined downwards at a sharp angle so that the trailing edge wing root ended nearly halfway {{down the side of the}} fuselage increasing the angle of incidence. This <b>design</b> <b>feature</b> was used on all future Dornier bomber designs, namely the Dornier Do 217. The trailing edge was faired into the round fuselage shape. The engine nacelle was also faired into the flaps. The extreme rear of the nacelle was hollow and allowed the flap with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed.|$|E
25|$|A <b>design</b> <b>feature</b> of the {{aircraft}} {{was the use of}} a straight duct air intake design for the vertical stabilizer (tail) mounted engine, similar in engineering design concept to a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, rather than the s-duct arrangement of most trijet aircraft designs such as the Dassault Falcon 900.|$|E
25|$|Another 1974 Gremlin was {{modified}} with a front end from the Hornet. The concept car received a special grille, {{but the most}} radical <b>design</b> <b>feature</b> was its fastback roofline.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{shows that}} effective Online Patient Education (OPE) site can provide significant benefits {{to patients with}} a chronic disease. What remains unclear is which <b>design</b> <b>features</b> make OPE site effective, and which benefits can OPE actually provide. This paper addresses this by i) identifying 29 <b>design</b> <b>features</b> of effective OPE site ii) identifying 13 potential benefits and iii) statistically assessing the validity of both features and benefits using empirical data. The <b>design</b> <b>features</b> were initially classified as: patient tailored information, interactivity, user friendliness, content, and interpretability as necessary <b>design</b> <b>features</b> while the benefits were grouped as health benefits or social benefits. Following pilot testing, 141 patients and carers rated both <b>design</b> <b>features</b> and benefits. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was carried out and changes were made to both the <b>design</b> <b>features</b> and the benefits, resulting in more parsimonious and better organized sets of features and benefits...|$|R

50|$|IDEF4 {{provides}} {{a broad range}} of <b>design</b> <b>features</b> - from generic to specific. This range enables deferred decision making by allowing the designer to first capture <b>design</b> <b>features</b> in general terms and later to refine them. This significantly reduces the burden on designers by allowing them to immediately capture new design concepts with IDEF4 <b>design</b> <b>features,</b> even if these design concepts have not yet been explored in detail.|$|R
25|$|Opera {{windows are}} small {{porthole}} sized side {{windows in the}} C-pillar of some cars. Typically offered in unison with a vinyl roof, they were a very common <b>design</b> <b>feature</b> of American automobiles during the 1970s.

40|$|Patient {{education}} {{plays an}} important role in chronic disease management. The aim of this study is to identify patients’ preferences in regard to the <b>design</b> <b>features</b> of effective online patient education (OPE) and the benefits. A review of the existing literature was conducted in order to identify the benefits of OPE and its essential <b>design</b> <b>features.</b> These <b>design</b> <b>features</b> were empirically tested by conducting survey with patients and caregivers. Reliability analysis, construct validity and regression analysis were performed for data analysis. The results identified patient-tailored information, interactivity, content credibility, clear presentation of content, use of multimedia and interpretability as the essential <b>design</b> <b>features</b> of online patient education websites for chronic disease management...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of a blended learning environment through analyzing the relationship between student characteristics/background, <b>design</b> <b>features</b> and learning outcomes. It is aimed at determining the significant predictors of blended learning effectiveness taking student characteristics/background and <b>design</b> <b>features</b> as independent variables and learning outcomes as dependent variables. A survey was administered to 238 respondents to gather data on student characteristics/background, <b>design</b> <b>features</b> and learning outcomes. The final semester evaluation results were used as a measure for performance as an outcome. We applied the online self regulatory learning questionnaire for data on learner self regulation, the intrinsic motivation inventory for data on intrinsic motivation and other self-developed instruments for measuring the other constructs. Multiple regression analysis results showed that blended learning <b>design</b> <b>features</b> (technology quality, online tools and face-to-face support) and student characteristics (attitudes and self-regulation) predicted student satisfaction as an outcome. The results indicate that some of the student characteristics/backgrounds and <b>design</b> <b>features</b> are significant predictors for student learning outcomes in blended learning.|$|R
25|$|Redstone {{returned}} to Michigan in 1937 {{and opened his}} own practice, starting with many residential commissions. He championed the concept of shared yards, a <b>design</b> <b>feature</b> used in the Appoline houses. In 1938, Louis's brother Sol was married, and in 1939 Louis married Ruth Roslyn Rosenbaum. A few years after this he began designing the houses on Appoline Street for their families.|$|E
25|$|The Be-103 is a mid-wing monoplane, {{making use}} of the {{modified}} wing roots as water-displacing sponsons. It features an all-moving slab tail and retractable tricycle landing gear for land operations. Its hallmark and most distinguishing <b>design</b> <b>feature</b> is the water-displacing wing, an unusual feature for a seaplane, with three aquaplaning implements (planing step, port and starboard wing trailing edges) which substantially enhance the aircraft's on-the-water stability and seaworthiness.|$|E
25|$|A <b>design</b> <b>feature</b> of the Peregrine {{was that}} it was {{produced}} in both right- and left-hand tractor variants. This was done to improve aircraft handling by providing a counter-rotating propeller facility. This was a common feature of German designs, but relatively rare on UK engines. The handing of internal parts to achieve this was a considerable complication that was later abandoned in favour of an idler gear arrangement for the Merlin propeller reduction gear.|$|E

25|$|Both engines {{were located}} behind a single very large ventral {{single-sided}} Ferri intake, which featured a prominent, swept-forward lip, a <b>design</b> <b>feature</b> employed on the Republic RF-84F Thunderstreak and later F-105 Thunderchief. The J67 was installed {{just behind the}} intake, angled with its intake below the centerline of the aircraft. The XJ55 was installed inline with the fuselage in the extreme rear, {{as if it were}} the exhaust of a conventional engine installation. There was a significant empty space above the J67 for ducting.|$|E
25|$|In 1989 Plaxton {{responded to}} a request from the privatised National Express for a further version of Paramount III to be leased to its {{contractors}} by a joint venture of Plaxton, National Westminster Bank and National Express. The Paramount Expressliner was created from the Mark III Paramount on a Volvo chassis and was tailored to National Express' specific requirements which included a closed back with the double N logo etched into the fibre glass rear moulding. This period of coach design seemed to introduce the windowless rear as a <b>design</b> <b>feature</b> for most coaches.|$|E

40|$|The {{linkages}} between energy efficient <b>design</b> <b>features</b> and indoor environmental quality are explored {{with regard to}} behaviour of building users. The physical and environmental conditions in office buildings are investigated {{in the light of}} the hypothesis that occupants’ comfort and overall satisfaction is influenced by certain energy efficient <b>design</b> <b>features</b> and indoor environmental quality. A method is discussed to evaluate the effects of energy efficient <b>design</b> <b>features</b> in office buildings, such as building orientation, open-plan office, day-lighting and double-glazing on indoor environmental quality parameters, such as temperature and relative humidity, lighting and sound pressure levels on occupants’ overall perception of comfort and satisfaction in new office buildings. The paper gives equal emphasis to the application of quantitative and qualitative procedures. The paper also shows results from a pilot study of two buildings, one having a range of energy efficient <b>design</b> <b>features.</b> Preliminary analysis and discussion of the findings indicate a significant role for the cognitive state and psychological factors of the users when individually describing their impression of <b>design</b> <b>features</b> and the indoor environment...|$|R

25|$|The major <b>design</b> <b>feature</b> was the {{introduction}} of a reverse design shared across six coins (1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p), that can be pieced together to form an image of the Royal Shield. This was the first time a coin design had been featured across multiple coins in this way. Completing the set, the new £1 reverse features the Shield in its entirety. The effigy of the Queen, by Ian Rank-Broadley, continued to appear on the obverse of all the coins until 2015 when it was replaced by the fifth and latest portrait, designed by Jody Clark.|$|E
25|$|Beatles for Sale was {{presented}} in a gatefold sleeve – a rare <b>design</b> <b>feature</b> for a contemporary pop LP and {{the first of the}} Beatles' UK releases to be packaged in this way. Part of the inner gatefold spread showed the band members in front of a photo montage of celebrities, including film stars Victor Mature, Jayne Mansfield and Ian Carmichael, all of whom the Beatles had met during 1964.

25|$|The Herald {{attracted}} much early interest {{around the}} world because of its astonishing short field performance and excellent flight characteristics, but Handley Page failed to close many of the deals, as the F-27 and the HS.748 had become rival offerings, both of which proved significantly more popular. A key <b>design</b> <b>feature</b> of the Herald was the high-mounted wing, but with a noticeable dihedral. In addition, the Herald's vertical fin was covered with miniature airfoils, adding further to the Herald's excellent stability. Pilots reported that the Herald flew like a dream; very stable in the air, yet highly manoeuvrable even at slow speed. Ground handling {{was said to be}} the Herald's only vice due to an overlarge tailfin.|$|E
