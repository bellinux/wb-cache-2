40|$|The study {{aimed to}} study the {{accuracy}} in RR time series derived from the seismocardiogram when employing different <b>heartbeat</b> <b>detectors</b> in subjects measured in a quiet environment. The ECG and seismocardiogram of 17 healthy volunteers was recorded at a sampling frequency of 5 kHz using a Biopac acquisition system. The seismocardiogram was acquired using a triaxial accelerometer (LIS 344 ALH, ST Microelectronics). Four <b>detectors</b> of the <b>heartbeat</b> from the seismocardiogram were employed relying either on the Continuous Wavelet Transform or bandpass filtering.

40|$|Abstract — We have {{developed}} a prototype T-shirt with integrated electrodes for wireless monitoring of heart rate and muscular activity. Monitoring of heart rate is insensitive to the actual placement of the textile sensors by recording ECG from many positions of the trunk: This approach {{reduces the risk of}} data loss due to problems in a single channel. A multi-channel <b>heartbeat</b> <b>detector</b> was developed, which is robust to disturbed or even missing ECG-signal in single channels. For recording of electromyographic signals, our current intermediary solution is to use a padded structure above the trapezius muscle housing commercially available dry electrodes. By extra padding over the electrode site, the positions of the electrode are more well-defined and local sweat production is stimulated which enhance the recording conditions. The T-shirt has a specially designed textile electrode system for flexible integration in clothing. Further improvements are needed, but our intention is that our textile T-shirt soon will be available to the research community. In addition to personal health monitoring, the system would allow long-term monitoring of trapezius muscle activity and heart rate variability, indicating psychological stress, which is of high interest in studies of musculoskeletal disorders of the neck and shoulder.

40|$|Objective: Somatosensory {{amplification}} {{has been}} defined as the tendency to experience normal bodily sensations as intense, noxious, and disturbing. The present experiment investigated whether this tendency is due to height-ened physiological sensitivity to bodily sensations. Methods: The relationship between Somatosensory Amplifica-tion Scale (SSAS) scores and objective measures of the ability to detect bodily (ie, heartbeat) sensations derived from the Method of Constant Stimuli procedure was assessed. Although somatosensory amplification characterizes hypochondriacs, the relationship between somatosensory amplification and sensitivity to bodily sensations was examined in nonhypochondriacal, nonpatient participants in an effort to dissociate somatosensory amplification from other variables associated with hypochondriasis and/or patient status. Results: <b>Heartbeat</b> <b>detectors</b> were found to exhibit significantly lower SSAS scores than nondetectors. Conclusion: This finding suggests that somatosensory amplification is not due to heightened sensitivity to bodily sensations.

40|$|Abstract. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) {{provides}} a flexible solution for building loosely coupled distributed applications. Complex applications {{can be designed}} by defining a business process that composes a set of independent software modules called services. In this scenario, each service can be selected and bound dynamically at run-time among a set of candidates that provide the same functionality but differs in quality of service (QoS). However, the QoS values advertised by partner services are not always ensured at run-time. In response to the dynamic execution environment, the execution of a business process has to be adapted onthe-fly in case that a global QoS violation is predicted. In this paper, we introduce a QoS-aware middleware system for dynamic and adaptive service execution. The run-time service selection is modeled as an optimization problem based on user’s end-to-end QoS constraints and preferences on the service composition level. In contrast to the centralized execution engine adopted by most of traditional approaches, the execution of a service composition is decentralized in the middleware. Moreover, Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) and <b>Heartbeat</b> Failure <b>Detector</b> (HB) are introduced as effective approaches to predict global QoS violations and draw appropriate adaptation decisions. ...|$|R

40|$|In the rst {{part of this}} work, {{we design}} the {{algorithm}} for ECG signal analysis and classi- cation and implement it in Matab environment. The database chosen as source for ECG recordings is the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database, provided by PhysioNet. The structure of the algorithm consists of the following stages: ltering, heartbeat detection, heartbeat segmentation, feature extraction, classi cation. The input is an ECG signal, it is ltered, the heartbeats included in it are detected, the signal is segmented into beats, features are extracted from each beat, and {{the output of the}} nal stage is a label (Normal or Abnormal) for each heartbeat. For the implementation of these stages we used Matlab built-in functions, the LIBSVM library for the SVM classi er used, and also functions provided by PhysioNet in the WFDB Matlab toolkit. The classi cation stage consists of a SVM classi er, a supervised machine learning method. We use annotations les included in the database, which provide diagnosis labeling of each heartbeat included in each ECG recording, done by doctors. The problem detected at this point of the analysis, {{is that there is a}} mismatch in the heartbeats detected in a recording by the functions provided in the toolkit, and the heartbeats annotated by the doctors. This happens because <b>heartbeat</b> <b>detectors</b> fail to detect all heartbeats and some false detections also take place. We overcome this problem by forming a procedure that allows us to match the correctly detected heartbeats with their corresponding labels in the annotation les. Next, we perform a design space exploration over di erent features extracted from the signal in the feature extraction stage. We use discrete wavelet transform as feature extraction method. These features serve as input for the classi cation stage. The metrics used to decide upon the best design are the accuracy and computational cost of the classi cation stage. In the second part of the analysis, we suggest the addition of an extra stage to the algorithmic structure. This stage is placed right before the nal classi cation stage, and consists of an SVM classi er that would take as input the features extracted in the previous stage and classify the heartbeats as true or false detections. True beats will continue to the nal stage, while false beats will be discarded. A design space exploration is performed similarly as done in the initial structure. In the last part of the analysis, the initial algorithmic ow is implemented on the Intel IoT based Galileo board. To do so, the algorithm is converted in C code. In its nal form, the program reads sample by sample a digitized at 360 samples per second ECG signal, and the analysis ow is executed for every set of 3000 samples that is read. The 10 best con gurations, the 10 most demanding in computational cost con gurations, as well as 11 con gurations from inbetween, as resulted from the design space exploration in the rst part of the work, were implemented on the Galileo board. The accuracies achieved were above satisfactory, and the computational cost was such so that the ECG analysis and classi cation can be performed in real-time...|$|R
