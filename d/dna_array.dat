40|$|Abstract Background The {{rapid and}} {{accurate}} identification of species {{is a critical}} component of large-scale biodiversity monitoring programs. <b>DNA</b> <b>arrays</b> (micro and macro) and DNA barcodes are two molecular approaches that have recently garnered much attention. Here, we compare these two platforms for identification of an important group, the mammals. Results Our analyses, based on the two commonly used mitochondrial genes cytochrome c oxidase I (the standard DNA barcode for animal species) and cytochrome b (a common species-level marker), suggest that both arrays and barcodes are capable of discriminating mammalian species with high accuracy. We used three different datasets of mammalian species, comprising different sampling strategies. For <b>DNA</b> <b>arrays</b> we designed three probes for each species to address intraspecific variation. As for DNA barcoding, our analyses show that both cytochrome c oxidase I and cytochrome b genes, and even smaller fragments of them (mini-barcodes) can successfully discriminate species {{in a wide variety of}} specimens. Conclusion This study showed that <b>DNA</b> <b>arrays</b> and <b>DNA</b> barcodes are valuable molecular methods for biodiversity monitoring programs. Both approaches were capable of discriminating among mammalian species in our test assemblages. However, because designing <b>DNA</b> <b>arrays</b> require advance knowledge of target sequences, the use of this approach could be limited in large scale monitoring programs where unknown haplotypes might be encountered. DNA barcodes, by contrast, are sequencing-based and therefore could provide more flexibility in large-scale studies. </p...|$|R

The SPR difference image is only detected for the sequence having cytosine (C) base at the X position in sequence 1, the complementary sequence to sequence 2. However, the SPR difference image corresponding to the addition of sequence 2 {{in the presence of}} the naphthyridine dimer shows that, in addition to its complement, sequence 2 also hybridizes to the sequence that forms a G-G mismatch.

50|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>array</b> to {{protein array}} (DAPA) {{is a method}} {{developed}} in 2007 to repeatedly produce protein arrays by ‘printing’ them from a single DNA template array, on demand (Figure 5). It starts with the spotting and immobilization of an array of DNA templates onto a glass slide. The slide is then assembled face-to-face with a second slide pre-coated with a protein-capturing reagent, and a membrane soaked with cell extract is placed between the two slides for transcription and translation to take place. The newly synthesized his-tagged proteins are then immobilized onto the slide to form the array. In the publication in 18 of 20 replications a protein microarray copy could be generated. Potentially the process can be repeated as often as needed, {{as long as the}} DNA is unharmed by DNAses, degradation or mechanical abrasion.|$|E

50|$|Proteins {{are highly}} {{sensitive}} {{to changes in}} their microenvironment. This presents a challenge in maintaining protein arrays in a stable condition over extended periods of time. In situ methods involve on-chip synthesis of proteins as and when required, directly from the DNA using cell-free protein expression systems. Since DNA is a highly stable molecule it does not deteriorate over time and is therefore suited to long-term storage. This approach is also advantageous in that it circumvents the laborious and often costly processes of separate protein purification and DNA cloning, since proteins are made and immobilised simultaneously in a single step on the chip surface. Examples of in situ techniques are PISA (protein in situ array), NAPPA (nucleic acid programmable protein array) and DAPA (<b>DNA</b> <b>array</b> to protein array).|$|E
50|$|In their procedure, Hardenbol et al. assayed {{more than}} 1000 SNP loci {{simultaneously}} {{in a single}} tube where the tube contained more than 1000 probes with distinct designs. The pool of probes was aliquoted into four tubes for four different reactions. In each reaction, a distinct nucleotide (A, T, C or G) was used for gap filling. Only when the nucleotide at the SNP locus was complementary to the applied nucleotide would the gap be closed by ligation and the probe be circularized. Identification of the captured SNPs was performed on genotyping arrays where each spot on the array contained sequences complementary to the locus-specific tags in the probes. Since the <b>DNA</b> <b>array</b> costs is {{a major contributor to}} the cost of this technique, the performance of four-chip-one-color detection was compared to two-chip-two color detection.
