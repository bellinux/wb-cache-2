So it is important to develop a new method to make a <b>flat</b> <b>gear</b> teeth by plastic deformation of the ingot. The article deals with the actual problem of improving productivity and quality of plane wheels teeth that are widely used in advanced wave, planetary and other transmissions. A progressive method to produce <b>flat</b> <b>gear</b> teeth gear by plastic deformation of the ingot with two knurl rollers alternately moving reciprocally in the direction not intersecting the axis of the ingot mounting surface has been described in the article. The working surface of the rollers corresponds to the resulting shape of the teeth. The schemes of the teeth installing and knurling have been shown. The necessary material and the heat treatment of the knurling tools have been described.  Its use will significantly increase the wear resistance of the working surfaces of the teeth and their durability as well as to increase productivity and its manufacturing costs. The material of the rollers is BC 15 steel. The surface layer of the knurling tools was subjected to nitration, surface hardness being up to 65 HRC. Knurling is made in the 5236 P shaper suited for this purpos...|$|E

50|$|The 190/195 has <b>flat</b> sprung-steel landing <b>gear</b> legs {{derived from}} Cessna's {{purchase}} of the rights to Steve Wittman's Big X. Many have been equipped with swiveling crosswind landing gear which allows landing with up to 15 degrees of crab. While the crosswind gear simplifies the actual landing, it makes the aircraft difficult to handle on the ground. The 195 {{is equipped with a}} retractable step that extends when the cabin door is opened, although some have been modified to make the step a fixed unit.|$|R
40|$|Computational {{modeling}} is {{a valuable}} complementary tool to assess behavior of bottom trawl fishing gears. A simplified model of the gear that mainly affects to the net is proposed. The model is constrained to steady towing conditions, <b>flat</b> seabed and <b>gear</b> symmetry. Simulations proportionate a number of relevant outcomes like distribution of tensions at the warp, balance of forces at the otterboards or spread under different haul conditions such as depth or towing speed. In this paper we mainly focuss on the description {{and implementation of the}} model. Nevertheless, some preliminar comparison with experimental data is also shown...|$|R
5000|$|The same {{procedure}} {{is used to}} make printed circuit boards, foil-stamping dies and embossing dies. It {{is also used to}} make nameplates, commemorative plaques and other decorative engravings. It {{can be used to make}} <b>flat</b> springs, levers, <b>gears</b> and other practical components that would otherwise be fabricated from sheet metal by cutting, drilling, jigsawing or stamping. A very high degree of precision is possible. In these applications, it is properly called photochemical machining, but the terms photochemical milling, chemical milling and photoetching are sometimes used. A similar process called photolithography is used to make integrated circuits.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{the work}} is to study the {{phenomenon}} of profile cutting gear hobbing cutters in spatial gearing Hiller -wheel and the development of recommendations to reduce the impact of this phenomenon and to increase efficiency of cutters that cut gears with few teeth. Design/methodology/approach. The dependencies to find the cusps (singular point) {{on the surface of the}} gear, which is formed by a helical initial tool surface milling. Defined and investigated the influence of the design parameters of hobs on cropping profile gears. Their comparative analysis with the case where the surface of the gear rack is formed <b>flat.</b> Keywords: <b>gears,</b> helical milling, cutting tools, pruning. Findings. On the basis of the research proposed design of the worm milling cutter for making gears with few teeth, which yields a profile without cutting gear and by that on the secondary side of the edge profile angle cutter such greater angle as standard cutters and the back side angle will be more important than standard cutters, consequently proposed cutters should have greater efficiency. ? ?????? ??????????????? ?????? ??????? ?? ?????????? ???????? ??????? ???????? ????? ??? ???????????????? ?????????? ???????. ??????????? ??????????? ??? ?????????? ????? ????????

2500|$|Distinctive {{features}} included wheeled tricycle landing <b>gear,</b> <b>flat</b> canopy window plates, {{an unusual}} [...] "tee" [...] tail, a large ventral fin, and a three-barreled General Electric XM-188 [...] cannon. The YAH-63's rotor mast could be lowered and {{the landing gear}} could kneel to reduce its height for transport. One less noticeable feature was that the pilot occupied the front seat instead of the rear, the reverse of the AH-1's arrangement. This {{was believed to be}} more prudent since the YAH-63 was intended to fly [...] "in the treetops" [...] during [...] "nap-of-the-earth" [...] (NoE) operations, and the pilot needed to have {{a clear view of the}} aircraft's surroundings.|$|R
50|$|The German Grand Prix at the {{ultra-fast}} Hockenheimring was {{marred by}} the fatal pre-race testing accident of Patrick Depailler at the ultra-high speed, top <b>gear,</b> <b>flat</b> out Ost-Kurve 9 days before the race. Suspension failure on his Alfa caused him to crash massively after his car overturned and vaulted the barriers, causing fatal head injuries. Alan Jones took pole from Renault driver Jabouille by mere hundredths of a second, and he led the race until {{he had to come}} in with a puncture on the straight before the stadium. Laffite and Reutemann passed Jones, who finished 3rd. Laffite went on to win for Ligier, followed by the Williams duo of Reutemann and Jones.|$|R
50|$|Both Zakspeed turbos {{failed to}} qualify for the race showing the cars' lack of {{handling}} and lack of power from the team's own 4 cylinder engines with Bernd Schneider the slowest of the 30 drivers, some 7.9 seconds slower than Berger's Ferrari. His experienced teammate Piercarlo Ghinzani fared little better, being almost 6 seconds slower than the Ferrari. Also failing to make the grid were the EuroBrun of Oscar Larrauri and the Ligier of Stefan Johansson who, as usual, complained of very little grip from his JS31 (upon hearing Maurício Gugelmin tell of being able to take Club corner <b>flat</b> in top <b>gear</b> in his March 881, Johansson told it wasn't like that in the Ligier, adding that even in the dry it took a wet weather technique to drive it). The Coloni of Gabriele Tarquini failed to pre-qualify, ironically with a faster time than Schneider managed in qualifying.|$|R
