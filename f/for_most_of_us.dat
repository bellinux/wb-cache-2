500|$|Writing for The Columbian, Angela Allen {{commented that}} {{the first issue of}} the {{magazine}} [...] "shows attitude and literary writing, tosses off lots of names, does a terrific fall culture calendar and digs into a couple of issues, including the Trail Blazers", but was also critical, noting: [...] "Its design is crowded and the type is too small to read <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> without wearing a pair of 'reader' specs." [...] Tom Boyer of The Seattle Times described the magazine as [...] "a smart mix of reader-friendly features and award-winning journalism". Writing in The Oregonian, Steve Duin commented that he appreciated the lists published in the magazine: [...] "Because I'm addicted to lists -- and the bigger the better -- the best part of my month is the morning that copy of Portland Monthly lands like a wounded halibut on my desk." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Gizmodo {{concluded}} {{it to be}} [...] "our favorite MacBook to date," [...] {{they did}} claim, at this time, its display was inferior to that found on the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, alleging a smaller viewing angle, washed-out colors, and dimmer backlighting. Similarly, AppleInsider and Engadget concluded it [...] "may well be Apple's best MacBook to date" [...] and [...] "these are terrific choices—not only from an industrial design standpoint, but in specs as well" [...] respectively, while also drawing attention to a lower quality display {{as compared with the}} MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. Charlie Sorrel of Wired News reached a similar conclusion about the MacBook display, citing its poor contrast and lack of vertical angle in comparison with the MacBook Pro and even the older white MacBook. Peter Cohen wrote an article discussing the loss of the FireWire port for Macworld, saying [...] "The absence of FireWire ports is certainly an inconvenience for some users. But it shouldn’t be considered a deal-breaker <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Ed Park {{singled out}} the author's prose for praise, proclaiming that [...] "entence for sentence, few authors equal Gibson's {{gift for the}} terse yet poetic description, the quotable simile – people and {{products}} are nailed down with a beautiful precision approximating the platonic ideal of the catalog". Matt Thorne noted that while he found Gibson's tendency towards hyper-specificity initially irritating, [...] "there's hypnotic quality to the relentless cataloguing". The author's prose was also extolled by Clay Evans of the Daily Camera, and by Benjamin Lytal in The New York Sun, who declared that [...] "the real news, in Spook Country, is {{that much of the}} flair that Mr. Gibson once brought to descriptions of cyberspace seems to fit perfectly, now, on all kinds of things." [...] In The Seattle Times, Nisi Shawl gushed that [...] "ven without the high cool quotient of the novel's contents, the pleasure of Gibson's prose would be enough inducement <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to immerse ourselves in this book...." [...] Simon Cooper of The Book Show agreed with the commendations of Gibson's prose, but felt the plot and characterization let the book down: ...|$|E

500|$|His {{position}} persuaded MTV {{to begin}} airing [...] "Billie Jean" [...] and later [...] "Beat It", (along with Prince's [...] "Little Red Corvette") {{which led to}} a long partnership and later helped other black music artists to gain mainstream recognition. MTV denies claims of racism in their broadcasting. The popularity of his videos, such as [...] "Beat It" [...] and [...] "Billie Jean", helped to place the young channel [...] "on the map" [...] and MTV's focus shifted in favor of pop and R Jackson transformed the medium of music video into an art form and promotional tool through the use of complex story lines, dance routines, special effects and cameo appearances by well known personalities. When the 14-minute-long Thriller video aired, MTV ran it twice an hour to meet demand. The short film marked an increase in scale for music videos and has been routinely named the best music video ever. The popularity of the video sent the album back to number one in the album chart, but Jackson's label did not support the release of the third music video from the album. They were already pleased with its success, so Jackson convinced MTV to fund the project. Author, music critic and journalist Nelson George wrote in 2004, [...] "It's difficult to hear the songs from Thriller and disengage them from the videos. <b>For</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> the images define the songs. In fact {{it could be argued that}} Michael is the first artist of the MTV age to have an entire album so intimately connected in the public imagination with its imagery". Short films like Thriller largely remained unique to Jackson, while the group dance sequence in [...] "Beat It" [...] has been frequently imitated. The choreography in Thriller has become a part of global pop culture, replicated everywhere from Bollywood to prisons in the Philippines.|$|E
