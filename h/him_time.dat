5|$|From 1921 to 1923 Wilson taught {{music at}} Bedales School, an {{appointment}} that left <b>him</b> <b>time</b> to take singing engagements {{all over the}} United Kingdom. In 1924 he left the English Singers and furthered his singing studies abroad, first in Nice with Jean de Reszke (1924–25), with whom he learned the roles of Otello, Parsifal and Tristan; he then took lessons with Sir George Henschel (1925–28), and studied 17th- and 18th-century music with Wanda Landowska in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Had Napoleon {{succeeded in}} {{destroying}} the existing coalition forces south of Brussels {{before they were}} reinforced, {{he might have been}} able to drive the British back to the sea and knock the Prussians out of the war.

5|$|In the meantime, Miller had the {{upcoming}} Test series against England in 1946–47 {{to look forward}} to. He therefore approached his employers for two months leave {{so that he could}} travel to the United States to marry Wagner, which would allow <b>him</b> <b>time</b> to return in preparation for the international series. Vacuum Oil refused, so, with the comfort of job security in England, Miller resigned.|$|E

5|$|Trumble {{joined the}} National Bank of Australasia in 1887 {{to begin a}} career in banking. While the bank often allowed <b>him</b> <b>time</b> to practice, his {{frequent}} absences with cricket meant his career progression was slow; after each of his five tours of England he returned to find junior bank officers promoted over him. Nevertheless, he was appointed accountant at the Richmond branch in 1903 and after his retirement from cricket in 1908, manager of the Kew branch.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the gardens}} thrived {{in their early}} years, by 1842 Jennison was in {{financial}} difficulties, and on 13December bankruptcy proceedings were initiated. Jennison's problems were caused by his failure to sell the Strawberry Gardens property, competition from the recently opened Manchester Zoological Gardens, and the Manchester and Birmingham Railway track cutting through the land Jennison had leased in December 1836, restricting access to the gardens. Jennison twice tried unsuccessfully to sell Belle Vue, after which his creditors allowed <b>him</b> <b>time</b> to make a success of the gardens; {{by the end of}} the 1843 season Jennison was able to repay his debts. The railway that had been a thorn in his side eventually proved to be an asset when Longsight railway station was re-sited closer to Belle Vue in 1842, making it easier for visitors to reach the gardens.|$|E
5|$|Despite those players' {{performance}}s, {{the game}} was decided in the running game {{and the performance of}} the two teams' offensive and defensive lines. Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh was praised for adjusting his team's strategy at halftime, allowing it to succeed in the second half. Stanford's rushing offense accounted for 247 yards, while its defensive line limited Virginia Tech to just 67 yards rushing. The Stanford defense also sacked Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor eight times, denying <b>him</b> <b>time</b> to pass the ball accurately.|$|E

5|$|In Zürich, Vermigli succeeded Konrad Pellikan as {{the chair}} of Hebrew, a {{position}} he would hold until his death. He married his second wife, Catarina Merenda of Brescia, Italy, in 1559.

5|$|Kenny Bräck won {{the pole}} {{position}} and maintained his advantage {{heading into the}} first lap. He led {{for a total of}} 134 laps, more than any other competitor. Franchitti employed a strategy that enabled him to drive in clean air while other drivers made pit stops. Bräck reclaimed the lead for the lap-163 restart, but lost it six laps later when a crew member dropped a wheel nut which cost <b>him</b> <b>time.</b> Franchitti took over the lead and held it {{for the remainder of the}} event to clinch the victory. It was Franchitti's third win of the season, his first on an oval track, and the tenth (and final) of his CART career. There were five cautions and nine lead changes during the course of the race.|$|E

At the time of his announcement, McGovern ranked fifth among Democrats in a presidential preference Gallup Poll.

5|$|The loan {{was twice}} {{extended}} {{for a further}} month, and on 11 November 2002 Gill left Birmingham permanently, signing for Northampton {{until the end of}} the season. His season proceeded successfully– a new two-year contract had been discussed, and he finished as runner-up for the club's Player of the Year award– until with two games remaining he damaged his anterior cruciate ligament and was expected to be out for several months. Northampton were prepared to give him a six-month contract, albeit on reduced wages, to allow <b>him</b> <b>time</b> to recover and prove his fitness. Birmingham City allowed him to use their facilities for his rehabilitation, and he recovered sufficiently to play a couple of reserve games for Northampton, but by that time new manager Colin Calderwood had other players in Gill's position and he was not offered another contract.|$|E

5|$|To {{supplement}} {{his income}} and {{help pay for}} his legal training, Druitt worked as an assistant schoolmaster at George Valentine's boarding school, 9 Eliot Place, Blackheath, London, from 1880. The school had a long and distinguished history; Benjamin Disraeli had been a pupil there in the 1810s, and boys from the school had been playmates of a younger son of Queen Victoria, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, who as a boy in the 1860s had lived nearby at Greenwich Park. Druitt's post came with accommodation in Eliot Place, and the long school holidays gave <b>him</b> <b>time</b> to study the law and to pursue his interest in cricket.|$|E
5|$|De la Rosa and Irvine {{qualified}} in {{ninth and}} eleventh positions respectively for Jaguar; the pair {{were separated by}} Trulli in the Jordan who's engine failed on his third run {{and was unable to}} return to the pit lane to use his team's spare car. The three drivers were ahead of Villeneuve in the faster of the two BAR cars, who in turn, qualified in front of teammate Panis; both drivers struggled to find grip throughout the one-hour period. Alesi qualified in 14th position, more than four tenths of a second in front of Prost teammate Luciano Burti; the latter spun off in the circuit's stadium section which caused a yellow flag to be shown. The two were split by Zonta in the slower Jordan car who drove over a kerb at the Senna chicane on his third run of the session which lost <b>him</b> <b>time</b> and he encountered slower cars. The Benetton cars filled the ninth row of the grid with Fisichella 17th and Button 18th; the latter's car had its gearbox changed and pulled {{to the side of the}} track with a failed engine. Behind them, the Arrows drivers managed to qualify in 18th and 19th; Enrique Bernoldi qualifying ahead of Jos Verstappen. Bernoldi improved his car's handling although his potential best run was disrupted because of Button's engine failure and Verstappen spun on his final timed lap. The starting order was completed by Fernando Alonso and Tarso Marques in the Minardi cars.|$|E
5|$|From January 1918 to January 1921 Poulenc was a conscript in the French Army in {{the last}} months of the First World War and the {{immediate}} post-war period. Between July and October 1918 he served at the Franco-German front, after which he was given a series of auxiliary posts, ending as a typist at the Ministry of Aviation. His duties allowed <b>him</b> <b>time</b> for composition; the Trois mouvements perpétuels for piano and the Sonata for Piano Duet were written at the piano of the local elementary school at Saint-Martin-sur-le-Pré, and he completed his first song cycle, Le bestiaire, setting poems by Apollinaire. The sonata did not create a deep public impression, but the song cycle made the composer's name known in France, and the Trois mouvements perpétuels rapidly became an international success. The exigencies of music-making in wartime taught Poulenc much about writing for whatever instruments were available; then, and later, some of his works were for unusual combinations of players.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} two Tests, Hutton shared three {{consecutive}} century opening partnerships with Cyril Washbrook. A four-hour 94 in the first innings was followed by 76 in the second. Press opinion was divided over Hutton's performance; some critics, including the Australian bowlers, detected insecurity against fast bowling, particularly the bouncers with which Ray Lindwall and Miller targeted him. Hutton's preferred tactic of ducking under the ball reinforced {{the impression that he}} was afraid. In the final Test, Hutton scored a century, batting through the first day to score 122 not out, his first Test century in Australia, despite another barrage from Lindwall and Miller. The Sydney Morning Herald criticised the high number of short balls bowled by the Australian pacemen, bowled at Hutton as often as three times per over. After the second day was rained off, Hutton was taken ill overnight with tonsillitis, missed the remainder of the match and flew home soon after. In all first-class matches on tour, Hutton scored 1,267 runs at an average of 70.38, while in the Tests, he managed 417 runs at an average of 52.12; he topped both sets of averages. Wisden noted that it took <b>him</b> <b>time</b> to find form in the Tests, but that he often batted well despite ill health. Bill Bowes, covering the tour as a journalist, believed that Hutton was unable to master bowling faster than he had encountered for eight years, but acquitted himself reasonably well.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} group of five runners, Prost paced the session, nearly three-tenths of a second faster than Félix da Costa in second, and Lopez third. D'Ambrosio and Ma Qinghua (who was unable to {{complete}} a maximum power lap) were the group's two slowest drivers. Buemi was the fastest driver in the second group, half a second ahead of teammate Turvey. Heidfeld, Sarazzin, and Evans rounded out the top five. In the third group, Vergne recorded the overall fastest time of any competitor in the group stages at one minute and 20.993 seconds. Di Grassi qualified 12th overall after narrowly avoiding colliding with the wall between the sixth and seventh turns. His teammate Abt was second quickest in the group, ahead of di Grassi, Maro Engel, and Duval (who went wide on his timed lap which was recorded on reduced power). Rosenqvist immediately employed his car's full power capacity and was the fastest driver in the fourth (and last) group. He finished ahead of Bird, who equalled Vergne's pace at first, but then his rear tyre made contact with the wall which cost <b>him</b> <b>time.</b> Piquet was third on his fastest lap which saw him make contact with the wall once. Robin Frijns and Adam Carroll were the slowest drivers of the fourth group; the latter locked his rear tyres and went wide at the first corner, resulting in him starting 20th (and last). At the end of the group qualifying stage, Rosenqvist, Vergne, Buemi, Bird and Piquet were the five drivers to qualify for the Super Pole round.|$|E
5|$|Kubica had {{problems}} when running the soft compound tyre managing seventh but {{was happy with}} his lap in the final part of qualifying. He was ahead of Massa in the faster of the two Ferrari cars. Petrov secured ninth in the slower Renault car. Kobayashi rounded out the top ten fastest qualifiers. Sutil was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session in eleventh; his best time of 1:27.525 was eight tenths of a second slower than Vettel's pace in the second session. Alonso recorded the twelfth fastest time and could not secure {{a position in the}} final session as his car touched a white line under braking on the circuit, causing his car to slide. Nevertheless, Alonso thought that the error did not cost <b>him</b> <b>time.</b> He was followed by Pedro de la Rosa in the other Sauber car in 13th, who in turn, was ahead of Sébastien Buemi for Torro Rosso and Williams driver Rubens Barrichello. This formation continued on the eighth row of the grid, which was occupied by Jaime Alguersuari in the second Torro Rosso and Nico Hülkenberg in the other Williams. Vitantonio Liuzzi failed to move beyond the first session; the Force India driver qualified in 18th. The Lotus cars of Heikki Kovalainen and Jarno Trulli lined up in 19th and 20th respectively. Timo Glock and Bruno Senna lined up on the eleventh row of the grid, with their teammates Lucas di Grassi and Karun Chandhok qualifying {{at the rear of the}} field.|$|E
