5000|$|The first {{hypodermic}} needle {{was first used}} by Dr. Alexander Wood and immediately {{efforts were made to}} improve the design. It was not until 1954, with the need for massive syringe distribution of Dr. Salk's polio vaccine, that the first <b>disposable</b> <b>syringes</b> were created. Initially made of glass, in 1961 plastic <b>disposable</b> <b>syringes</b> became available. [...] The advent of the first low dead space syringe occurred with the creation of 1-ml syringes designed specifically for the administration of insulin. Then amongst the scare of HIV and rising concern of other communicable diseases to healthcare workers the creation of safety syringes occurred in 1988. As of the last few years new designs have emerged that work on a needle that is low dead space and fits onto and transforms high dead space syringes into low dead space syringes. One design achieves this by creating a plunger that inserts itself into the syringe neck to expel as much fluid as possible from the syringe body, thus reducing the amount of space available within the neck.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, {{after more}} than 60 million mops had been sold around the world, the company stocks were sold to the Dutch {{multinational}} Curver BV. After this, Jalón worked on other inventions, notably the <b>disposable</b> <b>syringe,</b> which was also a success. This type of syringe had a plunger less prone to stick; it was made from plastic instead of glass, and with thin walls making disposal easier. They were first produced by the Fabersanitas factory at Fraga (Huesca province) and were exported to over 80 countries. The factory was later bought by the Becton Dickinson group.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Wood can {{be largely}} {{credited}} with the popularization and acceptance of injection as a medical technique, {{as well as the}} widespread use and acceptance of the hypodermic needle. The basic technology of the hypodermic needle has stayed largely unchanged since the 19th century, but as the years progressed and medical and chemical knowledge improved, small refinements have been made to increase safety and efficacy, with needles being designed and tailored for very particular uses. The trend of needle specification for use began in the 1920s, particularly for the administration of insulin to diabetics. The onset of World War II spurred the early development of partially disposable syringes for the administration of morphine and penicillin on the battlefield. Development of the fully disposable hypodermic needle was spurred on in the 1950s for several reasons. The Korean War created blood shortages and in response disposable, sterile syringes were developed for collecting blood. The widespread immunization against polio during the period required the development of a fully <b>disposable</b> <b>syringe</b> system.|$|E

In 1949, it opened its first manufacturing site outside of New Jersey in Columbus, Nebraska. In 1961, it established a manufacturing facility in Canaan, Connecticut. BD also soon expanded to Canada (1951), Mexico (1952), France (1955), and Brazil (1956). The tenure of Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Jr. and Henry P. Becton was also a time of significant product innovation. In 1950, BD's first sterile disposable product, a blood collection set, was developed and sold to the American Red Cross. In 1954, BD introduced the first completely <b>disposable</b> <b>syringe</b> made of glass: BD Hypak. This innovative product was used in a large-scale field test of the polio vaccine developed by Dr. Jonas Salk.

5000|$|After {{finishing}} his {{tour of duty}} with the Air Force in the Netherlands, Heilman returned to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. To support his family, he took part-time jobs working as an emergency room physician. Medrad Inc was incorporated in February, 1964. The name Medrad is an acronym for medical research and development. Medrad rented space in the Saint John's Health and Emergency Center, located in Pittsburgh's North Hills. Heilman, Rudy Kranys, and a few consultants began developing Medrad's first product, a flow controlled angiographic injector. The [...] "better mousetrap' injector had two important innovations. The first was to measure the flow rate of the injected contrast media, and adjust, in real time, the injector's power {{to insure that the}} actual injection flow rate was as desired. Image quality was optimized when the proper concentration of contrast medium was reached in the blood stream. The other innovation was to use special transparent syringe reinforcing jackets to enable <b>disposable</b> <b>syringes</b> to withstand injection pressures as high as 1,000 PSI. The ability to use <b>disposable</b> <b>syringes</b> prevented blood borne infection transmission from patient to patient. In Medrad's first six years, there were financial losses but expenses were kept to a minimum. In addition to part-time emergency room employment, Heilman worked as a consultant to the Westinghouse Electric Corporation on a National Institutes of Health funded effort to develop an intra-aortic balloon heart assist device.|$|R
