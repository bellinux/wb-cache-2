[...] "It <b>forces</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be honest." [...] Nearly 400 residents have graduated from the program since its inception. Of those, close to seventy percent are reported to remain drug-free, well above the results of traditional recovery methods.|$|E

It's a story, it's me battling all my monsters along the way. I'm playing all the music from The Fame, all the music from The Fame Monster. And the stage that I designed with the Haus [...] is a giant cube that sits. Imagine you were to hollow out a TV and just break the fourth wall on a TV screen. It <b>forces</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> look {{at the center of the}} TV. It's my way of saying, 'My music is art.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2001, Moore further {{explained}} his opposition, citing how a reader {{can take the}} time to absorb the character backgrounds, by having the option of turning back the pages so that they can connect elements they had just read to past elements, but that film <b>forces</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> watch the story at 24 frames per second. Moore's opposition to the film adaptation crystallized after the 2003 film version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was released, and he intends to give any resulting royalties from Watchmen to the comic's artist, Dave Gibbons. In Moore’s opinion, Hayter’s script was the closest anyone could get to the original comic, but added {{that he would not be}} going to see the film when completed. Moore said, [...] "My book is a comic book. Not a movie, not a novel. A comic book. It's been made in a certain way, and designed to be read a certain way: in an armchair, nice and cozy next to a fire, with a steaming cup of coffee." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics, ranging from largely positive to negative. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an A–, calling it [...] "gorgeously shot", citing the [...] "lush, smoky gaming sequences" [...] in particular. Television Without Pity ranked [...] "Hell Money" [...] the eleventh most nightmare-inducing {{episode of the}} show noting, [...] "If there’s one thing you don’t want to mess with, it’s the Chinese mafia. Especially the branch that dresses up like Slipknot and either a) burns you alive, if you’re lucky, or b) <b>forces</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> participate in a haunted organ-harvesting raffle only to slowly carve you up and sell your vital organs on the black market, {{whether you like it}} or not." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, and called it a [...] "hard episode to love [...] sincere and purposeful". The two praised the conceit of the episode, arguing that by presenting the situation from the Chinese immigrants—members of an alien culture—and Chao's point of view, [...] "Mulder and Scully seem clumsy and arrogant. And by implication, the audience are made to feel just as arrogant." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} to exert control {{in every aspect}} of production aside from mastering came from obsession. He said, [...] "I felt like, this way the album is even more my heart and soul, my blood, sweat, and tears." [...] Parker set a deadline to complete the record because of his tendency to procrastinate; he described having a deadline as [...] "a blessing in disguise because it <b>forces</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> make decisions there and then. Which in the end makes for good art." [...] Currents was due to be completed in January 2015, but the deadline was pushed back several times. Late in the process, he became self-conscious about the honesty of his lyrics. He became obsessive about minor details in the work, making him unable to wholly enjoy it upon its completion. Shortly before its release, he said, [...] "I still think this album is completely unlistenable." ...|$|E

60|$|I should compare Rubens to Shakspeare, for the {{wonderful}} variety and vital {{force of his}} artistic power. I know no other mind he so nearly resembles. Like Shakspeare, he <b>forces</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> accept and to forgive a thousand excesses, and uses his own faults as musicians use discords, only to enhance the perfection of harmony. There certainly is some use even in defects. A faultless style sends you to sleep. Defects rouse and excite the sensibility to seek and appreciate excellences. Some of Shakspeare's finest passages explode all grammar and rhetoric like skyrockets--the thought blows the language to shivers.|$|E

Farewell, Monsieur Campbell, I have not so many friends that I can afford to lose so true and stout a one, especially one upon whom misfortunes have come through his good services to myself.

Truly, my friendship for you is genuine, and it cuts me to the heart that, although I could uphold you against the most powerful nobles in open enmity, I can do naught to save you from assassination. I trust some day that I may see you again, but, should it not be so, remember that I shall always feel myself your debtor; and should you have friends for whom you may ask my protection be sure that I will for your sake do all in my power for them." ...|$|E
