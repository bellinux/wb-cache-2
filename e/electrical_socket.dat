However, Bart drinks 12 glasses of water to wake up early and secretly unwraps his gifts, one of which is a remote-controlled fire truck. Bart plays with it until it sprays water on an overloaded <b>electrical</b> <b>socket,</b> causing a fire that engulfs and melts the plastic Christmas tree and all of the presents beneath it. Bart hides the evidence outside beneath the snow in the front yard.|$|E

5|$|In February 1991, Icke {{visited a}} pre-Inca Sillustani burial ground near Puno, Peru, where he felt {{drawn to a}} {{particular}} circle of waist-high stones.

His body shook as though plugged into an <b>electrical</b> <b>socket,</b> he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended.

5|$|Within {{some of the}} {{destroyed}} suburbs, {{a limited}} postal system between various Robinson groups was established. Dawid Landau {{had served as a}} bodyguard to the courier of the Polish government in exile, Jan Karski, while Karski secretly entered the ghetto to gather information for a report on the extermination of Polish Jews by Nazi Germany for the Western allies, in 1943. Later, Landau fought in both of the Warsaw uprising as part of Żydowski Związek Wojskowy (Jewish Military Union, ŻZW) and afterward decided to stay in the ruins. In his memoirs he reports that the post functioned through the use of empty <b>electrical</b> <b>socket</b> boxes. Various groups would leave notes for others informing them of who was alive and in hiding, news from the front that had been obtained, as well as requests for special forms of assistance. According to Landau, the most common pleas were for doctors or other forms of medical help.|$|E

25|$|Bed bugs {{can exist}} singly, but tend to congregate once established. Though {{strictly}} parasitic, they spend {{only a tiny}} fraction of their lifecycles physically attached to hosts. Once a bed bug finishes feeding, it relocates to a place close to a known host, commonly in or near beds or couches in clusters of adults, juveniles, and eggs—which entomologists call harborage areas or simply harborages to which the insect returns after future feedings by following chemical trails. These places can vary greatly in format, including luggage, inside of vehicles, within furniture, amongst bedside clutter—even inside <b>electrical</b> <b>sockets</b> and nearby laptop computers. Bed bugs may also nest near animals that have nested within a dwelling, such as bats, birds, or rodents. They are also capable of surviving on domestic cats and dogs, though humans are the preferred host of C. lectularius.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>sockets</b> {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide three electrical {{connections to the}} supply conductors. These are termed neutral, line and earth. [...] Both neutral and line carry current and are defined as live parts. Neutral is usually at or very near to earth potential, being earthed either at the substation or at the service entrance (neutral-to-earth bonding is not permitted in the distribution board/consumer unit). Line (commonly, but technically incorrectly, called live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral. The [...] protective earth connection allows the exposed metal parts of the appliance {{to be connected to}} earth, providing protection to the user should those exposed parts inadvertently come into contact with any live parts within the appliance. [...] Historically, two-pin sockets without earth were used in Britain, but their use is now restricted to sockets specifically designated for shavers and toothbrushes.|$|R
50|$|Electrical appliances, such as lights, heaters, {{and heated}} towel rails, {{generally}} {{need to be}} installed as fixtures, with permanent connections rather than plugs and sockets. This minimizes the risk of electric shock. Ground-fault circuit interrupter <b>electrical</b> <b>sockets</b> can {{reduce the risk of}} electric shock, and are required for bathroom <b>socket</b> installation by <b>electrical</b> and building codes in the United States and Canada. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, only special sockets suitable for electric shavers and electric toothbrushes are permitted in bathrooms, and are labelled as such. UK building regulations also define what type of electrical fixtures, such as light fittings (i.e. how water-/splash-proof) may be installed in the areas (zones) around and above baths, and showers. Contrary to some information provided with bathroom light fittings, sinks and basins do not affect bathroom zones, as a bathroom is solely defined as a room containing a bath or shower, by wiring regulations. It is nevertheless good practice to avoid installing unsuitable fixtures close to sinks, as damage from water splashes may occur.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{technique}} of inductive contactless energy transfer (CET) has found its application in specific industrial applications where an (air) gap between energy source and load is preferable or even required. A relative new application area of CET is where CET {{is part of}} a general energy distribution network. As an example, <b>electrical</b> <b>sockets</b> might give problems in bathrooms for safety reasons: CET provides a solution because of inherent electrical isolation between source (grid) and loads (e. g. hair dryer or electrical shaver). For such application this paper reports on the design of a contactless power system that is able to supply to multiple users simultaneously, analogously to the regular plug-and-socket network. The proposed contactless system consists of a special energy supply cable where clamps (each maximum 240 W) can be mounted on at arbitrary locations along the cable while electrical isolation is maintained between cable and clamps. Result is a supply cable design and a prototype with 2 clamps, which are compared by means of analytical calculations, simulations and experimental results.
