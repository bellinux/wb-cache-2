30|$|Java Instrumentation Java Instrumentation (or {{bytecode}} rewriting) techniques generally undergo {{three steps}} as disassembling, modifying assembly code, and reassembling [16, 17, 19]. They make {{modifications to the}} intermediate assembly code files (like smali [20]) generated by <b>disassembling</b> <b>tools</b> (like apktool [21]) and reassemble the modified code into a new dex file. In Sensor Guardian, we do not rely on these <b>disassembling</b> <b>tools.</b> Instead, we modify and use the Dalvik bytecode library dexlib 2 [22] to directly instrument Android apps at Dalvik bytecode level. The modification to dexlib 2 mainly addresses the problem that some internal data structures in dexlib 2 cannot be directly converted to raw Dalvik bytecode. Compared to prior static instrumentation techniques, our Instrumentor {{does not need to}} generate intermediate assembly code files, which saves both time and space during instrumentation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{process of}} reverse {{engineering}} allows attackers {{to understand the}} behavior of software and extract proprietary algorithms and data structures (e. g. cryptographic keys) from it. Code obfuscation is frequently employed to mitigate this risk. However, while most of today’s obfuscation methods are targeted against static reverse engineering, where the attacker analyzes the code without actually executing it, they are still insecure against dynamic analysis techniques, where {{the behavior of the}} software is inspected at runtime. In this paper, we introduce a novel code obfuscation scheme that applies the concept of software diversification to the control flow graph of the software to enhance its complexity. Our approach aims at making dynamic reverse engineering considerably harder as the information an attacker can retrieve from the analysis of a single run of the program with a certain input, is useless for understanding the program behavior on other inputs. Based on a prototype implementation we show that our approach improves resistance against both static <b>disassembling</b> <b>tools</b> and dynamic reverse engineering at a reasonable performance penalty...|$|R

30|$|Static {{instrumentation}} on Android Static instrumentation on Android apps can {{be divided}} into two categories as Java and Native Instrumentation. Java Instrumentation is also called bytecode rewriting, which instruments on apps’ Dalvik bytecode. It uses static analysis to identify sensitive API calls and modifies the APK file to hook these calls. Jeon et al. [17] uses bytecode rewriting to enforce finer-grained permissions as an improvement to Android’s coarse-grained permission system. RetroSkeleton [16] is a rewriting framework for customizing Android apps’ behaviors, which supports several policies. These bytecode rewriting techniques do not handle native code in Android apps. Differently, Sensor Guardian does not only rewrite bytecode but also instruments native code. Another difference is that Sensor Guardian does not rely on <b>disassembling</b> <b>tools,</b> instead it directly instrument at Dalvik bytecode level. Hao et al. [19] systematically evaluates the effectiveness of API-level access control using bytecode rewriting and gives recommendations on engineering secure bytecode rewriting tools. In Sensor Guardian, we try to overcome some weaknesses mentioned in that work, for example, we hook reflection APIs and prevent apps from accessing system service directly. When instrumenting native code, Sensor Guardian employs the method in Aurasium [18]. Aurasium monitors and controls apps’ attempts to access sensitive information and system resources by hooking low-level system APIs {{at the start of the}} app. Differently, Sensor Guardian hooks high-level APIs each time a new library is loaded.|$|R

40|$|Spatiotemporal {{processes}} exist {{widely in}} manufacturing, such as tool surface degradation in ultrasonic metal welding and surface shape progression in high-precision machining. High-resolution characterization and monitoring of spatiotemporal processes are crucial for manufacturing process control. The rapid development of 3 D sensing technologies {{has made it}} possible to generate large volumes of spatiotemporal data for process characterization and monitoring. However, critical challenges exist in effectively acquiring and utilizing such spatiotemporal data in manufacturing, e. g., a high cost in the acquisition of high-resolution spatiotemporal data and a lack of systematic approaches for modeling multi-source data and monitoring spatiotemporal processes. To address these challenges, this dissertation carries out three research tasks for the development of collecting, modeling and monitoring spatiotemporal data. Specifically, (1) A novel dynamic sampling design algorithm is developed to efficiently characterize spatiotemporal processes in manufacturing. A state-space model and Kalman filter are used to predictively determine the measurement locations using a criterion considering both the prediction variance and the measurement costs. The determination of measurement locations is formulated as a binary integer programming problem, and genetic algorithm is applied for searching the optimal design. In addition, a new test statistic is proposed to monitor and update the temporal transition parameters in the spatiotemporal model. (2) A new surface modeling approach is devised to cost-effectively assess spatial surface variations by integrating an engineering model with multi-task Gaussian process (GP) learning. Surface variation is decomposed into a global trend which is induced by process variables and a zero-mean GP which shares commonality among multiple similar-but-not-identical processes. An iterative algorithm is developed to simultaneously estimate the process-specific parameters and the GP parameters. (3) A tool condition characterization and monitoring framework is developed for ultrasonic metal welding in lithium-ion battery manufacturing. The geometric progression of the tool surfaces is characterized using high-resolution spatiotemporal data. Classification algorithms are developed with monitoring features extracted from both the space and frequency domains. A novel impression measurement method is designed to effectively measure tool surfaces without the need of <b>disassembling</b> <b>tools</b> for off-line measurement...|$|R

50|$|The {{hospital}} {{was equipped with}} Deployable Medical System (DEPMEDS) equipment, which could be set up in various configurations. The major components of a combat support hospital were the expandable tactical shelters, TEMPER Tents, and the military vans. The expandable tactical shelter was a rigid paneled metal unit that could be unfolded to become an enclosed air conditioned shelter for use as an operating room, central material services, pharmacy, laboratory, blood bank, radiology, or biomedical maintenance. The TEMPER (Tent Extendible Modular Personnel) tent featured an aluminum frame and fabric outer skin, which could be quickly assembled and <b>disassembled</b> without, <b>tools.</b> The standard ward was 20 feet by 64 feet, consisting of 8 8-by-20 foot TEMPER sections. The MILVAN was a rigid paneled metal storage and transportation container, which was allocated to the functional sections of the hospital. When operational, the combat support hospital could provide climate and environmental control equivalent to that found in any fixed hospital.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{augmented}} reality system for automotive engineering education is introduced. Main {{objective of the}} system is teaching disassemble/assemble procedure of automatic transmission of a vehicle to students, who study automotive engineering. System includes vehicle transmission, set of tools and mechanical facilities, two video cameras, computer with developed software, HMD glasses and two LCD screens. Developed software gives instructions on assembling and disassembling processes of real vehicle transmission with the help of augmenting virtual reality objects on the video stream. Overlaying of 3 D instructions on the technological workspace can be used as an interactive educational material. In disassembling process, mechanical parts which should be disassembled are augmented on video stream from video cameras. Same is done for assembling process. Animation and other visual effects are applied for better indication of the current assembling/disassembling instruction. During learning and training, student can see what parts of vehicle transmission and in which order should be assembled or <b>disassembled.</b> Required <b>tools</b> and technological operations are displayed to a student with the help of {{augmented reality}}, as well. As a result, the system guides a student step-by-step through an assembly/disassembly sequence. During educational process a student has an opportunity to return back to any previous instruction if it is necessary.

40|$|New {{opportunities}} emerge when {{mixed reality}} environments are augmented with wide {{field of view}} displays and full body, realtime tracking. Such systems will allow users see a correctly tracked representation of themselves in the virtual environment, and allow users to “share space ” with other virtual humans in the virtual environment. Furthermore, such systems {{will be able to}} use tracking data to identify opportunities when a user’s perception of the environment can be altered. This would be helpful in situations where redirection or reorientation of the user might be done to “stretch space, ” i. e. imperceptibly rotating the environment around the user, so that a straight-line walk becomes a curve, preventing the user from ever encountering walls in the physical space. We believe that allowing users to co-inhabit virtual spaces with virtual humans and decoupling physical size constraints from these virtual spaces are two important building blocks for effective mixed reality training experiences. immersive technologies and techniques to build mixed reality environments in support of these applications. Mixed reality is a term that describes environments and experiences that combine elements that are real with elements that are virtual. For example, a user could be immersed in a virtual reality system displaying a virtual automobile engine model which can be <b>disassembled</b> with real <b>tools.</b> Other mixed reality experiences might be provided by physical rooms where windows are simulated by display screens, or by head mounted displays (HMDs) which use cameras and graphics engines to overlay virtual objects over a view of the real world...|$|R
