25|$|An {{audiobook}} {{version was}} released by Margaritaville Records and Island Records in 1996, on the 25th anniversary of the book's original publication.

The close proximity of Greezed Lightnin's first runout spike to the stage often resulted in that ride being closed during performances to minimize noise.|$|E

Besides Stern, Sirius has reached deals with domestic diva Martha Stewart, E Street Band member Steven Van Zandt (aka Little Steven), <b>Jimmy</b> <b>Buffett,</b> and Eminem to executive-produce streams or entire channels on Sirius.
