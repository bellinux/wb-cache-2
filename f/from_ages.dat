5|$|Following {{the example}} of several of his stage colleagues, Gielgud joined tours of {{military}} camps. He gave recitals of prose and poetry, and acted in a triple bill of short plays, including two from Coward's , but he found at first that less highbrow performers like Beatrice Lillie were better than he at entertaining the troops. He returned to filming in 1940, as Disraeli in Thorold Dickinson's The Prime Minister. In this morale-boosting film he portrayed the politician <b>from</b> <b>ages</b> thirty to seventy; this was, in Morley's view, {{the first time he}} seemed at home before the camera. Gielgud made no more films for the next ten years; he turned down the role of Julius Caesar in the 1945 film of Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra with Vivien Leigh. He and Leigh were close friends, and Shaw tried hard to persuade him to play the part, but Gielgud had taken a strong dislike to the director, Gabriel Pascal. Caesar was eventually played by Gielgud's former teacher, Claude Rains.|$|E

40|$|Background: Hypoxic {{preconditioning}} of {{bone marrow}} cells (BMCs) from young healthy individuals {{can enhance the}} cells' therapeutic potential. Considering that the response to hypoxia may differ according {{to the quality of}} the cells, we assessed the effect of hypoxic preconditioning on BMCs <b>from</b> <b>aged</b> mice and compared the difference in response between BMCs <b>from</b> <b>aged</b> and young mice. Methods and Results: BMCs from young (3 months) and aged (20 - 22 months) mice were subjected to hypoxic preconditioning by culture for 24 h in 2 % O 2. Compared with BMCs from young mice, those <b>from</b> <b>aged</b> mice showed significantly fewer CD 34 - or c-kit-positive stem cells, higher expression of p 53, and lower telomerase activity. Adhesion, survival and angiogenic potency were also lower in BMCs <b>from</b> <b>aged</b> mice, indicating an aging-related impairment. Hypoxia-preconditioned BMCs <b>from</b> <b>aged</b> mice showed enhanced adhesion, survival, and angiogenic potency with the in vitro assessments, as well as the in vivo implantation into ischemic hindlimbs. All the enhancements by hypoxic preconditioning were comparable between BMCs <b>from</b> <b>aged</b> and young mice, although the angiogenic potential of BMCs with and without hypoxic preconditioning was lower in old mice compared with young mice. Conclusions: Similar responses to hypoxia by BMCs <b>from</b> both <b>aged</b> and young mice suggest that hypoxic preconditioning could be a useful method of enhancing the angiogenic potential of BMCs...|$|R
