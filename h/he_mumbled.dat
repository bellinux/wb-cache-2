2500|$|Several young {{actors were}} seen and read {{for the part}} of Mark (including Gary Hailes, who would later play the gay barrow boy, Barry Clark). On paper, David Scarboro was {{the least likely to}} get the job as he was {{relatively}} inexperienced, having previously only appeared in a little-known made-for-television film and Grange Hill. His reading was not a huge success as <b>he</b> <b>mumbled</b> most of his lines. However, Holland and Smith were taken with his appearance, particularly his [...] "piercing eyes", which reminded them of James Dean. They felt that he would be [...] "dynamite on-screen", and his likeness to their vision of the character was uncanny, so they offered him the role.|$|E
2500|$|Beuys's {{first solo}} {{exhibition}} {{in a private}} gallery opened on 26 November 1965 {{with one of the}} artist's most famous and compelling performances: How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare. The artist could be viewed through the glass of the gallery's window. His face was covered in honey and gold leaf, an iron slab was attached to his boot. In his arms he cradled a dead hare, into whose ear <b>he</b> <b>mumbled</b> muffled noises as well as explanations of the drawings that lined the walls. Such materials and actions had specific symbolic value for Beuys. For example, honey is the product of bees, and for Beuys (following Rudolf Steiner), bees represented an ideal society of warmth and brotherhood. Gold had its importance within alchemical enquiry, and iron, the metal of Mars, stood for a masculine principle of strength and connection to the earth. A photograph from the performance, in which Beuys is sitting with the hare, has been described [...] "by some critics as a new Mona Lisa of the 20th century," [...] though Beuys disagreed with the description.|$|E
2500|$|According to the investigations, Oswald hid {{and covered}} the rifle with boxes after the attack and descended through the rear stairwell. About 90 seconds after the shots rang out, Oswald {{encountered}} police officer Marrion L. Baker, who had his gun drawn, [...] in the second-floor lunchroom. The patrolman was accompanied by Oswald's supervisor, Roy Truly. Baker let Oswald pass after Truly identified him as an employee. According to Baker, Oswald {{did not appear to}} be [...] "nervous" [...] or [...] "out of breath." [...] Truly said that Oswald look [...] "startled" [...] when Baker pointed his gun directly at him. Mrs. Robert Reid—a clerical supervisor at the depository who returned to her office within two minutes after the shooting—said that she saw Oswald [...] "was very calm" [...] on the second floor with a coke in his hands. As they walked past each other, Mrs. Reid said to Oswald, [...] "The President has been shot" [...] to which <b>he</b> <b>mumbled</b> something in response, but Reid did not understand him. Oswald was believed to have left the depository through the front entrance just before police sealed it off. Truly later pointed out to officers that Oswald was the only employee that he was certain was missing.|$|E
