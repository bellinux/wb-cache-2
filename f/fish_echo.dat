40|$|The in situ {{measurement}} of target strength (TS) depends on exactly one fish being within the sampled volume. This {{is more likely to}} occur the nearer the transducer is to the fish targets. The detection rate can be improved by lowering the transducer on a cable from a stationary vessel, so decreasing the range to the observed fish. In this application, a standard sphere is commonly suspended below the transducer to provide the real-time calibration of the received signals. However, forward scattering by the sphere distorts the trans-mitted pulse, and equally the returning fish echoes, causing a bias in the estimated TS. Further, for a split-beam transducer, forward-scattering of the <b>fish</b> <b>echo</b> by the sphere modifies the phase differences observed between the transducer segments. This changes the apparent distribution of targets, but not the estimated TS. The biases are not large, those considered being within + 0. 9 dB, and they depend on the sonar frequency, the target range, and the direction. The theory of these effects is examined, and formulae are provided for correcting the observed <b>fish</b> <b>echo</b> to that which would be received in free-field conditions, i. e. with the sphere removed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Estimating mean fish density {{per unit}} area {{has been done by}} {{counting}} single <b>fish</b> <b>echo</b> traces with a split beam echo sounder system in the open sea. A data program has been written that scans the acoustic signals for echo peaks and classify these into echo traces. The program counts the number of echo traces from fish that cross the beam within given distances from the acoustic axis over a known sailing distance, and gives an absolute estimate of fish density. This is ob-tained by using the off acoustic axis angles of fish that generate resolved echoes to compute the athwartship distance from the vertical acoustic axis to the fish. The program is described and demonstrated on selected files of raw data recorded by the SIMRAD EK 60 split beam system. Estimated fish densities for these files are also obtained by the echo integration method, and the echo trace method gives estimates that agree well with these estimates under sufficiently “good condi-tions”...|$|E

The towed system contains broadband acoustic channels collectively spanning the frequency range 1. 7 – 100 kHz, with some gaps. Using a pulse-compression technique, the range {{resolution of the}} echoes is ∼ 20 and 3 cm in the lower and upper ranges of the frequencies, respectively, allowing high-resolution imaging of patches and resolving fish near the seafloor. Measuring the swimbladder resonance at the lower frequencies eliminates major ambiguities normally associated with the interpretation of <b>fish</b> <b>echo</b> data: (i) the resonance frequency {{can be used to}} estimate the volume of the swimbladder (inferring the size of fish), and (ii) signals at the lower frequencies do not depend strongly on the orientation of the fish. At-sea studies of Atlantic herring demonstrate the potential for routine measurements of fish size and density, with significant improvements in accuracy over traditional high-frequency narrowband echosounders. The system also detected patches of scatterers, presumably zooplankton, at the higher frequencies.

We measured the tilt angle of Japanese sandeels (Ammodytes personatus Girard) in a water tank, and calculated the acoustic target strength (TS) using a theoretical scattering model. This study examined the TS of sandeels from the northern coast of Hokkaido, which have a larger body size than those in other regions in Japan. TS values for sandeels, a swimbladderless fish, were estimated using a distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) model at two frequencies: 38 and 120 kHz. The mean tilt angle was 20. 4 ?? (S. D. = 18. 5 ??), which differed slightly {{from that of the}} lesser sandeel, Ammodytes marinus. The regression equations of the average TS values were TS 38 kHz = 8. 2 log 10 SL ??? 74. 2 and TS 120 kHz = 20. 9 log 10 SL ??? 92. 6, respectively. At 120 kHz, the slope was close to 20, suggesting that the acoustic backscattering strength was proportional to the square of the body length. This value was smaller at 38 kHz, suggesting that the acoustic backscattering strength was stable to differences in body length. We obtained a small discrepancy for both frequencies (??TS = TS 120 kHz???TS 38 kHz) were TS 120 kHz < TS 38 kHz. Discrepancies of ??? 1. 3 dB for the maximum TS, and ??? 1. 8 dB for averaged TS were found in 72 fish samples, which would be useful for identifying sandeel schools in practical analysis using TS differences...|$|E

It {{is based on an}} analysis of several data sets obtained during JWACS 2002, a research expedition in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas in 2002. Data were collected by a variety of means: the ship‘s Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) —a 30 -day record; a bongo net that collected plankton and larval fishes; a portable <b>fish</b> <b>echo</b> sounder operated prior to net sampling operations; the ship‘s hydrological profiling system (CTD/rosette); and a CTD-type data logger mounted on the bongo net. Data visualization techniques were used to explore and analyze data and to report results. Data synthesis consists of an evaluation of fish distribution in relation to the physico-chemical and bathymetric characteristics of their habitat. An extensive warm-water plume of Alaska Coastal Current water with phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish (presumably) was found reaching perhaps 300 km eastward from Barrow Canyon into western Beaufort Sea. ADCP backscatter from the plume was the highest of the study, indicating dense aggregations of biomass, perhaps mixed with marine snow. Only larval fish were found in the upper portion of the water column in the Chukchi Sea but Arctic cod of all age classes (i. e., larvae to adult) were in the upper 20 m at the northeastern Chukchi Sea shelf break and along the Alaskan and Mackenzie Shelf in the warm surface layer (2 - 5 o C). Shoals of fish were detected at the shelf break in eastern Chukchi Sea and along the Alaskan coast and the Mackenzie Shelf. Much larger shoals were detected in deeper waters along the continental slope (250 - 350 m) in the latter two areas, and at the bottom of Barrow and Mackenzie canyons. Fish were in Atlantic Water where temperatures were above 0 o C. Few fish were found in colder water between the surface layer and Atlantic Water.

40|$|A {{means of}} {{assessing}} {{the quantity of}} exploitable fish in the sea is a requirement for effective management of the resource. Sonar is widely used in this regard, as it provides a rapid means of assessment. Two acoustic assessment techniques currently used are the echo counting and echo integration· methods. The echo counting method requires that only single <b>fish</b> <b>echoes</b> {{are present in the}} backscatter from the shoal, while the echo integration technique requires an a-priori knowledge of the average target strength of the fish in the shoal. A novel method of assessment has been proposed. It relies on the relationship between the statistics of the backscatter from a volume distribution of scatterers and the number of scatterers contributing to the backscatter at any one time. The attraction of the method when applied to the estimation of number density of fish, is that estimates can be produced in the presence of overlapping echoes, and that knowledge of the target strength of the fish is unnecessary. The application of this method to acoustic fish stock assessment is investigated in this work. Current methods of assessment are reviewed and the theory of the statistical method is given. A computer simulation of the scattering problem gives a useful insight into the effects of sample size and density on the accuracy of the method. The method has been applied to the assessment of fish at sea, where it was run in tandem with an echo integrator. The results obtained with the two techniques are compared.

40|$|Fish {{aggregating}} devices (FADs) {{are widely}} used by purse seiners in the tropical tuna fisheries. Many species of fish including juvenile tuna often associate with these FADS. There are global decline in tuna catch largely owing to the mortality of juvenile tuna often caught as bycatch. Therefore a direct method for sizing the fish prior to catching will be valuable information to mitigate juvenile fish mortality. Target strength is an indicator for how large the target is, as it {{is determined by the}} acoustic reflectivity of the fish. If the target possesses a swimbladder, it accounts for more than 90 % of the echo energy of the target. This work sought to demonstrate the data collection capacity of simple echo sounders that can run on low power supply, and subsequently can be operated on batteries {{for an extended period of}} time. Acoustic data were collected using the SIMRAD ES 10 single beam echo sounder at 200 KHz and SIMRAD EK 60 split beam echo sounder.

This is specific to a specie and frequency and has been estimated for many species at different frequencies. Therefore, using the TS - length of fish relationship, TS = 20 * log 10 (L) - 68, the lengths of fish were estimated. A way to transfer this information to the user in a reduced format is also discussed.

This thesis aims to explore some of these gaps by covering a mixture of topics. Using multifrequency hydroacoustics we explored the possibility to separate mysids from <b>fish</b> <b>echoes</b> and successfully established a promising and effective method for obtaining mysid abundance/biomass estimates (paper I). An investigation of the current mysid community in a coastal area of the northern Baltic proper (paper II) demonstrated that the formerly dominant, pelagic mysid Mysis mixta had decreased substantially (~ 50 %) in favor for phytoplanktivorous, juvenile Neomysis integer and Mysis relicta sp. By examining different aspects of mysid behavior, we studied the vertical size distribution of mysids in the field and found that size increased with depth/declining light, irrespective of temperature; indicating that their vertical size distribution primarily is a response to predation (paper II). In paper III, a combination of ecological and genetic markers was used to investigate intraspecific differences in migratory tendency. Both marker types indicated that some part of the Mysis salemaai population is sedentary on the bottom and that this strategy is a phenotypically plastic but persistent trait, analogous to the partial migrations seen in many birds and fishes. In paper IV a temperature and weight specific respiration model was developed for the littoral Praunus flexuosus. Routine respiration was moreover elevated by post-prandial effects (specific dynamic action) for longer times than previously suggested.

40|$|Systematic use of {{echo sounder}} in {{fisheries}} and marine science comrnenced in the 1930 's and developed rapidly after World War II. During the 1950 's and 1960 's large scale echo surveys {{were carried out}} in many regions as a service to fishing fleets and resulting in {{a substantial increase in}} knowledge of distribution and migration for many species and stocks. Already in 1958 - 1968 Russian scientists provided estimates of abundance of Norwegian spring spawning herring based on acoustic surveying and underwater photography. Acoustic instruments in use in fisheries and plankton research span a frequency range from about 1 kilohertz (kHz) to several megahertz (MHz). At 1 kHz typical ranges and sampling volumes are tens of kilometers and thousands of cubic meters while the corresponding figures at some MHZ are ranges of a few meters and sampling volumes of less than a cubic centimeter. The <b>echo</b> ability of <b>fish</b> and plankton varies considerably between species and for groups of species as well as between acoustic frequencies depending on the material properties and shape and size of targets and particularly on whether or not the organisms contain gas (swim bladders). Integration of echo energy is the most widely used acoustic method for estimating densities and abundance of fish. The basis for the method is the linearity principle, i. e. that the accumulated echo energy per unit volume or area from an aggregation is proportional to actual fish density; the factor of proportionality being the average echo ability (scattering cross section) of the individual <b>fishes.</b> <b>Echo</b> integration was introduced in the early 1960 's, and the linearity principle was verified by measurements of live fish in the early 1980 's.

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of echoes collected by active remote-sensing systems, such as sonar and radar, is often ambiguous {{due to the}} complexities in the scattering processes involving the scatterers, the environment, and the sensing system. This thesis addresses this challenge {{using a combination of}} laboratory and field experiments, theoretical modeling, and numerical simulations in the context of acoustic scattering by marine organisms. The unifying themes of the thesis are 1) quantitative characterization of the spectral, temporal, and statistical features derived from echoes collected using both broadband and narrowband signals, and 2) the {{interpretation of}} echoes by establishing explicit links between echo features and the sources of scattering through physics principles. This physics-based approach is distinct from the subjective descriptions and empirical methods employed in most conventional fisheries acoustic studies. The first part focuses on understanding the dominant backscattering mechanisms of live squid as a function of orientation. The study provides the first broadband backscattering laboratory data set from live squid at all angles of orientation, and conclusively confirms the fluid-like, weakly-scattering material properties of squid through a series of detailed comparisons between data and predictions given by models derived based on the distorted-wave Born approximation. In the second part, an exact analytical narrowband model and a numerical broadband model are developed based on physics principles to describe the probability density function of the amplitudes of echo envelopes (echo pdf) of arbitrary aggregations of scatterers. The narrowband echo pdf model significantly outperforms the conventional mixture models in analyzing simulated mixed assemblages. When applied to analyze <b>fish</b> <b>echoes</b> collected in the ocean, the numerical density of fish estimated using the broadband echo pdf model is comparable to the density estimated using echo integration methods. These results demonstrate the power of the physics-based approach and give a first-order assessment of the performance of echo statistics methods in echo interpretation.

Some basic experiments to observe the echo shapes and periodic changes in scattering patterns are described in Chapter 2. The results of these experiments are explained theoretically in Chapter 3. A period of changes in a scattering pattern can be applied to estimate the distance between two acoustic sources. In Chapter 4, an experiment with two steel balls, the distance between two acoustic sources was calculated from the periodic change of the scattering pattern by using an auto-correlation function. It was confirmed that the period of the carrier changed appreciably when the echo amplitude was cancelled due to interference. This phenomenon will be used to indicate a state of interference on wave form fluctuation. ""In experiments with eight species individual <b>fishes,</b> the <b>echo</b> pattern showed a periodic change which was estimated to be caused by interference. Also the period of the carrier fluctuated in the cancelled condition. In Chapter 5, the results of these measurements are described. The Spectrum of scattering patterns from individual fishes are analyzed in order to clarify the cause of periodic changes in dorsal aspect scattering patterns. Three species into target fishes were measured in three states, whole, without bladder, and skeleton. The power spectrum was calculated from scattering patterns which transformed to distance-amplitude coordinates from incidence angle-amplitude coordinates. The elemental patterns and power proportion of each frequency band were calculated by using convolution integration of the power spectrum and filter-function in the frequency region. Analysis shows that a relationship was observed between fish species, or fish figure, and the characteristics of the changing period. Chapter 6 contains a summary of this research and discussion about an application of information included in echo shape. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{split-beam}} technique {{makes it}} possible to determine the precise location of a fish in the acoustic beam. This is a very useful feature, as it permits behavioural observations to be conducted without disturbing the <b>fish.</b> A split-beam <b>echo</b> sounder (Simrad ES 400) interfaced with a computer has been used to track fish swimming through the acoustic beam. Tracks of reference targets guided through the beam of split-beam transducers on three research vessels and the transducer used for fish-behaviour experiments are presented with associated beam patterns. A "belt-fit" equation was used to represent the beam pattern measured in the tracking experiment. This was used to correct signal amplitudes for transducer directivity. In situ target-strength functions, representing the fish directivity pattern in the dorsal aspect, and three-dimensional plots of fish movement through the acoustic beam, are presented for three different gadoids...|$|R
