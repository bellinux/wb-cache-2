50|$|RawSHAKE is {{the basis}} for the Sakura coding for tree hashing, which has not been {{standardized}} yet. However, the SHAKE suffix has been carefully chosen so that it is forward compatible with Sakura. Sakura appends 0 for a chaining hop or 1 for a message, then 10*0 for a non-final (inner) node or 1 for a final node, before it applies RawSHAKE. Sequential hashing corresponds to a hop tree with a single message node, which means that 11 is appended to the message before RawSHAKE is applied. Thus, the SHAKE XOFs append 1111 to the message, ie., 1 for message, 1 for final node, and 11 for the RawSHAKE <b>domain</b> separation <b>suffix.</b>|$|R

40|$|Turkish vowel harmony is very systematic, {{but in a}} little-studied {{class of}} words, appears to break down. I propose that this {{apparent}} harmony failure is actually covert harmony, or exceptional transparency. 	Background: The backness of vowels in Turkish suffixes {{is determined by the}} backness of the nearest vowel in the word they attach to (1). (1) Nom. 		Dative		Gloss a. 	kadran	→	kadran-a, 	*kadran-e	'clockface' b. 	beden	→	beden-e, 	*beden-a	'body'Harmony within roots is often violated, but harmony between suffixes and the nearest root vowel is extremely robust (2). Nonetheless, in certain roots, /a/ exceptionally behaves as transparent and suffixes must surface with front vowels (3). (2) 	Singular		Plural		Gloss a. 	kitap	→	kitap-lar,	*kitap-ler	'book' b. 	kahve	→	kahve-ler,	*kahve-lar	'coffee'(3) 					 a. 	harf	→ 	harf-ler,	*harf-lar	'letters' b. 	dikkat	→ 	dikkat-ler,	*dikkat-lar	'attentions'To account for this exceptional transparency, I extend Smolensky's (2006) headed feature domains theory, and propose that the input to phonology contains headless feature domains. 	Proposal: Existing theories of vowel harmony require a segmental harmony trigger. But harf contains no [-back] segment to head a front feature domain and select front suffixes, so harf-ler remains unexplainable. Extending Smolensky (2006), I propose that all features are feature domains, which replace traditional segmental feature specifications. 	In Turkish, backness domains normally coincide with roots. Alternating suffixes lack their own backness domains and merge into the stem's domain. Exceptional transparency is driven by faithfulness considerations: the root as a whole is a front domain, but it contains /a/ in an embedded back <b>domain.</b> <b>Suffixes</b> are incorporated into the outermost backness domain as usual, resulting in transparency. (4) (dik(ka) bt) f) + lEr → (dik(ka) btler) f) 	Since vowels must realize the backness of their containing domains, high- and mid- vowels cannot occur in conflicting embedded domains. However, as a low vowel, /a/ is more central than the other back vowels, and unlike the other Turkish back vowels, it lacks an exactly height-matched front counterpart phoneme. Perceptual reasons, then, lead the Turkish constraint-ranking to allow only /a/ as an exceptionally transparent vowel. The feature-as-domain analysis of vowel harmony models the selection of front suffixes by harf and dikkat without the need to posit phonetically unrealized front features on consonants, or any other additional apparatus...|$|R
40|$|According to Daijirin Dictionary, dasu {{is a basic}} Japanese verb {{that has}} 28 {{different}} meanings. This poly-semantic verb represents ‘put out’, ‘send’, ‘submit’, ‘publish’, ‘produce’ and ‘start’, etc. This paper explains semantic structure of dasu by cognitive semantic approach, especially image schema, and compares it with that of its Korean counterpart naida. This paper identifies the common elements and {{differences between the two}} verbs. As the common elements; (1) both verbs mean ‘move out’ prototypically; (2) the prototypical meaning extends to more abstract concepts and social domains via container image schema; and (3) both verbs represent aspect as compound verb suffix by semantic bleaching. However, there are also differences. (1) naida has more strong meaning of movement from the area of subject to outside and has broad meaning potential in abstract <b>domain.</b> (2) As <b>suffix,</b> naida represents accomplishment while dasu beginning because naida takes inner view point while dasu outer view point. These differences might be related to those of the original meaning potential of the two verbs and syntax differen ce in Japanese and Korean. ...|$|R
40|$|Suffix tree is an {{important}} data structure for indexing a long sequence (like a genome sequence) or a concatenation of sequences. It finds many applications in practice, especially in the <b>domain</b> of bioinformatics. <b>Suffix</b> tree allows for efficient pattern search with time independent of the sequence length. However, the performance of disk-based suffix tree is a concern as it is slowed down significantly by poor localized access resulting in high IO disk access. The focus {{of this paper is}} to design an IO-efficient and Compact Partitioned Suffix tree representation (CPS-tree) on disk. We show that representing suffix tree using CPStree has several advantages. First, our representation allows us to visit any node in the suffix tree by accessing at most log n pages of the tree where n is the length of the sequence. Second, our storage scheme improves the access pattern and reduces the number of page fault resulting in efficient search retrieval and efficient tree traversal operations. Third, by bit packing, our index is compact. Experimental results show that CPS-tree outperforms other indexes on disk. When fully loaded into the main memory, CPS-tree is still efficient. Hence, we expect CPS-tree to be a good disk-based representation of suffix tree, with potential use in practical applications. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a constraint-based approach for the stress assignment in Auca, an Indian language spoken in Ecuador. The {{goal is to}} integrate syllables into higher prosodic categories such as foot, and to demonstrate that both syllables and feet play crucial parts in stress assignment. Based on Hayes’s analysis (Hayes 1995), the foot type of Auca is syllabic trochee. In describing the Auca stress pattern, {{it is useful to}} treat a morphologically complex word as consisting of a stem plus a suffix. Within the stem domain, there is stress on odd-numbered syllables, counting from left-to-right. Within the <b>suffix</b> <b>domain,</b> there is stress on the penult and every other syllable before it, from right to left. In addition, the main stress falls on the rightmost stressed syllable in the stem [1]-[3]. To account for [1]-[3], it seems sufficient to assign stress based on the syllabic trochee foot template, either left-to-right or right-to-left. However, problems arise when the stem and the suffix trains collide {{in the middle of a}} word, as [4]-[5] show. In [4], clashing stresses straddle the morpheme boundary. In [5], clashing stresses occur before the boundary. In addition, the main stress falls on the rightmost stressed syllable of the stem in [4], but falls on the penultimate stressed syllable of the stem in [5]. Because of the adjustments of stress taking place in [4] and [5], Hayes posits a two-layered, bidirectional analysis to account for the data, and allows restructuring of foo...|$|R
