2500|$|Bookchin's {{second major}} {{criticism}} is that deep ecology fails to link environmental crises with authoritarianism and hierarchy. Social ecologists like him believe that environmental problems are firmly {{rooted in the}} manner of human social interaction, and suggest that deep ecologists fail to recognise the potential for human beings to solve environmental issues through a change of cultural attitudes. According to Bookchin, it is a social reconstruction alone that [...] "can spare the biosphere from virtual destruction." [...] Though some deep ecologists may reject the argument that ecological behavior is rooted in the social paradigm (which, according to their view, would be an anthropocentric fallacy), others in fact embrace this argument, such as the adherents to the deep <b>ecologist</b> <b>movement</b> Deep Green Resistance.|$|E

40|$|Infusing {{models for}} animal {{movement}} with more behavioral realism {{has been a}} goal of <b>movement</b> <b>ecologists</b> for several years. As ecologists have begun to collect more and more data on animal distribution and abundance, a clear need has arisen for more sophisticated analysis. Such analysis could include more realistic movement behavior, {{more information on the}} organism-environment interaction, and more ways to separate observation error from process error. Because landscape ecologists and behavioral ecologists typically study these same themes at very different scales, it has been proposed that their union could be productive for all (Lima and Zollner, 1996). By understanding how animals interact with their land- and seascapes, we can better understand how species partition up resources are large spatial scales. Accordingly I begin this dissertation with a large spatial scale analysis of distribution data for marine mammals from Nova Scotia through the Gulf of Mexico. I analyzed these data in three separate regions, and in the two data-rich regions, find compelling separation between the different communities. In the northernmost region, this separation is broadly along diet based partitions. This research provides a baseline for future study of marine mammal systems, and more importantly highlights several gaps in current data collections. In the last 6 years several <b>movement</b> <b>ecologists</b> have begun to imbue sophisticated statistical analyses with increasing amounts of movement behavior. This has changed the way <b>movement</b> <b>ecologists</b> think about <b>movement</b> data and movement processes. In this dissertation I focus my research on continuing this trend. I reviewed the state of movement modeling and then proposed a new Bayesian movement model that builds on three questions of: behavior; organism-environment interaction; and process-based inference with noisy data. Application of this model to two different datasets, migrating right whales in the NW Atlantic, and foraging monk seals in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands, provides for the first time estimates of how moving animals make choices about the suitability of patches within their perceptual range. By estimating parameters governing this suitability I provide right whale managers a clear depiction of the gaps in their protection in this vulnerable and understudied migratory corridor. For monk seals I provide a behaviorally based view into how animals in different colonies and age and sex groups move throughout their range. This information is crucial for managers who translocate individuals to new habitat as it provides them a quantitative glimpse of how members of certain groups perceive their landscape. This model provides critical information about the behaviorally based movement choices animals make. Results can be used to understand the ecology of these patterns, and can be used to help inform conservation actions. Finally this modeling framework provides a way to unite fields of movement ecology and graph theory. Dissertatio...|$|R

40|$|We have {{witnessed}} the rise of <b>ecologist</b> <b>movements</b> since {{the second half of}} 20. Century when it is understood that t he mankind has exploited and polluted the world he/ she lives on as far as the world will be exterminated by the mankind. This rise has sometimes been concrete with the acts of an organization that is environmental protector; has come into existence with t he basic thesis of green parties that contains ecologist policies or {{has been one of the}} basic arguments of international politics. As a consequence of this, environmental awareness and protectionist approach have been mentioned from national policy docume nts and green party programs to international/ supranational agreements and acts of environmentalist activists in the academic studies in a broad framework. Moreover, a lot of ecological based philosophical trend like deep ecology, eco - socialism, eco - femin ism, etc. has emerged in this process. In the period in question, a sector has also adopted the environmental awareness as a subject; but this sector’s activities haven’t been mentioned so much in academic studies. Mentioned sector is cinema; in other wor ds, it is American and European based film industry. American based Holywood is the center that made the first production in this sense. Starting from 1970 ’s, lots of films have been begun to play under the main topic of disaster movie. European film indus try has started to use this theme as of 2000 ’s yet. First produced films were fictionalized via disaster scenarios which arise depending on a singular problem. In this frame, lots of factors like an earthquake, flood, a disease that a virus appears suddenl y creates were thought as the initiator of disaster. The solutions found for singular problem are usually the solutions found depending on the work of a person or a small group of professionals. In time, we can see that the themes change into global ecolog ical disasters which affect the world in general, dystopias or ecotopias in some films (like avatar). With reference to the basic thesis which is that the environmentalist approach in the sector of cinema improves appropriately to basic ecological paradigm s; this study aims to trace ecological approach in this sector.

O corpus é composto por textos cujo tema é o meio ambiente, enunciados por Exame, IstoÉ Dinheiro e Época Negócios de 2010, publicações que atuam como modalizadoras do leitor-executivo. O objetivo da pesquisa é compreender como o enunciador atua semioticamente para tamponar o furo no discurso liberal-capitalista deixado exposto pelas correntes antagonistas que disputam a hegemonia no campo discursivo ambientalista. Nossa tese é a de que esta operação promove uma inversão sintomal e, assim, no lugar mais fraco das redes de equivalência simbólica do discurso hegemônico o meio ambiente declarado em crise os enunciadores erigem como ponto nodal a sustentabilidade, seu avesso positivado. O sistema de produção e consumo é ressignificado a partir dessa inversão: de causador da crise ambiental no presente torna-se propiciador de um mundo verde e limpo no futuro. Quanto à metodologia de pesquisa, ela se baseia na análise discursiva pós-estruturalista de Laclau, Mouffe, i ek, Howarth e Stavrakakis; no diálogo com a corrente francesa da Análise de Discurso (AD), em autores como Maingueneau, Pêcheux e Ducrot; e na incorporação de elementos da filosofia política contemporânea proposta por Rancière, Agamben e Latour, entre outros.

The goal of this research is to understand how the enunciators semiotically act to plug the hole in the liberal-capitalist discourse, which was left exposed by the antagonists factions that struggle by hegemony on the environmentalist field. Our thesis points that this operation promotes a sintomal inversion and, thus, in the weaker point of the hegemonic discourse s symbolic equivalence net the environment declared in crisis the enunciators build as a nodal point the sustainability, this positivized reverse.

40|$|This PhD {{explains}} what makes that organization’s members behave enough {{as they are}} asked for so that the organization they belong to is able to work and continue to exist. For this purpose, {{it was necessary to}} understand the difference between individual and collective action. And to show that an organization means being able to behave collectively over time, and that collective behavior is characterized by the fact that individuals give out a part or all the resources they are controlling to achieve one or several more or less good defined goals. This common sharing of resources means a limitation of the latitude of actions {{of the members of the}} organization, because they give them out to act accordingly to expected communicated behavior. For that purpose, we have defined a model of engagement factors, as well as organizational types of influence, who allowed us to understand the different part of the problem we are addressing, and to test them. We have done this with two types of organizations who seems a priori to be very different. On the first hand the end production stage, the car assembly lines, of the Volkswagen factory in Wolfsburg, and on the second hand, the formal organization of a german association of the defense of the nature and wild life in Braunschweig, called BKBS (BUND Kreisgruppe Braunschweig), who belongs to the <b>ecologist</b> social <b>movement.</b> The formulated hypothesis attached to the different part of the problem we were addressing has been confirmed through our two empirical researches. In the car assembly lines, the expectations communicated to the production masters changed so that they behavior transform the organization and make out of it a more adapted one to the environment. In the formal organization of this social movement (SMO), we have measured a much less bigger opposition between his apparent functionality, to create a common good which belongs to everybody, and the egoistic reasons to participate to him. The engagement factors, and organizational types of influence, allow us to measure how strong the opposition between individual needs and collective behavior is, and to explain the different behavior of the production master and the participants of the BKBS. We have defined these factors as the emitter, the communication tools and the content of the asked behavior. The influence of the characteristics of the receptor of the asked behavior has been demonstrated as well. With the types of influence, we have demonstrated that this apparently different type of organization is using to a different degree what we have defined as manipulation, socialization, motivation, selection and control. It depends of their environment, goals and structure and forms a systemic relationship with their members and what and how they can ask them to do...|$|R
