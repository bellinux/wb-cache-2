5|$|Christian apologist and philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a {{supporter}} of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise of reliable reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God {{would be expected to}} create beings with reliable reasoning faculties, evolution would be <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> lead to unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true. This novel epistemological argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, {{is more likely to be}} selected for than irrationality, making the natural development of reliable cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{potential}} prey-predator relationship, {{the presence of}} predaceous dingoes {{does not appear to}} heavily influence emu numbers, with other natural conditions <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> cause mortality. Wedge-tailed eagles are the only avian predator capable of attacking fully-grown emus, though are perhaps most likely to take small or young specimens. The eagles attack emus by swooping downwards rapidly and at high speed and aiming for the head and neck. In this case, the emu's jumping technique as employed against the dingo is not useful. The birds try to target the emu in open ground so that it cannot hide behind obstacles. Under such circumstances, the emu can only run in a chaotic manner and change directions frequently to try and evade its attacker. Other raptors, monitor lizards, introduced red foxes, feral and domestic dogs, and feral pigs occasionally feed on emu eggs or kill small chicks.|$|E

From 1999 to 2006, the study tracked more than 2,000 students from age 11 or 12 to age 16; the study included students who had participated in one of four abstinence education programs, as well as a control group who had not participated in such a program. By age 16, about half of each group students in the abstinence-only program as well as students in the control group were still abstinent. Abstinence program participants who became sexually active during the 7-year study period reported having similar numbers of sexual partners as their peers of the same age; moreover, they had sex {{for the first time at}} about the same age as other students. The study also found that students who took part in the abstinence-only programs were <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> use contraception when they did have sex as those who did not participate.

In our sample of 276 U.

Moreover, whereas pornography viewing alone was not a predictor of risky online sexual activities, when the behavior escalated to engaging in Internet sex chat sites it did predict engagement in sexting or expectations of offline sex with those known only online. Based on these findings, we suggest that although these behaviors might be considered under one umbrella of online sexual activity, it might be useful from an intervention and treatment standpoint to target specific online sexual activities (e. g., sex site usage) ...|$|R

Individuals will do gaster wagging, wing vibrations, or other aggressions in order to assert their dominance and tell subordinates to forage. Therefore more dominant workers will tend to do tasks inside the nest.|$|E

40|$|Work was {{conducted}} among traditional, subsistence whale hunters in Lamalera, Indonesia {{in order to}} test if kinship or lineage membership is more important for explaining the organization of cooperative hunting parties ranging in size from 8 - 14 men. Crew identifications were collected for all 853 hunts that occurred between May 3 and August 5, 1999. Lineage identity and genetic relatedness were determined for a sample of 189 hunters. Results of matrix regression show that kinship explains little of the hunters' affiliations independent of lineage identity. Crews are much more related amongst themselves than expected by chance. This is due, however, to the correlation between lineage membership and kinship. Lineage members are much more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> affiliate in crews, but beyond r = 0. 5 kin are <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> not <b>to</b> affiliate.

25|$|In the 1960s, {{research}} by psychologists Loren and Jean Chapman showed {{that at least}} some of the apparent validity of the Rorschach was due to an illusion. At that time, the five signs most often interpreted as diagnostic of homosexuality were 1) buttocks and anuses; 2) feminine clothing; 3) male or female sex organs; 4) human figures without male or female features; and 5) human figures with both male and female features. The Chapmans surveyed 32 experienced testers about their use of the Rorschach to diagnose homosexuality. At this time homosexuality was regarded as a psychopathology, and the Rorschach was the most popular projective test. The testers reported that homosexual men had shown the five signs more frequently than heterosexual men. Despite these beliefs, analysis of the results showed that heterosexual men were <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report these signs, which were therefore totally ineffective for determining homosexuality. The five signs did, however, match the guesses students made about which imagery would be associated with homosexuality.|$|E

25|$|High {{voter turnout}} is often {{considered}} to be desirable, though among political scientists and economists specializing in public choice, the issue is still debated. A high turnout is generally seen {{as evidence of the}} legitimacy of the current system. Dictators have often fabricated high turnouts in showcase elections for this purpose. For instance, Saddam Hussein's 2002 plebiscite was claimed to have had 100% participation. Opposition parties sometimes boycott votes they feel are unfair or illegitimate, or if the election is for a government that is considered illegitimate. For example, the Holy See instructed Italian Catholics to boycott national elections for several decades after the creation of the state of Italy. In some countries, there are threats of violence against those who vote, such as during the 2005 Iraq elections, an example of voter suppression. However, some political scientists question the view that high turnout is an implicit endorsement of the system. Mark N.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purposes}} of this analysis were to compare the self-reported willingness of blacks, Puerto-Rican Hispanics and whites to participate as research subjects in biomedical studies, and to determine {{the reliability of the}} Tuskegee Legacy Project Questionnaire (TLP). METHODS: The TLP Questionnaire, initially used in a four-city study in 1999 - 2000, was administered in a follow-up study within a random-digit-dial telephone survey to a stratified random sample of adults in three different U. S. cities: Baltimore, MD; New York City; and San Juan, PR. The questionnaire, a 60 -item instrument, contains two validated scales: the Likelihood of Participation (LOP) Scale and the Guinea Pig Fear Factor (GPFF) Scale. RESULTS: Adjusting for age, sex, education, income and city, the LOP Scale was not statistically significantly different for the racial/ethnic groups (ANCOVA, p= 87). The GPFF Scale was statistically significantly higher for blacks and Hispanics as compared to whites (adjusted ANCOVA, p< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The of the findings from the current three-city study, as well as from our prior four-city study, are remarkably similar and reinforce the conclusion that blacks and Hispanics self-report that, despite having a higher fear of participation, they are <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> whites <b>to</b> participate in biomedical research...|$|R
