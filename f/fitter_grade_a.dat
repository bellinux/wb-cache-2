40|$|The Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD- 7) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} used diagnostic self-report scales for screening, diagnosis and severity assessment of anxiety disorder. Its psychometric properties from the view of the Item Response Theory paradigm have rarely been investigated. We aimed to close this gap by analyzing the GAD- 7 within a large sample of primary care patients with respect to its psychometric properties and its implications for scoring using Item Response Theory. Robust, nonparametric statistics were used to check unidimensionality of the GAD- 7. <b>A</b> <b>graded</b> response model was fitted using a Bayesian approach. The model fit was evaluated using posterior predictive p-values, item information functions were derived and optimal predictions of anxiety were calculated. The sample included N = 3404 primary care patients (60 % female; mean age, 52, 2; standard deviation 19. 2) The analysis indicated no deviations of the GAD- 7 scale from unidimensionality and a decent <b>fit</b> of <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> response model. The commonly suggested ultra-brief measure consisting of the first two items, the GAD- 2, was supported by item information analysis. The first four items discriminated better than the last three items with respect to latent anxiety. The information provided by the first four items should be weighted more heavily. Moreover, estimates corresponding to low to moderate levels of anxiety show greater variability. The psychometric validity of the GAD- 2 was supported by our analysis...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cancer care is {{increasingly}} {{provided in the}} outpatient setting, requiring specific monitoring of care quality. The patients' perspective is an important indicator of care quality {{and needs to be}} assessed with well designed, psychometrically sound questionnaires. We performed a systematic literature review of currently available patient satisfaction measures for use in cancer outpatient care settings. Methods: We carried out MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Scopus searches of papers published over the past 15 [*]years that describe cancer patient satisfaction questionnaires for use in the outpatient setting. We used the adapted COSMIN checklist to assess the quality of the questionnaires' measurement properties. Results: A total of 6677 citations were identified and 76 relevant articles were read, of which 55 were found either not to be relevant or to provide insufficient psychometric information. The remaining 21 studies pertained to 14 patient satisfaction questionnaires. Continuity and transition, accessibility, and involvement of family/friends were less frequently addressed despite their relevance in outpatient oncology. Almost half of the psychometric studies did not provide information on item level missing data. Most internal consistency estimates (Cronbach's α) were satisfactory. Few studies reported test-retest assessment (n[*]=[*] 5), used confirmatory factor analysis (n[*]=[*] 2), or assessed <b>fit</b> to <b>a</b> <b>graded</b> response item response theory model (n[*]=[*] 3). Only three questionnaires were cross-culturally validated. Conclusion: Important aspects of care may be missed by current patient satisfaction questionnaires for use in the cancer outpatient setting. Additional evidence is needed of their psychometric performance, especially for cross-cultural comparative assessments...|$|R

A {{robust and}} {{automatic}} {{system has been}} developed to detect the visual axis and extract important feature landmarks from slit-lamp photographs, and objectively grade the severity of nuclear sclerosis based on the intensities of those landmarks.

We evaluated the grading function using human grades as error bounds for “ground truth ” grades, and compared the machine grades with the human <b>grades.</b> <b>As</b> expected, the automatic system significantly speeds up the process of grading, and grades computed are consistent and reproducible. Machine grading time for one image is less than 2 seconds on a Pentium III 996 MHz machine while human grading takes about 2 minutes.

[Full text {{of this article is}} not available in the UHRA]A significant proportion of men with erectile dysfunction (ED) exhibit early signs of coronary artery disease (CAD), and this group may develop more severe CAD than men without ED (Level 1, <b>Grade</b> <b>A).</b> ??? The time interval among the onset of ED symptoms and the occurrence of CAD symptoms and cardiovascular events is estimated at 2 ??? 3 years and 3 ??? 5 years respectively; this interval allows for risk factor reduction (Level 2, Grade B). ??? ED is associated with increased all-cause mortality primarily due to increased cardiovascular mortality (Level 1, <b>Grade</b> <b>A).</b> ??? All men with ED should undergo a thorough medical assessment, including testosterone, fasting lipids, fasting glucose and blood pressure measurement. Following assessment, patients should be stratified according to the risk of future cardiovascular events. Those at high risk of cardiovascular disease should be evaluated by stress testing with selective use of computed tomography (CT) or coronary angiography (Level 1, <b>Grade</b> <b>A).</b> ??? Improvement in cardiovascular risk factors such as weight loss and increased physical activity has been reported to improve erectile function (Level 1, <b>Grade</b> <b>A).</b> ??? In men with ED, hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidaemia should be treated aggressively, bearing in mind the potential side effects (Level 1, <b>Grade</b> <b>A).</b> ??? Management of ED is secondary to stabilising cardiovascular function, and controlling cardiovascular symptoms and exercise tolerance should be established prior to initiation of ED therapy (Level 1, <b>Grade</b> <b>A).</b> ???
