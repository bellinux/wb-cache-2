40|$|The South African {{government}} has expressed an intention to market {{itself as a}} gateway to investment in Africa. This will be achieved inter alia by redesigning {{certain aspects of the}} tax laws in order to encourage investment into South Africa in the form of headquarter companies as a special kind of <b>holding</b> <b>companies.</b> The Netherlands has over time adjusted its tax regime to achieve the same goal, viz, to attract <b>holding</b> <b>companies</b> for investment into European countries and globally. Specifically, the Dutch participation exemption and the advance-tax ruling system have been hailed as the key tax instruments that are instrumental in attracting foreign residents to set up <b>holding</b> <b>companies</b> in the Netherlands. Furthermore, the intentional absence of various tax instruments such as controlled foreign-company provisions and exchange-control regulations further enhance the Netherlands' suitability to host <b>holding</b> <b>companies.</b> In light of the South African government's intentions to attract <b>holding</b> <b>companies,</b> it is important to study the Dutch system applicable to <b>holding</b> <b>companies</b> to see what attributes, if any, South Africa could also adopt.

50|$|The Consumer Federation of America {{and other}} {{commentators}} suggested securities firms had avoided becoming “financial holding companies” {{because they wanted}} to avoid Federal Reserve supervision as bank <b>holding</b> <b>companies.</b> The SEC (through its Chairman Arthur Levitt) had supported efforts to permit securities firms to engage in non-FDIC insured banking activities without the Federal Reserve’s “intrusive banking-style oversight” of the “overall holding company.” After the GLBA became law, securities firms continued (and expanded) their deposit and lending activities through the “unitary thrifts” and “nonbank banks” (particularly industrial loan companies) they had used before the GLBA to avoid regulation as bank <b>holding</b> <b>companies.</b> Alan Greenspan later noted securities firms only took on the “embrace” of Federal Reserve Board supervision as bank <b>holding</b> <b>companies</b> (and financial <b>holding</b> <b>companies)</b> after the financial crisis climaxed in September 2008.|$|R
40|$|Higher {{dividends}} {{may create}} value by reducing agency costs, {{but may also}} destroy value by increasing tax payments. This paper shows empirically how stockholders use <b>holding</b> <b>companies</b> to establish indirect ownership through operating companies {{in order to obtain}} the benefit of lower agency costs while also avoiding the cost of higher taxes. We identify this relationship by studying the effect of a regulatory shift in Norway from zero to positive dividend taxes for individuals, whereas intercorporate dividends remained tax-exempt. We find that the use of <b>holding</b> <b>companies</b> increases strongly after the tax reform, and that operating companies with a higher potential for agency conflicts are more often owned by <b>holding</b> <b>companies.</b> Dividends paid from operating <b>companies</b> to <b>holding</b> <b>companies</b> are higher when the operating company would face more severe agency conflicts if such payments were not made. The payout is also higher and more stable from operating <b>companies</b> than from <b>holding</b> <b>companies.</b> These findings are consistent with the notion that stockholders choose organizational forms that separate tax effects from agency effects in dividend policy...|$|R
