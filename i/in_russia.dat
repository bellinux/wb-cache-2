5|$|Berkman {{planned to}} write a book about his {{experience}} <b>in</b> <b>Russia,</b> but he postponed it while he assisted Goldman as she wrote a similar book, using as sources material he had collected. Work on Goldman's book, My Two Years <b>in</b> <b>Russia,</b> was completed in December 1922, and the book was published in two parts with titles not of her choosing: My Disillusionment <b>in</b> <b>Russia</b> (1923) and My Further Disillusionment <b>in</b> <b>Russia</b> (1924). Berkman worked on his book, The Bolshevik Myth, throughout 1923 and it was published in January 1925.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the early}} 16th {{and the late}} 17th centuries, an {{original}} tradition of stone tented roof architecture developed <b>in</b> <b>Russia.</b> It was quite unique and different from the contemporary Renaissance architecture elsewhere in Europe, though some research terms the style 'Russian Gothic' and compares it with the European Gothic architecture of the earlier period. The Italians, with their advanced technology, may have influenced {{the invention of the}} stone tented roof (the wooden tents were known <b>in</b> <b>Russia</b> and Europe long before). According to one hypothesis, an Italian architect called Petrok Maly may have been an author of the Ascension Church in Kolomenskoye, one of the earliest and most prominent tented roof churches.|$|E

5|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} the second most used form of {{renewable}} energy <b>in</b> <b>Russia</b> but represents less than 1% of the total energy production. The first geothermal power plant <b>in</b> <b>Russia</b> was built at Pauzhetka, Kamchatka, in 1966, with a capacity of 5MW. The total geothermal installed capacity in 2005 was 79MW, with 50MW coming from a plant at Verkhne-Mutnovsky. Russia is currently developing a 100MW plant at Mutnovsky and a 50MW plant in Kaliningrad. Most geothermal resources are currently used for heating settlements in the North Caucasus and Kamchatka. Half of the geothermal production is used to heat homes and industrial buildings, one third is used to heat greenhouses and 13% is used for industrial processes.|$|E

5|$|Hydropower is {{the most}} used form of {{renewable}} energy <b>in</b> <b>Russia,</b> and there is large potential <b>in</b> <b>Russia</b> for more use of hydropower. Russia has 102 hydropower plants with capacities of over 100MW, making it fifth {{in the world for}} hydropower production. It is also second in the world for hydro potential, yet only 20% of this potential is developed. Russia is home to 9% of the world's hydro resources, mostly in Siberia and the country's far east. At the end of 2005, the generating capacity from hydroelectric sources <b>in</b> <b>Russia</b> was 45,700MW, and an additional 5,648MW was under construction. The World Energy Council believes that Russia has much potential for using its hydro resources, with a theoretical potential of about 2,295TWh/yr, with 852TWh being economically feasible.|$|E
