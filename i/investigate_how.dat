5|$|With Craig Kundrot, Richards {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} high pressure (1000 atmospheres) on protein structure, using hen-egg lysozyme crystals, finding that the structure was robust to such pressures apart from a quite modest compaction in size.

5|$|Being low-lying {{and largely}} {{surrounded}} by water, Norfolk is {{particularly vulnerable to}} rising sea levels. In addition, the land on which it is built is slowly subsiding. Some areas already flood regularly at high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to <b>investigate</b> <b>how</b> {{to address the issue}} in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or more {{by the end of this}} century.|$|E
5|$|The {{project began}} with two aims: {{to prove the}} {{practicality}} of the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory based on standard cathode ray tubes (CRTs); and to construct a machine {{that could be used}} to <b>investigate</b> <b>how</b> computers might be able to assist in the solution of mathematical problems. The first of the series, the Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), ran its first program on 21 June 1948. As the world's first stored-program computer, the SSEM, and the Manchester Mark 1 developed from it, quickly attracted the attention of the United Kingdom government, who contracted the electrical engineering firm of Ferranti to produce a commercial version. The resulting machine, the Ferranti Mark 1, was the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked by}} {{the staff of the}} {{magazine}} Animerica if the anime was influenced by Western superheros like Spider-Man or Batman, Taniguchi denied that influence. Instead, he said his inspirations for s-CRY-ed were other works he had produced for Sunrise. The society shown in the series was not meant to be another take on classic superheroes but instead <b>investigate</b> <b>how</b> everyone can adapt to their own situation. While the series is known for the extensive action in its episodes, the director believes everything he wanted viewers to see was presented. To distinguish the HOLY members, the Sunrise staff researched the costumes they could design. Taniguchi said their outfits are meant to resemble prison uniforms.|$|E

On 4 October shareholders voted in favour of the sale, leaving Airbus entirely owned by EADS.|$|E
25|$|Fluorophores {{are more}} likely to be excited by photons if the {{transition}} moment of the fluorophore is parallel to the electric vector of the photon. The polarization of the emitted light will also depend on the transition moment. The transition moment is dependent on the physical orientation of the fluorophore molecule. For fluorophores in solution this means that the intensity and polarization of the emitted light is dependent on rotational diffusion. Therefore, anisotropy measurements can be used to <b>investigate</b> <b>how</b> freely a fluorescent molecule moves in a particular environment.|$|E
25|$|Neuroscience {{studies the}} nervous system, the {{physical}} {{basis of the}} mind. At the systems level, neuroscientists <b>investigate</b> <b>how</b> biological neural networks form and physiologically interact to produce mental functions and content such as reflexes, multisensory integration, motor coordination, circadian rhythms, emotional responses, learning, and memory. At a larger scale, efforts in computational neuroscience have developed large-scale models that simulate simple, functioning brains. As of 2012, such models include the thalamus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex, motor cortex, and occipital cortex, and consequentially simulated brains can learn, respond to visual stimuli, coordinate motor responses, form short-term memories, and learn to respond to patterns. Currently, researchers aim to program the hippocampus and limbic system, hypothetically imbuing the simulated mind with long-term memory and crude emotions.|$|E

25|$|Experimental {{cognitive}} psychologists {{carry out}} research on reasoning behaviour. Such research may focus, for example, on how people perform on tests of reasoning such as intelligence or IQ tests, or on how well people's reasoning matches ideals set by logic (see, for example, the Wason test). Experiments examine how people make inferences from conditionals e.g., If A then B and how they make inferences about alternatives, e.g., A or else B. They test whether people can make valid deductions about spatial and temporal relations, e.g., A is {{to the left of}} B, or A happens after B, and about quantified assertions, e.g., All the A are B. Experiments <b>investigate</b> <b>how</b> people make inferences about factual situations, hypothetical possibilities, probabilities, and counterfactual situations.|$|E
25|$|Experiences {{during the}} early part of the Second World War had {{demonstrated}} to the British that the Royal Navy needed access to defensive air cover for Allied fleets and convoys, which could only be provided by more aircraft carriers. In mid-1941, the Director of Naval Construction was instructed to <b>investigate</b> <b>how</b> best to achieve this without the lengthy construction times normally associated with carriers. The options were to refit the surviving Hawkins-class cruisers with flight decks and aviation facilities, convert additional merchant vessels and passenger liners into vessels similar to but more capable than previous merchant aircraft carriers, or create a new design for a cheap, lightly armed, and unarmoured ship similar to the Woolworth carriers. In December 1941, it was decided that a new design was the best option.|$|E
25|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{attention paid}} to foreign policy alienated the agricultural community in Italy which had been in decline since 1873. Both radical and conservative forces in the Italian parliament demanded that the government <b>investigate</b> <b>how</b> to improve agriculture in Italy. The investigation, which started in 1877 and was released eight years later, showed that agriculture was not improving, that landowners were earning revenue from their lands and contributing almost nothing {{to the development of}} the land. Lower class Italians were hurt by the break-up of communal lands to the benefit of landlords. Most of the workers on the agricultural lands were not peasants, but short-term laborers ("braccianti") who at best were employed for one year. Peasants without stable income were forced to live off of meager food supplies, disease was spreading rapidly and plagues were reported, including a major cholera epidemic which killed at least 55,000 people.|$|E
