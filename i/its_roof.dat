5|$|The city of Arcadia in DeSoto County saw extreme damage, {{in spite}} of being {{relatively}} further inland. About 95% of the buildings {{in the downtown area}} saw some sort of damage. The only shelter in the town had <b>its</b> <b>roof</b> torn open by the wind, leaving 3,500 evacuees inside unprotected from the onslaught of the storm.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{then moved}} into Tennessee and {{continued}} south of Huntland. Isolated and minor EF0 to EF1 damage was noted {{through most of}} its path in Tennessee. Widespread damage to trees and outbuildings occurred in this area. The worst damage, however, was to a cinder block utility building and was rated lower-end EF3. Most of <b>its</b> <b>roof</b> was removed, with over half of its downwind wall pushed outward. The tornado eventually dissipated east of Huntland.|$|E

The CM class is a powered passenger car. Class TTC is unpowered, it is equipped with a pantograph and a restaurant. The TT class is an unpowered passenger car which has also a pantograph on <b>its</b> <b>roof.</b> Each of the powered carriages is fitted with one motor on each of the two bogies. If needed, two trains can be coupled together.|$|E
5|$|Flooding was {{reported}} throughout the Outer Banks {{in relation to}} the heavy rains and storm surge of the storm. The storm required the shutdown of North Carolina Highway 12, the only highway connecting the area to the mainland, isolating those who decided to stay behind. Many residents lost power as numerous power lines fell from strong winds. Six brief tornadoes, ranging between F0 and F1 on the Fujita scale, struck the state within squall lines in the outer rainbands of Hurricane Bob. Four tornadoes in Dare County, North Carolina, caused $256,000 in damage. Near Cape Hatteras, wind severely damaged one structure, which lost <b>its</b> <b>roof</b> and some siding.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, {{there is}} a {{well-defined}} lowered area {{in the middle of}} the rostrum (front part), which nearly touches the back margin of the large, V-shaped nasal aperture (opening for the nose). Next to the aperture are two elevated areas, above the incisors. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are slender. The supraorbital ridges (located above the eyes) are well-developed. P.abramus, P.endoi, and P.paterculus have a flatter rostrum and less prominent supraorbital ridges. The braincase is of average size and bears a poorly developed sagittal crest on <b>its</b> <b>roof.</b> The supraoccipital, the backmost part of the skull, is convex. The sides of the concave palate are about parallel.|$|E

5|$|Local {{authorities}} closed airports, set up shelters, and readied {{emergency service}} personnel. Authorities in Martinique canceled {{a memorial to}} the victims of West Caribbean Airways Flight 708 and began to set up shelters. In Dominica, tourists were evacuated to concrete shelters {{and the vast majority of}} foreign medical students from the Ross University School of Medicine evacuated the island. The government of Dominica also canceled leave for emergency service personnel and evacuated Princess Margret Hospital, fearing that <b>its</b> <b>roof</b> might be vulnerable to the storm's winds. Martinique's main airport and both of St. Lucia's commercial airports closed when the last airplanes landed on the night of August 16 and the storm's outer rainbands began to sweep over the island.|$|E
5|$|Restoration {{work was}} carried out in the 1830s by William Craven, the Earl of Craven. This was a {{deliberate}} attempt at conserving the existing building, rather than rebuilding it, and was a very unusual approach at this time. By 1845, stone buttresses and pillars had been added to support parts of the hall and <b>its</b> <b>roof.</b> Research by Thomas Turner was published in 1851, outlining the history of the castle. Frances Stackhouse Acton, a local landowner, took a particular interest in the castle, and in 1853 convinced William to carry out further repair work on the castle, under her supervision, at a cost of £103.|$|E
5|$|The English had {{established}} a number of forts on the Leinster bank of the river, including Fort Frankford and, later, Fort Falkland (see Military History). The garrison at Fort Falkland was overrun {{by the forces of}} the Confederate Catholics in 1642 but was recaptured by Cromwell's army in 1650. The Cromwellians established a new fortification on the Connacht bank of the river leading up to the plantation of Connacht in 1654. The castle was modified in 1817 to enable it to mount artillery with a platform for a 24-pound traversing gun constructed on <b>its</b> <b>roof.</b> Its interior became a powder magazine and housed a garrison of 20 soldiers.|$|E
50|$|The {{church of}} Indang {{was one of}} the first churches in Cavite to use {{galvanized}} iron as <b>its</b> <b>roofing</b> in 1869. The adjacent old convento has wide windows and wrought iron work along the sides.|$|R

5|$|The Main Stand, {{which can}} seat 1,757 spectators, is an all-seated stand which runs around {{two-thirds of the}} pitch. It {{contains}} the dressing rooms, club offices, ticket offices and hospitality suites, and contains a number of supporting pillars. The stand has open corners to either side, {{one of which is}} where the supporters' club is located, and to the rear has windscreens to either side. At the front of it is the Family Stand, which offers adjusted rates for children and their carers. Opposite is the Popular Stand, a covered all-seated stand, which contains a number of supporting pillars and holds a television gantry on <b>its</b> <b>roof.</b> It can seat 1,652 spectators.|$|E
5|$|The Malagasy {{mountain}} mouse or Koopman's montane voalavo (Monticolomys koopmani) is a rodent {{within the}} subfamily Nesomyinae {{of the family}} Nesomyidae, and {{is closely related to}} Macrotarsomys. It is monotypic within the genus Monticolomys. It is found in the highlands of eastern Madagascar. A small mouse-like rodent, it is dark brown on the upperparts and dark gray below. It has small, rounded, densely haired ears and broad feet with well-developed pads. The long tail lacks a tuft at the tip. The skull is delicate and lacks crests and ridges on <b>its</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
5|$|The most {{noticeable}} {{feature of the}} fort is the circular keep. This was modeled on the reduit de surete of the Lunette d'Arçon, and it also bears similarities to the tour-reduits built in Malta in the early 18th century (the only surviving example is Vendôme Tower). It had two rows of musketry loopholes, and <b>its</b> <b>roof</b> contained a parapet with four embrasures. The latter was replaced with a sloping parapet to mount a single gun in the 1860s. The keep also contains the main gate, above which is a commemorative plaque.|$|E
50|$|St Thomas' Church {{is built}} of {{sandstone}} rubble and <b>its</b> <b>roofs</b> are slate. The plan {{consists of a}} nave with a tower to the west, a chancel and a transept to the north. The tower is square with extensions {{to the north and}} south. It has round-headed bell openings.|$|R

5|$|The {{music hall}} and cabaret are famous Paris institutions. The Moulin Rouge was opened in 1889. It was highly visible {{because of its}} large red {{imitation}} windmill on <b>its</b> <b>roof,</b> and became {{the birthplace of the}} dance known as the French Cancan. It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and Édith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the Folies Bergère. Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker. Later, Olympia Paris presented Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich, Miles Davis, Judy Garland, and the Grateful Dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower at}} {{the west end of}} the church dates from the early 17th century. It sits next to the {{south-west}} corner of the nave, aligned with the south wall, because the former church plan included a north aisle; the north wall of the tower meets the nave at <b>its</b> <b>roof</b> ridge. It is castellated and constructed of coursed roughly-dressed stone. It has two diagonal buttresses, two angled buttresses and four corner pinnacles. There are slate belfry louvres {{on each side of the}} tower and clock faces on the north and south sides.|$|E
5|$|The wooden stairs {{leading to}} the first floor {{replaced}} an earlier stone staircase, the remains of which can be seen protruding from the walls. The front room on the first floor had previously been partitioned, but the larger space was created when the new front wall was added to the building. <b>Its</b> <b>roof</b> has arched braced wooden trusses. The rear room still has the remains of a large fireplace, however, the chimney was blocked when the downstairs fireplace was installed.|$|E
