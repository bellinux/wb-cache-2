5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> love it.|$|E
25|$|Well, John {{has been}} on hunger strike since July. He {{resisted}} the forcible feeding for a good while, but submitted to the inevitable. Now he is being fed by a stomach tube twice daily. He has aged very much and has {{the look of a}} man who is going through torture... Seemingly anything is law in regard to John. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> will make the atrocity public. We must get him out of their clutches. It is nothing but slow murder...|$|E

When Welsh beat Phil Brock, he received a telegram from Macfadden stating 'Mr. Welsh - Dear Sir: <b>Hope</b> <b>you</b> will go through the whole bunch of meat eaters'.|$|E

Mrs. Rogers is at the White Mountains. I am going to Fairhaven this afternoon. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> will not be there. By the way, I have been using a pair of your gloves in the Mountains, and they don't seem to be much of an attraction.|$|E

500|$|I did {{not know}} about [...] {{involvement}} in this company. As an adult, he made that decision. It was a lapse in judgement for him to get involved with this company.
