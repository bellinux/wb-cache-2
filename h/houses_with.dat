5|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of people lost their homes, but many took {{this as an opportunity to}} rebuild stronger <b>houses.</b> <b>With</b> a new, structurally improved foundation, homes were redesigned to be able to withstand another hurricane. However, lack of arable crop land took away the jobs from many, decreasing an already low income even lower.|$|E

5|$|By 1890 {{official}} {{slum clearance}} programmes had begun. One {{was the creation}} of the world's first council housing, the LCC Boundary Estate, which replaced the neglected and crowded streets of Friars Mount, better known as The Old Nichol Street Rookery. Between 1918 and 1939 the LCC continued replacing East End housing with five or six storey flats, despite residents preferring <b>houses</b> <b>with</b> gardens and opposition from shopkeepers who were forced to relocate to new, more expensive premises. The Second World War brought an end to further slum clearance.|$|E
5|$|Clough's tenure {{especially}} {{focused on}} a dramatic expansion and modernization of the institute.

In 1998, Georgia Tech was the first university in the Southeastern United States to provide its fraternity and sorority <b>houses</b> <b>with</b> internet access. A campus wireless network, the Local Area Wireless/Walkup Network (LAWN), was established in 1999; it now covers most of the campus.|$|E

5|$|Like all Hindu Marathi {{people and}} to a varying degree with other Hindu Indians, Diwali is {{celebrate}}d over five days by the Deshastha Brahmins. Deshastha Brahmins celebrate this by waking up {{early in the morning}} and having an Abhyangasnan. People light their <b>houses</b> <b>with</b> lamps and candles, and burst fire crackers over the course of the festival. Special sweets and savouries like Anarse, Karanjya, Chakli, Chiwda and Ladu are prepared for the festival. Colourful Rangoli drawings are made in front of the house. Marathi children make a replica mud fort in memory of Shivaji, the great Maratha king.|$|E
5|$|Many foreign {{visitors}} to Iran {{of the time}} had commented on their pitiful situation. Traveller A.V.W. Jackson noted that Zoroastrians lived in constant fear of persecution by Muslim extremists and their lives were in danger whenever the fanatical spirit of Islam broke out, {{such as the one}} witnessed by him in Yazd. According to Edward Browne, the wall of Zoroastrian houses had to be lower than that of the Muslims and prohibited from marking their <b>houses</b> <b>with</b> distinctive signs. Zoroastrians were forbidden from erecting new houses and repairing old ones.|$|E

5|$|Maya {{households}} interred {{their dead}} underneath the floors of their <b>houses,</b> <b>with</b> offerings {{appropriate to the}} social status of the family. There the dead could act as protective ancestors. Maya lineages were patrilineal, so the worship of a prominent male ancestor would be emphasized, often with a household shrine. As Maya society developed, and the elite became more powerful, Maya royalty developed their household shrines into the great pyramids that held the tombs of their ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{domestic}} architecture {{had continued}} to develop, with the Normans, having first occupied the older Anglo-Saxon dwellings, rapidly beginning to build larger buildings in stone and timber. The elite preferred <b>houses</b> <b>with</b> large, ground-floor halls but the less wealthy constructed simpler <b>houses</b> <b>with</b> the halls on the first floor; master and servants frequently {{lived in the same}} spaces. Wealthier town-houses were also built using stone, and incorporated business and domestic arrangements into a single functional design. By the 14th century grander houses and castles were sophisticated affairs: expensively tiled, often featuring murals and glass windows, these buildings were often designed as a set of apartments to allow greater privacy. Fashionable brick began to be used {{in some parts of the}} country, copying French tastes. Architecture that emulated the older defensive designs remained popular. Less is known about the houses of peasants during this period, although many peasants appear to have lived in relatively substantial, timber-framed long-houses; the quality of these houses improved in the prosperous years following the Black Death, often being built by professional craftsmen.|$|E

5|$|Overall, Rananim {{affected}} about 18million {{people in}} China. A total of 3,321people were injured, 185 of them seriously. By {{the day after}} Rananim moved ashore, the death toll was estimated at 29, although {{by the next day}} the total reached 115. Four days after landfall, there were 147known deaths, which increased to 164 the following day. The final death toll was set at 168, although 24people were missing as of the last count. Most of the deaths were from collapsed <b>houses,</b> <b>with</b> others due to flooding, landslides, or flying debris.|$|E
5|$|Since the Middle Ages, most {{dwellings}} were log <b>houses</b> <b>with</b> notched corners, {{carefully crafted}} to ensure {{protection against the}} elements. Centrally placed open-hearth fires with smoke vents in the roofs gave way to stone stoves and chimneys in early modern times. Specialized buildings became commonplace, organized around farmyards or gårdstun. The introduction of exterior boarding (weatherboarding) in the 18th century improved housing standards considerably and gave rise to larger houses.|$|E

5|$|The Bronze Age in Scotland {{lasted from}} {{approximately}} 2000 BC to 800 BC.

The remains of several small oval <b>houses</b> <b>with</b> thick stone walls date to the late Bronze Age and the structures show some similarity to Skara Brae on Mainland, Orkney, but are smaller and of a later date. These buildings may have been partly subterranean at the earliest period of inhabitation, a technique that provided both structural stability and insulation.|$|E
5|$|The National Diet is the legislature, {{the organ}} of the Legislative branch.
