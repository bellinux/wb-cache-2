50|$|The ''''n'''' in <b>Harmful</b> (<b>Xn)</b> {{stands for}} the French word nocif (harmful) and the Italian word nocivo (noxious).|$|E
40|$|The Portuguese Pesticide Regulation Authority (AFN) classifies the {{fungicide}} MANCOZEB as <b>Harmful</b> (<b>Xn)</b> or Irritant (Xi), ignoring that: in UE, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) classify, beyond Xi, as R 63 – Possible risk of harm to {{the unborn}} child; and, in the USA, the Environmental Protection Agence (EPA) classify as Carcinogenic (Probable human carcinogen). These reality justify that mancozeb is a optimum example, in Portugal, of the strange and frequent diversity of toxicological classification of pesticides! This is quite serious as mancozeb {{is one of the}} two active ingredients (a. i.) most frequent in Portugal, as an individual a. i and 16 mixtures with the total of 65 products, and with a very high consumption (833, 6 t) in 2009 in a 3 º place after sulfur and, since 2001, the glyphosat...|$|E
50|$|In the old European Union standard, a black saltire set in {{an orange}} square is the hazard symbol for {{irritants}} (Xi) or <b>harmful</b> chemicals (<b>Xn).</b> It indicates a hazard less severe than skull and crossbones, used for poisons, or the corrosive sign.|$|R
40|$|A special {{challenge}} in the new European Union chemicals legislation, Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals, will be the toxicological evaluation of chemicals for reproductive toxicity. Use of valid quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSARs) is a possibility under the new legislation. This article focuses on a screening exercise by use of our own and commercial QSAR models for identification of possible reproductive toxicants. Three QSAR models were used for reproductive toxicity for the endpoints teratogenic risk to humans (based on animal tests, clinical data and epidemiological human studies), dominant lethal effect in rodents (in vivo) and Drosophila melanogaster sex-linked recessive lethal effect. A structure set of 57, 014 European Inventory of Existing Chemical Substances (EINECS) chemicals was screened. A total of 5240 EINECS chemicals, corresponding to 9. 2 %, were predicted as reproductive toxicants {{by one or more}} of the models. The chemicals predicted positive for reproductive toxicity will be submitted to the Danish Environmental Protection Agency as scientific input for a future updated advisory classification list with advisory classifications for concern for humans owing to possible developmental toxic effects: <b>Xn</b> (<b>Harmful)</b> and R 63 (Possible risk of harm to the unborn child). The chemicals were also screened in three models for endocrine disruption...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{growing number}} of studies have {{identified}} cleaners as a group at risk for adverse health effects of the skin and the respiratory tract. Chemical substances present in cleaning products could be responsible for these effects. Currently, only limited information is available about irritant and health hazardous chemical substances found in cleaning products. We hypothesized that chemical substances present in cleaning products are known health hazardous substances that might be involved in adverse health effects of the skin and the respiratory tract. Methods: We performed a systematic review of cleaning products used in the Swiss cleaning sector. We surveyed Swiss professional cleaning companies (n 51476) to identify the most used products (n 5105) for inclusion. Safety data sheets (SDSs) were reviewed and hazardous substances present in cleaning products were tabulated with current European and global harmonized system hazard labels. Results: Professional cleaning products are mixtures of substances (arithmetic mean 3. 5 ¡ 2. 8), and more than 132 different chemical substances were identified in 105 products. The main groups of chemicals were fragrances, glycol ethers, surfactants, solvents; and to a lesser extent, phosphates, salts, detergents, pH-stabilizers, acids, and bases. Up to 75 % of products contained irritant (Xi), 64 % <b>harmful</b> (<b>Xn)</b> and 28 % corrosive (C) labeled substances. Hazards for eyes (59 %) and skin (50 %), and hazards by ingestion (60 %...|$|E

Hazards for eyes (59 %) and skin (50 %), and hazards by ingestion (60 %) were the most reported. Cleaning products potentially give rise to simultaneous exposures to different chemical substances. As professional cleaners represent a large workforce, and cleaning products are widely used, it is a major public health issue to better understand these exposures. The list of substances provided in this study contains important information for future occupational exposure assessment studies...|$|E
