Without the <b>DNA</b> <b>methyltransferase</b> (DNMT), the replication machinery itself would produce daughter strands that are unmethylated and, over time, would lead to passive demethylation.

25|$|Epigenetics is {{the study}} of the {{regulation}} of gene expression through chemical, non-mutational changes in DNA structure. The theory of epigenetics in cancer pathogenesis is that non-mutational changes to DNA can lead to alterations in gene expression. Normally, oncogenes are silent, for example, because of DNA methylation. Loss of that methylation can induce the aberrant expression of oncogenes, leading to cancer pathogenesis. Known mechanisms of epigenetic change include DNA methylation, and methylation or acetylation of histone proteins bound to chromosomal DNA at specific locations. Classes of medications, known as HDAC inhibitors and <b>DNA</b> <b>methyltransferase</b> inhibitors, can re-regulate the epigenetic signaling in the cancer cell.|$|E
25|$|Whereas DNA {{methylation}} is {{not necessary}} per se for transcriptional silencing, it is thought nonetheless to represent a “locked” state that definitely inactivates transcription. In particular, DNA methylation appears critical {{for the maintenance of}} mono-allelic silencing in the context of genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation. In these cases, expressed and silent alleles differ by their methylation status, and loss of DNA methylation results in loss of imprinting and re-expression of Xist in somatic cells. During embryonic development, few genes change their methylation status, at the important exception of many genes specifically expressed in the germline. DNA methylation appears absolutely required in differentiated cells, as knockout of any of the three competent <b>DNA</b> <b>methyltransferase</b> results in embryonic or post-partum lethality. By contrast, DNA methylation is dispensable in undifferentiated cell types, such as the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, primordial germ cells or embryonic stem cells. Since DNA methylation appears to directly regulate {{only a limited number of}} genes, how precisely DNA methylation absence causes the death of differentiated cells remain an open question.|$|E

500|$|Epigenetics is {{the study}} of small, usually heritable, {{molecular}} modifications—or [...] "tags"—that bind DNA and modify gene expression levels. Targeting these tags with drugs can kill cancer cells.

Studies also show that giving patients these drugs before standard treatment can improve its effectiveness. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate how well these drugs kill lung cancer cells in humans. Several drugs that target epigenetic mechanisms are in development. Histone deacetylase inhibitors in development include valproic acid, vorinostat, belinostat, panobinostat, entinostat, and romidepsin. <b>DNA</b> <b>methyltransferase</b> inhibitors in development include decitabine, azacytidine, and hydralazine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} Arabidopsis <b>DNA</b> <b>methyltransferase</b> enzymes, which {{transfer and}} covalently attach methyl groups onto DNA, are DRM2, MET1, and CMT3.

There are currently two classes of DNA methyltransferases: 1) the de novo class, or enzymes that create new methylation marks on the DNA; and 2) a maintenance class that recognizes the methylation marks on the parental strand of DNA and transfers new methylation to the daughters strands after DNA replication. DRM2 is the only enzyme that has been implicated as a de novo <b>DNA</b> <b>methyltransferase.</b> DRM2 has also been shown, along with MET1 and CMT3 {{to be involved in}} maintaining methylation marks through DNA replication.

50|$|DNA {{methylation}} is an epigenetic mechanism. It is {{a chemical}} {{modification of the}} DNA where a methyl group is attached to cytosine.
