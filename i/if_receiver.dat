40|$|The {{development}} of wireless communication systems into multi-standard radio architectures that can process {{a multitude of}} frequency bands and modulation schemes has lead to a growing demand for wideband receiver front-ends. To allow for portability and low cost, these new architectures {{also need to be}} low power, compact size integrated circuits with a higher degree of components integrated on chip. These requirements have made the simple architecture of the Zero <b>IF</b> <b>receiver</b> especially attractive for this application. The design of a Zero <b>IF</b> <b>receiver</b> that complies both with current standards such as GSM and UMTS as well as the new standards WiMAX and LTE meet several challenges. Both the new standards take advantage of the multi carrier modulation scheme OFDM to increase spectral efficiency, which demands for higher linearity because of a non constant signal envelope. Also the frequency spectrum allocated for WiMAX/ LTE range from 900 MHz to 5. 8 GHz which is several GHz higher than current multi-standard receivers. One possible solution for a high linearity wideband Zero <b>IF</b> <b>receiver</b> is to use the recently developed common gate LNA with capacitive cross-coupling technique, together with a passive down-conversion mixer that has inherently high linearity. In this work an inductorless wideband zero <b>IF</b> <b>receiver</b> front-end is designed. System level budget analysis is performed for the targeted standards WiMAX/LTE to extract noise figure, gain and linearity requirements for the design of the LNA and down-conversion mixer. The WiMAX/LTE receiver front-end is designed using 1. 2 V 90 nm CMOS and consumes 7 mW. The receiver front-end provides a gain of 25 dB covering a bandwidth of 4. 5 GHz with a noise figure below 5 dB and midband IIP 3 of - 20 dBm.

40|$|In multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels, {{the design}} {{criterion}} for full-diversity space-time block codes (STBCs) is primarily {{determined by the}} decoding method at the receiver. Although constructions of STBCs have predominantly matched the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder, design criteria and constructions of full-diversity STBCs have also been reported for low-complexity linear receivers. A new receiver architecture called Integer-Forcing (IF) linear receiver has been proposed by Zhan et al. which showed promising results for the high-rate V-BLAST encoding scheme. In this work we address the design of full-diversity STBCs for IF linear receivers. We derive an upper bound on the probability of decoding error, and show that STBCs that satisfy the non-vanishing singular value (NVS) property provide full-diversity for the <b>IF</b> <b>receiver.</b> Further, we prove that all known STBCs with the non-vanishing determinant property are applicable for IF receivers, as they guarantee the NVS property.
