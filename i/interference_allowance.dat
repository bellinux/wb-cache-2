50|$|In {{addition}} to the changes on the forward link, the reverse link was enhanced to support higher complexity modulation (and thus higher bit rates). An optional secondary pilot was added, which is activated by the mobile when it tries to achieve enhanced data rates. To combat reverse link congestion and noise rise, the protocol calls for each mobile to be given an <b>interference</b> <b>allowance</b> which is replenished by the network when the reverse link conditions allow it. The reverse link has a maximum rate of 1.8 Mbit/s, but under normal conditions users experience a rate of approximately 500-1000 kbit/s but with more latency than cable and dsl.|$|E

30|$|Multicell joint {{processing}} has {{originated from}} information-theoretic principles {{as a means}} of reaching the fundamental capacity limits of cellular networks. However, global multicell joint decoding is highly complex and in practice clusters of cooperating Base Stations constitute a more realistic scenario. In this direction, the mitigation of intercluster interference rises as a critical factor towards achieving the promised throughput gains. In this paper, two intercluster interference mitigation techniques are investigated and compared, namely interference alignment and resource division multiple access. The cases of global multicell joint processing and cochannel <b>interference</b> <b>allowance</b> are also considered as an upper and lower bound to the interference alignment scheme, respectively. Each case is modelled and analyzed using the per-cell ergodic sum-rate throughput as a figure of merit. In this process, the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of the channel covariance matrices is analytically derived based on free-probabilistic arguments in order to quantify the sum-rate throughput. Using numerical results, it is established that resource division multiple access is preferable for dense cellular systems, while cochannel <b>interference</b> <b>allowance</b> is advantageous for highly sparse cellular systems. Interference alignment provides superior performance for average to sparse cellular systems on the expense of higher complexity.|$|E

An inter-cluster <b>interference</b> <b>allowance</b> scheme is considered and various user power allocation profiles are investigated in terms of optimal achievable sum rate to highlight that cell-based power allocation is preferable to cluster-based. The contribution of each base station on the cluster sum rate is investigated and its importance is discussed. Numerical results are produced for a real-world scenario showing how medium density systems are the most viable case for clustered system design by achieving > 80 % of the global cooperation capacity...|$|E
40|$|Multicell joint {{processing}} {{has been}} proven to be very efficient in overcoming the interference-limited nature of the cellular paradigm. However, for reasons of practical implementation global multicell joint decoding is not feasible and thus clusters of cooperating Base Stations have to be considered. In this context, intercluster interference has to be mitigated in order to harvest the full potential of multicell joint processing. In this paper, four scenarios of intercluster interference are investigated, namely a) global multicell joint processing, b) interference alignment, c) resource division multiple access and d) cochannel <b>interference</b> <b>allowance.</b> Each scenario is modelled and analyzed using the per-cell ergodic sum-rate capacity as a figure of merit. In this process, a number of theorems are derived for analytically expressing the asymptotic eigenvalue distributions of the channel covariance matrices. The analysis is based on principles from Free Probability theory and especially properties in the R and Stieltjes transform domain. Comment: 16 pages, 4 figures, 1 tabl...|$|E
