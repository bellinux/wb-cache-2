6000|$|I {{raised my}} hand. Mr. Marx whispered, [...] "Now!" [...] And the bouquet was lying at her feet. She {{picked it up}} gracefully, shot a coquettish glance up towards me, and then the curtain fell, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in my chair, feeling quite {{convinced}} that I had made an utter fool of myself.|$|E
60|$|And <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and marvelled {{secretly}} at this encyclopaedic-minded man, this Leith Clay-Randolph, {{this common}} tramp who made himself {{at home in}} my den, charmed such friends as gathered at my small table, outshone me with his brilliance and his manners, spent my spending money, smoked my best cigars, and selected from my ties and studs with a cultivated and discriminating eye.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in my {{corner and}} looked out into the darkness. Feurgéres, {{opposite}} to me, was leaning back with half-closed eyes. From his soft, regular breathing it seemed almost as though he slept. For me there was no thought of rest or sleep. I made plans only to discard them, rehearsed speeches, appeals, threats, only to realize their hopeless ineffectiveness. And underneath it all was a dull constant pain, the pain which stays.|$|E
60|$|At dusk {{that evening}} <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> on the <b>back</b> door-step, by the orchard, {{cleaning}} his rifle. The sound of steps {{came from the}} little passage behind me, and a hand was on my head.|$|R
6000|$|Presently, <b>I</b> remember, she <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> on {{her heels}} and looked up into my face. [...] "We've done wrong--and parting's paying. It's time to pay. We needn't have paid, if we'd kept to the track.... You and I, Master, we've got to be men." ...|$|R
60|$|We rowed out {{on to the}} Firth, or, to be more {{strictly}} correct, the two Grantons rowed while Charles and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{and leaned}} <b>back</b> in the stern on the luxurious cushions. They rowed fast and well. In a very few minutes they had rounded the point and got clear {{out of sight of}} the Cockneyfied towers and false battlements of Seldon.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was still}} a trifle hazy about the plot, but I had got on {{to the fact that}} Cyril was some sort of an English peer who had come over to America doubtless for the best reasons. So far he had only had two lines to say. One was [...] "Oh, I say!" [...] and the other was [...] "Yes, by Jove!"; but I seemed to recollect, from hearing him read his part, that pretty soon he was due rather to spread himself. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in my chair and waited for him to bob up.|$|E
6000|$|Glad was I {{to get him}} out of {{the silk}} warehouse, and then out of a {{jewellers}} shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a sense of annoyance and degradation. As we re-entered the carriage, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events, dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten--the letter of my uncle, John Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his legatee. [...] "It would, indeed, be a relief," [...] I thought, [...] "if I had ever so small an independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr. Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling daily round me. I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I could better endure to be kept by him now." [...] And somewhat relieved by this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought mine, though I averted both face and gaze. He smiled; and I thought his smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow on a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the passionate pressure.|$|E

60|$|When I awoke, {{the western}} sky was {{an ocean of}} saffron and gold. Amidst its haze, stood up the distant {{clustered}} chimneys of Wanderslore: and I realized I must be in an outlying hollow of the park--farthest from Beechwood Hill. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> up, bound <b>back</b> my hair, and, bathing my swollen feet in the dark, ice-cold water, I watched the splendour fade.|$|R
25|$|I knew I {{was going}} to cop a lot of stick {{but it will be}} like water off a duck's back...I {{expected}} stick {{at the start of the}} innings, and I'm sure it will carry on through the whole series.

60|$|While Livy and Miss Spaulding {{have been}} writing at this table, <b>I</b> have <b>sat</b> tilted <b>back,</b> near by, with a pipe and the last Atlantic, and read Charley Warner's article with prodigious enjoyment.

5000|$|In July 2004, Beuerlein {{signed a}} one-day {{contract}} with the Panthers to retire {{as a member of}} the team. Commenting on the decision to retire with the team, Beuerlein stated [...] "This in my mind was the way it was meant to be. I couldn't think of a better way to bring this 17-year run to an end. My heart has always been here with this organization and when <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and decided I wanted to step down, there was no doubt I wanted to do it as a Carolina Panther." ...|$|E

A good friend of mine had just passed. There was not a more opportune time to write a song like [...] "The Bleeding." [...] It's probably the most personal song I've ever written." ...|$|E
5000|$|In Forgotten Voices of the Great War, Demuth {{is quoted}} as saying:"Almost the last feather I {{received}} was on a bus. I was sitting near the door when I became aware of two women {{on the other side}} talking at me, and I thought to myself, 'Oh Lord, here we go again'. One lent forward and produced a feather and said, 'Here's a gift for a brave soldier. I took it and said,'Thankyou very much- I wanted one of those.' Then I took my pipe out of my pocket and put this feather down the stem and worked it in a way I've never worked a pipe cleaner before. When it was filthy I pulled it out and said, 'You know, we didn't get these in the trenches', and handed it back to her. She instinctively put out her hand and took it, so there she was sitting with this filthy pipe cleaner in her hand and all the other people on the bus began to get indignant. Then she dropped it and got up to get out, but we were nowhere near a stopping place and the bus went on quite a long way while she got well and truly barracked {{by the rest of the}} people on the bus. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and laughed like mad." ...|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> with my <b>back</b> {{against the}} trunk of the great tree and tried to realize the situation. Looking to my left I saw too good horses--one bare-backed, and one with a rudely made lady's saddle on it. By the side of the horses were two dogs, of a stout {{greyhound}} breed, that sat watching us, and near the dogs lay a dead Oribé buck, which they had evidently been coursing.|$|R

For myself, I would never again try to achieve the impossible by trying to change things.

5000|$|In {{regards to}} her split from manager/producer George Tobin, she stated [...] "We weren't in sync anymore. Basically, I {{wanted to do}} R&B music, and he wanted a certain other sound. When I first signed with George, I was 12 years old and thankful to be {{fulfilling}} my dream. I appreciate that, but now the game is at a different level. I needed a manager who understood the R&B and pop markets, and who understood my wanting to become {{more involved in the}} making of the music. So, I never told anyone I was looking for a new manager. <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and observed everyone I could. New Kids on the Block manager Dick Scott really stood out as the best." ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 A memoir is {{variously}} {{defined as}} an abbreviated autobiography; a record of events based on the writer's personal observation or knowledge; and the written story of one's own life. I {{set out to do}} those things. But when <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> to read the first of many drafts, I discovered my story was her story-my mother's. At some level, I have always known this. But I was unprepared to see the evidence writ large. But more than that, I was dismayed that the wisdom I imagined my calendar years had conferred, was not reflected in my writing. There was still the primal wail of a weeping child. Quieter, of course. Wailing is not seemly for occasions other than childbirth, great loss, or sudden death. And railing against the past is utterly futile. Foolish. I found great comfort in the words of C. S. Lewis. They mirrored my experience. As the telling of my story deepened, the writing became, successively, an incision, a probe, and as Lewis says, a surgery of the gods. Like surgery, there was first of all fear, followed by pain, discovery, excision, loss, repair and restoration, and finally, healing and a different outlook altogether. I found great value in revisiting these memories and seeing that the giants of my young years are only human, after all, not the ogres I imagined. Like the shadow in a darkened room, the house cat stretched on the window sill looms like a great inscrutable Sphinx. A tree branch, benign by day, morphs into a grotesque claw, scratching and scraping at the window pane. Memories rear up at first like ghosts in a graveyard. But under a steady beam of light, the apparitions subside. Writing this memoir has been a window into the past, perhaps an icon, a way of seeing beyond the surface and into the soul. My own certainly, and perhaps glimpses of the others I've written about as well. Two central truths have emerged from writing my memoir. The first is the power of forgiveness in healing relationships. Forgiveness is not our natural bent; it goes completely against our natural state. But we can choose to change. Just as learning to swim is counter to our earthbound existence, but possible, learning to embrace the freedom of forgiveness is also possible. The second is something I've always sensed, but now know: the innate power of a mother to shape the soul of her child...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> on the <b>back</b> {{seat of the}} carriage, near a {{very nice}} young lady, about my dear Mary's age--that is to say, {{seventeen}} and three-quarters; and opposite us sat the old Countess and her other grand-daughter--handsome too, but ten years older. I recollect I had on that day my blue coat and brass buttons, nankeen trousers, a white sprig waist-coat, and one of Dando's silk hats, that had just come in in the year '22, and looked {{a great deal more}} glossy than the best beaver.|$|R

60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> with my <b>back</b> to the wall, staring {{blankly at}} the {{trembling}} landlord, who was ready {{at any moment}} to foam at the mouth, and at the dour landlady, who was quite capable of keeping him in order, there came {{in one of those}} dark, showy Italian girls with a man. She wore a blouse and skirt, and no hat. Her hair was perfectly dressed. It was really Italy. The man was soft, dark, he would get stout later, trapu, he would have somewhat the figure of Caruso. But as yet he was soft, sensuous, young, handsome.|$|R
5000|$|Dread Central {{wrote that}} [...] "There is {{nothing better than}} a great bad movie", and the film's cast of B-Movie horror and sci-fi celebrities {{sweetened}} the deal in creating a film [...] "that epitomizes everything that is so scrumptious about all of your favorite B-Movie entrees". They also wrote that the film acts as a [...] "compilation/montage/homage..." [...] "...of nearly every early monster or sci-fi film ever made". After viewing it, the reviewer wrote that the film began [...] "beyond cheesy and damn near annoying at first, but once I finally understood what the filmmakers were attempting to do <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>back,</b> set my brain on coast, and enjoyed the ride". He enjoyed that the acting was [...] "intentionally atrocious", the monster [...] "unbelievably ludicrous", the plotline and story [...] "full-blown stupidity at its finest", {{and the use of}} nudity [...] "relentlessly gratuitous", writing that [...] "you can't help but take pleasure in watching the brilliantly calculated cinematic train wreck." ...|$|R

60|$|After a while, as I grew stronger, I {{was driven}} down {{and allowed to}} walk on the wide beach that {{stretched}} in front of the gay houses facing the sea. Cormorants dived under the long rollers that came crashing in from the Pacific; gulls wheeled and screamed in the soft wind; alert little birds darted here and there with incredible swiftness, leaving tiny footprints across the ribs and furrows of the wet sand. Far to the southward a dark barrier of mountains rose out of the sea. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> with my <b>back</b> against the dunes watching the drag of the outgoing water rolling the pebbles after it, making a gleaming floor for the light to dance.|$|R
60|$|After supper we lounged {{around a}} cheerful, {{crackling}} camp-fire. The blaze roared in the breeze, the red embers glowed white and opal, the smoke swooped down and curled {{away into the}} night shadows. Old Dan, as usual, tried {{to sit in the}} fire, and had to be rescued. Buck came to me where <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> with my <b>back</b> to a pine, my feet to the warmth. He was lame to-night, having run all day on that injured leg. The other dogs lay scattered around in range of the heat. Natural indeed was it then, in such an environment, after talking over the auspicious start of our hunt at Dude Creek, that we should drift to the telling of stories.|$|R
60|$|For some seconds <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> there, leaning <b>back</b> in {{my chair}} and gazing close at that incredible, that accusing document. I knew it couldn't lie: I knew {{it must be the}} very handiwork of unerring Nature. Then slowly a {{recollection}} began to grow up in my mind. I knew of my own memory it was really true. I remembered it so, now, as in a glass, darkly. I remembered having stood, with the pistol in my hand, pointing it straight at the breast of the man with the long white beard whom they called my father. A new mental picture rose up before me like a vision. I remembered it all as something that once really occurred to me.|$|R
50|$|Pietersen {{was upset}} {{not to be}} {{initially}} in the squad to tour South Africa. With Flintoff withdrawing due to injury, Pietersen was recalled to the squad, and cemented {{his place in the}} first team with 97 off 84 balls in the warm-up match against South Africa A, {{in the face of a}} hostile crowd. Throughout the tour, Pietersen was subjected to a barrage of abuse from the South African crowd, who regarded him somewhat like a traitor. He said:I knew I was going to cop a lot of stick but it will be like water off a duck's back...I expected stick at the start of the innings, and I'm sure it will carry on through the whole series.

500|$|As for the criticisms, she said, [...] "I am who I am and I will {{continue}} to be." [...] She portrayed some of her views on her life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with Gloria Steinem: [...] "Now, I have friends in all {{the countries of the}} world. <b>I</b> haven’t just <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don’t have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I’ve never had it easy. I’m not like all you ... all those people who had it easy." ...|$|R
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> face to {{face with}} Maxwell Hartington, my solicitor, in his ink-splashed, dirty, yellow-grained room with its rows of black tin boxes, I could no longer ignore that possibility. Maxwell Hartington <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in his chair after his fashion, {{listening}} to my story, breathing noisily through his open mouth, perspiring little beads and looking more out of condition than ever. I never knew a man so wine-sodden and so sharp-witted.|$|R
60|$|Hitherto, while {{gathering}} up {{the discourse of}} Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude observation.

5000|$|The [...] "generation gap" [...] {{between the}} {{affluent}} young and their often poverty-scarred parents {{was a critical}} component of 1960s culture.

A hardscrabble child of the Great Depression, Pat Nixon told Steinem, [...] "I never had time to think about things like that, who I wanted to be, or who I admired, or to have ideas. I never had time to dream about being anyone else. I had to work. <b>I</b> haven't just <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do...I've kept working.

60|$|The curtain fell. There {{was twenty}} minutes' interval. Isobel <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in her chair, {{and her hand}} lingered lovingly about the roses which lay upon her lap.

60|$|But my {{thoughts}} wandered from the doings {{of the son}} of Iapetus, until at last I flung down the book and <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in my chair all lost in thought, in doubt, and in conjecture.
