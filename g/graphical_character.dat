The system imposes contact and task constraints to add dynamic impacts for interactions with the environment and to modify motions at the behavior level. The system is able to edit motion data to account for changes in characters and the environment as well as create smooth transitions between motion capture sequences. We demonstrate the power of combining these two approaches by tracking data {{for a variety of}} upper-body motions and by animating models with differing kinematic and dynamic parameters...|$|E

40|$|Plant–soil {{feedbacks}} {{can have}} important implications for the interactions among plants. Understanding these effects is a major challenge since it is inherently difficult to measure and manipulate highly diverse soil communities. Mathematical models may advance this understanding by making the interplay of the various processes affecting plant–soil interaction explicit and by quantifying the relative importance of the factors involved. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a complete analysis of a pioneering plant–soil feedback model developed by Bever and colleagues (J Ecol 85 : 561 – 573, 1997; Ecol Lett 2 : 52 – 62, 1999; New Phytol 157 : 465 – 473, 2003) to fully understand the range of possible impacts of plant–soil feedbacks on plant communities within this framework. We analyze this model by means of a new graphical method that provides a complete classification of the potential effects of soil communities on plant competition. Due to the <b>graphical</b> <b>character</b> of the method, the results are relatively easy to obtain and understand. We show that plant diversity depends crucially on two key parameters that may be viewed as measures of the intensity of plant competition and the direction and strength of plant– soil feedback, respectively. Our analysis provides a formal underpinning of earlier claims that plant–soil feedbacks, especially when they are negative, may enhance the diversity of plant communities. In particular, negative plant–soil feedbacks can enhance the range of plant coexistence by inducing competitive oscillations. However, these oscillations can also destabilize plant coexistence, leading to low population densities and extinctions. In addition, positive feedbacks can allow locally stable forms of plant coexistence by inducing alternative stable states. Our findings highlight that the inclusion of plant–soil interactions may fundamentally alter the predictions on the structure and functioning of above-ground ecosystems. The scenarios presented in this study can be used to formulate hypotheses about the ways soil community effects may influence plant competition that can be tested with empirical studies. This will advance our understanding of the role of plant–soil feedback in ecological communities...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Consumer Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 Literature {{addressing}} South African {{children as}} consumers is limited. Considering the growing {{importance of this}} young emerging market, a study addressing {{some aspects of the}} South African child as a consumer might provide valuable information and guidelines to marketers and manufacturers, in particular, a way to attract these young consumers' attention to products that will possibly better serve their needs. Colour and graphics can be highlighted as a method to reach these consumers. This {{can be attributed to the}} fact that children between the ages of three and seven years are within the preoperational stage of cognitive development and their attention is consequently fixed on only one stimulus at a time, for instance, the colour and/or graphics. Cereal is a widely acclaimed children's product of which a wide variety is available on the shelves of South African grocery outlets. However, the extent to which South African children belonging to this age group are influenced by these claimed colour and graphics is debatable. Based on these arguments the present study was driven by the question whether seven-year-old child consumers have definite colour and graphical perceptual preferences regarding the packaging design of cereal products. An exploratory investigation was conducted within a South African context to meet the following objectives, to determine firstly, the association of seven-year-old children regarding colour and graphics of cereal box packaging by exploring the perceptually preferred colours and graphics in cereal box packaging. Secondly, to determine the conceptualisation of seven-year-old children regarding colour and graphics of cereal box packaging design through the composition of an ideal cereal box. Findings of this qualitative study confirmed existing perceptual preferences among child consumers that should be taken into consideration by manufacturers and marketers. Results included a tendency under child consumers to focus on personal factors when perceptually most preferred cereal box colour and graphic choices were made. This was in contrast with colour and <b>graphical</b> <b>character</b> qualities being the main criteria when perceptually least preferred cereal box design choices had to be made. It is evident that manufacturers should focus on softer, aesthetically pleasing characters on an either pink or purple background when girls are the target market, whereas boys would favour humorous, strong, aggressive characters on a background of any of the primary colours. Most significant, was regardless of their preferred colour and graphics, the most important factor was their pre-occupation with matching graphics to the background colours of the packaging. Manufacturers and marketers can use this information to package their products to be as child consumer friendly as possible, which could result in a favourable perception of and behaviour towards the trademark well into adulthood.

5000|$|Beyond {{the manual}} labor of type-ins, {{it was not}} {{uncommon}} for certain magazines to print poor quality listings, presenting the reader with nearly illegible characters (especially in the case where machine-code data was printed using extended ASCII glyphs instead of DATA statements); this typically happened when transferring the list output from the era's ubiquitous 7-8-pin dot-matrix printers directly to the printing presses - sometimes even without prettyprinting. This was particularly troublesome in listings which contained <b>graphical</b> <b>characters</b> representing control codes, used for e.g. cursor movements; such characters tended to be less legible than alphanumeric ones in the first place. Additional issues arose after the advent of BASICs that did not require line numbers as the magazine broke logical lines across physical lines due to space constraints and without the line numbers the distinction was not always apparent. Compute! even for a time used a handwritten arrow to represent a carriage return in its program listings. Of course, some errors in type-ins were the result of programmer error, and were simply bugs in the program.

40|$|Cognitive {{modeling}} is {{a provocative}} new paradigm that {{paves the way}} towards intelligent <b>graphical</b> <b>characters</b> by providing them with logic and reasoning skills. Cognitively empowered self-animating characters will see {{in the near future}} a widespread use in the interactive game, multimedia, virtual reality and production animation industries. This review covers three recently-published papers from the field of cognitive modeling for computer animation. The approaches and techniques employed are very different.

The second paper uses an active plan tree and a plan library to achieve the fast and robust reactivity to the environment changes. The third paper, based on an AI formalism known as the situation calculus, develops a cognitive modeling language called CML and uses it to specify a behavior outline or "sketch plan " to direct the characters in terms of goals.
