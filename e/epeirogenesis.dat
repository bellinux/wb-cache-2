40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{forms of}} Brazilian relief cannot be {{understood}} without the comprehension of what occurs with the South America relief. The structural and sculptural processes developed in Brazilian relief are straightly related with the Atlantic opening {{and the formation}} of Andes Orogenic Chains. The Meso-Cenozoic <b>epeirogenesis</b> unleashed the denudational processes that set a definite mark in Brazilian relief formation. The great forms are associated with structures of Cratons, Orogenic Belts and Sedimentary Basins. These great morphologies are produced by several Pre and Post-Cretaceous erosive phases under the effect of the ancient tectonic and the Cenozoic. High altimetry positions coincide with lithologies of igneous mass and rocks of high metamorphism and, downgraded reliefs sculpted on rocks of low metamorphism that suggest important effects of chemical detritions operating on the genesis of shapes of the Brazilian relief...|$|E

Thus, the relief of this territory formed through a selective evolution, in the longway of Moldavia valley, dominating the fluvial accumulation process and on the slopes and sub Carpathian tops, prevailing the fluviodedutionale process. The main role in the relief shaping belonged of the hydrographic arteries {{in the context of}} the <b>epeirogenesis</b> movements and of climatic quaternary variations.  On the territory of the village Cornu Luncii there are 2 pedo-climatic micro zones (III-O-SP with numerical code 82 habitat 2, which cover 611, 29 ha, that mean 12, 02 % and III-LSA, with numerical code 93 habitat 1, which cover 4539, 19 ha, that mean 87, 98 %). </p...|$|E
40|$|The passive {{continental}} margins which {{surround the}} North Atlantic region {{have been subject}} to widespread post-Triassic exhumation, the timing, magnitude and causes of which are debated. Exhumation of up to 6 km (but more generally ≤ 3 km) has been shown to have affected the Western UK Continental Shelf. This region contains a series of intra-plate extensional basins which formed during Permian-Jurassic rifting. Using a combination of palaeothermal (apatite fission-track analysis and vitrinite reflectance data) seismic and compaction data, this study has revealed an exhumation history of far greater complexity than previously suspected across the Southwest UK, with regional kilometer-scale exhumation episodes beginning during the Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic (215 - 195 Ma), Lower Cretaceous (140 - 120 Ma), early Paleogene (75 - 55 Ma), Eocene-Oligocene (35 - 20 Ma) and Neogene (20 - 10 Ma). Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic exhumation appears confined to the footwalls of major basin bounding faults, suggesting footwall uplift was the principal cause of this episode of exhumation. Lower Cretaceous exhumation corresponds with continental breakup SW of Britain, suggesting a causative link. Early Paleogene exhumation was coeval with the Laramide phase of Alpine orogeny suggesting a causative link and additionally, marked heterogeneities in the pattern of this exhumation have been identified, casting doubt on the previously invoked role of plume-related <b>epeirogenesis.</b> Eocene-Oligocene and Neogene exhumation coincides temporally with the Pyrenean and Late Alpine compressional episodes. Seismic data shows that early and late Cenozoic exhumation was probably caused by compressional deformation related to Alpine orogenesis and/or Atlantic ridge-push. These observations imply that events at plate margins have exerted the primary control upon intra-plate exhumation in the Southwest UK onshore and offshore basin system with local faults providing an important control on the distribution of this exhumatio...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{terraces}} flanking the Lower Orange River {{in the study}} area were deposited after ca. 90 % of the incision had occurred, thus only the late stage incision/depositional history of this margin is able to be addressed here. Two principal suites of river terraces are distinguished by their palaeo-courses, bedrock strath levels, overall geometry and clast assemblages: an older, higher lying Proto suite and a younger Meso suite. The Proto suite represents a long, post-Eocene, through the Oligocene into the Early Miocene, phase of incision, followed by a prolonged period of aggradation where up to 90 m of fluvial, diamondiferous deposits accumulated during the Early-Middle Miocene. The Meso suite of deposits represents shorter phrases of incision and aggradation in the Pilo-Pleistocene. The Proto and Meso deposits were built in response to both base level rise and increased supply of material from tributaries draining the Great Escarpment locally, with clast assemblage and downstream fining data indicating the latter to be the more important variable. River incision into bedrock is a topic of great interest to fluvial geomorphologists, although most data are derived from active tectonic settings. The incision of a large river into a plateau surface is relatively rare, the best known example being the Colorado River in the young (6 Ma) Grand Canyon. The Orange River {{in the study area}} represents a long-lived example of this setting, with the present day dissected topography having evolved from more confined canyon-like walls following the early incision of the Orange River in the Early Tertiary. Although a long-lived incision, the modern channel is not graded in the study area, and is actively incising. The world-wide dataset of incision rates in modern rivers indicates that the Orange River could have completed its entire incision within less than a million years. The continued downcutting of this river so long after the initial incision event is indicative of the roles of intermittent, ongoing <b>epeirogenesis</b> and/or eustatic influences (both of which cannot be proven at this stage), tributary input from the plateau rim (Great Escarpment) or merely the long tag time involved in landscape adjustment following incision into a plateau surface.

40|$|Lateritisation is {{associated}} with tropical climates and geomorphic conditions of peneplanation where hydromorphic processes of weathering predominate. Laterites are products of relative (residual) and absolute(chemical) accumulation after leaching of mobile constituents. Their major element chemistry {{is controlled by the}} aluminous character of bedrock and drainage. Bauxitisation is characterised by residual gibbsite neoformation and lateritisation, by both residual accumulation and hydromorphic precipitation of goethite controlled by the redox front at the water table. The laterite forms part of a weathering profile that is underlain by saprock, saprolite, the mottled zone and overlain by a soil horizon. The secondary gold in laterites has its source invariably with mineralised bedrock. The distribution of secondary gold is controlled by mechanical eluviation and hydromorphic processes governed by organic, thiosulphate and chloride complexing. The precipitation of secondary gold is controlled by pH conditions, stability of the complexing agent and ferrolysis. Gold-bearing laterites are Cainozoic in age and are best developed on stable Archean and Proterozoic cratons that have suffered <b>epeirogenesis</b> since lateritisation. Mechanical eluviation increases in influence at the expense of hydromorphic processes as a positive function of topographic slope and degradation rate. Gradients greater than 10 ⁰ are not conducive for lateritisation, with latosols forming instead. High vertical degradation rates may lead to the development of stone lines. In the Western Australian case, post-laterite aridification has controlled the redistribution of secondary gold at levels marked by stabilisation of the receding palaeowater table. Mineable reserves of lateritic ore are located at Boddington, Westonia and Gibson toward the south-west of the Yilgarn Block. A significant controlling variable appears to be the concentration of chloride in the regolith. Based on the Boddington model, the laterite concentrates the following elements from bedrock gold lodes: i) Mo, Sb, W, Hg, Bi and Au as mobile constituents. ii) As and Pb as immobile constituents. Geochemical sampling of ferruginous lag after bedrock and laterite has provided dispersed anomalies that are easily identifiable. "Chalcophile corridors" up to 150 km in length are defined broadly by As and Sb but contain more discrete anomalies of Bi, Mo, Ag, Sn, W, Se or Au, in the Yilgarn Block. The nature of the weathered bedrock, the tabular distribution of secondary gold ore deposition and the infrastructural environment lends the lateritic regolith to low cost, open-cut mining. The western Australian lateritic-gold model perhaps can be adapted and modified for use elsewhere in the world. ...|$|E
40|$|Southern Africa's {{topography}} is distinctive. An inland plateau of low {{relief and}} high average elevation {{is separated from}} a coastal plane of high relief and low average elevation by a steeply dipping escarpment. The origin and evolution of this topography is poorly understood because, unlike high plateaus elsewhere, its development cannot be easily linked to present day compressional plate boundary processes. Understanding {{the development of this}} regional landscape since the break-up of Gondwana is a first order step towards resolving regional <b>epeirogenesis.</b> We present data that quantifies the timing and extent of exhumation across the southern Cape escarpment and coastal plane, using apatite fission track analysis (AFTA) of 25 outcrop samples and 31 samples from three deep boreholes (KW 1 / 67, SA 1 / 66, CR 1 / 68). Outcrop fission track (AFT) ages are Cretaceous and are significantly younger than the stratigraphic ages of their host rocks, indicating that the samples have experienced elevated paleotemperatures. Mean track lengths vary from 11. 86 to 14. 23 μm. The lack of Cenozoic apatite ages suggests that major cooling was over by the end Cretaceous. The results for three boreholes, situated seaward (south) of the escarpment, indicate an episode of increased denudation in the mid-late Cretaceous (100 – 80 Ma). An earlier episode of increased denudation (140 – 120 Ma) is identified from a borehole north of the escarpment. Thermal modelling indicates a history involving 2. 5 – 3. 5 km of denudation in the mid-late Cretaceous (100 – 80 Ma) at a rate of 175 to 125 m/Ma. The AFT data suggest that less than 1 km of overburden has been eroded regionally since the late Cretaceous (&# 60; 80 Ma) at a rate of 10 to 15 m/Ma, but do not discount the possibility of minor (in relative amplitude) episodes of uplift and river incision through the Cenozoic. The reasons for rapid denudation in these early and mid-Cretaceous episodes are less clear, but may be related to epeirogenic uplift associated with an increase in mantle buoyancy as reflected in two punctuated episodes of alkaline intrusions (e. g. kimberlites) across southern Africa and contemporaneous formation of two large mafic igneous provinces (~ 130 and 90 Ma) flanking its continental margins. Because Cenozoic denudation rates are relatively minimal, epeirogenic uplift of southern Africa and its distinct topography cannot be primarily related to Cenozoic mantle processes, consistent with the lack of any significant igneous activity across this region during that time...|$|E
40|$|Geographical Information Systems (GIS) employ very {{powerful}} data base management systems, which can acquire all kindsof {{data about the}} locations and includes all kinds of location related information. GIS {{at the same time}} can manipulate profiles,statistics, maps, 3 dimension views and different kinds of operational analysis as a system depending on basic scientific principlesof Geography. For these reasons GIS as a methodology, is handled as an infrastructure formative of Geography with a view toidentifying the physical geographical features. Owing to digitized terrain database “Digital Elevation Model” model of GIS, the elevation, slope, aspect properties of thereservoir are displayed. The boundaries of the carstic reservoir area are also identified as correct as possible. It has beendetermined that the area of the region from which Sorgun Stream and it’s branches collects water is around 500 sq km’s widewhich extends in the North - South direction. Whereby various analyses the different valley types within the reservoir, drainagepatterns, longitudinal and crosscut profiles of the watercourse, the lengths of the main river and branches are displayed. Therefore, it was designated that Sorgun Stream has a main river length of 79 km’s between it’s spring at 2350 meters altitude andit’s river mouth and has a total length of 966 km’s with all it’s branches. Effects of topography and geological structure in the formation of running water system and distribution of water resourcesare displayed. It has been determined that the sources of the surface waters of the reservoir are cosequent streams and theevolution of the watercourse network depends on and extends towards the areas of week soil structure. The watercourse settleditself on the structure formed different drainage systems. It has been determined that the difference in the drainage systems is dueto the change of the general slope of the area towards south-west direction with <b>epeirogenesis,</b> which was towards South directionbefore Tertiary. The effects of faults and lengths of drifting areas, characteristics of litolojik structure, footprint of mountainous, plateau, hillygrounds areas which were effective {{in the formation of the}} reservoir are also determined. The properties of butte, crest, amphitheatre formation, plain area, cliff, meander, shore topography, carstic area, doline, cave,travertine area, ground and plant characteristics, field, length, amount and assortments are determined. At the same time, theeffects of heights, slope, aspect properties, topography, geologic structure, hydrographical structure and climate are identified. The 8 km long straight coastline extends at the south of the reservoir in the north-east to south-west direction. The Plato seenat - 20 meters depth in the sea starts at a distance of 200 meters from the west side of river-mouth of the Sorgun Stream and Erdemli lowland. It has been observed that, with 326 sq km wide area the tertiary terrain puts forward the general character of the reservoirwhich is followed by 154 sq km wide Mesozoic terrain and 19. 3 sq km wide Quaternary terrain. Reservoir also contains 4 explicitfault and 3 drifting areas. Elevation of the reservoir varies from 0 m to 2420 m and % 70 of the reservoir area elevation is higher than 1250 m whichcorresponds to 343 sq km wide area. The distribution slope of the area of the reservoir varies as follows :- % 26 of area have a slope of 0 degree to 5 degrees- % 52 of area have a slope of 5 degrees to 20 degrees- % 14 of area have a slope of 20 degrees to 30 degrees- % 8 of area have a slope over 30 degrees. Depending on the formation of the reservoir, the aspect shows different characters at the east end west of the Sorgun Streamand the detailed topographic structure causes varying properties of aspect. At the entrance from the Erdemli Plain to main valley; first the gorge with hillsides of average 200 m high, then the canyonextending from north to south direction with hillsides lined off cornice and towards the interior “V” type valleys takes place. The forest area of the reservoir totals to around 351 sq km and alluvial and organic soil area totals to 2 sq km. Around 1 / 7 ofthe area of the reservoir extends without any soil on it. Slopes more than 30 degrees are very effective for hillside erosions andsuch hillsides forms around % 8 of the reservoir area. It has been observed that the characteristic plants of the Sorgun Stream reservoir are red pine (Pinus brutia), black pine (Pinusnigra), oak (Quercus), juniper (Juniperus sp.) and cedar (Cedrus libani). During this research study the inconsistencies between various data collected by the several Governmental institutions wasnoticed. For example, while the 2000 m elevated area laying at the west of the track extending from Geriz Yaylağı to KemerYaylağı, was shown as soilless area by General Directorate of Rural Services; the General Directorate of Forestry has describedthis area as the agricultural area. Furthermore, the General Directorate of Forestry described the areas of higher than 300 - 400 msteep cornice at valley hillsides as agricultural areas. One of the most interesting facts of the reservoir is that depending on the special topographic conditions the existence of themountain alders, “which are the characteristic plants of the Black Sea climate” at the southwest of the lower path. By means of this research the main features of the presented possibilities by the GIS methodology for the field of physicalgeography are determined; therefore the reality that “GIS and Geography are founded on common scientific bases” weredesignated. The reached conclusion was that, owing to the advanced technology of the GIS methodology the scientificgeographical information can easily be transferred to daily life and can be used as a living Geograph...|$|E
