40|$|This article {{examines}} the inter-sectoral linkages and imports of Malaysia using the input-output approach. The method employed here will {{be similar to the}} work of Achaya and Hazari (1973), where they differentiated between total and domestic linkages. A hypothesis is put forward stating that there will below rank correlation between the total and domestic linkages if the <b>import</b> <b>requirements</b> are relatively high. The results of the analyses suggest a distinct characteristic between the industries generating backward and forward linkages respectively. This study found that there is a high correlation between the total and net forward linkage, suggesting the low <b>import</b> <b>requirements</b> for those industries generating forward linkage. These are in contrast with the results found for those industries generating backward linkage, where the correlation between the total and net backward linkage is lower. This suggests that the <b>import</b> <b>requirements</b> for those indutries generating backward linkage are higher than those industries generating forward linkage...|$|R

From these extended concepts, {{we are able to}} quantify the direct and indirect <b>import</b> <b>requirements</b> and determine the decomposition factors that induce total <b>import</b> <b>requirements.</b> Along with domestic output multipliers, policy makers would be able to look into and consider the import multiplier as a key determinant in sectoral economic planning and policy formulation.

We also can run growth simulation to identify the distribution of trade gain as previously applied by Miyazawa, Hewings and other authors. Using trade flow data from 178 countries, and focusing on the big five ASEAN, we conform the most important role of Singapore and Malaysia in this region.

40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{surge in}} {{imports of goods}} and services without a concomitant surge in exports in Turkey deserves a sound explanation. The studies on the issue addressed increasing import dependency of the manufacturing sector in Turkey. This paper has attempted to scrutinize the reasons behind this phenomenon by looking not only at the manufacturing sector as the past studies did, but also at the other sectors of the economy. Using 1998 and 2002 Input -Output Tables, <b>import</b> <b>requirement</b> ratios have been calculated for 12 aggregate sectors. The results demonstrate that the contribution of the “wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and household goods” sector to the increasing import dependency, hence to significantly rising imports, is greater than that of the manufacturing sector.

Phosphate rock was abundant in the Soviet Union, but because extraction costs were high most of this mineral was imported from Morocco and Syria.|$|R
