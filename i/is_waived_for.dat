25|$|In November 2016 the European Commission {{proposed}} {{a system for}} an electronic authorisation of visa-exempt third country nationals called ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System). Under the proposal the ETIAS will be managed by the European Border and Coast Guard in cooperation with national authorities. Foreign visitors {{will be required to}} submit personal data in advance and pay a processing fee (fee <b>is</b> <b>waived</b> <b>for</b> children). Submitted applications will be processed automatically by checking against databases and watch lists and in case no issues appear the authorisation should be issued immediately. The authorisation request may be processed for up 72 hours in which case the applicant must be notified if the authorisation request was issued or refused or if additional information is required. In case the authorisation is refused the applicant will have the right of appeal in accordance with national law of the member state. The authorisation will be valid for five years. A travel authorisation with limited territorial validity may be issued only exceptionally. It is imagined as a system similar to the ESTA system of the United States and the ETA system of Canada. It is expected to enter into operation on 1 January 2020. The cost for developing ETIAS is estimated at EUR 212,1 million.|$|E
