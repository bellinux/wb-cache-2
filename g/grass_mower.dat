5000|$|In 2010 Vince {{became a}} major {{shareholder}} of Forest Green Rovers FC, and three months later was appointed club chairman. [...] In February 2011, Rovers players were banned from eating red meat for health reasons, and {{a few weeks later}} the sale of all red meat products was banned at the club's ground, leaving only vegetarian options and free-range poultry and fish from sustainable stocks. Vince has also introduced a number of different eco-friendly developments at the club including the installation of solar panels on its New Lawn home ground, the use of a solar-powered robot <b>grass</b> <b>mower,</b> and the creation of the world's first organic football pitch. In September 2015, Vince revealed Forest Green were using a player recruitment method similar to the 'Moneyball' model that had been initially used in baseball to sign players by using computer-generated analysis. In October 2015, Forest Green became the world's first all vegan football club.|$|E

The Percival Provost design is attributed to Millicer. In 1950 he migrated to Australia and became chief aerodynamicist at the Government Aircraft Factories (GAF), working on the Jindivik and the Malkara missile. With two colleagues he entered a design competition sponsored by the Royal Aero Club of London for a replacement aircraft for the de Havilland Chipmunk. The Millicer team beat 103 contestants and won the competition with a design that ultimately became the Victa Airtourer. After several years of production Victa Aviation sold the rights to a New Zealand company. Millicer also had developed a slightly larger 4 place aircraft known as the AirCruiser, with one prototype built at the Bankstown, New South Wales, Victa factory and first flown in 1966. A military trainer version of this was under development {{at the time of}} the closure of the Victa operation which was subsequently converted in NZ into the PAC CT/4 military trainer. His other inventions include a patent for the vortex flap and a suction <b>grass</b> <b>mower</b> (honored in the Sydney 2000 Olympics opening). He also published Aerodynamics for Soaring Pilots for the Gliding Club of Victoria.|$|E

40|$|Progress is {{constantly}} being made and new applications are constantly {{coming out in}} the area of field robotics. In this paper, a promising application of field robotics in football playing fields is introduced. An algorithmic approach for generating the way points required for the guidance of a GPS-based field robotic through a football playing field to automatically carry out periodical tasks such as cutting the grass field, pitch and line marking illustrations and lawn striping is represented. The manual operation of these tasks requires very skilful personnel able to work for long hours with very high concentration for the football yard to be compatible with standards of Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). In the other side, a GPS-based guided vehicle or robot with three implements; <b>grass</b> <b>mower,</b> lawn stripping roller and track marking illustrator is capable of working 24 h a day, in most weather and in harsh soil conditions without loss of quality. The proposed approach for the automatic operation of football playing fields requires no or very limited human intervention and therefore it saves numerous working hours and free a worker to focus on other tasks. An economic feasibility study showed that the proposed method is economically superimposing the current manual practices...|$|E

Key Words: Endophthalmitis, Pantoea species Endophthalmitis is an uncommon but potentially devastating complication of penetrating ocular injuries with retained intraocular foreign bodies (IOFBs) [1]. Retained IOFBs are associated with endophthalmitis in approximately 6. 9 to 30 % of cases [2 - 5]. Pantoea species is a Gram-negative aerobic bacillus in the family Enterobacteriaceae. All species of the genus Pantoea can be isolated from feculent material, plants, and soil, {{where they can be}} either pathogens or commensals. Pantoea agglomerans (P. agglomerans synonyms, Erwinia herbicola, Enterobacter agglomerans) and other Pantoea species cause infections in humans and are also pathogenic to plants. P. agglomerans was most associated with penetrating trauma by vegetative material and catheter-related bacteremia [6 - 8].

50|$|Hover mowers are powered rotary push {{lawn mowers}} that use an {{impeller}} above the spinning blades to drive air downward, thereby creating an air cushion that lifts the mower above the ground. The operator can then easily move the mower as it floats over the <b>grass.</b> Hover <b>mowers</b> are necessarily light {{in order to}} achieve the air cushion and typically have plastic bodies with an electric motor. The most significant disadvantage, however, is the cumbersome usability in rough terrain or on the edges of lawns, as the lifting air-cushion is destroyed by wide gaps between the chassis and the ground. Hover mowers are built to operate on steep slopes, waterfronts, and high-weeded areas, so they are often used by golf course greenskeepers and commercial landscapers. Grass collection is often available, but can be poor in some models. The quality of cut can be inferior if the grass is pushed away from the blade by the cushion of air.|$|R

40|$|The {{vibration}} isolation efficiency of seating has been evaluated in 100 work vehicles in 14 categories (cars, vans, lift trucks, lorries, tractors, buses, dumpers, excavators, helicopters, armoured vehicles, mobile cranes, <b>grass</b> rollers, <b>mowers</b> and milk floats). Seat isolation efficiency, {{expressed by the}} SEAT value, was determined for all seats (67 conventional seats and 33 suspension seats) from the vertical acceleration measured on the floors and on the seats of the vehicles. For most categories of vehicle, the average SEAT value was less than 100 %, indicating that the average seat provided some attenuation of vibration. However, there were large variations in SEAT values between vehicles within categories. Two alternative vibration frequency weightings (Wb from BS 6841, 1987; Wk from ISO 2631, 1997) yielded SEAT values that differed by less than 6 %. Overall, the SEAT values determined by two alternative methods (the ratio of r. m. s. values and the ratio of vibration dose values) differed by less than 4 · 5 % when using weighting Wb, although larger differences may be expected in some situations. The median SEAT value for the suspension seats was 84 · 6 %; the median SEAT value for the conventional seats was 86 · 9 % (based on weighting Wb and the ratio of r. m. s. values). Predicted SEAT values were obtained assuming that each seat could be interchanged between vehicles without altering its transmissibility. The calculations suggest that 94 % of the vehicles investigated might benefit from changing the current seat to a seat {{from one of the}} other vehicles investigated. Although the predictions are based on assumptions that will not always apply, it is concluded that the severity of whole-body vibration exposures in many work environments can be lessened by improvements to seating dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Nineteen cool season grass cultivars were {{selected}} for further field evaluation in 2006, based upon their potential to overwinter well in the Northeast and to tolerate stressful production site conditions. We were particularly interested in their winter hardiness, and ability to rapidly establish a dense stand and suppress annual and perennial weeds under minimal maintenance, simulating conditions encountered in low maintenance production sites. Grasses were seeded on September 10, 2005 at 4 lbs/ 1000 sq ft on a well-drained Hudson silt loam soil in Ithaca NY, at the Bluegrass Lane Turf and Landscape Research Center. Plots were evaluated in April 2006 for winter hardiness and survival, and later in May, June and July 2006 {{for their ability to}} produce cover or above-ground biomass, and also to suppress the establishment of weeds. Plots received no fertilization and no irrigation after seeding, and minimal monthly mowing with a large commercial rotary <b>mower.</b> <b>Grasses</b> which performed exceptionally well in terms of weed suppression and biomass production included crested wheatgrass, creeping meadowgrass, no-mow fescue, Rebel Exceda tall fescue, Tar Hill II tall fescue, and Russian winter rye. Columbra and Intrigue chewings fescue and Palmer perennial ryegrass were also good performers. These cultivars generally produced greater than 80 to 90 % stands of cover with minimal weed infestation by July 10, 2006 and continued to perform well into the fall of 2006. Grasses which performed poorly as evaluated by formation of less than 60 % stands and supported large weed infestations included redtop, and Arizona fescue. Grasses will be further evaluated for their ability to withstand environmental stress and perform under low maintenance conditions both in Ithaca and Riverhead NY locations. In additional studies performed at Marcus Nurseries in Allegheny County, several groundcovers proved to be exceptional performers in nursery settings, 2 years after establishment. These groundcovers established and overwintered effectively, and were significantly weed suppressive. They also had no deleterious effects on growth of Frazier fir seedlings transplanted into killed groundcover strips. Best cover crop performers in nursery settings included Intrigue and Wilma fine fescue, and white clover/fine fescue mixtures. Palmer and Prelude perennial ryegrass provided poor weed suppression, despite good initial establishment. Fine fescues were generally most weed suppressive compared to all other groundcovers evaluated and required limited mowing for maintenance...|$|R
