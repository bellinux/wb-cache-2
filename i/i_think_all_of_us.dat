In response to questions by The Times about his 1973 statement, Huhne responded: [...] "To be honest I don't have any memory of it", saying that he was entitled to a private life before politics. In an interview published on the Kent News website on 10 November 2007, Huhne said: [...] "I clearly regret the views and I don't agree with those views at all. I was a teenager and I'm now 53 and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> do tend to move on in life." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 31, {{just hours}} {{prior to the}} {{announcement}} of Castro's condition, U.S. President George W. Bush told WAQI-AM, a Spanish-language radio station in Miami, [...] "If Fidel Castro were to move on because of natural causes, we've got a plan in place {{to help the people}} of Cuba understand there's a better way than the system in which they've been living under. No one knows when Fidel Castro will move on. In my judgment, that's the work of the Almighty." [...] On August 2, Senator Robert Bennett (R-Utah) said President Bush told him the administration was surprised by the announcement of Castro's illness, [...] "The president's comment was that everybody was caught by surprise, and we'll {{have to wait and see}} what U.S. action is necessary. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can say we had no idea this was coming." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2009, Carter said {{he could}} not [...] "ensure" [...] another movie would be made, but thought the {{international}} box office for the 2008 film made it at least a theoretical possibility. In an interview published in August 2012, Spotnitz said he was talking up the idea of an X-Files movie every chance he got, but that there was still nothing happening on that front, and that time was running very short for a third movie concluding the original X-Files franchise to be made at all. [...] He blamed the poor performance of the 2008 film on {{the fact that it was}} not about aliens. Speaking at San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2013, Carter, when asked about a third film, was extremely non-committal, indicating there was still no forward movement, and saying, [...] "We can get to it later." [...] On August 2013, Carter said, in an interview with Empire, that [...] "It's really up to 20th Century Fox, whether they have the will to do it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are interested in putting the band back together", adding that a third installment would be a return to the mythology and that the colonisation date of the television series would not be ignored.|$|E

25|$|This president, by {{engaging}} in such incredible abuses of power, breaches of trust with both the Congress and the American people, and misleading us into this tragic and unbelievable war, the violation of treaties, other international law, our constitution, our own domestic laws, and then his role in heinous human rights abuses; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> that together calls for impeachment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, these pranks {{around the}} farm {{have got to}} stop. You'll have your {{grandfather}} and Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha all upset, {{not to say anything}} about your sisters and your mothers. It's a fortunate thing that they went down to the town to do some shopping. Otherwise <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> you would be in for quite some punishment." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{respected}} Navvy for {{his good}} humor, {{and especially when}} {{he walked up to}} Marc, and with no show of the mean Indian, patted the glossy neck and then nimbly remounted. Marc, not being so difficult to please as Jim in the way of discomfiting the Navajo, appeared satisfied for the present, and trotted off down the hollow, with the string of horses ahead, their bells jingling.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{the present}} {{you may think}} so, dear; but you must {{remember}} that {{up to the present}} time it has turned out well. I know that your uncle did not like it at first, but I think that he passed ten happy years here. It gave him a great power for doing good, and he worthily availed himself of it. We have all spent a happy time; he was universally liked and respected. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have benefited by it. It would not have been half as pleasant if it had been known that you, my child, were the real owner of the estate, and he was acting merely as your guardian. Let us hope that everything will turn out as well in future. Colonel Thorndyke {{told me that he had}} left a considerable sum in addition to the estates, and that this was to be divided between you and Mark; so you see your cousin will not go out into the world a beggar." ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{almost three}} decades of rejecting offers for their work to be reissued, the band agreed to the US re-release of 'Where's Julie' (as a vinyl single) with release {{anticipated}} {{towards the end of}} 2014/early 2015. ('There have been countless offers over the years to do something, but it's gone, it's done. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> continue to create music, but it has always been a case of looking forward, not back.') ...|$|E

"Well, itwell, {{whatever}} it was, it was excusable, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>All</b> <b>of</b> {{you have learned}} how to behave in hot hand-to-hand engagements, and you don't need to be ashamed of your record in that matter; but to walk along in front of death, with one's hands idle, and no noise, no music, and nothing going on, is a very trying situation.

All we need is Ritchie to say, 'Let's go!' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> feel under pressure, because of the fans' expectations.

5000|$|The {{band was}} never entirely {{convinced}} that Arden had paid them everything he owed them. Kenney Jones has mixed {{memories of the}} band's stormy relationship with Arden: [...] Without Don, the Small Faces may not have existed, without his sort of vision at that time, be it short-lived or what. The fact is we became known {{and we got a}} break through Don. So if you think of it like that and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are prepared to swallow what went on, leave it, fine, it's history. We all learned from each other, he gave us our first break, fine, fair enough, you know, leave it. I've got good and bad memories but mainly I think of Don with affection, surprisingly enough.|$|E

It had one string that was a mile off the fingerboard. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> instrument makers have {{had that kind of}} fascination - some little spark, back at the very beginning."

In {{an article published}} in a 2004 issue of Maclean's, Steve Burgess criticized the film as an ethnocentric [...] "compendium of unpleasant stereotypes ... indicative of the way visitors and foreign workers often view Japan." [...] Robin Antepara, an educator writing for an issue of Commonweal, wrote that while the story embodies stereotypes, [...] "Charlotte is the personification of Japanese watchfulness," [...] an often neglected virtue. The academic Maria San Filippo wrote that the [...] "retreat into America-centrism would be disappointing if, again, it were not so truthful ... Coppola knows firsthand that American tourists rarely get to know any Japanese well enough to discover their depth as sympathetic human beings." [...] Katz responded to some of the criticism by saying [...] "Sofia's love of Japan and love of the people that she's met there is incredibly evident in the film... Literally, we recounted experiences that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had gone through," [...] and that none of the scenes were [...] "any slight to Japanese people." ...|$|E

Stories spread that there was a secret agenda to his meetings with Iranian officials, involving claims that he came to convey messages from the United States and then to relay Iran's response to White House officials. On 5 September 2013, In an exchange prompted by his Rosh Hashanah greeting on twitter, Zarif said that Iran does not deny the Holocaust, distancing the government from the often belligerent stances by former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Genuineness of Zarif's tweeting in English was confirmed by CNN's Christiane Amanpour. On 27 September 2013, he met with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry during P5+1 and Iran summit. It was the highest-level direct contact between the United States and Iran in the last six years. After the meeting, Kerry said that [...] "We had a constructive meeting, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were pleased that Foreign Minister Zarif came and made a presentation to us, which was very different in tone and very different in the vision that he held out with respect to possibilities of the future." ...|$|E
