25|$|By 1895, steel had {{replaced}} cast iron as skyscrapers' structural material. Its malleability {{allowed it to}} be formed {{into a variety of}} shapes, and it could be riveted, ensuring strong connections. The simplicity of a steel frame eliminated the inefficient part of a shear wall, the central portion, and consolidated support members in a much stronger fashion by allowing both horizontal and vertical supports throughout. Among steel's drawbacks is that as more material must be supported as height increases, the distance between supporting members must decrease, which in turn increases the amount of material that must be supported. This becomes inefficient and uneconomic for buildings above 40 stories tall as usable <b>floor</b> <b>spaces</b> are reduced for supporting column and due to more usage of steel.|$|E

40|$|Residential {{buildings}} {{are a key}} driver of energy consumption and also impact transportation and land-use. Energy consumption in the residential sector accounts for one-fifth of total U. S. energy consumption and energy-related CO 2 emissions, with <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> a major driver of building energy demands. In this work a consistent, vintage-disaggregated, annual long-term series of U. S. housing stock and residential <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> for 1891 - 2010 is presented. An {{attempt was made to}} minimize the effects of the incompleteness and inconsistencies present in the national housing survey data. Over the 1891 - 2010 period, <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> increased almost tenfold, from approximately 24, 700 to 235, 150 million square feet, corresponding to a doubling of <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> per capita from approximately 400 to 800 square feet. While population increased five times over the period, a 50 % decrease in household size contributed towards a tenfold {{increase in the number of}} housing units and <b>floor</b> <b>space,</b> while average <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> per unit remains surprisingly constant, as a result of housing retirement dynamics. In the last 30 years, however, these trends appear to be changing, as household size shows signs of leveling off, or even increasing again, while average <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> per unit has been increasing. GDP and total <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> show a remarkably constant growth trend over the period and total residential sector primary energy consumption and <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> show a similar growth trend over the last 60 years, decoupling only within the last decade...|$|R
50|$|The Governor's Palace, called Casa Gobierno under Spanish rule, was reconstructed in 1885 {{to replace}} the {{original}} structure built in 1736.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{one method}} of modeling {{current and future}} market penetration of advanced lighting controls {{as a function of}} commercial <b>floor</b> <b>space.</b> We take advanced lighting controls to mean dimmers, photosensors, occupancy or motion sensors, multi-step switches, and timers. We initialize the model with commercial <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> data from the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey, accounting for renovation, demolition, and region. The <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> is then associated with the building code that was in effect during the construction or renovation year, providing a link between existing commercial <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> and its coverage by advanced lighting controls. We make assumptions about demolition, renovation, and compliance rates. We find that mandating full compliance with the current Federal building code would increase commercial <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> with automatic lighting shutoff from 78 % to 90 %...|$|R

50|$|Cast-iron columns enabled architects {{to build}} tall {{buildings}} without the enormously thick walls required to construct masonry buildings of any height. Such flexibility allowed tall buildings to have large windows. In urban centres like SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District in New York City, manufacturing buildings and early department stores were built with cast-iron columns to allow daylight to enter. Slender cast-iron columns could also support the weight {{that would otherwise}} require thick masonry columns or piers, opening up <b>floor</b> <b>spaces</b> in factories, and sight lines in churches and auditoriums. The historic Iron Building in Watervliet, New York, is a cast-iron building.|$|E
50|$|Acquisition of the land, and the {{construction}} of the building were authorized by town meeting in 1907. The building was completed in 1909 to a design by Rutland architect Charles Paige, at a total cost of about $30,000. The ground <b>floor</b> <b>spaces,</b> now partly filled with municipal offices, originally housed the town clerk, public library, and classrooms for both elementary and high school grades. The upstairs auditorium over time was put to multiple uses, including town meetings, dances and other social events, and political rallies. It was closed in the 1970s, when such events were moved to a newer school auditorium.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} was erected in 1803 for the New Hampshire Bank after a house which was serving as its office {{burned in the}} great fire of 1802. New Hampshire Bank, chartered in 1792, was the first bank in the state. The building's ground <b>floor</b> <b>spaces</b> were occupied by a succession of banking interests, including two different banks beginning with the 1869 partition. Among those occupying offices {{on the second floor}} were New Hampshire Governor Levi Woodbury, his pupil, later President, Franklin Pierce, and New Hampshire Attorney General Jeremiah Mason.

50|$|Since a catwalk {{is usually}} placed {{high above the}} <b>floor,</b> <b>spaces</b> where {{lighting}} instruments can go are usually chained or otherwise blocked off when a light is not present to prevent people and/or objects from falling through. The instruments themselves are attached by a safety chain {{to prevent them from}} falling. Technicians normally attach objects (such as wrenches) to themselves before going onto the catwalk, so that such objects cannot fall and possibly injure someone or damage something. This also prevents objects from falling into a place where they cannot be retrieved, such as between the catwalk floor and the ceiling, or into an HVAC vent.|$|E
50|$|The classic {{concept of}} a {{skyscraper}} is a large steel box with many small boxes inside it. By eliminating the inefficient part of a shear wall, the central portion, and consolidating support members in a much stronger material, steel, a skyscraper could be built with both horizontal and vertical supports throughout. This method, though simple, has drawbacks. Chief among these is that as more material must be supported (as height increases), the distance between supporting members must decrease, which actually, in turn, increases the amount of material that must be supported. This becomes inefficient and uneconomic for buildings above 40 stories tall as usable <b>floor</b> <b>spaces</b> are reduced for supporting column and due to more usage of steel.|$|E

The oldest portion of the structure is 2-1/2 stories in height, built out of coursed rubble limestone joined with lime mortar. It is set on sloping land, which provides for banked entrances on the ground level and second floor. Window placement is irregular, and the multiple entrances serve different functional purposes. The ground <b>floor</b> <b>spaces</b> originally had dirt floors and were treated as a work space even in the house's early days, while the upper level had a living space with three rooms, serving as kitchen, parlor, and bedchamber.
