5|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} tests (NAATs), direct <b>fluorescein</b> tests (DFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) {{are highly}} sensitive tests that can identify specific pathogens present. Serology testing for antibodies {{is not as}} useful since {{the presence of the}} microorganisms in healthy people can confound interpreting the antibody titer levels, although antibody levels can indicate whether an infection is recent or long-term.|$|E
5|$|Other {{laboratory}} abnormalities {{may suggest}} poisoning, especially {{the presence of}} a metabolic acidosis, particularly if it is characterized by a large anion gap. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of poisoning. However, acidosis has a large number of differential diagnosis, including poisoning from methanol, salicylates, iron, isoniazid, paracetamol, theophylline, or from conditions such as uremia or diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any patient with a severe acidosis. Urine microscopy can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning. Finally, many commercial radiator antifreeze products have <b>fluorescein</b> added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a Wood's lamp. Following ingestion of antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol and <b>fluorescein,</b> a Wood's lamp may reveal fluorescence of a patient’s mouth area, clothing, vomitus, or urine which can help to diagnose poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Formation of the {{complexes}} of {{the type}} Cm(n-C3H7-BTP)3, where BTP stands for 2,6-di(1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)pyridine, in solutions containing n-C3H7-BTP and Cm3+ ions has been confirmed by EXAFS. Some of these BTP-type complexes selectively interact with curium and therefore are useful in its selective separation from lanthanides and another actinides. Dissolved Cm3+ ions bind with many organic compounds, such as hydroxamic acid, urea, <b>fluorescein</b> and adenosine triphosphate. Many of these compounds are related to biological activity of various microorganisms. The resulting complexes exhibit strong yellow-orange emission under UV light excitation, which is convenient not only for their detection, but also for studying the interactions between the Cm3+ ion and the ligands via changes in the half-life (of the order ~0.1 ms) and spectrum of the fluorescence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluorescein</b> is a {{fluorophore}} {{commonly used}} in microscopy, in a type of dye laser as the gain medium, in forensics and serology to detect latent blood stains, and in dye tracing. <b>Fluorescein</b> has an absorption maximum at 494nm and emission maximum of 512nm (in water). The major derivatives are <b>fluorescein</b> isothiocyanate (FITC) and, in oligonucleotide synthesis, 6-FAM phosphoramidite.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous or oral <b>fluorescein</b> {{is used in}} <b>fluorescein</b> {{angiography}} {{in research}} and to diagnose and categorize vascular disorders including retinal disease macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, inflammatory intraocular conditions, and intraocular tumors. It is also being used increasingly during surgery for brain tumors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluorescein</b> has a pKa of 6.4, and its {{ionization}} equilibrium {{leads to}} pH-dependent absorption and emission {{over the range}} of 5 to 9. Also, the fluorescence lifetimes of the protonated and deprotonated forms of <b>fluorescein</b> are approximately 3 and 4ns, which allows for pH determination from nonintensity based measurements. The lifetimes can be recovered using time-correlated single photon counting or phase-modulation fluorimetry.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluorescein</b> has an isosbestic point (equal {{absorption}} for all pH values) at 460nm.|$|E
25|$|The {{color of}} its aqueous {{solution}} varies from green to orange {{as a function}} of the way it is observed: by reflection or by transmission, as can be noticed in bubble levels, for example, in which <b>fluorescein</b> is added as a colorant to the alcohol filling the tube in order to increase the visibility of the air bubble contained within (thus enhancing the precision of the instrument). More concentrated solutions of <b>fluorescein</b> can even appear red.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent to}} which <b>fluorescein</b> dilaurate is broken down to yield lauric acid can be {{detected}} {{as a measure of}} pancreatic esterase activity.|$|E
25|$|A second {{method to}} prepare <b>fluorescein</b> uses methanesulfonic acid as a Brønsted acid catalyst. This route {{has a high}} yield under milder conditions.|$|E
25|$|Diluted <b>fluorescein</b> dye {{has been}} used to localise {{multiple}} muscular ventricular septal defects during open heart surgery and confirm the presence of any residual defects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluorescein</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} by Adolf von Baeyer in 1871. It {{can be prepared}} from phthalic anhydride and resorcinol {{in the presence of}} zinc chloride via the Friedel-Crafts reaction.|$|E
25|$|Topical, oral, and {{intravenous}} use of <b>fluorescein</b> can cause adverse reactions, including nausea, vomiting, hives, acute hypotension, anaphylaxis and related anaphylactoid reaction, causing cardiac arrest and {{sudden death due to}} anaphylactic shock.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluorescein</b> is a {{manufactured}} {{organic compound}} and dye. It is {{available as a}} dark orange/red powder slightly soluble in water and alcohol. It is widely used as a fluorescent tracer for many applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{tradition}} of dyeing the river green arose by accident when plumbers used <b>fluorescein</b> dye to trace sources of illegal pollution discharges. The dyeing {{of the river}} is still sponsored by the local plumbers union.|$|E
25|$|Aprotinin can be {{labelled}} with <b>fluorescein</b> isothiocyanate. The conjugate {{retains its}} antiproteolytic and carbohydrate-binding properties {{and has been}} used as a fluorescent histochemical reagent for staining glycoconjugates (mucosubstances) that are rich in uronic or sialic acids.|$|E
25|$|Other uses of <b>fluorescein</b> include {{using it}} as a {{water-soluble}} dye added to rainwater in environmental testing simulations to aid in locating and analyzing any water leaks, and in Australia and New Zealand as a methylated spirit dye.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluorescein</b> dye solutions, {{typically}} 15% active, {{are commonly}} used {{as an aid to}} leak detection during hydrostatic testing of subsea oil and gas pipelines and other subsea infrastructure. Leaks can be detected by divers carrying ultraviolet lights.|$|E
25|$|A Wood's lamp {{may be used}} {{to rapidly}} assess whether an {{individual}} is suffering from ethylene glycol poisoning as a consequence of antifreeze ingestion. Manufacturers of ethylene glycol-containing antifreezes commonly add <b>fluorescein,</b> which causes the patient's urine to fluoresce under Wood's lamp.|$|E
25|$|One of {{its more}} {{recognizable}} uses was in the Chicago River, where <b>fluorescein</b> was the first substance used to dye the river green on St. Patrick's Day in 1962. In 1966, environmentalists forced a change to a vegetable-based dye to protect local wildlife.|$|E
25|$|Related to {{the latter}} is the {{classical}} preparation of the dye <b>fluorescein</b> from phthalic anhydride and resorcinol, which involves a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This transformation has in fact been accomplished using even the hydrated ZnCl2 sample shown in the picture above.|$|E
25|$|Fingerprints can be visualized with {{fluorescent}} compounds such as ninhydrin or DFO (1,8-Diazafluoren-9-one). Blood {{and other}} substances are sometimes detected by fluorescent reagents, like <b>fluorescein.</b> Fibers, {{and other materials}} that may be encountered in forensics or with a relationship to various collectibles, are sometimes fluorescent.|$|E
25|$|The retinal {{changes are}} easily {{identified}} by ophthalmoscopy, which is performed under general anesthesia {{if the child}} is very young. The abnormal vessels are even better seen with <b>fluorescein</b> angiography. In advanced disease, glaucoma is diagnosed by measuring intraocular pressure and cataract by using slit lamp biomicroscopy.|$|E
25|$|There {{have only}} been 52 {{reported}} cases of patients with Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome as of 2012. Symptoms are rarely noticed in children and the syndrome is often diagnosed in late childhood or early adulthood when visual impairment is noticed. <b>Fluorescein</b> angiography is commonly used to diagnose the syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Diabetic {{retinopathy}} {{is diagnosed}} entirely by recognizing abnormalities on retinal images taken by fundoscopy. Color fundus photography is mainly used for staging the disease. <b>Fluorescein</b> angiography {{is used to}} assess the extent of retinopathy that aids in treatment plan development. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is used to determine the severity of edema and treatment response.|$|E
25|$|In 1957 {{the family}} emigrated to New Zealand where Knight {{took up the}} {{position}} of director of the medical photographic unit of the Otago Medical School and Dunedin Public Hospital. In 1965 he {{was elected president of}} the New Zealand Institute of Medical Photographers. Techniques of <b>fluorescein</b> angiography developed by Knight won international acclaim.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{examinations}} {{can be used}} {{to determine the extent of}} the syndrome and its severity. <b>Fluorescein</b> angiography is quite useful in diagnosing the disease, and the use of ultrasonography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are helpful in confirming the disease. Neuro-ophthalmic examinations reveal pupillary defects (see Marcus Gunn Pupil). Funduscopic examinations, examinations of the fundus of the eye, allow detection of arteriovenous malformations. Neurological examinations can determine hemiparesis and paresthesias. Malformations in arteriovenous connections and irregular functions in the veins may be distinguished by <b>fluorescein</b> angiographies. Cerebral angiography examinations may expose AVMs in the cerebrum. MRIs are also used in imaging the brain and can allow visualization of the optic nerve and any possible atrophy. MRI, CT, and cerebral angiography are all useful for investigating the extent and location of any vascular lesions that are affecting the brain. This is helpful in determining the extent of the syndrome.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, German aircrew carried small {{containers}} of <b>fluorescein.</b> In {{the event of}} parachuting into the sea after being shot down, the dye would be released into the water. This produced a vivid marking {{that could be seen}} from the air over long distances and aided the air-sea rescue of the downed crew. This was later adopted by other air forces.|$|E
25|$|This {{method is}} of {{critical}} importance in the modern life sciences, {{as it can be}} extremely sensitive, allowing the detection of single molecules. Many different fluorescent dyes can be used to stain different structures or chemical compounds. One particularly powerful method is the combination of antibodies coupled to a fluorophore as in immunostaining. Examples of commonly used fluorophores are <b>fluorescein</b> or rhodamine.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis {{is through}} direct {{observation}} of the ulcer {{with the use of}} <b>fluorescein</b> stain, which is taken up by exposed corneal stroma and appears green (see photos above and below). With descemetoceles, Descemet's membrane will bulge forward and after staining will appear as a dark circle with a green boundary, because it does not absorb the stain. Other tests that may be necessary include a Schirmer's test for keratoconjunctivitis sicca and an analysis of facial nerve function for facial nerve paralysis.|$|E
25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) outlawed {{the use of}} <b>fluorescein</b> {{for this}} purpose, since it was shown to be harmful to the river. The parade {{committee}} has since switched to a mix involving forty pounds of powdered vegetable dye. Though the committee closely guards the exact formula, they insist {{that it has been}} tested and verified safe for the environment. Furthermore, since the environmental organization Friends of the Chicago River believes the dye is probably not harmful, they do not oppose the practice.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} stage which is called non-proliferative {{diabetic}} retinopathy (NPDR) there are no symptoms, the signs are not visible to the eye and patients will have 20/20 vision. The only way to detect NPDR is by fundus photography, in which microaneurysms (microscopic blood-filled bulges in the artery walls) can be seen. If there is reduced vision, <b>fluorescein</b> angiography {{can be done to}} see the back of the eye. Narrowing or blocked retinal blood vessels can be seen clearly and this is called retinal ischemia (lack of blood flow).|$|E
25|$|All {{automotive}} antifreeze formulations, {{including the}} newer organic acid (OAT antifreeze) formulations, are environmentally hazardous {{because of the}} blend of additives (around 5%), including lubricants, buffers and corrosion inhibitors. Because the additives in antifreeze are proprietary, the safety data sheets (SDS) provided by the manufacturer list only those compounds which {{are considered to be}} significant safety hazards when used in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Common additives include sodium silicate, disodium phosphate, sodium molybdate, sodium borate, denatonium benzoate and dextrin (hydroxyethyl starch). Disodium <b>fluorescein</b> dyes are added to antifreeze to help trace the source of leaks, and as an identifier since some different formulations are incompatible.|$|E
25|$|The Luftwaffe {{was much}} better {{prepared}} for the task of air-sea rescue than the RAF, specifically tasking the Seenotdienst unit, equipped with about 30 Heinkel He 59 floatplanes, with picking up downed aircrew from the North Sea, English Channel and the Dover Straits. In addition, Luftwaffe aircraft were equipped with life rafts and the aircrew were provided with sachets of a chemical called <b>fluorescein</b> which, on reacting with water, created a large, easy-to-see, bright green patch. In accordance with the Geneva Convention, the He 59s were unarmed and painted white with civilian registration markings and red crosses. Nevertheless, RAF aircraft attacked these aircraft, as some were escorted by Bf 109s.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} in the industrial applications section above, lanthanide metals are particularly useful in technologies that {{take advantage of their}} reactivity to specific wavelengths of light. Certain life science applications take advantage of the unique luminescence properties of lanthanide ion complexes (Ln(III) chelates or cryptates). These are well-suited for this application due to their large Stokes shifts and extremely long emission lifetimes (from microseconds to milliseconds) compared to more traditional fluorophores (e.g., <b>fluorescein,</b> allophycocyanin, phycoerythrin, and rhodamine). The biological fluids or serum commonly used in these research applications contain many compounds and proteins which are naturally fluorescent. Therefore, the use of conventional, steady-state fluorescence measurement presents serious limitations in assay sensitivity. Long-lived fluorophores, such as lanthanides, combined with time-resolved detection (a delay between excitation and emission detection) minimizes prompt fluorescence interference.|$|E
25|$|Van Norren et al. (1998) {{could not}} find a single example in the medical {{literature}} of a <1nbsp&mW classnbsp&III laser causing eyesight damage. Mainster et al. (2003) provide one case, an 11-year-old child who temporarily damaged her eyesight by holding an approximately 5mW red laser pointer close to the eye and staring into the beam for 10 seconds, she experienced scotoma (a blind spot) but fully recovered after three months. Luttrull & Hallisey (1999) describe a similar case, a 34-year-old male who stared into the beam of a classIIIa 5mW red laser for 30 to 60 seconds, causing temporary central scotoma and visual field loss. His eyesight fully recovered within two days, {{at the time of his}} eye exam. An intravenous fundus <b>fluorescein</b> angiogram, a technique used by ophthalmologists to visualise the retina of the eye in fine detail, identified subtle discoloration of the fovea.|$|E
