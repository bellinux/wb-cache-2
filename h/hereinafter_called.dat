40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the uncertainty of}} ozone differential absorption lidar (DIAL) measurements due {{to the impact of}} background signal.

Analysis suggests that an appropriate return signal intensity ratio can make the impact of background signal very small, negligible. The simulations based on the analysis coincide with the experimental results. The experimental results show that the impact of background signal is negligible at an appropriate return signal inten-sity ratio of 0. 96 at wavelength pair (280, 285 nm). In case of unknown background intensity, we can adjust the laser pulse energy levels at the two wavelengths to obtain an appropriate return signal intensity ratio on the oscilloscope to suppress the impact of background signal and ensure the accuracy of night time ozone measurements...|$|R

40|$|When the {{collection}} of tax could be imperiled by going through the usual deficiency procedures, the IRS may make a jeopardy assessment or a termination assessment (<b>hereinafter</b> sometimes <b>called</b> “summary assessment”) and proceed immediately to collection. To prevent the misuse of this power, section 7429 provides affected taxpayers expedited administrative and judicial review. The IRS has made {{tens of thousands of}} jeopardy and termination assessments over the years, and there are hundreds of court decisions in litigated section 7429 cases. The unique nature of jeopardy and termination assessments makes section 7429 proceedings very different from typical tax litigation. This article addresses a significant difference – the extent to which taxpayers may be allowed discovery of the basis of the IRS’s summary assessment. Part I sets the context by describing jeopardy and termination assessments and section 7429 review. Part II examines a number of judicial decisions foundational to discovery incident to section 7429. Part III considers special factors that likely will incline a court to expand or contract discovery available to taxpayers in such cases. The conclusion that will emerge from these parts is that only limited discovery typically is permitted in section 7429 cases, although special factors may alter the permitted extent of discovery. This pattern deviates from the generally more liberal discovery usually available in federal district courts. Part IV asks whether such deviation is consistent with rules of civil procedure and concludes that it is...|$|R

If physical exercise is done in excess and unsystematic, it would trigger attack, while if it is done properly whether its type, intensity, and duration, it will be an important step in managing the disease. Clinical trial approach of phase I was used to study safe, effective, and comfortable movement for arthritis patients. Various movements advocated by some literatures were tested on seven patients, and the researcher selected the safe, on target, and comfortable movements for the patients.

40|$|Since the Independence of the Republic of Indonesia on 17 th August 1945, the Constitution of 1945 {{has become}} the highest written law in Indonesia. In Land law, the Act of No. 5 of 1960 (<b>hereinafter</b> is <b>called</b> UUPA) is {{applicable}} governing the land matters and agrarian reform. According to article 33 (2) of the 1945 Constitution the State has power to determine the right to control property, including the land. Besides, Article 2 of the UUPA stipulates the basic rules as {{to the relationship between}} the State power and the right holder of the land. Accordingly, the State recognizes the ownership of the land by an individual or by private legal entity and by public legal body in terms of right to use for the government body. The implementation {{of the power of the}} State to confer the right on land as property is mentioned in Article 16 UUPA namely the right of the land permanently or temporarily, and other rights as determined by the law in future. The right to use of land is not covered by Article 16 UUPA, but shall be governed by law. As far as the special right to land use is concerned it is laid down under Articles 41 and Article 42 and also in general explanation II/ 2 UUPA. It is therefore suggested that the State Authority should enact the Act to determine such right on grounds : firstly it is possible for the government to do so on the basis article 16 UUPA strictly but then the implementation of Article 16 UUPA has become unlimited. Secondly, there exists the vast power of the state, and thirdly, the legislations in Indonesia confers vast and unlimited power to State to control the land which might lead to the abuse of power by the State. The special right to use of land should cover many factors, namely : the right, content of right, the burden of land towards the other right of land, subject of right, and land as the object of right. While factors embodied in right of control of land consist of : ownership, transfer or right to other(s), deletion of right, and the proof of right.

This dissertation seeks to highlight that the subject matter has nowadays acquired undoubtful relevance and how the time is mature for a structural reform of the captioned discipline. This research project is, in particular, structured as follows: (i) an analysis of the historical genesis of the institute of OPG - since the ideological disputes of the mid nineteenth century to the so-called Gozzini Law 663 of October 10, 1986 - the consequences of problems that have given rise to changes in the regulation of the institutions involved and the subsequent discussions, (ii) analysis of constitutional law and the Supreme Court in respect of security measures and OPG, (iii) specific study of comparative profiles of the captioned matter and of the consequences of the adoption of the different measures and the situation of the institutions in various jurisdictions analyzed for the purpose of a better and more objective assessment of the Italian context; an interesting consideration is particularly dedicated to the analysis of the treatment of mentally disordered offenders in the legal system of England and Wales and to the analysis of data related to the population interned and structures of the mentioned territories dedicated to host such patients, (iv) analysis of the relationship between psychiatry and law, with particular attention to the psychiatric evaluation, of which is provided an analysis of the legal profiles, of the performance, the methods used for the assessment of mental illness and social danger and of the influence now exerted on decisions of the courts on the treatment of the mentally ill offenders, (v) portrait of the six OPG in the Italian territory, analysis of statistical data on population admitted to OPG in recent years - including the number of people interned there in recent years, the age and sex of the same, level of education, geographical area of origin, marital status and any number of children, length of stay, type of offense committed and suffered mental illness - and the staff working in OPG (vi) visits to the OPG of Castiglione, and analysis of data relating to the population of the same, the structure and internal organization of OPG, nurse engaged therein, treatment and other activities reserved for inmates, (vii) a summary of the issues and problems identified {{in the light of the}} various discussions developed in case law, criminal law doctrine and forensic psychiatry at national and European level, and the data collected in relation to the population interned and structures on the Italian territory. In the last part of this work the author has focused on the formulation of possible suggestions and proposals in relation to the legal concepts of imputability and social danger, as well as possible alternatives to the current system of safety features - also in relation to problematic categories such as alcoholics, chronic drug addicts and semi-mentally ill - and then browsed the reform proposals presented since now in the Italian Parliament. Finally, the author has turned her attention to recent regulatory changes since the enactment of Annex C to the DPCM April 1, 2008 to Art 3 -ter of Law in February 2012, n. 9 (so called "Emptying prisons"), concerning "Measures for the final overcoming of judicial psychiatric hospitals" and the consequent agreements in Joint Conference. Having highlighted the problems the institutions of imputability and of social dangerousness, the main aporias of the current system of security measures, the possible amendments to the same suggested by the doctrine, relevant case law, the various reform proposals and, most recently, the scope of the Law of February 17, 2012 n. 9, the research project suggests that, ultimately, a reform of the captioned matter in order to enable a treatment and intervention in the relevant fields more appropriate to the new choices of criminal policy, it is now improcrastinabile and necessary. ...|$|R

Therefore, the actual programming language of the implementation is also transparent, although this standard defines only C linkage semantics. The separation between SystemVerilog code and the foreign language is based on using functions as the natural encapsulation unit in SystemVerilog.
