500|$|The Jackson family (Sandi, Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr., and Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr.) have {{occasionally}} {{not seen}} {{eye to eye}} with Mayor Daley. [...] In fact, Congressman Jackson was considering contesting Daley for Mayor until the Democratic Party success in the 2006 fall elections made it clear he could be very productive by remaining in Congress because of his party's majority. [...] Sandi Jackson, who is credited with encouraging Jackson, Jr. to run for Congress, had been supportive of the idea of him running for mayor. William Beavers had been a longtime Daley ally.

500|$|Jackson is a {{martial arts}} enthusiast who {{practices}} kung fu, tae kwon do, and karate. On August 1, 2007, Jackson {{got into a}} verbal disagreement with Rep.

Jackson stated in floor debate that [...] "Republicans can't be trusted" [...] and Terry responded with [...] "shut up" [...] before approaching Jackson. Jackson then spoke profanities and challenged Terry to step outside, presumably for a physical fight. Steve Rothman helped avoid escalation to actual physical confrontation. Martial artists throughout the Omaha, Nebraska area (Terry's district) called to inquire about Jackson's mindset and intentions. [...] <b>Jackson</b> <b>says</b> Terry was the instigator. [...] Terry says Jackson was at fault, but the two shook hands {{the next day and}} agreed to move forward in the interest of their constituents. [...] However, a week later an unidentified man who claimed to be a Jackson relative walked into Terry's Omaha office saying he was Jackson's hitman who had come to beat up Terry, which led to FBI involvement. [...] Although the story was covered in the Washington Post and Omaha World-Herald, neither the Chicago Tribune nor the Chicago Sun-Times covered any part of the story.|$|E

[...] (in a later version of the spot, Jackson is shown playing the guitar expertly, after which an impressed Diddley says, [...] "Bo...you do know Diddley, don't you?")

2500|$|Jackson {{began to}} show his true {{potential}} in 1989, when he was voted to start for the American League All-Star team, and was named the game's MVP for his play on both offense and defense. In {{the top of the}} first inning, he caught Pedro Guerrero's 2-out line drive to left-center field to save two runs. Then he led off the bottom of the first—his first All-Star plate appearance—with a monstrous [...] home run off Rick Reuschel of the San Francisco Giants. NBC-TV announcer Vin Scully exclaimed, [...] "Look at that one! Bo <b>Jackson</b> <b>says</b> hello!" [...] Wade Boggs followed with his own home run, making them the first pair in All-Star history to lead off their sides first with back-to-back home runs. In the 2nd inning, he beat out the throw on a potential double play to drive in the eventual winning run. He then stole second base, making him the second player in All-Star Game history to hit a home run and steal a base in the same game (the first was Willie Mays). Jackson finished the game with two hits in four at-bats, one run scored, and two RBI.|$|E
2500|$|Alternate identities {{presented}} include [...] "Damita Jo", {{an aggressive}} persona mentioned during the album's title track and [...] "Sexhibition", and [...] "Strawberry", a lascivious performer who emerges on [...] "Strawberry Bounce". Speaking about the personae, Jackson said [...] "She's {{another way to}} express and expose a deeper part of me." [...] "Damita Jo" [...] is [...] "a lot harsher, and quick {{to put you in}} your place. She doesn't sit and ponder about stuff, where I'll go, 'Should I or shouldn't I?' She's tougher than I am. Then there's Strawberry. She's the most sexual of them all, the wildest." [...] Blender magazine commented the latter identity represents [...] "a time when she doesn't need to be the polite, professional Janet, and can turn into raw, unrestrained Strawberry." [...] Jackson added [...] "It's not an everyday indulgence. Not even every week. But every now and then I like playing around in that mode." [...] Jackson said the characters [...] "absolutely" [...] live inside of her, exclaiming [...] "it feels wonderful" [...] to release them. The concept is further explored in [...] "Looking for Love", in which <b>Jackson</b> <b>says</b> every individual is composed of [...] "many people rolled into one," [...] unified by a similar motive of seeking love, companionship, or identity. Jackson previously desired to record an album which was a [...] "complete departure" [...] from what she is known for and title it after her middle name, but was convinced to use the title for the album by producer Dallas Austin. The title was initially used as self-acceptance; saying [...] "My mother made up [...] "Damita." [...] I presumed [...] "Jo" [...] was for Joseph, my father, even though I later learned it wasn't. Because he was emotionally withdrawn, I was never comfortable using it. For years I didn't. Now I love being called Jo. I've come to the point where I'm trying to accept - even embrace - everything that has happened to me. I believe that without acceptance there's no serenity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Villa {{knew his}} only {{chance of getting}} into the fort was by {{utilizing}} some captured Carrancista artillery pieces. Gen. Angeles was put in command of this effort and had to move the artillery from their positions in Juarez to the fort outside [...] the town before beginning the attack (Byron <b>Jackson</b> <b>says</b> that Ángeles {{did not participate in}} this battle, but instead remained at Villa’s headquarters eight miles south [...] ) This took a while {{and by the time the}} task was finished Gen. Gonzalez had come up with a daring plan to use the majority of his cavalry and his infantry in a charge against Angeles' column as it approached the fort. The charge successfully routed Angeles and sent him fleeing back to Juarez, but the Villistas were able to hold onto the downtown area. Meanwhile, on the Texas side of the border, American soldiers were being targeted by Villista snipers who directed their fire towards the 82nd Field Artillery Regiment's headquarters at the El Paso Union Stockyards. Several American soldiers were wounded but the troops did not return fire. Additionally, two civilians had been killed and four more were wounded. The first, a man named Floyd Hinton, was killed while watching the fighting from his rooftop near the intersection of Ninth and El Paso streets. The second, a Mrs. Ed. Dominguez, was shot in the head while sitting on her doorstep at 309 East Eighth Street. The US government later conducted an investigation into which faction was responsible for the casualties and suggested that the Villistas were to blame. The Americans, under Brig. Gen. James B. Erwin, did not respond to the sniping until 10:35 pm when Pvt. Sam Tusco of the 82nd Field Artillery was killed and Pvt. Burchard F. Casey was severely wounded. At about 11:00 pm, after Gen. Erwin learned of the casualties, he sent 3,600 men across the Santa Fe Street bridge, over the Rio Grande, to stop the sniping and provide protection for American citizens there.|$|E
