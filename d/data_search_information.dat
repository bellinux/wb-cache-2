In theory, this model provides the opportunity to derive consumer preferences from <b>information</b> <b>search</b> alone. The model is then illustrated, based on an articial dataset. Estimation results show that <b>information</b> <b>search</b> concerning an uncertain attribute of a good can indeed be used to identify consumer preferences concerning the good.

40|$|ABSTRACT: While many {{data sets}} carry {{geographic}} and temporal references, {{our ability to}} analyze these datasets lags behind our ability to collect them because of the challenges posed by both data complexity and tool scalability issues. This study develops a visual analytics approach that leverages human expertise with visual, computational, and cartographic methods to support the application of visual analytics to relatively large spatio-temporal, multivariate data sets. We develop and apply {{a variety of methods}} for <b>data</b> clustering, pattern <b>searching,</b> <b>information</b> visualization, and synthesis. By combining both human and machine strengths, this approach has a better chance to discover novel, relevant, and potentially useful information that is difficult to detect by any of the methods used in isolation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by applying the Visual Inquiry Toolkit we developed to analyze a data set containing geographically referenced, time-varying and multivariate data for U.

40|$|International audienceThe {{vision of}} Internet of Things (IOT) {{promises}} a prosperous future for grain storage quality control by integrating all sensors {{deployed in the}} individual grain bins into a global grain storage system. However, since the data format and the data semantic of the monitoring systems are not unified, heterogeneous systems equipped with sensor networks are pending integration and have difficulty in semantic interoperation. In this paper, we design a semantic middleware to promote the data interoperability of different grain storage systems. The proposed semantic middleware uses a multi-layer architecture and provides four basic services: semantic mapping service, query service, publish service and ontology management service. Raw sensor data are converted to RDF format by semantic annotation. Semantic data are stored in the knowledge base and can be queried and reasoned. The semantic interoperation middleware will promote <b>data</b> interoperability, <b>information</b> <b>search</b> and retrieval, automatic inference and extendibility in the global grain storage internet...|$|R
40|$|Courts and {{commentators}} have {{struggled with the}} problem of cabining digital searches while still allowing law enforcement sufficient latitude to be efficient and effective. This Note examines current proposals, such as requiring search protocols or abandoning the plain view doctrine, before proposing a solution of its own: revisiting the constitutional requirement of particularity in the warrant. Focusing on particularity is not new; the problem is describing, ex ante, where to search within a corpus of seized data. The language of files and folders is both inadequate and incoherent for this task, but in rejecting it, courts have largely given up on particularly describing where in the <b>data</b> to <b>search.</b> <b>Data</b> is <b>information,</b> and information has meaning—semantics. Computers are increasingly able to sort and segregate data according to the human meaning it represents. Accordingly, magistrate judges can describe, ex ante in natural language, the type of data that examiners may search based on the evidence sought. Forensic examiners can then use automated tools to retrieve information responsive to that semantic description without searching the entirety of the data. Thus, the privacy of suspects, guilty and innocent, can be protected without giving up the plain view doctrine or compromising effective law enforcement...|$|R

Our techniques provide a complex query interface that is more comprehensive than content-only searches as it considers three query dimensions (content, structure, metadata) in the search.

Our work is integrated in Wayfinder, an existing fully-functioning file system. We perform a thorough experimental evaluation of our techniques to show the effect of approximating individual dimensions on the overall scores and ranks of files, as well as on query performance. Our experiments show that our scoring strategy adequately takes into account the approximation in each dimension to efficiently evaluate fuzzy multi-dimensional queries. In addition, fuzzy query conditions in non-content dimensions can significantly improve scoring (and thus ranking) accuracy. 1...|$|R
