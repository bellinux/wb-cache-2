40|$|In this paper, the {{potential}} of recovering waste heat from the fryer section and exhaust stream sent to the stack of a typical potato crisps or chips manufacturing plant and using the heat to drive an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) system for power generation has been presented. Five different ORC system Options (A, B, C, D and E) were considered. The first two options (A and B) {{make use of the}} waste heat from the <b>foul</b> <b>gas</b> and exhaust to stack respectively for power generation using a single ORC system each while the third option (option C) makes use of a novel dual heat source single ORC system where the low temperature waste heat from the <b>foul</b> <b>gas</b> is used to provide preheating and the high temperature waste from the exhaust to the stack used to provide the evaporation. Option D also shows a dual heat source ORC system where the high temperature waste heat to the exhaust stack is used to provide the preheating while the lower temperature <b>foul</b> <b>gas</b> is used for the evaporation (reverse of option C in terms of waste heat usage) while option E makes use of a reheat cycle where the waste heat from the <b>foul</b> <b>gas</b> is used to provide the reheating of the working fluid exiting the turbine. In terms of waste heat usage, the combination of options A and B can be compared with options C, D and E. The simulation result shows that in terms of net power generation, cooling water requirement, and working fluid (R 245 fa) requirement, the combination of Options A and B gives the best power generation result and this is similar as the result produced by Option C. Following option C is option E which gave a better result than option D. The entropy generation analysis showed that the entropy generation is inversely proportional to the power output.

40|$|Methyl {{mercaptan}} (CH 3 SH) is {{a representative}} odorous pollutant from various odor emission {{sources such as}} sewage and municipal solid wastes. This study confirms that CH 3 SH in a synthetic <b>foul</b> <b>gas</b> can be effectively decomposed by UV-C (< 280 nm) photolysis using germicidal lamps, but is resistant to destruction under UV-A (365 nm) irradiation using black-light lamps. This study also demonstrates that CH 3 SH in <b>foul</b> <b>gas</b> can be successfully degraded by photocatalytic oxidation under UV-A irradiation using TiO 2 -based photocatalysts. In this study, two new catalysts, NH 4 +-modified TiO 2 (NH 4 +-TiO 2) and SO 4 2 [...] modified TiO 2 (SO 4 2 [...] TiO 2), were prepared by a precipitate-refluxing method and a hydrothermal method, respectively. These two catalysts {{as well as the}} commercially available catalyst Degussa P 25 (P 25 -TiO 2) were used for the photocatalytic degradation of CH 3 SH. It was found that the NH 4 +-TiO 2 catalyst achieved a better performance than P 25 -TiO 2, whereas SO 4 2 [...] TiO 2 demonstrated a poorer performance. The high photocatalytic activity of NH 4 +-TiO 2 for CH 3 SH degradation results from its basic characteristics and the presence of an ammonium (NH 4 +) group on the NH 4 +-TiO 2 catalyst surface. The photocatalytic degradation of CH 3 SH was further studied using the P 25 -TiO 2 catalyst under different experimental conditions. The experimental results showed that catalyst loading, relative humidity, and initial concentration could influence the efficiency of CH 3 SH photocatalytic degradation significantly. It was found that a catalyst loading of 3. 93 mg cm - 2 and a relative humidity of 43 % are two essential factors for achieving the best performance under these experimental conditions.

40|$|Odour {{control in}} Hong Kong has been {{addressed}} {{as an important}} issue by the authorities, since odour pollution is generated from many sources including wastewater treatment plants. Although a number of existing technologies are available for odour abatement and control, biological technique is still more attractive due to its low operating cost and ease of maintenance. A newly innovated fibrous bed bioreactor with twin columns was specially designed and constructed in our laboratory, in which an inner column was centred in an outer column. The bioreactor was fully filled with water in order to absorb the odorous components from <b>foul</b> <b>gas</b> and also contained both suspended and attached biomass to degrade the absorbed odorous pollutants. In this study, hydrogen sulphide (H?S) and butyric acid (C?H?O?) were used as odorous components and successfully removed from synthetic foul gases. Many factors affecting the H?S and butyric acid removal efficiency and maximum elimination capacity, such as pH of water solution, gas flow rate and its fluctuation, and sulphate content in solution have been studied. The experimental results demonstrated that the reduction rates of 97. 8 % for H 2 S and 99. 9 % for butyric acid were achieved in this experimental condition. It is proved that this bioreactor was a compact odorous gas treatment system with an application potential for treating foul air with high odour strength and low airflow rate such as the offensive gases from sludge treatment processes in a wastewater treatment plant.

40|$|When {{released}} into the atmosphere, traditional refrigerants contribute to climate change several orders of magnitude more than a corresponding amount of carbon dioxide. For that reason, an increasing amount of interest {{has been paid to}} transcritical vapor compression systems in recent years, which use carbon dioxide as a refrigerant. Vapor compression systems also impact the environment through their consumption of energy. This can be greatly increased by faulty operation. Automated techniques for detecting and diagnosing faults have been widely tested for subcritical systems, but have not been applied to transcritical systems. These methods can involve either dynamic analysis of the vapor compression cycle or a variety of algorithms based on steady state behavior. In this thesis, the viability of dynamic fault detection is tested in relation to that of static fault detection for a transcritical refrigeration system. Step tests are used to determine that transient behavior does not give additional useful information. The same tests are performed on a subcritical air-conditioner showing little value in dynamic fault detection. A static component based method of fault detection which has been applied to subcritical systems is also tested for all pairings of four faults: over/undercharge, evaporator <b>fouling,</b> <b>gas</b> cooler <b>fouling,</b> and compressor valve leakage. This technique allows for low cost measurement and independent detection of individual faults even when multiple faults are present. Results of this method are promising and allow distinction between faulty and fault-free behavior...|$|R

If she be wise she {{will take advantage of}} everything that will lighten the labor for her. There is no doubt but that a good sewage system saves an immense amount of time and labor. It carries away all the waste products from the house and relieves the home keeper of this drudgery. Such a system is economical in dollars and cents. When the overburdened worker in the house breaks down and doctor’s bills are due the “head of the house” realizes that he might have been saved this expense by easing the labors of his helpmate and there preventing the break down, by the inauguration of a good system of sewage disposal. It saves a great amount of wear and tear on clothing, especially shoes thus reducing the family shoe bill. It is economical again in making doctor’s bills unnecessary by preventing sickness. It is a sanitary arrangement in every respect. It carries away filth, that would cause disease, with speed, it prevents soil contamination and thereby drinking water. <b>Foul</b> <b>gases</b> are kept from entering the house as would come if the waste material was left to lie and decay about the yard.

40|$|In this study, methyl {{mercaptan}} (CH 3 SH) gas {{was used}} to prepare synthetic odorous gases, and a photocatalytic wet scrubbing process as a new approach was developed for treating such odorous gases. In this process, gaseous CH 3 SH is first absorbed by the solution, and the dissolved CH 3 SH/CH 3 S - is then adsorbed onto the solid surface of TiO 2 particles and oxidized under UV illumination in the aqueous phase. Experiments were conducted under different reaction conditions of CH 3 SH loading, TiO 2 dosage, and pH. The reaction kinetics of CH 3 SH reduction indicates that the pH of the reaction solution greatly influences the rate of CH 3 SH absorption by the solution. At pH 11. 5, the photoreaction becomes the RDS in such a system. The experiments demonstrated that the efficiency of CH 3 SH degradation determined by two methyl mercaptan sensors and the ratio of odor removal determined by olfactometry measurements can be well maintained at high levels of > 95 % for a CH 3 SH loading of 10 g m - 3 h - 1.
