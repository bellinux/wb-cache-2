The Crane Flat phase lasted from 1000BCE to 500CE and is marked by hunting with the atl atl {{and the use of}} grinding stones. The Tarmarack phase lasted from 500 until 1200, marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, indicating development and use of the bow and arrow. The Mariposa phase lasted from 1200 until contact with European Americans.|$|E

The four main divisions, from the top down, are the Upper Slaty, Upper Cherty, Lower Slaty and Lower Cherty. Below these are {{quartzite}} and granite, and Virginia Slate and Duluth gabbro lie above. The slate is from 50 to several hundred feet thick, and the four iron-bearing layers are from 400 to 600 feet thick.|$|E

5|$|Since a {{partially}} filled ballonet would cause longitudinal instability, {{due to the}} mass of air rolling fore or aft {{in the direction of}} pitch, two cloth partitions were used to <b>divide</b> <b>the</b> ballonet into three separate compartments; small holes in the partitions allowed the air to permeate gradually throughout the ballonet without affecting the stability of the airship.|$|E
5|$|Since w divides both {{terms on}} the {{right-hand}} side, it must also <b>divide</b> <b>the</b> left-hand side, v. This result is known as Euclid's lemma.
