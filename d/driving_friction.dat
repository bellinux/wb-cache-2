40|$|This paper summarises a {{numerical}} investigation of phase mixing in time-independent Hamiltonian systems that admit a coexistence of regular and chaotic phase space regions, allowing also for low amplitude perturbations idealised as periodic <b>driving,</b> <b>friction,</b> and/or white and colored noise. The evolution of initially localised ensembles of orbits was probed through lower order moments and coarse-grained distribution functions. In {{the absence of}} time-dependent perturbations, regular ensembles disperse initially as a power law in time and only exhibit a coarse-grained approach towards an invariant equilibrium over comparatively long times. Chaotic ensembles generally diverge exponentially fast on a time scale related to a typical finite time Lyapunov exponent, but can exhibit complex behaviour if they are impacted by the effects of cantori or the Arnold web. Viewed over somewhat longer times, chaotic ensembles typical converge exponentially towards an invariant or near-invariant equilibrium. This, however, need not correspond to a true equilibrium, which may only be approached over very long time scales. Time-dependent perturbations can dramatically increase the efficiency of phase mixing, both by accelerating the approach towards a near-equilibrium and by facilitating diffusion through cantori or along the Arnold web so as to accelerate the approach towards a true equilibrium. The efficacy of such perturbations typically scales logarithmically in amplitude, but is comparatively insensitive to most other details, a conclusion which reinforces the interpretation that the perturbations act via a resonant coupling.

50|$|A {{balance spring}} obeys Hooke's Law: the {{restoring}} torque {{is proportional to}} the angular displacement. When this property is exactly satisfied, the balance spring is said to be isochronous, and the period of oscillation is independent of the amplitude of oscillation. This is an essential property for accurate timekeeping, because no mechanical drive train can provide absolutely constant driving force. This is particularly true in watches and portable clocks which are powered by a mainspring, which provides a diminishing drive force as it unwinds. Another cause of varying <b>driving</b> force is <b>friction,</b> which varies as the lubricating oil ages.|$|R
40|$|The {{steady state}} {{propagation}} of a phase transition front is classified, according to hydrodynamics, as a deflagration or a detonation, depending on its velocity {{with respect to}} the fluid. These propagation modes are further divided into three types, namely, weak, Jouguet, and strong solutions, according to their disturbance of the fluid. However, some of these hydrodynamic modes will not be realized in a phase transition. One particular cause is the presence of instabilities. In this work we study the linear stability of weak detonations, which are generally believed to be stable. After discussing in detail the weak detonation solution, we consider small perturbations of the interface and the fluid configuration. When the balance between the <b>driving</b> and <b>friction</b> forces is taken into account, it turns out that there are actually two different kinds of weak detonations, which behave very differently as functions of the parameters. We show that the branch of stronger weak detonations are unstable, except very close to the Jouguet point, where our approach breaks down.

Only subtle differences in driver behaviour and perception could be noticed, but the dynamic rotation point is favourable. This is more prominent for low <b>friction</b> <b>driving.</b> The results of this work show that the momentary rotation point, i. e. the point in which the planar motion can be described by a single rotation, contains information that is valuable to the driver.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{dynamics}} of a driven, damped pendulum as used in mechanical clocks. We derive equations for the amplitude and phase of the oscillation, on time scales longer than the pendulum period. The equations are first order ODEs and permit fast simulations of the joint effects of circular and escapement errors, friction, and other disturbances for long times. The equations contain two averages of the driving torque over a period, so that the results are not very sensitive to the fine structure of the driving. We adopt a constant-torque escapement and study the stationary pendulum rate {{as a function of}} <b>driving</b> torque and <b>friction.</b> We also study the reaction of the pendulum to a sudden change in the driving torque, and to stationary noisy driving.

40|$|Snow and ice {{removal and}} {{clearing}} roadways after a winter storm account for {{major portion of}} roadway agencies located in snowy region’s maintenance budget. With the decreasing funds and increasing demand from the motoring public for mobility, roadway agencies are continuously looking for new innovative approaches for winter maintenance operations. One of {{the main focus of}} these approaches include performance measures for winter maintenance. This is specifically important when roadway agencies use contractors to perform winter maintenance tasks. In this study, two performance measures are studied extensively. These include, visual pavement condition behind the snow plow and pavement friction behind the snow plow. Visual pavement condition was observed and recorded into one of five categories while driving behind a snow plow. Pavement friction behind snow plow is measured using a Continuous Friction Measuring (CFT) device. Since visual pavement condition provides driver’s perception of the winter <b>driving</b> condition and <b>friction</b> measurements provide an objective measurement of the safety of the roadway under winter condition, a correlation of these provides a basic guideline for winter maintenance and performance measurement of winter maintenance.

40|$|In a {{conventional}} {{anti-lock brake system}} (ABS) the basic control algorithm {{is a combination of}} wheel acceleration/deceleration control and the wheel slip control. This control algorithm depends on the pre-configured threshold values that vary for each braking scenario which requires a large amount of field testing to achieve the best performance. In addition to that, the unpredictable nature of the driving conditions results in limitations not only in tracking the desired slip value within an acceptable range but also in the maximization of the friction force. In this work, a robust ABS algorithm based on Sliding Mode Control (SMC) technique is introduced. It is shown that regardless of uncertainties in the <b>driving</b> conditions the <b>friction</b> force is maximized and the stability of the vehicle is maintained resulting in a shorter brake distance and a better steer ability. For that purpose a self optimization method that calculates the desired slip value and a wheel slip controller to track this slip value are mainly proposed.

50|$|The main {{or driving}} disk {{is faced with}} a disk of aluminum. The driven disk has a working rim of elastic fiber. Lambert says in the invention, In {{practice}} I have found that this combination of aluminum and fiber bearing surfaces gives the maximum degree of friction and durability, thereby especially adapting the gearing for use on motor vehicles of the heavier kind, where the friction surfaces are at times subjected to great strains, and must, therefore, have a frictional contact of {{a high degree of}} efficiency in order to avoid slipping. It will be observed that the aluminum is advantageous also, because it will not tarnish or rust appreciably, but will always present a smooth, clean surface to the fiber periphery, so that wear will be reduced to a minimum. The friction disk drive was one of the key features of the Union automobile and Lambert automobile. Lambert started making the friction disk and traversing pinion drive in 1900. The first attempt was with a leather faced disk and an iron friction wheel. It had an eighteen inch diameter with a one and a half inch face. With this first attempt the leather was charred within the first three miles (5 km) of running it. The disk was then made with a wood fiber about a half inch thick. The material had a glossy surface and worked fine for a while, however it broke up after only 200 to 300 mi run. Lambert then conducted various experiments on the friction disk to get better performance. In one experiment a cone of cast aluminum was used as one member of a level friction drive with excellent results. Lambert then realizing that the pull was due to the aluminum itself, a disk was faced with it and the traversing wheel with strawboard. This accidental discovery made Lambert automobiles more successful than other cars that attempted at <b>friction</b> <b>driving.</b>|$|R
40|$|Burris, David L. Liquid {{lubricants}} are precluded in {{an exceedingly}} {{large number of}} consumer as well as extreme applications {{as a means to}} reduce friction and wear at the sliding interface of two bodies. The extraterrestrial environment is one such example of an extreme environment which has motivated the development of advanced solid lubricant materials. Mechanical systems for space require fabrication, assembly, transportation and testing on earth before launch and deployment. Solid lubricants for space are expected to not only operate efficiently in the hard vacuum of space but also withstand interactions with moisture or oxygen during the terrestrial storage, transportation and assembly prior to deployment and launch. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) is considered the gold standard in solid lubricants for space due to its excellent tribological properties in ultra-high vacuum. However in the presence of environmental species such as water and oxygen or at elevated temperatures, the lubricity and endurance of MoS 2 is severely limited. Past studies have offered several hypotheses for the breakdown of lubrication of MoS 2 under the influence of water and oxygen, although exact mechanisms remain unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear if temperature acts as a driver solely for oxidation or for thermally activated slip and thermally activated desorption as well. The answers to these questions are of fundamental importance to improving the reliability of existing MoS 2 -based solid lubricants for space, as well as for guiding the design of advanced lamellar solid lubricant coatings. This dissertation aims to elucidate: (1) the role of water on MoS 2 oxidation, (2) the role of water on MoS 2 friction, (3) the role of oxygen on MoS 2 friction, (4) the contribution of thermal activation to ambient-temperature friction, and (5) effects of length-scale. The results of this study showed that water does not cause oxidation of MoS 2. Water increases ambient-temperature friction of MoS 2 directly through a combination of both surface adsorption and diffusion into the coating subsurface. Thermally activated desiccation effectively dries the bulk of the coating, yielding low values of friction coefficient even at ambient humidity and temperature. Friction of MoS 2 decreases with increasing temperature between 25 ??C and 100 ??C in the presence of environmental water and increases in the presence of oxygen alone. At temperatures greater than 100 ??C, friction generally increases with temperature only in the presence of environmental oxygen; at these elevated temperatures, friction decreases with increasing humidity. The transition from room-temperature increase to elevated-temperature decrease in friction with increasing humidity is found to be a strong function of the contact history as well as coating microstructure. Lastly, the contribution of nanoscale tribofilms to macroscale friction was studied through nanotribometry. Friction measured on the worn MoS 2 coating with a nano-scale AFM probe showed direct and quantifiable evidence of sliding-induced surface modification of MoS 2; friction measured on the perfectly ordered single crystal MoS 2 was nearly an order of magnitude lower than friction on worn MoS 2. Although friction coefficients measured with a nanoscale probe showed high surface sensitivity, micron-sized AFM probes gave friction coefficients similar to those obtained in the macroscale, suggesting the formation of surface films in-situ during sliding with the colloidal probe. A reduction in friction is observed after annealing for both the nanoscale and microscale probes, suggesting a strong overriding effect of the desiccated bulk over surface adsorption in <b>driving</b> the <b>friction</b> response at these length-scales.

40|$|The {{grouting}} methodology in Sweden {{is developing}} towards {{a more extensive}} use of low water/cement-ratios. The main reason for this development is the better stability of the lower w/c-ratio grouts meaning that the water separation is less than for higher w/c-ratios. However, grouting in low permeable rock or in clay-filled fractures often is performed with high w/c-grouts with better sealing efficiency. Another method that involves high w/c-ratio grouting is “grout thickening” where the grouting starts with a high w/c-ratio and successively lower w/c-ratio is used. In this study the penetration and the stop mechanisms of suspension grouts have been investigated. The study started with a literature survey, from which hypothesis are formed and tested in the laboratory. The laboratory method used was sand column tests. The column, height 1 m and diameter 0. 1 m, was filled with 0. 9 m sand which was characterised by hydraulic measurements. The grouting was performed with Myanit, a suspension consisting of crushed dolomite with similar rheological characteristics as cement. The main advantage of using Mynait {{is that it is}} an inert material. This implies that it will keep it characteristics throughout the grouting and it will not harden with time. In order to obtain different relationships between grout grain size and theoretical aperture and hence groutability, different ratios between water and the solids were used as well as different sand grain distribution. Generally, the conclusions are that the penetration increased with higher water/solid-ratios and the penetration stops due to three different mechanisms. In apertures that are too small for the grout to enter, the sealing occurs due to blocking of the entrance. At the limit on what is possible to penetrate, a higher w/s-ratio leads to a further penetration compared to a grout with lower w/s-ratio. The suspension is not moving as a united front, rather it is a more dilute grout in the front, which leads to sealing by single suspensions grains that blocks the pathway. In larger aperture, the grout penetrates more united and the penetration stops due to equilibrium between <b>driving</b> forces and <b>friction</b> forces. The results implies that the use of “grout thickening” in the field will lead to that the initial higher w/c-ratio grout will penetrate a larger area of the fracture plane and suspension grains will successively plug the constrictions. The thicker grout will then penetrate the larger openings and the combined effect will give decreased permeability compared to only use one w/c-ratio...|$|R
40|$|Increasing energy {{consumption}} and depleting reserves {{of fossil fuels}} have resulted in growing interest in alternative renewable energy from the ocean. Ocean currents are an alternative source of clean energy due to their inherent reliability, persistence and sustainability. General ocean circulations exist {{in the form of}} large rotating ocean gyres, and feature extremely rapid current flow in the western boundaries due to the Coriolis Effect. The Gulf Stream system is formed by the western boundary current of the North Atlantic Ocean that flows along the east coastline of the United States, and therefore is of particular interest as a potential energy resource for the United States. This project created a national database of ocean current energy resources to help advance awareness and market penetration in ocean current energy resource assessment. The database, consisting of joint velocity magnitude and direction probability histograms, was created from data created by seven years of numerical model simulations. The accuracy of the database was evaluated by ORNL?s independent validation effort documented in a separate report. Estimates of the total theoretical power resource contained in the ocean currents were calculated utilizing two separate approaches. Firstly, the theoretical energy balance in the Gulf Stream system was examined using the two-dimensional ocean circulation equations based on the assumptions of the Stommel model for subtropical gyres with the quasi-geostrophic balance between pressure gradient, Coriolis force, wind stress and <b>friction</b> <b>driving</b> the circulation. Parameters including water depth, natural dissipation rate and wind stress are calibrated in the model so that the model can reproduce reasonable flow properties including volume flux and energy flux. To represent flow dissipation due to turbines additional turbine drag coefficient is formulated and included in the model. Secondly, to determine the reasonableness of the total power estimates from the Stommel model and to help determine the size and capacity of arrays necessary to extract the maximum theoretical power, further estimates of the available power based on the distribution of the kinetic power density in the undisturbed flow was completed. This used estimates of the device spacing and scaling to sum up the total power that the devices would produce. The analysis has shown that considering extraction over a region comprised of the Florida Current portion of the Gulf Stream system, the average power dissipated ranges between 4 - 6 GW with a mean around 5. 1 GW. This corresponds to an average of approximately 45 TWh/yr. However, if the extraction area comprises the entire portion of the Gulf Stream within 200 miles of the US coastline from Florida to North Carolina, the average power dissipated becomes 18. 6 GW or 163 TWh/yr. A web based GIS interface, [URL] was developed for dissemination of the data. The website includes GIS layers of monthly and yearly mean ocean current velocity and power density for ocean currents along the entire coastline of the United States, as well as joint and marginal probability histograms for current velocities at a horizontal resolution of 4 - 7 km with 10 - 25 bins over depth.
