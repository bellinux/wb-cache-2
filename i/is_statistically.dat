5|$|Despite his decisive penalty miss in the 1994 World Cup final shoot-out, Baggio <b>is</b> <b>statistically</b> {{one of the}} {{greatest}} penalty kick specialists in Italian football history. Baggio scored 85% of his career penalties with only 19 misses, scoring 108 out of 127 penalties in official matches, the most in Italian football history. He scored 10 with Vicenza, 25 with Fiorentina, 38 with Juventus, 5 with Milan, 11 with Bologna, 1 with Inter, 11 with Brescia and 7 with Italy (from 7 attempts, the most goals scored from the spot {{by a member of the}} national team.) 68 of his penalties were scored in Serie A, from 83 attempts, with an 82% conversion rate, one of the best records in Serie A history. In Serie A, Baggio scored 17 penalties for Fiorentina (from 19 attempts), 25 for Juventus (from 28 attempts), 3 for Milan (from 5 attempts), 11 for Bologna (from 11 attempts), 1 for Inter (from 2 attempts), and 11 for Brescia (from 18 attempts). Baggio has scored penalties for six different Serie A clubs. Four of his fifteen misses in Serie A were then scored on rebounds. Behind Totti, Baggio has scored the most penalties in Serie A history. Of his other penalties, 8 were scored in Serie C (from 8 attempts), 8 in European competitions (from 9 attempts), and 17 in the Coppa Italia (from 20 attempts). In shootouts, Baggio has converted three of four career penalties; in World Cup shootouts, Baggio scored twice (1990 and 1998), with his only miss in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{of their}} 38 matches {{have been on}} clay which <b>is</b> <b>statistically</b> Nadal's best surface and Federer's worst, with 13 being in finals. Nadal has a winning record on outdoor hard courts (8–6) and clay (13–2), while Federer leads on grass (2–1) and indoor hard courts (5–1). Because tournament {{seedings}} are based on rankings, 24 of their matches have been in tournament finals which have included an all-time record 9 Grand Slam tournament finals. From 2006 to 2008 they played in every French Open and Wimbledon final. Nadal won six of the nine, losing the first two Wimbledon finals. Four of these finals were five set-matches (2007 and 2008 Wimbledon, 2009 and 2017 Australian Open), with the 2008 Wimbledon final being lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts. Thirteen of their 38 meetings have reached a deciding set. They have also played in 12 Masters Series finals, including their lone five-hour match at the 2006 Rome Masters which Nadal won in a fifth-set tie-break having saved two match points and at the 2005 Miami Masters where Federer came back from 2 sets down to win in nearly 4 hours. They also contested {{the final of the}} ATP World Tour Finals in 2010 with Federer winning in 3 sets. Nadal has defeated Federer on grass in Wimbledon (which is Federer's better surface) but Federer {{has not been able to}} beat Nadal on clay in Roland Garros losing to him several times.|$|E
