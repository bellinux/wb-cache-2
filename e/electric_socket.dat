When Stacey finds out Martin is {{planning}} to propose, she says she does not want to marry again. He later proposes that she become his [...] "not-wife", so they are committed but not married, and she agrees. When Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) fails to corrently fix a faulty <b>electric</b> <b>socket,</b> Stacey is electrocuted. She and her baby are fine, and she finds out she is having a boy. She forgives Lee, and tells Shabnam that she saw her dead father Brian when she was electrocuted. When Shabnam finds the baby scan Stacey is hiding, Stacey throws her out of the flat and tears up the scan photo. When Shabnam asks why Stacey is hiding the photo from Martin, Stacey admits he is not the father but the real father was a one-night stand before getting together with him. When Kush confronts her, she tells him that she thinks he could be the father. Kush's mother Carmel Kazemi (Bonnie Langford) notices Kush and Stacey talking, and realises that he could be the father of Stacey's baby. Kush and Stacey convince Carmel not to tell Shabnam or Martin. When Stacey later attends a church service and prays for her father, she sees Kyle, who then leaves suddenly without telling her who he is, causing her to become more suspicious.|$|E

50|$|The memory battery (aka motherboard, CMOS, {{real-time}} clock (RTC), clock battery) is generally a CR2032 lithium coin cell. This cell battery has an estimated life of 3 years when {{power supply unit}} (PSU) is unplugged or when the PSU power switch is turned off. Other common battery cell types can last significantly longer or shorter periods, such as the smaller CR2016 which will generally last about 40% less time than CR2032. Higher temperatures and longer power-off time will shorten battery cell life. When replacing battery cell, the system time and CMOS BIOS settings may revert to default values. Unwanted BIOS reset may be avoided by replacing battery cell with PSU power switch turned on and plugged into <b>electric</b> <b>socket</b> on the wall. On ATX motherboards, turning on power switch on PSU, will supply 5V standby power to the motherboard to keep CMOS memory energized during computer turned off period.|$|E

Vicki has an access panel in her back, an <b>electric</b> <b>socket</b> {{in her right}} armpit, and an RS-232 serial port under her left armpit. Vicki's artificial intelligence is not perfect; she is incapable of emotion, speaks in a monotone voice and interprets most commands literally.

Occasionally Vicki had rare abilities that seemed to only appear in one or two episodes, such as elongating her neck to reach a door's peephole, shrinking her size to become as small as a doll or making herself ten feet tall to get noticed by everyone. Somehow, she could also channel enough electricity through her hands to jump-start a car (or with more control, restart a person's heart after suffering a coronary). One recurring theme was that Vicki had a super-powered learning system which enabled her to improve something such as a new detergent or to greatly increase the gas mileage of cars, which Jamie often saw as a chance to get rich quick, only to find her improvements were not perfect. Vicki lives in a cabinet in Jamie's bedroom, and becomes more human-like {{over the course of the}} show.|$|E

I {{actually}} wrote that while I was on tour and in New York, and I was loving the energy of being here and just feeling like I stuck my finger in an <b>electric</b> <b>socket.</b> I can't wait to do it live — I'm going to throw my hair around!" [...] —Madonna on the song [...] "I Love New York" [...] Confessions on a Dance Floor is a full-on dance, electronic and disco record, which is structured like a nightly set composed by a DJ. The music starts out light and happy, and as it progresses, it becomes intense, with the lyrics dealing more about personal feelings, hence [...] "Confessions". According to Madonna, [...] "this is the direction of my record. That's what we intended, to make a record that you can play at a party or in your car, where you don't have to skip past a ballad. It's nonstop." [...] Madonna used samples and references of music by other disco artists. In the album's first song, [...] "Hung Up", she sampled ABBA's 1979 hit [...] "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)", for which she wrote a personal letter to songwriters Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, who gave Madonna {{permission to use the}} track. References of other disco-influenced acts, including Pet Shop Boys, Depeche Mode, and Daft Punk, were also used on the album, as were the disco hits of Parisian DJ Cerrone. The album has a song called [...] "Forbidden Love", which is different from the same titled song from Madonna's sixth studio album Bedtime Stories. Regarding sampling herself and her own song names, Madonna commented:"I did all of that on purpose, ... I mean, if I'm going to plagiarize somebody, {{it might as well be}} me, right? I feel like I've earned the right to rip myself off. 'Talent borrows, genius steals,' ... "Let's see how many other clichés I can throw in there. That's exactly it. I was only hinting early on, but then I tell it like it is. It's like, now that I have your attention, I have a few things to tell you."A pulsating rhythm is present in the song [...] "Isaac", which is regarded as the only song close to a ballad on the album. However, the song was criticised heavily by a group of Israeli rabbis who commented that Madonna was committing a blasphemy with their religion. They said that the song was about sixteenth century Kabbalah scholar Yitzhak Luria. In reality, the song was named after the featured vocalist Yitzhak Sinwani, who sang portions of the Yemenite Hebrew poem Im Nin'alu in the track. Initially Madonna toyed with the idea of calling the song as [...] "Fear of Flying" [...] since the idea behind the composition was to let go. However, at the end she decided to just call it [...] "Isaac" [...] after the English version of Sinwani's name. Regarding the song's development and the condemnation of the Rabbis, Madonna said:"You do appreciate the absurdity of a group of rabbis in Israel claiming that I'm being blasphemous about someone when they haven't heard the record, right? And then, everyone in the media runs with it as if it's the truth. And that's a little weird. But what's even weirder is that the song is not about Isaac Lurier, as the rabbis claim. It's named after Yitzhak Sinwani, who's singing in Yemenite on the track. I couldn't think of a title for the song. So I called it [...] "Isaac" [...] English translation of [...] "Yitzhak". It's interesting how their minds work, those naughty rabbis. ... He's saying, [...] "If all of the doors of all of the generous peoples' homes are closed to you, the gates of heaven will always be open." [...] The words are about 1,000 years old. ... Yitzhak is an old friend of mine. He's never made a record. He comes from generations of beautiful singers. Stuart and I asked him to come into the studio one day. We said, [...] "We're just going to record you. We don't know what we're going to do with it." [...] He's flawless. One take, no bad notes. He doesn't even need a microphone. We took one of the songs he did and I said to Stuart, [...] "Let's sample these bits. We'll create a chorus and then I'll write lyrics around it." [...] That's how we constructed it." ...|$|E
