30|$|Following {{the initial}} {{discovery}} {{of the effect of}} auxin-BR crosstalk on lamina <b>joint</b> <b>bending,</b> several genes have now been reported to be involved (Luo et al. 2016). For instance, LPA 1 negatively regulates lamina <b>joint</b> <b>bending</b> by inhibiting BR signaling and increasing the expression of auxin transporters (Liu et al. 2016). In a recent study, the SMOS 1 -SMOS 2 /DLT complex positively regulated expression of OsPHI- 1, and treatment of smos mutants with auxin and BR still showed a synergistic effect on lamina <b>joint</b> <b>bending</b> (Hirano et al. 2017). In the current study, we showed that DS 1 -OsARF 11 is invoved in auxin-BR crosstalk in rice.

In this paper, a classic rice mutant gsor 300084, showing erect leaves and semi-dwarf stature, was characterized. Morphological analysis in darkness showed that the mesocotyl of the gsor 300084 mutant did not elongate when grown in darkness. Coleoptile elongation and root growth were less affected by the exogenous application of brassinolide (BL), the most active form of BR, in gsor 300084 than in the wild-type rice variety Matsumae. Lamina <b>joint</b> <b>bending</b> analysis also showed that gsor 300084 was less sensitive to exogenous BL than Matsumae. These results suggested that the gsor 300084 mutant is defective in BR sensitivity. Map-based cloning indicated that gsor 300084 is a novel allelic mutant of the DWARF 61 (D 61) gene, which encodes the putative BR receptor OsBRI 1. A single-base mutation appears in the LRR domain of OsBRI 1, changing the 444 th amino acid from tryptophan (W) to arginine (R).

40|$|In rice (Oryza sativa), {{brassinosteroids}} (BRs) induce cell {{elongation at}} the adaxial {{side of the}} lamina joint to promote leaf bending. We identified a rice mutant (ili 1 -D) showing an increased lamina inclination phenotype similar to that caused by BR treatment. The ili 1 -D mutant overexpresses an HLH protein homologous to Arabidopsis thaliana Paclobutrazol Resistance 1 (PRE 1) and the human Inhibitor of DNA binding proteins. Overexpression and RNA interference suppression of ILI 1 increase and reduce, respectively, rice laminar inclination, confirming a positive role of ILI 1 in leaf bending. ILI 1 and PRE 1 interact with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein IBH 1 (ILI 1 binding bHLH), whose overexpression causes erect leaf in rice and dwarfism in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of ILI 1 or PRE 1 increases cell elongation and suppresses dwarf phenotypes caused by overexpression of IBH 1 in Arabidopsis. Thus, ILI 1 and PRE 1 may inactivate inhibitory bHLH transcription factors through heterodimerization. BR increases the RNA levels of ILI 1 and PRE 1 but represses IBH 1 through the transcription factor BZR 1.

40|$|We have {{characterized}} a rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant, dwarf 11 (d 11), {{that bears}} seeds of reduced length. To understand the {{mechanism by which}} seed length is regulated, the D 11 gene was isolated by a map-based cloning method. The gene was found to encode a novel cytochrome P 450 (CYP 724 B 1), which showed homology to enzymes involved in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis. The dwarf phenotype of d 11 mutants was restored by {{the application of the}} brassinolide (BL). Compared with wild-type plants, the aberrant D 11 mRNA accumulated at higher levels in d 11 mutants and was dramatically reduced by treatment with BL, implying that the gene is feedback-regulated by BL. Precise determination of the defective step(s) in BR synthesis in d 11 mutants proved intractable because of tissue specificity and the complex control of BR accumulation in plants. However, 6 -deoxotyphasterol (6 -DeoxoTY) and typhasterol (TY), but not any upstream intermediates before these compounds, effectively restored BR response in d 11 mutants in a lamina <b>joint</b> <b>bending</b> assay.

Thus, genetic manipulation of endogenous BR levels might offer {{a way of}} improving the agronomic traits of crops, including plant architecture and stress tolerance. In this study, we produced transgenic creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) overexpressing a BR-inactivating enzyme, Arabidopsis thaliana BR-related acyltransferase 1 (AtBAT 1), which is known to catalyze the conversion of BR intermediates to inactive acylated conjugates. After putative transgenic plants were selected using herbicide resistance assay, genomic integration of the AtBAT 1 gene was confirmed by genomic PCR and Southern blot analysis, and transgene expression was validated by northern blot analysis. The transgenic creeping bentgrass plants exhibited BR-deficient phenotypes, including reduced plant height with shortened internodes (i. e., semi-dwarf), reduced leaf growth rates with short, wide, and thick architecture, high chlorophyll contents, decreased numbers of vascular bundles, and large lamina <b>joint</b> <b>bending</b> angles (i. e., erect leaves).

40|$|The {{deformation}} of adhesively bonded composite butt joints in tension was investigated experimentally, theoretically, and numerically. Two single-strap butt joints were tested, {{the only difference}} between them being the thickness of the doubler. The case 1 joint was fabricated using identical laminated composite panels for both the adherends and the doubler, while the case 2 joint had a 50 % thicker doubler. Expressions for the effective Young's modulus and bending stiffness for the composite butt joint were derived under both plane strain and plane stress conditions. Joint deformation in the out-of-plane direction and longitudinal elongation could then be theoretically analyzed. A theoretical model for the joint elongation was developed, and an approach was proposed to deal with the strain discontinuity at the overlap end of the joint using the derived theoretical method. Three-dimensional finite element models were created for the analysis of the unit-width joints under a plane strain condition. Good agreement in the predicted joint deformation (deflection, elongation, and strain) was achieved between the three methods. The results suggested that <b>joint</b> <b>bending</b> under both plane strain and plane stress condition should be studied so that the actual strain range in high bend areas (overlap edge regions) can be determined.

Finite element results showed that peak adhesive stresses were located at the inner overlap edge, and suggested that appropriate reinforcement should be made in this region to ensure a sufficient safety margin.

This study will focuses on two objectives which are to observe the effects towards the knee joint which having various cases of meniscus and also to observe the functionality of the meniscus which is wedges in shape. The method used in this study is a simulation of knee joint which is consisting of three main parts, femur, tibia and meniscus. In order to observe what the effects towards the knee joint, various cases is being simulated which are knee joint with healthy meniscus compared with knee joint with various of torn meniscus and a simulation of full leg with and without knee pad with existence of external impact. The boundary condition of force parameter is calculated from the ball velocity after being kicked where the comparison between the two types of kicking result with instep kicking got high impact force and distributed force than inside kicking. The highest distributed force then is used for the simulation. Simulation result shows that a healthy meniscus transmits load across the joint in a uniform state within the range of 0. 3 MPa and 0. 4 MPa. For torn meniscus, the result shows that it is failed to transmit the load across the joint. Thus an excessive stress is recorded {{across the surface of the}} tibia.

40|$|The {{designer}} of lattice trusses has been traditionally encouraged to avoid extra <b>joint</b> <b>bending</b> moments by ensuring 'noding' of member centre lines. This can however cause {{problems in the}} design of RHS trusses with small (economical) branch members by causing large gaps at joints with undesirable flexibility for slender chord walls. 100 % overlap joints overcome this problem while still maintaining economic single cut branch ends. The research programme set out first to highlight the difference in behaviour of trusses with large gap noding and completely overlapping joints. Two similar trusses - one gap, the other lap - with matched sections were tested to failure. It was concluded that the gap joint truss (branch/chord width ratio = 0. 4) was much less efficient than the corresponding 100 % overlap truss despite the large eccentricities. The collapse load of the latter was some 35 % greater, while the stiffness properties were better, and remained linear for a substantial proportion of the loading. On the other hand the gap joint truss soon became non-linear, with large overall deflections. Local connecting chord wall deflections were quite small in the lap joints while appreciable deflections occurred at gap joints under service loads. Elastic frame analyses were carried out for all the six test trusses (one gap and five lap). For the overlap trusses, axial forces and bending moments could be predicted fairly accurately but a non-linear analysis was required for the gap jointed truss even at fairly modest loads. The effects of ß ratio, chord slenderness and branch angle were all examined within the parameter range tested. The advantages of truss continuity moments as well as plastic redistribution of moments have been observed to reduce the occurrence of the local chord buckling mode of failure (L 7), compared with previous isolated joint tests. Results obtained from tests on isolated joints can give good agreement with those obtained from truss tests, both with respect to strength and failure mode. However, as the isolated joint testing cannot always reproduce the support conditions in a truss, the failure modes (and hence strengths) can differ. The current CIDECT design strength equations and recommendations for gap and overlap joints are largely {{based on the results of}} isolated joint testing. The suitability of the CIDECT strength equations and recommendations for designing RHS lattice trusses has been reviewed.
