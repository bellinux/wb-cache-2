25|$|In Puerto Rico, they {{underwent}} creolization, {{lost their}} almond and gained ground cassava. They can take varying amounts {{of sugar and}} spices. It's possible that Puerto Rico's most common version of this dessert (South American version with dulce de leche) reached Puerto Rico from Venezuela, but the opposite is also possible. Depending on region some add cornstarch, citrus zest, ginger and honey, filled with chocolate, vanilla cream, dulce de leche, fruit paste, or coconut. The <b>filling</b> <b>can</b> be mixed with almonds, sesame seeds, coconut flakes, or sprinkles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the process}} of {{integrated}} circuit design and manufacturing, dummy metal <b>fill</b> <b>can</b> improve the planarity of layout after Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP). However, it will also cause lithography distortion and Critical Area (CA) variation. This paper compares and analyzes the influences of lithography distortion due to metal fill on CA {{from the perspectives of}} different defect particles based on 45 nm technology node. The results indicate that dummy metal <b>fill</b> <b>can</b> increase open CA after lithography and the defect particle with the diameter of 0. 066 um leads to the largest increment percentage of open CA, which will take up almost 10 %. This paper is instructive in researching dummy metal fill and CA or related fields in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{test data}} and an {{analysis}} were presented, of heat transfer {{characteristics of a}} solar thermal energy storage bed utilizing water <b>filled</b> <b>cans</b> as the energy storage medium. An {{attempt was made to}} optimize can size, can arrangement, and bed flow rates by experimental and analytical means. Liquid <b>filled</b> <b>cans,</b> as storage media, utilize benefits of both solids like rocks, and liquids like water. It was found that this combination of solid and liquid media shows unique heat transfer and heat content characteristics and is well suited for use with solar air systems for space and hot water heating. An extensive parametric study was made of heat transfer characteristics of rocks, of other solids, and of solid containers filled with liquids...|$|R

50|$|Fill dirt {{should be}} as free of organic matter as {{possible}} since organic matter will decompose creating pockets of empty space within the fill which could result in settling. Uneven or excessive settling of the <b>fill</b> <b>can</b> result in damage to any structures built on the fill.|$|R

50|$|White cake is {{currently}} the most traditional wedding cake flavor, but different flavors of <b>filling</b> <b>can</b> be added between layers. Chocolate, carrot, Italian Rum and Italian Cream are also popular choices. Frosting can be a classic smooth surface or combined with drizzle, swirls, or chips.|$|E
50|$|In Transylvania, {{the name}} piroști {{is used in}} Romanian {{families}} of German or Slavic origin and the <b>filling</b> <b>can</b> also be a whole, fresh, seedless plum. The term colțunaș is used by native Romanian families and are usually filled with cottage cheese or quark and served topped with sour cream smântână, traditionally called colțunași cu smântână.|$|E
50|$|The <b>filling</b> <b>can</b> be {{minced meat}} (pork, lamb, beef, {{or any other}} kind of meat), or fish. The mixing {{together}} of different kinds of meat is also popular. The traditional Udmurt recipe requires a mixture of 45% beef, 35% mutton, and 20% pork. Various spices, such as black pepper and diced onions as well as garlic, are mixed into the filling.|$|E

50|$|Non-glutinous {{rice flour}} is steamed in siru (steamer) and pounded in jeolgu (mortar) {{to form a}} dough. It is then cut into small pieces, rolled out flat and round, and filled with geopipat-so (white adzuki bean paste) and sealed. The <b>filling</b> <b>can</b> be made by husking adzuki beans (often the black variety), {{steaming}} and seasoning it with salt, and sieving it. Sesame oil is brushed on each tteok {{to prevent it from}} sticking.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{ingredients}} of the pastry are flour - most commonly wheat or buckwheat - mixed with egg, oil, {{warm water and}} salt. These are then mixed together and the dough rolled out into a thin layer. The <b>filling</b> <b>can</b> be either sweet or savoury; the most common fillings are apple, walnut, poppy seed, cottage cheese or tarragon. The chosen filling is then spread onto the sheet of dough, and the dough then formed into a roll.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new method, called the projection filling, to fill any regions based on contour structure points. Four types {{of the structure}} points are detected based on the structure pattern models of chain codes of contours. The projection filling proceeds between each pair of the neighbouring structural points (filling section) parallelly. The new <b>filling</b> algorithm <b>can</b> <b>fill</b> any regions including some contours which <b>can</b> not be <b>filled</b> by traditional filling algorithms, such as the "seed" and the "even-odd" algorithms. The projection <b>filling</b> method <b>can</b> be used in image analysis, recognition and computer graphics...|$|R

50|$|Albéric Barbier has apricot-yellow buds {{that open}} to medium-sized, cream {{coloured}} flowers {{with a light}} yellow center, and quickly fade to white {{with a hint of}} lemony yellow. They have an average diameter of 8 cm (3"), 9 to 16 petals, and a strong fruity fragrance. The flowers appear mostly solitary or in small clusters in an opulent single flush in June. The bloom form is globular and quartered, the <b>filling</b> <b>can</b> vary from semi-double to more densely filled, resembling tea roses.|$|E
50|$|Liquid filling is {{sometimes}} {{used as an}} alternative to potting or impregnation. It's usually a dielectric fluid, chosen for chemical compatibility with the other materials present. This method is used mostly in very large electrical equipment such as utility transformers, to increase breakdown voltage. It {{can also be used to}} improve heat transfer, especially if allowed to circulate by natural convection or forced convection through a heat exchanger. Liquid <b>filling</b> <b>can</b> be removed for repair much more easily than potting.|$|E

50|$|The lifting {{process can}} utilize many {{different}} techniques, depending upon situational variables. The filling process uses compressed air to blow dry sand into any existing voids. The sand travels through hoses and nozzles to the void and deposits continuously. The sand travels wherever the air goes. It gradually loses momentum and deposits, nestling in with other {{grains of sand}} at 99-100% density (Midwest Testing). The <b>filling</b> <b>can</b> be performed {{from the surface of}} the slab or from the side of the slab if available.|$|E
