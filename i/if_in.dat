40|$|Several {{issues related}} to the {{interface}} structure in molecular-beam epitaxially grown InAs/AlSb and InAs/GaSb heterostructures are investigated by Raman scattering, photoluminescence and X-ray measurements. The measurements reveal differing degrees of layer intermixing at the interfaces (IFs), greatest for AlAs-like <b>IFs</b> <b>in</b> the InAs/AlSb material system, less pronounced for GaAs-like <b>IFs</b> <b>in</b> the InAs/GaSb material system, and smallest for InSb like <b>IFs</b> <b>in</b> both systems. This intermixing is both thermodynamically favoured and, in addition, driven by a lowering of the strain-induced component of the surface energy...|$|R

5|$|Double-strand DNA {{breaks in}} {{bacteria}} are repaired by the RecBCD pathway of homologous recombination. Breaks that occur {{on only one}} of the two DNA strands, known as single-strand gaps, are thought to be repaired by the RecF pathway. Both the RecBCD and RecF pathways include a series of reactions known as branch migration, in which single DNA strands are exchanged between two intercrossed molecules of duplex DNA, and resolution, in which those two intercrossed molecules of DNA are cut apart and restored to their normal double-stranded state. Homologous recombination occurs in several groups of viruses. In DNA viruses such as herpesvirus, recombination occurs through a break-and-rejoin mechanism like in bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, branch migration is facilitated by the RuvABC complex or RecG protein, molecular motors that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move the junction. The junction must then be resolved into two separate duplexes, restoring either the parental configuration or a crossed-over configuration. Resolution can occur in either a horizontal or vertical fashion during homologous recombination, giving patch products (<b>if</b> <b>in</b> same orientation during double strand break repair) or splice products (<b>if</b> <b>in</b> different orientations during double strand break repair). RuvA and RuvB are branch migration proteins, while RuvC is a junction-resolving enzyme.|$|E

5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} arrest by {{an officer}} without warrant {{and who had}} no right to arrest him, and <b>if</b> <b>in</b> the course of that resistance the officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest would be reduced from what would have been murder if the officer had had the right to arrest, to manslaughter.

So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of an inning during which runs are scored after an error or passed ball, the official scorer attempts to recreate {{the events of the}} inning without the errors or passed balls. <b>If</b> <b>in</b> the official scorer's opinion a run would not have scored without the defensive lapses, then the run is unearned. If the scorer believes that a run would have scored anyway, the run is earned and charged to the pitcher. In one basic example, if the first batter reaches by an error, the second batter hits a home run, and the next three batters strike out, then one of the two runs which were scored are unearned. There are rules and restrictions which govern this general guideline.|$|E

Comparisons of dietary intake of <b>IFs</b> <b>in</b> Asian and Western populations, in special subgroups like vegetarians, vegans, and infants are made and our knowledge on their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion by the human body is presented. The influences of the gut microflora, age, gender, background diet, food matrix, and the chemical nature of the IFs on the metabolism of IFs are described. Potential mechanisms by which IFs may exert their actions are reviewed, and genetic polymorphism as determinants of biological response to soy IFs is discussed. The effects of IFs on a range of health outcomes including atherosclerosis, breast, intestinal, and prostate cancers, menopausal symptoms, bone health, and cognition are reviewed {{on the basis of the}} available in vitro, in vivo animal and human data...|$|R
