5|$|Climatic shifts {{may affect}} tornadoes via teleconnections in {{shifting}} the jet stream {{and the larger}} weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> suspect that global warming may affect trends in tornado activity, any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region.|$|E
5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> conclude that the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E
5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess. The arguments {{in favor of}} antibiotic treatment should be balanced by the consideration of possible side effects, and it <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications. Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate than would be expected from how common it is.|$|E

25|$|Hypercalcemia (usually {{defined as}} a calcium level above the {{reference}} range) is mostly caused by either primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy, and therefore, it <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> include these in the differential diagnosis.|$|E

50|$|The {{court held}} that the EPA was correct in {{enforcing}} these regulations upon Chemical Waste Management. It <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> expect the firm to report leakage of a substance, although it was not considered hazardous. It also held that it <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> expect Chemical Waste Management to especially report leakages that had breached the two check system and thus were in violation of the old requirements, regardless of it being in a transitional stage.|$|R
25|$|National pride, rivalries between nations, and the {{politics}} of public relations have in the past been the primary motivations for shaping space projects. It <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> assume that these factors would also be present in planetary terraforming efforts.|$|E
25|$|The engines used {{welded steel}} tube engine mount of 4130 Chrome-Molybdenum tubing and flat stock. It <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> assume that load bearing {{members of the}} mount system {{extended}} far enough to transfer the torsion and tension loads into the main wing 3structure.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{simplest}} methods is linear interpolation (sometimes known as lerp). Consider the above example of estimating f(2.5). Since 2.5 is midway between 2 and 3, it <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> take f(2.5) midway between f(2) = 0.9093 and f(3) = 0.1411, which yields 0.5252.|$|E
25|$|The {{lifespan}} of Corydoras panda in {{the aquarium}} {{has not been}} systematically determined, but given the longevity of other Corydoras species in the aquarium, it <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> assume that well-cared for specimens will enjoy a lifespan in excess of ten years, and frequently in excess of 15 years.|$|E
25|$|In early 2006, The Nature Conservancy further {{noted that}} the BioBlitz of 2002 was not the {{definitive}} work on the species within Owasippe.

25|$|Nevertheless, given Barrientos' close {{relationship}} with the Princes of Aragón, it <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> conclude that, at least at first, he was a supporter of the opposition camp. Nevertheless, he was a skillful politician who knew how to maneuver when political winds shifted in favor of John II, to save himself from misfortune.|$|E
25|$|Virtually {{all of the}} {{writings}} of Hipparchus are lost, including his work on precession. They are mentioned by Ptolemy, who explains precession as {{the rotation of the}} celestial sphere around a motionless Earth. It <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> presume that Hipparchus, similarly to Ptolemy, thought of precession in geocentric terms as a motion of the heavens, rather than of the Earth.|$|E

25|$|Mutations in the Ras {{family of}} proto-oncogenes (comprising H-Ras, N-Ras and K-Ras) are very common, being found in 20% to 30% {{of all human}} tumors. it <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> {{speculate}} that a pharmacological approach that curtails Ras activity may represent a possible method to inhibit certain cancer types. Ras point mutations are the single most common abnormality of human proto-oncogenes.|$|E
25|$|Brine is {{a problem}} in {{proportion}} to the humidity created, since water's vapor pressure decreases with salinity, it <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> expect at least as much brine as water in humidity. This means that a river of brine flows way from the powerplant at 41 tons (m3s-1) per second, along with a river of saline water flowing in with 82 tons of water per second (m3s-1).|$|E
25|$|Non-operating Adjustments.

For this reason, non-operating assets (such as excess cash) are usually eliminated from the balance sheet.|$|E

There must <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> ground <b>to</b> believe that the danger apprehended is imminent.
