Some modern historians doubt that the Bulgarian defeat was as complete as described by Skylitzes and Kekaumenos. Other historians emphasize that the death of Emperor Samuel two months later was much more fateful for Bulgaria. His heirs Gabriel Radomir and Ivan Vladislav were unable to effectively resist the attacks of Basil II, and Bulgaria was completely defeated in 1018. In that year Emperor Ivan Vladislav {{was killed in a}} battle at Dyrrhachium, and Bulgaria became a province of the Byzantine Empire until the successful uprising led by the Asen brothers in 1185.|$|E

2500|$|Tucker {{wanted to}} {{increase}} the requirements for a LL.B., and so he created a [...] "Plan for Conferring Degrees on the Students of Law in the University of William and Mary". Under Tucker's plan, students {{would be required to}} attend two full years' worth of courses, or the majority of three years' worth. Students would be expected to know ancient and modern history, politics, and constitutions (with special emphasis on the Virginia state and United States federal constitutions); and they would also have to [...] "be well-versed in" [...] ethics, municipal laws, and British laws still in effect in Virginia, as well as rules of practice in the Commonwealth. A professor would conduct a closed-book oral exam of the student on a topic of the professor's choosing; if a student passed the professor's exam, the student would apply to practice law before either the County Courts or Court of Appeal of Virginia. If admitted to practice, the student would write a thesis. Once the thesis was approved by the professors and printed, the College would award the student a Bachelor of Law. Tucker's plan provided for LL.B. recipients to receive a Master of Arts degree with two more years of residence at the College, or by taking an exam after four years if they were away. Students who received the LL.B. could also earn a Doctor of Laws degree by taking an exam after <b>four</b> <b>more</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> residing and studying at the College, after eight years away from the College, or after five years of practicing before a superior court.
