The data analyzed were used to identify the major relationship between variables (determinants of chicken production), opportunities of poultry production and value of poultry sales. The major or main determinants involved in assessment were identified in the amount of chicken sold in one production year were channeled through the number of years in chicken keeping (experience), the total cost used in chicken production and the total interest borrowed with farmer in month and direct income received after selling of the commodity from farmers to consumers and deduct total cost encountered during operation. Results obtained from the model indicated that sex of entrepreneur, family size, education level of entrepreneur, number of training attended with farmers were the variables that influence the live chicken production negatively. The results obtained further showed that majority of the poultry farmers were in the age range of between 35 and 55 years had positively respond to chicken keeping and revealed youth poultry farmers were not fully economically efficient in the use of chicken production. The study concluded by making suggestions which could improve the broilers production among the farmers in the study area and in Tanzania as a whole.

5000|$|Racial {{segregation}} {{is generally}} outlawed, but may exist de facto through social norms, {{even when there}} is no strong individual preference for it, as suggested by Thomas Schelling's models of segregation and subsequent work. [...] Segregation may be maintained by means ranging from discrimination in <b>hiring</b> <b>and</b> in the <b>rental</b> <b>and</b> sale of housing to certain races to vigilante violence (such as lynchings). Generally, a situation that arises when members of different races mutually prefer to associate and do business with members of their own race would usually be described as separation or de facto separation of the races rather than segregation. In the United States, segregation was mandated by law in some states and came with anti-miscegenation laws (prohibitions against interracial marriage). Segregation, however, often allowed close contact in hierarchical situations, such as allowing a person of one race to work as a servant for a member of another race. Segregation can involve [...] separation of the races, and mandatory use of different institutions, such as schools and hospitals by people of different races.|$|R

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission today {{published a}} final determination made in the arbitration of a dispute over access to the Line Sharing Service. The final determination specifies certain of the terms on which Telstra supplies the LSS to Chime Communications. These are LSS <b>rental</b> <b>charges,</b> <b>and</b> the terms on which wholesale ADSL services are migrated to the LSS. This follows the parties being unable to agree on them, and Chime notifying the dispute for ACCC arbitration. The ACCC has specified a LSS <b>rental</b> <b>charge</b> of 2. 50 per service per month, and has reduced the charges and timeframes to migrate in bulk wholesale ADSL services to the LSS. The specified charges are {{to apply for the}} period from 1 June 2004 until 31 December 2007. The charges result from applying the ACCC 2 ̆ 7 s long-standing pricing principles for the LSS (August 2002) and, in respect of LSS <b>rental</b> <b>charges,</b> the ruling of the Australian Competition Tribunal (June 2006). Telstra proposed in previous regulatory proceedings an LSS <b>rental</b> <b>charge</b> of 9 per service per month, which was opposed by access seekers, and considered not to be reasonable by both the ACCC (December 2005) and the Australian Competition Tribunal (June 2006). Despite these rulings, Telstra continued to require access seekers to pay a 9 per month charge. A key issue in this arbitration was whether a contribution to the costs of the line over which the LSS is supplied {{should be included in the}} LSS <b>rental</b> <b>charges</b> to apply until 31 December 2007. The ACCC decided against doing so. The ACCC has for some time recognised that economic efficiency could be enhanced by the inclusion of an appropriate contribution to line costs in LSS <b>rental</b> <b>charges.</b> However, where line <b>rental</b> <b>charges</b> fully recover line costs, the inclusion of such a contribution in LSS <b>rental</b> <b>charges</b> would lead to an over-recovery of network cost.

By evaluating the performance of The Link REIT, its shopping centres and the customer satisfaction, implication of The Link's management to the REIT, the shopping centres and even the society were identified. In this research, the evaluation for performance of The Link REIT would be divided into three scopes. Firstly, the performance of REIT would be evaluated by analyzing the indices. Secondly, the attributes of The Link's shopping centres would be evaluated by analyzing the determinants of rental income. Last but not least, customer satisfaction would be evaluated by measuring the service quality based on SERVQUAL instrument. The first two scopes of evaluation would be mainly based on the secondary data. Primary data obtained by questionnaire survey would be collected for the evaluation of customer satisfaction. After collecting and analyzing all data, position impacts of The Link's management was identified to the performance of REIT and the attributes of its shopping centres. In contrary on the first two evaluations, customers including both of the visitors and tenants were found dissatisfied to the empathy attributes of The Link's shopping centres. The customer expectation valued greater than the customer perception. In other words, The Link failed to understanding or providing what customers need. Upon conducting the regressive analysis of the secondary data, contradiction between the development of The Link and public expectation was finally concluded.

5000|$|In 1920 he was {{counsel for}} the Lockwood Committee, {{appointed}} by the state Legislature to investigate an alleged conspiracy among the building trades of New York City. It was charged that labor leaders were using their power by extorting bribes {{for the prevention of}} strikes, by preventing independent bids and by forcing building awards to favorites. Many illegal acts were disclosed and numerous convictions secured. Robert P. Brindell, who was {{at the head of the}} labor council of the building trades with a membership of 115,000 was prosecuted by Untermyer, who conducted the case in person as a special attorney-general, and convicted of extortion and sentenced to five-to-ten years in state prison. At the end of 1921, when the prosecutions were being continued, more than 600 indictments had been found as a result of the investigation and many more were said to be pending. There were more than 200 convictions including pleas of guilty by employers, labor leaders and others and over $500,000 had been collected in fines. In connection with the exposure of abuses and acts of illegality among the labour unions, all unions in the state were required, under the threat of criminal prosecution and of submitting to incorporation, to amend their constitutions and bylaws by eliminating these abuses; this they all agreed to do. It was shown that in many of the building trades both manufacturers and dealers, often with the collusive aid of labour leaders, had organized to fix prices and prevent competition. Subsequent prosecutions established the fact that these and other unfair practices were an important element in preventing building operations <b>and</b> increasing <b>rental</b> <b>charges</b> for dwelling property. Public opinion, especially in view of the housing shortage, reacted sharply to these revelations, and it was felt that Untermyer's work in this connection had been performed with admirable public spirit, energy and courage. It was generally believed, moreover, that the evils brought to light by the committee were not confined to New York, and a demand for similar investigations arose in other parts of the country.|$|R

50|$|Critics {{point out}} the {{possibility}} of cheating the system by odometer tampering. Although the newer electronic odometers are difficult to roll back, they can still be defeated by disconnecting the odometer wires and reconnecting them later. However, as the Cents Per Mile Now website points out:As a practical matter, resetting odometers requires equipment plus expertise that makes stealing insurance risky and uneconomical. For example, to steal 20000 mi of continuous protection while paying for only the 2000 in the 35000 to 37000 range on the odometer, the resetting would have to be done at least nine times, to keep the odometer reading within the narrow 2000 mi covered range. There are also powerful legal deterrents to this way of stealing insurance protection. Odometers have always served as the measuring device for resale value, <b>rental</b> <b>and</b> leasing <b>charges,</b> warranty limits, mechanical breakdown insurance, and cents-per-mile tax deductions or reimbursements for business or government travel. Odometer tampering, detected during claim processing, voids the insurance and, under decades-old state and federal law, is punishable by heavy fines and jail.|$|R
