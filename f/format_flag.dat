5000|$|The {{computer}} uses a full 24 bit {{instruction word}} and data word. Data {{is represented in}} one of two fashions, as a 23 bit binary fraction (full word) or as a 10 bit fraction (split word). The two formats are shown in the figure. Instructions also have two <b>formats,</b> either <b>flagged</b> or unflagged as indicated in the figure. A list with all of the available instructions with numeric and mnemonic codes follows.

50|$|Other {{proposals}} {{considered in}} replacing the old flag involved: incorporating {{the image of}} revered Katipunan figure and Batangas native Apolinario Mabini; incorporating a chevron design; and restoring the old <b>flag</b> <b>format</b> of a plain purple flag with the updated provincial seal in the center.|$|R
5000|$|Catrina Hylton-Hull (aka [...] "Treen"), {{stepdaughter}} of {{the late}} Rod Hull of Emu fame, after numerous auditions, made her first appearance on 11 September 1989. The DJ Kat show did sketches around this time {{in an attempt to}} save the <b>flagging</b> <b>format</b> of the series.|$|R
50|$|Capture the Flag - The {{original}} tournament format, woodsball tournaments of {{any size}} are commonly capture the <b>flag</b> <b>format,</b> {{as well as most}} 3-man or 6-man speedball tournaments, but may also be used with other team sizes. The game starts with a flag at each team's starting station, and the team to capture their opponent's flag and return it to their starting station wins. The National Professional Paintball League plays a 7-man capture the <b>flag</b> <b>format,</b> which was used in the NPPL US Paintball Championship (NPPL Commander's Cup 2005 in Miami) broadcast on ESPN2 in the spring of 2006. 7-man capture the flag is also played by regional tournament series like the Xtreme Paintball Sports League and the New England Paintball League.|$|R
50|$|EFAF is a {{socially}} responsible organization seeking the expansion, popularization, {{and development of}} American Football in Egypt, in both its tackle and <b>flag</b> <b>formats.</b> Faced with challenges through the introducing of the culture, ethics, {{and values of the}} sport, a complete systemic approach was the foundation of the vision, offering constructive training programs and competitions for youth as well as seasoned athletes.|$|R
50|$|The arms of Trinity College, Dublin show two flags, a {{red cross}} on white {{and a red}} saltire on white, which Hayes-McCoy and Galloway {{interpret}} as representing England and Ireland respectively. The arms were granted by Arthur Vicars in 1901, based on a 1612 seal showing uncoloured cross and saltire flags. Bernard Burke's 1864 armory does not specify the <b>flag's</b> <b>format,</b> and nineteenth-century depictions of them vary.|$|R
50|$|After Fox began {{broadcasting}} its sports programming with graphics {{optimized for}} 16:9 displays {{rather than the}} 4:3 safe area in late July 2010, the network asked cable and satellite providers to comply and use the #10 Active <b>Format</b> Description <b>flag</b> it now disseminates over Fox programming, which displays content natively broadcast in 16:9 in a letterboxed format suitable for 4:3 television screens to allow any optimized graphical elements to be displayed in full. Subsequently, a number of Fox O&Os and affiliates also began disseminating the AFD #10 flag over local news and syndicated programs that the stations broadcast in HD, and have incorporated graphical elements seen during local programs and on-air promos (as well as logo bugs) optimized for the letterboxed presentation.|$|R
50|$|The Openclipart library, {{sometimes}} abbreviated as OCAL (Open Clip Art Library), {{was started}} in early 2004 by Jon Phillips and Bryce Harrington, developers for vector graphics software Sodipodi, and later its fork, Inkscape. Openclipart initially {{grew out of a}} project started by Christian Schaller (Uraeus), who on October 26, 2003 issued a challenge on the Gnome Desktop website for users of Sodipodi to create a collection of <b>flags</b> in SVG <b>format.</b> The <b>flag</b> project progressed very well, resulting in a collection of over 90 flags made publicly available in SVG format, which lead to a broadening of the project goals to include generic clipart. The project became known as Openclipart by April 2004, with the stated aim of all contributed images being dedicated to the public domain.|$|R
50|$|MAPLE FLAG {{copied the}} RED <b>FLAG</b> <b>format</b> in 1978 and until 1987, {{it was held}} twice a year, and reduced to once a year after 1987. MAPLE FLAG has only been {{cancelled}} three times all due significant Royal Canadian Air Force commitments, once in 1991, due to Operation Desert Storm, and again in 1999 due to combat operations in Kosovo. In 2011, Maple Flag was cancelled due to NATO military commitments in Libya.|$|R
5000|$|A flag for the Bernese Oberland, {{designed}} by B. v. Rodt, {{was accepted as}} official by the Bernese Executive Council in 1953. It consists of a black eagle in a gold field (in reference to the region's old status as reichsfrei) over two fields in the cantonal colours of red and black. As opposed to most other Swiss flags, which are quadratic, the <b>flag's</b> <b>format</b> is specified as [...] "an upright oblong in the proportions of 23 to 26".|$|R
50|$|On DVDs, telecined {{material}} may {{be either}} hard telecined, or soft telecined. In the hard-telecined case, video is stored on the DVD at the playback framerate (29.97 frame/s for NTSC, 25 frame/s for PAL), using the telecined frames as shown above. In the soft-telecined case, {{the material is}} stored on the DVD at the film rate (24 or 23.976 frames/s) in the original progressive <b>format,</b> with special <b>flags</b> inserted into the MPEG-2 video stream that instruct the DVD player to repeat certain fields so as to accomplish the required pulldown during playback.Progressive scan DVD players additionally offer output at 480p by using these flags to duplicate frames rather than fields.|$|R
5000|$|Speedball leagues {{specify the}} points {{system to be}} used for games. For example, in the NPPL's {{opposing}} <b>flag</b> <b>format,</b> points are awarded for staying in the game the whole round, shooting someone out, grabbing the flag, and hanging the flag. [...] PSP uses the Race2 format, where a match between two teams involves multiple games of center flag; there is a flag {{in the center of the}} field, and a team is awarded a point every time the flag is captured and hung on the opposing team's start box. Teams can play to a certain number of points, or to a set time limit.|$|R
50|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2014 Hall of Fame Game on August 3, 2014, the play clock {{was moved to}} the right side, next to the down/yardage graphic, of the bottom-screen score banner, which itself {{remained}} in the 4:3 safe area. In addition, beginning with the NFL Kickoff Special on September 4, 2014, an electronic green-colored line-of-scrimmage marker was added to the virtual on-field graphic. NBC's Sunday Night Football was also the last of the five NFL broadcast partners to switch to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation on its 4:3 standard-definition feed, a downscaled version of the HD feed's native 16:9 format (utilizing the Active <b>Format</b> Description #10 <b>flag),</b> following Fox (2010), ESPN's Monday Night Football (2011), NFL Network's Thursday Night Football (2012) and CBS (2013). Some of the graphics were also re-positioned.|$|R
40|$|Following the {{confirmation}} by Woodruff (1990) {{that both the}} COADS and the Meteorological Office Marine Data Bank (MDB) contain unique observations, plans are being made for an observation-by-observation blend. A provisional blend of 5 ° latitude x 5 ° longitude monthly sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies yielded much improved coverage in the eastern Pacific in the late 19 th and early 20 th Centuries, affecting estimates of global temperature trends by up to 0. 1 °C. Representation of the major El Niño of 1877 - 8 was substantially improved. A blend of full observations will give further improvements because duplicates can be eliminated, values will be quality controlled, and parameters other than SST will {{be incorporated into the}} expanded data base. Coverage of all data needs to be maximized, to enable a more complete description of climatic variations, and to allow verification of numerical model simulations of decadal to century timescale atmospheric changes forced by large-scale SST changes observed since the late 19 th Century. To this end, data which as yet are neither in COADS nor in the MDB also need {{to be added to the}} blend. A brief resume is given of the logistics involved in the blend. Problems include the criteria for identifying duplicates; the combination of non-identical repeats into single, optimal observations; errors in location and time of observations; exchange <b>formats</b> including <b>flags</b> for quality control, units, and methods of measurement; and the need for regular updates. 1...|$|R
40|$|Gravitational {{waveforms}} from 1824 fiducial {{and detailed}} electron capture simulations, sampled at 65535 Hz. The file is in HDF 5 <b>format,</b> using the <b>flags</b> {dtype="f 4 ",compression="gzip",shuffle=True,fletcher 32 =True}. Each group {{is contained in}} the "waveforms" top-level group and is named with the "A" and "omega_ 0 " values from Equation 5 and the EOS. In each sub-group is a dataset containing timestamps in seconds (t= 0 is core bounce) and a dataset containing the strain multiplied by the distance in centimeters. The values of A in kilometers, omega_ 0 in radians/s, and the EOS are stored as attributes of each group. In addition, the Ye(rho) profiles are stored in the "yeofrho" top-level group. Each sub-group is labeled by the EOS used to generate the profile. Finally, select reduced data is stored in the "reduced_data" top-level group.
