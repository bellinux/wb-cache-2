Declining gender differentials <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U. S., and the more rapid closing of <b>the</b> gender pay <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.

5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large provincial town, with a {{population}} of around 5,000. The raising of money through murage grants began again in 1321, possibly paying for the stone towers of the Bargate and some of the semi-circular wall towers. Work also appears to have begun on some stone walling to the south and west of the town, construction may have begun at the South Gate and a wooden barbican was constructed near the western docks. Later investigations by the Crown would suggest that some of the monies raised in these murage grants had been misspent, however, contributing to the poor standard of town defences, which included large <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> walled circuit.|$|E
5|$|Data {{from the}} Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere {{satellite}} suggests that noctilucent clouds require water vapour, dust, and very cold temperatures to form.

The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the stratosphere.|$|E

5|$|From West Main Street to South Avenue, {{the bridge}} {{supports}} were largely built with concrete while the supports on the section between Brown Street and West Main Street were mostly built with steel.

5|$|In 1917, {{during the}} battle of Cambrai, the Tank Corps adopted new tactics.

The effectiveness of tank–infantry co-operation was demonstrated {{during the battle}}, when Major General George Montague Harper of the 51st (Highland) Division refused to co-operate with the tanks, a decision that compelled them to move forward without any infantry support; the result was the destruction of more than 12 tanks by German artillery sighted behind bunkers.|$|E
