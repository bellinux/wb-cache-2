40|$|Q: What the {{difference}} between noise <b>gain</b> and signal <b>gain?</b> A: In the closing of RAQ 56, Amplifier, attenuator or both?, I indicated that you can force the noise <b>gain</b> (NG) while maintaining the signal <b>gain.</b> In a brief recap from op amp theory, two types of <b>gain</b> are associated with op amps: signal <b>gain</b> and noise <b>gain.</b> The signal <b>gain</b> {{is dependent on the}} amplifier configuration. With noninverting op amp configurations, the <b>gain</b> equation is G = (RF /RG) + 1; with inverting configurations, the <b>gain</b> is G = – RF/RG. The noise <b>gain</b> for both of these configurations is the same, and follows the same equation as the noninverting gain: NG = (RF /RG) + 1. The amplifier’s stability in a circuit is determined by the noise <b>gain,</b> not the signal <b>gain.</b> Most modern op amps are stable at unity <b>gain,</b> but some special-purpose amplifiers are not. Decompensated op amps can offer unique advantages, such as lower noise voltage and wider bandwidth, as compared to standard unity-gain stable op amps. So, in what situations would you need to manipulate the noise <b>gain?</b> Forcing the noise <b>gain</b> can help in a variety of applications. For example, to take advantage of one or more of its features, you may want to use a decompensated amplifier below its minimum stable <b>gain.</b> Normally it wouldn’t work, but if you manipulate the noise <b>gain,</b> you can “trick ” the amplifier int...|$|R
