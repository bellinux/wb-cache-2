25|$|The Grade {{monoplane}} was a single-seat aircraft {{constructed by}} Hans Grade in 1909. It {{was the first}} successful <b>heavier-than-air</b> <b>aircraft</b> produced in Germany, and around 80 were eventually built.|$|E
25|$|The German {{scouting}} force, {{commanded by}} Franz Hipper, consisted of five battlecruisers, five light cruisers and 30 torpedo-boats. The Germans had no equivalent to Engadine and no <b>heavier-than-air</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{to operate with}} the fleet but had the Imperial German Naval Airship Service's force of rigid airships available to patrol the North Sea.|$|E

50|$|The above {{requirements}} are for <b>heavier-than-air</b> powered <b>aircraft</b> (airplanes). The requirements for gliders, balloons, gyroplanes, and dirigibles vary slightly.|$|R
2500|$|In 1910, {{just seven}} {{years after the first}} <b>heavier-than-air</b> flight, <b>aircraft</b> are fragile and {{unreliable}} contraptions, piloted by [...] "intrepid birdmen".|$|R
25|$|A glider is a <b>heavier-than-air</b> <b>aircraft</b> that is {{supported}} in flight by the dynamic {{reaction of the}} air against its lifting surfaces, and whose free flight {{does not depend on}} an engine. Most gliders do not have an engine, although motor-gliders have small engines for extending their flight when necessary with some being powerful enough to take off.|$|E
25|$|In Germany {{the great}} {{successes of the}} early Zeppelin {{airships}} had largely overshadowed the importance of <b>heavier-than-air</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Out of a paper strength of about 230 aircraft belonging to the army in August 1914 only 180 or so were of any use. The French military aviation exercises of 1911, 1912, and 1913 had pioneered cooperation with the cavalry (reconnaissance) and artillery (spotting), but the momentum was if anything slacking.|$|E
25|$|His {{flight of}} 16 October 1908 is {{recognised}} {{as the first}} official flight of a piloted heavier-than-air machine in Great Britain. The machine was damaged {{at the end of}} the flight. After repairs and extensive modifications, Cody flew it again, early in 1909. The War Office then decided to stop backing development of <b>heavier-than-air</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and Cody's contract with the Army ended in April 1909. Cody was given the aircraft, and continued to work on the aircraft at Farnborough, using Laffan's Plain for his test flights.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>heavier-than-air</b> (HTA) <b>aircraft,</b> {{especially}} rotorcraft, require the constant {{use of power}} to generate lift, and conventional airplanes also require runways.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the Order created Named Memberships for {{current or former}} {{military}} pilots of <b>heavier-than-air</b> powered <b>aircraft.</b> This expansion ensured {{a new source of}} members for the Order. Later changes allowed female commissioned pilots to join. In 2001 membership criteria were changed to authorize memberships for ex-commissioned officers, whether or not they retired, and for all Flight officers and warrant officers who held ratings as military pilots of <b>heavier-than-air</b> powered <b>aircraft.</b> In 2002 membership criteria were again changed to authorize memberships for WASPs.|$|R
50|$|The Wright {{brothers}} {{made the}} first successful powered, controlled and sustained airplane flight on December 17, 1903, a feat made possible by their invention of three-axis control. Only a decade later, {{at the start of}} World War I, <b>heavier-than-air</b> powered <b>aircraft</b> had become practical for reconnaissance, artillery spotting, and even attacks against ground positions.|$|R
25|$|The Tony Jannus Award recognizes {{outstanding}} {{individual achievement}} in scheduled commercial aviation by airline executives, inventors and manufacturers, and government leaders. The award is conferred annually by the Tony Jannus Distinguished Aviation Society and was first bestowed in 1964 in Tampa, Florida, U.S. Its namesake, aviation pioneer Tony Jannus (1889October 12, 1916), piloted the inaugural {{flight of the}} St. Petersburg–Tampa Airboat Line on January 1, 1914, the first scheduled commercial airline flight in the world using <b>heavier-than-air</b> <b>aircraft.</b> In addition to preserving the legacy of Tony Jannus, the non-profit Society also offers financial assistance to college students pursuing studies in aviation and conducts an annual essay contest {{for high school students}} to encourage careers in aviation.|$|E
25|$|The 1955 Hawaii R6D-1 {{crash was}} an {{accident}} involving a Douglas R6D-1 Liftmaster of the United States Navy which crashed into a mountain peak in Hawaii on 22 March 1955, killing all 66 people on board. At the time, {{it was the worst}} crash involving any variant of the Douglas DC-6 airliner the second-worst aviation accident in U.S. history, and one of the worst air accidents anywhere in history, and it equalled the 11 August mid-air collision of two United States Air Force C-119G Flying Boxcars over West Germany and the 6 October United Airlines Flight 409 crash as the deadliest air accident of 1955. It remains the worst air disaster in the history of Hawaii and the deadliest accident involving a <b>heavier-than-air</b> <b>aircraft</b> in the history of United States naval aviation.|$|E
25|$|Two of the Royal Flying Corps' early Bristol Scout C aircraft, numbers 1609 and 1611, {{flown by}} Captain Lanoe Hawker with No. 6 Squadron RFC, were each, in their turn – as 1609 was {{written-off}} from combat damage, 1611 received its gun mount hardware as its replacement—armed with a Lewis machine {{gun on the}} left side of the fuselage, almost identical to the manner of the rifles tried on the second Scout B, using a mount that Hawker had designed. When Hawker downed two German aircraft and forced off a third on 25 July 1915 over Passchendaele and Zillebeke he was awarded the first-ever Victoria Cross for the actions of a British single-seat military scout/fighter pilot in aerial combat against an enemy's <b>heavier-than-air</b> <b>aircraft,</b> following the earlier VC awards to William Rhodes-Moorhouse (flying a B.E.2 two-seat observation biplane) and Reginald Warneford (flying against an enemy Zeppelin) in April and June 1915 respectively.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>heavier-than-air,</b> powered <b>aircraft</b> {{flight in}} Canada and the British Empire {{occurred}} on 23 February 1909 when Alexander Graham Bell's Silver Dart {{took off from}} the ice of Bras d'Or Lake at Baddeck, Nova Scotia with J.A.D. McCurdy at the controls. The 1/2-mile flight {{was followed by a}} longer flight of 20 miles on 10 March 1909.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the first}} {{successful}} attempt to fly a <b>heavier-than-air</b> fixed-wing <b>aircraft</b> solely on steam power occurred in 1933, when George and William Besler converted a Travel Air 2000 biplane to fly on a 150 hp angle-compound V-twin steam engine of their own design {{instead of the usual}} Curtiss OX-5 inline or radial aviation gasoline engine it would have normally used.|$|R
50|$|The Wright Flyer (often {{retrospectively}} {{referred to}} as Flyer I or 1903 Flyer) was the first successful <b>heavier-than-air</b> powered <b>aircraft.</b> It was designed and built by the Wright brothers. They flew it four times on December 17, 1903, near Kill Devil Hills, about four miles south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, US. Today, the airplane is exhibited in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C.|$|R
500|$|Beatty ordered Engadine to make {{a search}} to the {{north-northeast}} at 14:40 and she sailed through the BCF before turning north-east to find calmer water. At 15:07 Lieutenant Frederick Rutland took off in his Type 184 and his observer signalled Engadine that they had spotted three German cruisers and five destroyers at 15:30. These were ships from the II Scouting Group, leading the battlecruisers of Vice Admiral Franz von Hipper. This {{was the first time}} that a <b>heavier-than-air</b> <b>aircraft</b> had carried out a reconnaissance of an enemy fleet in action. After a few other spot reports were transmitted, the aircraft's fuel line ruptured around 15:36 and Rutland was forced to put his aircraft down. He was able to repair it and signalled that he was ready to take off again, but he was ordered to taxi to the carrier on the surface. The aircraft reached the ship at 15:47 and it was hoisted aboard by 16:04. By this time, a pair of destroyers, [...] and , that had been ordered to protect Engadine while she was stationary had reached her. Engadine attempted to relay the spot reports to Beatty's flagship and the flagship of the 5th Battle Squadron, but was unsuccessful. She trailed Beatty's force during the [...] "Run to the South", during which time her two escorts were detached and again when they reversed course during the [...] "Run to the North".|$|E
2500|$|In 1891, Bell {{had begun}} {{experiments}} to develop motor-powered <b>heavier-than-air</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The AEA was first formed as Bell shared the vision to fly with his wife, who {{advised him to}} seek [...] "young" [...] help as Bell was {{at the age of}} 60.|$|E
2500|$|The Paris International Conference had {{allocated}} the British Empire the prefix G {{followed by}} four other letters. The United Kingdom {{decided to use}} the G-Exxx sequence for <b>heavier-than-air</b> <b>aircraft</b> (for example G-EAAA) and [...] "G-Fxxx" [...] for lighter-than-air aircraft. The new register came into force on 22 July 1919; aircraft flying on temporary former military serials and those allotted in the K-100 sequence were all re-registered sequentially from G-EAAA.|$|E
5000|$|Acosta later {{recalled}} that upon her first landing, Santos-Dumont {{asked her how}} she had fared. [...] "It is very nice, M. Santos-Dumont," [...] she replied. [...] "Mademoiselle," [...] he cried, [...] "vous êtes la première aero-chauffeuse du monde!" [...] ("Miss, you are the first woman aero-driver in the world!"). She {{was in fact the}} first woman to pilot any kind of motorized aircraft, nearly six months before the Wright brothers first flew in a <b>heavier-than-air</b> powered <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
50|$|Under the {{designation}} system established in April 1947, the first N-class airships {{were given the}} Navy designation of ZPN-1, (Z = lighter-than-air; P = patrol; N = type/class). In April 1954, {{the designation}} system was changed to mimic that used for <b>heavier-than-air</b> naval <b>aircraft.</b> With this change, the designation for the ZPN-1 became the ZPG-1 (Z = lighter-than-air; P = patrol; G=Goodyear (manufacturer); 1=first version). In the 1962 system, the ZPG-1 designation was changed to SZ-1A (S=anti-submarine warfare; Z=lighter-than-air type; 1=first vehicle in the type; A=first model in the series). The designations for later model blimps followed similarly.|$|R
2500|$|Voisin was a French {{aircraft}} manufacturing company, one of {{the first}} in the world. It was established in 1906 by Gabriel Voisin and his brother Charles, and was continued by Gabriel after Charles died in an automobile accident in 1912; the full official company name then became Société Anonyme des Aéroplanes G. Voisin (...) [...] It created Europe's first manned, <b>heavier-than-air</b> powered <b>aircraft</b> capable of a sustained (1km), circular, controlled flight, including take-off and landing, the Voisin-Farman I. On 28 December 1909, French aviator M. Albert Kimmerling made the first manned, heavier-than-air powered flight in South Africa or even Africa in a Voisin 1907 biplane.|$|R
2500|$|His {{forecast}} for practical aviation (i.e., <b>heavier-than-air</b> <b>aircraft)</b> was negative. In 1896 he refused {{an invitation to}} join the Aeronautical Society, writing that [...] "I have not the smallest molecule of faith in aerial navigation other than ballooning or of expectation of good results {{from any of the}} trials we hear of." [...] And in a 1902 newspaper interview he predicted that [...] "No balloon and no aeroplane will ever be practically successful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reginald Bacon {{had left}} the Navy in 1909 and [...] "Jackie" [...] Fisher, who was an {{advocate}} of airship development was no longer First Sea Lord. Winston Churchill, who became the First Lord of the Admiralty on 24 October 1911 was generally dismissive of airships, favouring the development of <b>heavier-than-air</b> <b>aircraft.</b> [...] As a result, no {{attempt was made to}} repair the Mayfly and it was left to rot in its shed.|$|E
2500|$|From 1891, Bell {{had begun}} {{experiments}} at Baddeck and Hammondsport to develop motor-powered <b>heavier-than-air</b> <b>aircraft.</b> By 1908, {{the success of}} the AEA was seen in a series of ground-breaking designs, culminating in the Silver Dart. [...] By the time the Silver Dart was constructed in late 1908, it was the Aerial Experiment Association's fourth flying machine. One of its precursors, the June Bug, had already broken records. It won the Scientific American Trophy for making the first official one mile (1609 m) flight in North America.|$|E

50|$|The Wright Brothers, {{in search}} of a light and strong {{covering}} for their gliders and the 1903 Wright Flyer (the first <b>heavier-than-air</b> powered <b>aircraft),</b> selected Pride of the West muslin as a covering for wings and control surfaces. A large piece of the fabric used on the original Wright Flyer (1903) was passed down to Wright descendants. The fabric was made available to The Wright Experience(reproduction of the Wright gliders and Flyer and reenactment of the first flight on its 100th anniversary) for examination as it was no longer commercially available a century after its use by the Wrights. To create an authentic modern reproduction of the original fabric, three different companies were needed which produced the thread, the weaving, and the finishing).|$|R
50|$|While the British {{were not}} the first to make use of <b>heavier-than-air</b> {{military}} <b>aircraft,</b> the RAF is the world's oldest independent air force: that is, the first air force to become independent of army or navy control. It was founded on 1 April 1918, with headquarters located in the former Hotel Cecil, during the First World War, by the amalgamation of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). At that time it was the largest air force in the world. After the war, the service was drastically cut and its inter-war years were relatively quiet, with the RAF taking responsibility for the control of Iraq and executing a number of minor actions {{in other parts of the}} British Empire. The RAF's naval aviation branch, the Fleet Air Arm, was founded in 1924 but handed over to Admiralty control on 24 May 1939.|$|R
2500|$|Among British {{politicians}} and journalists who grossly exaggerated the material {{effects of the}} [...] "Scourge" [...] were the eminent pioneering aviation journalist C.G. Grey, founder of The Aeroplane, {{one of the first}} aviation magazines, and Noel Pemberton Billing M.P., a notably unsuccessful aircraft designer and manufacturer. Their supposed object was the replacement of the B.E.2c with better aircraft, but it took the form of an attack on the RFC command and the Royal Aircraft Factory. C.G. Grey had orchestrated a campaign against the Royal Aircraft Factory in the pages of The Aeroplane, going back to its period as the Balloon Factory, well before it had produced any <b>heavier-than-air</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Opinions such {{as those}} {{expressed}} by The New York Times that the [...] "War Dirigibles Must Yield to the Aeroplane" [...] and [...] "France Loses Faith in Army Balloons - Loss of Four Lives in La République Accident Turns Public Favor to Aeroplanes" [...] reflected a growing awareness of the relative potentials of airships and aeroplanes, although all major powers continued to invest in military airships for some years. Airships were to be used throughout most of World War I, before their vulnerability to improved <b>heavier-than-air</b> <b>aircraft</b> led to their being abandoned for military purposes; the British military Airship Branch was disbanded in 1921.|$|E
2500|$|Langley {{attempted}} to make a working piloted <b>heavier-than-air</b> <b>aircraft.</b> His models flew, but his two attempts at piloted flight were not successful. Langley began experimenting with rubber-band powered models and gliders in 1887. [...] (According to one book, {{he was not able}} to reproduce Alphonse Pénaud's time aloft with rubber power but persisted anyway.) He built a rotating arm (functioning like a wind tunnel) and made larger flying models powered by miniature steam engines. Langley realised that sustained powered flight was possible when he found that a 1lb. brass plate suspended from the rotating arm by a spring, could be kept aloft by a spring tension of less than 1 oz.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, a {{research}} effort {{carried out at}} the School of Aeronautics at Cranfield University, commissioned by the BBC2 television series [...] "Horizon", has shown that Pilcher's design {{was more or less}} workable, and had he been able to develop his engine, it is possible he would have succeeded in being the first to fly a <b>heavier-than-air</b> powered <b>aircraft</b> with some degree of control. Cranfield built a replica of Pilcher's aircraft and added the Wright brothers' innovation of wing-warping as a safety backup for roll control. Pilcher's original design did not include aerodynamic controls such as ailerons or elevator. After a very short initial test flight piloted by the aircraft designer Bill Brookes, the craft achieved a sustained flight of 1 minute and 25 seconds, compared to 59 seconds for the Wright Brothers' best flight at Kitty Hawk. This was achieved under dead calm conditions as an additional safety measure;the Wrights in 1903 flew in a 20 mph+ wind to achieve sufficient airspeed.|$|R
5000|$|While the British {{were not}} the first to make use of <b>heavier-than-air</b> {{military}} <b>aircraft,</b> the RAF is the world's oldest independent air force: that is, the first air force to become independent of army or navy control. [...] The RAF was founded on 1 April 1918 by the amalgamation of the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service and was controlled by the British Government Air Ministry which had been established three months earlier. The Royal Flying Corps had been born out of the Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers and was {{under the control of the}} British Army. The Royal Naval Air Service was its naval equivalent and was controlled by the Admiralty. The decision to merge the two services and create an independent air force was a response to the events of World War I, the first war in which air power made a significant impact. The creation of the new force was based on the Smuts Report prepared by Field Marshal Jan Smuts for the Imperial War Cabinet on which he served.|$|R
