Marge assures him {{he has nothing to}} be afraid of, but a green fog seeps <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> window and the Simpsons are turned inside out. They, along with Willie, perform a musical number over the end credits, but Bart is dragged away and eviscerated by Santa's Little Helper.|$|E
5|$|Beagles may {{exhibit a}} {{behaviour}} known as reverse sneezing, {{in which they}} sound {{as if they are}} choking or gasping for breath, but are actually drawing air <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mouth and nose. The exact cause of this behaviour is not known, but it can be a common occurrence and is not harmful to the dog.|$|E
5|$|Home met one of {{his future}} closest friends in 1867; the young Lord Adare (later the 4th Earl of Dunraven). Adare was fascinated by Home, and began documenting the séances they held. The {{following}} year, Home {{was said to have}} levitated out of the third storey window of one room, and back <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> window of the adjoining room in front of three witnesses (Adare, Captain Wynne, and Lord Lindsay).|$|E

50|$|Lattices are of {{interest}} {{in many areas of}} mathematics: geometric group theory (as particularly nice examples of discrete groups), <b>in</b> differential geometry (<b>through</b> <b>the</b> construction of locally homogeneous manifolds), <b>in</b> number theory (<b>through</b> arithmetic groups), <b>in</b> ergodic theory (<b>through</b> <b>the</b> study of homogeneous flows on the quotient spaces) and <b>in</b> combinatorics (<b>through</b> <b>the</b> construction of expanding Cayley graphs and other combinatorial objects).|$|R
5|$|In November 1978, {{the group}} {{recorded}} at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The resulting album, <b>In</b> <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> Out Door, featured sonic experimentation that again drew mixed reactions from critics. Nevertheless, the album reached {{number one in}} the UK and the US in just its second week of release. With this album's release, Led Zeppelin's entire catalogue returned to the Billboard Top 200 in the weeks of 27 October and 3 November 1979.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. Heat is {{constantly}} lost from the body. Food products reach {{the heart and}} are processed into new blood, releasing fire during metabolism, which raises the blood temperature too high. That raises the heart temperature, causing lung volume to increase, in turn raising the airflow at the mouth. The cool air brought <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mouth reduces the heart temperature, so the lung volume accordingly decreases, restoring the temperature to normal.|$|E
5|$|A few bivalves, {{such as the}} {{granular}} poromya (Poromya granulata), are carnivorous, eating {{much larger}} prey than the tiny microalgae consumed by other bivalves. In these animals, the gills are relatively small, and form a perforated barrier separating the main mantle cavity from a smaller chamber through which the water is exhaled. Muscles draw water <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> inhalant siphon which is modified into a cowl-shaped organ, sucking in small crustaceans and worms at the same time. The siphon can be retracted quickly and inverted, bringing the prey within reach of the mouth. The gut is modified so that large food particles can be digested.|$|E

5|$|A {{film of the}} O2 performance, Celebration Day, premiered on 17 October 2012 and was {{released}} on home video on 19 November. The film grossed $2 million in one night, and the live album peaked at number 4 and 9 in the UK and US, respectively. Following the film's premiere, Page revealed {{that he had been}} remastering the band's discography. The first wave of albums, Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin II, and Led Zeppelin III, were released on 2 June 2014. The second wave of albums, Led Zeppelin IV and Houses of the Holy, were released on 27 October 2014. Physical Graffiti {{was released}} on 23 February 2015, almost exactly forty years to the day after the original release. The fourth and final wave of albums, Presence, <b>In</b> <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> Out Door, and Coda, were released on 31 July 2015.|$|E
5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the battle}} {{something}} went wrong. While engaging the French galleys the Mary Rose suddenly heeled (leaned) heavily over to her starboard (right) side and water rushed <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> open gunports. The crew was powerless to correct the sudden imbalance, and could only scramble {{for the safety of}} the upper deck as the ship began to sink rapidly. As she leaned over, equipment, ammunition, supplies and storage containers shifted and came loose, adding to the general chaos. The massive port side brick oven in the galley collapsed completely and the huge 360-litre (90 gallon) copper cauldron was thrown onto the orlop deck above. Heavy guns came free and slammed into the opposite side, impeding escape or crushing men beneath them.|$|E

5|$|In the 13th century, the Mongol leader Genghis Khan, once a vassal of the Jurchens, rose {{up against}} the Jin dynasty. In the ensuing Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty, the nomadic invaders avoided direct attacks on the Jin fortifications. Instead, when they could, the Mongols simply rode around the walls; an {{effective}} example of this tactic is in 1211, when they circumvented the substantial fortress in Zhangjiakou and inflicted a terrible defeat upon the Jin armies at the Battle of Yehuling. The Mongols also took advantage of lingering Liao resentment against the Jin; the Khitan defenders of the garrisons along the Jin walls, {{such as those in}} Gubeikou, often preferred to surrender to the Mongols rather than fight them. The only major engagement of note along the main Great Wall line was at the heavily defended Juyong Pass: instead of laying siege, the Mongol general Jebe lured the defenders out into an ambush and charged <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> opened gates. In 1215, Genghis Khan besieged, captured, and sacked the Jin capital of Yanjing (modern-day Beijing). The Jin dynasty eventually collapsed following the siege of Caizhou in 1234. Western Xia had already fallen in 1227, and the Southern Song resisted the Mongols until 1279.|$|E
5|$|Led Zeppelin's {{untitled}} fourth album, {{often called}} Led Zeppelin IV and released on 8 November 1971, is their most commercially successful album. It received a 23 times multi-platinum certification from RIAA, the third-highest of all albums. The band's fifth album, Houses of the Holy, {{was released in}} 1973. Again a transatlantic chart-topper, it has received an 11 times multi-platinum certification from RIAA. In 1974, the band {{set up their own}} vanity label, Swan Song Records, which would release the rest of Led Zeppelin's studio albums. The first was the 1975 double album Physical Graffiti, which has received a 16 times platinum certification from RIAA. However, Zeppelin's seventh album, Presence (1976), did not perform as well as their previous releases, receiving a triple Platinum certification from RIAA. On 20 October 1976 Led Zeppelin released their first concert film The Song Remains the Same. The recording of the film took place during three nights of concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York City, during the band's 1973 concert tour of the United States. The band's eighth album, <b>In</b> <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> Out Door, received a sextuple platinum certification. This was the last album released by the band before Bonham died of alcohol intoxication in 1980; Led Zeppelin disbanded immediately afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Mulder visits Max's trailer {{again and}} looks through his mail, finding a luggage claim ticket. Scully visits Sharon, {{now in a}} mental institution, who tells Scully that she stole {{technology}} from her employer that Max believed was alien. The device was in three parts, one which she had, one that he brought {{on the plane and}} a third one. Mulder uses the claim ticket to obtain the third device at a New York airport and heads on a plane to return to Washington. Garrett, who is also aboard, sits next to him. Mulder soon realizes who Garrett is and holds him at gunpoint. Garrett does not care, telling Mulder that if he shoots him the plane will depressurize and {{he will be able to}} escape with a parachute he has with him. Mulder imprisons Garrett in the airplane bathroom but Garrett soon emerges with a zip gun and orders him to hand over the device. Suddenly the plane starts shaking and bright lights shine <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> windows. When the plane touches down and Mulder gets out both Garrett and the device are gone and Mulder is missing nine minutes, having no memory of what happened. The agents visit Sharon one last time in Max's trailer and say goodbye.|$|E

5|$|Ryouta, {{searching for}} a way into the medical center basement, seeks out Nageki in the library {{to ask him about}} his death. Upon {{discovering}} documents revealing that Operation Hatoful was a Hawk Party project into developing biological weapons for use against humans using the school as an experimental facility—with a focus on a strain of H5N1 almost immediately lethal to humans dubbed the Charon virus—Nageki recalls that the fire was caused by his committing suicide by self-immolation after months of forced experimentation in order to destroy and remove any trace of the virus, which was isolated in his body, and that researchers often went <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> chemistry preparation room. Ryouta, Kazuaki, and Anghel make their way into the medical center's basement through the chemistry lab and encounter Labor 9, electrocuting it using a stun gun given to Ryouta earlier by Mister One. They confront Shuu, who imprisons Kazuaki and Anghel, leaving them to die of poison gas before leading Ryouta away. Meanwhile, San comforts Sakuya, {{and the two of them}} arrive to break Anghel and Kazuaki out of the prison.|$|E
5|$|Since 1980, the {{surviving}} members have sporadically collaborated {{and participated in}} one-off reunions, the most successful being the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert, with Jason Bonham taking his late father's place behind the drums. After {{the release of the}} concert film Celebration Day, Page announced the remastering of the band's discography in the form of deluxe editions. The first wave of albums, Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin II, and Led Zeppelin III, were released on 2 June 2014. The next two albums, Led Zeppelin IV and Houses of the Holy, were released on 27 October 2014.

5|$|Supplies {{had been}} brought <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> air and via the Mexican navy {{containing}} food, blankets, and medicine early on October2. However, additional bad weather initially prevented further supplies from coming in. Around that time, President Echeverria ordered emergency aid to be sent La Paz, Los Mochis, and Ciudad Obregon, as well as three coastal Sonoran ports. In addition, officials set up tents to house 40,000homeless persons. Meanwhile, city officials appealed for additional food, medicine, and construction materials. Gerald Ford, {{who was then the}} U.S. president, agreed to provide aid for victims of Hurricane Liza; the first of which arrived late on October2, containing food and construction materials. The next day, power had been restored to hospitals, government centers, and gas stations. The government said that it was rushing in 100,000meals as well as 40,000temporary shelters the first of which started to arrive on October5. within a week after the storm, however, one survivor of the storm noted that plenty of food had arrived from many places.|$|E

5|$|The {{country has}} {{developed}} into a centre of Islamic banking, and is {{the country with the}} highest numbers of female workers in that industry. Knowledge-based services are also expanding. To create a self-reliant defensive ability and support national development, Malaysia privatised some of its military facilities in the 1970s. The privatisation has created defence industry, which in 1999 was brought under the Malaysia Defence Industry Council. The government continues to promote this sector and its competitiveness, actively marketing the defence industry. Science policies in Malaysia are regulated by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation. The country is one of the world's largest exporters of semiconductor devices, electrical devices, and IT and communication products. Malaysia began developing its own space programme in 2002, and in 2006, Russia agreed to transport one Malaysian to the International Space Station as part of a multibillion-dollar purchase of 18 Russian Sukhoi Su-30MKM fighter jets by the Royal Malaysian Air Force. The government has invested in building satellites <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> RazakSAT programme.|$|E
5|$|The major {{means of}} {{respiration}} in teleosts, {{as in most}} other fish, is the transfer of gases {{over the surface of}} the gills as water is drawn <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mouth and pumped out through the gills. Apart from the swim bladder, which contains a small amount of air, the body does not have oxygen reserves, and respiration needs to be continuous over the fish's life. Some teleosts exploit habitats where the oxygen availability is low, such as stagnant water or wet mud; they have developed accessory tissues and organs to support gas exchange in these habitats.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} frog is {{permeable}} to {{oxygen and}} carbon dioxide, {{as well as to}} water. There are blood vessels near the surface of the skin and when a frog is underwater, oxygen diffuses directly into the blood. When not submerged, a frog breathes by a process known as buccal pumping. Its lungs {{are similar to those of}} humans, but the chest muscles are not involved in respiration, and no ribs or diaphragm exist to help move air in and out. Instead, it puffs out its throat and draws air <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> nostrils, which in many species can then be closed by valves. When the floor of the mouth is compressed, air is forced into the lungs. The fully aquatic Bornean flat-headed frog (Barbourula kalimantanensis) is the first frog known to lack lungs entirely.|$|E
