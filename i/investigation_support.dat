50|$|Community Safety Officers (CSO): In 2008, a new pilot {{designation}} {{within the}} RCMP in British Columbia was created {{based on the}} UK Police Community Support Officer program.

5000|$|According to the {{newspaper}} Davar, which carried out investigations in Haviv's household, his family had {{held on to the}} hope that he would be saved through a visit by the UN council. Haviv sent a message to his family: [...] "We are ready to sabotage, the question is how ready are you for it?" [...] On the 29th of Tammuz, anniversary of the release of Irgun leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky, Haviv and the two other condemned men were promoted from group leader (rosh kvutza) to sergeant (samal). The Irgun approached the UN council and asked them to annul the death sentence. This was in light of the UN calling on all sides to refrain from violence during the investigation, and also based on a similar event that had occurred in Greece along with the fact that no one from the security forces lost their life in the attack on the Acre Prison [...] - [...] the only victims were underground fighters. During the UN council <b>investigation,</b> <b>support</b> developed for intervention in the affair, but after the matter was brought to the chairman of the council and after stormy deliberations behind closed doors, it was decided on June 23 not to adopt a position contrary to the decision of the British mandate. A hostile government request for a conference concerning the three convicts worsened relations between the parties, and shortened the duration of the UN Council's stay. David Ben-Gurion, Chaim Weizmann, and the chief rabbis, all pleaded with the chief commissioner for amnesty. Many other bodies joined in the call for amnesty, including the council of the Sephardic union, the council of Ramat Gan, American students, and even the New York Post and Czech newspapers.|$|E
