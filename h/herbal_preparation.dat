25|$|A {{number of}} salts of {{morphine}} are used, {{with the most}} common in current clinical use being the hydrochloride, sulfate, tartrate, and citrate; less commonly methobromide, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, lactate, chloride, and bitartrate and the others listed below. Morphine diacetate, which is another name for heroin, is a Schedule I controlled substance, {{so it is not}} used clinically in the United States; it is a sanctioned medication in the United Kingdom and in Canada and some countries in Continental Europe, its use being particularly common (nearly to the degree of the hydrochloride salt) in the United Kingdom. Morphine meconate is a major form of the alkaloid in the poppy, as is morphine pectinate, nitrate, sulphate, and some others. Like codeine, dihydrocodeine and other (especially older) opiates, morphine has been used as the salicylate salt by some suppliers and can be easily compounded, imparting the therapeutic advantage of both the opioid and the NSAID; multiple barbiturate salts of morphine were also used in the past, as was/is morphine valerate, the salt of the acid being the active principle of valerian. Calcium morphenate is the intermediate in various latex and poppy-straw methods of morphine production, more rarely sodium morphenate takes its place. Morphine ascorbate and other salts such as the tannate, citrate, and acetate, phosphate, valerate and others may be present in poppy tea depending on the method of preparation. Morphine valerate produced industrially was one ingredient of a medication available for both oral and parenteral administration popular many years ago in Europe and elsewhere called Trivalin (not {{to be confused with the}} current, unrelated <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> of the same name), which also included the valerates of caffeine and cocaine, with a version containing codeine valerate as a fourth ingredient being distributed under the name Tetravalin.|$|E

40|$|According to data of {{research}} company „IMS Health“ the pharmacy market in Lithuania increases year by year, {{and sales of}} non-prescribed medicine increase significantly. A part of those sales is comprised of <b>herbal</b> medicine <b>preparations.</b> Analysis of competitive environment, analysis of available preparations portfolio and possibilities of the company‘s development are compulsory seeking to stay competitive. During the last years we observed an increasing interest of consumers in <b>herbal</b> medicine <b>preparations,</b> therefore, the topic chosen is relevant for the Master‘s Degree thesis. Aim of the study: to evaluate possibilities of development of „Bionorica AG“ company on Lithuanian market. Objectives: Review of market of <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations,</b> evaluation of external environment, analysis of portfolio of the company‘s preparations, possibilities {{and analysis of the}} company‘s development on the market. Methods – model of M. Porter, with the help of which competitive analysis was performed. Survey of drugstores. Questionnaire data of surveys were entered, processed and analyzed with the use of statistics data analysis program SPSS. Analysis of the products‘ portfolio was performed with the use of matrix model of Boston consulting group (BCG). Possibilities of the company‘s development are analyzed in the paper with the use of forecasting method - trend model. Results: Many large companies, which follow each others‘ actions in order to know the means that are necesary to be assumed seeking to stay competitive, are operating on the market of <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations.</b> The market of <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> according to its features belongs to the market according to the role being played and is oriented towards the segment of the city‘s residents. In the EU countries and Lithuania use of <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> increases. In Lithuania having an increase of sales of non-prescribed medicine, the part of sales of <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> increases identically. In Lithuania, there are 33 medicine manufacturers that sell <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations.</b> In Lithuania, there are 9 companies that manufacture <b>herbal</b> medicine <b>preparations.</b> The final consumer has an insignificant influence on the company. Constant danger of alternate materials from the side of homeopathic and chemical preparations and food products of medicical purpose is observed. New preparations appear. The biggest part of the surveyed stated that popularity of <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> had increased during the last two years. The majority of drugstores give preference to the companies that offer the most attractive price and specials organized by wholesale companies. According to the respondents‘ opinion television, radio and press advertisement has the biggest influence on the final consumer. The surveyed also stated that those can influence the customer‘s decision occasionally. Having analyzed the preparations portfolio of „Bionorica AG“ company, we can observe a positive tendency of increase of preparations‘ sale. The most popular preparation (in the portfolio) is Sinupret. This medicine occupies the biggest part of market. Conclusions: Market of <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> is categorized as oligopoly market. Increasing popularity of <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> in the EU countries will {{have a positive effect on}} Lithuanian market of <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations.</b> The main competititors on the market of <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> are German companies. The company has to adjust the strategy of its actvity, if it seeks to stay a competitive company further on the market. We can make a conclusion that having reviewed the strategy of actvity, the company‘s directors have to pay the biggest part of attention to the segment of women of 36 – 55 years of age. The tendency of increase of sales of the company‘s preparations is positive. The most attractive segment of the market is medicine from cough and cold...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND—Asthma {{is one of}} {{the most}} common chronic {{diseases}} in modern society and there is increasing evidence to suggest that its incidence and severity are increasing. There is a high prevalence of usage of complementary medicine for asthma. <b>Herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> have been cited as the third most popular complementary treatment modality by British asthma sufferers. This study was undertaken to determine if there is any evidence for the clinical efficacy of <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> for the treatment of asthma symptoms.  METHODS—Four independent literature searches were performed on Medline, Pubmed, Cochrane Library, and Embase. Only randomised clinical trials were included. There were no restrictions on the language of publication. The data were extracted in a standardised, predefined manner and assessed critically.  RESULTS—Seventeen randomised clinical trials were found, six of which concerned the use of traditional Chinese herbal medicine and eight described traditional Indian medicine, of which five investigated Tylophora indica. Three other randomised trials tested a Japanese Kampo medicine, marihuana, and dried ivy leaf extract. Nine of the 17 trials reported a clinically relevant improvement in lung function and/or symptom scores.  CONCLUSIONS—No definitive evidence for any of the <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> emerged. Considering the popularity of herbal medicine with asthma patients, there is urgent need for stringently designed clinically relevant randomised clinical trials for <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> in the treatment of asthma. ...|$|R

40|$|The use and {{availability}} of <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> covered by food law is increasing in the Netherlands and in other European Member States. Correspondingly, safety concerns relating to <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> are growing as well. The aim of the present PhD project was therefore to review the toxicity of selected <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations,</b> to investigate the presence and actual levels of selected naturally-occurring toxic substances and contaminants in <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> on the Dutch market and to estimate the associated risks. First, an overview is provided of the Dutch and European legal provisions for food commodities with botanical ingredients, the nature and mechanism of action of various toxic botanical ingredients specifically covered by these provisions, and the health concerns defined by risk assessors related to several botanicals for which no specific legal provisions exist. Secondly, data are presented on the actual occurrence in traditional <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> (THPs) {{of a group of}} phytotoxins, i. e. aristolochic acids, which were banned by the Dutch Commodities Act Decree ‘Herbal preparations’. Aristolochic acids and derivatives are nephrotoxic, genotoxic and carcinogenic and are present in several plants from the Aristolochiaceae family. Aristolochic acids were found in 25 of 190 THPs used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) sampled on the Dutch market. This shows that testing for aristolochic acids of Chinese THPs at risk of contamination is essential in the framework of food safety. Thirdly, the presence of selected toxic contaminants in <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> on the Dutch market was investigated. Lead, mercury and arsenic levels were analyzed in THPs used in several Asian traditional medicine systems, such as Ayurveda, TCM, and Traditional Tibetan Medicine (TTM). These metals and metalloids were present in 186 (64 %) of 292 THPs and use at recommended dose levels of 59 THPs (20 %) would result in intakes of these contaminants significantly above established toxicological safety limits. It was concluded that the mercury, arsenic and lead contents of these Asian THPs are cause for concern. Because metals such as mercury can exist in various defined chemical species with different toxic properties, a study was performed using selective acid extraction procedures to determine {{the presence or absence of}} the relatively non-toxic elemental form of mercury in 19 Ayurvedic THPs, which were shown in the previous study to result in mercury intakes above the safety limit for inorganic mercury when used at the recommended daily dose level. It was concluded that in these THPs the main part of the mercury content is not present in the elemental form, that the mercury detected in Ayurvedic THPs is likely to be present in the inorganic form and that therefore the estimation of the related risks based on the safety limits for inorganic mercury is justified. In the last study of this PhD thesis, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were determined in more than 1500 food supplements sampled on the Dutch market, many of which contained <b>herbal</b> ingredients. <b>Herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> can become contaminated with PAH through various processes including direct atmospheric deposition on plant surfaces and drying practices during manufacturing. Several PAH, such as benzo[a]pyrene are genotoxic and carcinogenic. Supplements containing herbal ingredients such as St. John’s wort and Ginkgo biloba, the phytochemical resveratrol and the bee product propolis showed the highest mean PAH levels. It was shown that individual food supplements can contribute significantly to PAH exposure, whereas on average PAH intake resulting from food supplement use will be at the lower end of the range of contributions of main food groups to PAH exposure. From the work described in this thesis it can be concluded that for <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> ‘natural’ does not equal ‘safe’. Given that uncertainty exists whether additional European legal measures will be taken in the near future to restrict or prohibit the use of specific toxic herbal substances in foods and the fact that several <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations</b> for which specific provisions are absent in Dutch food safety law raise toxicological concern, would suggest that it is prudent to keep the Dutch Decree ‘Herbal preparations’ and other national legislation up to date in order to protect consumers from serious risks resulting from use of botanicals in food products such as <b>herbal</b> <b>preparations...</b>|$|R
