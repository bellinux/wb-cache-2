25|$|A {{photograph}} was taken of Richmond captain-coach Dyer, aged 30 and playing his {{two hundred and}} twenty second game, wearing white strapping on his left thumb, and a dirty knee bandage on his left knee, breaking away from the pack, with his <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the Lake end goals (Dyer went on to kick a goal), {{in the last quarter}} of the 1944 Preliminary Final, held at the Junction Oval, on Saturday 23 September 1944, in which Richmond defeated Essendon, primarily due to Dyer's nine goals.|$|E

25|$|The {{painting}} {{is divided into}} three principal spaces. Musicians occupy the lower left section, one of whom is centrally located, his back turned toward the viewer, with his double-bass erected to the left. A row of dancers, two women and two men with their legs raised, occupy the upper right. They are characterized by curves and rhythmic repetition, creating a synthetic sense of dynamical movement. The background consists of ornate cabaret-style lighting fixtures, and a few members of the audience sitting in the front row, their <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the performance. On the lower right another client is staring with a sidelong glance, indicative of sexual desire or sly and malicious intent; the archetype of a male voyeur, often portrayed in mid-century journalistic illustrations of the can-can.|$|E
500|$|Bond next {{created the}} role of Mad Margaret in Ruddigore (1887; {{originally}} spelt [...] "Ruddygore"), which she regarded as her favourite of all the Gilbert and Sullivan roles, [...] "for it gave me the chance to show what I really could do as an actress." [...] The part was her largest to date, and Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte made her audition it {{for them to be}} sure that she could handle the responsibility. [...] "It was an awful ordeal. [...] I saw the three white faces looming out of the darkness as they sat close together; criticizing me, talking me over, with cold managerial detachment. It nearly killed me. [...] Perhaps it gave an added realism and abandon to my simulated madness, for indeed I was nearly mad with fear – but at any rate I came through triumphantly, they were all three of them delighted." [...] Bond was particularly nervous on opening night. [...] "I shook and tottered so much that Mad Margaret's staff was no mere adjunct, but an absolute necessity. Without it I should have fallen as I stood in the wings waiting to go on. Then some one gave me a push; I was there, on the stage, in the glare of the footlights, hundreds of <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> me, tier upon tier of dim white faces rising from floor to ceiling in the gloom. It was enough; I forgot myself, I was Mad Margaret and no one else. I made an immense success." [...] Cellier and Bridgeman seconded this assessment: ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 April 1801, Nelson began to advance into Copenhagen harbour. The battle began badly for the British, with , [...] and [...] running aground, {{and the rest of}} the fleet encountering heavier fire from the Danish shore {{batteries}} than had been anticipated. Parker sent the signal for Nelson to withdraw, reasoning:I will make the signal for recall for Nelson's sake. If he is in a condition to continue the action he will disregard it; if he is not, it will be an excuse for his retreat and no blame can be attached to him. Nelson, directing action aboard , was informed of the signal by the signal lieutenant, Frederick Langford, but angrily responded: [...] "I told you to look out on the Danish commodore and let me know when he surrendered. Keep your <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> him." [...] He then turned to his flag captain, Thomas Foley, and said [...] "You know, Foley, I have only one eye. I have a right to be blind sometimes." [...] He raised the telescope to his blind eye, and said [...] "I really do not see the signal." [...] The battle lasted three hours, leaving both Danish and British fleets heavily damaged. At length Nelson dispatched a letter to the Danish commander, Crown Prince Frederick, calling for a truce, which the Prince accepted. Parker approved of Nelson's actions in retrospect, and Nelson was given the honour of going into Copenhagen the next day to open formal negotiations. At a banquet that evening, he told Prince Frederick that the battle had been the most severe he had ever been in. The outcome of the battle and several weeks of ensuing negotiations was a 14-week armistice, and on Parker's recall in May, Nelson became commander-in-chief in the Baltic Sea. As a reward for the victory, he was created Viscount Nelson of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk, on 19 May 1801. In addition, on 4 August 1801, he was created Baron Nelson, of the Nile and of Hilborough in the County of Norfolk, this time with a special remainder to his father and sisters. Nelson had sailed to the Russian naval base at Reval (now Tallinn) in May, and there learned that the pact of armed neutrality was to be disbanded. Satisfied with the outcome of the expedition, he returned to England, arriving on 1 July.|$|E

2500|$|Recitative and prologue. Hamlet asks Ophélie if he may sit at {{her feet}} (Hamlet: Belle, permettez-nous [...] "Lady, permit me"). She {{responds}} that his expression frightens and chills her. Hamlet sits, his <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the King and Queen. Everyone takes their places, and the curtains of the small theatre are opened. The play is introduced with a short orchestral passage featuring a saxophone solo. (According to Annegret Fauser {{this is the first}} instance of the use of a saxophone in an opera.) In an aside Hamlet asks Marcellus to watch the King (Hamlet: Voici l'instant! fixez vos regards sur le Roi, et, si vous le voyez pâlir, dites-le moi! [...] "Now! Fix your gaze on upon the King, and, if he should turn pale, tell me!").|$|E
2500|$|That {{suspension}} {{is created}} [...] "simply, by denying the listener any I chords," [...] Pallett explains. After {{the first few}} lines, the B tonic chord that repeats throughout the song is offset by bass notes that give it a more dominant 7th feel. [...] "The I chord will never appear again," [...] he observes. At the same time, however, Perry begins singing the melody on that note, and returns to it frequently, even when it clashes with the dominant V chord as she sings [...] "feel like I'm living a". [...] "he vocal melody establishes the key so clearly {{that there is no}} doubt ... Her voice is the sun and the song is in orbit around it," [...] he concludes. [...] "The insistence of the tonic in the melody keeps your ears’ <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the destination, but the song never arrives there. Weightlessness is achieved. Great work, songwriters!" [...] Pallett notes other classic pop songs, such as Fleetwood Mac's [...] "Dreams" [...] and Coldplay's [...] "Viva La Vida", that employ the same device.|$|E

2500|$|Phillimore and the Edgar {{went with}} Sir Hyde Parker's fleet for his {{expedition}} to the Baltic in 1801. [...] During the Battle of Copenhagen Phillimore {{had been sent to}} Parker's flagship, the 90-gun [...] to take his examination. He served as the Londons acting-signal lieutenant during the battle, sending Parker's famous signal for Nelson to withdraw. Nelson, directing action aboard , was informed of the signal by the signal lieutenant, Frederick Langford, but angrily responded: 'I told you to look out on the Danish commodore and let me know when he surrendered. Keep your <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> him.' He then turned to his flag captain, Thomas Foley, and said 'You know, Foley, I have only one eye. I {{have a right to be}} blind sometimes.' He raised the telescope to his blind eye, and said 'I really do not see the signal.' [...] Phillimore returned to the Edgar after the battle, where he learnt that the Edgars first lieutenant had been killed in the engagement. A round of general promotions of the junior officers followed, and Phillimore was promoted to lieutenant.|$|E
2500|$|Notorious for {{his defense}} against the pirates, Mangkaw was a known net-fisherman. Already a fishing ground that it is today, Sogod then had houses {{clustered}} close to shore around the watchtower. Being {{an expert in the}} art of casting the net, Laya, he could send out the casting net in a perfect circle in the sea. As the community grew bigger, the residents agitated for a name for their place. Meetings after meetings were held presided by Mangkaw. But every time a meeting is ongoing, a shoal of fish would be seen by the subtle wave of the surface or quick shifting shadow beneath the surface. The eyes of the pondering datu kept stalking it, interfering with the meeting. Satisfying his unequalled fisherman's instinct, he would leave the meeting unattended and his body language was being watched by the attendees, feasting their eyes on the artful slide of the feet of the datu so as not to disturb the surface, his <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the school. Then, he shared his catch with the people for the asking, even by strangers. After which, shouts of [...] "Sogod, sogod!" [...] (vernacular for [...] "to begin") would reconvene the meeting. Thus the word [...] "Sogod" [...] became the name of the village then and the town as it is today.|$|E
