5|$|For {{the next}} several months, Davis' unit {{undertook}} patrol and escort missions in the Cape Gloucester area and around the islands of Saidor, Manus, and Momote. Through May, these actions were relatively uneventful, except for one <b>fighter</b> <b>sweep</b> mission from Wewak. Davis flew 69 missions from May to August, including several dive-bombing attacks on Japanese positions on Hansa Bay. Davis then flew another 40 missions from September to November, including six patrols between Wakde Island and Hollandia. On November 14, Davis was promoted to the temporary rank of captain.|$|E
5|$|Galland {{received}} {{a telephone call}} from Göring on 10 May 1941, requesting Galland to intercept a Messerschmitt Bf 110 flown by Rudolf Hess heading for Scotland. Galland was unable to launch a full <b>fighter</b> <b>sweep.</b> However, Hess' flight was far to the north and he reached Scotland crashing his aircraft. Galland sent out fighters to conduct some sweeps so he could honestly claim to have carried out his orders but it was nearly dark and Galland ordered his pilots unused to night flying to stand down.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at 09:35, two USAF F-15C fighter {{aircraft}} {{from the}} 53d Fighter Squadron, piloted by Captain Eric Wickson and Lieutenant Colonel Randy W. May, departed Incirlik AB. Their {{mission was to}} perform an initial <b>fighter</b> <b>sweep</b> of the TAOR to clear the area of any hostile aircraft prior to the entry of coalition forces. The air tasking order (ATO) {{that was supposed to}} list all scheduled coalition aircraft missions for that day and which the two pilots reviewed before takeoff, mentioned that U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters would be operating in the TAOR that day but did not list takeoff times, routes, or flight durations for them. At 10:15, Wickson radioed Martin on the AWACS and asked if he had any information to pass to them to which Martin replied in the negative.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{set about}} {{changing}} the wing's tactical approach. He quickly forced the wing to abandon the line-astern tactics for the finger-four formation which offered much more safety in combat; enabling multiple pilots to participate in scanning the skies for enemy aircraft {{so as to avoid}} an attack, and also being better able to spot and position their unit for a surprise attack upon the enemy. Johnson made another alteration to his units operations. He loathed ground-attack missions which highly trained fighter pilots were forced to participate in. He abandoned ground attack missions whenever he could. During these weeks, Johnson's wing escorted United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bombers to targets in France. On a <b>fighter</b> <b>sweep,</b> Ramrod 49, Johnson destroyed an Fw 190 for his eighth victory. Unteroffizier Hans Hiess from 6 Staffel bailed out, but his parachute failed to open.|$|E
5|$|On 22November 1941, during Operation Crusader, Rawlinson led No.3 Squadron on a bomber escort mission near Bir el Gubi in the morning, and a <b>fighter</b> <b>sweep</b> {{south-east}} of El Adem in the afternoon. German Messerschmitt Bf109 fighters {{shot down}} three Tomahawks {{for the loss}} of two of their own in the first action, Rawlinson claiming a 109 damaged. In the second action, a drawn-out battle for air superiority, the squadron lost six Tomahawks against two 109s destroyed, one of which was claimed by Rawlinson along with one probable and one damaged. He had also taken a shot at a distant 109 and, believing he had missed it, did not claim. After the war it was established that Rawlinson's bullets had damaged the 109 and wounded its pilot, Ernst Düllberg, who made a forced landing back at base. Rawlinson was credited with his final victory on 30November, when he downed an Italian Macchi C.200 in an engagement that saw No.3 Squadron's tally of claims rise to 106 aircraft destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} go-ahead {{was given}} at 14:00. At 15:30, some 58–80 Ju 88s from I., II., and III./LG 1, escorted by 30 Bf 110s of V./LG 1, took off to bomb Boscombe Down and Worthy Down. RAF Andover {{was to be}} bombed as well, {{with the support of}} 52 Ju 87s from StG 1 and StG 2 who were to strike at RAF Warmwell and Yeovil. I./JG 53 flew a <b>fighter</b> <b>sweep</b> ahead of the bombers from Poole to Lyme Regis in order to tempt the RAF into battle. I./JG 53 made landfall at 16:00. The sweep failed to attract and divert RAF squadrons. Instead, all it succeeded in doing was to alert the RAF defences a critical five minutes earlier. When the main wave of LG 1 and StG 2 arrived over the coast, they were greeted by 77 RAF fighters.|$|E
50|$|From April 1942, 16 Squadron was re-equipped {{with the}} Allison-engined North American Mustang I for <b>fighter</b> <b>sweeps</b> and {{reconnaissance}} duties over France from its base at RAF Weston Zoyland in Somerset.|$|R

5|$|A new convoy, codenamed Operation Excess {{was on its}} {{way through}} Malta with {{ammunition}} supplies. Excess coincided {{with the arrival of the}} Luftwaffe Fliegerkorps X (10th Air Corps) in Sicily to support the faltering Italians in the theatre, after the failed invasion of Egypt. On 9 January the Regia Aeronautica flew a <b>fighter</b> <b>sweep</b> over the Grand Harbour. Eighteen Macchi C.200s from 6° Gruppo were engaged in aerial combat. MacLachlan climbed to 22,000 feet and spotted the enemy fighters 10,000 below. He attacked a group of six and shot one down into the sea where it left a large plume of water. MacLachlan circled the sea and noticed the Italian pilot had escaped his aircraft and survived. Capitano Luigi Armanino was taken aboard a rescue craft to a prisoner of war camp in Malta, wounded in the thigh and arm. MacLachlan claimed a second Macchi shot down minutes later. The following day he attacked an Italian Fiat CR.42 over the Excess convoy as the Italians attacked the ships once more. Four others appeared and they climbed over him and dropped onto his tail. Not risking a five to one encounter, MacLachlan flew over the Excess convoy hoping the ship's fire would protect him The British vessels fired at him in error but his aircraft was not hit.|$|E
5|$|Airfields, harbors and {{shipping}} {{were also the}} targets on October 12, this time in northern Formosa. These {{would be the first}} strikes Fighting 18 executed in the face of both significant anti-aircraft fire and airborne interception by enemy planes. The first <b>fighter</b> <b>sweep</b> of the day launched into overcast skies at 06:17 and headed for Shinchiku Airfield with VF-18 flying low cover. Unfortunately, the Japanese were alerted to the formation's presence ahead of time, and the morning's protective cloud cover dissipated above Shinchiku. Flak of all calibers was intense as a result. Harris and the other Intrepid fighters led the way in, pushing over in glide bombing attacks on hangars around the strip. After the bombs dropped, the fighters headed north for their next target, Matsuyama Airfield. On the way to Matsuyama the cloud cover thickened once more. Just shy of Taien Airfield, VF-18 pilots spotted six Japanese bombers working their way down through a layer of clouds, seemingly on a landing approach. Intrepids fighters caught and destroyed the whole bomber formation in two minutes. Harris was credited with shooting down two of them.|$|E
5|$|Erprobungsgruppe 210 {{were sent}} further east for an {{operation}} to attack targets near Southend. They took off at 15:15 and were escorted by ZG 76. Unfortunately, they found unbroken cloud over Essex. No. 56 Squadron RAF intercepted, but Erprobungsgruppe 210 dropped their bombs over Canterbury. II./StG 1 {{was sent to}} bomb airfields near Rochester. It failed to find the target and returned without incident. IV./LG 1—also with Ju 87s—was sent after RAF Detling. JG 26 went out on a <b>fighter</b> <b>sweep</b> to clear the skies {{in advance of the}} attack. JG 26 lost one Bf 109 over Folkestone from an unknown cause. The Ju 87s bombed the station and 40 Bf 109s strafed it, killing the commander. The operations block was hit, causing high casualties. The losses were disastrous for No. 53 Squadron RAF, which lost a number of Blenheims on the ground. The commander killed was Group Captain E P Meggs-Davis. One Squadron Leader was killed—a J.H Lowe—and a further two were wounded. One of the wounded men was a First World War ace Robert J. O. Compston. The station's casualties amounted to 24 killed and 42 wounded. However, Detling was not an RAF Fighter Command station and the attack did not affect No. 11 Group RAF in any way.|$|E
50|$|From England, the {{squadron}} scorted heavy bombers during operations against targets on the Continent, strafed targets of opportunity, and flew fighter-bomber, counter-air, and area-patrol missions. Engaged primarily in B-17/B-24 escort activities and <b>fighter</b> <b>sweeps</b> until the Normandy invasion in June 1944.|$|R
50|$|Moved to the Philippines in Nov, flew <b>fighter</b> <b>sweeps</b> against enemy airfields, {{supported}} U.S. ground forces, {{and protected}} sea convoys and transport routes. Beginning in July 1945, attacked railways, airfields, and enemy installations in Korea and Kyushu, Japan from Okinawa.|$|R
50|$|The 479th FG escorted heavy bombers during {{operations}} against targets on the continent, strafed targets of opportunity, and flew fighter-bomber, area and counter-air patrol missions.

5|$|In March 1942 the {{squadron}} moved to RAF Redhill, Surrey where it assumed No. 452 Squadron's front line duties {{as part of}} No. 11 Group RAF. These included shipping protection patrols, escorting bombers, conducting fighter sweeps over northern France and contributing to the air defence of southern England. Fighter Command had received authorisation to launch a full-scale offensive campaign against German air units shortly before No.457 Squadron arrived at Redhill, and it became part of this effort. The squadron first saw action on 26March when Brothers shot down a Bf109 during a multi-squadron <b>fighter</b> <b>sweep</b> over France, though one of its Spitfires was lost in this action. By {{the end of its}} first week of operations No.457 Squadron had shot down three German aircraft and inflicted damage on several others and it went on to conduct 32 operations over German territory by 26April. These operations often encountered fierce opposition, and German Fw190 fighters proved superior to the Spitfire Mark Vs that No.457 Squadron was equipped with. The squadron scored its last victory over Europe on 29April, though fighter sweeps over France continued until almost the end of May.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days after}} the October meeting, JG50 was disbanded and its {{personnel}} absorbed into I./Jagdgeschwader 301, a Wilde Sau night-fighter unit. While operational, JG 50 had claimed 45 Allied four-engined bombers. Graf was promoted to Oberst (Colonel) and on 11 November, appointed Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of JG11, when Mader was transferred to JG54 in the Leningrad sector. Aside from Grislawski, who was kept on as Staka (the squadron commander) of 1./ JG1, he managed to take his soccer players and friends with him. Sunday 20 February marked the start of ”Big Week” – six consecutive days of concentrated bombing by the USAAF designed to overwhelm the German defences. JG11 was heavily involved and Graf shot down a B-24 Liberator for his 208th victory on the 24 February. His 209th aerial victory, west of Berlin on 6 March, was over another B-24 Liberator, of the 453d Bombardment Group. It was actually an Herausschuss (separation shot) – a severely damaged heavy bomber forced to separate from its combat box and which the Luftwaffe counted as an aerial victory. On 29 March, Graf shot down two P-51 Mustangs that were making a <b>fighter</b> <b>sweep</b> ahead of their bomber stream. Chased and harried {{by the rest of}} their squadron, he tried to ram another before bailing out. Landing heavily, he broke both knees and fractured his arm. These would prove to be his final air victories. Prompt attention from the JG11 medic saved Graf from losing his arm. From April to early July he spent time recovering in a hospital in his home-town of Engen. On June 24, he married Jobst, whom he had been seeing over the past year.|$|E
25|$|On 9 May, the {{squadron}} flew its first combat mission, a <b>fighter</b> <b>sweep</b> over Alençon. For the remainer of the month, the unit flew fighter sweeps, bomber escort and dive bombing, missions and suffered its first combat losses.|$|E
50|$|As events turned out, {{the only}} F.R. unit {{equipped}} with F.R. Mk. XIVs was No. 403 Squadron RCAF and although its primary role was tactical reconnaissance, the unit also engaged in <b>fighter</b> <b>sweeps</b> resulting in successful encounters with Luftwaffe aircraft, including {{the destruction of}} an Me 262.|$|R

50|$|No. 54 Squadron {{returned}} to Hornchurch in February 1941, flying <b>fighter</b> <b>sweeps</b> and bomber escort missions over Northern France until November 1941, when it moved north to RAF Castletown, Caithness, undertaking coastal patrols over the Pentland Firth. In June 1942, the squadron {{was moved to}} RAF Wellingore, to prepare for moving to Australia.|$|R
25|$|The group {{earned a}} Distinguished Unit Citation when it engaged and {{destroyed}} Japanese interceptor aircraft during a long-range <b>fighter</b> <b>sweep</b> to Korea on 13 August 1945. After the Japanese surrender, the 507th moved to Yontan Airfield, Okinawa in January 1946, and was inactivated there on 27 May 1946.|$|E
25|$|The group began {{operations}} {{by making}} a <b>fighter</b> <b>sweep</b> over France on 1 May. It engaged primarily in escort and dive-bombing missions for the next month.

25|$|The first P-47 combat mission {{took place}} 10 March 1943 when the 4th FG took their {{aircraft}} on a <b>fighter</b> <b>sweep</b> over France. The mission {{was a failure}} due to radio malfunctions. All P-47s were refitted with British radios, and missions resumed 8 April. The first P-47 air combat took place 15 April with Major Don Blakeslee of the 4th FG scoring the Thunderbolt's first air victory (against a Focke-Wulf Fw 190).|$|E
25|$|The 355th FG flew {{its first}} combat mission, a <b>fighter</b> <b>sweep</b> over Belgium, on 14 September 1943 and {{afterwards}} served primarily as escort for Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress/Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers that attacked industrial areas of Berlin, marshalling yards at Karlsruhe, an airfield at Neuberg, oil refineries at Misburg, synthetic oil plants at Gelsenkirchen, locks at Minden, and other objectives. The group also flew fighter sweeps, area patrols, and bombing missions, striking such targets as air parks, locomotives, bridges, radio stations, and armoured cars.|$|E
25|$|Early on September 14, a <b>fighter</b> <b>sweep</b> {{was made}} against Aparri, Luzon, {{following}} which she steamed {{to the east}} of Luzon to neutralize installations to the east prior to invasion landings on Leyte. On the 15th, Franklin was attacked by three enemy planes, one of which scored with a bomb that hit the after outboard corner of the deck edge elevator, killing three men and wounding 22. The carrier's aircraft hit Manila Bay on 19 October when her planes sank and damaged ships and boats, destroyed a floating drydock, and claimed 11 Japanese aircraft.|$|E
50|$|On 21 April, Bataan {{launched}} five <b>fighter</b> <b>sweeps</b> {{to attack}} Japanese aircraft and ground installations on New Guinea.
