40|$|The {{replacement}} of the ATR Control Complex's obsolete computer based Reactor Data Acquisition System (RDAS) and its safety-related Lobe Power Calculation and Indication System (LPCIS) software application is vitally important to ensure the ATR remains available to support this national mission. The RDAS supports safe operation of the reactor by providing 'real-time' plant status information (<b>indications</b> <b>and</b> <b>alarms)</b> {{for use by the}} reactor operators via the Console Display System (CDS). The RDAS is a computer support system that acquires analog and digital information from various reactor and reactor support systems. The RDAS information is used to display quadrant and lobe powers via a display interface more user friendly than that provided by the recorders and the Control Room upright panels. RDAS provides input to the Nuclear Engineering ATR Surveillance Data System (ASUDAS) for fuel burn-up analysis and the production of cycle data for experiment sponsors and the generation of the Core Safety Assurance Package (CSAP). RDAS also archives and provides for retrieval of historical plant data which may be used for event reconstruction, data analysis, training and safety analysis. The RDAS, LPCIS and ASUDAS need to be replaced with state-of-the-art technology in order to eliminate problems of aged computer systems, and difficulty in obtaining software upgrades, spare parts, and technical support. The major modification criteria evaluation of the project design did not lead {{to the conclusion that the}} project is a major modification. The negative major modification determination is driven by the fact that the project requires a one-for-one equivalent {{replacement of}} existing systems that protects and maintains functional and operational requirements as credited in the safety basis...|$|E

We can overcome the manual operation by fully Automation, microcontroller is used to operate the machine in individual drive operation mode and Automatic operation mode.

40|$|The Respond and Pump in Days (RAPID) {{project was}} {{initiated}} to pump {{part of the}} contents of tank 241 -SY- 101 into tank 241 -SY- 102. This document establishes the basis for all set points and ranges used in the RAPID project. There are 23 instrument and/or control loops utilized by the RAPID project. These range from the simple indication loop with two components to complex <b>indication,</b> control, <b>and</b> <b>alarm</b> loops with up to eight components. Several loops include safety class elements. This document is intended to describe the loops in full and to provide the basis for each of the element setpoints, ranges and accuracies identified in the RAPID project Master Equipment List (MEL). These values are developed in two steps. First, the base value is identified with reference to the supporting document providing that value. Second, a spreadsheet calculation is performed on each element and loop, utilizing a standard methodology described below, that takes into account known and suspected variance in output and establishes the actual setpoint used on a given element. The results of the spreadsheet are reported directly in this document...|$|R

40|$|According to {{the field}} {{investigation}} data, a meteorological forecast <b>and</b> <b>alarm</b> model of geologic disasters in Hefei Area has been established. This model was based on GIS raster data model {{in order to be}} integrated with GIS Digital Terrain Model (DTM) Component Object Model (COM). Some important factors that put premium on geological hazards, such as intraday and five-day forecasting and liminal precipitation, subareas of geologic disasters, have been considered in the model. The model has been integrated with forecast <b>and</b> <b>alarm</b> information system based on GIS seamlessly by the way of using ComGIS. The meteorological forecast <b>and</b> <b>alarm</b> information system of geologic disaster can be used to publish the forecasting <b>and</b> <b>alarming</b> information of geologic disaster according to the intraday and five-day forecasting precipitation from day to day in rainy seasons every year in Hefei Area. The successful establishment of the meteorological forecast <b>and</b> <b>alarm</b> information system of geologic disasters in Hefei Area demonstrated that this integrating method is feasible and it has the value of practicality and popularization in a certain degree. 1. 1 Instructions of Research 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{specific}} requirements {{that appear in}} addressable fire detection <b>and</b> <b>alarm</b> systems <b>and</b> the shortcomings of the existing addressing methods were discussed. A new method of addressing of detectors was proposed. The basic principles of addressing and responding of a called element are stated. Extinguishing module is specific subsystem in classic fire detection <b>and</b> <b>alarm</b> systems. Appearing of addressable fire detection <b>and</b> <b>alarm</b> systems didn't caused essential change {{in the concept of}} extinguishing module because of long calling period of such systems. Addressable fire security system based on counting addressing method reaches high calling rates and enables integrating of the extinguishing module in addressable system. Solutions for command addressable element and integrated extinguishing module are given in this paper. The counting addressing method was developed for {{specific requirements}} in fire detection <b>and</b> <b>alarm</b> systems, yet its speed and reliability justifies its use in the acquisition of data on slowly variable parameters under industrial conditions. ...|$|R
