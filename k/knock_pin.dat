If the ball {{stays on the}} canal but doesn't hit any pins, a gain-huts (top zero) is declared, if the middle one is left standing an erdikuts (middle zero) is declared. The maximum one can make is three per throw, either by <b>knocking</b> the <b>pins</b> over with the ball or by a <b>pin</b> <b>knocking</b> another <b>pin.</b> <b>Pins</b> <b>knocked</b> over by a ball rebounding from the sides do not count.|$|R

50|$|In all six variations, {{games last}} for 10 frames, or turns. At {{the start of}} each frame, the current player is given two chances to roll a bowling ball down an alley in an attempt to knock down as many of the ten bowling pins as possible. The bowler (on {{the left side of the}} screen) may move up and down his end of the alley to aim before {{releasing}} the ball. In four of the game's six variations, the ball can be steered before it hits the <b>pins.</b> <b>Knocking</b> down every <b>pin</b> on the first shot is a strike, while <b>knocking</b> every <b>pin</b> down in both shots is a spare. The player's score is determined by the number of <b>pins</b> <b>knocked</b> down in all 10 frames, as well as the number of strikes and spares acquired.|$|R
50|$|The goal of {{the game}} is to earn a {{required}} number of points, before one's opponent does, by using one's cue ball to cause the opponent's cue ball to <b>knock</b> over <b>pins</b> (and to not do so with one's own cue ball), and by contacting the red object ball with either cue ball, after one's own cue ball has contacted that of the opponent, and/or by causing the object ball to <b>knock</b> over <b>pins,</b> again after one's own cue ball has contacted that of the opponent.|$|R

25|$|In tournaments within {{countries}} like Taiwan where they use house conditions, spinning {{can be an}} advantage over rolling. However, when tournaments use the more conventional oil patterns, where the oil is laid from the foul line to about 40 feet, and is dry up to the pin rack, spinning loses its advantage since friction exists. Carry is also a more reliable and consistent technique of <b>knocking</b> <b>pins</b> down on the first ball, as spinning is less predictable in terms of pin deflection, and at times can result in odd leaves - including the 5-pin and wash-outs when missing the 1-pin.|$|R
50|$|If a bowler’s roll {{does not}} result in either “9” or “12” points, that bowler’s roll is given a “-“ (dash) or a “√” (check) which carries no point value.The one {{exception}} to {{this is the last}} ball rolled by the last bowler in the frame. This bowler will receive credit for the number of <b>pins</b> <b>knocked</b> down. For example, if the last bowler has rolled his second ball for this frame, and three pins remain standing (six <b>pins</b> <b>knocked</b> down), that bowler will receive credit for those six pins, regardless if that bowler <b>knocked</b> these six <b>pins</b> down or not.|$|R

50|$|To score, {{a player}} has {{to launch a}} ball onto the {{launching}} platform down either channel.

50|$|The player, using spin, {{launches}} {{the ball}} onto either {{the left or}} right long incline and to achieve a valid throw, has to knock over at least the small pin and one large pin.

5000|$|The players use {{a wooden}} pin (also called [...] "mölkky") {{to try to}} <b>knock</b> over wooden <b>pins</b> (also called [...] "skittles") of almost similar {{dimensions}} with the throwing pin, which are marked with numbers from 1 to 12. The pins are initially placed in a tight group in an upright position 3-4 metres away from the throwing place, with the pins organized as follows: 1st row, 1/2; 2nd row, 3/10/4; 3rd row, 5/11/12/6; 4th row, 7/9/8. <b>Knocking</b> over one <b>pin</b> scores the amount of points marked on the <b>pin.</b> <b>Knocking</b> 2 or more pins scores the number of <b>pins</b> <b>knocked</b> over (e.g., <b>knocking</b> over 3 <b>pins</b> scores 3 points). A pin does not count if it is leaning on the mölkky {{or one of the}} numbered pins (it must be parallel to the ground to count). After each throw, the pins are stood up again in the exact location where they landed. The first one to reach exactly 50 points wins the game. Scoring more than 50 will be penalised by setting the player's score back to 25 points. A player will be eliminated from the game if they miss all of the target pins three times in a row.|$|R
