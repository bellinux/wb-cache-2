In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the power to revoke television licences, purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power to revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E

5|$|A major {{branch of}} {{numerical}} analysis {{is devoted to}} the development of efficient algorithms for matrix computations, a subject that is centuries old and is today an expanding area of research. Matrix decomposition methods simplify computations, both theoretically and practically. Algorithms that are tailored to particular matrix structures, such as sparse matrices and near-diagonal matrices, expedite computations in finite element method and other computations. Infinite matrices occur in planetary theory and in atomic theory. A simple <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> infinite matrix is the matrix representing the derivative operator, which acts on the Taylor series of a function.|$|E

Mg2+ ion concentration {{has also been shown}} to affect the stability of FourU. The most well-studied RNA thermometer is found in the rpoH gene in Escherichia coli. This thermosensor upregulates heat shock proteins under high temperatures through σ32, a specialised heat-shock sigma factor.|$|E
