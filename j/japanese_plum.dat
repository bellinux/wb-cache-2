40|$|Postharvest {{life and}} {{susceptibility}} to chilling injury (CI) in <b>Japanese</b> <b>plums</b> (Prunus salicina Lindl.) are {{greatly influenced by}} preharvest and postharvest factors. The phenomenon of postharvest oxidative stress has been implicated in affecting fruit quality, potential storability and susceptibility to development of physiological disorders during storage of fruits. Therefore, the investigations were carried out to understand the role of various factors, such as cultivar, harvest maturity, storage conditions (temperature and atmosphere composition), duration of storage and postharvest treatments, {{in the development of}} oxidative stress in <b>Japanese</b> <b>plums,</b> in relation to fruit quality and CI. The degree of lipid peroxidation and membrane integrity was measured by determining the activity of lipoxygenase enzyme, concentration of thiobarbituric acid–reactive substances, and amount of electrolyte leakage. The activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase, were determined as a direct measure of the enzymatic antioxidant capacity. The activities of enzymes (ascorbate peroxidase, monodehydroascorbate reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione–S–transferase) involved in the oxidation and regeneration of ascorbate (AA) and glutathione (GSH) were also determined to underpin the dynamics of the AA–GSH cycle. The concentrations of AA, dehydroascorbate (DHA), GSH, and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were determined to compute the AA:DHA and GSH:GSSG ratios as the indicators of redox potential of fruit tissue. The total phenolics concentration and total antioxidant capacity were also determined {{as a part of the}} non–enzymatic antioxidants. The experimental data suggest that postharvest oxidative stress developed during fruit ripening in <b>Japanese</b> <b>plums,</b> but the rate was dependent on the climacteric behaviour of fruit. The climacteric cultivars, ‘Blackamber’ and ‘Amber Jewel’, showed a faster decline in the ability of antioxidative system to encounter the oxidative stress during fruit ripening as compared to ‘Angeleno’, a suppressed–climacteric cultivar. The delay in harvesting of ‘Amber Jewel’ plums by one week slightly improved fruit quality and the initial status of antioxidants than the commercial harvest. However, the fruit harvested at commercial maturity had better retention of antioxidative system during cold storage at 0 °C for 3 – 4 weeks compared to the fruit from the delayed harvest. The changes in enzymatic and non–enzymatic antioxidants as a function of storage duration appear to be more prominent in providing protection against oxidative injury expressed as CI than their at–harvest status. The response of the antioxidative system in ‘Amber Jewel’ plums at 5 °C was significantly better than at 0 °C. But, the storage temperature of 5 °C was not sufficiently low to inhibit the process of fruit ripening, resulting in limited storage life of 2 weeks. The multiple–point time course analysis of lipid peroxidation and changes in enzymatic and non–enzymatic antioxidants of ‘Blackamber’ plums revealed that the third week of storage is the critical point beyond which the capacity of antioxidative system to cope with the increasing oxidative stress from CI and fruit ripening began to decline, resulting in increased incidence and severity of CI during the extended periods of storage. Controlled atmospheres (CA) were found beneficial to reduce the levels of oxidative stress in ‘Blackamber’ plums. CA containing 1 % O[subscript] 2 + 3 % CO[subscript] 2 were effective in mitigating the oxidative stress during the 5 weeks of cold storage at 0 – 1 °C, plus 6 days of shelf life at 21 ± 1 °C. The efficacy of CA (1 % or 2. 5 % O[subscript] 2 + 3 % CO[subscript] 2) in alleviating CI in ‘Blackamber’ plums could be further enhanced by the pre–storage treatment of fruit with 1 –methylcyclopropene (1 –MCP, 0. 6 μL L[superscript]–[superscript] 1). The combination of CA and 1 –MCP exhibited synergistic effects on the alleviation of oxidative stress, resulting in enhanced storage life up to 8 weeks, plus 6 days of shelf–life. The role of nitric oxide (NO) as an antioxidant was also investigated in order to retard fruit ripening, delay the onset of senescence and development of oxidative stress in the <b>Japanese</b> <b>plums.</b> Postharvest NO fumigation (10 or 20 μL L[superscript]–[superscript] 1) delayed the fruit ripening and maintained quality for 9 – 12 days in ‘Amber Jewel’ and ‘Blackamber’ plums at 21 ± 1 °C. NO fumigation was also beneficial to reduce the symptoms of CI during cold storage of ‘Amber Jewel’ and ‘Blackamber’ plums for 5 – 6 weeks at 0 °C, plus 5 days of shelf–life at 21 ± 1 °C. The positive effects of NO fumigation on the enzymatic and non–enzymatic antioxidants in addition to reduced rates of lipid peroxidation were associated with the enhanced chilling tolerance in <b>Japanese</b> <b>plums.</b> The response of ‘Amber Jewel’ to postharvest NO fumigation was significantly better than ‘Blackamber’. In conclusion, the development of oxidative stress in <b>Japanese</b> <b>plums</b> was influenced by cultivar, harvest maturity, cold storage (temperature, duration and atmosphere composition), and postharvest treatments with NO and 1 –MCP. The mitigation of oxidative stress by manipulation of postharvest storage conditions and treatments can be achieved to maintain fruit quality and reduce the incidence and severity of CI in <b>Japanese</b> <b>plums...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cold storage-induced {{oxidative}} stress {{in relation to}} harvest maturity and storage duration together with its implications on fruit quality and storage potential of <b>Japanese</b> <b>plums</b> (Prunus salicina Lindl.) were investigated. ‘Amber Jewel’ plums harvested at commercial maturity and one week after commercial maturity (delayed harvest) were stored at 0 °C for 7 weeks. Oxidative stress related parameters were determined at weekly intervals. Similar to lipid peroxidation, the incidence and severity of chilling injury (CI) was higher in fruit from the delayed harvest compared to commercial harvest. The activities of primary antioxidant enzymes and ascorbate-glutathione cycle enzymes were determined in context to the levels of antioxidant pools of ascorbate and glutathione {{and the development of}} CI symptoms. The predominance of the oxidized state of the tissue as reflected by lower ratios of ascorbate (AA) to dehydroascorbate (DHA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was linked to the severity of CI symptoms during the last 3 - 4 weeks of storage. The status of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidative system during cold storage of <b>Japanese</b> <b>plums</b> appeared to be more important in providing protection against oxidative injury expressed as CI than at-harvest antioxidant status. Delayed harvested fruit experienced more {{oxidative stress}} during cold storage compared to the fruit harvested at commercial maturity. In conclusion harvesting ‘Amber Jewel’ plums at commercial maturity is of paramount importance to ensure long-term cold storage with minimal adverse effects on fruit quality for better consumer experiences...|$|R
40|$|The {{cell wall}} {{composition}} of <b>Japanese</b> <b>plums</b> (Prunus salicina) at six developmental stages was previously evaluated (Ponce et al., J. Agric. Food Chem. 2010, 58, 2562 – 2570). This fruit {{is an interesting}} source of pectins, polysaccharides of valuable functionality for pharmaceutical and food formulations. In the present work it was investigated how the different conditions for the aqueous extraction of pectins from <b>Japanese</b> <b>plums</b> affect the yield {{as well as their}} chemical and rheological characteristics. It has been determined that extraction with water at room temperature for periods longer than 2 h did not produce additional increment of yield (12 %) but decreased the average molecular weights of the extracted pectins. Pectins with a degree of methylation ≈ 40 % with high viscosity in water and with adequate molecular weights (≈ 72, 000) were obtained. Conversely, utilization of boiling water for extraction increased considerably the yields (33 – 38 %) but the extracted pectins showed significant lower viscosity in water in spite of their higher molecular weights. The poorer thickening ability was associated to the lower proportion of arabinose residues present in the hairy regions of the pectin macromolecules extracted by hot water, which led the polymers to interact more transiently in a 2 % w/v water solution.

50|$|For Cherry X disease {{there are}} two types of hosts for the phytoplasma, {{reservoir}} and non-reservoir hosts. Reservoir hosts can survive for long periods while being infected with the disease. This allows them to be a constant food source for the leafhoppers which act to vector the phytoplasma from these hosts to other hosts in the area. Choke cherry is the most common reservoir host and a favorite food for the cherry leafhoppers. Other reservoir hosts include clovers and dandelions. Sweet/sour cherries, as well as almonds and <b>Japanese</b> <b>plums</b> are all fruit tree reservoir hosts for the Cherry X disease. All of these, once infected, can act as a source for the disease to be vectored from to other hosts. While non-cherry hosts can become infected they are not the preferred host of the phytoplasma. Because of the vectors preference for cherry trees, choke cherry which is a wild growing cherry species is the most common host of the disease. The range that Cherry X disease is distributed over is directly linked to the distribution of wild choke cherry populations.|$|R

Only cultivars with long storage potential are grown {{to accommodate the}} 3 - 4 week shipping time required to reach these markets. Most orchards are grown in regions with inadequate winter chilling, necessitating the use of rest-breaking agents. Strong winds are typically experienced during the fruit growth period, and most orchards are consequently trellised to prevent the formation of rub marks that reduce the fruit value. Most modern plantings are planted at high densities with spacings ~ 4 x 1. 5 m (1667 trees/ha) in hedgerow systems. Sometimes V systems are planted at 4 x 0. 75 m (3333 trees/ha).

40|$|Due to climatic {{conditions}} and cultural traditions, {{only a part}} of the world fruit and vegetable diversity is cultivated in Europe.

Nevertheless for most of the species, the number of cultivars has a tendency to increase in the most important cultigroups and to decrease in minor cultigroups (winter radish, running beans, peas, etc.). The diversity at the genotypic level can be estimated by neutral molecular markers like microsatellites or SNPs. Several situations have been described: (i) a good relationship between genotype and phenotype for instance in cherry tomatoes versus large-fruited types or in peach; (ii) a correlation between genotype and geographical origin; (iii) or a mix of both with foundation effects of a small number of parental accessions.

Following treatment, fruits were either held at 23 oC for 16 days or stored at 1 oC for 50 days. Fruits were removed from cold storage at 10 -day intervals and allowed to ripe at 23 °C for five days. A delay of climacteric respiration and ethylene production by 1 -MCP treatment during ripening following harvest and cold storage was associated to a slow rate of fruit softening. 1 -MCP treatment also delayed the loss of titratable acidity and changes of flesh and skin color, whereas it {{had little or no}} effect on soluble solids content. 1 -MCP effects were concentration- and storage duration-dependent and, generally, a saturation fruit response to 1 -MCP occurred between 0. 5 and 1. 0 mL L- 1.
