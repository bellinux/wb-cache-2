5|$|On July 17 at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, deGrom {{pitched a}} {{complete}} game shutout against the Philadelphia Phillies, allowing only one hit and one walk while striking out seven opposing batters. His game score of 97 was tied for second-best in Mets {{history in a}} nine-inning game. DeGrom's final pitching appearance of the season came on September 1, when he faced the Miami Marlins. He underwent season-ending surgery on his ulnar nerve in late September in order to relieve discomfort in his elbow and numbness <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> which had plagued him during the 2016 season.|$|E
25|$|At the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City, Mexico, Gerhard Berger made {{a return}} despite {{continued}} pain <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> However, transmission and gearbox problems forced the Ferraris {{to retire from}} point-scoring positions for the third race straight. While they lamented their results, McLaren and Senna took a third win on the trot by a differing choice of tyres. Prost's choice, and the wrong set of tyres being given to him at a pit stop (which prompted team boss Ron Dennis to issue Prost a public apology after the race), sent him down the order to fifth. Patrese was second for Williams, while Alboreto doubled his efforts in Monaco by scoring third. Gabriele Tarquini {{was able to bring}} his barely pre-qualified AGS home in sixth for a well-celebrated point.|$|E
2500|$|After his cricket career, Pooley, {{as with so}} many of his {{contemporary}} cricketers, struggled {{financially and}} his gambling and drinking eventually led to the Lambeth workhouse. [...] In 1899 the writer Alfred Pullin traced and interviewed many old cricketers. [...] He described Pooley's hands as [...] "mere lumps of deformity" [...] and attributed their condition to rheumatism caused by drink. Pooley became angry at this, banging the table to show he had no feeling <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> and that it was cricket rather than [...] "rheumatics" [...] that had put him in the workhouse. [...] He took Pullin outside to show he could still catch a ball. [...] Pooley lived on until 1907, dying in poverty, while his team mates from the 1877 tour were lauded as the first Test cricketers.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Guitar World, posted on November 12, 2008, about the making of his upcoming new EVH Wolfgang guitar from Fender, Eddie Van Halen said, in regard to new Van Halen music, [...] "I'll be making music 'til the day I die. I've done all kinds of stuff, and more is coming. I can't tell you exactly when right now. Wolfgang is in the 12th grade {{and he needs to}} graduate first. Then I'm getting married in June. We'll pick it up after that." [...] Eddie underwent surgery on his left hand in 2009, following some treatment for arthritis as he felt pain <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> during the 2007 tour. In {{an interview}} with Glide Magazine appearing in the May 2010 issue, Dweezil Zappa commented that Eddie had played him [...] "new stuff from his record." [...] It was not clear from the interview if the music was intended for a new Van Halen record.|$|E
