25|$|A <b>key</b> <b>provision</b> {{of each of}} {{the laws}} {{respectively}} organizing the Territory of New Mexico and the Territory of Utah was that slavery would be decided by local option, called popular sovereignty. That was an important repudiation of the idea behind the failed to prohibit slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico.|$|E
25|$|On August 31, 1980, {{representatives of}} {{workers at the}} Gdańsk Shipyard, led by an {{electrician}} and activist Lech Wałęsa, signed the Gdańsk Agreement with the government that ended their strike. Similar agreements were concluded in Szczecin (the Szczecin Agreement) and in Silesia. The <b>key</b> <b>provision</b> of these agreements was the guarantee of the workers' right to form independent trade unions {{and the right to}} strike. Following the successful resolution of the largest labor confrontation in communist Poland's history, nationwide union organizing movements swept the country.|$|E
25|$|In 1853 {{the company}} again sought an {{extended}} lease. Again {{they were planning}} a new even lower level to exploit ore reserves at greater depths in the mine, and this would require years of work. This time the landowners {{took the opportunity to}} introduce some changes to the terms of the lease. William Marshall in particular was critical of the company’s lack of engineering expertise and poor long-term planning. A <b>key</b> <b>provision</b> of the new lease was the appointment of an independent consultant engineer as mineral agent, paid for by the company but appointed jointly by the landowners and the company. Other provisions sought to mitigate some of the nuisances caused by a working mine in the area, from pollution of the river and the lake, to the state of the roads and the cleanliness of the workers’ accommodation.|$|E

25|$|Among Toledo’s {{initiatives}} {{designed to}} generate revenue and transform the economy were plans to privatize national industries. The first major effort {{of this kind}} was the $167 million sale of two state-owned electric companies. Protests {{in the city of}} Arequipa turned violent as Peruvians reacted with anger to the prospect of layoffs and higher priced electricity. They also recalled that billions of dollars earned from privatization under the Fujimori administration had ended up filling the president’s personal bank accounts. Toledo decided not to carry out the sale of electric companies, but promised to continue privatization efforts, which were a <b>key</b> <b>provision</b> of a deal struck with the International Monetary Fund. Toledo had promised to bring in US$700 million through privatization in 2001 and US$1 billion in 2002. Although he failed to meet these goals, the IMF approved a $154 million disbursement to Peru in December 2002 and allowed the country to raise the fiscal deficit target in its agreement.|$|E
2500|$|Shanker and Hobart had, however, ignored a <b>key</b> <b>provision</b> in {{the merger}} {{agreement}} approved by both NEA and AFT.

NYSUT was ultimately required to pay NEA a multi-million dollar settlement.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder {{announced}} that the Obama administration's Justice Department had determined that a <b>key</b> <b>provision</b> of the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional and, as a result, the administration would no longer argue {{in support of the}} act's constitutionality in court. Paul issued a statement to Iowa Republicans criticizing the Obama administration's position, saying: [...] "Like the majority of Iowans, I believe that marriage is between one man and one woman and must be protected. I supported the Defense of Marriage Act, which used Congress’ constitutional authority to define what other states have to recognize under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, to ensure that no state would be forced to recognize a same sex marriage license issued in another state." ...|$|E
2500|$|The House Democrats were fast to react, {{coming out}} on June 12 against the Supreme Court. Claiming lead from Justice Ruth Ginsburg's dissenting opinion, which invited the Congress {{to take action}} by {{amending}} the law, the Democrats announced their intention to intervene: House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller said that a bill was to be passed to avoid future court rulings in line with Ledbetter, clearly putting that [...] "a <b>key</b> <b>provision</b> of the legislation will {{make it clear that}} discrimination occurs not just when the decision to discriminate is made, but also when someone becomes subject to that discriminatory decision, and when they are affected by that discriminatory decision, including each time they are issued a discriminatory paycheck", as said by Rep. Miller.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{retirement}} of Barney Frank (D-Massachusetts) in 2012, Waters became the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee. On July 24, 2013, Waters {{voted in favor of}} Amendment 100 included in H.R. 2397 Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2014. The amendment targeted domestic surveillance activities, specifically that of the National Security Agency, and if ultimately passed would have limited the flexibility of the NSA's interpretation of the law to collect sweeping data on U.S. citizens. [...] Amendment 100 was rejected 217–205. On March 27, 2014, Waters introduced a discussion draft of the Housing Opportunities Move the Economy Forward Act of 2014 known as the HOME Forward Act of 2014. A <b>key</b> <b>provision</b> of the bill includes the collection of 10 basis points for “every dollar outstanding mortgages collateralizing covered securities” estimated to be approximately $5 billion a year. [...] These funds would be directed to three funds that support affordable housing initiatives, with 75% going to the National Housing trust fund. [...] The National Housing Trust Fund will then provide block grants to states to be used primarily to build, preserve, rehabilitate, and operate rental housing that is affordable to the lowest income households, and groups including seniors, disabled persons [...] and low income workers. [...] The National Housing Trust was enacted in 2008, but has yet to be funded. In 2009, Waters co-sponsored Rep. John Conyers' bill calling for reparations for slavery to be paid to black Americans.|$|E
