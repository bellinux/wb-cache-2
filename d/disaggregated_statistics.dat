40|$|The growing {{awareness}} {{and demand for}} gender responsive statistics to inform policies, planning and decision making necessitates a cautious effort in the collation of gender responsive statistics to distinguish their needs and access to resources. The demand is driven by various international, regional and national development frameworks and interventions targeting gender equality. The Beijing Platform for Action underlines production and use of gender <b>disaggregated</b> <b>statistics</b> for policy formulation, planning and implementation {{as one of the}} specific actions. Countries are also required to generate gender responsive data to monitor their progress on achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.

However, information on the spatial patterns in wood {{production is}} limited and often available only for larger administrative units. In this study, we developed high-resolution wood production maps for European forests. We collected wood production statistics for 29 European countries from 2000 to 2010, as well as comprehensive sets of biophysical and socioeconomic location factors. We used regression analyses to produce maps indicating the harvest likelihood on a 1 × 1 km 2 grid. These likelihood maps were validated using national forest inventory plot data.

We verified the resulting wood production maps by correlating predicted and observed wood production {{at the level of}} smaller administrative units not used for generating the wood production maps. We conclude that (i) productivity, tree species composition and terrain ruggedness are the most important location factors that determine the spatial patterns of wood production at the pan-European scale and that (ii) incorporating these location factors substantially improves the results of <b>disaggregating</b> wood production <b>statistics</b> compared to a disaggregation based on forest cover only.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the evolution of}} absolute employment specialization along the course of economic growth of EU– 25 countries. We focus on {{the degree to which}} EU economies concentrate labor force in a few sectors/industries.

Using nonparametric and semiparametric estimation techniques, we estimate the relationship between employment specialization and the development level, controlling for the inclusion of additional determinants of the diversification process. The main findings are in line with the trends revealed in analogical empirical studies using industrial data for international samples of countries: also within the enlarged EU there is a tendency towards decreasing absolute specialization of employment at initial phases of growth matched with an upward rising trend after over passing the GDP per capita level of about 16000 US $ (const 2000). ...|$|E

This work therefore aims at using space-based technologies to estimate, complement and extend exposure data at multiple scales, over large areas {{and at a}} comparatively low cost for {{the case of the}} city of Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. At a neighborhood scale, an analysis of urban structures using medium-resolution optical satellite images is performed. Applying image classification and change-detection analysis to a time-series of Landsat images, the urban environment can be delineated into areas of relatively homogeneous urban structure types, which can provide a first estimate of an exposed building stock (e. g., approximate age of structures, composition and distribution of predominant building types). At a building-by-building scale, a more detailed analysis of the exposed building stock is carried out using a high-resolution Quickbird image.

A strong need to carry out advanced estimates of regional accounts in a quicker time has emerged. The Kalman filter could be the right tool if we use a short time series span. Since it is available a larger data set from ISTAT web site (www. istat. it) from 1980 up to 2004, a different approach will be performed here, and is mainly based on Spatial Panel recently used by Elhorst and Baltagi.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{understand}} the political sociology of Maoist insurgency in India {{using a combination of}} <b>disaggregated</b> <b>statistics</b> and qualitative data. The vast majority of insurgent leaders are from dominant or upper caste, middle class backgrounds. Their participation in the insurgency can be understood in terms of ideology and short-term processes of mobilization. The Maoist insurgents provide a unified organizational structure for two separate sections of society. On the one hand, are untouchable or dalit landless laborers who suffer economic exploitation at the hands of higher caste landowners. On the hand are tribal or adivasi landowning cultivators whose relative autonomy has come under increasing pressure over the past two centuries as the state has established control over natural resources in their area. Their support for the insurgents does not just manifest itself from exploited untouchables’ and oppressed tribals’ positions in the social structure as structural theories would assume. Rather, the insurgents provide them with collective incentives in order to encourage their support. The actors at the macro and micro levels have very different reasons for participating in the insurgency. The insurgent leaders aim to capture state power through a Protracted People’s War, while the objectives of supporters at the micro-level tend to be more concerned with local and short-term issues. The insurgency should be conceptualised as a state building enterprise in which the interests of supporters at all levels are served by seizing local political power and the building of a base area. The thesis demonstrates that the insurgency is expanding most rapidly in the central Indian tribal belt. I use a case study to show that not all tribal communities support the insurgents. Some oppose them, either because their interests have been harmed by the presence of the insurgents, or {{as a result of a}} variety of endogenous mechanisms. This indicates that insurgency is a more dynamic and complex process than structural and rational actor theories allow for. The thesis finishes by placing the subject of indigenous communities and insurgency in the global context. It demonstrates that, while so-called indigenous communities listed by the Minorities at Risk project amount to 4. 8 % of the world’s population, they were involved in 43 % of the intra-state conflict years listed by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program Armed Conflict Dataset between 1946 and 2010.

We estimate the respective average and median tax burden of small, medium-sized and big corporations in Germany for the period 1998 to 2007 using enterprises micro panel data by applying OLS and quantile regression techniques. We find that the average tax burden levied on profit over the ten years was about 24 %, and thus lower than forward-looking techniques suggest. The majority of small corporations did bear a significantly lower burden than the residual bigger corporations. We also provide evidence that medium-sized corporations faced a significantly higher median tax burden than big corporation. This implies an inverse U-shaped trajectory of median tax burden with respect to size of enterprise. Presumably big corporations are internationally operating and hence have more opportunities to manipulate the tax base. Hence, medium-sized corporations {{seem to have been}} disadvantaged to big corporations within the German corporation tax. Finally, the size of tax relief provided by the “Tax Reform 2000 ” was correlated positively with size of enterprise. This size-dependent tax burden identifies a so far neglected type of tax distortion. Future tax reforms hence also have to address size neutrality. ...|$|R

In the wake of numerous studies conducted worldwide about women since the United Nations’ Decade for Women (1976 - 1984), data appear sparse {{on the relationship between}} women’s work and women’s health in the agricultural setting to enable policy makers and program implementors to adequately address their health needs. Thus this study aimed to determine the nature of available information in the gender literature to enable us to understand the link between women’s productive farm work and their health status, and to elicit major implications for research to aid policy and program. The method used was a review and analysis of pertinent data in the research literature on agricultural women covering over two decades. Findings from the study reiterate the crucial role held by these women throughout the developing world in securing food for their families and communities, but then this role is not performed without adverse consequences to their health. The major consequences include female reproductive health risks owing particularly to women’s use and exposure to hazardous agrochemicals, farm-related accidents or physical injuries, ergonomic problems resulting from women’s use of tools or technology that are better suited to men, and nutritional deficiencies that are compounded by poverty and overwork. Other findings have surfaced two main research imperatives: the need for more updated and gender <b>disaggregated</b> national <b>statistics</b> on the status of agricultural women in developing societies, and the necessity for addressing various identified gaps in the women’s work-and-health paradigm...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the current literature on market disciplining of the sovereign governments in two ways: Firstly, it distinguishes {{both sides of the}} market discipline hypothesis (MDH) by adopting 3 SLS to incorporate the contemporaneous feedback effects between primary structural budget balances and country default risk premium. Secondly, by utilizing the IMF's <b>disaggregated</b> government finance <b>statistics</b> data, structural primary budget balances are estimated to test the MDH for developing countries. The results show a disciplinary effect of the financial markets on the sovereign governments and the findings are robust to two alternative measurements of structural budget balances. After controlling for the exchange rate regime, the results confirm that sovereign governments are more disciplined in floating countries, while, in countries with fixed exchange rate regime, sovereigns seem to be irresponsive to the change in the default risk premium posed by the market. As for the market's response to change in fiscal indicators, 3 SLS estimation results show well-functioning financial markets in the sample countries. Controlling for political ideology does not change the conclusion but financial markets seem to function more efficient in the fixed exchange rate regime seeking countries. ...|$|R

For nonmonetary deprivation, six dimensions are identified using explanatory and confirmatory factor analyses, and a weighting system is applied for the aggregation of individual items into the dimension they represent. An application on Mozambique is conducted using the Household Budget Survey 2008 - 09 (IOF 08) data: estimates are provided at national level and also disaggregated at provincial and urban/rural level. Standard errors are provided using a recent methodology based on Jack-knife Repeated Replication. Our results contrast with previous findings based solely on Head Count statistics and give a more complete mapping of poverty in Mozambique. Monetary and non-monetary deprivation seem to have very different distribution patterns, especially when analysed at sub-national level and by area of residence. <b>Disaggregated</b> Head Count <b>statistics</b> produce rankings of provinces and urban/rural areas that greatly differ from estimates based on non-monetary dimensions.

40|$|International {{human rights}} {{agreements}} have always faced challenging questions concerning application and enforceability: What concretely must nation-states do {{to fulfill their}} commitments, and {{how can they be}} made to do it? This dissertation provides a multi-sited ethnographic analysis of the phenomenon of assessment – or evaluation – as a mode of governing states’ human rights obligations. It shows that processes of evaluation do much more than “check up” on states’ adherence to a pre-given model of compliance. Instead, through evaluation practice, I contend, state, inter-governmental, and non-governmental actors interpret, negotiate, and ultimately make and re-make what it means to comply. I investigate assessment {{in the context of the}} United Nations human rights framework on racial discrimination, anchored in the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. My study is organized around three procedures UN agencies prescribe for states that have ratified this Convention. One is an external review procedure conducted by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The other two are internal “self-evaluations” to be undertaken by states themselves: the production of ethno-racially <b>disaggregated</b> census <b>statistics,</b> and the creation of national action plans. My research on both of these focuses on national processes carried out in Costa Rica, a state that many UN agencies hope to make a regional model for combating discrimination. The UN framework conceptualizes racial discrimination very broadly and in relation to a wide range of subject-matter areas. In each of my sites, I examine how constellations of actors and knowledge infrastructures determine which social, political, and economic problems oblige state remedy under the framework’s provisions. The dissertation draws attention to the varied epistemological commitments, interpretive openings, and social relations through which UN and Costa Rican state actors render knowledge of discrimination in the course of assessment practice. It further highlights how procedural forms themselves shape, foreground, and filter what gets named as discrimination, and who as its subjects. I thus show that assessments constitute dynamic processes through which actors adapt human rights norms’ meanings and mandates, and importantly, multiply and differentiate what count as obligations across time and states...|$|R
40|$|In the Mediterranean Sea, {{structured}} and standardized monitoring programs of marine resources were set {{only in the}} last decades, so the analysis of changes in marine communities over longer time scale has to rely on other sources. In this work, we used seven decades (1945 – 2014) of <b>disaggregated</b> landings <b>statistics</b> for the Northern Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean) to infer changes in the ecosystem. Analysis of landings composition was enriched with the application of a suite of ecological indicators (e. g., trophodynamic indicators, such as the primary production required to sustain the catches—PPR; size-based indicators, such as the large species indicator—LSI; other indicators, such as the elasmobranchs-bony fish ratio—E/B ratio). Indicators were further compared with main ecosystem drivers, i. e., fishing capacity, nutrient loads and climate change. Species most vulnerable to fishing (i. e., elasmobranchs and large-sized species) dramatically declined {{at the beginning of the}} industrialization of fishery that occurred right afterwards World War II, as can be inferred by the negative drop of LSI and E/B ratio in the mid- 1950 s. However, until the mid- 1980 s landings and PPR increased due to improvements in fishing activities (e. g., the introduction of more efficient fishing gears) increasing fishing capacity, high productivity of the ecosystem. Overall, the effects of fishing were buffered by an increase in productivity in the period of high nutrient discharge (up to mid- 1980 s), while significant changes in fish community structure were already occurring. From the mid- 1980 s, a reduction in nutrient load caused a decline in productivity but the food-web structure was already modified and unable to support, or recover from, such unbalanced situation, resulting in the collapse of landings. This collapse is coherent with alternative stable states hypothesis, typical of complex real systems, that implies drastic interventions that go beyond fisheries management and include regulation of nutrient release for recovery. The work highlights that, despite poor capabilities to track species dynamics, landings and applied indicators might help to shed light on the long-term dynamics of marine communities, thus contributing to place current situation in an historical framework with potential for supporting management...|$|R
40|$|Legacy {{carriers}} developed hub {{networks to}} achieve {{a high concentration of}} operations, increase frequency, and serve multiple Origin-Destination markets with maximum efficiency. By contrast, the rapid emergence of low-cost carriers (LCCs) is mainly based on a low-fare entry strategy in point-to-point markets competing with the traditional connecting paths offered by the legacy carriers via their hubs. This thesis examines the traffic and revenue impacts of an LCC developing a point-to-point network in a legacy hub network environment. To this purpose, we use the Passenger Origin-Destination Simulator (PODS) to perform all quantitative evaluations. Modeling the choice of travelers with regard to flight schedules and fares, as well as the airlines' revenue management systems, PODS allows one to investigate the changes in aggregate and <b>disaggregate</b> airline <b>statistics</b> following the introduction of low-fare service on point-to-point routes. The first goal of the thesis is to review and update models of passenger choice between connecting legacy and non-stop low-cost paths. The review of the literature on air traveler choice provides parameters and benchmarks critical to the calibration of PODS. (cont.) We then simulate a LCC entry case, and calibrate the Passenger Decision Model (PDM) embedded in PODS through sensitivity analysis. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, we analyze the introduction of LCC operations in two legacy hub networks, a theoretical symmetric and a more realistic asymmetric network. Two different LCC strategies were considered. In the first case, LCC routes are added to the legacy network with one daily frequency, while the second strategy is characterized by two daily flights in each market entered by the low-fare airline. For both networks and strategies, the analysis reveals that legacy revenues are greatly reduced whereas the decrease in legacy traffic is limited even with extended and aggressive low-cost competition, allowing the legacy carriers to maintain their network load factors at high levels. The lower fares implemented by the LCC and matched by the legacy airlines lead to the reduced legacy revenues. However, legacy carriers can rely on demand stimulation, as well as great demand in local hub markets and connecting markets not served by the LCC, to replace traffic captured by the new entrant. by Gregory Zerbib.

40|$|Background: People {{with disabilities}} are at {{increased}} risk of poverty, particularly in low-and middle-income countries. However, recent evidence suggests that this association is more nuanced than previously anticipated and that we need better data to understand the opportunity and out-of-pocket costs that diverse groups of people with disabilities may experience. Objective: This paper discusses if disability is associated with opportunity cost and loss of income both on the individual and household level in South Africa, and if these costs differ depending on disability type and severity. Methods: For this purpose, the paper analyses General Household Survey 2011 data (people between 15 and 59) using descriptive <b>statistics</b> <b>disaggregated</b> via disability type and severity. The paper also assesses if social grants counteract these costs and reduce economic vulnerability. Results: The analysis of the data reveals that people {{with disabilities are}} affected by issues relating to multidimensional poverty such as lower educational attainment and fewer employment opportunities. In addition, households of people with disabilities (with the exception of milder visual problems) earn significantly less than households without people with disabilities, and this particularly applies to households with people with severe disabilities. This vulnerability also varies by disability type. The country’s social protection mechanisms, in terms of social grants, counteract economic vulnerability to some extent but do not consider the nuanced economic impact of diverse conditions nor the increased out-of-pocket costs related to disability. Conclusions: This calls for more equitable social protection mechanisms that include accessible services, livelihood programmes and disability benefits...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{safety of}} {{children}} younger than 10 years on motorized two-wheeled vehicles (MTWs) in low- and middle-income countries receives substantial attention from global road safety advocates. However, there is little empirical evidence available to describe {{the magnitude of the}} problem. Therefore, we constructed a population-level database of road traffic injury <b>statistics</b> <b>disaggregated</b> by age (< 5, 5 – 9, 10 + years) and mode of transport. Our database included mortality data from 44 countries and 5 Indian cities, and hospital admissions from 17 countries. The MTW fleet in these settings ranged from 2 % to 70 % of all registered vehicles. We find that children under 5 years averaged 0. 05 % (SD 0. 13 %) of all road traffic deaths, and 5 – 9 year olds averaged 0. 11 % (SD 0. 25 %). Even in regions with high prevalence of MTWs, young children comprised at most 1. 5 % of all road traffic deaths and 5. 8 % of all MTW deaths. Young children were a slightly larger proportion of all road traffic deaths in countries where MTWs were more common. However, after adjusting for population age structure, this effect was no longer evident. The percentage of child road traffic injuries that are due to MTWs increased with increasing MTW use, but at a much lower rate. Our findings suggest that children may be at lower risk from MTW crashes than previously assumed, and certainly at a lower risk than as pedestrians. Further studies are needed to explain the underlying mechanisms that regulate risk of road users...|$|R

In order to clearly distinguish between their specific features and coverage, a comparative description of eco-industries versus the bio-economy is included here. The current EU policy approach to the bio-economy is sketched in the second section of this report. With the purpose of defining the bio-economy’s scope and its internal flows, the third section advances an integrated analytical perspective on the EU bio-economy. This perspective builds upon descriptions provided in the related Commission documents. Its potential use in support of the future Bio-economy Observatory is elaborated, together with several associated methodological aspects. In the fourth section, the datasets, methods and models which could be used for measuring and monitoring the bio-economy’s drivers, development and impact are identified and grouped into five inter-related methodological modules. Further methodological clarification is provided as to i) the need for complementing a sectoral approach to the bio-economy with other perspectives, including the product-chain approach, and ii) the usefulness of inventory data from the European Commission’s life-cycle based resource efficiency indicators. Other relevant data sources are also described. In addition, in light of the limited availability of statistical data on new bio-based products and processes, the need for further <b>disaggregated</b> product-level <b>statistics</b> for bio-based products and company-level research is also discussed. Current standardization and research activities on issues such as harmonization of sustainability certification systems for biomass production, conversion systems and trade, sustainability assessment of technologies, and environmental performance of products are reviewed in the fifth section. Based on the observation that {{it would be impossible to}} obtain all required data for bio-economy monitoring from official statistical sources, we propose in the sixth section a general-purpose questionnaire which could serve as a basis for prospective surveys. It is intended to be further refined and adjusted, in collaboration with the sector-relevant European technology platforms and industry associations and other relevant stakeholders, according to the specific profile of each sector, product group or firm type to be included in any future surveys.

40|$|International audienceThe French soil-test {{database}} (Base de Données d'Analyses de Terre: BDAT) is {{populated with}} analytical results of agricultural topsoil samples requested by farmers for fertilization planning. The coordinates of the farms are unknown due to data confidentiality policies, {{and the best}} available georeference is at level of municipality. We compared four approaches for mapping soil texture of agricultural land in Region Centre (France) using BDAT data: 1) a reference approach of mapping {{the mean of the}} aggregated data by municipality, 2) a boosted regression tree (BRT) model fitted with the municipality-averaged data, 3) area-to-point cokriging (AToP CK), and 4) a regression kriging version of this (AToP RCK, for which the BRT predictions were used to give the trend). Specifically, parameters for these last two approaches were fitted through the summary statistics approach to AToP kriging, which accounts for the full set of municipality summary statistics data (i. e. the mean, variance and number of measurements from each municipality). We could thus determine whether more complex and statistically-challenging approaches improve our knowledge on the spatial distribution of soil texture compared with maps of data aggregated by municipality. Texture data from 105 sites form the French soil monitoring network (Réseau de Mesures de la Qualité des Sols: RMQS) were used for independent validation. In general, the R 2 was greater for sand (average R 2 = 0. 69) and silt (average R 2 = 0. 72) than for clay (average R 2 = 0. 40). The three methods for <b>disaggregating</b> the summary <b>statistics</b> data (BRT, AToP CK, and AToP RCK) showed similar prediction accuracies—although BRT predictions showed the greatest bias—and were better than the BDAT reference approach. AToP RCK was able to give similar prediction accuracy to BRT modelling alone, reduced the bias considerably, and gave a reasonable (although slightly conservative) assessment of prediction uncertainty. The results indicate that geostatistical methods for change of support expand the utility of aggregated data from soil-test databases...|$|R
40|$|Governments compile their {{agricultural}} statistics in tabular form by administrative area, which gives no {{clue to the}} exact locations where specific crops are actually grown. Such data are poorly suited for early warning and assessment of crop production. 10 -Daily satellite image time series of Andalucia, Spain, acquired since 1998 by the SPOT Vegetation Instrument in combination with reported crop area statistics were used to produce the required crop maps. Firstly, the 10 -daily (1998 – 2006) 1 -km resolution SPOT-Vegetation NDVI-images were used to stratify the study area in 45 map units through an iterative unsupervised classification process. Each unit represents an NDVI-profile showing changes in vegetation greenness over time which is assumed {{to relate to the}} types of land cover and land use present. Secondly, the areas of NDVI-units and the reported cropped areas by municipality were used to <b>disaggregate</b> the crop <b>statistics.</b> Adjusted R-squares were 98. 8 % for rainfed wheat, 97. 5 % for rainfed sunflower, and 76. 5 % for barley. Relating statistical data on areas cropped by municipality with the NDVI-based unit map showed that the selected crops were significantly related to specific NDVI-based map units. Other NDVI-profiles did not relate to the studied crops and represented other types of land use or land cover. The results were validated by using primary field data. These data were collected by the Spanish government from 2001 to 2005 through grid sampling within agricultural areas; each grid (block) contains three 700 m × 700 m segments. The validation showed 68 %, 31 % and 23 % variability explained (adjusted R-squares) between the three produced maps and the thousands of segment data. Mainly variability within the delineated NDVI-units caused relatively low values; the units are internally heterogeneous. Variability between units is properly captured. The maps must accordingly be considered “small scale maps”. These maps can be used to monitor crop performance of specific cropped areas because of using hypertemporal images. Early warning thus becomes more location and crop specific because of using hypertemporal remote sensing...|$|R
40|$|The {{overarching}} {{question for}} this study is: {{to what extent are}} teachers using summative assessment data in a formative way? A survey research design study was implemented to address this question. A web-based survey was administered to elementary, middle, and high school teachers in a large, suburban school division in central Virginia. The survey data were used to determine the frequency with which teachers administered specific types of summative assessments, analyzed student summative assessment data, made changes in their instructional practice {{as a result of their}} analysis, and the level of teachers’ assessment literacy. The results of this study suggest teachers are administering a variety of summative assessments, with varying frequencies, throughout the year and analyzing data on a regular basis. Teachers’ formative use of summative assessment data is most often demonstrated through analysis using central tendency <b>statistics.</b> <b>Disaggregating</b> data by content standards or student subgroups is not as frequently attempted. Regardless of the methods of data analysis, an overwhelming majority of teachers reported using assessment data results to evaluate their instructional practice and make changes to enhance student learning. The assessment literacy level of teachers did not appear to have any influence on the extent to which they use summative assessments in a formative way. However, assessment literacy scores did differ across teacher characteristics. High school teachers had a higher assessment literacy score than elementary school teachers, and teachers with graduate degrees scored higher than those with a bachelor’s degree. Experience mattered as well; more experienced teachers had a higher assessment literacy score than beginning teachers. Finally, science and mathematics teachers had a higher assessment literacy score than elementary teachers. The findings of this study give building administrators and staff development leaders insight into current instructional practices of teachers. Additionally, a general measure of assessment literacy establishes a baseline from which educational leaders can develop future training to raise the assessment literacy of teacher...|$|R

The epidemiology {{and control of}} urban malaria poses a number of specific challenges in comparison to rural areas, most notably the heterogeneous spatial distribution of transmission and the low state of immunity in the population. Interestingly, much less is currently known about malaria in urban settings than in rural areas. As a result there is an essential need {{for more information on}} disease burden, distribution and control strategies. In this multi-country study we undertook to study systematically key malariological features in four large SSA cities: Abidjan (Côte d’Ivoire), Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), Cotonou (Benin) and Dar es Salaam (United Republic of Tanzania). Objectives The general objective of this series of case studies was to further our understanding of malaria transmission and epidemiology in the urban environment in SSA, in view of developing and implementing effective control measures.

According to national statistics, approximately 240, 000 malaria cases were reported by health facilities in Abidjan in 2001 (40. 2 % of all consultations). The peak malaria incidence was in July-September. In the health facilities of the Yopougon commune, the malaria infection rates in presenting fever cases were 22. 1 % (under 1 year-old), 42. 8 % (1 - 5 years-old), 42. 0 % (6 - 15 years-old) and 26. 8 % (over 15 years-old), while those in the control group were 13. 0 %, 26. 7 %, 21. 8 % and 14. 6 %. Malaria prevalence in health facilities was homogenous in the different areas of Yopougon. The malaria-attributable fractions (MAFs) among presenting fever cases were 0. 12, 0. 22, 0. 27 and 0. 13 for the age groups listed above, suggesting that malaria played only a low to moderate role in fever episodes during the rainy season.

According to national statistics, approximately 240, 000 malaria cases were reported by health facilities in Abidjan in 2001 (40. 2 % of all consultations). The peak malaria incidence was in July-September. In the health facilities of the Yopougon commune, the malaria infection rates in presenting fever cases were 22. 1 % (under 1 year-old), 42. 8 % (1 - 5 years-old), 42. 0 % (6 - 15 years-old) and 26. 8 % (over 15 years-old), while those in the control group were 13. 0 %, 26. 7 %, 21. 8 % and 14. 6 %.

Among all patients, 10. 1 % used a mosquito net (treated or not) the night before the survey and this was protective (OR= 0. 52, 95 % CI 0. 29 - 0. 97). Travel to rural areas within the last three months was frequent (31 % of all respondents) and associated with a malaria infection (OR= 1. 75, 95 % CI 1. 25 - 2. 45). The health facility and breeding site mapping, as well as the school surveys could not be carried out because of political troubles. Ouagadougou: The field work was carried out in November-December 2002 at the start of cold and dry season. Seasonal variations in reported clinical malaria cases were marked. The highest incidence rate was reported from July to September and incidence rates went down in October-December until a low point during the dry season, from January to March. In 2001, there were 203, 466 simple malaria cases (29. 3 - 41. 4 % of consultations) and 19 deaths reported among 596, 365 consultations in all public health facilities. A further 20, 071 complicated malaria cases were reported. The malaria infection rates in presenting fever cases were 12. 1 % (under 1 year-old), 25. 9 % (1 - 5 years-old), 37. 1 % (6 - 15 years-old) and 18. 0 % (over 15 years-old), while those in the control group were 14. 3 %, 14. 4 %, 34. 5 % and 19. 8 %. The MAFs among presenting fever cases were 0. 00, 0. 13, 0. 04 and 0. 00 for the age groups cited above, suggesting that malaria played only a small role in fever episodes at the start of cold and dry season. The school parasitaemia prevalence was rather high (overall: 48. 3 %) and there was heterogeneity between the 3 surveyed schools (31. 6 %, 37. 6 %, 73. 1 %). The mapping of Anopheles sp. breeding sites correlated with this gradient of endemicity between the urban centre and the periphery of Ouagadougou. We found a link between malaria infections and urban agriculture activities and the availability of water supply. In total 42. 0 % of patients used a mosquito net the night before the survey and this was protective (OR= 0. 74, 95 % CI 0. 54 - 1. 00). Travelling to a rural area (8. 7 % of all respondents) did not increase the infection risk (OR= 1. 14, 95 % CI 0. 70 - 1. 90). Cotonou: The field work was carried out in February-March 2003. In 2002, there were 100, 257 reported simple malaria cases and 12, 195 complicated malaria cases reported for 289, 342 consultations in the public health facilities of Cotonou. Between 1996 and 2002, on average 34 % of total consultations were attributed to simple malaria and 1 - 4. 2 % to complicated malaria cases. There was no clear seasonal pattern. The malaria infection rates in presenting fever cases were 0 % (under 1 year-old), 6. 8 % (1 - 5 years-old), 0 % (6 - 15 years-old) and 0. 9 % (over 15 years-old), while those in the control group were 1. 4 %, 2. 8 %, 1. 3 % and 2. 0 %. The MAFs among presenting fever cases were 0. 04 in the 1 - 5 years-old and 0 in the over 15 years-old. MAFs could not be calculated for the other two age groups. Hence, malaria played only a small role in fever episodes {{at the end of the}} rainy season. In the school parasitaemia surveys, a malaria infection was found in 5. 2 % of all samples. The prevalence of parasitaemia in the centre, intermediate and periphery areas was 2. 6 %, 9. 0 % and 2. 5 %, respectively. In total 69. 2 % of patients used a mosquito net the night before the survey (OR= 0. 61, not significant). Traveling to a rural area (5. 8 % of all respondents) did not increase the infection risk since none of those who had traveled had parasitaemia. No mapping of health facilities and breeding sites could be carried out. Dar es Salaam: The field work was carried out in June-August 2003. An|$|R
