5|$|Following the {{previous}} season, several other wing players left the team. Caris LeVert graduated. Aubrey Dawkins transferred {{to play for}} the UCF Knights. Kameron Chatman announced his intention to transfer. He mostly came off the bench, although he <b>did</b> <b>start</b> one game due to a bookkeeping error on December 17 against Maryland Eastern Shore. Late in the season, he began producing The Dak and Dunc Show podcast with teammate Andrew Dakich for WCBN-FM Sports, which was available on iTunes. The team won the 2017 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament and reached the sweet sixteen round of the 2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament.|$|E
5|$|For the 2013–14 season, Auguste was {{expected}} to play a larger role after Cooley graduated and coach Mike Brey cited him as a major player. Though he <b>did</b> <b>start</b> 13 games out of 30, he stayed third choice with Sherman and Tom Knight preferred. He recorded his first college double-double against Clemson having 14 points and 12 rebounds, followed by no-shows. He finished his sophomore season with 6.7 points and 4.3 rebounds in nearly 17 minutes per game on average.|$|E

5|$|Giampaolo Caruso led {{the group}} into Ans and towards the {{climb to the}} finish. At {{the foot of the}} climb, Daniel Moreno, Caruso's teammate, {{attacked}} and built a small gap ahead of the group. The group did not initially chase him, as all the other riders looked for Valverde to do the work. Eventually Valverde <b>did</b> <b>start</b> to chase Moreno and caught him at the final bend. He opened his sprint from a long way out, with Joaquim Rodríguez (Katusha) right behind him. Rodríguez slowed as they approached the line, however, and Valverde took the victory. Julian Alaphilippe came around Rodríguez in the final metres to take second place.|$|E
5|$|Robinson <b>did</b> <b>start</b> Michigan's {{season opener}} against Connecticut. In the first half, he rushed for 131 {{yards and a}} {{touchdown}} on 15 carries for an average of 8.7 yards per carry. He finished the game with 383 yards of total offense, including 186 passing yards (19 of 22 passing) and 197 rushing yards on 29 carries (6.9 yards per carry). Robinson's rushing yardage against UConn was the most ever by a Michigan quarterback. He also broke Michigan's single-game record for total offense with 383 yards. For his efforts Robinson earned Big Ten Conference Offensive Player of the Week, AT ESPN All-America Player of the Week, and Walter Camp Football Foundation National Offensive Player of the Week recognition.|$|E
5|$|Route 112 {{was first}} {{assigned}} in the 1928 state numbering of state highways in Pennsylvania. The route, when originally assigned, <b>did</b> <b>start</b> in Markham, but at an intersection with U.S. Route 1. The route's northern terminus {{remained the same}} in the route's entire lifetime. In 1941, the southern terminus was adjusted from the intersection with U.S. Route 1 (the Baltimore Pike) to an intersection with U.S. Route 322 near Markham. Although they made the adjustment, PA 112 ended up becoming one of the many routes decommissioned in 1946, when the commonwealth of Pennsylvania removed several hundred miles from their system. The designation has not been re-used since the 1946 removal.|$|E

5|$|Combined {{with the}} Domesday Survey, the Pipe rolls {{contributed to the}} {{centralisation}} of financial records by the Norman kings (reigned 1066–1154) of England that was ahead of contemporary Western European monarchies; the French, for instance, {{did not have an}} equivalent system of accounting until the 1190s. The exact form of the records, kept in a roll instead of a book, was also unique to England, although why England kept some of its administrative records in this form is unclear. A set of Norman rolls, drafted differently, are extant in a few years for the reigns of Kings Henry II (reigned 1154–1189) and Richard I (reigned 1189–1199), who also ruled the Duchy of Normandy in France. It is believed that the Norman rolls were started {{about the same time as}} the English, but due to lack of survival of the earlier Norman rolls, it is unclear exactly when they <b>did</b> <b>start.</b> An Irish Exchequer produced Irish Pipe rolls, and much like the English Pipe rolls, the earliest surviving Irish Pipe roll, that of 1212, does not appear to be the first produced.|$|E

25|$|On 16 September 2011 {{the results}} were {{published}} of the measurements of radioactive cesium in rice. The results were known of around 60 percent of all test-locations. Radioactive materials were detected in 94 locations, or 4.3 percent of the total. But the highest level detected so far, in Fukushima prefecture, was 136 becquerels per kilogram, {{about a quarter of}} the government's safety limit of 500 Becquerel per kilogram. Tests were conducted in 17 prefectures, and were completed in more than half of them. In 22 locations radioactive materials were detected in harvested rice. The highest level measured was 101.6 becquerels per kilogram, or one fifth of the safety limit. Shipments of rice <b>did</b> <b>start</b> in 15 prefectures, including all 52 municipalities in the prefecture Chiba. In Fukushima shipments of ordinary rice <b>did</b> <b>start</b> in 2 municipalities, and those of early-harvested rice in 20 municipalities.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} Can-Car's success in other markets, {{as early as}} 1981 the {{government}} had considered selling UTDC to the private sector.

If the company <b>did</b> <b>start</b> a manufacturing side, it would be inappropriate for the company to remain government owned. The Can-Car deal put this on hold for a time.|$|E

In 1998, Moore began developing three-time ARCA champion Tim Steele for a run at Winston Cup with sponsorship from Nike and Sony. Steele had been recovering from injuries sustained in a crash at Atlanta, {{and with the help of}} his father and sponsor Rescue Engine Formula, Steele would seek Rookie of the Year honors in 1999. Soon though, the deal fell apart. Loy Allen Jr. attempted the Brickyard 400, but failed to qualify. The team <b>did</b> <b>start</b> two races with Ted Musgrave, both races resulting in DNF's.|$|E
