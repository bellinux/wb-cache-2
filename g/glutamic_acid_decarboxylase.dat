25|$|Patients with SPS {{generally}} have high amounts of high <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> antibody titers. About 80 percent of SPS patients have GAD antibodies, {{compared with about}} {{one percent of the}} general population. The overwhelming majority of people who have GAD antibodies do not contract SPS, indicating that systematic synthesis of the antibody is not the sole cause of SPS. GAD, a presynaptic autoantigen, is generally thought to {{play a key role in}} the condition, but exact details of the way that autoantibodies affect SPS patients are not known. Most SPS patients with high-titer GAD antibodies also have antibodies that inhibit GABA-receptor-associated protein (GABARAP). Autoantibodies against amphiphysin and gephyrin are also sometimes found in SPS patients. The antibodies appear to interact with antigens in the brain neurons and the spinal cord synapses, causing a functional blockade with gamma-aminobutyric acid. This leads to GABA impairment, which probably causes the stiffness and spasms that characterizes SPS. There are low GABA levels in the motor cortexes of SPS patients.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of the article is to highlight various roles of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> like endogenic anticancer agent, conjugates to anticancer agents, and derivatives of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> as possible anticancer agents. Besides these emphases are given especially for two endogenous derivatives of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> such as glutamine and glutamate. Glutamine is a derivative of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> and is formed in the body from <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> and ammonia in an energy requiring reaction catalyzed by glutamine synthase.

So the transportation and metabolism of glutamine are also discussed for better understanding the role of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid.</b> Glutamates are the carboxylate anions and salts of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid.</b> Here the roles of various enzymes required for the metabolism of glutamates are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Using the {{corresponding}} amino-acid decarboxylases, the six amino-acids arginine, <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid,</b> histidine, lysine, ornithine and tyrosine {{were found to}} be free inside the cells of yeast. They are present when growth takes place in the absence of amino-acids, but their concentration may be increased by growing the organisms in media rich in amino-acids. Uptake of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> from the external medium is dependent on a source of energy which can be provided by the simultaneous fermenta-tion of glucose. The presence of an ammonium salt in the medium decreases both the rate a t which <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> enters the cells and the amount of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> which can be taken up. Certain other amino-acids exert a similar sparing action on the assimilation of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid,</b> which can be related to their efficiency as nitrogen sources for growth. The free <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> content of cells remains practically constant when the cells are suspended in salt solutions without amino-acids, but if glucose is also present then the concentration of free <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> inside the cells decreases steadily. When ammonia is also present the concentration of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> remains constant, suggesting that <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> is synthesized by the cells unde...|$|R
