25|$|Like {{all great}} artists, Licia's {{specific}} ingenuity as a singer, the originality of her art, {{lay in the}} fact that technique for this artist at least was always {{a means to an end}} and never an end in itself: for the salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the emotions. Any other approach would have been for Albanese contrary to the musical sense with which she was born, contrary to musical training she acquired, and, if such exists, contrary to her musical morality. It was this, Licia's uniqueness and musical mastery which drew me, which drew us, into the world of Mimi, Cio-Cio-San, Manon, Liu and Violetta week after week, year after year, <b>inviting</b> <b>me</b> to a place and places I had never been before. It is for all these reasons that Virgil Thomson was able to write of Licia's first Violetta: 'She did not sing the role, she recreated it for our times.' As we all know, Albanese's art is capable of the widest range of effects from the tragic to the comedic, from dramatic repertoire to the lyrical and even soubrette: and for anyone fortunate enough to have heard her rendition of operetta pieces, she leaves no doubt in the mind that she was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest.|$|E
500|$|... "Thank you, mister President-elect, for <b>inviting</b> <b>me</b> to your inauguration gala. I {{would like}} to take a moment from this very public {{ceremony}} to speak of something very personal. It concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E
2500|$|The Memphis Tour {{was held}} during February and March 2008. The tour began on 26 February with two concerts at The Bridge Hotel, Sydney, {{followed}} by sixteen further concerts in mainly theatre venues around Australia. After the first concert {{of the tour}} Sebastian spoke to Stuart Bocking from radio station 2UE about {{what it felt like}} to be on stage with the MGs, [...] "There were so many moments when I just had to take a step back and think 'This is unbelievable'. Like the history that is behind me, and I'm singing these songs. You know they start playing Dock Of The Bay, and the guys that played it are on the stage. You know the guy who wrote the song with Otis Redding is playing guitar. The same with Midnight Hour and Knock on Wood. All these songs that I keep starting. These guys played on the original and wrote the songs, and were the sound that created them." [...] During the interview Sebastian said he had just received a message from Dunn saying, [...] "Thank you for <b>inviting</b> <b>me</b> on this tour. I'm having the time of my life and it's an honour to play with you." ...|$|E

The peeping street lights appeared uncertain and dim on my either side as they feebly lit the hazy mist with an eerie, sleepy light. Often fingers of fog would reach out and suddenly snap about them, dimming them, shutting out yet more light. Queer, crazy, racing shadows leaped from nowhere in the all covering fog about me. An opening would yawn wide and <b>inviting</b> before <b>me,</b> my car lights would stab into it, I would follow. Slowly I drove on. Yet the fog, the fog - I, I couldn 2 ̆ 7 t escape it.

60|$|Restored to vigour in a moment, I {{ran over}} the few {{remaining}} mounds of decreasing size, and found myself on the level land beyond. Even then, however, the prospect was not <b>inviting.</b> All before <b>me</b> was dark and dismal, and I had evidently come {{on one of those}} dank, low-lying waste places which are found here and there in the neighbourhood of great cities. Places of waste and desolation, where the space is required for the ultimate agglomeration of all that is noxious, and the ground is so poor as to create no desire of occupancy even in the lowest squatter. With eyes accustomed to the gloom of the evening, and away now from the shadows of those dreadful dustheaps, I could see much more easily than I could a little while ago. It might have been, of course, that the glare in the sky of the lights of Paris, though the city was some miles away, was reflected here. Howsoever it was, I saw well enough to take bearings for certainly some little distance around me.|$|R

40|$|Some {{years ago}} I was {{introduced}} to the area of dialogue systems, and I was lucky it was by somebody who enjoys working with them. Since then, in his enthusiasm I have had a splendid referent. If the role of a supervisor is to guide and advice, it can not be in any other way rather than encouraging to develop the own ideas freely. Thank you Ramón. And to work freely it is necessary to go out of our laboratory, stop staring at our screen and find out what the others do, so that we can enrich our own contributions. Pasteur once said that science does not have any nationality, but that we scientists do.

40|$|I {{would like}} to express my deep {{appreciation}} and gratitude to my advisor Prof. Dr. Friedrich Breyer for accepting me as a doctoral student, for his patient guidance and mentorship from my first day at the University of Konstanz through to completion of this degree.

It is of high value to me that I could always count on him to support me in the rather complex and tedious process of data applications and in the collaboration with other institutions.

40|$|Development, Govt. of Maharashtra, all the {{aspiring}} women entrepreneurs present {{here this}} evening and ladies and gentlemen. I am delighted to be {{here this evening}} amongst all of you {{on the occasion of}} the launch of the Cosmos Bank’s Financial Inclusion Programme. I would like to thank the Cosmos Bank for <b>inviting</b> and giving <b>me</b> an opportunity to be a part of this initiative which seeks to address one of the most pressing issues of our times. Cosmos Bank is one of the oldest banks in the country and has recently completed 106 years of service. While nurturing the traditional values it has inherited, of serving the small customer, the bank has also moved with times and has prepared itself for the future, by adopting new technologies and advanced banking tools to add value to its services. Today’s initiative by the bank in launching this ambitious program of financial inclusion is very commendable. Huge participation by women entrepreneurs in today’s program, bodes well for the financial inclusion initiatives being undertaken by the bank. Like charity, virtues like thrift and discipline begin at home and what could be a better way than involving women in this ambitious program aimed at inculcating thrift and including, into the financial fold, the hitherto excluded. I am happy to note that the bank is not only helping the women by openin...|$|R
