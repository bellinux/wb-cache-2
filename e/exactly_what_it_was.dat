500|$|Smith {{commented on}} the surrealism of the Oscars experience: [...] "That's <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> surreal... I enjoy {{performing}} {{almost as much as}} I enjoy making up songs in the first place. But the Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was {{a lot of people who}} didn't come to hear me play. I wouldn't want to live in that world, but it was fun to walk around on the moon for a day." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was brought}} into the Manhattan Project in the early 1940s and given a team whose job it was to develop two {{separate}} metallic imploding bomb casings. These two designs were later named [...] "Fatman" [...] and [...] "Little Boy". As was common at that time, each cell of the Manhattan Project did not know <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that they were building. [...] Such {{was the case for}} Len's design team. [...] They did not realize it was the atomic bomb that they had worked on until the detonations over Japan in 1945.|$|E
2500|$|... "'Don't Tell Me' was {{the most}} {{unlikely}} follow-up to 2000's 'Music'. Stop-and-go guitar riffs, an atypical structure and peculiar lyrics ('Tell the bed not to lay/Like the open mouth of a grave/Not to stare up at me/Like a calf down on its knees') made it an unlikely hit to boot. But a hit is <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> earning Madonna her 27th Top 5 hit and 24th gold single (tying the Beatles). [...] "Don't Tell Me" [...] found Madonna at her most soulful, with a vocal performance reminiscent of the forceful tone of [...] "Express Yourself." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the Ironman European Championship race held in Frankfurt, Germany on 6 July 2008, {{in perfect}} weather conditions, Wellington {{recorded}} the second-fastest time to date {{by a woman}} over the Ironman distance, just 32seconds outside Paula Newby-Fraser's world record of 8:50:53 set in the 1994 Ironman Europe race, which was then held in Roth. Spectators were aware throughout the race that Wellington was close to breaking the world record, {{but she did not}} know <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> and in any case preferred to slow down to celebrate her victory over the last few kilometres, exchanging greetings and hi-fives with the crowd. Her coach said that her plan was [...] "to do it as easy as possible" [...] once she had got to the front. Other factors affecting her time were that she lost some of her nutrition on the bike (having to rely on the aid stations instead) and that the bike course was 2km too long.|$|E
2500|$|President Bush {{continued}} {{to campaign for}} the reauthorization of the Act. In a speech given in June 2005 to the Ohio State Highway Patrol Academy he reiterated his belief that key provisions should be reauthorized, and that [...] "The Patriot Act has accomplished <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> designed to do: it has protected American liberty and saved American lives. For {{the sake of our}} national security, Congress must not rebuild a wall between law enforcement and intelligence." [...] However, by this time the Act was as controversial as ever, {{and more than a few}} groups were campaigning against it. Aside from the EFF, the ACLU, the CDT and the EPIC, the Act had raised the ire of the American Library Association (ALA) and the American Booksellers Foundation for Freedom of Expression, who were all extremely concerned about the provisions of the Patriot Act, with a particular focus on section 215. An even more disparate group called the [...] "Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances" [...] (or PRCB) had also been formed to campaign against the Act, and were urging Congress to let the sections expire. Many unlikely bedfellows formed this group, and those numbered in its membership including the ACLU, the American Conservative Union, Gun Owners of America, and the United States Libertarian Party. The group had also supported the SAFE Act.|$|E
2500|$|Skepticism {{had existed}} even before Yamano's blog post. [...] The National Archive wrote in {{warning that the}} Archives version of the {{photograph}} {{did not have a}} date. [...] Dorothy Cochrane, a curator at the aeronautics department of the National Air and Space Museum, called the new evidence merely a [...] "blurry photograph" [...] and cited the existing evidence from radio transmissions that suggested that the Electra was at least close to Howland Island, 800 miles away from the Marshall Islands. [...] Author Fukiko Aoki, who researched and wrote a 1982 book, Looking for Amelia, was similarly critical before the revelations from Yamano. [...] Aoki located an elderly officer, part of the 1937 crew of the Kōshū Maru, who denied the ship's involvement. [...] Aoki subsequently researched the Kōshū Maru ship log which showed it as having been 1,500 miles away at the time of Earhart's disappearance. [...] It was also argued that to reach and somehow land on the remote atoll where she purportedly crashed would have required Earhart, though low on fuel, to change her northeast course as she neared Howland Island and fly hundreds of miles northwest. [...] Additionally, had Japanese officials found Earhart, they would have had substantial motivation to rescue and return her considering her fame. [...] The claims of a U.S. government cover-up also came under criticism; the documentary prominently mentions [...] "a report dated January 7, 1939 that Earhart was a prisoner in the Marshall Islands." [...] TIGHAR, a group that advocates the Gardner Island hypothesis of the disappearance, investigated the 1939 government report, which was not hard to find, and found that it was a report on an obvious prankan implausible tale found in France from someone who did not identify themselves. [...] The message told of being kidnapped by the Japanese, having his crew killed, finding Earhart in custody, then being sent to Europe on an unnamed Japanese ship. [...] TIGHAR wrote that the photo was [...] "neither lost nor evidence" [...] and that the picture had been [...] "exactly where it should be, and was <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> labeled to be, a picture of Jaluit Harbor," [...] criticizing the [...] "lost and misfiled photo" [...] element of The Lost Evidence as well.|$|E

6000|$|... "Listen," [...] she began. [...] "I {{do not ask}} {{you to tell me}} {{anything}} more about that night--I do not wish to hear anything. Tell me instead <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that you want from me!" ...|$|R

60|$|With that, he made {{a polite}} bow; and, with another to Miss Dartle, went away through the arch in the wall of holly by which he had come.

5000|$|... "The nostalgic, moist-eyed silences of Ulfat Idilbi's {{narrative}} {{could not}} be more different from the chilling, cynical silences in Zakaria Tamer's stories. The impassioned lacunae in Nizar Kabbani's proclaim <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> they are not saying explicitly, while the poet Muhammad al-Maghut's silence is sardonic, sneering both at the authorities and at himself, at the futility and absurdity of the human situation under authoritarian rule".|$|R
6000|$|He {{spent some}} little time however trying to recall <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{she had said}} about her children.

[...] "Incidental results {{of the collapse of}} her girlhood," [...] tried Mr. Brumley, [...] "when she married Harman." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ay, {{that did}} I, mates; but you mustn't expect wild {{descriptions}} about monsters with bulls' horns and asses' tails from me. I like truth, {{and the truth}} is, that the brute was so far away {{at the time we}} saw it, that not a man of us could tell <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like, and when we tried the description, we were all so different, that we gave it up; but we were all agreed on this point, that it certainly was the serpent." ...|$|E

60|$|As he {{said this}} he met her eyes, and had a sudden persuasion that she knew <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the {{telegram}} had told him, {{and that she was}} shocked at this gala-like treatment of such terrible news. He hesitated, feeling that he had to say something else, that he was socially inadequate, and then he decided that at any cost he must get his face away from her staring eyes. She made no movement to turn away. She seemed to be taking him in, recording him, for repetition, greedily, with every fibre of her being.|$|E
