40|$|International audienceTransposable {{elements}} (TEs) are mobile, repetitive DNA sequences {{that are}} almost ubiquitous in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. They have a large impact on genome structure, function and evolution. With the recent development of highthroughput sequencing methods, many genome sequences have become available, making possible comparative studies of TE dynamics at an unprecedented scale. Several methods have been proposed for the de novo identification of TEs in sequenced genomes. Most begin with the detection of genomic repeats, but the subsequent steps for defining TE families differ. High-quality TE annotations are available for the Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequences, providing a solid basis for the benchmarking of such methods. We compared the performance of specific algorithms for the clustering of interspersed repeats and found that only a particular combination of algorithms detected TE families with good recovery of the reference sequences. We then applied a new procedure for reconciling the different clustering results and classifying TE sequences. The whole approach was implemented in a pipeline using the REPET package. Finally, we show that our combined approach highlights the dynamics of well defined TE families by {{making it possible to}} identify structural variations among their copies. This approach makes it possible to annotate TE families and to study their diversification in a single analysis, improving our understanding of TE dynamics at the whole-genome scale and for diverse species.

40|$|Bgpi : Equipe 5 The GEMO project aims at characterizing genomic {{determinants}} of pathogenicity and evolutionary events involved in adaptation of 9 isolates from the M. oryzae/grisea clade differing in their host specificity. Eight strains from M. oryzae species complex {{and one of}} the related species M. grisea have been sequenced and assembled. De novo structural gene annotation was carried out using Eugene (Schiex, 2001) to predict genes and REPET (<b>Flutre,</b> 2011) to annotate Transposable Elements (TEs) in these 9 genomes. Four of them exhibited large supplementary genomic regions potentially issued from an unknown bacterial strain of the Burkholderia genus. An original strategy based on Gotham software (Ménigaud, 2012) was used to accurately quantify these regions in all the affected genome scaffolds. Functional gene annotations were performed using InterProScan. Databases and interfaces relying on the GMOD tools (gmod. org) were set up to browse annotations and facilitate further evolutionary analyses. In order to identify gene families, the entire set of the predicted and known proteins of the M. oryzae/grisea genomes were clustered using OrthoMCL (Li, 2003). A total of 20443 clusters (15326 assigned to M. oryzae/grisea and 5117 to Burkholderia) were obtained, including 8154 clusters comprising single copy genes shared by all genomes (core genome) and variable number of genome specific gene families (305 - 1550). Genes encoding putative Secreted Proteins (SPs) were identified in 2522 OrthoMCL clusters (2271 of M. oryzae/grisea and 251 of Burkholderia). Further analyses regarding genome-specific and rice-infecting specific genes and SPs will be presented. OrthoMCL families were processed to infer the phylogenetic reference genealogy of the M. oryzae/grisae complex. We also evaluated the ability of individual genes to recover the same topology as that supported by most of the genes by using a recent method based on multiple co-inertia analysis (de Vienne, 2012). Most of the genes exhibit a concordant topology with the reference tree except a small set of 'outliers'. Further investigations are currently being performed to determine possible causes for incongruities. Finally, we present preliminary results regarding the comparison of TE distribution in M. oryzae/grisea species taking into account the reference genealogy of the strains...|$|E

Understanding {{the functional}} consequences of genetic variation, {{and how it}} affects complex human disease and quantitative traits, remains a critical challenge for biomedicine. We present an analysis of RNA sequencing data from 1641 samples across 43 tissues from 175 individuals, generated {{as part of the}} pilot phase of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We describe the landscape of gene expression across tissues, catalog thousands of tissue-specific and shared regulatory expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) variants, describe complex network relationships, and identify signals from genome-wide association studies explained by eQTLs. These findings provide a systematic understanding of the cellular and biological consequences of human genetic variation and of the heterogeneity of such effects among a diverse set of human tissues...|$|E
