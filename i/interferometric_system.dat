The operational principle is based on a 7 r/ 2 differential phase shift between two modal beams occurring during their transition from near-field to far-field radiation patterns. One of the complications in fiber-optic <b>interferometric</b> <b>systems</b> for use in sensors or coherent communications is associated with the cyclic response of the photode-tector output to the optical phase shift. The sensitiv-ity of optical phase change measurements fluctuates between its maximum value and zero, depending on the phase bias that is easily influenced by environmen-tal parameters such as temperature: the so-called signal-fading problem.

But the solution has a flaw that it is sensitive to the polarisation dependent loss because the first and second paths are discriminated each other by polarisation states with the polarisation beam splitter[7].

40|$|The {{medical field}} is {{currently}} experiencing {{rapid growth in}} the area of optical diagnostics. Minimally-invasive spectroscopic and imaging modalities enable physicians to make increasingly accurate diagnoses in real time, without the cost and delay associated with traditional reliance on histopathology. We have developed an ultra-high resolution <b>interferometric</b> <b>system</b> which is well suited for clinical diagnostic applications. The <b>interferometric</b> <b>system</b> has a spatial resolution of 0. 1 nm and a temporal resolution of 3 ns. We have utilized this high resolution <b>interferometric</b> <b>system</b> in two novel minimally invasive techniques. Both techniques measure surface deformation of a target after absorption of a short laser pulse. The time dependent surface deformation {{is a function of the}} target's spatially resolved optical, thermal and mechanical properties. Therefore, accurate measurement of surface displacement can be used to extract significant diagnostic information. The first technique is termed Interferometric Photomechanical Spectroscopy (IPMS), and is used to measure effective optical absorption depth of a sample. We used IPMS to measure effective absorption depth of both diffuse and speculary reflecting targets including well characterized colored glass samples and gelatin based tissue phantoms. (cont.) phantoms. The second technique is termed Interferometric Photomechanical Tomography (IPMT), and is used to image sub-surface absorbers such as tumors or blood vessels. IPMT combines high optical contrast with low attenuation of sound propagation to localize sub-surface absorbers in highly scattering media. We have used IPMT to image sub-surface blood vessels in a phantom model and in vivo. Interferometric techniques compare favorably against diagnostic techniques which measure surface stress instead of surface displacement. This is primarily because interferometry is a non-contact epitaxial method capable of high resolution point measurements. Further, an <b>interferometric</b> <b>system</b> is easily implemented into an optical fiber setup for use in minimally- invasive catheter based procedures. by Barry P. Payne. Thesis (Ph. D.)
