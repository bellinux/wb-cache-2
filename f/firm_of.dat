40|$|Agent-based {{models of}} {{financial}} markets usually make assumptions about agent’s preferred stylized strategies. Empirical validations of these assumptions {{have not been}} performed so far on a full-market scale. Here we present a comprehensive study of the resulting strategies followed by the firms which {{are members of the}} Spanish Stock Exchange. We are able to show that they can be characterized by a resulting strategy and classified in three well- defined groups <b>of</b> <b>firms.</b> <b>Firms</b> <b>of</b> the first group have a change of inventory of the traded stock which is positively correlated with the synchronous stock return whereas <b>firms</b> <b>of</b> the second group show a negative correlation. <b>Firms</b> <b>of</b> the third group have an inventory variation uncorrelated with stock return. Firms tend to stay in the same group over the years indicating a long term specialization in the strategies controlling their inventory variation. We detect a clear asymmetry in the Granger causality between inventory variation <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> and stock return. We also detect herding in the buying and selling activity <b>of</b> <b>firms.</b> The herding properties of the two groups are markedly different and consistently observed over a four-year period <b>of</b> trading. <b>Firms</b> <b>of</b> the second group herd much more frequently than the ones of the first group. Our results can be used as an empirical basis for agent-based models of financial markets...|$|R
