5|$|A {{weekend edition}} titled Super Sloppy <b>Double</b> Dare began taping in July 1987 and premiered August 2, 1987, {{with an initial}} 26-episode run. Super Sloppy <b>Double</b> Dare {{featured}} gameplay {{identical to the original}} format; however, physical challenges and obstacles were designed to make a bigger mess. Viewers were encouraged to send in a postcard with their contact information and could win a prize if their card was selected, and a team performing a physical challenge completed the stunt successfully. Episodes of Super Sloppy <b>Double</b> Dare were taped at Unitel Studio in New York City before production moved back to WHYY-TV.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} production {{earlier in}} the month, <b>Double</b> Dare 2000 broadcast its first episode on January 22, 2000, now hosted by Jason Harris with Tiffany Phillips as announcer.

Eileen Braun, {{who worked on the}} original <b>Double</b> Dare as a production assistant and a production coordinator, was the executive producer for <b>Double</b> Dare 2000.

5|$|Although hieroglyphic text may be {{laid out}} in varying manners, {{generally}} text is arranged into <b>double</b> columns of glyph blocks. The reading order of text starts at the top left (block A1), continues to the second block in the double-column (B1), then drops down a row and starts again from the left half of the <b>double</b> column (A2), and thus continues in zig-zag fashion. Once the bottom is reached, the inscription continues from the top left of the next <b>double</b> column. Where an inscription ends in a single (unpaired) column, this final column is usually read straight downwards.|$|E
50|$|The work is scored for baritone, mezzo-soprano, {{and a large}} {{orchestra}} {{consisting of}} three flutes (1st and 2nd <b>doubling</b> piccolo; 3rd <b>doubling</b> piccolo and alto flute), three oboes (3rd <b>doubling</b> cor anglais), three clarinets (1st in B-flat and A, <b>doubling</b> E-flat clarinet); 2nd in A, <b>doubling</b> bass clarinet; 3rd in A, <b>doubling</b> bass clarinet with low C), three bassoons (2nd <b>doubling</b> contrabassoon; 3rd <b>doubling</b> contraforte or contrabassoon with low A), four horns, three trumpets (all <b>doubling</b> flugelhorn), two trombones, bass trombone, contrabass tuba, timpani (<b>doubling</b> rototoms), six to eight percussionists, harp, piano (<b>doubling</b> celesta), and strings.|$|R

5|$|Bond's {{drinking}} habits run {{throughout the}} series of books. During the course of On Her Majesty's Secret Service alone, Bond consumes forty-six drinks: Pouilly-Fuissé, Riquewihr and Marsala wines, most of a bottle of Algerian wine, some 1953 Château Mouton Rothschild claret, along with Taittinger and Krug champagnes and Babycham; for whiskies he consumes three bourbon and waters, half a pint of I.W. Harper bourbon, Jack Daniel's whiskey, two <b>double</b> bourbons on the rocks, two whisky and sodas, two neat scotches and one glass of neat whisky; vodka consumption totalled four vodka and tonics and three <b>double</b> vodka martinis; other spirits included two <b>double</b> brandies with ginger ale, a flask of Enzian Schnaps and a <b>double</b> gin: he also washed this down with four steins of German beer. Bond's alcohol intake {{does not seem to}} affect his performance.|$|E
5|$|<b>Double</b> Dares lasting {{popularity}} {{has led to}} a variety of products being made available. Pressman Toy Corporation released two traditional board games based on the show: The <b>Double</b> Dare home game was released in September 1987 and Wet 'N Wild <b>Double</b> Dare was released in March 1989. Another board game titled <b>Double</b> Dare: The Game was manufactured by Mattel in 2001. GameTek published a PC game in 1988, and a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990 based on the program. Containing facts about the show, along with trivia and activities to host a home version of the game, two editions of The <b>Double</b> Dare Game Book were released by Parachute Press in 1988 and 1989. Based on substances referenced on <b>Double</b> Dare and <b>Double</b> Dare 2000, Mattel and Jakks Pacific manufactured a series of toy slimes called Gak and Goooze.

5|$|<b>Double</b> hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel with <b>double</b> sides adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already required to have <b>double</b> bottoms. One of the advantages of the <b>double</b> hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. <b>Double</b> sides also improve a ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|E
5|$|Each round {{began with}} a toss-up {{physical}} challenge in which both teams competed, with the winning team receiving both initial control of the round, and money for their score. After the toss-up, the host began asking trivia questions of the team in control. Each correct answer earned a monetary award, and allowed the team to maintain control, while an incorrect answer, or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turned control over to the opponents. However, the team could dare their opponents to answer the question, doubling its value; in response, the opponents could <b>double</b> dare for quadruple the original value. When the team in control was challenged to a <b>double</b> dare, they had to either answer or compete in a physical challenge. An incorrect answer, or not responding within approximately five seconds on a dare or <b>double</b> dare, awarded both control and the appropriate {{amount of money to}} the team that issued it. The second round played the same as the first, with question values doubled. On <b>Double</b> Dare and Super Sloppy <b>Double</b> Dare, a question was initially worth $10. On Family <b>Double</b> Dare and <b>Double</b> Dare 2000, a question was initially worth $25.|$|E
