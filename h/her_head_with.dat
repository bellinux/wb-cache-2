5|$|Their {{marriage}} is loving {{and the birth}} of their first child helps heal the breach between Victoria and her mother, who had earlier sent a letter of support during the crisis. Nevertheless, Albert is frustrated at his initial powerlessness and Queen Adelaide advises Victoria to allow him to take on more duties. He then reorganises the running of the royal household and dismisses Conroy for mishandling funds. As Victoria's primary adviser, he now blocks the influences of Lord Melbourne and King Leopold. However, Victoria quarrels with him fiercely for going over <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> Peel in the matter of her household.|$|E
25|$|Chhinnamasta, a self-decapitated Hindu goddess, is {{depicted}} holding <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> three jets of blood spurting {{out of her}} bleeding neck, which are drunk by her severed head and two attendants.

25|$|After she assimilated many of {{the roles}} of Hathor, Isis's headdress was {{replaced}} with that of Hathor: the horns of a cow on <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>with</b> the solar disk between them, and often with her original throne symbol atop the solar disk. Sometimes she also is represented as a cow, or with a cow's head. She is often depicted with her young child, Horus (the pharaoh), with a crown, and a vulture. Occasionally she is represented as a kite flying above the body of Osiris or with the dead Osiris she works her magic {{to bring him back}} to life.|$|E

25|$|On 20 August 2001 Tiernan's {{body was}} found by Mark Bisson, who was walking his two dogs in Lindley Woods, North Yorkshire, 100 yards from where another murder victim, Yvonne Fitt, had been {{discovered}} buried in 1992. Tiernan was identified from her fingerprints on 22 August 2001, and Det. Supt. Gregg announced that the inquiry had now become a murder investigation, codenamed Operation Conifer. Tiernan's body had been wrapped inside nine green plastic bin bags secured with twine, with a black bin bag secured around <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> a leather dog collar, then placed inside a floral-patterned duvet cover.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{inception}} of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, {{there had been some}} techniques to keep people alive developed in the 18th century, both in Japan and in Europe, however {{it was not until the}} mid-20th century that James Elam and Peter Safar discovered and published the method now known as CPR. Safar conducted research on existing basic life support procedures including controlling a person’s breathing airway by tilting back his or <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> an open mouth; and using mouth-to-mouth breathing. He combined these with a procedure known as closed-chest cardiac massage to become the basic life support method of CPR.|$|E
25|$|The Viennese oyster {{position}} requires great flexibility {{from the}} woman to perform. The female lies {{on her back and}} moves her legs behind <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>with</b> the groin area being completely exposed. The male partner penetrates the vagina from the top. This is a deep penetrating position and may not be suitable for men with larger than average penis size. However, in most cases, the female will not be flexible enough to achieve this position fully, and will need to stop well before the legs are behind the head. If that is the case, the male partner can help hold the legs in a comfortable position and continue on with intercourse.|$|E

25|$|Zahau was gagged with a blue, long sleeve T-shirt {{wrapped around}} <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> the sleeves double knotted and stuffed into her mouth. There was also what {{appeared}} to be tape residue on her legs. Medics attempted to revive her, but pronounced her dead at the scene. The police initiated forensic and toxicology testing on her body as part of an autopsy to determine the cause of death. She was buried at St. Joseph's Memorial Park in St. Joseph, Missouri on July 23. Speculations of foul play began early on in the case; however, investigators were unable to find any other DNA at the scene besides Zahau's. On September 2, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department formally announced their finding that Zahau committed suicide.|$|E
25|$|Xin Zhui's {{body was}} remarkably preserved. Her skin {{was soft and}} moist, with muscles that still allowed for {{her arms and legs}} to flex at the joints. All her organs and blood vessels were also intact, with small amounts of Type A blood being found in her veins. There was hair on <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>with</b> a wig pinned with a hair clasp {{on the back of her}} head. There was skin on her face, and her eyelashes and nose hair still exist. The tympanic {{membrane}} of her left ear was intact, and her finger and toe prints were distinct. This preservation allowed doctors at Hunan Provincial Medical Institute to perform an autopsy on 14 December 1972. Much of what is known about Xin Zhui's lifestyle was derived from this and other examinations. Xin Zhui's body was soaked in an unknown liquid that was mildly acidic with some magnesium in it. More than 1,000 precious artefacts were found with Xin Zhui's body.|$|E

500|$|The video {{features}} Madonna in {{a stylized}} recording studio singing the song with back up singers. The video {{was compared to}} the music video of Madonna's single [...] "Rain" [...] (1993). Her look in the video, consists of blue-black icy hair, bright blue eyes and a long dark dress with a beaded necklace around her neck. Madonna's face was mainly shot above <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>with</b> her face looking up {{just ahead of the}} camera focus. Sometimes she looks to a video screen behind her which plays the scenes from the film, as if to take inspiration for her singing. Other times she is accompanied by her back-up singers, mainly during the chorus, and sometimes she sings alone. In front of the studio, the producers are shown deciding which part of the song should be put in lower bass.|$|E
500|$|Back in Scranton, {{the rest}} of the {{employees}} are going to be forced to work on a Saturday to record their own sales as the website's sales, which is, according to Ryan, [...] "a temporary procedure to increase the legitimacy of the website." [...] With no one eager to participate, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) decides to ask everyone to stay in the office late instead of coming in for the Saturday. They all agree to the plan, and after working until 9:00pm, they are shocked to find the parking lot gates locked. [...] Jim had forgotten to tell the security guard that they were staying late. They are unable to return to the office because Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) locked the door from the inside, and Dwight, miles away in New York, has both the spare and master keys. Jim repeatedly calls Hank the security guard (Hugh Dane). Pam accidentally injures Meredith by hitting <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> a football that was found in the parking lot. Sitting in the lobby area waiting for the security guard to arrive, the employees are clearly frustrated with Jim, and even vote by a show of hands that Andy and Angela are a better couple than Jim and Pam.|$|E

500|$|Initial {{reactions}} to Akane were mixed. Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator {{liked the way}} the first episode focused on Akane's first day {{as a police officer}} and her opinions of it. Thomas Zoth from The Fandom Post said Akane's personality is typical of those in dramas; he called her a [...] "naive waif who gets over <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> her first case". Zoth said that in later episodes, he liked the relationship Akane established with Masaoka and Ginoza, which resulted in several interesting scenes. Zoth said he grew to care about Akane {{during the first half of}} the series in [...] "a somewhat ironically 'moe' way, as she's grown as a character". In a similar review, Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network said Akane's actions in the first episode [...] " [...] her up as the clear-eyed, albeit naïve, outsider of the story, willing to look at things differently". David West from Neo noted how weak Akane's character was in early episodes due to how often Kogami did her work. Moreover, once Kogami was impressed by Akane when she requested to revive her traumatic experience to see Makishima's face, West still felt the character was underdeveloped in contrast to Kogami's comments about her growth.|$|E

Her gaze is directed neither straight ahead, nor toward the viewer, but toward a [...] "third party" [...] beyond the picture's frame. In her arms, Gallerani holds a small white-coated stoat, known as an ermine. Gallerani's dress is comparatively simple, revealing that she is not a noblewoman. Her coiffure, known as a coazone, confines her hair smoothly to <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> two bands of hair bound {{on either side of her}} face and a long plait at the back. Her hair is held in place by a fine gauze veil with a woven border of gold-wound threads, a black band, and a sheath over the plait.|$|E

In the tree, he finds three chambers filled with precious coins guarded by three monstrous dogs, [...] "one with eyes the size of teacups", who guards a vault filled with pennies, one with [...] "eyes the size of water wheels", who guards a vault filled with silver, and one with eyes [...] "the size of Round Tower", who guards a vault filled with gold. He fills his pockets with money, finds the tinderbox, {{and returns to the}} witch.

He said that she had walked past him and on impulse he had seized her from behind, tied her hands behind her back with a dog leash, covered <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> his jacket and forced her to walk to his home in nearby Cockshott Drive. He then forced her into his bedroom and onto the bed where, during a struggle, she had fallen off the bed, striking her head on the floor.
