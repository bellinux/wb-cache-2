40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Accurate {{quantification}} of radionuclides detected {{during a}} scanning survey relies on an appropriately determined scan efficiency calibration factor (SECF). Traditionally, instrument efficiency was determined from a <b>fixed</b> <b>instrument</b> to source geometry. However, {{as is often}} the case, the instrument is used in a scanning mode where the source to instrument geometry is dynamic during the observation interval. Three separate procedures were developed to determine the SECF for a 10 cm x 10 cm source passing under the centerline of a 12. 7 cm x 7. 62 cm NaI(T 1) detector. The procedures were first tested for determining the SECF from a series of static point source measurements generated by the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) code. These static efficiency values were then used to predict the SECF for scan speeds ranging from 10 cm s⁻¹ to 80 cm s⁻¹ with a one second observation interval. The investigator then used MCNP to directly determine the SECF by simulating a scan of a 10 cm x 10 cm area source for scan speeds ranging from 10 cm s⁻¹ to 80 cm s⁻¹. Comparison of the MCNP static simulation with the scan simulation showed the accuracy of the SECF prediction procedures to be within ± 5...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, an {{informed}} NMF-based SSS method {{has been proposed}} to tackle the microphone leakage problem in multichannel close-microphone recordings. The proposed method is specifically designed for a scenario in which the number of source signals is equal or less {{than the number of}} microphone signals and a single predominant source is considered for each mixture signal. As demonstrated in the evaluation stage, despite assuming instantaneous mixing and using <b>fixed</b> <b>instrument</b> models, the proposed method provides similar performance to other state-of-the-art approaches, showing the potential of NMF-based approaches in real-world applications. Moreover, the use of trained instrument models allows for a fast computation of the panning matrix and simplifies the separation stage by reducing the factorization to the estimation of instrument time-varying gains. However, these models are fixed and, therefore, the differences with respect to the spectra of the analyzed instruments in the mixture may lead to worse separation results, as seen {{in the case of the}} bassoon. Further work will be aimed at adapting the parameters of the model to the observed music scene. To address this issue, a proper initialization of the gains and the use of additional optimization constraints will be considered. This way, the parameters will only be adapted when there is high confidence that a note is active and free of interference.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of an in-situ tensometer is described along with preliminary results of x-ray line profiles from copper foils under tensile stress. The tensometer was designed and constructed on the high resolution diffraction instrument, Station 2. 3 at the synchrotron radiation source (SRS) Daresbury Laboratory, and is capable of collecting data in either symmetric or asymmetric geometry including transmission and reflection modes. Experiments were carried out using 18 J [...] Lm thick copper foil up to strain levels of 5 % using both symmetric reflection and symmetric transmission diffraction. All profiles displayed diffraction broadening and asymmetry which increased with strain. In addition, the asymmetry observed in symmetric transmission was associated with extended tails on the low angle side of the profiles, but in symmetric reflection data the opposite asymmetry was observed. In the analysis, the measured profiles were fitted using the software TOPAS, a fundamental parameters approach to profile fitting. The instrumental profile function was characterised and modelled using annealed LaB 6 powder. The diffraction broadening was then determined by refining the convolution of a Voigt function, an asymmetric exponential function and a <b>fixed</b> <b>instrument</b> function to reproduce the observed broadened profiles.

Wave set-up data are presented with corresponding hydrodynamic and morphologic observations, including nearshore currents, wave climate and bed level change obtained from <b>fixed</b> <b>instrument</b> arrays spanning an exposed low amplitude intertidal bar. Extended time series analysis is afforded through pressure records providing a greater temporal examination of the set-up trends, {{as well as the}} implications of highly energetic (storm) conditions. Under small waves (H, = 0. 27 - 0. 43 m), set-up on the seaward slope of the bar is consistently maintained, followed by clear set-down into the bar trough. Set-up gradients exhibit greatest values and mean onshore flows across the bar are present up to - 30 % water depth. With increased depth, mean offshore flows (bed return flow) prevail and set-down into the trough is reduced. The balance in onshore-directed radiation stress is not met by changes in the still water level (7) outside of the bar; however, greater agreement is found shoreward of the trough. Under energetic conditions (Hs = 0. 82 m) and subsequent bar removal, onshore flows persist in the location of the former bar beneath shallow conditions, reversing to strong offshore flows with increased Hs and h. The relevance of bar morphology in governing initial set-up and cross-shore flow response is identified, and the importance for future models of bar maintenance and migration under differing environments expressed.

40|$|Background: The {{relationship}} between normal and tangential force components (grip force - GF and load force - LF, respectively) {{acting on the}} digits-object interface during object manipulation reveals neural mechanisms involved in movement control. Here, we examined whether the feedback type provided to the participants during exertion of LF would influence GF-LF coordination and task performance. Methods. Sixteen young (24. 7 ± 3. 8 years-old) volunteers isometrically exerted continuously sinusoidal FZ (vertical component of LF) by pulling a <b>fixed</b> <b>instrumented</b> handle up and relaxing under two feedback conditions: targeting and tracking. In targeting condition, FZ exertion range was determined by horizontal lines representing the upper (10 N) and lower (1 N) targets, with frequency (0. 77 or 1. 53 Hz) dictated by a metronome. In tracking condition, a sinusoidal template set at similar frequencies and range was presented and should be superposed by the participants' exerted FZ. Task performance was assessed by absolute errors at peaks (AEPeak) and valleys (AEValley) and GF-LF coordination by GF-LF ratios, maximum cross-correlation coefficients (r max), and time lags. Results: The results revealed no effect of feedback and no feedback by frequency interaction on any variable. AE Peak and GF-LF ratio were higher and rmax lower at 1. 53 Hz than at 0. 77 Hz. Conclusion: These findings indicate {{that the type of}} feedback does not influence task performance and GF-LF coordination. Therefore, we recommend the use of tracking tasks when assessing GF-LF coordination during isometric LF exertion in externally <b>fixed</b> <b>instrumented</b> handles because they are easier to understand and provide additional indices (e. g., RMSE) of voluntary force control. © 2013 Pedão et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Modern hyperspectral imaging {{systems are}} able to acquire far more data than can be downlinked from a spacecraft. Onboard data {{compression}} helps to alleviate this problem, but requires a system capable of power efficiency and high throughput. Software solutions have limited throughput performance and are power-hungry. Dedicated hardware solutions can provide both high throughput and power efficiency, while taking the load off of the main processor. Thus a hardware compression system was developed. The implementation uses a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The implementation {{is based on the}} fast lossless (FL) compression algorithm reported in Fast Lossless Compression of Multispectral-Image Data (NPO- 42517), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 30, No. 8 (August 2006), page 26, which achieves excellent compression performance and has low complexity. This algorithm performs predictive compression using an adaptive filtering method, and uses adaptive Golomb coding. The implementation also packetizes the coded data. The FL algorithm is well suited for implementation in hardware. In the FPGA implementation, one sample is compressed every clock cycle, which makes for a fast and practical realtime solution for space applications. Benefits of this implementation are: 1) The underlying algorithm achieves a combination of low complexity and compression effectiveness that exceeds that of techniques currently in use. 2) The algorithm requires no training data or other specific information {{about the nature of the}} spectral bands for a <b>fixed</b> <b>instrument</b> dynamic range. 3) Hardware acceleration provides a throughput improvement of 10 to 100 times vs. the software implementation.

The crawler “Wally” is deployed at the Barkley Canyon methane hydrates site (NE Pacific, Canada; ~ 890 m depth) and connected to the Ocean Networks Canada NEPTUNE cabled observatory network (ONC; www. oceannetworks. ca). Here we present the environmental and biological datasets obtained from Wally instruments and cameras, during the first deployment phase (September 2010 to January 2015), {{as well as new}} features and preliminary results obtained since it was re-deployed (May 2016 – present). In addition to data provided by the standard payload of the crawler (i. e. ADCP, CTD, methane sensor, turbidity sensor and fluorometer), the hydrates community was video-monitored at different frequencies and timespans. Photomosaics were generated at two distinct locations, in order to map chemosynthetic bacterial mats and vesicomyid clam colonies covering the ~ 2 - 3 m high hydrate mounds, and document their temporal dynamics. The crawler followed the development of a deep-sea shell taphonomic experiment aiming to quantify biogenic carbon fluxes at the hydrates environment. The composition and diel activity patterns of the hydrates megafaunal community were studied with the use of linear video-transects conducted from February 2013 to April 2014. Since the summer of 2016, video-frames recorded at different locations of the site are analyzed for a biodiversity study and photomosaicing of the hydrate mounds continues, with 3 D modelling of the mound structures also available as a new feature of the crawler deployed in May 2016. All data are archived in real-time and can be accessed online on the Ocean Networks Canada database.

40|$|The EUCLID space {{mission is}} an ambitious project for {{measuring}} the statistical properties of the universe with an error bellow 1 % up to redshift 2, from a survey of 1 billion of galaxies (100 thousand with a spectra). Because {{of the size of}} the mission, the flow down from the scientific requirements to the technical needs of the telescope, the instruments and the ground infrastructures, is extremely complex. To check the science requirements at every step of the mission we need some robust simulation tools. In the framework of EUCLID simulations, the CPPM has took in charge the prototype of the simulator of the NISP spectrometer. We have provided to the community a prototype called TIPS (TIPS Is a Pixel Simulator). TIPS is a simulation tool based on aXeSIM (Kuemmel et al., 2007 and 2009) which produces the expected raw images of the NISP focal plan. The talk will focus on two use cases of TIPS, the prediction of the mission performances and the global analysis of the mission data. The purpose of the performance analysis is to check if a given mission implementation allows to achieve the mission requirements. The ultimate requirements that must be validated are the science goals but in our case, for cosmology, the simulation size needed is typically 10000 deg². We will not be able to run the full end to end simulation of the mission every time something is modified in the telescope. That's why we derived the performances in two sub-levels. The instrument performances measure the capabilities of the instrument alone and could be done with the simulation of one field of view (0. 5 deg²). The survey performances estimate the efficiency of the redshift measurement. The typical scale of simulation in this case is 10 deg². TIPS is already used in production to measure the instrument performances of the NISP spectrometer. The method will be illustrated with our results on the impact of the PSF distribution (Jullo et al., 2012) and the cosmic rays (Ealet et al., 2013). The second use case of TIPS is the most challenging. We want to use the simulation to fit the reality in comparing the simulated images with the real ones. As in the performance analysis, we split this use case into three levels. At the instrument level, we would like to measure the calibration. Using a known source (calibration LED, standard stars [...] .), we could iterate on the instrument model parameters and simulate the calibration data up to be able to reproduce the real images. At the survey level, we would like to measure the sources. This time using a <b>fixed</b> <b>instrument</b> model, we could reconstruct the source spectra and/or adjust some parameters like the redshift. At the cosmology level, we could imagine applying the same principle to fit the cosmological parameters but, at this time, it will not be feasible because of the huge computational needs that it implies.
