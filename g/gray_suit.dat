25|$|Guards {{initially}} {{laughed at}} the claims of ghosts by inmates but as time progressed some {{were reported to have}} experienced unusual activity themselves, including feeling cold spots, unseen fingers on the back of their neck, and crying in the night. The first Warden of Alcatraz, James A. Johnston, was reputed to have heard a woman sobbing while conducting tour of the prison. Occupants of the prison reported seeing prisoners from the early military prison in 19th century garb walking the corridors in A-Block which would disappear when approached by the guards, and one member of staff reputedly saw a gang of Native American prisoners marching around in a circle before vanishing. Phantom gunfire, cannon blasts and fire alarms going off on their own accord have all been reported. The Warden's House, now a burnt out shell since the Occupation of Alcatraz, is also reputed to be haunted; {{during the time of the}} penitentiary, several guards reported seeing the spectre of a man with mutton-chop sideburns during a party wearing a <b>gray</b> <b>suit</b> and brimmed cap, leaving the room icy cold and extinguishing the fire in the Ben Franklin stove. A phantom lighthouse has also been said to have emerged from the fog of San Francisco bay.|$|E

500|$|Lopez {{arrived on}} the red carpet of the 42nd Grammy Awards in the company of then-boyfriend Sean Combs; he was dressed in a <b>gray</b> <b>suit.</b> Although the fashion house Versace had only loaned the dress, it {{subsequently}} decided to give it away as a token of gratitude for the enormous publicity generated. The singer immediately monopolized the attention and curiosity of the public and photographers at the event. Actor David Duchovny appeared on stage with Lopez to present the award for Best R Album and declared to the audience, [...] "This {{is the first time in}} five or six years that I'm sure that nobody is looking at me", eliciting laughter from the audience and Lopez.|$|E
500|$|The man {{is again}} {{lying on the}} bed, now in a <b>gray</b> <b>suit.</b> Hearing a knock, he starts the song playing again before {{opening the door to}} a woman (Natalie Portman). After staring at him for several seconds, the woman breaks the silence by asking what music is playing. Receiving no response, she steps into the room and {{presents}} the man with a bouquet of flowers. When she moves to kiss him on the mouth, he turns his head away and they embrace instead. He closes the door and asks how she found him; she replies that it [...] "wasn't actually that hard". She moves around the room browsing through his possessions, brushes her teeth with his toothbrush and declines to take the bath he had run for her.|$|E
500|$|Kahn {{also said}} that instead of taking the song's lyrics and being [...] "pretentious" [...] about it, {{he wanted to show}} the {{audience}} exactly what Brown was singing about, commenting, [...] "What if we just got ambitious and demonstrated the lyrics? The trick is {{to do it in a}} creative way. Let's try to display the lyrics and the feeling of the dance at the same time." [...] On October 2009, Brown released screencaps for the video, coincidentally the same day Rihanna released her video for [...] "Russian Roulette". The photos showed several scenes, including Brown in the middle of a squadron of black storm troopers, Brown in a <b>gray</b> <b>suit,</b> and him giving a karate kick in mid-air. Another was also of Brown, Wayne and Swizz Beatz standing confidently against a white backdrop.|$|E

For the performance, Bieber covered Busta Rhyme's verse.

500|$|On June 26, 2011, Brown {{performed}} [...] "She Ain't You" [...] {{along with}} [...] "Look at Me Now" [...] and [...] "Paper, Scissors, Rock" [...] at the 2011 BET Awards.

500|$|The {{character}} of [...] "Pee-wee Herman" [...] originated during a 1978 improvisation exercise with The Groundlings, where Reubens {{came up with}} the idea of a man who wanted to be a comic but was so inept at telling jokes that it was obvious to the audience that he would never make it. Fellow Groundling Phil Hartman would afterwards help Reubens develop the character while another Groundling, John Paragon, would help write the show. Despite having been compared to other famous characters, such as Hergé's Tintin and Collodi's Pinocchio, Reubens says that there is no specific source for [...] "Pee-wee" [...] but rather a collection of ideas. Pee-wee's voice originated in 1970 when Reubens appeared in a production of Life with Father, where he was cast as one of the most obnoxious characters in the play, for which Reubens adopted a cartoon-like way of speaking that would become Pee-wee's. Pee-wee's name resulted from a one-inch Pee Wee brand harmonica Reubens had as a child, and Herman was the surname of an energetic boy Reubens knew from his youth. The first small <b>gray</b> <b>suit</b> Pee-wee ever wore had been handmade for director and founder of the Groundlings Gary Austin, who passed it on to Reubens, while [...] "someone" [...] handed him the [...] "little kid bow tie" [...] before a show.|$|E

The Beast was portrayed with a “more traditional motion capture puppeteering for {{the body and the}} physical orientation", where Stevens was [...] "in a forty-pound <b>gray</b> <b>suit</b> on stilts for much of the film". The facial capture for the Beast was done separately order to [...] "communicate the subtleties of the human face" [...] and [...] " [...] thought that occurs to him" [...] which gets [...] "through [...] the eyes, which are the last human element in the Beast.” ...|$|E
2500|$|IBM's {{culture has}} evolved {{significantly}} over its century of operations. In its early days, a dark (or <b>gray)</b> <b>suit,</b> white shirt, and a [...] "sincere" [...] tie constituted the public uniform for IBM employees. During IBM's management {{transformation in the}} 1990s, CEO Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. relaxed these codes, normalizing the dress and behavior of IBM employees. The company's culture has also given to different plays on the company acronym (IBM), with some saying is stands for [...] "I've Been Moved" [...] due to relocations and layoffs, others saying it stands for [...] "I'm By Myself" [...] pursuant to a prevalent work-from-anywhere norm, and others saying it stands for [...] "I'm Being Mentored" [...] due to the company's open door policy and encouragement for mentoring at all levels. In terms of labor relations, the company has traditionally resisted labor union organizing, although unions represent some IBM workers outside the United States. In Japan, IBM employees also have an American football team complete with pro stadium, cheerleaders and televised games, competing in the Japanese X-League as the [...] "Big Blue".|$|E
2500|$|Biff Jones hired Tom Stidham {{to coach}} the Oklahoma line in 1935. When Jones left in 1937, Stidham became the head coach. As Oklahoma's 10th {{football}} coach, Stidham posted OU's most successful record of all time against Texas with only one loss in four years. His greatest triumph while at OU was his 23-0 demolition in 1939 of Coach Pappy Waldorf's Northwestern team that was picked to win the national championship. Stidham was the first Oklahoma coach to defeat Waldorf (both Adrian [...] "Ad" [...] Lindsey and Lewie Hardage had also tried). Stidham's 1938 Sooners were undefeated {{in the regular season}} and were ranked No. 4 in the AP poll, but lost in the Sooners' first bowl appearance, the Orange Bowl, to Tennessee. After OU's hard-fought loss to the Volunteers, Stidham went back to his hotel room, took off the <b>gray</b> <b>suit</b> he had worn triumphantly in the 10 games Oklahoma had won and dropped it out the fifth-floor window. In his time, Stidham placed more of his Oklahoma players into the pros than any other coach. In 1940, 17 Sooners started in pro football and 10 stayed all season.|$|E

50|$|The Man in the <b>Gray</b> Flannel <b>Suit</b> II {{was not a}} {{commercial}} success. Many fans felt that the sequel did {{not live up to}} the expectations set by the original. The novel marked Wilson's last major effort in fiction writing. (His autobiographical memoir What Shall We Wear to The Party?: The Man In The <b>Gray</b> Flannel <b>Suit,</b> Twenty Years Before & After, published in 1976, also marked Wilson's last non-fiction effort.) After early success with The Man in the <b>Gray</b> Flannel <b>Suit</b> and A Summer Place in the 1950s — both of which became best-sellers and were made into profitable motion pictures — Wilson crafted ten more books, but none approached those early heights of popularity.|$|R
