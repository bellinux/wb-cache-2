500|$|The {{original}} {{script was}} significantly {{longer than the}} one used during filming, and featured a series of lengthy monologues; it was edited on-set by the cast and script supervisor, who found much of the dialogue incomprehensible. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, one anonymous cast member commented that the script contained [...] "stuff that was just unsayable. I know it's hard to <b>imagine</b> <b>there</b> was stuff that was worse. But there was". Sestero mentions that Wiseau was adamant characters say their lines {{the way they were}} written, but that several cast members managed to slip in ad libs that ended up in the final cut of the film.|$|E
500|$|Henry married Louise de Lorraine-Vaudémont in February 1575, {{two days}} after his coronation. His choice thwarted Catherine's plans for a {{political}} marriage to a foreign princess. Rumours of Henry's inability to produce children were by that time in wide circulation. The papal nuncio Salviati observed, [...] "it is only with difficulty that we can <b>imagine</b> <b>there</b> will be offspring... physicians and {{those who know him}} well say that he has an extremely weak constitution and will not live long." [...] As time passed and the likelihood of children from the marriage receded, Catherine's youngest son, Francis, Duke of Alençon, known as [...] "Monsieur", played upon his role as heir to the throne, repeatedly exploiting the anarchy of the civil wars, which were by now as much about noble power struggles as religion. Catherine did all in her power to bring Francis back into the fold. On one occasion, in March 1578, she lectured him for six hours about his dangerously subversive behaviour.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Holmes from Destructoid {{questioned}} {{the controversy over}} the decision by stating [...] "While there are surely plenty of folks who adore seeing their screen filled with frilly thong shots, I <b>imagine</b> <b>there</b> may be even more players out there who'd find the sudden prioritization of arse in their fighting games to be little out of place." [...] Chris Carter at Destructoid commented [...] "It's still a bit weird that something this goofy was removed, especially with the design Laura has in general," [...] and noted that a character like Necalli is [...] "probably far more harmful" [...] for children's eyes. In another article by Destructoid, Carter stated [...] "It's such a weird thing to me, because R. Mika's butt is still very visible, she just doesn't lightly tap it a few times per match." [...] Likewise, ND Medina at iDigitalTimes expressed confusion over the change, noting that her full butt was still being exposed. The butt slap was later restored as a mod for the PC version, albeit in a different pose.|$|E

500|$|In August 1950, the {{government}} called for Second World War veterans {{to serve in}} the Korea War as part of the specially raised 'K' Force. Saunders volunteered and returned to the Army as a lieutenant. After training at Puckapunyal, Victoria, and in Japan, he arrived in Korea in November 1950. He served with the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3RAR), initially as a platoon commander in A Company. In February 1951, he took charge of ACompany when its commander was wounded; he was subsequently given command of CCompany. Promoted to captain, Saunders led CCompany during the Battle of Kapyong in April, when 3RAR and a Canadian battalion held off a Chinese division north-east of the South Korean capital Seoul. [...] Frustrated by the conduct of the war prior to Kapyong, he afterwards recorded that, [...] "At last I felt like an Anzac and I <b>imagine</b> <b>there</b> were 600 others like me". The 3rd Battalion was awarded a US Presidential Unit Citation for its part in the action. Saunders himself was recommended for a decoration but turned it down. Leading a Vickers machine gun platoon at the Battle of Maryang San in October, he reportedly shared the following exchange with a fellow 3RAR officer: as they surveyed the forbidding mountain before them, Saunders' companion remarked, [...] "No country for white men", to which Saunders replied, [...] "It's no country for black men, either". He returned to Australia in November 1951.|$|E
2500|$|Sheffield's batting swing was an {{exemplary}} mix of savage speed and pinpoint control. [...] Despite his high home run total, Sheffield only topped 80 strikeouts twice in 22 seasons, while finishing his career among the all-time top 20 walks leaders. [...] Because of his combination of skill, sportswriter Joe Posnanski wrote, [...] "I can’t <b>imagine</b> <b>there</b> {{has ever been}} a scarier hitter to face." [...] His first manager Tom Trebelhorn said, [...] "Gary can turn on a 38-caliber bullet.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Tomkinson {{thinks the}} impure motives behind {{the idea of}} God being pure spirit are only too obvious. He says it was {{originally}} a pagan form of self-flattery to <b>imagine</b> <b>there</b> {{was a little bit}} of God in us all. He traces its history from Nimrod, through Pythagoras to Pliny the Elder and tells how they loved to commission statues of themselves to impress others. Scriptural literalists (from Augustine to Richard Baxter) fall into a similar error of human imaginings. Yet there was always an underground stream of the truth. He cites the followers of Sabilis which we would probably label Sabellianism. Also the Athrapamorphets. These truth-sayers were persecuted by the dominant culture due to the take-over of the church by the state and because the Apostles [...] "preached the faith in a personal God, but in that they clothed it within the appellation of several titles, it appeared more intricate and mysterious" [...] than it really was.|$|E

2500|$|Despite Graham's {{announcement}} that the Fillmore West gig was Big Brother's last concert with Joplin, the band—with Joplin still as lead vocalist—toured the United States that fall. Reflecting Joplin's crossover appeal, two October 1968 performances at a roller rink in Alexandria, Virginia, were reviewed by John Segraves {{of the conservative}} Washington Evening Star {{at a time when}} the Washington metropolitan area's hard rock scene was in its infancy. An opera buff at the time, he wrote, [...] "Miss Joplin, in her early 20s, has been for the last year or two the vocalist with Big Brother and the Holding Company, a rock quintet of superior electric expertise. Shortly she will be merely Janis Joplin, a vocalist singing folk rock on her first album as a single. Whatever she does and whatever she sings she'll do it well because her vocal talents are boundless. This is the way she came across in a huge, high-ceilinged roller skating rink without any acoustics but, thankfully a good enough sound system behind her. In a proper room, I would <b>imagine</b> <b>there</b> would be no adjectives to describe her." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Imagine</b> <b>There’s</b> No Hunger is {{a global}} {{campaign}} inspired by John Lennon’s vision of a world at peace and free from hunger. The campaign works with Hard Rock International and Yoko Ono Lennon to help children throughout the world realize their own power to change their lives. Through <b>Imagine</b> <b>There’s</b> No Hunger, WhyHunger hopes to inspire children to engage {{themselves and their families}} as active participants in growing food in their school yard, establishing community farms and developing sustainable agroecological production methods. WhyHunger is ensuring that children have lasting access to nutritious food via long-term, sustainable solutions that rebuild local food and farm economies. Through <b>Imagine</b> <b>There’s</b> No Hunger, more than $5.6 million has been raised to fight childhood hunger and more than 7.2 million meals have been provided for children in need from 22 countries around the world. Each year, the campaign is highlighted in November and December, raising funds and awareness via celebrity events, the sale of signature John Lennon “Imagine” merchandise at Hard Rock properties across the globe and online action tied to the hashtag #ImagineNoHunger.|$|R
