5|$|As Mulder—in Fletcher's body—is dragged {{away by the}} soldiers, Scully {{begins to}} {{question}} whether what Mulder {{told her about the}} body-swap was true. Fletcher—in Mulder's body—approaches Scully and apologizes for telling Kersh and she feigns acceptance of it. After being reprimanded, Fletcher arranges a dinner date with Scully at Mulder's apartment. Meanwhile, Mulder is confined in a cell next to the mind-switched Lana Chee. Military police arrive and take Mulder to a meeting with General Wegman, Grodin and Smoodge. They believe that Mulder-as-Fletcher was trying to defraud the FBI, not help them. Mulder bluffs his way through the meeting, and claims that the real proof is safe and that he did not tell them about the scheme because he did not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could trust his colleagues, thinking any one of them could be the source of the leak. Mulder returns to Fletcher's house and tells Joanne Fletcher that he is Agent Fox Mulder, but Joanne thinks her husband must be undergoing a mid-life crisis.|$|E
5|$|On the May 24 {{episode of}} Raw, Bischoff lifted Michaels' suspension, after Triple H pleaded that Michaels be reinstated. On the same night, Michaels confronted Bischoff wanting to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was {{scheduled}} in a match with Triple H at Bad Blood. Bischoff assured Michaels, but Triple H attacked Michaels from behind, after Michaels attacked Triple H outside the arena's parking lot. Bischoff gave orders to Raw superstars to attack Triple H and Michaels, if seen fighting. The roster tried breaking the fight up, but were unsuccessful in doing so. The {{result of the}} fight gave Bischoff the authority to schedule a Hell in a Cell match between Triple H and Michaels at Bad Blood. At Bad Blood, Triple H defeated Michaels by pinfall after executing two Pedigrees.|$|E

25|$|In 1809, Louis Poinsot rediscovered Kepler's figures, by {{assembling}} star pentagons {{around each}} vertex. He also assembled convex polygons around star vertices to discover two more regular stars, the great icosahedron and great dodecahedron. Some people call these two the Poinsot polyhedra.

25|$|A few {{references}} to men changing into wolves {{are found in}} Ancient Greek literature and mythology. Herodotus, in his Histories, wrote that the Neuri, a tribe he places to the north-east of Scythia, were all transformed into wolves once every year for several days, and then changed back to their human shape. In the second century BC, the Greek geographer Pausanias related the story of Lycaon, who {{was transformed into a}} wolf because he had ritually murdered a child. In accounts by the Bibliotheca (3.8.1) and Ovid (Metamorphoses I.219-239), Lycaon serves human flesh to Zeus, wanting to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is really a god. Lycaon's transformation, therefore, is punishment for a crime, considered variously as murder, cannibalism, and impiety.|$|E
25|$|One {{day after}} school, {{a young girl}} named Kilala Reno stumbles across a boy {{sleeping}} in her yard. After thinking to herself {{he looks like a}} Prince, she tries to kiss him, thinking it will wake him up, just like a kiss wakes up Sleeping Beauty. He does wake but only to fall back asleep again. Kilala then carries him inside her house and watches over him sleeping as she wonders who he is and where he came from. As she's folding his coat, a small tiara falls out, which she tries on. To her surprise, she feels just like one of the Disney Princesses. Then, Rei wakes up and accuses her of stealing the tiara. She calls him the Thief instead, questioning how she would <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't steal it first. Rei's servant, Valdou, runs in and unintentionally breaks up the fight.|$|E

25|$|Without Kendall, Reese and Bianca {{exchange}} wedding vows on February 12, 2009. Ryan, however, {{has called}} off his wedding with Greenlee after seeing Zach and Reese kiss. He tells Greenlee {{that he knows}} Zach and Reese have been sleeping together and {{that he does not}} want to be married next to them, but promises her that he will give her the wedding of her dreams. Greenlee then tries to get in touch with Zach; she wants to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has really been having an affair with Reese. When Greenlee cannot get in touch with Zach, she drives off on her motorcycle in search of him. Also on the road are Zach and Kendall in a car arguing. Kendall ends up in the wrong lane and nearly hits Greenlee. Both try to swerve out of the other's way, leaving Greenlee to drive off the road. When Greenlee's body is not found, she is presumed dead. Reese, Bianca and others soon find out about Greenlee being missing. Ryan tells Bianca that Zach and Reese have been engaging in a sexual relationship with each other. Bianca goes to Reese to tell her that their relationship and marriage is over. She later sends Reese annulment papers, and returns to Paris with Miranda and Gabrielle.|$|E
25|$|Around noon on July 23, 1968, a {{call was}} made to the Cleveland Police {{reporting}} an abandoned vehicle on Beulah Avenue between E. 123rd Street and Lakeview Road. The location was just a block north of Evans' home (at the intersection of Auburndale Avenue and Lakeview). The vehicle was ticketed at 1:25 PM, but a tow truck did not arrive until dusk. It parked {{on the north side}} of Beulah Avenue near the intersection with Lakeview Road. According to tow truck worker William McMillan, the truck backed up to the abandoned car, and then McMillan got out. He was checking the license plate of the automobile a few moments later when a man with a shotgun standing at the corner of Beulah and Auburndale shot him in the back. An official chronology later placed the attack on McMillan at 8:25 PM. Another man hiding in the bushes near the front of the truck fired, and shot McMillan in the side. McMillan's coworker, still in the truck, radioed for help at 8:28 PM. According to McMillan, Ahmed Evans—armed with a carbine—walked on the sidewalk across the street and demanded to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was stealing cars. McMillan stood and said he had no weapons. He ran toward and then north up E. 123rd Street, and Evans shot him in the right side. An African American woman on E. 123rd Street gave refuge to McMillan.|$|E

500|$|John Neville {{has stated}} that he was {{originally}} hired for just two episodes of the series, but that his character [...] "was regularly brought back, because the audience simply doesn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> stands for good or evil". Series creator Chris Carter has described the character {{in terms of his}} relationship with The Smoking Man, noting that the two characters can be seen as [...] "differing in approach, differing in philosophy and differing in personality". Writer Frank Spotnitz has described the Well-Manicured Man as [...] "sort of the white knight to the Cigarette-Smoking Man's black knight in this chess game that we were playing".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of John Marston {{was developed to}} be a [...] "family man". The team developed him as a nuanced character, {{as opposed to a}} straightforward hero or villain, in order to provide an interesting experience. Wiethoff considered Marston to be very determined about his goals. [...] "He was a man about things," [...] Wiethoff remarked. Technical director Ted Carson felt that Marston became interesting due to the combination of cynicism and realism. Wiethoff felt that Marston was aware that his past actions were [...] "wrong", resulting in his attempt to abandon his former life. He stated that Marston's early decisions in his life were a direct result of his need for acceptance. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew that what he was doing was wrong or not," [...] Wiethoff said.|$|E

Later, Locke (Terry O'Quinn) confronts the prisoner, demanding to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> let himself be caught, thinking {{it might have been}} to find the Swan. [...] "Henry", however, calls the hatch a [...] "joke", saying that during the lockdown, he never entered the numbers into the computer or pushed the button; he simply stood there, and watched the timer's numbers turn to red hieroglyphs before they reset back on their own. Locke, however, replies angrily that Henry is lying, but he replies that he's [...] "done lying".|$|E

And he wouldn't send me an awful one anyway. But I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> will come up with another one.

500|$|Toivonen {{was known}} as a {{competitive}} driver both on loose (gravel, dirt, sand, snow and ice) and tarmac surfaces, and he found it difficult to choose between circuit racing and rallying. After becoming a rally driver, he still competed in some circuit racing events, successfully in two World Sportscar Championship events and also in a few races for Eddie Jordan's British Formula Three Championship team. Jordan called Toivonen's performances [...] "incredible" [...] and compared him to Ayrton Senna. After Toivonen's death, Jordan weighed in on his chances in Formula One: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would have become a champion in Formula One.

This session produced three songs, including [...] "I Don't Give A", [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] and [...] "Turn Up the Radio", the last two later becoming official singles off the album. According to the producer, few days after he had finished the composition, Madonna completed writing the lyrics of [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] Solveig understood that the lyrics were probable references towards Madonna's life and thus received coverage in the press.

500|$|After closing {{addresses}} from Kenealy and Hawkins, Cockburn began summing-up on 29 January 1874. His {{speech was}} prefaced by a severe denunciation of Kenealy's conduct, [...] "the longest, severest and best merited rebuke ever administered from the Bench {{to a member}} of the bar" [...] according to the trial's chronicler John Morse. The tone of the summing-up was partisan, frequently drawing the jury's attention to the Claimant's [...] "gross and astonishing ignorance" [...] of things he would certainly <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were Roger Tichborne. Cockburn rejected the Claimant's version of the sealed package contents and all imputations against Katherine Doughty's honour. Of Cockburn's peroration, Morse remarked that [...] "never was a more resolute determination manifested [...] to control the result". While much of the press applauded Cockburn's forthrightness, [...] his summing-up was also criticised as [...] "a Niagara of condemnation" [...] rather than an impartial review.|$|E
500|$|The {{moment that}} Cupid and Psyche are {{revealed}} {{is an example}} of [...] "Keatsian intensity" [...] as they are neither in a state of separation nor are they united; they exist in a state somewhere in between in a similar manner to the figures depicted in Keats's [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn". The narrator's ability to witness the union is unique to Keats's version of the Psyche myth because the lovers in the original story were covered in darkness. However, the narrator questions if he was able to see them at all or if he was dreaming. This inability of the narrator to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was awake is a theme that appears in many of Keats's odes that followed, including [...] "Ode on Indolence", [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn", and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". Regardless of the narrator's state of consciousness, he is able to relate himself to Cupid as he believes himself to be in love with Psyche, representing the mind.|$|E

In an October 2009 interview, David Duchovny likewise said he wanted to do a 2012 X-Files movie, but did not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would get the chance. Anderson stated in August 2012 that a third X-Files film is [...] "looking pretty good". As of July 2013, Fox had not approved the movie, although Carter, Spotnitz, Duchovny and Anderson expressed interest. At the New York Comic Con held October 10–13, 2013, Duchovny and Anderson reaffirmed that they and Carter are interested in making a third film, with Anderson saying “If it takes fan encouragement to get Fox interested in that, then I guess that's what it would be.” ...|$|E
