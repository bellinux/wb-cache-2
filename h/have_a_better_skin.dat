40|$|A higher milking frequency, as a {{consequence}} of milking with an automated milking system, incorporates a threat to teat condition. To study the effect of transition from conventional to automated milking on teat skin and teat end condition, 40 lactating Holstein-Friesian cows and heifers from a high yielding dairy herd were randomly allocated to either a conventional or an automated milking system group. In the latter group, automated milking was initiated during the study period, while conventional milking was continued in the control group. Teat skin and teat end condition were evaluated weekly on quarter level for all animals from 5 wk before until 8 wk after transition. A high emollient iodine teat dip was used on all cows during the study period. Teat skin condition of the animals in the automated milking system group was consistent from before and during milking with the automated milking system. Rear teats <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>skin</b> and end condition than front teats. Evolution of teat end condition over time between the automated and conventional milking groups was not statistically different. Heifers, however, seemed to be more sensitive to the change than multiparous cows, as their teat end condition slightly decreased.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the difference of learning achievement in Mathematics on the learning of Cubes and Cuboids in each learning model viewed from the spatial abilities and the cognitive styles. This research used the quasi experimental research with the factorial design of 3 x 3 x 2.
