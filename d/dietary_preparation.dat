40|$|After {{processing}} of citrus fruits (e. g. lemon, orange, grapefruit, mandarin) for juice and essential oils production, approximately 50 % {{of the original}} fruit mass is left as waste material. Citrus crops processing by-products are valuable components as they contain nutrients such as pectins, saccharides, carotenoids, some vitamins, minerals, polyphenols and substances with antioxidant activity. Utilisation of these kind of side products in the recipe of various cereal product led to enhancement of final product nutritional value and better sensory attributes as well as improvement of product functional properties. In this work was studied the effect of orange and mandarin dietary fibre application at level 5 and 10 % (w/w) in tarhana preparation and the influence on tarhana fermentation process. Chemical analysis showed, that <b>dietary</b> fibre <b>preparations</b> reached higher concentration of ash, fat and total dietary fibre compared to wheat flour. Wheat flour exhibited higher moisture content and protein concentration than citrus <b>dietary</b> fibre <b>preparations.</b> Orange and mandarin <b>dietary</b> fibre <b>preparations</b> showed higher values of water and oil absorption capacity, swelling capacity and least gellation concentration compared to wheat flour. Application of fruit <b>dietary</b> fibre <b>preparations</b> to tarhana recipe caused a rapid decrease in pH from 4. 70 - 5. 02 to values 4. 31 - 4. 51 during fermentation process.

After two-dimensional electrophoresis, identities of the protein components (globulin subunits and their breakdown products) were established by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. The soy concentrates (Cholsoy/Croksoy), which were used in most of the Italian and Swiss studies in which reductions in cholesterolemia occurred, exhibited a predominance of breakdown products of the 7 S globulin and mainly intact 11 S globulin subunits. Soy isolates used in the United States (SUPRO) showed none of the major components corresponding to 7 S globulin subunits; only some of the light chains of 11 S were intact, and heavy chains of 11 S also were fragmented. Ethanol- and nonethanol-treated SUPRO products showed considerable variability in their isoflavone concentrations and there seemed to be differential protein recoveries due to ethanol processing. These findings indicate differences in the protein composition of soy products used in clinical studies.

30|$|Limitations of {{the present}} study include a small sample size and {{retrospective}} design. Only 9 patients were diagnosed histologically, while none of those with cardiac sarcoidosis were diagnosed histologically by endomyocardial biopsy. Generally, endomyocardial biopsy shows lower sensitivity due to the heterogeneous distribution of the noncaseating granulomas that are characteristic of the disease. Given the limited sensitivity of myocardial biopsy, the revised guidelines 2006 [27], 2015 [32], and 2016 [33] have been used as the diagnostic standard. An important limitation of this study is the lack of significant <b>dietary</b> <b>preparation</b> with high-fat and low-carbohydrate meals prior to the 18 F-FDG PET studies. Further studies to compare the 18 F-FLT PET and 18 F-FDG PET with such a <b>dietary</b> <b>preparation</b> will be needed and are currently underway. Unfortunately, in the present study, no data on whole-body scanning were available. Teirstein et al. reported that whole-body scan with 18 F-FDG PET was particularly useful for detecting unsuspected extra-thoracic sarcoidosis [42]. They concluded that whole-body 18 F-FDG PET was useful mainly in the detection of occult sites for biopsy and in the assessment of the presence of residual activity in patients with fibrotic pulmonary sarcoidosis, which may help to decide whether to continue or cease steroid therapy [42]. We did not compare PET imaging and myocardial perfusion imaging. Although 18 F-FLT PET/CT could detect cardiac and extra-cardiac thoracic sarcoidosis as well as 18 F-FDG PET/CT, uptake of 18 F-FLT in lesions was significantly lower than that of 18 F-FDG. The lower level of uptake probably increases the detection limit, making it more difficult to visualize lesions. Pathology findings seen in sarcoidosis range from inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, noncaseating granuloma formation, and fibrotic changes to scarring [43]. Of these, 18 F-FDG PET has limited ability to depict fibrous regions [24]. To date, no study has reported this issue using 18 F-FLT PET. The combined use of 18 F-FDG, 18 F-FLT, other PET tracers, and other imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging might be helpful in the diagnosis and staging of cardiac sarcoidosis. Additional large prospective studies are needed to determine the clinical usefulness of 18 F-FLT PET/CT in patients with sarcoidosis.|$|E

For the intravenous infusion, [1 - 13 C]glucose with an enrichment level of 99 % was employed. The C 1 signals of alpha- and beta-glucose could be detected in the human liver already after an infusion period of 8 min. However, an increase in the glycogen signal was observed only after a prolonged infusion of about 60 min. Changes in the glycogen signal correlated well with the time course of insulin and glucagon during the measurement. Experiments showed also that liver glycogen formation in man can be followed noninvasively by 13 C-MRS using nonlabeled glucose or [1 - 13 C]glucose with a low level of enrichment (6. 6 %). The use of nonlabeled glucose may therefore simplify the quantitation of net liver glycogen synthesis since it can be based directly on changes in the natural abundance 13 C MRS glycogen signal, avoiding label dilution through the various metabolic pathways of glucose. The glucose uptake, estimated from the increase in the glycogen signal, was consistent with findings from more complex and invasive studies of glucose uptake in the liver.

All the above <b>dietary</b> <b>preparations</b> were made every week and supplemented for 13 consecutive weeks. Plasma lipid profile including total cholesterol, triglycerides (TC), Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) were estimated. Total cholesterol and TC were estimated in liver, heart and kidney tissues. The high cholesterol-diet caused significant increase in body and organs (liver and kidney) weights as compared to controls. Dates-diet, significantly reduced the body and liver weight that increased by the high cholesterol-diet. Plasma lipids were significantly elevated by high cholesterol-diet supplementation and this increase was significantly decreased by the dates-diet.

30|$|Cardiac fluorine- 18 {{fluorodeoxyglucose}} (18 F-FDG) positron {{emission tomography}} (PET) is increasingly used for detecting cardiac involvement and assessing the presence and severity of myocardial inflammation in sarcoidosis [1]. Numerous reports have highlighted the usefulness of 18 F-FDG PET in improving the ability to identify and treat patients with this disease, and several societies now incorporate cardiac 18 F-FDG PET findings as a diagnostic criterion for cardiac sarcoidosis [1]. Despite its increasing use, cardiac 18 F-FDG PET has several limitations in identifying cardiac sarcoidosis. The main drawback relates to physiologic myocardial 18 F-FDG uptake, which may occur under normal resting conditions in unaffected myocardium and poses challenges {{for the assessment of}} myocardial inflammation by 18 F-FDG PET. Several approaches to suppress physiologic myocardial glucose uptake have been proposed. The majority advocate <b>dietary</b> <b>preparations</b> which include restricting carbohydrate intake while promoting high-fat consumption, prolonged fasting, heparin administration, or a combination of these approaches. However, {{a number of studies have}} demonstrated that, even with these approaches, physiologic uptake may not be completely suppressed. The reasons are multifold. First, low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets are very difficult to follow, and ensuring compliance is particularly problematic [2 – 4]. Second, it is virtually impossible to completely eliminate carbohydrate intake from the diet. Third, even in the absence of carbohydrate ingestion, glucose metabolism is active in tissues with high concentrations of glycogen, such as the myocardium. With respect to heparin administration in an effort to increase free fatty acid availability and suppress glucose metabolism [5], the majority of the studies demonstrate suppression of physiologic uptake with heparin use [5 – 9], although two studies suggest the converse [10, 11]. Heparin administration is also associated with increased bleeding risk and may not be appropriate in some patients. Another limiting factor to the use of 18 F-FDG for assessment of cardiac sarcoidosis is that both inflammation and myocardial ischemia can increase glucose utilization and can further reduce the specificity of myocardial 18 F-FDG uptake. Thus, an alternative tracer that does not require complicated <b>dietary</b> or fasting <b>preparations</b> and that has less nonspecific myocardial uptake would be highly useful for cardiac sarcoidosis. 3 ′-deoxy- 3 ′- 18 F-fluorothymidine (18 F-FLT), a promising PET tracer for evaluating tumor proliferative activity, has potential in this regard but has not yet been investigated in a systematic manner. In contrast to 18 F-FDG, 18 F-FLT uptake in normal myocardium is low even without prolonged fasting and/or a special diet prior to imaging.|$|R

40|$|Myrtle (Myrtus communis L.) berries {{extracts}} {{were prepared}} with solvents at different polarity (water, ethanol, and ethyl acetate) and analysed using different in vitro tests {{in order to}} evaluate their antioxidant properties. Antiradical and total antioxidant activities were measured with DPPH and FRAP tests, respectively. Their ability to protect biological molecules was assessed using the cholesterol and LDL oxidation assays. In addition, phenolic compounds and unsaturated fatty acids composition was analysed by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS/MS. Ethanol and water extracts showed the highest amount of extracted compounds, but the highest antiradical and antioxidant activities were found in ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts. These extracts were also {{the ones with the}} highest content of phenolic compounds. In addition, our results showed a highly significant correlation between the amount of total phenols and antiradical (R 2 = 0. 9993) or antioxidant activities (R 2 = 0. 9985) in these extracts. HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS analyses showed significant quantitative and qualitative differences among these three extracts. The ethyl acetate extract had the highest protective effect in assays of thermal (140 °C) cholesterol degradation and Cu 2 +-mediated LDL oxidation, inhibiting the reduction of polyunsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol, and the increase of their oxidative products.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{a critical}} {{evaluation of the}} clinical evidence behind the use of <b>dietary</b> pomegranate <b>preparations</b> in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. A search of PubMed on August 10, 2014 identified 228 references, which yielded extractable data from 24 clinical studies of pomegranate preparations. Hand searching identified two further studies. The quality of the studies and evidence of effectiveness of pomegranate were assessed by an established set of conventional criteria. Overall, the study quality was poor. Even in the best studies, indications of benefit did not reach the conventional levels of statistical significance. The only study with a definitive design had a biochemical rather than a clinical endpoint: it showed the expected difference in blood concentrations of myeloperoxidase after a single dose of either pomegranate or placebo. Only 10 of the 26 studies provided HPLC data on the amounts of co-active ingredients in the preparations that were consumed by the subjects. If pomegranate has {{a role in the}} prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, there is a pressing need for dose-finding and long-term confirmatory studies. The ultimate endpoint for definitive studies would be mortality, but reductions in blood pressure or demonstrable decreases in atherosclerotic plaques would be useful surrogates.

Five types of tooth wear were studied: Occlusal wear, interproximal wear, subvertical grooves, buccal microwear and root striations. We found mild to moderate occlusal wear (stage range 2 – 4), the largest proximal facet on the M$_ 2 $ medial was 15. 3 mm$^ 2 $, presence of three subvertical grooves on the M$_ 2 $ distal surface, a variety of microwear scratches (many are > 200 mμ long and > 5 mμ wide) and two types of root striations.

40|$|We have {{recently}} {{shown that a}} polyphenol-rich insoluble <b>dietary</b> fibre <b>preparation</b> from carob pulp (Ceratonia siliqua L; carob fibre) decreased postprandial acylated ghrelin, TAG and NEFA during an acute liquid meal challenge test. However, delayed effects of carob fibre consumption are unknown. Therefore, a randomized controlled crossover study in nineteen healthy volunteers consuming foods with or without 50 g carob fibre was conducted. On the subsequent day (day 2), glucose, TAG, total and acylated ghrelin as well as insulin, NEFA and leptin were assessed at baseline and at timed intervals for 300 min after ingestion of standardized bread. Consumption of carob fibre-enriched foods did not affect fasting concentrations of glucose, TAG, total ghrelin, NEFA, insulin and leptin. Fasting acylated ghrelin was increased on the day subsequent to carob fibre consumption compared with control (P = 0. 046). After consumption of the standard bread on day 2, glucose response (P = 0. 029) was increased, and TAG (P = 0. 033) and NEFA (P &# 60; 0. 001) responses were decreased compared with control. Postprandial responses of total and acylated ghrelin, insulin and leptin on day 2 were unaffected by carob fibre consumption the previous day. In conclusion, an increase in total and acylated plasma ghrelin accompanied by enhanced lipid metabolism after carob fibre consumption suggests higher lipid utilization and suppressed lipolysis on the day subsequent to carob fibre consumption. However, elevated glucose levels after carob fibre consumption {{need to be addressed}} in future studies...|$|R

40|$|Thanks to {{the high}} rutin content of its grain and whole flour, tartary {{buckwheat}} can be proposed as an ingredient of new food preparations containing effective amounts of this bioactive compound credited to exert a growing multiplicity of health beneficial properties. In this respect, most <b>dietary</b> supplement <b>preparations,</b> containing around 50 mg of rutin, are suggested as the daily preventive dose. Considering that the content of rutin of tartary buckwheat whole flour usually ranges between 1000 up to 2000 mg/ 100 g dry weight, {{the introduction of a}} low percentage of this ingredient in the original recipe would allow to reach such amount in a food largely consumed like bread. Preliminary result would indicate that, in the preparation of a typical Tuscany bread, a certain amount (up to 20 %) of wheat flour can be replaced by a mixture of common and tartary buckwheat whole flour so to allegedly secure an intake of 50 mg of rutin through the average daily consumption of bread (about 200 g) in addition to an appreciable content of beneficial buckwheat protein and amylase resistant starch. However, efforts are to be dedicated to identify the most suited wheat flour in order not to impair texture, taste and acceptability of the bread so amended. In addition most of the rutin was not recovered in the final products, either degraded to quercetin or lost during preparation and baking processes.

Four <b>dietary</b> Artemia <b>preparations</b> were compared: (1) un-enriched; (2) enriched with a commercial EFA mixture (Easy DHA SELCO Emulsion); (3) enriched with a marine fish oil combination (VEVODAR and Incromega DHA) to provide a high ratio of ARA to DHA, and (4) enriched with these fish oils to provide a low ratio of ARA to DHA. Sole fed un-enriched Artemia were significantly less tolerant to hypoxia than the other dietary groups. Larvae from this group had significantly higher routine metabolic rate (RMR) in normoxia, and significantly higher O- 2 partial pressure (PO 2) thresholds in progressive hypoxia for their regulation of RMR (P-crit) and for the onset of agitation, respiratory distress and loss of equilibrium. Metamorphosis was associated with an overall decline in RMR and increase in P-crit, but juveniles fed on un-enriched Artemia still exhibited higher P-crit and agitation thresholds than the other groups. Sole fed un-enriched Artemia had significantly lower contents of EFA in their tissues, {{both before and after}} settlement. Thus, enriching live feeds with EFA has significant effects on the respiratory physiology of sole early life stages and improves their in vivo tolerance to hypoxia.
