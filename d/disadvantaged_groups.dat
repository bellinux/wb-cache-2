40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis describes {{a program of}} research that investigated the social psychological consequences of being a victim of discrimination. A series of four experiments with women, Asians, and Blacks examined how <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> numbers perceive the discrimination that confronts them. These experiments first established that <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> members sometimes perceive discrimination but more often, minimize the discrimination that is directed at them personally. Second, the results explain why <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> members are inclined to minimize their personal experience with discrimination, Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrate that by minimizing discrimination, <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> members protect their state self-esteem in the social domain, and maintain the perception of control over social and performance outcomes in their lives. Experiment 3 indicates that when there is any ambiguity about having been discriminated against, <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> members who are low in performance self-esteem but higher in social self-esteem are especially inclined to minimize personal discrimination. Experiment 4 further reveals that <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> members who are high in performance perceived control and high in social perceived control are particularly prone to minimize discrimination in an achievement context. Thus, <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> members minimize the discrimination that confronts them because the consequences of doing so, are, on balance, psychologically beneficial. Three of the four psychological processes associated with minimizing personal discrimination are those typically linked with better psychological adjustment: high social self-esteem, high performance perceived control, and high social perceived control...|$|R

5|$|Action T4 was a {{programme}} {{of systematic}} {{murder of the}} physically and mentally handicapped and patients in psychiatric hospitals that mainly took place from 1939 to 1941 and continued {{until the end of}} the war. Initially the victims were shot by the Einsatzgruppen and others; in addition gas chambers and gas vans using carbon monoxide were used by early 1940. Under the provisions of a law promulgated 14 July 1933, the Nazi regime carried out the compulsory sterilisation of over 400,000 individuals labelled as having hereditary defects. More than half the people sterilised were those considered mentally deficient, which included not only people who scored poorly on intelligence tests, but those who deviated from expected standards of behaviour regarding thrift, sexual behaviour and cleanliness. Mentally and physically ill people were also targeted. The majority of the victims came from <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>groups</b> such as prostitutes, the poor, the homeless and criminals. Other groups persecuted and killed included Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, social misfits and members of the political and religious opposition.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between social mobility and self-reported limiting long-term illness (LLTI) in West Indian and South Asian migrants in England and Wales present at the 1971, 1981 and 1991 Censuses in the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study. Most people remained in the same social position regardless of migrant status and those who remained most disadvantaged reported more LLTI than those who remained least disadvantaged. Amongst those who were mobile, upward mobility was more common than downward mobility for South Asians and West Indians but not for all other study members. The findings for the impact of downward mobility on LLTI were particularly striking. Migrants who were downwardly mobile reported more LLTI than all other study members. All other study members who were downwardly mobile reported more LLTI than people who remained in the least <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> they left but less than those who remained in the most <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> they joined. Downwardly mobile South Asians reported more LLTI than those of the least <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> but this was not significantly different from the most <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> they joined. Downwardly mobile West Indians reported also more LLTI than the least <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> they left but, in contrast, to the South Asians this appeared to be more than that of the <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> they joined. Empirical studies are needed to understand the context of social mobility and how this affects health-related behaviours and specific diseases among migrants. In a situation where migrants do not have established economic or social support, the loss of resources or self-esteem could have a disproportionate negative effect on their health.

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{a program of}} research aimed at delineating an important concept in the social psychology of intergroup relations: tokenism. A series of experiments first established that <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> members faced with open access to an advantaged group (meritocracy) choose either inaction or attempts at individual upward mobility. Conversely, those faced with an advantaged group that is closed (complete discrimination) engage primarily in collective nonnormative action. However, when faced with severe, but not total, discriminatory restrictions (tokenism), <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> members consistently prefer individual nonnormative action. This preference is unaffected by increases in ingroup identification, increased prior ingroup interaction, and removal of direct self-interest. Some support was found {{for the role of}} situational ambiguity in maintaining the preference for individual action in conditions of tokenism. In two final experiments the behavioral responses of "successful tokens" were investigated. These experiments show that successful tokens shift their allegiance from the <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> to the advantaged group and choose action in support of this new high-status ingroup {{at the expense of the}} <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group...</b>|$|R

This research used the unequal tuition fee increases at Simon Fraser University (SFU) to investigate international students’ CA intentions. We manipulated the contact partner’s (Canadian student) supportiveness and whether Canadian students directly benefited from the unequal tuition fee increases. The results indicated that when Canadian students were beneficiaries of the inequality, supportiveness from a Canadian student increased international students’ intentions of engaging in organizational disloyalty towards SFU (a form of CA) via increased group-based sadness. However, when Canadian students were bystanders, supportiveness decreased intentions of engaging in organizational disloyalty via reduced group-based sadness and fear...|$|R

25|$|A Federal Education Grants Act {{was also}} introduced, which opened up better chances of higher {{education}} for low-income children. In addition, labor-protection and anti-trust laws were significantly strengthened, while from 1969 to 1975 alone some 140 laws were passed that entitled various socially <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>groups</b> to tax subsidies. During the mid-Seventies recession, eligibility for short-term unemployment benefits was extended from 6 to 12 months, and to 24 months in some cases. Active Labour Market Policies were substantially expanded, {{with the number of}} people benefiting from such schemes increasing from 1,600 in 1970 to 648,000 by 1975. In addition, the SPD-FDP government gave more priority to raising minimum housing standards. The Law on Nursing Homes and Homes for the Elderly (1974) sought to guarantee minimum standards in an important area of social services, while the Beratungshilfegesetz (Legal Advice Act) of 1980 strengthened the position of the indigent in need of out of court legal advice and representation. The Maternity Leave Act of 1979 permitted mothers in work to take leave of 6 months after the birth of a child, granted a maternity allowance, and safeguarded jobs for 8 months.|$|E
25|$|Jane Jacobs' 1961 book The Death and Life of Great American Cities was a {{sustained}} critique of urban planning {{as it had}} developed within Modernism and marked a transition from modernity to postmodernity in thinking about urban planning (Irving 1993, 479). However, the transition from Modernism to Postmodernism is often said to have happened at 3:32pm on 15 July in 1972, when Pruitt Igoe; a housing development for low-income people in St. Louis designed by architect Minoru Yamasaki, which had been a prize-winning version of Le Corbusier's 'machine for modern living' was deemed uninhabitable and was torn down (Irving 1993, 480). Since then, Postmodernism has involved theories that embrace and aim to create diversity, and it exalts uncertainty, flexibility and change (Hatuka & D'Hooghe 2007). Postmodern planning aims to accept pluralism and heighten awareness of social differences in order to accept and bring to light the claims of minority and <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>groups</b> (Goodchild 1990). It {{is important to note}} that urban planning discourse within Modernity and Postmodernity has developed in different contexts, even though they both grew within a capitalist culture. Modernity was shaped by a capitalist ethic of Fordist-Keynesian paradigm of mass, standardized production and consumption, while postmodernity was created out of a more flexible form of capital accumulation, labor markets and organisations (Irving 1993, 60). Also, there is a distinction between a postmodernism of 'reaction' and one of 'resistance'. A postmodernism of 'reaction' rejects Modernism and seeks to return to the lost traditions and history in order to create a new cultural synthesis, while Postmodernity of 'resistance' seeks to deconstruct Modernism and is a critique of the origins without necessarily returning to them (Irving 1993, 60). As a result of Postmodernism, planners are much less inclined to lay a firm or steady claim to there being one single 'right way' of engaging in urban planning and are more open to different styles and ideas of 'how to plan' (Irving 474).|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a program of}} research aimed at examining the social psychological consequences of being a victim of discrimination. An experimental paradigm was developed to determine if, and to what extent, <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> members perceive the discrimination that confronts them.

When discrimination was made ambiguous, subjects minimized their personal experience with discrimination and attributed their failure to themselves. A second experiment investigated the role of perceived control as a potential cause of minimization of personal discrimination. The results indicated that <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> members were reluctant to blame their performance on discrimination because in so doing, they were placing control for their outcomes in the hands of others rather than themselves. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the on-going victimization of <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> members...|$|R
