When an insect stuck <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>web</b> owned by P. labiata, P. schultzi or any regional variant of P. fimbriata, and next to a web spider's web, the web spider sometimes enters the Portia′s web, and the Portia pursues and catches the web spider.|$|E

5|$|Another {{potential}} Guitar Hero {{project was}} discovered by the archival site Unseen64 for a game titled Hero World, a massively multiplayer online game that would link the Guitar Hero and DJ Hero games.

5|$|However, a {{shortage}} of developers who understood the necessary changes, and performance problems arising from conversion to and from UTF-16, which is rarely used <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>web</b> context, led to delays in the project. As a result, a PHP 5.3 release was created in 2009, with many non-Unicode features back-ported from PHP6, notably namespaces. In March 2010, the project {{in its current form}} was officially abandoned, and a PHP5.4 release was prepared containing most remaining non-Unicode features from PHP6, such as traits and closure re-binding. Initial hopes were that a new plan would be formed for Unicode integration, but as of 2014 none had been adopted.|$|E

25|$|Centipede {{reproduction}} {{does not}} involve copulation. Males deposit a spermatophore for the female to take up. In one clade, this spermatophore is deposited <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>web,</b> and the male undertakes a courtship dance to encourage the female to engulf his sperm. In other cases, the males just leave them for the females to find. In temperate areas, egg laying occurs in spring and summer, but in subtropical and tropical areas, little seasonality to centipede breeding is apparent. A few species of parthenogenetic centipedes are known.|$|E

It is common for a web to be about 20 times the size of the spider building it.|$|E
25|$|However, {{sympathetic}} Paraguayan nationalists {{and foreign}} revisionist historians have portrayed Solano López as a patriot who resisted to his last breath Argentine and Brazilian designs on Paraguay.
