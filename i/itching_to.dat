[...] According to GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd, the game's [...] "familiar rhythm will delight fans of the series, and the huge world, expansive quests, and hidden pleasures will have [...] <b>itching</b> <b>to</b> see what other joys you might uncover.

[...] He arrived at Providence on January 12, 1777, to lead the defense against the British at Newport. [...] There were 4,000 Rhode Island militia mobilized, and both the governor and Arnold's commander, General Spencer, were <b>itching</b> <b>to</b> drive the British out of Newport. [...] Arnold developed a plan for driving the British from Newport, but found that the militia were so poorly equipped and supplied that offensive operations were, in his view, ill-advised.|$|E

By {{the end of the}} show's 40th anniversary in 2009, 3-year-old viewers had increased by 41 percent, 4-year-olds by 4 percent, and 5-year-olds by 21 percent.

The writing staff, on the other hand, wanted Pam and Jim's moment to be private and only heard via the mics; Daniels explained, [...] "The writing staff was <b>itching</b> <b>to</b> do something kind of weird [...] and have it be a private moment that the doc crew didn't know {{was going to happen}} and so only heard on their mics and came running around the corner to film." [...] Eventually, both versions were filmed, but the former was broadcast. The alternate version has never been released.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} {{originally}} drew {{her to the}} role of Terri in an interview with TheTVChick, Gilsig said: [...] "Well, first of all, Ryan Murphy. Because I had worked with him on Nip/Tuck. And {{that was one of the}} best experiences as an actor I’ve ever had in my career. He really challenges you as an actor, and he really pushes you, and he really puts a lot of faith in actors to be able to — I think go further than they’ve ever gone before. Certainly for me on Nip/Tuck. You know, for obvious reasons…things I never thought I’d do. (laughs) But also just emotionally and character-wise and comedically. Every script was just this amazing emotional gymnastics. So that first of all: I was like great, I’d love to work with Ryan. And for me, the opportunity to do a comedy is something that I’ve been <b>itching</b> <b>to</b> do for many years now and also if I was going to do that–which is kind of a big risk for me–to be able to do that with Ryan, who I know so well, and then so much of the crew that I was familiar with from Nip/Tuck was kind of a dream scenario I would say." ...|$|E

2500|$|In this quirky dark comedy Santiago Morales (Manuel Rodriguez-Saenz) {{a former}} engineer, {{is unable to}} come to terms with the passing of his wife Viviana (Dalal Badr) who has died of cancer. Santiago rents a room in a house as he struggles to get his {{financial}} affairs from the marriage sorted out. He quickly becomes suicidal, obsessing over his late wife by watching videos of her on an iPad and building a shrine to her in his room. Santiago is very particular and keeps things neat, tidy, and organized which leads to clashes with his housemate/landlord Murray (Clinton Lee Pontes) who is a total slob and spends most of his time in his underwear in the living room of the house surrounded by trash and clutter. Santiago discovers that Murray is actually a disgraced geneticist with too much time on his hands. Murray was a rising star in the cloning field until he was caught conducting illegal experiments and was fired. He is <b>itching</b> <b>to</b> get back in the saddle so together they devise a plan involving the other housemate, Laura (Freya Ravensbergen), to clone Santiago's dead wife and thereby bring her back to life. [...] Laura has just lost her waitressing job and is unable to pay her debts so when presented with a relative financial windfall for her role, she reluctantly agrees to take part in the scheme to be the surrogate for their bizarro cloning experiment.|$|E
2500|$|The novel had its {{inception}} in a lecture Woolf gave to the National Society for Women's Service on January 21, 1931, an edited version of which would later be published as [...] "Professions for Women". Having recently published A Room of One's Own, Woolf thought of making this lecture {{the basis of a}} new book-length essay on women, this time taking a broader view of their economic and social life, rather than focusing on women as artists, as the first book had. As she was working on correcting the proofs of The Waves and beginning the essays for The Common Reader, Second Series, the idea for this essay took shape in a diary entry for 16 February 1932: [...] "And I'm quivering & <b>itching</b> <b>to</b> write my--whats it to be called?--'Men are like that?'--no thats too patently feminist: the sequel then, for which I have collected enough poweder to blow up St Pauls. It is to have 4 pictures" [...] (capitalization and punctuation as in manuscript). The reference to [...] "4 pictures" [...] in this diary entry shows the early connection between The Years and Three Guineas, which would, indeed, include photographs. [...] On 11 October 1932, she titled the manuscript [...] "THE PARGITERS: An Essay based upon a paper read to the London/National Society for Women's Service" [...] (capitalization as in manuscript). During this time, the idea of mixing the essay with fiction occurred to her, and in a diary entry of 2 November 1932, she conceived the idea of a [...] "novel-essay" [...] in which each essay would be followed by a novelistic passage presented as extracts from an imaginary longer novel, which would exemplify the ideas explored in the essay. Woolf began to collect materials about women's education and lives since the later decades of the 19th century, which she copied into her reading notebooks or pasted into scrapbooks, hoping to incorporate them into the essay portions of The Pargiters (they would ultimately be used for Three Guineas).|$|E
