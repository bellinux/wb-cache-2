5|$|A {{whole week}} passed before Grace reappeared, again at Lord's, on Monday, 3 June. He played seven matches in June, all first-class, {{starting}} with MCC v Derbyshire. This was a three-day match completed on the Tuesday with MCC winning by 5 wickets. Derbyshire won the toss, elected to bat and Grace proceeded to bowl {{them out for}} a mere 36. His figures were 8–23. Derbyshire then bowled MCC out for 74, Grace scoring 7. Grace took 2 more wickets in Derbyshire's second innings of 118 to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>his</b> second 10-wicket match of the season. He scored 37 in the second innings as MCC made 81–5 to take the match.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1936–37 season, the Rangers signed Johnson {{to serve}} as the {{defensive}} coach while he continued to play. He appeared in 35 games but scored no points. Seeing little playing time, and having an offer to coach a minor league team, Johnson requested that the Rangers <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>his</b> outright release following the season. Believing that he had become too slow to play, the team agreed. He subsequently signed with the New York Americans, with whom he played one final NHL season in 1937–38.|$|E
5|$|Later that evening, Jiminy and {{his parents}} {{convince}} a couple {{to give up some}} goods in exchange for a tonic that will supposedly make them immune to a plague. He soon discovers that his father switched Rumpelstiltskin's tonic with the one they sold, and finds that the couple have been turned into dolls. Even worse, he then discovers that the couple were the parents of the young boy he spoke to earlier. Having realized what he has done, Jiminy makes a wish and receives an answer from The Blue Fairy, who shows up to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>his</b> one true wish: becoming a cricket. Jiminy is also told that {{he has a chance to}} help someone in the future, starting with the young boy, who would grow up to be Gepetto. As for the cursed dolls, they end up as a collection at Mr. Gold's (Carlyle) pawn shop.|$|E

5|$|Khandoba is {{described}} as doing odd jobs under Banai's orders. Banai first assigns him the task of sweeping the entire vada. He is responsible for cleaning the sheep pens and taking the sheep and lambs for grazing. He completes all tasks by spreading his magical bhandara. The shepherds are astonished how a single old man can handle all the animals. Their vanity is crushed. Banai assigns him the additional responsibility {{of taking care of}} five hundred children. She commands if any sheep or lamb is lost or a child cries, she will not <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>his</b> food. But Khandoba fulfils the tasks again by spraying his bhandara. She assigns him the job of washing the sheep and lambs. Instead, Khandoba kills all her sheep and lambs to humble the shepherds and Banai. He skins the sheep and separates the meat. A repentant Banai begs his forgiveness; he agrees to revive her flock on the condition that Banai marries him. Khandoba revives the sheep by spreading his bhandara and reveals his true form.|$|E

25|$|In 600, Khosrow II {{executed}} Al-Nu'man III, King of the Lakhmids of Al-Hira, {{presumably because}} of the Arab king's refusal to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>his</b> daughter al-Ḥurqah in marriage and insulting Persian women. Afterwards the central government took over {{the defense of the}} western frontiers to the desert, and the buffer state of the Lakhmids vanished. This ultimately facilitated the Muslim Caliphs' invasion and conquest of Lower Iraq, less than a decade after Khosrow's death.|$|E
25|$|After {{three years}} at the Old Vic, Olivier advised Gambon to gain {{experience}} in provincial rep. In 1967, he left the NT for the Birmingham Repertory Company, which was to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>his</b> first crack at the title roles in Othello (his favourite), Macbeth and Coriolanus. Gambon was suggested {{for the role of}} James Bond in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), although he was dismissed for being even less known than George Lazenby who was cast.|$|E
25|$|Every city (without exception) had a Council and a Bench, the Council {{being the}} {{administrative}} branch and the Bench the judicial branch. A new Council {{was chosen by}} the old one whose term had expired. The Council was responsible for administration, law, privileges, security, finances, guild oversight, and the like. The Council chose the Mayor, and its members' decision was final—even the Starosta or Voivode could only listen to the Mayor's swearing-in and could not refuse to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>his</b> seal. The Council met daily in the larger cities, less often in smaller ones.|$|E

25|$|At Radio 1 Everett {{continued}} {{to develop his}} own unique presentation style, encouraged by producer Angela Bond, who had persuaded her superiors to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>his</b> first programme, although he later reacted against her {{as a representative of}} the BBC. Everett's Radio 1 show featured zany voices, surreal characters, multi-tracked jingles and trailers, all of his own creation and compilation. It was Everett who had persuaded Johnny Beerling and station controller Robin Scott, at a lunch meeting before his appointment, of the importance of the new station having jingles. Everett's shows on BBC Radio 1 included Midday Spin, and in 1968 he took over a Saturday show from 10.00am to 12.00 noon.|$|E
25|$|When Fred Trueman and Statham toured Australia for the 1962-63 Ashes series {{they had}} 216 and 229 wickets {{respectively}} were poised to overtake {{the record of}} 236 Test wickets set by the assistant-manager Alec Bedser. The Australian captain Richie Benaud was another contender with 219 wickets, but it was Statham who broke the record in the Fourth Test at Adelaide. Trueman caught Barry Shepherd in the gully to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>his</b> record 237th wicket. Despite the record Statham rarely shined on the tour, taking 13 wickets (44.61), and {{was used as a}} steady stock bowler. Statham took his record to 242 wickets, but returned to England while Trueman continued to New Zealand, where he broke Statham's record after only two months.|$|E

25|$|On August 3, 1948, {{with the}} Indians one game behind the Athletics, Boudreau started Paige against the Washington Senators in Cleveland. The 72,562 people {{that saw the}} game set a new {{attendance}} record for a major league night game. Although a nervous Paige walked two {{of the first three}} batters and gave up a triple to Bud Stewart to fall behind 2–0, by the time he left in the seventh, the Indians were up 4–2 and held on to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>his</b> second victory. His next start was at Comiskey Park in Chicago. 51,013 people paid to see the game, but many thousands more stormed the turnstiles and crashed into the park, overwhelming the few dozen ticket-takers. Paige went the distance, shutting out the White Sox, 5–0, debunking the assumption that nine innings of pitching was now beyond his capabilities.|$|E
25|$|In his {{two years}} at Cardiff the team had a fairly mediocre time {{finishing}} {{near the bottom of}} Division Two in both seasons. McCulloch however had good form, top scoring in both seasons, notching 30 goals in 68 matches in all competitions. It was at this time that he was called up for his only cap for the Scotland under-23 team, his Scottish parentage making him eligible even though he was born in England. Cardiff won the Welsh Cup in both seasons that McCulloch played there, qualifying them for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and in September 1973 McCulloch played against Sporting Clube de Portugal in the two-legged first round tie of the cup which Cardiff lost 2–1 on aggregate to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>his</b> only experience of European football in his career. In July 1974 he moved to another Second Division side, Oxford United in a £70,000 deal, he had a fairly disappointing time at Oxford with the team relegated in his second season (1975–76) and McCulloch making only 12 League appearances.|$|E
25|$|The Adelaide Oval was {{notoriously}} flat, but Garth McKenzie was {{an expert}} on getting batsmen out on dull wickets and used the humid atmosphere and fresh pitch to bowl Bob Barber for a duck and have John Edrich caught by the ever-reliable Simpson at slip. Ian Chappell took a superb catch off Neil Hawke to remove Geoff Boycott and England were 33/3. Ken Barrington (60) and Colin Cowdrey (38) began to rebuild the innings with a 72 run partnership, until Cowdrey heard a shout from the Australian wicketkeeper Wally Grout, thought he was being called and was run out. Debutant Keith Stackpole took a great catch off Jim Parks (49) to give McKenzie his third wicket, who then removed Dave Allen and Dave Brown to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>his</b> second five wicket haul in successive Tests. England were 240/9 {{at the end of}} the first day, which soon became 241 all out as McKenzie caught Fred Titmus (33) leg before wicket first thing in the morning to give him 6/48, his best Test bowling figures to date.|$|E

25|$|Having {{rolled up}} his tent and packed his luggage, Whymper wished to hasten to Zermatt {{to attempt to}} reach the summit from that side, but he could find no porters. A young Englishman arrived with a guide. Whymper made himself known to him, and learnt that he was Lord Francis Douglas, who had lately ascended the Ober Gabelhorn; he told him the whole story, and confided his plans to him. Douglas, declaring himself in his turn most anxious to ascend the Matterhorn, agreed to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>his</b> porter, and {{on the morning of}} the 12th they started {{together}} for the Theodul pass. They descended to Zermatt, sought and engaged Peter Taugwalder, and gave him permission to choose another guide. When they returned to the Monte Rosa Hotel, they encountered Michel Croz who had been hired by Charles Hudson. They had come to Zermatt with the same intention, to attempt to ascend the Matterhorn. Hudson and his friend Douglas Hadow decided to join Whymper and Douglas and that same evening everything was settled; they were to start immediately, the very next day.|$|E
25|$|During Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days, Saïx assigns {{missions}} {{to the other}} Organization members. He is also assigned by Xemnas to oversee the progress of Xion, and is the one to discover Marluxia's plans to betray the Organization with Larxene, sending Axel to eliminate them. Towards {{the end of the}} game, he attacks Roxas when he attempts to leave the Organization, only to lose to the younger Nobody. In Kingdom Hearts II, Saïx appears before Sora in Twilight Town to stir unrest in him by warning him of Axel's intention to turn him into a Heartless. He later appears after Sora defeats the Heartless army at Hollow Bastion, where he explains Sora's purpose in the Organization's plans, and reveals to him that the Organization are holding Kairi hostage, Saïx having kidnapped her from Axel earlier, to ensure Sora keeps destroying Heartless for them. Saïx fights Sora on the latter's climb through the Castle That Never Was, using the moonlight from Kingdom Hearts to assume a berserker state, but Sora defeats him and he fades into darkness while pining for Kingdom Hearts to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>his</b> heart back.|$|E
25|$|Iqbal's first ODI {{was against}} Sri Lanka, {{a game in}} which the whole Pakistani batting line-up capitulated. He showed that he {{preferred}} to take his time to get settled {{in the middle of the}} pitch. Because of that, the selectors chose to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>his</b> first Test match start soon after. He started his International test career during Pakistan's tour of New Zealand where he played multiple strong innings in which he displayed his range of strokes and the ability to play off some hostile bowling. Iqbal was a prolific junior-level scorer. He played two Tests in South Africa in 2003–04 but was dropped after not performing well. Upon returning to Test cricket after a two-year hiatus, he scored his maiden Test century against India to help Pakistan win the 2005–06 Test series in the final Test in Karachi. He proved his doubters wrong by playing some solid innings especially an impressive innings against Australia which turned out to be in vain as it did not prevent a loss. He continued on for a few more tours but was ultimately dropped due to a lean period where he did not contribute significantly with the bat. He continued to play domestic cricket though and was recalled to the side after injuries hit some of the other players.|$|E
