5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1361 of William de Cambuslang, Bishop of Dunblane, Walter {{was elected by}} the Dunblane cathedral chapter {{to be the new}} bishop. On his election, Walter possessed no benefices in the diocese, and had had none since giving up his Abernethy prebend a decade before. However, it was {{probably}} the diocese of his birth, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> become archdeacon of the diocese in 1345.|$|E
5|$|Born {{near the}} eastern edge of the Cape Colony, Kruger took part in the Great Trek as a child during the late 1830s. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> no {{education}} apart from the Bible and, through his interpretations of scripture, believed the Earth was flat. A protégé of the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius, he witnessed the signing of the Sand River Convention with Britain in 1852 and over the next decade played a prominent role in the forging of the South African Republic, leading its commandos and resolving disputes between the rival Boer leaders and factions. In 1863 he was elected Commandant-General, a post he held for a decade before he resigned soon after the election of President Thomas François Burgers.|$|E
5|$|As {{an adult}} Reich wrote extensively, in his diary, about his sexual precocity. He {{maintained}} {{that his first}} sexual experience was {{at the age of}} four when he tried to have sex with the family maid (with whom he shared a bed), that he would regularly watch the farm animals have sex, that he used a whip handle sexually on the horses while masturbating, and that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> daily sexual intercourse from the age of 11 with another of the servants. He wrote of regular visits to brothels, the first when he was 15, and said he was visiting them daily from the age of around 17. He also developed sexual fantasies about his mother, writing when he was 22 that he masturbated while thinking about her.|$|E

5|$|Hibs {{suffered}} an injury during the semi-final, when their regular goalkeeper Graham Stack {{had to be}} substituted due to a thigh injury. A scan following the match showed {{that he would be}} unable to play for between 10 and 12 weeks, and therefore would miss the final. Hibs secured their place in the Scottish Premier League with one game to spare and rested several players for the final game of their league programme. Defender Matt Doherty suffered a foot injury in that league game, but manager Pat Fenlon said he was confident Doherty would be able to play in the final. Fenlon then took his squad to his home town of Dublin to prepare for the cup final and told the media that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> finalised his team selection.|$|E
5|$|Nynaeve, {{under the}} {{instruction}} of Cadsuane, locates Tam al'Thor, Rand's father, who meets with Rand {{in an attempt to}} break his emotional isolation. Rand becomes angry when he learns that Tam was sent by Cadsuane, nearly killing his father before fleeing in horror at what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> done. Rand Travels to the Seanchan-held city of Ebou Dar, intending to destroy their entire army, but he becomes reluctant to act after seeing how peaceful the city is. Nearly mad with rage and grief, he Travels to the top of Dragonmount, the location where he killed himself in a past life. Angry at the futility of life bound to the Wheel, he uses the Choedan Kal to draw enough power to destroy the world. Lews Therin, a voice in Rand's head from his past life, suggests that by being reborn one has the opportunity to do things right. Agreeing, Rand turns the power of the Choedan Kal against itself, destroying it. Rand is finally able to laugh again.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, 1900, {{during the}} British march on Pretoria, Burnham was wounded, almost fatally. He {{was on a}} mission to cut off the flow of Boer gold and {{supplies}} to and from the sea and to halt the transportation of British prisoners of war out of the Pretoria. He scouted alone far to the east behind enemy lines trying to identify the best choke point along the Pretoria-Delagoa Bay railway line. He came upon an underpass of a railway bridge, an ideal location to disrupt the trains, but was immediately surrounded by a party of Boers. Burnham instantly fled and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> escaped when his horse was shot and fell, knocking him senseless and pinning him under its dead body. It was night and he was already far away when his horse was shot, so the Boer troopers apparently did not check to see if Burnham had been injured or killed. When he awoke hours later, Burnham was alone and in a dazed state having sustained serious injuries. In spite of his acute agony, Burnham proceeded to creep back to the railway, placed his charges, and blew up the line in two places. He then crept {{on his hands and knees}} to an empty animal enclosure to avoid capture and stayed there for two days and nights insensible. The next day, Burnham heard fighting in the distance so he crawled in that direction. By this time he was indifferent as to the source of the gunshots and by chance it was a British patrol that found him. Once in Pretoria the surgeons discovered that Burnham had torn apart his stomach muscles and burst a blood-vessel. His very survival was due only to the fact that he had been without food or water for three days.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, Taoiseach Jack Lynch {{suggested}} {{to the opposition}} parties that they agree to nominate Ó Dálaigh to become President of Ireland when President de Valera's last term ended in June of the following year. Fine Gael, confident that its prospective candidate, Tom O'Higgins, would win the 1973 presidential election (<b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> defeated de Valera in 1966) turned down the offer. Fianna Fáil's Erskine H. Childers {{went on to win}} the election.|$|E
25|$|Slowly Hazlitt {{began to}} find enough work to eke out a bare living. His outrage at events then taking place in English {{politics}} in reaction to Napoleon's wars led to his writing and publishing, at his own expense (though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> no money), a political pamphlet, Free Thoughts on Public Affairs (1806), an attempt to mediate between private economic interests and a national application of the thesis of his Essay that human motivation is not, inherently, entirely selfish.|$|E

Stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, he was temporarily detailed to Quantico for a special training course. On 3 May, Aldrich was given leave to visit his family in Chicago, but encountered engine trouble while en route to Naval Air Station Glenview. He attempted to land at Ashburn Airport, which was closed due to mud. His Corsair flipped over when its wheels touched the ground and Aldrich was killed. He was buried at the Oak Woods Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|His {{expedition}} left Tahiti {{and sailed}} westward to southern Samoa and the New Hebrides, then on sighting Espiritu Santo turned west {{still looking for}} the Southern Continent. On 4 June he almost ran into heavy breakers and had to change course {{to the north and}} east. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> found the Great Barrier Reef. He sailed through what is now known as the Solomon Islands but, because of the hostility of the people there, avoided landing. He named Bougainville Island for himself. The expedition was attacked by people from New Ireland so the French expedition made for the Moluccas. At Batavia, they received news of Wallis and Carteret who had preceded Bougainville in discovering Tahiti.|$|E
25|$|The rest of {{his life}} Rodrigo devoted to the aggrandisement of his newfound order. According to a bull of Innocent III he chose for his Order a half-red, half-white cross. He {{received}} support from Alfonso II of Aragon, who donated the castle of Alfambra to the order in return for military aid against the Muslims. He was also able to acquire estates in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, including Mountjoy, after which the order took its name. In 1176–77 he made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He received lands from Reginald of Châtillon that King Baldwin IV only confirmed on the condition that Rodrigo and his knights fight the Muslims continuously in the Holy Land. In 1186 an attempted merger was made with the Knights Templar, and it is possible that Rodrigo was already dying at that stage. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> certainly died by the autumn of 1187. He was buried in the convent of Alfambra. He had been a patron of the Cistercians. Besides founding a military order under their auspices, he endowed their foundations at Gradefes (29 September 1173) and Meira (1182).|$|E

25|$|Kuge {{refers to}} a Japanese aristocratic class, and waka poetry was a {{significant}} feature of their typical lifestyle, and this includes the nyobo or court ladies. In ancient times, it was a custom for kuge to exchange waka instead of letters in prose. Sometimes improvised waka were used in daily conversation in high society. In particular, the exchange of waka was common between lovers. Reflecting this custom, five of the twenty volumes of the Kokin Wakashū (or Kokinshū) gathered waka for love. In the Heian period the lovers would exchange waka {{in the morning when}} lovers parted at the woman's home. The exchanged waka were called Kinuginu (後朝), because it was thought the man wanted to stay with his lover and when the sun rose <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> no time to don his clothes which had been laid out in place of a mattress (as was the custom in those days). Soon, writing and reciting Waka became a part of aristocratic culture. People recited a piece of appropriate waka freely to imply something on an occasion. In the Pillow Book it is written that a consort of Emperor Murakami memorized over 1,000 waka in Kokin Wakashū with their description.|$|E

Robert Scigliano, a journalist and academic from the Michigan State University Vietnam Advisory Group, asserted that Cẩn, along with Nhu, Madame Nhu and eldest brother Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục formed [...] "an extralegal elite which, with Diệm, directs the destiny of Vietnam".

500|$|Srinivasa Ramanujan [...] ( [...] , 22 December 188726 April 1920) was an Indian {{mathematician}} {{who lived}} during the British Rule in India. Though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> no {{formal training in}} pure mathematics, [...] he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems considered to be unsolvable. Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation; it was quickly recognized by Indian mathematicians. Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a postal partnership with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England. Recognizing the extraordinary work sent to him as samples, Hardy arranged travel for Ramanujan to Cambridge. In his notes, Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that Hardy stated had 'defeated [...] completely', in addition to rediscovering recently proven but highly advanced results.|$|E
500|$|For both Devil May Cry 3 and Devil May Cry 4 Dante was {{voiced by}} Reuben Langdon who also did the motion capture for certain scenes. During the {{development}} of Devil May Cry 3, Langdon found that doing the motion capture of Dante was difficult to the multiple moves the character makes. Langdon often discussed with the staff about Dante's characterization that {{was different from the}} original one as they wanted [...] "a different spin." [...] Eventually, Langdon decided to do his own rendition of Dante as he was confused with the staff's suggestions. In retrospective, Langdon finds Dante [...] "the most difficult, frustrating and yet rewarding character" [...] he has ever played and stated he grew attached with him. Langdon was told to make Devil May Cry 4s Dante similar to his Devil May Cry 3 persona albeit more mature. Despite the staff's concerns for the difficulties of such portrayal, Langdon had no issues after choosing Roy Focker from the anime series The Super Dimension Fortress Macross as his character model and noting <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> the same age as Dante during production of the game.|$|E
