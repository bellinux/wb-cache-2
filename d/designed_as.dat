40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{concepts}} of design and design science {{in a number of}} disciplines, including information systems (IS). The authors identify and explore various viewpoints or perspectives on design in a number of disciplines including management, engineering, architecture, product development and so on. These perspectives include <b>design</b> <b>as</b> product, <b>design</b> <b>as</b> process or action, <b>design</b> <b>as</b> intention, <b>design</b> <b>as</b> planning including modeling, representation and method, <b>design</b> <b>as</b> communication, <b>design</b> <b>as</b> user experience, <b>design</b> <b>as</b> a value, <b>design</b> <b>as</b> professional practice and <b>design</b> <b>as</b> service. This broad and diverse set of perspectives are contrasted with what is identified and characterized by the authors as a limiting technological perspective of design adopted by the current extant papers in the mainstream IS journals. The paper concludes with a call to broaden and further develop the concept of design, and hence design science, into an integrated holistic sociotechnical view that includes the human social and organizational factors alongside the technical factors...|$|R

SageBook browses previously created data-graphics relevant to current needs. SAGE automatically designs data-graphics, interpreting the user's specifications as conveyed with the other tools. The combined environment, SageTools, enhances user-directed design by providing automatic presentation capabilities with styles of interaction that support data-graphic design...|$|R
