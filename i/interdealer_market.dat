5000|$|OTC Markets are {{generally}} separated into two key segments: the customer {{market and the}} <b>interdealer</b> <b>market.</b> Customers almost exclusively trade through dealers {{because of the high}} search and transaction costs. Dealers are large institutions that arrange transactions for their customers, utilizing their specialized knowledge, expertise, and access to capital. In order to hedge the risks incurred by transacting with customers, dealers turn to the <b>interdealer</b> <b>market,</b> or the exchange-traded markets.

40|$|This {{dissertations}} {{includes three}} (3) chapters, each {{adding to the}} growing network games literature that incorporates incomplete information. Financial over-the-counter markets give motivating applications. (1) "Trading Networks and Equilibrium Intermediation" studies the efficiency of trade in networks. A network of intermediaries facilitates exchange between buyers and a seller. Intermediary traders face a private trading cost, a network characterizes the set of feasible transactions, and an auction mechanism sets prices. Stable networks, which are robust to agents' collusive actions, exist when cost uncertainty is acute and multiple, independent trading relationships are valuable. A free-entry process governs the formation of equilibrium networks. Such networks feature too few intermediaries relative to the optimal market organization and they exhibit an asymmetric structure amplifying the shocks experienced by key intermediaries. (2) "Interdealer Trade: Risk, Liquidity, {{and the role of}} Market Inventory" further studies traders facing private shocks, placed in a dynamic setting. Trades between ex ante symmetric, inventory carrying intermediaries ("dealers") are motivated by divergent liquidity needs of the counter parties. Market prices and asset flows are pinned by dealers' indifference between providing intermediation services and retaining liquidity to be utilized in subsequent <b>interdealer</b> <b>markets.</b> More active <b>interdealer</b> <b>markets</b> simultaneously increase the value to intermediation and the option-value to providing these services. Under infrequent shocks, interdealer trade boosts the availability of liquidity in the broader market. This boost decays with market inventory, which serves as a constraint on interdealer activity. Through this market mechanism, prices vary inversely with both search frictions between dealers and on their total current holdings. (3) "Information Acquisition and Response in Peer-effects Networks" endogenizes the quality of information that market participants carry in a general peer effects model. When pairwise peer effects are symmetric, asymmetries in acquired information are inefficiently low relative to the utilitarian benchmark. And with information privately acquired, all players face strictly positive gains to overstating their informativeness as to strategically influence the beliefs and behaviors of neighbors. If strategic substitutes in actions are present and significant, low centrality players move against their signals in anticipation of their neighbors' actions. A blueprint for optimal policy design is developed. Applications to market efficiency in financial crises and two-sided markets are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The eight local {{currency}} government bond markets {{in which the}} ABF 2 invests have made significant strides since the fund’s inception in 2005. Liquidity has improved considerably {{in most of these}} markets and yield curves have become increasingly reliable. These improvements may be traced to the following factors: (a) the growth of bond issuance in general and the consolidation of issuance in a few benchmark maturities; (b) the increase in market making activity, especially with the development of <b>interdealer</b> <b>markets</b> and the entry of interdealer brokers; and (c) the lowering of barriers to participation by non-resident investors. In each of these factors, the ABF 2 project played an important catalytic role. But there remains work to be done. Depth and liquidity could still be improved by the development of repo markets and an opening up to non-resident investors. While issuance in the {{local currency}} corporate bond markets has surged, these markets have yet to develop active secondary markets. These markets would benefit from more effective market-making arrangements and the introduction of certain types of derivatives. 1 This report was prepared at the request of Mr Akinari Horii, former Assistant Governor of the Bank of Japa...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Credit default swaps (CDSs) {{are among}} the most {{successful}} financial innovations of recent years, which is reflected in the rapidly expanding market. CDS trading occurs in the over-the-counter market, which relies heavily on broker intermediation to arrange trades. We provide empirical evidence that liquidity in the voice brokered market varies with the particulars of the CDS contracts and that the differences in market structure is reflected in the costs of liquidity. Moreover, the brokered and direct <b>interdealer</b> trading <b>markets</b> seem to be well integrated; thus the higher liquidity costs in the brokered market may reflect the value of intermediation.

We report two standard microstructure phenomena: microstructure noise effects in the signature plot and the Epps effect. We find an unusual shape for the average book, the spread distribution being bimodal. We construct the order flow and analyse its main characteristics: volume, placement, arrival intensity and sign. Many quantities have been dramatically affected by the decrease of the tick size in March 2011. We argue that the coexistence of manual traders and algorithmic traders, who react differently to the new tick size, leads to a strong price clustering in all types of orders and affects the price formation...|$|R

Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) had found itself with losing short positions in on-therun Treasury securities, and yields on these securities were particularly volatile. Trading activity was intense, with durations between transactions shorter than usual. Using tick-by-tick data on interdealer transactions in the on-the-run twoyear, five-year, and ten-year notes, {{we find that}} during such periods of intense trading, the effect of trade flows on price movements became stronger, a phenomenon Dufour and Engle (2000) have documented for the stock market. We also find that during times of stress, depth was asymmetric between buy and sell sides, and this asymmetry affected the importance of trade flows for price movements. Moreover, market-makers seemed exceptionally reluctant to take risks. After identifying ten particularly stressful days for each on-the-run security, {{we find that the}} effect of trad...|$|E

We provide a theoretical foreign exchange pricing model that accounts for market power considerations and analyze a database of the trades of a German market maker and his cross section of end-user customers. We find that the market maker generally exerts low bargaining power vis- 1 -vis his customers. The dealer earns lower average spreads on trades with financial customers than commercial customers, even though the former are perceived to convey exchange-rate-relevant information.

We next study the effects of data releases on trading volumes. News releases cause volume to rise, and to remain elevated for a longer period. However, in contrast to the result for the level of the exchange rate, even if the data release is entirely in line with expectations, we find that there is still typically a large pickup in trading volume.

Using a unique data set including dealer identities the results further indicate that dealers are heterogeneous. Varying predictive power of the order ow of di¤erent groups of dealers imply that dealers have di¤erent sources of information. Dealers with a high share of delayed publication trades appear to have stronger predictive power than other dealers.

40|$|Market makers on {{financial}} markets often act as competitiors and step into cooperations {{with each other}} at the same time. Primarily, they quote prices for investors, thus providing liquidity on the customer market. But they also trade with each other in order to reduce their inventory risk. The interdealer markets differs from walrasian markets in three main features: the trades are bilateral, the players usually form trading networks, the players have different bargaining powers. This paper describes the situation when customer and interdealers markets are strongly interconnected and characterizes the market equilibrium. Moreover, we investigate on different pricing strategies followed by market makers on the customer markets, when interdealer risk allocation is allowed. In this setup market makers operate in a duopoly on the customer market, and trading counterparties with different bargaining power on the interdealer markets. We show that the presence of an <b>interdealer</b> <b>market</b> reduces the market powers on the customer markets. We find also that the more risk averse market makers are, the lesser the market power on the customer market...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the dynamic relationship between credit risk and liquidity in the sovereign bond {{market in the}} context of the European Central Bank (ECB) interventions. Using a comprehensive set of liquidity measures obtained from a detailed, quote-level dataset of the largest <b>interdealer</b> <b>market</b> for Italian government bonds, we show that changes in credit risk, as measured by the Italian sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spread, generally drive the liquidity of the market: a 10 % change in the CDS spread leads a 11 % change in the bid-ask spread. This relationship is stronger, and the transmission is faster, when the CDS spread is above the 500 basis point threshold, estimated endogenously, and can be ascribed to changes in margins and collateral, as well as clientele effects. Moreover, we show that the Long-Term Refinancing Operations (LTRO) intervention by the ECB weakened the sensitivity of the liquidity provision by the market makers to changes in the Italian government’s credit risk.

40|$|The thesis investigates {{information}} and liquidity provision in financial markets. I explore {{the implications of}} the strategic behaviour of market makers competing with high frequency traders and of dealers involved in long term relationships with clients in the foreign exchange markets. Additionally, I analyse the value of information from the liquidity order flow to market makers and dealers. Further, I reflect on regulatory implications of my findings. The first chapter presents a literature review to motivate the following chapters. First, I survey the main findings of the papers on market making most relevant to this thesis. Second, I discuss the regulatory and academic debate on high frequency traders, which are widely viewed as a new type of liquidity providers. Third, I discuss important differences between market makers and FX dealers, including specific features of foreign exchange markets and their informational structure. Lastly, I provide a brief overview of the recent regulatory debate on OTC markets. The second chapter analyses the effect of competition between a designated, traditional market maker and a High Frequency Trader providing liquidity. The market maker is risk neutral and the high frequency trader is risk averse, which creates differences in their inventory exposures. The market power of these two participants creates a bid ask spread, but the high frequency trader narrows the spread and improves liquidity. The chapter further investigates the liquidity provision by a monopolistic high frequency trader. I show that having agents with strong inventory concerns as market makers could hamper liquidity provision. I explain how ceteris paribus small changes in the reservation value of liquidity traders can trigger shifts in the equilibrium spread. The third chapter endogenizes the existence of intermediation in a two-tier market. Specifically, trading takes place sequentially in a client-dealer OTC market and in an <b>interdealer</b> <b>market</b> organised as a limit order book. A privately-informed client chooses between trading through dealers or paying an entry cost to join the <b>interdealer</b> <b>market</b> directly. Dealer rents from intermediation increase in the entry cost. I show that competitive dealers use the bid ask spread strategically to reward the client for the information conveyed by his order flow. Furthermore, I show that the client dealer relationship is affected by a commitment problem: clients who trade una tantum execute trades with multiple dealers. Ongoing client dealer relationships viewed as an infinitely repeated game can overcome this problem and the client may benefit from trading exclusively with one dealer. The fourth chapter analyses information sharing and collusion incentives of strategic liquidity providers and the impact of their cooperation on asset prices. Risk neutral liquidity providers operate in a market with risk-averse informed traders (fundamentalists) and noise traders. I consider four regimes: 1) pure market making; 2) dealership without information sharing; 3) dealership with information sharing but without collusion in trading; and 4) dealership with information sharing and collusion in trading. I show that information sharing substantially increases agents' profits, while colluding in trading has a relatively low additional impact on profits. This suggests that if there are penalties for collusion, dealers may choose to only share information, but not to collude. Furthermore, I investigate the effect of the four regimes on market depth, volatility of prices and information content of prices. I find that dealers sharing {{information and}} colluding increase market depth compared to dealership without information sharing. However, the market depth is lower compared to pure market making. Both volatility of prices and the information content of prices increase when liquidity providers act as dealers. The magnitude of these differences depends on the parameters of the model.

We seek to compute the purely statistical effects of the presence of large numbers of traders, as scaling laws on various measures of liquidity, and to this end we allow our model very few parameters. We find that the bid-offer spread scales as √(1 / Deal Rate). In addition we investigate the scaling of other intuitive relationships, such as the relation between fluctuations of the best bid/offer and the density of buyers/sellers. We then study this model and its scaling laws under the influence of random disturbances to trader drift, trader volatility, and entrance rate. We also study possible extensions to the model, such as the addition of market order traders, and an interaction that models momentum-type trading. Finally, we discuss how detailed simulations may be carried out to study scaling in all of these settings, and how the models may be tested inactual markets. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{absence of}} data has, until now, precluded {{virtually}} all research on trading volume {{in the foreign}} exchange market. This paper introduces a new high-frequency foreign exchange dataset from EBS (Electronic Broking Service) that includes trading volume in the global <b>interdealer</b> spot <b>market.</b> The dataset gives volumes and prices at the one-minute frequency over a five-year time period in the euro-dollar and dollar-yen currency pairs. We first document intraday volume patterns in euro-dollar and dollar-yen trading, noting the effects of macroeconomic news announcements but also purely institutional factors. We {{study the effects of}} UK-specific holidays on euro-dollar and dollar-yen trading volume and find that these holidays cause a sharp decline in trading volume even among dealers outside the UK, a natural experiment that we interpret as further evidence that trading activity is not driven solely by the flow of news about fundamentals. Studying the reaction to U. S. macroeconomic announcements, we show that a sharp pickup in trading volume generally occurs in the minutes following news announcements. This rise in trading volume happens even if the data release is entirely in line with market expectations, and it is often negatively related to the dispersion of ex-ante market expectations.

40|$|This paper uses intraday {{data from}} the <b>interdealer</b> {{government}} bond <b>market</b> to investigate the effects of scheduled macroeconomic announcements on prices, trading volume, and bid-ask spreads. We find that 17 public news releases, {{as measured by the}} surprise in the announced quantity, {{have a significant impact on}} the price of at least one of the following instruments: a three-month bill, a two-year note, a 10 -year note, and a 30 -year bond. These effects vary significantly according to maturity. Public news can explain a substantial fraction of price volatility in the aftermath of announcements, and the adjustment to news generally occurs within one minute after the announcement. We document significant and persistent increases in volatility and trading volume after the announcements. Bid-ask spreads, on the other hand, widen at the time of the announcements, but then revert to normal values after five to 15 minutes. The effects that we document have relevant implications for yield curve modeling and for the microstructure of bond markets. I...|$|R
