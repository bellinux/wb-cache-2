25|$|The <b>Double</b> <b>Cone</b> Trek was {{conceived}} in 1966 by Camp Director Chet Frisbie and Program Director Red Bryan. They sent three summer camp staff and Eagle Scouts—Bill Roberts, Terry Trotter, and Martin Woodward—to {{check out a}} multi-day hike around the camp. Roberts secured a measuring wheel from the Sierra Club. Trotter conducted nature surveys, noting the various flora and fauna at campsites, and took photographs. Woodward was tasked with noting all the campsite amenities or lack thereof, and all three brainstormed about the merit badges that might be worked on during the trek. The hike circles the Boy Scout camp, beginning at Bottcher's Gap, eastward around the Ventana <b>Double</b> <b>Cone</b> though Hiding Canyon and over the Pine Ridge Trail, west over the Big Sur River to Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park, and then back east through Pico Blanco Public Camp to the Boy Scout camp.

40|$|<b>Double</b> <b>cones</b> {{of birds}} are photoreceptors {{associated}} with motion perception, and perceiving motion is highly important to detect predators. Predation risks varies between habitats and may impose selective pressures {{that could affect}} organisms’ traits. There is evidence that birds show interspecific variations in visual system properties, such as the photoreceptor densities (single and <b>double</b> <b>cones)</b> and distribution across the retina. However, {{little is known about}} the relationship between the distribution of <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> and predator scanning strategies in birds living in different habitats. The goal of this study was to compare <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> distributions of birds that live in open vs. closed habitats. We measured the density and distribution of <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> in 2 species of the order Passeriformes. We found that the density of <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> in both species (open and closed habitat) is greater in the retina dorsal region. This result suggests that other visual traits might be taken into account in future work to better elucidate the relationship between habitat type and sensing motion. Moreover, the White-throated Sparrow had a more homogeneous distribution of <b>double</b> <b>cones,</b> result expected for this closed habitat species. Future work is suggested to be done using more individuals and more species to assess fully understand the evolution of predator- prey interactions and learn how prey can optimize vigilance strategies in different habitats with different predation pressure...|$|R

40|$|The retinae of many {{bird species}} contain a {{depression}} with high photoreceptor density {{known as the}} fovea. Many species of raptors have two foveae, a deep central fovea and a shallower temporal fovea. Birds have six types of photoreceptors: rods, active in dim light, <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> that are thought to mediate achromatic discrimination, and four types of single cones mediating color vision. To maximize visual acuity, the fovea should only contain photoreceptors contributing to high-resolution vision. Interestingly, {{it has been suggested}} that raptors might lack <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> in the fovea. We used transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry to evaluate this claim in five raptor species: the common buzzard (Buteo buteo), the honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus), the Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), the red kite (Milvus milvus), and the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). We found that all species, except the Eurasian sparrowhawk, lack <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> in the center of the central fovea. The size of the double cone-free zone differed between species. Only the common buzzard had a double cone-free zone in the temporal fovea.

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the morphology of these photoreceptors and their synaptic interconnection with bipolar cells and horizontal cells in the outer plexiform layer (OPL). Here we showed that glutamate antibodies labeled all photoreceptors and recoverin antibodies strongly labeled all cones and weakly labeled all rods. Antibodies against calbindin selectively stained accessory members of <b>double</b> <b>cones.</b> Antibodies against S-cone opsin stained small rods, a subpopulation of small single cones, and the outer segments of accessory <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> and a subtype of unidentified single cones. On average, large rods and small S-cone opsin positive rods accounted for 98. 6 % and 1. 4 % of all rods, respectively. Large/small <b>cones,</b> principle/accessory <b>double</b> <b>cones,</b> S-cone opsin positive small single cones, and S-cone opsin positive unidentified single cones accounted for about 66. 9 %, 23 %, 4. 5 %, and 5. 6 % of the total cones, respectively. Moreover, the differential connection between rods/cones and bipolar/horizontal cells and the wide distribution of AMPA receptor subunits GluR 2 / 3 and GluR 4 at the rod/cone synapses were observed. These results provide anatomical evidence for the physiological findings that bipolar/horizontal cells in the salamander retina are driven by rod/cone inputs of different weights, and that AMPA receptors play an important role in glutamatergic neurotransmission at the first visual synapses. The different photoreceptors selectively contacting bipolar and horizontal cells support the idea that visual signals may be conveyed to the inner retina by different functional pathways in the outer retina...|$|R
