25|$|In {{the words}} of soprano Montserrat Caballé:She opened a new door for us, for all the singers in the world, a door that had been closed. Behind it was {{sleeping}} not only great music but great idea of interpretation. She has <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> chance, those who follow her, {{to do things that}} were hardly possible before her. That I am compared with Callas is something I never dared to dream. It is not right. I am much smaller than Callas.|$|E
25|$|I {{want to say}} at {{once that}} I frankly believe that Irving Berlin is the {{greatest}} songwriter that has ever lived.... His songs are exquisite cameos of perfection, and {{each one of them}} is as beautiful as its neighbor. Irving Berlin remains, I think, America's Schubert. But apart from his genuine talent for song-writing, Irving Berlin has had a greater influence upon American music than any other one man. It was Irving Berlin who was the very first to have created a real, inherent American music.... Irving Berlin was the first to free the American song from the nauseating sentimentality which had previously characterized it, and by introducing and perfecting ragtime he had actually <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> first germ of an American musical idiom; he had sown the first seeds of an American music.|$|E

Time cannot dim our remembrance of them, nor lessen our {{gratitude}} to our Allies, who have <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> land in which many of them lie buried, so that we can care for their graves for ever. This was followed by the laying of a wreath, the dedication by the Dean, the hymn O Valiant Hearts (a war poem set to music to remember the fallen of the Great War), prayers, the first verse of the National Anthem, and the closing blessing. After the Prince and the Prime Ministers had left, the Abbey was opened to allow those waiting outside to join the rest of the congregation in viewing the memorial.|$|E

500|$|Both McWhorter and scholar Hilton Als found Angelou's writing {{throughout}} her series self-important. [...] Although McWhorter has admitted to being charmed by Angelou's sense of authority she has inserted into her works, {{which he calls}} her [...] "black-mother wit", he considered Angelou's autobiographies after Caged Bird [...] "smug", and has stated that she [...] "implicitly dares the reader to question her private line to God and Truth". [...] Als agreed, stating what made Song different from her preceding volumes is her [...] "ever-increasing unreliability". [...] Als stated that Angelou, in her six autobiographies, [...] "has <b>given</b> <b>us...</b> <b>the</b> self-aggrandizing, homespun, and sometimes oddly prudish story of a black woman who, {{when faced with the}} trials of life, simply makes do". Als believed that Angelou's essays, written in the 1990s, were a better culmination of her work as an autobiographer.|$|E

Winning just wasn't an option." [...] Lamine himself had earlier stated that the party should have carried the trial to the European Court of Human Rights, but Vlaams Blok senator Joris Van Hauthem had already stated in 2005, that; [...] "If we had gone to Strasbourg [...] based on procedural arguments, we {{might have had a}} case. But Lamine already put in a private claim to overturn the Appeals Court verdict, on the basis of substantive arguments.

2500|$|One area of {{research}} featuring nanobiotechnology is the extracellular matrices of cells (ECM). The ECM is primarily composed of interwoven fibers of collagen and elastin that have diameters ranging from 10–300nm. [...] In addition to holding the cell in place, the ECM {{has a variety of}} other functions including providing a point of attachment for the ECM of other cells and transmembrane receptors that are essential for life. Until recently it has been nearly impossible to study the physical forces that help cells maintain their functionality, but nanobiotechnology has <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> ability to learn more about these interactions. Using the unique properties of nanoparticles, it is possible to control how the nanoparticles adhere to certain patterns present in the ECM, and as a result can understand how changes in the ECM's shape can affect cell functionality.|$|E

His comments included innuendo and double entendres, like [...] "Samantha likes nothing better than a little potter in the woodshed in the morning". During early episodes of Samantha's appearance on the show, it was not completely clear {{that she was a}} fictional character, garnering complaints about the sexist and humiliating treatment she received. Producer Jon Naismith recalled [...] "when we [...] took over the show we used to get quite a few letters accusing us of sexist references to Samantha" [...] (the character was named after the page 3 topless model Samantha Fox). Samantha's inabilities as score-keeper often form the basis for humour; in a programme from 1997, Humph said: [...] "It's just occurred to me that Samantha hasn't <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> score... since 1981." ...|$|E

Mexican referee Benito Archundia and his linesmen {{did not believe the}} ball had passed the line, and no goal was awarded. The game resulted in a last minute 1–1 draw, shocking the French. French coach Raymond Domenech believed that France [...] "scored a second time, but the referee did not recognize that." [...] Television replays showed that the goal should have been awarded. French player Thierry Henry claimed the team was [...] "really upset" [...] when they saw the ball had passed the goal-line as [...] "if he (the referee) had <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> valid goal, that would not have offered the Koreans the opportunity to come back into the match." [...] However, {{it should also be noted}} that the corner kick leading to the header should have been a goal kick, as the ball had gone out of bounds off a French player. [...] In addition, there appeared to be a whistle on the play for a foul on France, which would have negated the goal anyway.|$|E

Patrick Mulkern praised Sarah Dollard's writing of the Doctor in [...] "Thin Ice", noting how she [...] "examines his moral code; the ideals he aspires to and the crimes and misdemeanors he's prepared to indulge". Capaldi's performance in [...] "Extremis" [...] received praise, with Alasdair Wilkins stating [...] "Peter Capaldi is perilously close to becoming my unqualified pick for favorite Doctor, he underplays the moment, making small choices to signal both his compassion and his heartbreak". He also praised the interactions between him and Missy, noting how they recall [...] "a more emotionally complex version of the repartee that Jon Pertwee’s Doctor and Roger Delgado’s Master had during their many encounters". Patrick Mulkern praised Capaldi’s performance in [...] "The Lie of the Land" [...] proclaiming [...] "he wavers between downright nasty and at best disconcerting. He’s world-weary — specifically, Earth-weary. You can almost believe he’s working for the dark side, so great is his disenchantment with the human race". After the broadcast of World Enough and Time, Steven Moffat paid a special tribute to Capaldi, “Peter only has to think at the screen and you know what he’s thinking,” he said. “He only has to move his face and I know the particular blend of Scottish torment he’s feeling right now. Despite trying to fight his emotions, he has <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> most emotional Doctor.” [...] Capaldi received overwhelming praise for his performance in [...] "The Doctor Falls" [...] with Patrick Mulkern noted the episode as a story dedicated to the character and how he [...] "stands tall", along with Daniel Jackson of the Daily Mirror highlighting the twelfth Doctor, praising how he [...] "simply shines". Flickering Myth stated [...] "Peter Capaldi is a magnificent Doctor, a person who captures the wisdom, madness, caring and frustration of a two-thousand year old Time Lord". Digital Spy praised Capaldi's [...] "Where I stand is where I fall" [...] speech, noting it as quite possibly the actor's finest moment to date. Simon Brew of Den of Geek heavily praised the actor's performance stating: [...] "The majestic, wonderful, brilliant Peter Capaldi. If you needed a reminder of just how much he’s going to be missed when he finally departs Doctor Who {{at the end of the}} year, his outstanding work here was precisely that. When he was blasted, apparently mortally, and he kept holding off his regeneration I found myself saying out loud “I don’t want you to go”". Ross Ruediger of New York Magazine agreed, admitting that [...] "the man’s been a revelation. I love Peter Capaldi. He has without a doubt been my Doctor for this new incarnation of Doctor Who that’s wrapping up its tenth season, and we have been nothing short of fortunate to have been blessed with his talents. I don’t want you to go either, Peter".|$|E
