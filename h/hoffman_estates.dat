5|$|Bound for Glory IV was a {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion that took place on October12, 2008 at the Sears Centre in <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates,</b> Illinois. It was the fourth event under the Bound for Glory name and the tenth event in the 2008 TNA PPV schedule. The show was promoted as TNA's premier PPV event and their equivalent to the rival World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) WrestleMania. Eight professional wrestling matches and one untelevised match were featured on the event's card, four of which were for championships.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the current}} {{lack of an}} Olympic stadium, Chicago has dozens of {{existing}} sport venues: Soldier Field, United Center, U.S. Cellular Field, Wrigley Field, Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Sears Centre in <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates,</b> and Toyota Park in Bridgeview. Venues at Loyola University Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago State University, Northern Illinois University, and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, among others, were also available and had been mentioned in early news reports as possibilities. Northerly Island and the lakefront along Lake Michigan would have hosted all beach and water events. The McCormick Place convention center, the second largest in the world, was the planned venue for indoor events like judo and weightlifting, as well as hosting all press offices, while Archery and the medals podium were slated for Grant Park.|$|E
5|$|Bound for Glory IV {{took place}} on October 12, 2008 at the Sears Centre in <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates,</b> Illinois, where it {{featured}} eight professional wrestling matches. The maximum capacity of the Sears Centre is about 11,800, however, only 5,000 were in attendance for the event. All four of TNA's active championships {{at the time were}} defended at the event. The main event featured Sting defeating TNA World Heavyweight Champion Samoa Joe to become the new champion. Another featured match was Jeff Jarrett versus Kurt Angle with Mick Foley as the Special Guest Enforcer, which Jarrett won. Other matches on the card included a Four-Way Tag Team Monster's Ball match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship with Steve McMichael as the Special Guest Referee, which was won by Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm), who were accompanied by Jacqueline, over the teams of Abyss and Matt Morgan, Brother Ray and Brother Devon—known as Team 3D—and The Latin American Xchange (Homicide and Hernandez); a match involving three competitors, also known as a 3-Way Dance or a Three Way match, resulting in Booker T defeating Christian Cage and A.J. Styles; and Sheik Abdul Bashir defeating Consequences Creed to retain the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
50|$|Rogers Peet Building was a five-story {{structure}} {{which was}} built in Manhattan in 1863 in City Hall Park. It was home to the Rogers Peet clothing store until December 4, 1898. It belonged to the Emanuel <b>Hoffman</b> <b>estate</b> {{and was one of}} the historic buildings of New York City. The edifice, located at Broadway and Warren Street, burned entirely during a fire which accounted for more than $1,000,000 in property losses.|$|R
50|$|Lilliana Hoffman dies in a {{carriage}} {{accident in the}} woods, caused by wolves that attack both the horses and the coachman. Her husband Fredric, at his dying wife's urging, reluctantly performs a caesarean section to save their unborn daughter. Years later, the young Lilli Hoffman, named after her dead mother, plays mischievously {{on the grounds of}} the <b>Hoffman</b> <b>estate.</b> Fredric remarries a noble woman named Lady Claudia. Despite Claudia's kindness to her, Lilli is jealous and resentful towards her new stepmother.On the Hoffmans' wedding night, Lilli runs from her nursemaid and hides under Claudia's bed. However the nursemaid is mysteriously killed by an unseen force when she looks into Claudia's mirror.|$|R
50|$|Salter Path {{was passed}} from John A. Royal to Alice Green Hoffman, a distant {{relative}} of Theodore Roosevelt and daughter of Alfred Green, {{a former governor}} of New Jersey. Alice <b>Hoffman</b> developed an <b>estate</b> in present day Pine Knoll Shores and sued the residents of Salter Path in 1923 because their cows were wandering onto her estate. A subsequent court decision permitted the residents of Salter Path to remain, but the cows {{were not allowed to}} graze on the <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estate.</b> The village was restricted to 81 acre that the squatters occupied, and direct ownership of the beachfront was granted to the village to use collectively. This ruling further stated that only current residents and descendents could occupy the property, but it did not give any individuals title to the land. This ruling remained intact until 1979 when a legal settlement permitted Salter Path residents to hold a title to their property and for Carteret County to levy taxes on the former squatter's village.|$|R
25|$|The {{owner of}} Kmart, Sears Holdings Corporation, {{has had its}} {{headquarters}} in <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates,</b> Illinois just outside of Chicago since 1993 when it {{moved out of the}} Sears Tower in downtown Chicago. Kmart has been in the <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> Headquarters since Kmart bought Sears in 2004.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> v. The Flipside, <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates,</b> Inc., , is a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} {{concerning the}} vagueness and overbreadth doctrines as {{they apply to}} restrictions on commercial speech. The justices unanimously upheld an ordinance passed by a Chicago suburb that imposed licensing requirements {{on the sale of}} drug paraphernalia by a local record store. Their decision overturned the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> guided many {{lower courts}} {{considering}} similar cases, {{but it did}} not guarantee the same result. Where no distinction between the challenged ordinance or statute and the one at issue in <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> could be made, the governments prevailed, as in Stoianoff v. Montana, a Ninth Circuit case early in 1983. However, in late 1983, an Ohio district judge threw out a similar ordinance from West Carrollton because it had failed to include any guidelines.|$|E
50|$|James Deering built Villa Vizcaya between 1914 and 1922 with visionary {{mastermind of}} the project, {{designer}} Paul Chalfin, his collaborator companion. The architect was F. Burrall <b>Hoffman</b> Jr.. The <b>estate's</b> landscape master plan and formal gardens were designed by Colombian landscape designer Diego Suarez. Paul Chalfin had attended Harvard, trained as a painter at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and was an associate of renowned decorator Elsie de Wolfe. She introduced Chalfin to Deering for the interiors of his Chicago home in 1910. In 1910, Chalfin and Deering traveled through Europe {{together for the first}} trip of many over the years, in part to collect ideas and begin acquiring art, antiquities, and furnishings for the new Florida estate. The culmination of their shared effort and lasting memorial to their creative relationship is Villa Vizcaya, the Miami estate created between 1914 and 1923.|$|R
25|$|The city {{appealed to}} the Fifth Circuit. In 2008 a panel ruled in its favor on all the issues. Carolyn Dineen King, writing for the court, cited <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> as laying the {{procedure}} for a facial vagueness challenge.|$|E
25|$|Kmart was {{headquartered}} in Troy until it acquired Sears in 2005, establishing {{itself in the}} former Sears headquarters in <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates,</b> Illinois. Its massive headquarters still remains, though it was scheduled for demolition {{and the creation of}} a landscaped square with boulevards lined with upscale shops, restaurants, offices, a theater, and condominiums, but those plans collapsed in the recession.|$|E
25|$|Back on the Seventh Circuit, {{two more}} cases decided shortly after <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> {{considered}} {{two different types}} of ordinances in light of that holding. One, Levas and Levas v. Village of Antioch, concerned the model DEA ordinance, passed by another Illinois community. The other, Record Head Corp. v. Sachen, turned on a West Allis, Wisconsin, ordinance that carried criminal penalties.|$|E
25|$|Kmart's world {{headquarters}} {{were located in}} Troy, Michigan, in Metro Detroit. Subsequent to {{the completion of the}} purchase of Sears, headquarters have been located in <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates,</b> Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. An independent entity calling itself Kmart operates in Australia and New Zealand (see Kmart Australia) but it no longer has any relation to the American stores except in name.|$|E
25|$|West Allis's {{ordinance}} {{focused on}} curbing drug paraphernalia sales to minors. Not only were such sales forbidden, all paraphernalia sales within {{a thousand feet}} (305 m) of a school. It also required that paraphernalia be displayed only in portions of stores not visible to minors and where they could only go if accompanied by a parent or guardian. Unlike <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates,</b> West Allis provided for criminal penalties, with fines and jail time.|$|E
25|$|Changes {{in society}} since <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> were {{reflected}} in, Roark & Hardee L.P. et al v. City of Austin, {{the most recent}} case to rely on it as a significant precedent. In a 2005 referendum, the voters of Austin, Texas, approved a smoking ban in indoor public places within the city. The plaintiffs, owners of several city bars, filed suit in the Western District of Texas seeking to have the ordinance overturned on several grounds, including vagueness.|$|E
25|$|The village's {{attorney}} {{determined that}} two businesses in <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> {{were affected by}} the ordinance. One of them, the Flipside, had been doing business on West Higgins Road in the village for three years, selling primarily recorded music and accessories for that, as well as jewelry and novelty devices. In {{one section of the}} store it sold paraphernalia, accompanied by books such as A Child's Garden of Grass and Marijuana Grower's Guide and magazines like High Times, Rolling Stone and National Lampoon, which often carried articles either discussing drug culture or casually depicting illegal drug use.|$|E
25|$|The Sears Holdings Corporation is an American {{holding company}} {{headquartered}} in <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates,</b> Illinois, {{a suburb of}} Chicago. It {{is the owner of}} retail store brands Sears and Kmart, and was founded after the latter purchased the former in 2005. Sears Holdings also owns the brands Kenmore and DieHard. A sale of Craftsman to Stanley Black and Decker occurred in March of 2017. Sears retains the rights to sell Craftsman tools for 15 years from the date of sale through the purchase of tools from their established suppliers. Sears Holdings operates 1,503 retail locations under the mastheads of Sears, Kmart, and their subsidiaries, such as auto centers and pharmacies, in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and Guam. As of 2014, it is the 18th-largest retailing company in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Concerned {{that the}} sale of items such as bongs and rolling papers, along with books and {{magazines}} devoted to the era's drug culture promoted and encouraged illegal recreational drug use, {{the board of trustees}} of the village of <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates,</b> Illinois, passed an ordinance requiring that vendors of drug paraphernalia obtain a license to do so, as they lacked the power to ban their sale outright. As a condition of that license, they were required to keep a record of the name and address of anyone buying such items for inspection by the police at any time. One of the two stores it applied to, The Flipside, filed suit in federal court for the Northern District of Illinois, seeking to have the ordinance invalidated, claiming its scope was so wide and overbroad as to possibly prevent the store from selling the books and magazines, thus infringing its First Amendment rights.|$|E
500|$|Moskowitz {{found the}} Supreme Court's {{decision}} in <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> v. The Flipside relevant to his analysis. There, the Court had reversed the Seventh Circuit and upheld a local ordinance imposing {{restrictions on the}} sale of drug paraphernalia. Like the SFPA, Moskowitz observed, that ordinance, too, had been enforced only with civil penalties, and was primarily an economic regulation aimed at business activity, which businesses can reasonably be expected to study and prepare for. [...] "Accordingly, the SFPA provisions do not merit strict scrutiny for vagueness." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the first}} day of 2008, TNA updated their {{official}} website to publicize the official dates for all of their PPV events to take place later that year. The next installment in the Bound for Glory chronology was listed as being scheduled for October 12, 2008. The location for the show was revealed via a press release on June 9, 2008 that the Sears Centre located in <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates,</b> a suburb of Chicago, Illinois, was where it would be hailing from. The press release also announced that a Total Nonstop InterAction event was set to take place on October 11, that tickets for the event would go on sale August 1, 2008, and that the official title of the event was [...] "Bound for Glory IV", meaning this was the first Bound for Glory event to feature Roman numerals in its title. The song Tarantula by the alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins was used as the official theme song of the show.|$|E
500|$|Bound for Glory was {{the twelfth}} of the {{thirteen}} event titles Impact Wrestling has produced under. Each event {{consist of a}} main event and an undercard that feature championship matches and other various matches. The first event was held in October 2005. There have been a total of eight events under the chronology to take place as of [...] The 2006 edition was the first [...] Impact Wrestling (then TNA) three-hour monthly PPV event to take place outside of the TNA Impact! Zone at the Compuware Sports Arena in Plymouth Township, Michigan. The Impact! Zone is a sound stage owned by Universal Studios and operated within Universal Studios Florida; it is the home to Impact Wrestling's primary television program of the same name, from which the soundstage gets its name, and is where Impact Wrestling holds most of it events. In 2007, TNA held Bound for Glory again outside of the Impact! Zone, this time in Duluth, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta, at the Gwinnett Center on October 14, 2007. This trait continued into 2008 at Bound for Glory IV, which {{took place at the}} Sears Centre in <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates,</b> Illinois on October 12. Bound for Glory IV was also the first event under the chronology to have Roman numerals featured in its title.|$|E
500|$|The fourth {{installment}} {{under the}} Bound for Glory name {{was announced in}} January 2008 with an October12 date attached. TNA issued a mobile alert in March 2008 that the top three candidate cities to host the event were New York City, Toronto, and Chicago. TNA President Dixie Carter {{was quoted as saying}} that Chicago had been chosen as the location. The main event was planned to be Samoa Joe versus Kevin Nash before TNA management chose to go in a different direction. TNA issued a press release on June9 regarding Bound for Glory, announcing it would be held at the Sears Centre in <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates,</b> Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. It was also revealed that the event was officially stylized as [...] "Bound for Glory IV," [...] tickets went on sale August1, and TNA had scheduled a [...] "Total Nonstop InterAction" [...] event on October11. Early returns for ticket sales revealed that the first two tiers had been sold out. In previous installments, the purchasing price of the event was $29.99, but with Bound for Glory IV TNA increased the price to $34.99. TNA advertised recently signed wrestler Mick Foley for their Total Nonstop InterAction event held at the Hyatt Regency in Rosemont, Illinois, with it selling out shortly afterwards. The Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that TNA had received the largest crowd for a Total Nonstop InterAction event up to that point. TNA originally planned to use former professional football player and professional wrestler Steve McMichael as a Special Ringside Enforcer before management changed their minds and decided to use Mick Foley in the role instead. TNA later issued a press release announcing that McMichael would take part in the Bound for Glory IV festivities as a Special Guest Referee due to his fame and connection to the Chicago Bears and Chicago in general.|$|E
2500|$|The same three-judge panel, {{consisting}} of circuit chief judge [...] Walter J. Cummings, Jr., Circuit judge Wilbur Frank Pell, Jr. and William G. East, a senior {{judge of the}} District of Oregon sitting by designation, heard both cases but deferred deciding them while <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> was pending. Afterwards, it asked all parties for fresh briefs on their positions taking the decision into account, and announced both decisions on the same day, four months after <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... who {{received}} 40 percent, and Wheaton College professor Lindy Scott, {{who received}} 16 percent. Duckworth is {{a resident of}} <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates,</b> Illinois. Although part of <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> is within the sixth district, Duckworth lives three miles outside of the district. She lives in a disabled-accessible house which was refitted for her access by friends. [...] The U.S. Constitution requires only that a member, when elected, be [...] "an inhabitant {{of the state in}} which he shall be chosen." [...] Illinois does not have a district residency requirement.|$|E
2500|$|Both <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> and West Allis {{had sought}} to {{overcome}} that issue by a licensing scheme and a geographical limit to the prohibition, respectively. But [...] "hese legislative strategies do not really solve the problem," [...] Cummings observed, {{as it was the}} definition of paraphernalia that was still the fundamental issue in a vagueness review.|$|E
2500|$|Barrington {{is part of}} the Chicago {{metropolitan}} area and serves as the hub of activity for the surrounding [...] region which consists of six independent villages including North Barrington, South Barrington, Barrington Hills, Lake Barrington and Tower Lakes, as well as small portions of Carpentersville, Deer Park, <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates,</b> and Inverness. [...] The village's motto is [...] "a great place to live, work, and play!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I simply fail to comprehend," [...] Pell continued, [...] "the {{reasoning}} of {{the majority}} that the phrase 'intended for use' is broader than 'marketed for use' and therefore somehow becomes vague, although 'marketed for use' is 'transparently clear' with regard to intention," [...] as the Supreme Court had written. In fact, he remarked, <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> treated the two phrases as more or less identical, since marketing for a use implied an intention for that use.|$|E
2500|$|In Levas, two {{brothers}} {{who ran a}} T-shirt shop in Antioch challenged that village's ordinance. Writing for himself and East, Cummings admitted that due to {{the difference in the}} ordinances <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> was not controlling precedent, as the village had argued. But, he reminded the Levases, [...] " [...] also sets important limits on facial constitutional attacks in the drug paraphernalia area, and is therefore not so distinguishable as [...] would have us believe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Next, King {{considered}} {{whether the}} ordinance was vague {{in all its}} possible applications. She held it significant that the guidelines had been drawn up by the city in response to business concerns, giving it a point of similarity with the <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> ordinance and the Court's holding {{that the ability to}} clarify justified a less strict vagueness standard. But [...] "to be safe", she wrote, the court was applying the stricter standards for criminal ordinances.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates,</b> Pell {{began his}} dissent, [...] "the Court seemed {{to put to}} rest the idea that {{municipalities}} could not, in an endeavor to retard the growing menace of drug abuse, legislate against {{the activities of the}} so-called head shops without running afoul of Constitutional prohibitions." [...] He felt that {{the differences between the two}} ordinances were [...] "matters of form rather than substance ... he majority opinion appears to be straining unduly to distinguish [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|As of 2011 {{there is}} a Japanese {{community}} in Arlington Heights, near Chicago. Jay Shimotake, {{the president of the}} Mid America Japanese Club, an organization located in Arlington Heights, said [...] "Arlington Heights is a very convenient location, and Japanese people in the business environment know it's a nice location surrounding O'Hare airport." [...] The Chicago Futabakai Japanese School is located in Arlington Heights. The Mitsuwa Marketplace, a shopping center owned by Japanese, opened around 1981. Many Japanese companies have their US headquarters in nearby <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> and Schaumburg.|$|E
2500|$|Pell {{called the}} West Allis {{ordinance}} [...] "a sensible and pragmatic approach, within constitutional limitations." [...] While the majority {{had used a}} higher standard of review owing to the criminal nature of the ordinance, he reminded them that the Court had called the <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> ordinance [...] "quasi-criminal" [...] and held it to the same higher standard. It had approved it, and [...] "he same result, in my opinion, is necessary here." [...] To him, the majority's distinction of the West Allis ordinance as reaching beyond economic or business activity missed the point: ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{is clear}} that the opinion in <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> {{establishes}} a method—though it does not necessarily dictate a result—for judging the facial constitutionality of all such ordinances," [...] Cummings wrote. After reiterating the Court's holding that the overbreadth doctrine did not reach commercial speech, he moved on to the vagueness question. West Allis's ordinance demanded [...] "a somewhat more searching examination," [...] due to the criminal penalties involved, although he admitted the Supreme Court had treated Hoffman Estates' ordinance as [...] "quasi-criminal." [...] West Allis's also governed paraphernalia transactions between individuals, further heightening the standard of review.|$|E
2500|$|Construction of {{the center}} is {{expected}} to be completed in 2020 or 2021. The architects said in February 2017 that [...] construction {{of the center}}'s library and museum would likely approach $300 million, and that the center would likely need an endowment of $1.5 billion. Until the site is ready, papers and artifacts from the Obama administration are being stored and processed inside a facility in <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates,</b> northwest of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. Obama did not do major fundraising for the center while still in office. In 2017, Obama reportedly was set to engage in a major fundraising effort for the center.|$|E
2500|$|Outside {{the wave}} of drug-paraphernalia {{ordinances}} and statutes challenged in federal courts in its wake, <b>Hoffman</b> <b>Estates</b> has not been significantly revisited by courts at any level, though it has {{played a significant role}} in some later analyses outside that area. The Colorado Supreme Court clarified what it called [...] "the Flipside test" [...] for determining the standard of a vagueness review in its 1988 case Parrish v. Lamm. There, two chiropractors had challenged a new state law criminalizing as [...] "abuse of health care" [...] the practice by some health care providers of waiving a patient's health insurance copayment and/or deductible, or advertising that they did so.|$|E
