5000|$|The {{company was}} founded by Theophile Mortier (1855-1944). Mortier started in 1898 as a vending agent for the Parisian organ builder <b>Gavioli</b> & Cie, in a period when the French and German organ {{industry}} was in full bloom. Theophile Mortier was originally {{the manager of a}} dance hall, in which there was always a <b>Gavioli</b> organ playing. He made it a habit to sell the installed organ after a short while. He was fortunate enough most of the time to make a profit on selling these used organs. As time went by he became more and more an organ dealer and a very good customer of <b>Gavioli.</b> He set up a repair shop in order to provide maintenance and repair for the organs, which he had sold. The organ builder Guillaume Bax managed this shop. In 1906 Mortier started to build organs himself, as an annex of the <b>Gavioli</b> company.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Gavioli</b> {{was founded}} in 1806 in Modena, Italy, by Giacomo <b>Gavioli</b> (1786-1875). Giacamo's hobby was the {{development}} of automatic playing musical instruments like bird organs and flute clocks. His son Anselmo was a very clever inventor; he built a large orchestrion organ the [...] "Panharmonico" [...] for the Duke of Modena, who refused to buy the instrument. Ludovico then took it to London and Paris. In 1852 Ludovico <b>Gavioli</b> (1807-1875) moved the business to the trade capital of the organ trade, Paris, France. From 1858 on he started his own organ building company in the Rue d'Aligre. Ludovico had three sons: Anselme, Henry and Claude.|$|E

5000|$|Charles Marengi {{started his}} career working in the famous organ factory of <b>Gavioli</b> & Cie in Paris. By 1900, he was chief of the <b>Gavioli</b> workshops. After {{troubles}} between the associates he decided {{to start his own}} business in 1903, in the former <b>Gavioli</b> factory at the Avenue de Taillebourg near the Place de la Nation in Paris. His products had a strong resemblance to Gavioli's organs; however, Marenghi added several inventions of his own, like the [...] "Grélotophone", a register of tuned sleighbells for which he was granted a patent in 1914. He sold many fairground organs, especially to the UK, where some of his best instruments may still be seen and heard.|$|E
5000|$|In 1907, the {{economic}} crisis in the USA severely affected the export market of <b>Gavioli</b> in the German Black Forest town of Waldkirch, centre of the German fairground organ industry, {{with the result that}} <b>Gavioli</b> ceased trading there. This allowed Limonaire the opportunity {{to be able to take}} over the premises and remaining stock in 1908, and business became successful enough that a new factory was built on land previously owned by Richard Bruder in 1912. Many organs were produced by Limonaire in these years, under the [...] "Orchestronphone" [...] trade name, often incorporating a bioscope. In the heyday of La Belle Époque, only the other Parisian firm of <b>Gavioli</b> was larger.|$|E
50|$|In 1994 works {{began on}} what {{developed}} {{to be the}} maestro’s life masterpiece, combining the feel of local cultures with stories of Charles Baudelaire, Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Due to its significance, the IRWIN artist group, part of Neue Slowenische Kunst movement, suggested {{the name of the}} new venue to be Ambasada <b>Gavioli</b> (Embassy of <b>Gavioli).</b> It opened in December 1995.|$|E
5000|$|In 1892, organ maker Anselmo <b>Gavioli</b> {{patented}} the [...] "book organ," [...] with {{a series}} of folded sheets of cardboard. Holes punched on the pages of the folded book allowed air to pass through, to make the pipes of the organ sound. [...] The development marked {{a turning point in the}} history of the mechanical organ, and made <b>Gavioli,</b> until their demise in 1910, the most famous and prolific fair-organ builders.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gavioli</b> & Cie were a Franco-Italian organ builder {{company that}} {{manufactured}} fairground organs in both Italy and later France.|$|E

50|$|The dance organ {{came into}} its own during the early 1900s, with many large {{instruments}} built by <b>Gavioli</b> and Marenghi. In the early 1910s the firm of Mortier began expanding out the sound-schemes of these instruments {{with a variety of}} novel and new pipework and percussion adapted to the new emerging styles of early 20th century popular music. Other manufacturers such as Hooghuys and Fasano followed suit. Many instruments with older style sound schemes from <b>Gavioli</b> and Marenghi were modernized by Mortier and others either partially or entirely.|$|E
