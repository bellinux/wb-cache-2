5|$|A {{variation}} of the spray transfer mode, pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat-affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces. The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second. However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> and can be used to weld thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E
5|$|When welding {{dissimilar}} metals, {{the joint}} {{must have an}} accurate fit, with proper gap dimensions and bevel angles. Care {{should be taken to}} avoid melting excessive base material. Pulsed current is particularly useful for these applications, as it helps limit the <b>heat</b> <b>input.</b> The filler metal should be added quickly, and a large weld pool should be avoided to prevent dilution of the base materials.|$|E
5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E

Welding was done parallel to the rolling direction. TMCP steels are designed to tolerate high <b>heat</b> <b>inputs,</b> as the carbon content is reduced. Therefore, welding processes with low <b>heat</b> <b>inputs,</b> such as MMA, will also show appropriate outcomes, if SAW process results are successful.|$|R

The effects of flow velocity, exponential period and tube inner diameter on transient turbulent heat transfer process were discussed in detail. It was clarified that the transient turbulent heat transfer due to exponentially increasing <b>heat</b> <b>inputs</b> could be analyzed by introducing a dimensionless time, Fourier number, Fo.

5|$|In GMAW {{the primary}} cause of {{porosity}} is gas entrapment in the weld pool, which occurs when the metal solidifies before the gas escapes. The gas can come from impurities in the shielding gas or on the workpiece, as well as from an excessively long or violent arc. Generally, the amount of gas entrapped {{is directly related to the}} cooling rate of the weld pool. Because of its higher thermal conductivity, aluminum welds are especially susceptible to greater cooling rates and thus additional porosity. To reduce it, the workpiece and electrode should be clean, the welding speed diminished and the current set high enough to provide sufficient <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> and stable metal transfer but low enough that the arc remains steady. Preheating can also help reduce the cooling rate in some cases by reducing the temperature gradient between the weld area and the base material.|$|E
5|$|Spray {{transfer}} GMAW was {{the first}} metal transfer method used in GMAW, and well-suited to welding aluminium and stainless steel while employing an inert shielding gas. In this GMAW process, the weld electrode metal is rapidly passed along the stable electric arc from the electrode to the workpiece, essentially eliminating spatter and resulting in a high-quality weld finish. As the current and voltage increases beyond the range of short circuit transfer the weld electrode metal transfer transitions from larger globules through small droplets to a vaporized stream at the highest energies. Since this vaporized spray transfer variation of the GMAW weld process requires higher voltage and current than short circuit transfer, {{and as a result}} of the higher <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> and larger weld pool area (for a given weld electrode diameter), it is generally used only on workpieces of thicknesses above about 6.4mm (0.25in).|$|E
5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: So far {{empirical}} {{models have}} been mainly studied for real-time application of thermal error compensation scheme in machine tools. However, the empirical models are somewhat unreliable because they cannot estimate correctly for the untested conditions. This paper describes {{a new approach to}} estimate the unknown <b>heat</b> <b>inputs</b> and temperature distribution in real time based on an analytical model. A 1 -dimensional heat transfer problem is modeled with state space equations. And then observer is designed to estimate the intensity of heat source and the whole temperature field in real time using frequency domain approach and low pass filter. Thermal process is time-variant because parameters in thermal process are the function of temperature. So, a recursive parameter identification of adaptive algorithm is used to enhance the estimation accuracy of temperature distribution as well as <b>heat</b> <b>inputs.</b> To verify the reliability of the proposed real-time estimator, <b>heat</b> <b>inputs</b> and temperatures are estimated by observer and with measurements from two points of a ball screw system in case of the presence of measurement noise...|$|R

25|$|For any {{welding process}} it is, in general, {{desirable}} {{to increase the}} travel speed and minimise the <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> as this will increase productivity and possibly reduce the impact of welding on the mechanical properties of the weld.

25|$|In {{order to}} prevent tool {{fracture}} and to minimize excessive {{wear and tear on}} the tool and associated machinery, the welding cycle is modified so that the forces acting on the tool are as low as possible, and abrupt changes are avoided.

25|$|Like {{the steam}} engine, the Stirling engine is {{traditionally}} classified as an external combustion engine, as all heat transfers {{to and from}} the working fluid take place through a solid boundary (heat exchanger) thus isolating the combustion process and any contaminants it may produce from the working parts of the engine. This contrasts with an internal combustion engine where <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> is by combustion of a fuel within the body of the working fluid. Most of the many possible implementations of the Stirling engine fall into the category of reciprocating piston engine.|$|E
25|$|There are two tool speeds to be {{considered}} in friction-stir welding; how fast the tool rotates and how quickly it traverses along the interface. These two parameters have considerable importance and must be chosen with care to ensure a successful and efficient welding cycle. The relationship between the rotation speed, the welding speed and the <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> during welding is complex but, in general, {{it can be said that}} increasing the rotation speed or decreasing the traverse speed will result in a hotter weld. In order to produce a successful weld it is necessary that the material surrounding the tool is hot enough to enable the extensive plastic flow required and minimize the forces acting on the tool. If the material is too cold then voids or other flaws may be present in the stir zone and in extreme cases the tool may break.|$|E
40|$|AbstractHeat pipes come handy now-a-days as {{they operate}} with highest heat {{conductance}} compared {{to any other}} mode of heat transfer and available over wide range of parameters. In the present study de-ionized water flow in the plain thermo-syphon, Sintered Copper wick and Helical grooved heat pipes with simultaneous evaporation, adiabatic and condensation phenomenon are studied using Heat pipe test equipment. In this equipment a heat pipe subjected to a predetermine heat load by a resistance heater at its evaporator end and water jacket with controlled flow of water is employed to dissipate the heat energy at the condenser end. All the temperatures are measured and the required calculations are carried out to get percentage efficiencies at varying flow rates and <b>heat</b> <b>inputs.</b> The performance of heat pipes and comparison between their efficiencies is done. The sintered copper wick structure pipe have been found efficient {{when compared to other}} two with <b>heat</b> <b>inputs</b> starting from 50 to 200 watts because of predominating Capillarity property. Even the helical grooved heat pipe can also be used efficiently at the lower flow rates for power input ranging from 100 to 200 W.

500|$|The {{level of}} <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> also affects weld quality. [...] Low <b>heat</b> <b>input,</b> caused by low welding current or high welding speed, can limit {{penetration}} and cause the weld bead to lift {{away from the}} surface being welded. If {{there is too much}} <b>heat</b> <b>input,</b> however, the weld bead grows in width while the likelihood of excessive penetration and spatter increase. Additionally, if the welding torch is too far from the workpiece the shielding gas becomes ineffective, causing porosity within the weld. This results in a weld with pinholes, which is weaker than a typical weld.|$|E
500|$|The {{heat-affected zone}} (HAZ) is a ring {{surrounding}} the weld {{in which the}} temperature of the welding process, combined with the stresses of uneven heating and cooling, alter the heat-treatment properties of the alloy. The effects of welding on the material surrounding the weld can be detrimentalâdepending on the materials used and the <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> of the welding process used, the HAZ can be of varying size and strength. The thermal diffusivity of the base material plays a large roleâif the diffusivity is high, the material cooling rate is high and the HAZ is relatively small. Conversely, a low diffusivity leads to slower cooling and a larger HAZ. The amount of heat injected by the welding process plays an important role as well, as processes like oxyacetylene welding have an unconcentrated <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> and increase the size of the HAZ. Processes like laser beam welding give a highly concentrated, limited amount of heat, resulting in a small HAZ.

500|$|Most {{applications}} of {{gas metal arc}} welding use a constant voltage power supply. [...] As a result, any change in arc length (which is directly related to voltage) results in a large change in <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> and current. A shorter arc length causes a much greater <b>heat</b> <b>input,</b> which makes the wire electrode melt more quickly and thereby restore the original arc length. This helps operators keep the arc length consistent even when manually welding with hand-held welding guns. To achieve a similar effect, sometimes a constant current power source is used in combination with an arc voltage-controlled wire feed unit. [...] In this case, a change in arc length makes the wire feed rate adjust to maintain a relatively constant arc length. In rare circumstances, a constant current power source and a constant wire feed rate unit might be coupled, especially for the welding of metals with high thermal conductivities, such as aluminum.
