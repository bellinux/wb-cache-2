40|$|A {{technique}} {{was developed to}} allow the Aero Grid and Paneling System (AGPS), a geometry and visualization system, {{to be used as}} a dynamic real-time geometry monitor, manipulator, and interrogator for other codes. This technique involves the direct connection of AGPS with one or more external codes through the use of Unix pipes. AGPS has several commands that control communication with the <b>external</b> <b>program.</b> The <b>external</b> <b>program</b> uses several special subroutines that allow simple, direct communication with AGPS. The <b>external</b> <b>program</b> creates AGPS command lines and transmits the line over the pipes or communicates on a subroutine level. AGPS executes the commands, displays graphics/geometry information, and transmits the required solutions back to the <b>external</b> <b>program.</b> The basic ideas discussed in this paper could easily be implemented in other graphics/geometry systems currently in use or under development...|$|R
50|$|Amavis can use several <b>external</b> <b>programs</b> {{to enhance}} its functionality.These are de-archivers, de-compressors,virus {{scanners}} and spam scanners. As theseprograms are often implemented in languages like Cor C++, {{there is a}} potential risk that a mail message passed to one ofthese programs can cause its failure or even open a security hole. The riskis limited by running these programs as an unprivileged user ID, and possiblychroot-ed. Nevertheless, <b>external</b> <b>programs</b> like unmaintained de-archiversshould be avoided. The use of these <b>external</b> <b>programs</b> is configurable, andthey can be disabled selectively or as a group (like all decoders or allvirus scanners).|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{open and}} {{configurable}} applications, <b>external</b> <b>programs</b> {{are often used}} to handle different functions and data formats. This is particularly true for applications that communicate through the Internet, where new protocols and data formats are frequently introduced. These <b>external</b> <b>programs</b> are often installed quickly and without a full security auditing, even when the sources are available. This makes the users of such applications vulnerable to viruses and Trojan horses introduced by misconfiguration or flaws in the security of these applications...|$|R

40|$|Heterogeneous Reasoning and Mediator Systems (HERMES), first {{proposed}} by Lu, Nerode and Subrahmanian, {{may be used}} to access and logically integrate information from external databases and/or software packages using functions already defined in those domains. When processing queries in HERMES, we need to execute these <b>external</b> <b>programs,</b> and this is often an expensive process, especially when these programs are located at remote sites on, say a network. Consequently, the problem of minimizing access to such external routines without compromising completeness is an important one. In this paper, we will present methods to cache the results of previous computations and use the knowledge about <b>external</b> <b>programs</b> to make intelligent use of the cached information to reduce calls to <b>external</b> <b>programs.</b> 1 Introduction During the past few decades, the world has witnessed a spectacular explosion in the quantity of data available in one electronic form or another.
