A high level of technical competence is also indicated for the c. 280 ka blades recovered from the Kapthurin Formation, Kenya.|$|E
5|$|Operation Infinite Reach was the codename for American {{cruise missile}} strikes on al-Qaeda bases in Khost, Afghanistan, and the Al-Shifa {{pharmaceutical}} factory in Khartoum, Sudan, on August 20, 1998. The attacks, {{launched by the}} U.S. Navy, were ordered by President Bill Clinton in retaliation for al-Qaeda's August 7 bombings of American embassies <b>in</b> <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> Tanzania, which killed 224 people (including 12 Americans) and injured over 4,000 others. Operation Infinite Reach {{was the first time}} the United States acknowledged a preemptive strike against a violent non-state actor.|$|E

5|$|The park's Wildlife Conservation Education Centre has {{lectures and}} video shows about {{wildlife}} and guided {{tours of the}} park and animal orphanage. These tours are primarily, but not exclusively, to educate schools and local communities. There has been criticism about animals' housing, and they now have more spacious housing in a more natural environment. The Kenya Wildlife Service has created a Safari Walk that highlights the variety of plants and animals that are <b>in</b> <b>Kenya,</b> <b>and</b> how they affect Kenya's population.|$|E
5|$|In 1968 Franco-Caribbean writer Aimé Césaire {{published}} Une Tempête, {{a radical}} {{adaptation of the}} play based on its colonial and postcolonial interpretations, in which Caliban is a black rebel and Ariel is mixed-race. The figure of Caliban influenced numerous works of African literature in the 1970s, including pieces by Taban Lo Liyong in Uganda, Lemuel Johnson in Sierra Leone, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o <b>in</b> <b>Kenya,</b> <b>and</b> David Wallace of Zambia's Do You Love Me, Master?. A similar phenomenon occurred in late 20th-century Canada, where several writers produced works inspired by Miranda, including The Diviners by Margaret Laurence, Prospero's Daughter by Constance Beresford-Howe and The Measure of Miranda by Sarah Murphy. Other writers have feminised Ariel (as in Marina Warner's novel Indigo) or Caliban (as in Suniti Namjoshi's sequence of poems Snapshots of Caliban).|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Hill {{founded the}} Refugee Project, a {{non-profit}} outreach organization {{that sought to}} transform the attitudes and behavior of at-risk urban youth. Part of this was Camp Hill, which offered stays in the Catskill Mountains for such youngsters; another was production of an annual Halloween haunted house in East Orange. Hill also raised money for Haitian refugees, supported clean water well-building projects <b>in</b> <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> Uganda, and staged a rap concert in Harlem to promote voter registration. A 1997 benefit event for the Refugee Project introduced a Board of Trustees for the organization that included Sean Combs, Mariah Carey, Busta Rhymes, Spike Lee, and others as members.|$|E

5|$|In {{the area}} of Pendjari National Park, almost all West African males are maneless or have very weak manes. Maneless, male African lions have also been {{reported}} from Senegal, from Sudan (Dinder National Park), and from Tsavo East National Park <b>in</b> <b>Kenya,</b> <b>and</b> the original male white lion from Timbavati also was maneless. The testosterone hormone {{has been linked to}} mane growth; therefore, castrated lions often have minimal to no mane, as the removal of the gonads inhibits testosterone production. In addition, increased testosterone may be the cause of the maned lionesses of northern Botswana.|$|E
5|$|The British Empire {{had been}} in {{transition}} since the 1920s, and the pace accelerated {{in the wake of}} the Second World War. More and more member states demanded independence, and a series of crises erupted during the 1950s, including the 1952 Mau Mau Uprising <b>in</b> <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> the Suez Crisis of 1956. During the same period immigration into Britain from the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean was on the increase, causing some resentment among elements of the native population. At the time Kneale was working on his scripts black communities in Nottingham and London came under attack from mobs of white Britons; Kneale became keen to develop the serial as an allegory for the emerging racial tensions that culminated in the Notting Hill race riots of August and September 1958.|$|E
5|$|The Itcha Range is the {{smallest}} shield volcano in the Anahim Volcanic Belt in terms of area covered. Unlike the Rainbow and Ilgachuz ranges, the Itcha Range is composed of small coalescing volcanic units rather than a stratiform volcanic pile. It is, in many respects, similar to the small alkaline shields found <b>in</b> <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> Ethiopia along the East African Rift. About 60% of the shield is exposed while roughly 40% of it remains buried under glacial drift deposits. This suggests that the Itcha Range was glaciated repeatedly during the Pleistocene epoch. Glacial striae on polished surfaces {{of some of the}} oldest volcanic rocks {{in the eastern part of}} the shield and the local presence of drift deposits throughout the stratigraphy indicate that glaciation and volcanism were contemporaneous through much of the volcanic history of the Itcha Range.|$|E

5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is {{native to}} eastern and southern Africa. Its range includes Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland and Angola. It is no longer found in Malawi but has been successfully reintroduced into Namibia. Blue wildebeest are mainly found in short grass plains bordering bush-covered acacia savannas, thriving {{in areas that are}} neither too wet nor too dry. They can be found in habitats that vary from overgrazed areas with dense bush to open woodland floodplains. In East Africa, the blue wildebeest is the most abundant big game species, both in population and biomass. It is a notable feature of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, the Maasai Mara National Reserve <b>in</b> <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> the Liuwa Plain National Park in Zambia.|$|E
5|$|The {{subspecies}} P.b.borbonica is resident on Mauritius and Réunion, {{although there}} are local seasonal movements on these island, but the Madagascan subspecies is migratory. The Imerina Plateau is deserted from April to September, the martins moving to lower ground or to the African mainland. It is normally uncommon and local in coastal Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi and Pemba Island, and very rare <b>in</b> <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> mainland Tanzania, although large numbers sometimes winter in Mozambique or Malawi. It has also been recorded from Comoros and other Indian Ocean locations including at least four islands in the Seychelles. As of 2012, a total of eight birds had been sighted in the Seychelles, occurring in both the spring and autumn migration periods. Some of these records {{may be due to}} vagrant birds carried by cyclones. There are unsubstantiated claims of occurrences in the Transvaal.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{occur in}} sub-Saharan Africa. The Mascarene martin's {{breeding}} range {{is restricted to}} Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands. The nominate subspecies breeds on Mauritius and Réunion and P. b. madagascariensis occurs in Madagascar. It may also nest on Pemba {{where it has been}} seen in the breeding season. Breeding habitat can be anywhere with suitable sites for constructing a nest, such as ledges, buildings, tunnels, caves or amongst rocks. The martin is found {{on the east side of}} Réunion between , and on the south and west coasts of Mauritius. It also occurs on inland cliffs on Mauritius. P. b. borbonica is resident on Mauritius and Réunion, although there are local seasonal movements on these island, but the Madagascan subspecies is migratory, with the martins moving to lower ground or to the African mainland outside the breeding season. It is normally uncommon and local in coastal Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi and Pemba Island, and very rare <b>in</b> <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> mainland Tanzania, although large numbers sometimes winter in Mozambique or Malawi. It has also been recorded from Comoros and other Indian Ocean locations including at least four islands in the Seychelles. Some of these records may be due to vagrant birds carried by cyclones.
