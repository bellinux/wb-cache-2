2500|$|The {{results of}} Vlašić's final {{year as a}} junior showed further {{development}} as a high jumper. She set a new indoor best of 1.92m at the 2002 European Indoor Championships and was the favourite to win the 2002 World Juniors. She won the competition {{by a margin of}} nine centimetres, setting a new personal best of 1.96m and attempting the symbolic two metres height. She failed to pass the bar but remained pleased with her achievements: [...] "This was the first time <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> 2-metre mark. That would have been a bonus. Today what matters is the gold. I am very happy I retained my world junior title". At the final major event of the season, the European Championships, she could not repeat her previous form and finished in fifth place. Nevertheless, {{at the end of the}} year she was ranked in the top ten high jumpers in the world for the season.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> garden. No! {{the garden}} was (for some inscrutable reason) not big enough. I had still some hours to spare. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> hills next.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> board {{next to the}} opening. The end was {{somewhat}} rotted, and it came up with hardly an effort.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> rocks, and <b>I</b> {{think it}} cool That they laugh {{with such an}} excess of glee, As I heavily slip into every pool That skirts the cold cold Sea.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{dare say}} you're {{wondering}} why I don't put my arm round your waist,' the Duchess {{said after a}} pause: 'the reason is, that I'm doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> experiment?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You did!" [...] exclaimed Joe. Then he laughed. [...] "It {{was lucky}} for me. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> dodge you taught me, {{but in my}} eagerness I missed." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time I began to realise fully what I had done in coming to this place at such an hour. Some wild {{thoughts}} of a tardy retreat flashed into my mind, and <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> handle of the door by which we had entered. It turned, but the door remained closed. I stooped down and examined it. The result was as I had feared--a spring lock had fastened it. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> other door, by which my guide had issued. The result was the same. I was a prisoner.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's so lonesome--with papa and mamma gone. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to read, but I can't {{seem to get}} {{interested}} in any book. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> newspapers, but they do put such rubbish in them. You take up a paper and start to read something you thinks interesting, {{and it goes on}} and on and on about how somebody--well, Dr. Snodgrass, for instance--" ...|$|R
60|$|First {{in these}} fields <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> sylvan strains, Nor blush to sport on Windsor's blissful plains: Fair Thames, flow gently from thy sacred spring, While on thy banks Sicilian Muses sing; Let vernal airs through {{trembling}} osiers play, And Albion's cliffs resound the rural lay.|$|R
5000|$|She {{started running}} in 1987 {{at the age}} of 28 years. Previously, she had not done any sport. [...] "Since then <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> {{teaching}} of integral Yoga.

6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] he answered. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> wrong way." [...] "The {{right way}} might be found," [...] he added, [...] "by the right man, and woman." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> door softly, {{but it was}} locked. Then I knocked. There was no answer. Turning away, I {{entered the}} next stall and, {{mounting}} a step-ladder, looked over the partition.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> drawing-room. There was his {{handkerchief}} on the floor, {{to prove that}} he had drifted in. And there was the empty room {{to prove that he}} had drifted out again.|$|E
6000|$|Behold the groves that shine {{with silver}} frost, Their beauty wither'd, and their verdure lost.

60|$|About {{nine o'clock}} I {{went with the}} hot water to the Red Room. After {{knocking}} twice <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> door, and, finding it not locked, went in with the jug in my hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "And that," [...] he cried, [...] "is {{just what}} I'm {{going to give}} you. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> machine first just {{in order to test}} the thing in other ways {{afterwards}} and the machine, sir, is right." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{uppermost}} side, when I {{spread it}} out, presented to view innumerable folds and creases, and nothing more. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> undermost side, next--and instantly discovered the smear {{of the paint}} from the door of Rachel's boudoir! ...|$|E
6000|$|Henry led Agnes to {{the figure}} on the left, as they stood facing the empty fire-place. 'Shall <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> experiment,' he asked, 'or will you?' She {{abruptly}} drew her arm away from him, {{and turned back to}} the door. 'I can't even look at it,' she said. 'That merciless marble face frightens me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Why not?’ I continued. ‘The idea is good. I {{should be}} safe in there if I were the monster Williams himself. The great {{thing is to}} have me under lock and key. For it does lock; it is locked now,’ said <b>I,</b> <b>trying</b> <b>the</b> door. ‘A propos, what have you for a cargo? It must be precious.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|So I {{cleared the}} inn of wine, [...] And <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to climb <b>the</b> sign, [...] And <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to hail <b>the</b> constable as [...] "Marion." [...] But he said I couldn't speak, [...] And he bowled {{me to the}} Beak [...] Because I was a Happy Vegetarian.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> keyhole with my finger. The key {{was not in}} the lock. I knelt down, {{and looked}} through the keyhole. The next instant, I was up again on my feet, wild and giddy with horror.|$|E
60|$|From {{our point}} of view this was a frame of mind to be encouraged. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> {{experiment}} of modestly taking the blame on myself. I suggested that I might be (quite innocently) answerable for Romayne's disappointment.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} had {{something}} open when <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> experiment," [...] said the professor. [...] "But I became so interested that I forgot. If you hadn't come when you did, I don't know what would have happened." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The Harder <b>I</b> <b>Try</b> (<b>The</b> Bluer <b>I</b> Get)" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Frank F. Robinson and {{performed}} by The Free Movement. It reached #6 on the US adult contemporary chart, #49 on the US R&B chart, and #50 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1972. [...] The song was featured on their 1972 album, I've Found Someone of My Own.|$|R

6000|$|... 1243. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> same {{experiment}} having air {{only in the}} inductive apparatus. After {{a continued}} high charge for some time I could obtain a little effect of return action, but it was ultimately traced to the shell-lac of the stem.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> walls, and <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> floor, and <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> ceiling, {{but though}} I tapped and probed, they all {{appeared}} to be very thick and solid. The door was of iron, shutting with a spring lock, and provided with a small grating, through which a warder looked twice in every night. Within there were two beds, two stools, two washstands--nothing more. It was enough for my wants, for when had I had as much during those twelve years spent in camps? But how was I to get out? Night after night I thought of my five hundred hussars, and had dreadful nightmares, in which I fancied that the whole regiment needed shoeing, or that my horses were all bloated with green fodder, or that they were foundered from bogland, or that six squadrons were clubbed {{in the presence of}} the Emperor. Then I would awake in a cold sweat, and set to work picking and tapping at the walls once more; for I knew very well that there is no difficulty which cannot be overcome by a ready brain and a pair of cunning hands.|$|E
