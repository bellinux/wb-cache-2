40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the possibility of using}} emerging code query technologies in industry. For that purpose we evaluated three alternatives: Crocopat, Rscript, and SemmleCode. We made a comparison with respect to eight criteria focussing on language <b>features</b> <b>and</b> <b>tool</b> integration issues. Although the available solutions are promising we found that none of them fully satisfies our requirements. In particular, we found that the combination of good abstraction and extension facilities lacks in all languages, and that an API is missing from all tools. We recognize a need for a solution that offers the language abstraction facilities offered by Rscript and the extendability of SemmleCode combined with an API to achieve a smooth integration with existing technologies. We expect that meeting these challenges will expedite industrial adoption. 1...|$|R

This paper first characterizes software maintenance, and {{open source software}} (OSS) reuse which are particularly relevant in this context. The information needs of maintainers and reusers can be supported by reverse engineering tools at different information retrieval levels. The paper presents an automated license retrieval approach called ASLA. User needs, system architecture, <b>tool</b> <b>features,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tool</b> evaluation are presented. The implemented tool features support identifying source file dependencies and licenses in source files, and adding new license templates for identifying licenses. The tool is evaluated against another tool for license information extraction. ASLA requires the source code as available input but is otherwise not limited to OSS. It supports the same programming languages as GCC. License identification coverage is good <b>and</b> the <b>tool</b> is extendable. ...|$|R

50|$|Archaeologists Dennis Stanford and Bruce Bradley {{suggest that}} the Clovis point derived from the points of the Solutrean culture of {{southern}} France (19,000 BP) through the Cactus Hill points of Virginia (16,000 BP) to the Clovis point.
