He had {{a photograph of the}} card taken before the transaction with Mastro and claimed that the card in the photo looked significantly different from the photo of Gretzky's card. He sent the comparison of the two photos to both McNall and Sotheby's, but never received a response back. Some memorabilia collectors have dismissed Ray's claims, saying that the photo hardly proves any doctoring was ever done on the card.|$|E

Additional polar bear hunting was filmed in March 1933 off Cape Lisburne. The bowhead whale hunt was filmed from late April to July 1933 in two locations: Off Point Hope, Alaska, and off Cape Serdtse-Kamen on the Chukchi Peninsula. The whale hunting shoot took nearly three months because the whales kept fleeing every time they spotted boats. As depicted in the film, the Inupiat also hunted polar bears by roping and drowning them, but little of this footage made it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b>|$|E

25|$|Among the {{individuals}} in Japan after their 1945 surrender was Lieutenant Colonel Murray Sanders, who arrived in Yokohama via the American ship Sturgess in September 1945. Sanders was a highly regarded microbiologist {{and a member of}} America's military center for biological weapons. Sanders' duty was to investigate Japanese biological warfare activity. At the time of his arrival in Japan he had no knowledge of what Unit 731 was. Until Sanders finally threatened the Japanese with bringing communism <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> little information about biological warfare was being shared with the Americans. The Japanese wanted to avoid the Soviet legal system so the next morning after the threat Sanders received a manuscript describing Japan's involvement in biological warfare. Sanders took this information to General Douglas MacArthur, who was the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers responsible for rebuilding Japan during the Allied occupations. MacArthur struck a deal with Japanese informants—he secretly granted immunity to the physicians of Unit 731, including their leader, in exchange for providing America, but not the other wartime allies, with their research on biological warfare and data from human experimentation. American occupation authorities monitored the activities of former unit members, including reading and censoring their mail. The U.S. believed that the research data were valuable. The U.S. did not want other nations, particularly the Soviet Union, to acquire data on biological weapons.|$|E

Keltner, who described his own friendship with Harrison as [...] "like brothers", has similarly spoken of Los Angeles as an unsuitable environment for Harrison during this period, while commenting that Arias [...] "came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> at just the right time, a crazy, dark time".

500|$|According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, {{the song}} is {{influenced}} by the Sly and the Family Stone track [...] "Family Affair" [...] (1971). It starts as the sound of slap bass plays along with sequenced synth bass, as Madonna sings the opening lines, [...] "Keep, keep it together, keep people together forever and ever". As the first verse starts, a guitar comes into play with Madonna's voice being backed by percussion and banjo. After the second chorus comes near the end, Madonna utters the line [...] "Brothers and sisters, They hold the key, To your heart and your soul, Don't forget that your family is gold", the percussion sound is thinned out and a mixture of the sound from a live drummer and conga comes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> The song ends with the main groove sound gradually fading out.|$|E

[...] Hanneman said: [...] "We go through dry spells sometimes, but {{the good thing about}} having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell." [...] King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums.

500|$|... "Enter Sandman" [...] {{had what}} Hetfield {{described}} as a [...] "wall of guitars"— three rhythm guitar tracks of the same riff played by himself to create a [...] "wall of sound". According to engineer Randy Staub, close to 50 takes of the drums were recorded because Ulrich did not record the song in its entirety, but rather recorded each section of the song separately. Because {{it was difficult to}} get in one take the [...] "intensity" [...] that the band wanted, numerous takes were selected and edited together. Staub mentioned that the producing team spent much time in getting the best sound from each part of the room and used several combinations of 40 to 50 microphones in recording the drums and guitars to simulate the sound of a live concert. The bass guitar sound also gained importance with Rock; as Newsted states, Metallica's sound was previously [...] "very guitar-oriented" [...] and that [...] "when he [...] came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> bass frequencies also came into the picture." [...] As the first single, [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] was also the first song to be mixed, a task that took roughly ten days because the band and Bob Rock had to create the sound for the entire album while mixing the song.|$|E
500|$|Coulton Waugh {{attempted}} {{the first}} comprehensive history of American comics with The Comics (1947). [...] Will Eisner's Comics and Sequential Art (1985) and Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics (1993) were early attempts in English to formalize the study of comics. [...] David Carrier's The Aesthetics of Comics (2000) was the first full-length treatment of comics from a philosophical perspective. [...] Prominent American attempts at definitions of comics include Eisner's, McCloud's, and Harvey's. [...] Eisner described what he called [...] "sequential art" [...] as [...] "the arrangement of pictures or images and words to narrate a story or dramatize an idea"; [...] Scott McCloud defined comics as [...] "juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer", a strictly formal definition which detached comics from its historical and cultural trappings. [...] R.C. Harvey defined comics as [...] "pictorial narratives or expositions in which words (often lettered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> area within speech balloons) usually contribute {{to the meaning of}} the pictures and vice versa". [...] Each definition has had its detractors. [...] Harvey saw McCloud's definition as excluding single-panel cartoons, [...] and objected to McCloud's de-emphasizing verbal elements, insisting [...] "the essential characteristic of comics is the incorporation of verbal content". [...] Aaron Meskin saw McCloud's theories as an artificial attempt to legitimize the place of comics in art history.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Steiger {{portrayed the}} comic actor W. C. Fields in an Arthur Hiller biopic, W. C. Fields and Me, for Universal Pictures. The screenplay, {{which was based}} on a memoir by Carlotta Monti, who was Fields' mistress for the last 14 years of his life, was penned by Bob Merrill. Steiger read extensively about Fields in preparation for the role, and developed an encyclopaedic knowledge of his career and personal life. He concluded that he would base his characterization around his performance in The Bank Dick (1940) [...] One day, Fields' mistress Monti turned up on set, and watched the scene where he briefly thanks everybody. Nervous that she might not approve, he broke down in tears after Monti met him after the scene and fondly said [...] "Woody, Woody, Woody, My Woody", a nickname used only by those very close to Fields. Despite the energy Steiger put <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> like the actor's previous recent films, it was poorly received by critics.
