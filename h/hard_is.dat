500|$|Considered by {{many critics}} {{as one of}} Dylan's masterpieces, [...] "Visions of Johanna" [...] proved {{difficult}} to capture on tape. Heylin places the writing {{in the fall of}} 1965, when Dylan was living in the Chelsea Hotel with his wife Sara. In the New York recording studio, on November 30, Dylan announced his epic composition: [...] "This is called 'Freeze Out'." [...] Gill notes that this working title captures the [...] "air of nocturnal suspension in which the verse tableaux are sketched... full of whispering and muttering." [...] Wilentz relates how Dylan guided his backing musicians through fourteen takes, trying to sketch out how he wanted it played, saying at one point, [...] "it's not hard rock, The only thing in it that's <b>hard</b> <b>is</b> Robbie." [...] Wilentz notes that, as Dylan quiets things down, he inches closer to what will appear on the album.|$|E
500|$|Some of the New York {{recordings}} were uptempo {{and contain}} {{in the fifth}} verse the additional line [...] "He examines the nightingale's code". Historian Sean Wilentz, for his book Dylan In America, listened closely to full studio tapes of the Blonde on Blonde sessions, and describes how Dylan guided the New York backing musicians through fourteen takes, trying to explain how he wanted [...] "Visions of Johanna" [...] played. At one point, Dylan says: [...] "It's not hard rock, The only thing in it that's <b>hard</b> <b>is</b> Robbie." [...] Analyzing {{the evolution of the}} song in the New York recording session, Wilentz writes that Dylan [...] "quiets things down, inching closer to what will eventually appear on Blonde on Blonde—and it is still not right." [...] Several complete takes of the song were recorded on November 30, including one with an uptempo rock beat, containing harpsichord accompaniment, and another with a march-like tempo, which was released on [...] in 2005.|$|E

In discussing his failed attempts to control his own addictive behavior in the past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that [...] "when someone says, 'I really wonder if maybe I should go to rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot." [...] He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, [...] "I said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I reached out for help, and I ran with it. You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it.

500|$|In Kids Can Say No!, Australian celebrity Rolf Harris appears {{with four}} {{children}} between the ages of seven and eight and warns them about paedophiles. The film begins with its theme song, [...] "My Body", which has the chorus [...] "My body's nobody's body but mine. You run your own body. Let me run mine." [...] During the song, children ride a seesaw, skip rope and cycle. Harris sits under a tree in a park with the children—two girls and two boys—and tells them about proper and improper physical intimacy, which he calls [...] "yes" [...] and [...] "no" [...] feelings; a parent's hug is given as an example of a [...] "yes" [...] feeling. In vox populi segments, children give other examples of [...] "yes" [...] and [...] "no" [...] feelings; one child says that being tickled by his father is a [...] "yes" [...] feeling, and another says that being squeezed <b>hard</b> <b>is</b> a [...] "no" [...] feeling. Harris leads the children in a chant of [...] "Go away!" [...] as an exercise in how to respond to [...] "no" [...] feelings. He teaches the children about stranger danger, and that adults they know can also be a threat.|$|E

[...] This increase in work hours {{over the past two}} decades means that less time will be spent with family, friends, and community as well as pursuing activities that one enjoys and taking the time to grow personally and spiritually.|$|E

2500|$|Before Smale proved this theorem, mathematicians became stuck {{while trying}} to {{understand}} manifolds of dimension 3 or 4, and assumed that the higher-dimensional cases were even harder. The h-cobordism theorem showed that (simply connected) manifolds of dimension at least 5 are much easier than those of dimension 3 or 4. The proof of the theorem depends on the [...] "Whitney trick" [...] of Hassler Whitney, which geometrically untangles homologically-tangled spheres of complementary dimension in a manifold of dimension >4. An informal reason why manifolds of dimension 3 or 4 are unusually <b>hard</b> <b>is</b> that the trick fails to work in lower dimensions, which have no room for untanglement.|$|E
