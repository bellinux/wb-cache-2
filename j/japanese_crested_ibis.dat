40|$|The major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) is a highly polymorphic genomic region that plays {{a central role in}} the immune system. Despite its functional consistency, the genomic structure of the MHC differs substantially among organisms. In birds, the MHC-B structures of Galliformes, including chickens, have been well characterized, but information about other avian MHCs remains sparse. The <b>Japanese</b> <b>Crested</b> <b>Ibis</b> (Nipponia nippon, Pelecaniformes) is an internationally conserved, critically threatened species. The current Japanese population of N. nippon originates from only five founders; thus, understanding the genetic diversity among these founders is critical for effective population management. Because of its high polymorphism and importance for disease resistance and other functions, the MHC has been an important focus in the conservation of endangered species. Here, we report the structure and polymorphism of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>Crested</b> <b>Ibis</b> MHC class II region. Screening of genomic libraries allowed the construction of three contigs representing different haplotypes of MHC class II regions. Characterization of genomic clones revealed that the MHC class II genomic structure of N. nippon was largely different from that of chicken. A pair of MHC-IIA and -IIB genes was arranged head-to-head between the COL 11 A 2 and BRD 2 genes. Gene order in N. nippon was more similar to that in humans than to that in chicken. The three haplotypes contained one to three copies of MHC-IIA/IIB gene pairs. Genotyping of the MHC class II region detected only three haplotypes among the five founders, suggesting that the genetic diversity of the current <b>Japanese</b> <b>Crested</b> <b>Ibis</b> population is extremely low. The structure of the MHC class II region presented here provides valuable insight for future studies on the evolution of the avian MHC and for conservation of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>Crested</b> <b>Ibis...</b>|$|E

40|$|The <b>Crested</b> <b>Ibis</b> Nipponia nippon {{was once}} thought to be extinct in the wild until seven birds were {{discovered}} in a remote mountain village in China in 1981. Studies suggested that winter-flooded rice fields play an essential role in nest site selection by the <b>Crested</b> <b>Ibis</b> and hence in their survival. Considerable efforts were therefore made to conserve the winter-flooded rice fields, but these have caused conflicts between the agricultural and conservation communities. The population and geographical range of the wild <b>Crested</b> <b>Ibis</b> has expanded greatly since 1981, but there is no spatial information on the winter-flooded rice fields, nor on the current association of nest sites and winter-flooded rice fields. We mapped winter-flooded rice fields across the entire current range of <b>Crested</b> <b>Ibis</b> using innovative remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) techniques. The spatial relationships between the nest site clusters and winter-flooded rice fields were quantified using Ward’s hierarchical clustering method and Ripley’s K-function. We show that both have significantly clumped distribution patterns and that they are positively associated. However, the dependence of <b>Crested</b> <b>Ibis</b> on the winter-flooded rice fields varied significantly among the nest site clusters and has decreased over the years, indicating the absence of winter-flooded rice fields is not constraining their recovery and population expansion. We therefore recommend that efforts should be made to protect the existing winter-flooded rice fields and to restore the functionality of natural and semi-natural wetlands, to encourage both in-situ conservation and the re-introduction of the <b>Crested</b> <b>Ibis.</b> In addition, w...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>crested</b> <b>ibis</b> Nipponia nippon is a {{critically}} threatened bird. We assessed genetic diversity and {{structure in the}} Sado captive population of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>crested</b> <b>ibis</b> based on 24 and 50 microsatellite markers developed respectively for the same and related species. Of a total of 74 loci, 19 showed polymorphisms in the five founder birds of the population, and therefore were useful {{for the analysis of}} genetic diversity and structure. Genetic diversity measures, A, ne, He, Hoand PIC, obtained by genotyping of the 138 descendants were similar to those of other species with population bottlenecks, and thus considerably low. The low level of genetic diversity resulting from such bottlenecks was consistent with the results of lower genetic diversity measures for the Sado captive relative to the Chinese population that is the source population for the Sado group as determined using previously reported data and heterozygosity excess by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium tests. Further, individual clustering based on the allele-sharing distance and Bayesian model-based clustering revealed that the founder genomes were equally at population in total, and with various admixture patterns at individual levels inherited by the descendants. The clustering results, together with the result of inheritance of all alleles of the microsatellites from the founders to descendants, suggest that planned mating in captive-breeding programs for the population has succeeded in maintaining genetic diversity and minimizing kinship. In addition, the Bayesian model-based clustering assumed two different components of genomes in the Sado captive <b>Japanese</b> <b>crested</b> <b>ibis,</b> supporting a considerably low level of genetic diversity...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>crested</b> <b>ibis</b> is {{an internationally}} conserved, {{critically}} threatened bird. Captive-breeding {{programs have been}} established to conserve this species in Japan. Since the current Japanese population of crested ibis originates only from 5 founders donated by the Chinese government, understanding the genetic diversity between them is critical for an effective population management. To discover genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and short tandem repeats (STRs) while obtaining genotype data of these polymorphic markers in each founder, reduced representation libraries were independently prepared {{from each of the}} founder genomes and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. This yielded 316 million 101 -bp reads. Consensus sequences were created by clustering sequence reads, and then sequence reads from each founder were mapped to the consensus sequences, resulting in the detection of 52, 512 putative SNPs and 162 putative STRs. The numbers of haplotypes and STR alleles and the investigation of genetic similarities suggested that the total genetic diversity between the founders was lower, although we could not identify a pair with closely related genome sequences. This study provided important insight into protocols for genetic management of the captive breeding population of <b>Japanese</b> <b>crested</b> <b>ibis</b> in Japan and towards the national project for reintroduction of captive-bred individuals into the wild.

40|$|Japanese {{population}} of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>crested</b> <b>ibis</b> Nipponia nippon was founded by five individuals gifted from the People's Republic of China. In order to exactly evaluate genetic structure, we first performed development of novel genetic makers using 89 microsatellite primer pairs of related species for cross-amplification. Of these, only three primer pairs were useful for the genetic markers. Additionally, we sequenced allelic PCR products of these three markers together with 10 markers previously identified. Most markers showed typical microsatellite repeat units, but two markers were not simple microsatellites. Moreover, {{over half of the}} markers did not have the same repeat units as those of the original species. These results suggested that development of novel genetic markers in this population by cross-amplification is not efficient, partly because of low genetic diversity. Furthermore, the cluster analysis by STRUCTURE program using 17 markers showed that the five founders were divided into two clusters. However, the genetic relationships among the founders indicated by the clustering seemed to be questionable, because the analysis relied largely on a small number of triallelic markers, in spite of the addition of the three useful markers. Therefore, more efficient methods for identifying large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms are desirable...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Once the Japanese ibis, or the <b>Japanese</b> <b>crested</b> <b>ibis,</b> {{was widely}} {{distributed}} in Asia including Japan, Korea, China and Siberia, {{and was not}} a rare species. However, this species started to disappear over its entire range {{beginning in the late}} 19 th or early 20 th century. Currently, only a single population of 15 - 20 individuals survives in wild in Yang Xian, Shaanxi, China. Several individuals, mostly immature birds, are kept in captivity in Beijing zoo. One of them is an adult male captured in 1981 in Japan and sent to Beijing zoo for breeding two years ago. In Japan, only, a single old female survives in captivity. Scientists of the Japanese Ibis Preservation Center in Sado Island and Ueno zoo, Tokyo, had attempted several times to breed Japanese ibises in captivity, but they have failed in all of their attempts. In Beijing zoo, a similar attempt is now being carried out. As the basis of an artificial breeding programme of this and other species of birds, the authors have attempted to establish a noninvasive method for estimation of gonadal activities of birds and also a method to induce a complete series of the ovarian activity, i. e., ovarian growth, ovulation and oviposition, by means of hormone administration to some species of birds. In this communication, the author briefly reports recent results of these attempts in addition to results of measurements of gonadotropin levels in plasma of captive Japanese ibises and white ibises, a closely related species, Threskiornis aethiopicus...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS. The avian {{epidermis}} {{is composed}} of unique sebokeratinocytes that elaborate and secrete sebum-like lipids as they cornify. In addition to the lipid droplets, the avian epidermis elaborates, but rarely secretes, lipid—enriched or-ganelles, the multigranular bodies. The multigranular bodies are analogous to the lamellar bodies of mammals (Menon et al., 1991), the secretion of which results in formation of occlusive lipid bilayers characteristic of mammalian stratum corneum and providing the permeability barrier. However, in contrast to mammals, the avian multigranular bodies form the reserve barrier mechanism. In the basal state, when multigranular bodies are not secreted, the avian cutaneous barrier is defi-cient, but allows evaporative cooling for thermoregulation. However, under con-ditions of water deficit, multigranular body secretion allows for rapid facultative waterproofing, as shown in zebra finches (Taenyopygia guttata). In certain glabrous regions of the skin, such as the maxillary rictus, interdigital web, and combs and wattles in the domestic fowl, {{there is a high}} degree of epidermal lipid secretion. Also specialized feathers such as powder downs elaborate lipid rich material, which can be classified as secretion. Additionally, an inverse relation between epidermal lipogenesis and the degree of feathering has been demonstrated, as in temporarily bare areas (e. g., brood patches) and following permanent feather loss from the head accompanying attainment of maturity in certain ibises and storks. In the latter, the neo-apteria often hold large reserves of carotenoids dissolved in the lipid droplets, possibly related to an altered gradient of retinoids influencing feather morphogenesis. Unusual secondary functions of epidermal lipids include cosmetic coloration (e. g., in the <b>Japanese</b> <b>Crested</b> <b>Ibis)</b> and chemical defense (e. g., in the Pitohui) ...|$|E
50|$|At one time, the <b>crested</b> <b>ibis</b> was {{widespread}} in Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan, and Russia. It has now disappeared {{from most of}} its former range. The last wild <b>crested</b> <b>ibis</b> in Japan died in October 2003, with the remaining wild population found only in Shaanxi province of China until reintroduction of captive bred birds back into Japan in 2008. They were previously thought to be extinct in China too, until 1981 when only seven ibises were seen in Shaanxi, China.|$|R
50|$|Extensive captive {{breeding}} {{programs have}} been developed by Japan and China to conserve the species. They were put on the State Protection List in China. Also, for the past 23 years, China has bred and protected the species. In 2002, there were a total of 130 colonies in China.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nearly {{one-quarter of}} all avian species is either {{threatened}} or nearly threatened. Of these, 73 species {{are currently being}} rescued from going extinct in wildlife sanctuaries. One of the previously most critically-endangered is the <b>crested</b> <b>ibis,</b> Nipponia nippon. Once widespread across North-East Asia, by 1981 only seven individuals from two breeding pairs remained in the wild. The recovering <b>crested</b> <b>ibis</b> populations thus provide an excellent example for conservation genomics since every individual bird has been recruited for genomic and demographic studies. RESULTS: Using high-quality genome sequences of multiple <b>crested</b> <b>ibis</b> individuals, its thriving co-habitant, the little egret, Egretta garzetta, and the recently sequenced genomes of 41 other avian species that are under various degrees of survival threats, including the bald eagle, we carry out comparative analyses for genomic signatures of near extinction events in association with environmental and behavioral attributes of species. We confirm that both loss of genetic diversity and enrichment of deleterious mutations of protein-coding genes contribute to the major genetic defects of the endangered species. We further identify that genetic inbreeding and loss-of-function genes in the <b>crested</b> <b>ibis</b> may all constitute genetic susceptibility to other factors including long-term climate change, over-hunting, and agrochemical overuse. We also establish a genome-wide DNA identification platform for molecular breeding and conservation practices, to facilitate sustainable recovery of endangered species. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate common genomic signatures of population decline across avian species and pave a way for further effort in saving endangered species and enhancing conservation genomic efforts...|$|R

40|$|Whole-genome shotgun (WGS) {{sequencing}} {{has become}} a routine method in genome research over the past decade. However, the assembly of highly polymorphic regions in WGS projects remains a challenge, especially for large genomes. Employing BAC library constructing, PCR screening and Sanger sequencing, traditional strategy is laborious and expensive, which hampers research on polymorphic genomic regions. As {{one of the most}} highly polymorphic regions, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) plays {{a central role in the}} adaptive immunity of all jawed vertebrates. In this study, we introduced an efficient procedure based on recombination screening and short-reads assembly. With this procedure, we constructed a high quality 488 -kb region of <b>crested</b> <b>ibis</b> MHC that consists of 3 superscaffolds and contains 50 genes. Our sequence showed comparable quality (97. 29 % identity) to traditional Sanger assembly, while the workload was reduced almost 7 times. Comparative study revealed distinctive features of <b>crested</b> <b>ibis</b> by exhibiting the COL 11 A 2 -BLA-BLB-BRD 2 cluster and presenting both ADPRH and odorant receptor (OR) gene in the MHC region. Furthermore, the conservation of the BF-TAP 1 -TAP 2 structure in <b>crested</b> <b>ibis</b> and other vertebrate lineages is interesting in light of the hypothesis that coevolution of functionally related genes in the primordial MHC is responsible for the appearance of the antigen presentation pathways at the birth of the adaptive immune system...|$|R

40|$|The animal {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) length polymorphism and heteroplasmy {{are accepted}} to be universal. Here we report {{the lack of}} structural variation but the presence of length polymorphism as well as heteroplasmy in mtDNA control region of an endangered avian species – the <b>Crested</b> <b>Ibis</b> (Nipponia nippon). The complete control region was directly sequenced while the distribution pattern and inheritance of the length variations were examined using both direct sequencing and genotyping of the PCR fragments from captive birds with pedigrees, wild birds and a historical specimen. Our results demonstrated {{that there was no}} structural variation in the control region, however, different numbers of short tandem repeats with an identical motif of CA 3 CA 2 CA 3 at the 3 ′-end of the control region determined the length polymorphisms among and heteroplasmy within individual birds. There were one to three predominant fragments in every bird; nevertheless multiple minor fragments coexist in all birds. These extremely high polymorphisms were suggested to have derived from the ‘replication slippage’ of a perfect microsatellite evolution following the step-wise mutational model. The patterns of heteroplasmy were found to be shifted between generations and among siblings but rather stable between blood and feather samples. This study provides the first evidence of a very extensive mtDNA length polymorphism and heteroplasmy in the highly inbred <b>Crested</b> <b>Ibis</b> which carries an mtDNA genome lack of structural genetic diversity. The analysis of pedigreed samples also sheds light on the transmission of mtDNA length heteroplasmy in birds following the genetic bottleneck theory. Further research focusing on the generation and transmission of particular mtDNA heteroplasmy patterns in single germ line of <b>Crested</b> <b>Ibis</b> is encouraged by this study...|$|R
