He began seeing more and more scripts, writing scripts and developed the urge to direct. Hill:Seeing so many of the European films, Japanese films, I was part of this isolated community in east Hollywood. I remembered thinking just a little further west they are making the films I want to see. I'm going to do this. Sink or swim... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> writer on my way to being a director. Directors were already my heroes. Kurosawa, number of Italian directors... Movies from England, France, Sweden, Italy. Poland... One wanted a chance to tell stories in an open, loose, not constricted Hollywood kind of way. At the same time you wanted to work in Hollywood... I was tremendously interested in genre films. Wanted to work within genre films.|$|E

[...] Renoir had initially wanted to screen the film at the 1939 World's Fair in New York City, but this idea was abandoned after the disastrous release in France.|$|E

You get to hear the real story of the songs, which is important to me". The audience for the program was selected on a contest where fans over the age of 18 could send photos and explain why they were fans of Perry. The episode featuring Perry was recorded on July 22, 2009. For the recording, Perry was dressed in a pale pink chiffon evening gown, with flowers in her hair. She further said: [...] "Some people have an idea who I am, a little piece of the cake, but I get to show off really more. I have a larger-than-life personality and my clothes reflect that. For MTV Unplugged, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> mixture of Stevie Nicks and a fairy!".|$|E

At age 15, he snorkeled for the first time; Hillenburg {{took part in a}} [...] "dive program" [...] at Woods Coves in Laguna Beach, California, as part of the Regional Occupational Program at Savanna. This experience, as well as subsequent dives, reinforced his interest in, and led to his decision to study, marine biology in college: [...] "The switch clicked and I decided <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> marine biologist, but I also liked being an artist." [...] Some of his high-school teachers, who knew of his interest in art and fascination with the ocean, advised him otherwise, saying: [...] "You should just draw fish." [...] However, the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him and he was more riveted by [...] "making weird, little paintings". During a few summers after finishing high school, he worked as a fry cook and lobster boiler at a fast-food seafood restaurant in Maine. (This later inspired SpongeBob SquarePants' occupation in the television series, which he would begin developing in 1994.) ...|$|E

500|$|As a child, Diamandis took {{inspiration}} from the differing musical tastes of her parents – Dolly Parton, Enya and George Michael from her mother, and Haris Alexiou from her father – while also admiring pop acts of the era including the Spice Girls, Britney Spears and S Club 7. Diamandis has revealed that [...] "Madonna was the reason <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> pop star {{from the age of}} 15," [...] however she also stated that she did not listen to music [...] "properly" [...] until the age of 19, when she took influence from acts including PJ Harvey, Fiona Apple and The Distillers. She began smoking two years later in an attempt to sound like The Distillers' frontwoman Brody Dalle, [...] "but it never worked, and now I'm just stuck with a bad habit." [...] She has cited Dalle and Spears as her musical influences, and has expressed a particular interest in Daniel Johnston and the lo-fi production he uses. She has jokingly stated that [...] "I probably have a bit of a different sound because I don't really know what I'm doing!," [...] referencing her lack of formal musical training. Diamandis has synesthesia, and as a result associates particular colours with musical notes and days of the week.|$|E
500|$|Protesters in Boston, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Toronto, Edinburgh, London, {{and other}} cities worldwide, wore Guy Fawkes masks modeled after the 2005 film V for Vendetta. (Guy Fawkes was an English Catholic {{executed}} for a 1605 attempt to destroy the House of Lords. In V for Vendetta, a rebel against a near-future fascist regime uses the mask in his public appearances and distributes many of its copies to the population to enable mass protests. The Boston Globe characterized usage of the Guy Fawkes masks as [...] "an allusion to the British insurgent and a film depicting an antigovernment movement". Aaron Tavena of College Times wrote that the Guy Fawkes masks provided a [...] "dramatic effect" [...] to the protests, and Nick Jamison of The Retriever Weekly wrote: [...] "During the February 10 protests, Anonymous was informative, Anonymous was peaceful, and Anonymous was effective. After seeing all of the pictures from the 10th with everyone in disguise, many sporting Guy Fawkes masks, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> part of that."

Upon being cast as Kristensen, Bana researched the fallen serviceman and his family. On joining the production of Lone Survivor, Bana stated, [...] "There are two factors that make this story special, and they are the reasons why I jumped on board. One is the story itself, and two is who chooses to direct a project like this. I knew how involved [...] would be and that he would know how to portray SEAL teammates. That was what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> part of. The greatest way to honor these guys is to make a great film and have it stand the test of time."

[...] "It was far more important to be the person that was responsible for that part of the story and understand that completely.

500|$|Unlike the band's three {{previous}} albums, {{most of the}} songs on Spiritual Machines were written solely by Maida. “I think that because this record happened quickly, we just ended up using {{a lot more of}} my songs this time,” stated Maida. “Whatever happens, happens, and if there are good ideas lying around, we use them.” Also unlike on their previous albums, this one was recorded sporadically piece by piece with songs being added as others were discarded. Raine had made several vocal demos at his new home recording studio before the Spiritual Machines idea had come into play. Many of these demos were used for the final recordings and Raine was given production credits. “It was more a means to an end." [...] he explained, [...] "I would start off with a 4-track, then move to an 8-track, then go to digital. I have a ProTools system set up in my basement, so I just try to finish songs and {{get them out of the}} way so I don’t build up this backlog of ideas.
