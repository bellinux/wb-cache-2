5|$|Barnes was first-choice as an opener with Arthur Morris {{throughout}} the Test series, {{although it was}} not until the Third Test that they had a first-wicket partnership of any substance.

5|$|Bégin {{was signed}} to a one-year, AHL {{contract}} with the Abbotsford Heat for the 2013–14 season. He was unable to play due to another injury and, after doctors informed {{him that he would}} miss the <b>entire</b> <b>season,</b> Bégin announced his retirement on January 16, 2014.|$|E

40|$|The male: female (sex) {{ratio is}} of {{considerable}} importance in understanding population dynamics of species. A null hypothesis was tested that the male:female (sex) ratio of Carabus species does not differ measurably when <b>entire</b> <b>seasons</b> are considered, but may differ considerably over shorter periods, indicating differences in annual rhythms between the sexes. The sex ratios in nine Carabus species (C. arvensis, C. cancellatus, C. coriaceus, C. glabratus, C. granulatus, C. hortensis, C. nemoralis, C. nitens, and C. violaceus) were studied using pitfall traps in forests and open land, totally 20 sites, during the <b>entire</b> <b>seasons</b> of 2007, 2009, and/or 2011. The ratio varied considerably and mostly consistently among species. The ratios were < 1 (usually ca 0. 6), calculated over <b>entire</b> <b>seasons</b> in C. arvensis, C. glabratus and C. granulatus. On the contrary, males dominated {{in the other}} six species, and were particularly over-represented in C. cancellatus, C. nemoralis, and C. nitens with ratios of 2. 2 - 2. 7. Differences in the male:female ratio between different parts of seasons were demonstrated in three species. Calculated over <b>entire</b> <b>seasons,</b> there was some dominance of males in C. coriaceus and C. hortensis. Females dominated over males in July, males dominated in September. The pattern for C. violaceus was less consistent. The possible influence on the sex ratios of capturing method, habitat properties, nutritional status, season, differing life span and annual or diurnal rhythm of activity {{of males and females}} is considered and discussed...|$|R

5|$|In 1999, Affeldt {{spent the}} <b>entire</b> <b>season</b> with the Royals' single-A affiliate, which had changed to the Charleston Alley Cats during the offseason. Although he only went 77, {{he had a}} 3.83 ERA in twentyseven games (twentyfour starts).|$|E
5|$|Ottawa {{was locked}} in a {{contract}} dispute with then-captain Alexei Yashin during the 1999–2000 season. Yashin held out for the <b>entire</b> <b>season,</b> hoping either to play elsewhere or claim his contract was for 1999–2000, not a year of service. The team responded by suspending him for the <b>entire</b> <b>season</b> and granting the captaincy to Daniel Alfredsson. Yashin tried to sign on with a team in Switzerland, but the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) banned him from playing internationally until the dispute with the Senators was resolved. An NHL arbitrator rejected Yashin's request {{to make him a}} free agent, instead ruling that he owed the Senators one more season if he ever returned to the NHL. The Senators even took legal action to recover damages suffered {{as a result of the}} dispute.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, Reynolds won 16 games, {{even though}} he pitched with bone chips in his elbow for the <b>entire</b> <b>season.</b> His {{remarkable}} 1951 season began under very difficult conditions. Floating chips in his elbow prevented him from throwing a single pitch in spring training. He was resigned to having surgery which would have cost him {{at least half of}} the season. Dr. George Bennett of Johns Hopkins University recommended against surgery. Reynolds appeared in his first game one week after the season started.|$|E
5|$|In the 1961–62 season, Robertson {{became the}} first player in NBA history to average a triple-double for an <b>entire</b> <b>season,</b> with 30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds and 11.4 assists. Robertson also set a then-NBA record for the most triple-doubles {{during the regular season}} with 41 triple-doubles; the record would stand for over half a century when, in 2016–17, Russell Westbrook {{recorded}} 42 and joined Robertson as the only other player to average a triple-double for an <b>entire</b> <b>season.</b> He broke the assists record by Bob Cousy, who had recorded 715 assists two seasons earlier, by logging 899. The Royals earned a playoff berth; however, they were eliminated in the first round by the Detroit Pistons. In the next season, Robertson further established himself {{as one of the greatest}} players of his generation, averaging 28.3 points, 10.4 rebounds and 9.5 assists, narrowly missing out on another triple-double season. The Royals advanced to the Eastern Division Finals, but succumbed in a seven-game series against a Boston Celtics team led by Bill Russell.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee {{defeated}} Connecticut {{again in}} the 1997–98 regular season. A mini controversy erupted {{in the days after}} the game when Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw was quoted in the papers as saying UConn looked scared during the game; Auriemma denounced that quote. With Shea Ralph and senior Nykesha Sales out for the <b>entire</b> <b>season,</b> freshman Svetlana Abrosimova led a young UConn team to the NCAA Tournament Regional Final where they eventually lost to North Carolina State 60–52.|$|E

5|$|The 1957–58 {{season was}} an unusual one for Manchester City, which became the first and thus far only English team both to score and to concede 100 goals in a season. Trautmann played in 34 matches, and {{though he did not}} play in the 9–2 defeat to West Bromwich Albion, an 8–4 defeat to Leicester City was a record for the most goals conceded by Trautmann in a match in his career, and in the <b>entire</b> <b>season</b> he kept only two clean sheets.|$|E

5|$|Against Georgia, most critics thought Maryland faced {{its first}} true test. In the first quarter, the Terrapins {{took a quick}} 14–0 lead and held the Bulldogs to six {{offensive}} plays, two of which were punts. In the second quarter, Georgia quarterback Zeke Bratkowski led his team to two consecutive touchdown drives, and the score was 21–13 in favor of Maryland at halftime. Two minutes into the third quarter, Faloney intercepted a Bratkowski pass and returned it for a touchdown. Bratkowski {{was taken out of}} the game after numerous sacks by Stan Jones and Bob Morgan. The 40–13 final result would be the most points the Terrapins allowed during the <b>entire</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
