40|$|Approximately 400 {{million people}} {{worldwide}} {{are infected with}} chronic hepatitis B (CHB), with approximately 1 million deaths annually from hepatitis B virus (HBV) -related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 1. The majority of Asian patients acquires HBV either at birth, or within {{the first few years}} after birth, and is characterised by a prolonged immunotolerant phase followed by a prolonged phase of <b>immunoclearance.</b> Patients will undergo hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion with development of antibodies to HBeAg (anti-HBe) during the natural evolution of the disease, median age of HBeAg seroconversion being around 35 years. However there may be ongoing disease progression to cirrhosis and HCC after HBeAg seroconversion in a proportion o...|$|E
40|$|Tumor cells escape {{clearance}} by complement by abundantly expressing CD 59 {{and other}} membrane complement regulators. Existing strategies for blocking/knocking down these regulators {{can contribute to}} tumor <b>immunoclearance</b> in vitro; however, there are numerous difficulties restricting their use in vivo. Here, we report a new strategy for suppression of CD 59 expression in neuroblastoma using peptides that target regulators of CD 59 expression. We identified the neural-restrictive silencer factor (REST) as a target for modulation of CD 59 expression in neuroblastoma. We next designed plasmids that encoded peptides comprising different DNA-binding domains of REST and transfected them into neuroblastoma cell lines. These peptides suppressed CD 59 expression, sensitizing neuroblastoma to complement-mediated killing triggered by anti-GD 2 therapeutic monoclonal antibody. These CD 59 -modulating peptides might be effective therapeutic adjuvants to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies used for treatment of neuroblastoma and other cancer types sharing the same mechanism for regulation of CD 59 expression...|$|E
40|$|The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology {{seeks to}} address growing {{concerns}} about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of 50 {{papers in the}} field of cancer biology published between 2010 and 2012. This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from ‘Senescence surveillance of pre-malignant hepatocytes limits liver cancer development’ by Kang et al. (2011), published in Nature in 2011. The experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 3 B, 3 C, 3 E, and 4 A. In these experiments, Kang et al. (2011) demonstrate the phenomenon of oncogene-induced cellular senescence and immune-mediated clearance of senescent cells after intrahepatic injection of NRAS (Figures 2 I, 3 B, 3 C, and 3 E). Additionally, Kang et al. (2011) show the specific necessity of CD 4 + T cells for <b>immunoclearance</b> of senescent cells (Figure 4 A). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange, and the results of the replications will be published by eLife...|$|E
40|$|The {{anti-human}} {{immunodeficiency virus}} type I (anti-HIV- 1) effects of γ-glutamylcysteine ethyl ester (γ-GCE; TEI- 2306) {{were examined in}} vitro. In initial studies using a vigorously HIV- 1 -producing human T-lymphocytic cell line, γ-GCE displayed a novel biphasic repressive effect on chronic HIV- 1 infection that was unlike that of other glutathione prodrugs or other reported antioxidants. In high doses, up to a concentration of 2. 5 mM, at which neither glutathione (GSH) nor another GSH precursor has shown inhibitory effects, γ-GCE potently inhibited the production of HIV- 1 by a selective cytopathic effect against infected cells, while the viability and growth of uninfected cells were unaffected at the same γ-GCE concentrations. At lower concentrations (200 to 400 μM), γ-GCE significantly repressed the virus production from chronically HIV- 1 -expressing cells without affecting their viability. The discrepancy of the thresholds of the toxic doses between infected and uninfected cells {{was found to be}} more than 10 -fold. Relatively high doses of γ-GCE, utilized in acute HIV- 1 infection of T-lymphocytic cells, entirely blocked the propagation of HIV- 1 and rescued the cells from HIV- 1 -induced cell death. Furthermore, γ-GCE at such concentrations was found to directly inhibit the infectivity of HIV- 1 within 4 h. Repressive effects of γ-GCE on acute HIV- 1 infection in human primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were also demonstrated. Here, the anti-HIV- 1 strategy utilizing γ-GCE is removal of both HIV- 1 -producing cells and free infectious HIV- 1 in vitro, in place of specific <b>immunoclearance</b> in vivo, which might lead to an arrest or slowing of viral propagation in HIV- 1 -infected individuals...|$|E
40|$|Background: Chronic {{hepatitis}} B {{patients with}} genotype B achieve HBeAg seroconversion {{at an earlier}} age compared with those with genotype C (Yuen et al., Hepatology 2003). Whether this is due to differences in tile immune response to file hepatitis B virus during the imrnunoclearance phase between patients with genotypes B and C has never been studied. Aims: To compare the immune response during the <b>immunoclearance</b> phase of patients with genotypes B and C. Patients and Methods: 20 HBeAg-positive patients with elevated ALT levels, 10 with genotype B and 10 with genotype C, were recruited. Proliferation and Till and Th 2 immune responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured by 3 H-thymidine uptake and ELISPOT assays respectively. The core promoter and precore mutations and HBV DNA levels were determined. Results: The followings are the interim results of first 12 patients (4 and 8 with genotypes B and C respectively). P values were not calculated because of the anlall number of patients. There were no differences in ALT and HBV DNA levels between two groups. Four patients with genotype B and 4 patients with genotype C had precore and core promoter mutations respectively. Compared to patients with genotype C, patients with genotype B had a higher stimulation index (proliferative response) towards HBcAg (4. 6 vs. 2. 7 respectively) and HBeAg (1. 9 vs. 1. 6 respectively). The results of tile ELISPOT assays are listed in the table. Conclusions: Compared to patients with genotype B, patients with genotype C have a lower proliferative response and greater induction of IL- 10 production towards HBcAg and HBeAg. These phenomena may explain the delayed HBeAg seroconversion in patients with genotype C. link_to_subscribed_fulltextThe 40 th Annual Meeting of The European Association for the Study of the Liver, Paris, France, 13 - 17 April 2005.
