The emergence of interconnected ICT support for scientific work and the handling of information have changed the challenges in genomics as well as other scientific fields. The promises are significant but a large degree of uncertainty remains. While the information space is opened up, R&D cooperation essential to reaping the benefits for companies is still difficult. Moreover, in order to benefit in full from the possibility to combine knowledge on a larger scale, knowledge repositories and places of knowledge creation need to be combined. This paper discusses the new strategies of information networking between companies that emerges in response to this challenge. It concludes with an outline of a research agenda for genomics and society...|$|E

In order to increase the level of the society’s aesthetic culture the sensitivity both to long-lasting values and to an artistic innovation should be developed. The article describes the elements of a man’s aesthetic culture (the aesthetic sensitivity, experience, the knowledge concerning art history and theory). The ability to introduce the art connected experiences to a person’s life has been stressed...|$|E
40|$|The Hula wetland, a {{freshwater}} lake {{surrounded by}} swamps in the watershed basin of the Sea of Galilee, was drained in the 1950 s for arable land {{and to reduce}} evaporation, thereby increasing the usable water available. A nature reserve was then designated, but this did not prevent species extinction. Later, severe environmental problems developed in the area; therefore, a rehabilitation project was implemented. The Hula wetland provides a good <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> in ecosystem services under different management regimes and is, therefore, an appropriate setting for analysing trade-offs between different ecosystem services. Before drainage, the wetland provided a variety of ecosystem services. Following drainage, agricultural production services were dominant, but they declined over time. An analysis {{of the impact of}} drainage and rehabilitation on the Hula wetland is presented, and ecosystem service trade-offs that occurred over the past 80 years are evaluated...|$|E

40|$|Modification of a {{high energy}} {{particle}} distribution by a spectrum of low amplitude modes is investigated using a guiding center code. Only through resonance are modes effective in modifying the distribution. Diagnostics are used to illustrate the mode-particle interaction and to find which effects are relevant in producing significant resonance, including kinetic Poincare plots and plots showing those orbits with time averaged mode-particle energy transfer. Effects of pitch angle scattering and drag are studied, as well as plasma rotation and time dependence of the equilibrium and mode frequencies. A specific <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> observed in a DIII-D deuterium beam distribution {{in the presence of}} low amplitude experimentally validated Toroidal Alfven (TAE) eigenmodes and Reversed Shear Alfven (RSAE) eigenmodes is examined in detail. Comparison with experimental data shows that multiple low amplitude modes can account for significant modification of high energy beam particle distributions. It is found that there is a stochastic threshold for beam profile modification, and that the experimental amplitudes are only slightly above this threshold...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the need to}} critically de. ne the bases and contours of 'rights' as created by law. Taking the <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> in Hindu women's position in relation to property through the rights generated by statutory and constitutional provisions, the article critically evaluates the potential for such a 'rights regime' to enable Hindu women's greater access to property. It argues that the idea underlying a particular claim, its legitimacy and therefore effectiveness within a legal framework must be critically evaluated. The legitimacy of claims presumptively conferred within a legal framework must be interrogated {{in the light of}} legal, historical, political and cultural contexts. Such a contextual and critical analysis is crucial for effective protection of rights claims through law. To the extent that legal regimes reflect and substantiate wider social relations, their potential for bringing about substantive change in the lives of women can only be realised through ongoing critical analyses of gender, law and society...|$|E

40|$|The {{rates of}} value added tax (VAT) have {{recently}} {{changed in the}} Czech Republic, and I simulate {{the impact of these}} reforms. They are an <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> in indirect taxes that change the prices of goods and services, to which households can respond by adjusting their expenditures. I first estimate the behavioural response of consumers to price changes in the Czech Republic by applying a consumer demand model of the quadratic almost ideal system (QUAIDS) {{on the basis of the}} Czech Statistical Office household expenditure and price data for the period from 2001 to 2011. I derive estimates of own- and cross-price and income elasticities for individual households. I then use these elasticities to estimate the impact of the changes in VAT rates that were proposed or implemented between 2011 and 2013, on households' quantity demanded and government revenues. One of the main findings is that the estimated increases in government revenues that take the consumer responses into account are more than a quarter lower than the estimates that use the static simulation...|$|E
40|$|The Christianisation of Sweden is {{not much}} about religion. Instead, {{there is much to}} be gained by looking at it as a colonial {{situation}} with changing social identities and power structures. This is evident by the prevalence of hybridisations in the archaeological material. Some of the material categories that show the clearest <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> are the burials from the 9 th century up until about AD 1200. This is exemplified by two different Iron Age burial sites in Stockholm county, Uppland, Sweden: RAÄ 59, Valsta, in Norrsunda parish and RAÄ 40, Lilla Ullevi, in Bro parish; They both show hybridisation by involving older elements with newer ones during a time period when the church was not quite established in the region yet. The Christianisation of Sweden is a colonial situation, but the research tradition has often also used a colonial lens from the 19 th and early 20 th century in its approach to the period. This means that the same questions, interpretations and conclusions, often based on written sources, have been continuously reused for a long time, which has had consequences for the archaeology in Sweden...|$|E
