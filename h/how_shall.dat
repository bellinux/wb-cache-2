She dreaded that her first-born child would never be home again. [...] "My heart seems almost broken... what shall I do? <b>How</b> <b>shall</b> I bear it?

Houston tried to help out by {{assuming}} care of their other children in between his extended visits to Galveston. Her fears seemed well-founded when her son was critically wounded and left for dead at the April 1862 Battle of Shiloh. A second bullet was stopped by his Bible, bearing an inside inscription from Margaret. He was found languishing in a field by a Union Army clergyman who picked up the Bible and also found a letter from Margaret in his pocket. Taken prisoner and sent to Camp Douglas in Illinois, he was later released in a prisoner exchange and received a medical discharge in October.|$|E
500|$|Around this time, Fuller {{was hoping}} to prepare a {{biography}} of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, but felt that she could work on it only if she traveled to Europe. Her father's death and her sudden responsibility for her family caused her to abandon this idea. In 1836, Fuller was given a job teaching at Bronson Alcott's Temple School in Boston, where she remained for a year. She then accepted an invitation to teach under Hiram Fuller (no relation) at the Greene Street School in Providence, Rhode Island, in April 1837 with the unusually high salary of $1,000 per year. Her family sold the Groton farm and Fuller moved with them to Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. On November 6, 1839, Fuller held the first of her [...] "conversations", discussions among local women who met in the Boston home of the Peabodys.

2500|$|In medieval times, {{girls were}} named during Shavua Habat (lit. [...] "week of the daughter"). In early German Jewish communities, [...] a baby naming {{ceremony}} {{was developed for}} both girls and boys called a Hollekreisch, which literally translated to mean the giving of the secular name. The ritual took place after Shabbat lunch. The babies were dressed up, and boys were draped in a tallit. The book of Vayikra (Leviticus) {{was placed in the}} crib. The crib would then be lifted up and the following recited in German: Hollekreisch! <b>How</b> <b>shall</b> the baby be called? So-and-so So-and-so So-and-so (i.e. his or her name three times). Nuts, sweets and fruits were then distributed to the guests. The custom applied to both boys (who had already received their Hebrew names at their brit mila) and girls. This ceremony was widely observed in Jewish circles in Germany as early as the 14th century. In the 17th century this custom was observed in naming boys and girls only in South Germany, while in Austria, Bohemia, Moravia and Poland it was not used for boys, and only rarely for girls.|$|E

2500|$|The Gemara {{interpreted}} the words [...] "knowing {{the mind of}} the most High" [...] in [...] to mean that Balaam knew how to tell the exact moment when God was angry.

[...] The Gemara taught that by the words [...] "that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord," [...] God meant to say to the Israelites, [...] "You should know how many acts of charity I performed for you, in that I did not become angry all that time, in the days of wicked Balaam; for had I become angry at that time, no Israelite would have remained alive or been spared." [...] And the Gemara indicated that this is why Balaam told Balak in [...] "How can I curse whom God has not cursed? or <b>how</b> <b>shall</b> I become angry, when the Lord has not become angry?"
