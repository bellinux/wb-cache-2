Opportunities for improving crisis management capabilities, by new technical and non-technical solutions are strongly influencedby context {{factors such as}} laws, policies, or <b>institutional</b> <b>set-ups.</b> They have influence {{on whether or not}} new solutions are implemented in crisis management, and can moreover determine, if the solution actually improves crisis management performances, once it has been implemented, or if it even promotes negative secondary effects. Resilience of a society is thus strongly dependent on these factors. A general assessment of the current legal and political framework of EU crisis management has been completed, while relevant laws, policies, <b>institutional</b> <b>set-ups,</b> and their interrelations are now being analysed in depth, regarding the implementation of specific tools in crisis management. This work is conducted in the framework of the EU-FP 7 project “DRIVing Innovation in Crisis Management and European Resilience” (DRIVER), which aims firstly, at the development of a European test-bed enabling the benchmarking of new crisis management solutions, and secondly at the actual development of a portfolio of tools that improves crisis management at Member State and EU level...|$|R

50|$|Once the <b>institutional</b> <b>set-up</b> is operational, an LDC can engage, in {{collaboration}} {{with one or more}} of the six core partner agencies, to conduct a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS). The DTIS is a comprehensive analysis of an LDC's economic and trade environment and aims at identifying constraints to competitiveness, supply chain weaknesses and sectors of greatest growth and/or export potential. Each DTIS contains an Action Matrix which outlines priority reforms to be conducted in a certain order to alleviate most binding constraints to greater trade competitiveness. A beneficiary country may request funds of up to USD400,000 to finance the production of a DTIS, or up to USD200,000 for the update of an existing DTIS.|$|E
50|$|The IPCC, in {{its present}} form, {{is in many ways}} an exemplar hybrid institution. The <b>institutional</b> <b>set-up</b> is {{designed}} to achieve consensus and buy-in on a very complex issue. Each chapter must have a lead author from both the global north and south, to help ensure the report reflects the perspectives of both developed and developing countries. The final report must be unanimously agreed upon by both scientists and government representatives, resulting in a document which is “policy relevant but not policy prescriptive”. As with the partnerships discussed previously, the importance of achieving both a balance of input from different sectors, and rules which shape outcomes is evident; demonstrating need for strong, genuinely hybrid institutions.|$|E
5000|$|As {{outlined}} previously, hybrid {{institutions are}} becoming more prominent amid moves away from traditional government towards modes of governance more appropriate for complex issues. For instance, {{a great deal of}} political faith is being placed on hybrid institutions for tackling climate change in the form of carbon markets. Carbon markets are very much hybrid institutions in that they rely on governments to set the “rules for participation”, such as setting the cap or baseline, monitoring, verification and, as seen in the recently announced Australian carbon tax, setting a minimum price for carbon. Only once carbon markets have been “crafted” [...] by political decisions does the market aspect enter into play. The complexity and hybridity of the <b>institutional</b> <b>set-up</b> of carbon markers will be further increased if proposals to link carbon markets from different regions of the world come to fruition.|$|E

50|$|The third {{point is}} of a methodological nature, and is {{probably}} the most important of all. Following the Classical economists, Pasinetti thinks {{that it is possible to}} frame the study of natural economic systems, i.e., economic systems free of institutions. In these natural systems it is possible to deduce a series of characteristics, principles and general laws, which are independent of the institutions that have to be introduced in later stages of investigation. These institutions are the ones that shape the features of real economic systems: for instance, a capitalist system or a socialist system. As he says, “is a distinctive feature of the present theoretical scheme to begin by carrying out the whole analysis at a level of investigation which the Classical economists called ‘natural’, that is to say, at a level of investigation which is so fundamental as to be independent of the <b>institutional</b> <b>set-up</b> of society”.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{argues that}} the need for {{institutional}} capacity-building for development is essential for small island states, more so than larger ones, due mostly to the former’s high degree of exposure to exogenous shocks. Given that small island states tend to depend heavily on international trade, an appropriate <b>institutional</b> <b>set-up</b> for such states would need to be one that promotes competitiveness. Given also that small island states are highly exposed to external shocks, their <b>institutional</b> <b>set-up</b> should promote economic resilience. In addition, given that environmental concerns are so closely interlinked with economic development in small island states, it is essential that the <b>institutional</b> <b>set-up</b> in these states promotes sustainable development. However, the paper also recognises that weaknesses in institutional capacities is a common constraint shared by small island states and this poses a major challenge in responding to the changing international trade environment...|$|E

This I have done through a case based study in Sabah, in which I have interviewed State officers, logging contractors (FMU holders), a local NGO and villagers in the community of Kg. Sinungkalangan (picture in front). It is by comparing the present development with the historical development of land tenure regimes, in terms of natural resource policies and land management schemes and their effects on a local level, I have been able to uncover the dynamics of tenure struggles in Sabah in a politicised perspective. A scenario in which different actors through various <b>institutional</b> <b>set-ups</b> seek to negotiate and re-negotiate access to natural resource through an array of strategies. Looking at how a changing policy climate affects the strategies of State officers, FMU holders and local communities, through an understanding of the many ways in which different actors acquire access to resources by benefiting from various <b>institutional</b> <b>set-ups</b> and symbols, have allowed me to critically assess how these new policies have affected the way in which various actors seek to access and benefit from natural resources on a local level...|$|R

It highlights the normative approach in IWRM policy formulation, the existing institutional barriers to apply it and how these resulted in the framing of IWRM ‘implementation’ as merely a compilation of donor-funded projects. Current discourse on IWRM highlights the need to shift the emphasis from national policy formulation to local adaptive, pragmatic approaches to IWRM.

The study argues for the Property Rights School of thought that the roots of environmental problems are to be traced to inadequate and ill-defined property institutions. The study develops a normative criterion, describing the conditions that are essential for optimal utilisation and conservation of a resource, to be used in assessing the present situation.

40|$|The guiding {{research}} {{question of the}} volume is ‘why does the share of flexible and/or cheap employment differ across occupations?’ (Eichhorst and Marx in this volume). The editors propose two factors that might explain the variety of non-standard employment across occupations: replaceability of workers (as determined by labour supply and demand {{as well as the}} level and type of skills) and flexibility of labour market institutions, which in turn depends on the power of unions and the specific <b>institutional</b> <b>set-up</b> of the industrial relations systems. This chapter elaborates and refines these propositions by exploring how the <b>institutional</b> <b>set-up</b> of a country’s industrial relations and vocational training system shapes the two dimensions of replaceability and flexibility. Whereas the country chapters are concerned with identifying occupation-specific characteristics that are linked to these two dimensions, we argue that the institutional context will influence the relative importance of employment in different occupations associated with non-standard employment.

40|$|Monetary {{institutions}} differ considerably {{between the}} main industrial countries. Differences in preferences, labor market characteristics, political stability {{and the structure}} of the economy make that different countries have different needs. These different needs are also reflected in the design of monetary institutions or, more specifically, central banks. This book takes a political economy view on monetary policy making. Our starting point is that the central bank and rational agents in the private economy interact strategically. The central bank sets monetary policy (usually the rate of inflation) and the private agents rationally form expectations about the rate of inflation.

40|$|According {{to parts}} of the literature, blame {{avoidance}} opportunities, i. e. the necessity and applicability of blame avoidance strategies, may differ among countries according to the respective <b>institutional</b> <b>set-ups</b> and between governing parties according to their programmatic orientation. In countries with many veto actors, a strategy of "Institutional Cooperation" among these actors is expected to diffuse blame sufficiently to render other blame avoidance strategies obsolete. In contrast, governments in Westminster democracies should resort to the more unilateral strategies of presentation, policy design and timing. At the same time, parties of the left {{are expected to have}} an easier time implementing spending cuts while right parties are less vulnerable when proposing tax increases. Evidence from the politics of budget consolidation in Britain and Germany does not corroborate these hypotheses.

40|$|Heckscher-Ohlin trade theory {{by noting}} that much of {{international}} trade, particularly in manufactures, was among similar countries, not between countries with disparate factor endowments (as {{between rich and poor}} countries). His explanation was in terms of demand, more trade taking place among relatively rich countries with similar demand patterns for sophisticated manufactured goods. In the subsequent decades international trade theory incorporated economies of scale and imperfect competition to explain such trade, often in the form of intra-industry trade, rich countries swapping varieties of the same generic goods with one another. Only in recent years the idea is getting around that may be the similarity among rich countries is not so much in demand but in terms of institutions, particularly involving legal and contractual environment relative to that in poor countries.

40|$|We {{examine how}} firms assess {{the value of}} R & D {{partnerships}} with two types of public research organizations: public research institutes (PRIs) and universities. Survey data on Swedish engineering and manufacturing firms suggest that contacts with universities provide firms with impulses to innovation and offer opportunities to learn to a higher extent that contacts with PRIs. Guided by a view of institutes as more oriented towards applied R & D than universities, we also test whether managers perceive institute contacts as contributing more strongly to short-term R & D projects than universities. This hypothesis cannot, however, be verified.

Besides the aforementioned development of commercialisation (Krätli and Swift 2003; Buchanan-Smith and Lind 2005), other studies have documented {{a variety of different}} motives to explain the phenomenon of livestock raiding among pastoralists in Kenya. The spectrum ranges from poverty (Omolo 2010), payment of dowry and accumulation of general wealth (Bollig 1993; Hendrickson et al. 1998) to retaliation (Eaton 2008), tribal-based politics (McCabe 2004), <b>institutional</b> <b>set-ups</b> (Adano et al. 2012), availability of small arms (Mkutu 2006; Gray et al. 2003) and climate change-related (Adano et al. 2012; Campbell et al. 2009; Schilling et al. 2012; Witsenburg and Adano 2009) and unrelated resource degradation (Meier et al. 2007).

40|$|The {{situation}} on the German labour market is still a catastrophe. The <b>institutional</b> <b>set-ups</b> on the labour market and the welfare state obviously no longer fit the fundamentally changed economic environment. There is next to no competition on the labour market and unions and employers' associations use the generous welfare state to transfer the burden of adjustment {{to changes in the}} economic environment onto the public at large. Institutional mismatch is prevalent. The red-green coalition government has not only realized that persistently high unemployment inflicts tremendous economic damage but that it is also politically destabilizing. It has therefore announced that the performance on the labour market during its term of office shall be its own measure of success or failure. This paper discusses whether the regulatory steps taken by the red-green coalition government, like implementing stricter employment protection legislation, reintroducing full pay when sick, and changing the law concerning low-paid jobs, are suitable for reducing this institutional mismatch.

40|$|The present paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the electricity policy of Hong Kong in an environmental-political context. Through a critical review of the policy structure and rationale, it identifies the barriers to developing a truly sustainable electricity policy system and is expected to shed light on the forthcoming electricity market reform in the territory. The barriers stem from the path-dependent <b>institutional</b> <b>set-ups</b> that restrict a timely transformation of the roles of the actors. And this is coupled with the government's treatment that does not look beyond these structural constraints, overly appreciating scientific and economic rationalities than communicative actions. The author is of the view that these are intensified by the sharp changes in the local political economy. Positive signs of change are dampened by the minimal progress in democratic development in the near future and the extension of the power companies' monopolist status that will ruin the 'trust' between the stakeholders compounding the guilt of those rigid regulatory constraints. ...|$|R
