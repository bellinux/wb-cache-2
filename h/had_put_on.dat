5|$|In {{the next}} match against Lancashire, Toshack made four in Australia's 204, before {{claiming}} both openers after they <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> 48, including Test batsman Cyril Washbrook. Toshack ended with 2/40 as the match {{ended in a}} draw after the first day was washed out. It was Australia's first non-victory of the tour. After six consecutive matches {{in the space of}} 21 days, Toshack was rested for the next two matches against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge and Hampshire; the matches ended in a draw and an eight-wicket Australian win respectively.|$|E
5|$|On late June, Louis XIV {{replaced}} Noailles for Louis Joseph, Duke of Vendôme. Noailles charged Saint-Sylvestre of incompetence and, as {{did with}} other high officers, of looting {{the country on}} his own benefit, which <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> arms the peasantry against the French army. On 8 July Vendôme led his troops before Castellfollit. Having expelled its population and eaten horses and mules, the French garrison, diminished by desertions, was in an unsustainable position, and Vendôme came to evacuate and demolish the fortress. After that, the French army took the way to Hostalric and demolished its defenses, returning to Girona on 28 July.|$|E
5|$|Robson {{also used}} her {{protected}} ranking to enter premier clay events in Madrid and Rome, where {{she lost her}} first round matches to Victoria Azarenka and Christina McHale respectively. She <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a promising display against Azarenka, {{but was unable to}} convert 8 out of 9 breakpoints, allowing Azarenka to clinch victory in straight sets. Robson was awarded a wild card into Wimbledon for a second year, but was defeated in 69 minutes by Angelique Kerber in the first round in an error-strewn performance.|$|E

5|$|Washbrook and Hutton put on 168 for {{the first}} wicket, the first time England <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> more than 42 for opening stand, as the hosts went on to make 496, their highest score for the series. Despite this, Australia's batsmen set a world record by chasing down 404 {{on the final day}} to win by seven wickets and take a series-winning 3–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Hutton rocked {{onto the}} front foot, played outside a Johnson off break and was bowled for 20 to leave England at 2/32. The English opener had been {{uncertain}} against Johnson's spin and played forward too early at a slower ball, which went between a gap between his bat and pad. Later in the afternoon, Denis Compton and captain Norman Yardley played Johnson cautiously but safely; in particular, Yardley repeatedly driving a series of overpitched balls from Johnson for runs. Johnson took the last two wickets to fall on the second day, having Alec Coxon caught and bowled for 19 and Laker caught behind for 28 after the pair <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> 41. England were out early on the third morning for 215. Johnson ended with 3/72, having sent down 35 overs, the most by any Australian.|$|E

5|$|Bradman {{thought his}} faster bowlers could not extract much bounce {{from the surface}} and soon removed the short leg fielder, and pursued a 63 {{off-side}} field with three slips and a deep point, trying to encourage the English openers {{to cut through the}} vacant area between the slips and extra cover. However, they declined Bradman's incentive and decided to bat in a low-risk manner, favouring straight-batted shots. After 80 minutes of batting, England's openers reached 50, the first time they <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a half-century in the series. Hutton and Washbrook appeared set for the long haul, and did not react to the applause. They continued on cautiously, and persisted in eschewing the cross-batted cut and pull shots and relying on the safe accumulation of singles.|$|E
5|$|Hutton's {{controversial}} exile thus ended {{after just}} one Test. However, both E. W. Swanton and Bill Bowes believed Hutton {{to be a better}} batsman once he returned to the side. He and Washbrook put on 168 for the first wicket, the first time England <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> more than 42 for the opening stand during the series, as the hosts went on to make 496, their highest score for the series. The pair added another triple-figure partnership in the second innings. Despite this, Australia's batsmen set a world record by chasing down 404 on the final day to win by seven wickets and take a series-winning 3–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Some of Henry Tudor's ships {{ran into}} a storm and were forced to return to Brittany or Normandy, while Henry himself {{anchored}} off Plymouth for a week before learning of Buckingham's failure. Buckingham's army was troubled by the same storm and deserted when Richard's forces came against them. Buckingham tried to escape in disguise, but was either turned in by a retainer for the bounty Richard <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> his head, or was discovered in hiding with him. He was convicted of treason and beheaded in Salisbury, near the Bull's Head Inn, on 2 November. His widow, Catherine Woodville, later married Jasper Tudor, the uncle of Henry Tudor, {{who was in the}} process of organising another rebellion.|$|E

5|$|Sotomayor {{was thus}} {{nominated}} on November 27, 1991, by President George H. W. Bush {{to a seat}} on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated by John M. Walker, Jr. Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, led by a friendly Democratic majority, went smoothly for her in June 1992, with her pro bono activities winning praise from Senator Ted Kennedy and her getting unanimous approval from the committee. Then a Republican senator blocked her nomination and that of three others for a while in retaliation for an unrelated block Democrats <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> another nominee. D'Amato objected strongly; some weeks later, the block was dropped, and Sotomayor was confirmed by unanimous consent of the full United States Senate on August 11, 1992, and received her commission the next day.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match against South Africa, Healy was {{elevated}} two positions to No. 7. Coming in upon {{the fall of}} Cameron, her partner Sarah Elliott was then run out without further addition to the score. Healy hit one boundary and was then out for 8 from 6 balls at 7/151. Her dismissal {{was part of a}} sudden collapse as Australia lost 6/16 including the last four wickets for four runs to be all out for 155 with three balls unused. Healy did not make a dismissal as Australia completed a 22-run win. In the final group match against the West Indies, Healy came in at 6/111 and hit 12 from 8 balls, before being caught from the final ball of the innings as Australia finished on 7/133. She <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> 22 runs in 16 balls with Sthalekar. She caught Deandra Dottin from the bowling of Perry for a golden duck as Australia won by nine runs to finish the group stage unbeaten {{at the top of their}} quartet.|$|E
5|$|In two warm-up matches {{ahead of}} the World Cup in Australia, Ebsary made 18 and 8 against England and Sri Lanka respectively. Nevertheless, Ebsary was {{retained}} for the match against New Zealand, scoring one at No. 7 as Australia failed in their run-chase. It {{was the start of}} a tournament in which Ebsary was moved around in the Australian team structure. Ebsary was dropped for the second match against South Africa, which Australia won, and recalled for the last group match against the West Indies. She made 15 from 28 balls at No. 5, in a 47-run win to reach the next round. In the first Super Six match, Ebsary made 39 not out from 36 balls at No. 7 in the closing stages of the game, attempting to hold together the Australian lower-order as they fell 16 runs short of India's 5/234. She was then promoted to No. 3 in the following match, making 51 from 71 balls against Pakistan after Leah Poulton and Shelley Nitschke <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a century opening stand, as the Australians completed a 107-run win. Ebsary was left out of the final Super Six match against England, which Australia won, which was not enough for them to reach the final. She missed the third-place playoff against India, which was lost. She ended with 106 runs at 35.33 from her four matches.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{known as}} the Indonesian Film Festival Awards, the Citra Award was first given at the IFF in 1955. There were two {{recipients}} that year: A.N. Alcaff of Lewat Djam Malam and A. Hadi of Tarmina. The multiple winners, {{also found in the}} Best Film and Best Leading Actress categories, was controversial; film critics considered Lewat Djam Malam by far the better film and suggested that Djamaluddin Malik's funding of the festival had influenced Tarmina win. Succeeding festivals were held in 1960 and 1967. The IFF was held annually from 1973. Awards were presented at all IFF ceremonies except in 1980; that year, the jury decided that none of the nominated actors <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> performances worthy of the prize. After the 1992 IFF, a sharp decline in film production led the festival to be discontinued. It was reinstated as an annual event in 2004, after receiving funds from the Indonesian government. The most recent winner of this Citra Award is Dedy Soetomo, who was recognised at the 2015 IFF for his performance in Mencari Hilal.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{returned}} {{for the following}} match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test. Australia batted first and reached 7/774 declared, its highest score of the tour, which underpinned a victory by an innings and 363 runs. Johnson made 27, after coming in at 6/669 and playing a supporting role in a 105-run partnership with Sam Loxton, who made 159 not out. Acting captain Hassett declared without further addition to the score after Johnson fell at 7/774. Johnson {{played a leading role}} with the ball, taking his only ten-wicket match haul for the tour. After the hosts’ openers <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> 74, Johnson removed both in quick succession to leave Gloucestershire at 2/79. He later took the last three wickets as Gloucestershire collapsed from 6/257 to be all out for 269. Johnson had totalled 6/68 from 31.4 overs. Hassett elected to enforce the follow on and the home side reached 2/72 before Johnson took five of the last eight wickets to help end the innings for 132. Johnson ended with 5/32 from 17.1 overs for a match total of 11/100. Johnson took his 50th wicket for the tour during the fixture and was on 57 {{by the end of the}} game, the 18th of 31 first-class matches on the tour.|$|E
5|$|The {{afternoon}} session {{continued with}} further spectator encroachments. After lunch, Bradman set defensive fields {{with the intent}} of restricting the scoring, and used his remaining bowlers in short spells to conserve their energy, expecting a long day in the field. The absence of Toshack also meant Loxton had a substantial workload with the ball. The English batsmen continued to accelerate, and when Bradman finally brought Johnson into the attack, they targeted him. Washbrook hit a straight six from Johnson, and Hutton followed suit to take England from 98 to 104. For the second time in the match, the English openers <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a century stand, and the shot also brought up Hutton's 50 in 125 minutes. This feat made Hutton and Washbrook the first pair to make century opening partnerships in both innings of a Test on two occasions; they had done this for the first time against Australia in the Fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval in 194647. Bradman replaced Johnson with Lindwall immediately, and Washbrook responded by cutting the paceman for four to reach his half-century. Lindwall responded with two bouncers. Washbrook then hooked one a short ball from Johnston and got a top edge, but Bradman failed to take the catch.|$|E

5|$|With Keith Miller {{injured and}} playing purely as a batsman, Johnston took the new ball, {{sharing it with}} Lindwall. He was unable to take a wicket initially, but the English openers were uncomfortable when he and Lindwall were taking the new ball. Following the tea break, he {{returned}} with the second new ball after Compton and Yardley <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> an 87-run partnership to stabilise the middle-order. Johnston took Compton's outside edge and Miller completed the catch in slips. The left armer then claimed Evans, caught by a diving Miller after the Englishman had taken a swing of the bat wide outside off stump; this left the hosts at 7/145. Johnston ended with 2/43 from 22 overs as England were bowled for at 215 early on the third morning. After Australia declared at 7/460 on the fourth afternoon to leave the home side a target of 596, Johnston troubled the English openers with the new ball, but did not take a wicket.|$|E
