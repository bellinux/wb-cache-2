5000|$|The series divided reviewers in Denmark; {{some were}} enthusiastic, praising the lavish cinematography, while others {{considered}} the cost {{should have been}} used for other programming, especially more Scandinavian noir. Some Danish critics and historians felt that the series contained historical inaccuracies, particularly in its assertion that <b>excessive</b> <b>nationalism</b> drove Denmark into a war that was bound to end in defeat. The 1864 war {{had a profound effect on}} Denmark, setting the country's course for its modern development. As a result Tom Buk-Swienty, the series' historical consultant, believed that that sort of debate was inevitable. On the other hand, producer Peter Bose commented that [...] "we were expecting debates but were rather surprised by the continuous bashing".|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the flag}} {{being used by the}} Imperial Japanese {{military}} and Japan's actions during World War II, many Koreans, whose country had been oppressed under Japanese rule, and Chinese find the flag to be offensive. Because of this, the use of the flag is considered to be controversial. Although they protest the rising sun flag, no country prohibits from using it by law. Moreover, the South Korean Navy's position is that there are no problems with the carrying of the rising sun flag by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force warships. It would be an infringement of sovereignty if the Korean Navy requested to not carry the rising sun flag. An analysis indicates that Korean reactions to the rising sun flag stem from the complicating emotion of <b>excessive</b> <b>nationalism</b> and nationalistic complex toward Japan.|$|E
50|$|Public criticisms include Amy Beegle's (2004) {{documentation}} of musical propaganda in American schools during World War II, and suggestion that music educators should “reflect upon {{the experiences of}} past generations” (p. 67). Later, Jere Humphreys remarked that “the National Anthem Project sends questionable messages during this time of controversy during a foreign war and the reduction of civil liberties at home and abroad” and warned against the “messages and images this campaign engenders” (Humphreys, 2006, p. 183). More recently, Carlos Abril (2007) cautioned {{that most of the}} Project's efforts “propel absolutist views in which declared truths take a front seat to divergent understandings and discoveries” (p. 81). Estelle Jorgensen (2007) also wrote that “selecting The Star-Spangled Banner as the focus of a national campaign to teach the nation to sing can be read as too narrow an objective in that it forwards the limited claims of nationalism to the exclusion of building international and local affiliations and identities. Rather, music teachers need to resist the claims of <b>excessive</b> <b>nationalism</b> {{in order to ensure that}} these other interests are also served.” (p. 153).|$|E
5000|$|In September 1938 Pope Pius XI, {{speaking}} {{to a group of}} Belgian pilgrims, denounced anti-Semitism explicitly, saying that it was incompatible with Christianity. Influenced by this statement, a group of American bishops released a statement encouraging Catholics to, [...] "guard against all forms of racial bigotry." [...] Inspired by the statement of the bishops, the Committee of Catholics to Fight Anti-Semitism was formed in May 1939 by Dorothy Day, Catherine Doherty, other supporters of the Catholic Worker Movement, and Emmanuel Chapman, professor at Fordham University, who was its first executive secretary. [...] Also included among the founders were artists, philosophers, writers and, according to Day, [...] "a long list of priests and nuns." [...] In August 1939 the group changed its name to the Committee of Catholics for Human Rights. Millions of citizens throughout the world are no longer considered as inviolable persons: they are mere things to be juggled at will by gangster governments. Atheism, Communism, Nazism, <b>excessive</b> <b>nationalism</b> and arrogant militarism have brought back to the civilized world the servitude of man. The anti-Semite, like the atheist and the Communist, refuses to recognize in his neighbor the image and likeness of God. Robert Emmet Lucey, Bishop of Amarillo, writing in The Voice, 1940.|$|E
5000|$|Solana’s thought {{contained}} a strong anti-tyrannical thread, embodied {{already in the}} concept of a moderated monarchy; he also largely ignored his rival to the title of key party pundit, Víctor Pradera, whose thought endorsed dictatorial solutions. During the Republic Solana produced a treaty on the right to resist and to overthrow a despotic regime. However, an entirely new element introduced to Traditionalism was spelling out its incompatibility with totalitarian concepts. He went to great lengths denouncing Soviet, Fascist and Nazi regimes, claiming that the tyranny and deification of state which they introduce, combined with <b>excessive</b> <b>nationalism,</b> render them [...] "irreconcilable Traditionalist enemies". Manuscript of his key theoretical work, completed in 1938, in its epilogue {{contained a}} veiled warning to Franco; it noted that Traditionalists would never support a regime based on foreign ideas, lamented [...] "espantosa guerra civil que desangra a la Patria" [...] and feared [...] "que tanta sangre y tantas ruínas y tantas desgracias" [...] might turn useless.Like some Traditionalists, Solana welcomed democracy though he understood it simply as a principle of representation. Other a bit unorthodox piece of his concepts were references to [...] "derechos del hombre", praise of religious and educational liberties (though [...] "rectamente entendida" [...] and [...] "para fínes lícitos"), notes that a human was the end and not the means and that [...] "sociedad es para el hombre y no al revés". Some of his writings contain highly exalted passages on exceptional role of the Spaniards, comments resemblant of typical nationalist discourse and quite atypical for Traditionalism. Finally, as member of the movement which prided itself on belligerent past Solana was unusually bold in condemnation of [...] "espiritú de violencia"; though he applied it mostly to foreign ideas, he was also careful to note that notorious [...] "Traditionalist intransigency" [...] had its limits. Last but not least, he considered himself a Traditionalist rather than a Carlist.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{combination}} of historical and psychoanalytical tools, this article explores the national defence mechanisms used by the education system of the Yishuv, the Jewish community in pre-independence Israel, {{in response to the}} Holocaust (1943 - 1948). The article also explores the significance of these responses, as well as their contemporary implications. Three personal defence mechanisms will be identified for the purpose of analysing the reactions of the Israelis as a national group. 'Denial' as a whole is generally associated with the defence of various systems, with 'splitting' and 'narcissism' being two facets of <b>excessive</b> <b>nationalism.</b> The article concludes with contemporary applications of national defence mechanisms and their possible educational uses: community emphasis, educational periodisation, and, above all, recognition of the need to consider national defence mechanisms when planning educational responses to national crises. It is proposed that the educational model presented has wider applications, beyond the case of Israel and the Holocaust. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This article {{compares the}} ways in which {{references}} to ‘the (British) Empire’ were constructed and used in interview accounts of national identity and domestic politics in Scotland and in England. In Scotland, spontaneous accounts of Empire were typically formulated in conjunction with nationalist moral meta-narratives. Respondents variously inferred heroic national character from Scotland's role in Empire, or cast Scottish history as an enduring struggle between progressive forces of nationalism and atavistic forces of Anglo-British colonialism. The construct of Britishness was often seen to derive from, and to be synonymous with, the history of Empire. In England, the Empire story tended to be framed within anti-nationalist meta-narratives. Imperialism was generally understood to represent a product of <b>excessive</b> <b>nationalism,</b> and tales of Empire were used to draw exemplary moral lessons concerning the deficiencies of Anglo-British national character and of the catastrophic consequences of the pursuit of national self-interest more generally. The existence of Britain, and the construct of Britishness, were generally understood to both predate and postdate the history of Empire...|$|E
