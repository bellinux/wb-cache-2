50|$|In 1992 Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad {{successor}} Chicago and North Western determined {{there was}} insufficient traffic on their line to continue operations, and abandoned the track, including removing the <b>diamond</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>with</b> Burlington Northern Railroad at Crawford. A {{portion of the}} route from Crawford to Chadron would again see life when revived by the regional Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad, which in April 2010 handed over operations to shortline operators Nebraska Northwestern Railroad and Nebkota Railway. As of 2014, both continued interchange of grain and merchandise by boxcar at Crawford.|$|R

Cap Metro {{currently}} runs commuter rail and freight rail operations through McNeil. Freight operations on Cap Metro are operated under contract by Austin Western Railroad. Commuter rail operations use an overpass built in 2007 over the UP tracks. Freight operations use a <b>diamond</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>with</b> UP. Freight is interchanged between UP and Austin Western. BNSF serves Austin Western via trackage rights over UP.|$|R

40|$|Prismatic {{dislocation}} {{structures are}} often observed after indentation experiments. These structures usually {{start from the}} zone of high dislocation density underneath an indenter tip, but extend far beyond. Three dimensional Discrete Dislocation Dynamics simulations show how these complex structures can be formed from preexisting dislocations. The specifics of the indentation stress field and the crystallographic orientation {{play an important role}} for the formation of these structures. The mechanism of formation of the prismatic dislocations loops is dominated by stress controlled <b>cross</b> <b>slip</b> events, <b>with</b> <b>cross</b> <b>slip</b> locations reflecting the symmetry of the indentation stress field...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Diamond</b> <b>Cross</b> is an {{asterism}} in {{the southern}} constellation Carina. The <b>Diamond</b> <b>Cross</b> is composed of four bright stars: Beta, Theta, Upsilon and Omega Carinae. These four bright stars create an almost perfect diamond shape, hence the name [...] "Diamond Cross". The entire asterism is visible to all observers south of 20°N latitude. It bears {{a striking resemblance to}} Crux (The Southern Cross) and the False Cross, and, like them, it lacks a central star in its cross pattern, creating a diamond-shaped or kite-like appearance. Both the <b>Diamond</b> <b>Cross</b> and the False Cross are sometimes mistaken for the true cross Crux, although the False Cross has always been a worse deceiver than the <b>Diamond</b> <b>Cross,</b> because most of its stars have approximately the same declinations as the stars of Crux.|$|R

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said the following about 200 Greenwich Street's wedged rooftop: [...] "Designed by Lord Foster, the tower incorporates WTC master planner Daniel Libeskind's 'wedge of light' concept, and will cast no shadow on the memorial park on September 11." [...] The total floor space of 200 Greenwich Street was anticipated to include 2400000 ft2 m2 of office space and another 130000 ft2 m2 for retail shops and access areas to the underground World Trade Center PATH station.|$|R
