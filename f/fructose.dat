5|$|Both {{lifestyle}} changes and medications can decrease uric acid levels. Dietary and lifestyle choices that are effective include reducing intake of purine-rich foods {{of animal origin}} such as meat and seafood, alcohol, and <b>fructose</b> (especially high <b>fructose</b> corn syrup). Eating dairy products, vitamin C, coffee, and cherries may help prevent gout attacks, as does losing weight. Gout may be secondary to sleep apnea via the release of purines from oxygen-starved cells. Treatment of apnea can lessen the occurrence of attacks.|$|E
5|$|Claims {{have been}} made of a sugar–Alzheimer's disease connection, but debate {{continues}} over whether cognitive decline is attributable to dietary <b>fructose</b> or to overall energy intake.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fructose,</b> {{or fruit}} sugar, occurs {{naturally}} in fruits, some root vegetables, cane sugar and honey {{and is the}} sweetest of the sugars. It {{is one of the}} components of sucrose or table sugar. It is used as a high-fructose syrup, which is manufactured from hydrolyzed corn starch that has been processed to yield corn syrup, with enzymes then added to convert part of the glucose into <b>fructose.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sucrose {{is found}} in the stems of {{sugarcane}} and roots of sugar beet. It also occurs naturally alongside <b>fructose</b> and glucose in other plants, in particular fruits and some roots such as carrots. The different proportions of sugars found in these foods determines the range of sweetness experienced when eating them. A molecule of sucrose is formed by the combination of a molecule of glucose with a molecule of <b>fructose.</b> After being eaten, sucrose is split into its constituent parts during digestion by a number of enzymes known as sucrases.|$|E
5|$|The fructose/glucose {{ratio is}} {{calculated}} {{by dividing the}} sum of free <b>fructose</b> plus half sucrose by the sum of free glucose plus half sucrose.|$|E
5|$|Carrots are 88% water, 4.7% sugar, 0.9% protein, 2.8% {{dietary fiber}}, 1% ash and 0.2% fat. Carrot dietary fiber {{comprises}} mostly cellulose, with smaller proportions of hemicellulose, lignin and starch. Free sugars in carrot include sucrose, glucose and <b>fructose.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{chemical}} reactions involving hydrochloric acid are {{applied in the}} production of food, food ingredients, and food additives. Typical products include aspartame, <b>fructose,</b> citric acid, lysine, hydrolyzed vegetable protein as food enhancer, and in gelatin production. Food-grade (extra-pure) hydrochloric acid can be applied when needed for the final product.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{ingredient}} in maple syrup is the sap from the xylem of sugar maple or various {{other species of}} maple trees. It consists primarily of sucrose and water, with small amounts of the monosaccharides glucose and <b>fructose</b> from the invert sugar created in the boiling process.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates are {{aldehydes}} or ketones, {{with many}} hydroxyl groups attached, that can exist as straight chains or rings. Carbohydrates {{are the most}} abundant biological molecules, and fill numerous roles, such as the storage and transport of energy (starch, glycogen) and structural components (cellulose in plants, chitin in animals). The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides and include galactose, <b>fructose,</b> and most importantly glucose. Monosaccharides can be linked together to form polysaccharides in almost limitless ways.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fructose,</b> galactose, and glucose are all simple sugars, monosaccharides, {{with the}} general formula C6H12O6. They have five {{hydroxyl}} groups (−OH) and a carbonyl group (C=O) and are cyclic when dissolved in water. They each exist as several isomers with dextro- and laevo-rotatory forms that cause polarized light to diverge to the right or the left.|$|E
5|$|Maltose {{is formed}} during the {{germination}} of certain grains, {{the most notable}} being barley, which is converted into malt, {{the source of the}} sugar's name. A molecule of maltose is formed by the combination of two molecules of glucose. It is less sweet than glucose, <b>fructose</b> or sucrose. It is formed in the body during the digestion of starch by the enzyme amylase and is itself broken down during digestion by the enzyme maltase.|$|E
5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 {{hours or}} more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet <b>fructose.</b> The cooked stems or rhizomes were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry until {{the time came to}} add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said to smell and taste like molasses.|$|E
5|$|Monosaccharides in a closed-chain form {{can form}} glycosidic bonds with other monosaccharides, {{creating}} disaccharides (such as sucrose) and polysaccharides (such as starch). Enzymes must hydrolyze or otherwise break these glycosidic bonds before such compounds become metabolized. After digestion and absorption the principal monosaccharides {{present in the}} blood and internal tissues include glucose, <b>fructose,</b> and galactose. Many pentoses and hexoses can form ring structures. In these closed-chain forms, the aldehyde or ketone group remains non-free, {{so many of the}} reactions typical of these groups cannot occur. Glucose in solution exists mostly in the ring form at equilibrium, with less than 0.1% of the molecules in the open-chain form.|$|E
5|$|Tooth decay {{is caused}} by certain types of acid-producing {{bacteria}} which cause the most damage {{in the presence of}} fermentable carbohydrates such as sucrose, <b>fructose,</b> and glucose. The resulting acidic levels in the mouth affect teeth because a tooth's special mineral content causes it to be sensitive to low pH. Depending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to restore teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known method to regenerate large amounts of tooth structure. Instead, dental health organizations advocate preventative and prophylactic measures, such as regular oral hygiene and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrate {{catabolism}} is {{the breakdown}} of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and <b>fructose</b> are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA through aerobic (with oxygen) glycolysis and fed into the citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are also}} {{important}} in metabolic control. Many metabolic pathways in the cell are inhibited by metabolites that control enzyme activity through allosteric regulation or substrate inhibition. A good example is the allosteric regulation of the glycolytic pathway. This catabolic pathway consumes glucose and produces ATP, NADH and pyruvate. A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1). When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an allosteric site in PFK1 to decrease {{the rate of the}} enzyme reaction; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls. This negative feedback control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP in the cell. However, metabolic pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important. With respect to PFK1, <b>fructose</b> 2,6-bisphosphate and ADP are examples of metabolites that are allosteric activators.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers aim for a {{moisture}} content of 50-to-52 percent and a fat-in-dry-matter content of 35-to-40 percent. A {{study published in}} the International Journal of Food & Science Technology found that a 12.5:87.5 blend of vetch milk and bovine milk improved stretchiness and melting characteristics. Vetch is a legume that has seeds which are similar to lentils. An experiment published in the International Journal of Dairy Technology suggested that the level of galactose, a monosaccharide sugar that is less sweet than glucose and <b>fructose,</b> can be reduced using different culture techniques. An article in the International Journal of Food Engineering found that trisodium citrate, a food additive used to preserve and add flavor to foods, slightly improved the preferred qualities of pizza cheese. Research published in Dairy Industries International suggested that denatured whey proteins increased moisture retention, but that the improvements were very slight and not economically worthwhile relative to the minor improvements.|$|E
5|$|The {{light energy}} {{captured}} by chlorophyll a is initially {{in the form}} of electrons (and later a proton gradient) that's used to make molecules of ATP and NADPH which temporarily store and transport energy. Their energy is used in the light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle by the enzyme rubisco to produce molecules of the 3-carbon sugar glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is the first product of photosynthesis and the raw material from which glucose and almost all other organic molecules of biological origin are synthesised. Some of the glucose is converted to starch which is stored in the chloroplast. Starch is the characteristic energy store of most land plants and algae, while inulin, a polymer of <b>fructose</b> is used for the same purpose in the sunflower family Asteraceae. Some of the glucose is converted to sucrose (common table sugar) for export {{to the rest of the}} plant.|$|E
25|$|The USDA food {{database}} {{reveals that}} many common fruits contain nearly {{equal amounts of}} the <b>fructose</b> and glucose, {{and they do not}} present problems for those individuals with <b>fructose</b> malabsorption. Some fruits with a greater ratio of <b>fructose</b> than glucose are apples, pears and watermelon, which contain {{more than twice as much}} <b>fructose</b> as glucose. <b>Fructose</b> levels in grapes varies depending on ripeness and variety, where unripe grapes contain more glucose.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fructose</b> {{is absorbed}} in the small {{intestine}} without help of digestive enzymes. Even in healthy persons, however, only about 25–50g of <b>fructose</b> per sitting can be properly absorbed. People with <b>fructose</b> malabsorption absorb less than 25g per sitting. Simultaneous ingestion of <b>fructose</b> and sorbitol seems to increase malabsorption of <b>fructose.</b> <b>Fructose</b> {{that has not been}} adequately absorbed is fermented by intestinal bacteria producing hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and short-chain fatty acids. This abnormal increase in hydrogen may be detectable with the hydrogen breath test.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fructose</b> {{malabsorption}} {{is not to}} {{be confused}} with hereditary <b>fructose</b> intolerance, a potentially fatal condition in which the liver enzymes that break up <b>fructose</b> are deficient.|$|E
25|$|The average {{ratio was}} 56% <b>fructose</b> to 44% glucose, but the ratios in the {{individual}} honeys ranged {{from a high of}} 64% <b>fructose</b> and 36% glucose (one type of flower honey; table 3 in reference) to a low of 50% <b>fructose</b> and 50% glucose (a different floral source). This NMR method was not able to quantify maltose, galactose, and the other minor sugars as compared to <b>fructose</b> and glucose.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} cure, but an {{appropriate}} diet and the enzyme xylose isomerase can help. The ingestion of glucose simultaneously with <b>fructose</b> improves <b>fructose</b> absorption and may prevent {{the development of}} symptoms. For example, people may tolerate fruits such as grapefruits or bananas, which contain similar amounts of <b>fructose</b> and glucose, but apples are not tolerated because they contain high levels of <b>fructose</b> {{and lower levels of}} glucose.|$|E
25|$|Foods and {{beverages}} containing greater than 0.5 g <b>fructose</b> {{in excess of}} glucose per 100g and greater than 0.2 g of fructans per serving should be avoided. Foods with >3 g of <b>fructose</b> per serving are termed a 'high <b>fructose</b> load' and possibly present a risk of inducing symptoms. However, {{the concept of a}} 'high <b>fructose</b> load' has not been evaluated in terms of its importance in the success of the diet.|$|E
25|$|Foods {{with a high}} glucose content {{ingested}} with foods containing excess <b>fructose</b> {{may help}} sufferers absorb the excess <b>fructose.</b>|$|E
25|$|Xylose {{isomerase}} acts {{to convert}} <b>fructose</b> sugars into glucose. Dietary supplements of xylose isomerase may improve {{the symptoms of}} <b>fructose</b> malabsorption.|$|E
25|$|Mannitol is {{commonly}} produced via the hydrogenation of <b>fructose,</b> which is formed from either starch or sucrose (common table sugar). Although starch is a cheaper source than sucrose, {{the transformation of}} starch is much more complicated. Eventually, it yields a syrup containing about 42% <b>fructose,</b> 52% glucose, and 6% maltose. Sucrose is simply hydrolyzed into an invert sugar syrup, which contains about 50% <b>fructose.</b> In both cases, the syrups are chromatographically purified to contain 90–95% <b>fructose.</b> The <b>fructose</b> is then hydrogenated over a nickel catalyst into a mixture of isomers sorbitol and mannitol. Yield is typically 50%:50%, although slightly alkaline reaction conditions can slightly increase mannitol yields.|$|E
25|$|High <b>fructose</b> syrup, made by {{treating}} dextrose solutions with the enzyme glucose isomerase, until a substantial {{fraction of the}} glucose has been converted to <b>fructose.</b>|$|E
25|$|G6P is then rearranged into <b>fructose</b> 6-{{phosphate}} (F6P) by glucose phosphate isomerase. <b>Fructose</b> {{can also}} enter the glycolytic pathway by phosphorylation at this point.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fructose</b> and glucose: Glucose and <b>fructose</b> {{significantly}} {{inhibit the}} metabolic changes produced by alcohol intoxication, nevertheless {{they have no}} significant effect on hangover severity.|$|E
25|$|The thick {{secretions}} {{from the}} seminal vesicles contain proteins, enzymes, <b>fructose,</b> mucus, vitamin C, flavins, phosphorylcholine and prostaglandins. The high <b>fructose</b> concentrations provide nutrient {{energy for the}} spermatozoa when stored in semen in the laboratory.|$|E
25|$|The {{role that}} fructans play in <b>fructose</b> {{malabsorption}} {{is still under}} investigation. However, {{it is recommended that}} fructan intake for <b>fructose</b> malabsorbers should be kept to less than 0.5nbsp&grams/serving, and supplements with inulin and fructooligosaccharide (FOS), both fructans, should be avoided.|$|E
25|$|Foods {{containing}} high <b>fructose</b> corn syrup.|$|E
25|$|Inborn {{errors of}} {{metabolism}} such as <b>fructose</b> malabsorption.|$|E
25|$|Sucrose {{is formed}} by plants and {{cyanobacteria}} {{but not by}} other organisms. Sucrose is found naturally in many food plants along with the monosaccharide <b>fructose.</b> In many fruits, such as pineapple and apricot, sucrose is the main sugar. In others, such as grapes and pears, <b>fructose</b> is the main sugar.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fructose</b> is {{obtainable}} from glucose, {{a building}} block in cellulose.|$|E
