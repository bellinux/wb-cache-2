5|$|The Bab had {{appointed}} Mírzá Yahyá (later {{known as}} Subh-i-Azal) {{as the leader}} after himself. Mírzá Yahyá had gone into hiding after the assassination attempt on the Shah, and after Bahá'u'lláh's exile to Baghdad, he chose to join his brother there. At the same time, {{an increasing number of}} Bábís considered Baghdad the new center for leadership of the Bábí religion, and a flow of pilgrims started <b>going</b> <b>there</b> from Persia.|$|E
5|$|After Bart and Lisa see Krusty the Clown do {{his show}} at the Mt.

The family goes to Mt. Splashmore, where Bart, Lisa and Homer ride an intense water slide named H2WHOA!. Due to his weight, Homer gets lodged in the water slide mid-course and the park's rescue crew are forced {{to shut down the}} ride and remove him {{with the help of a}} large crane. Homer is made a fool of on the news for his massive size and admits that he needs to lose weight.|$|E
5|$|I {{asked him}} not {{to go into that}} field, that you were <b>going</b> <b>there.</b> He laughed at the idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E

5|$|In a {{story from}} the Shakta Maha-Bhagavata Purana, which narrates the {{creation}} of all the Mahavidyas, Sati, the daughter of Daksha and first wife of god Shiva, feels insulted that she and Shiva are not invited to Daksha's yagna ("fire sacrifice") and insists on <b>going</b> <b>there,</b> despite Shiva's protests. After futile attempts to convince Shiva, the enraged Sati transforms into the Mahavidyas, who surround Shiva from the ten cardinal directions. Dhumavati stands in the southeast. Another similar legend replaces Sati with Kali (the chief Mahavidya) as the wife of Shiva and origin of the other Mahavidyas. The Devi Bhagavata Purana mentions the Mahavidyas as war-companions and forms of goddess Shakambhari.|$|E
5|$|Scarlett is widowed when Charles dies from {{a bout of}} {{pneumonia}} and measles while serving in the Confederate Army. Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in Atlanta to cheer her up, although the O'Haras' outspoken housemaid Mammy tells Scarlett she knows she is <b>going</b> <b>there</b> only to wait for Ashley's return. Scarlett, who should not attend a party while in mourning, attends a charity bazaar in Atlanta with Melanie where she meets Rhett again, now a blockade runner for the Confederacy. Celebrating a Confederate victory and {{to raise money for}} the Confederate war effort, gentlemen are invited to bid for ladies to dance with them. Rhett makes an inordinately large bid for Scarlett and, to the disapproval of the guests, she agrees to dance with him.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the operation of Mountain Grove Campground, the majority of people traveling there were worshipers. In the 1870s and 1880s, the campground was one of the three largest camp meeting sites that residents of Columbia County attended. In 1875, approximately 2500 people attended the camp meeting. In 1881, it was decided that all the profit generated from the campground would be dedicated to expansion and improvement of it. In 1891, the duration of the camp meeting was increased from seven to thirteen days. However, some people traveled there for a vacation. Within 20 years of the campground's opening, {{the majority of the people}} <b>going</b> <b>there</b> were there for a vacation, and trains carried bands and other entertainment-related items to the campground. However, people still continued to go there in large numbers for camp meeting. Local newspapers also began to advertise the campground as a resort instead of a camp meeting site. This began with an advertisement written by John R. Rote, secretary of the Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association, in the Columbia County Republican on July 9, 1891.|$|E

5|$|Prospects for a {{successful}} release did not look good. Aykroyd and Belushi had left SNL {{at the end of}} the previous season, reducing their bankability. Belushi's fame had taken a further hit after the commercial and critical failure of 1941 {{at the end of the}} year. One day after the editing was done, Wasserman invited Landis up to his office to speak with Ted Mann, head of the Mann Theatres chain, which dominated film exhibition in the Western United States. He told Landis that he would not book the film at any theaters in predominantly white neighborhoods, such as Westwood. Not only did Mann not want black patrons <b>going</b> <b>there</b> to see the film, he surmised that white viewers were unlikely to see a film featuring older black musical stars. Ultimately The Blues Brothers got less than half the bookings nationwide for its initial release than a typical big-budget studio film of the era, which did not bode well for its success at the box office.|$|E

For example, yet another order, ne iris mi, would suggest that the possibility of not having gone was under discussion, and mi is given as an example of one who did not go.|$|E

Sleipner departed Lerwick at 0900hrs on 27 April and arrived at Scapa Flow at 1700hrs the same day. The Norwegian destroyer left Scapa Flow for the Tyne at 1330hrs on 30 April.

The land is snow-covered throughout (northern Siberia) and {{the only means of}} transport is dog-drawn sled. There lived a mysterious people who were reluctant to show themselves. They traded with southern people in a peculiar way. Southern merchants brought various goods and placed them in an open area on the snow in the night, then returned to their tents. Next morning they came to the place again and found their merchandise taken by the mysterious people, but in exchange they found fur-skins which could be used for making valuable coats, jackets, and other winter garments. The trade is done between merchants and the mysterious people without seeing each other. As Ibn Battuta was not a merchant and saw no benefit of <b>going</b> <b>there</b> he abandoned the travel to this land of darkness.|$|E

25|$|On 31 July 1960, Valentino met Giancarlo Giammetti at the Café de Paris on the Via Veneto in Rome. One {{of three}} children, Giammetti {{was in his}} second year of {{architecture}} school, living at home with his parents in the haut bourgeois Parioli section of Northern Rome. That day Giammetti gave Valentino a lift home in his Fiat and a friendship, as well as a long-lasting partnership, started. The day after, Giammetti was to leave for Capri for vacation and, by coincidence, Valentino was also <b>going</b> <b>there,</b> so they met again on the island 10 days later. Giammetti would shortly thereafter abandon the University to become Valentino's business partner. When Giammetti arrived, the business situation of Valentino's atelier was in fact not brilliant: in one year he had spent so much money that his father's associate pulled out of the business, and had to fight against bankruptcy.|$|E

Kindly observe the final {{wishes of the}} {{undersigned}} and avoid reading the so-called Christian burial service which, {{in view of the}} language employed in it, I regard {{as one of the most}} cruel and paganish things inherited by our forebears from our remote pagan ancestors. In deference to the faith of our dear mother who was through her lifetime a loyal though never bigoted communicant of that congregation, perhaps the current pastor of the First Presbyterian Church would consent to read the Twenty-third Psalm, which was her favorite passage in the Scriptures and is mine since it contains no charnel words, no morbid mouthings about corruption and decay and, being mercifully without creed or dogma, carries no threat of eternal hell-fire for those parties we do not like, no direct promise of a heaven which, if one may judge by the people who are surest of <b>going</b> <b>there,</b> must be a powerfully dull place, populated to a considerable and uncomfortable degree by prigs, time-servers and unpleasantly aggressive individuals. Hell may have a worse climate but undoubtedly the company is sprightlier. The Catholics, with their genius for stage-management, handle this detail better. The officiating clergyman speaks in Latin and the parishioners, being unacquainted with that language are impressed by the majesty of the rolling, sonorous periods without being shocked by tressing allusions and harrowing references.|$|E
