Imaging detectors such as those used for radiography were originally based on photographic plates and later photographic film, but are now mostly replaced by various digital detector types such as image plates and flat panel detectors. For radiation protection direct exposure hazard is often evaluated using ionization chambers, while dosimeters are {{used to measure the}} radiation dose a person has been exposed to.

25|$|In {{capacitors}} {{in which}} the internal pressure build-up {{was so great that}} the capacitor case was already bulging but the vent had not opened yet, the pH value of the electrolyte could be measured. The electrolyte of the faulty Taiwanese capacitors was alkaline, with a pH of between 7 and 8. Good comparable Japanese capacitors had an electrolyte that was acidic, with a pH of around 4. As it is known that aluminum can be dissolved by alkaline liquids, but not that which is mildly acidic, an <b>energy</b> <b>dispersive</b> X-ray spectroscopy (EDX or EDS) fingerprint analysis of the electrolyte of the faulty capacitors was made, which detected dissolved aluminum in the electrolyte.|$|E
25|$|In <b>energy</b> <b>dispersive</b> analysis, {{dispersion}} and detection are {{a single}} operation, {{as already mentioned}} above. Proportional counters or various types of solid-state detectors (PIN diode, Si(Li), Ge(Li), Silicon Drift Detector SDD) are used. They all share the same detection principle: An incoming X-ray photon ionises {{a large number of}} detector atoms with the amount of charge produced being proportional to the energy of the incoming photon. The charge is then collected and the process repeats itself for the next photon. Detector speed is obviously critical, as all charge carriers measured have to come from the same photon to measure the photon energy correctly (peak length discrimination is used to eliminate events that seem to have been produced by two X-ray photons arriving almost simultaneously). The spectrum is then built up by dividing the energy spectrum into discrete bins and counting the number of pulses registered within each energy bin. EDXRF detector types vary in resolution, speed and the means of cooling (a low number of free charge carriers is critical in the solid state detectors): proportional counters with resolutions of several hundred eV cover {{the low end of the}} performance spectrum, followed by PIN diode detectors, while the Si(Li), Ge(Li) and Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD) occupy the high end of the performance scale.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{explore the}} use of crystal inter-planar d-spacings and slip-plane {{interaction}} energies for predicting and characterising mechanical properties of crystalline solids. METHODS: Potential relationships were evaluated between mechanical properties and inter-planar d-spacing, inter-planar interaction <b>energy,</b> and <b>dispersive</b> surface <b>energy</b> as determined using inverse gas chromatography (IGC) {{for a set of}} pharmaceutical materials. Inter-planar interaction energies were determined by molecular modelling. RESULTS: General trends were observed between mechanical properties and the largest inter-planar d-spacing, inter-planar interaction <b>energies,</b> and IGC <b>dispersive</b> surface <b>energy.</b> A number of materials showed significant deviations from general trends. Weak correlations and outliers were rationalised. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the highest d-spacing of a material could serve as a first-order indicator for ranking mechanical behaviour of pharmaceutical powders, but with some reservation. Inter-planar interaction energy normalised for surface area shows only a weak link with mechanical properties and does not appear to capture essential physics of deformation. A novel framework linking mechanical properties of crystals to the distinct quantities, slip-plane energy barrier and inter-planar interaction (detachment) energy is proposed...|$|R
