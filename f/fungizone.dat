Analysis by absorption and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that when these formulations containing AmB at concentrations of less than 10 (- 5) M were added to buffer, the AmB dissociated slowly as monomers from Egam or Edam and dissociated rapidly as a mixture of monomers and self-associated species from <b>Fungizone.</b> We propose that in Egam and Edam, the absence of free AmB in the self-associated form reduces the toxicity of AmB to mammalian cells, whereas the presence of monomeric AmB results in the retention of the antifungal activities of these complexes...|$|E
40|$|The {{amphotericin}} B lipid complex (ABLC), {{which is}} composed of amphotericin B and the phospholipids dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine and dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol, was evaluated for its acute toxicity in mice and for its efficacy in mice infected {{with a variety of}} fungal pathogens. ABLC was markedly less toxic to mice when it was administered intravenously; it had a 50 % lethal dose of greater than 40 mg/kg compared with a 50 % lethal dose of 3 mg/kg for <b>Fungizone,</b> the desoxycholate form of amphotericin B. ABLC was efficacious against systemic infections in mice caused by Candida albicans, Candida species other than C. albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum. ABLC was also efficacious in immunocompromised animals infected with C. albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and H. capsulatum. Against some infections, the efficacy of ABLC was comparable to that of <b>Fungizone,</b> while against other infections <b>Fungizone</b> was two- to fourfold more effective than ABLC.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of AmBisome, a liposomal formulation of amphotericin B, was {{compared with that}} of <b>Fungizone</b> (amphotericin B desoxycholate), in a rat model of unilateral, pulmonary aspergillosis. Repeated administration of cyclophosphamide resulted in persistent, severe granulocytopenia. The left lung was inoculated with a conidial suspension of Aspergillus fumigatus, thus establishing an unilateral infection. Antifungal treatment was started 40 h after fungal inoculation, at which time mycelial disease was confirmed by histological examination. Both <b>Fungizone</b> 1 mg/kg and AmBisome 10 mg/kg resulted in increased survival in terms of delayed as well as reduced mortality. Quantitative cultures of lung tissue showed that only AmBisome 10 mg/kg resulted in reduction of the number of fungal cfus in the inoculated left lung. Compared with <b>Fungizone,</b> both AmBisome 1 mg/kg/day and AmBisome 10 mg/kg/day significantly prevented dissemination from the infected left lung to the right lung. In addition, both AmBisome regimens reduced hepatosplenic dissemination, and the 10 m/kg dosage fully prevented this complication. In conclusion, when compared with <b>Fungizone,</b> in this model AmBisome is more effective in reducing dissemination of unilateral, pulmonary aspergillosis, even when given in relatively low dosage.

40|$|Amphotericin B (AmB), {{the drug}} of choice for the {{treatment}} of most systemic fungal infections, is marketed under the trademark <b>Fungizone,</b> as an AmB-deoxycholate complex suitable for intravenous administration. The association between AmB and deoxycholate is relatively weak; therefore, dissociation occurs in the blood. The drug itself interacts with both mammalian and fungal cell membranes to damage cells, but the greater susceptibility of fungal cells to its effects forms the basis for its clinical usefulness. The ability of the drug to form stable complexes with lipids has allowed the development of new formulations of AmB based on this property. Several lipid-based formulations of the drug which are more selective in damaging fungal or parasitic cells than mammalian cells and some of which also have a better therapeutic index than <b>Fungizone</b> have been developed. In vitro investigations have led {{to the conclusion that the}} increase in selectivity observed is due to the selective transfer of AmB from lipid complexes to fungal cells or to the higher thermodynamic stability of lipid formulations. Association with lipids modulates AmB binding to lipoproteins in vivo, thus influencing tissue distribution and toxicity. For example, lipid complexes of AmB can be internalized by macrophages, and the macrophages then serve as a reservoir for the drug. Furthermore, stable AmB-lipid complexes are much less toxic to the host than <b>Fungizone</b> and can therefore be administered in higher doses. Experimentally, the efficacy of AmB-lipid formulations compared with <b>Fungizone</b> depends on the animal model used. Improved therapeutic indices for AmB-lipid formations have been demonstrated in clinical trials, but the definitive trials leading to the selection of an optimal formulation and therapeutic regimen have not been done...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} free {{amphotericin}} B (as <b>Fungizone)</b> and amphotericin B (AMB) incorporated into liposomes on {{the proliferation of}} lymphocytes were determined. Freshly obtained guinea pig and rat antigen-specific lymphocytes were compared with rat T-lymphocyte cell lines cultured {{for a long period}} of time. Incorporation of AMB into multilayered vesicles significantly reduced its effect relative to that of <b>Fungizone</b> on cultured T-cell lines, as reported by others for mammalian cells. In contrast, the effects on freshly obtained antigen-specific lymphocytes were different. <b>Fungizone</b> inhibited proliferation of antigen-specific lymph node cells freshly obtained from immunized guinea pigs at fungicidal concentrations, and incorporation into multilayered lipid vesicles did not have much of a protective effect. Higher concentrations of <b>Fungizone</b> were required to inhibit proliferation of fresh rat lymph node cells, but incorporation into multilayered lipid vesicles still did not have much of a protective effect. Some T lymphocytes in the peripheral circulation of guinea pigs and in the lymph nodes of rats were more resistant to liposomal AMB than another more sensitive T-lymphocyte population was. Proliferation of lymphocytes in response to mitogens was inhibited less than that in response to specific antigen was. Thus, sensitivity to AMB depended on the species, the strength of the stimulus used to activate the lymphocytes, and on some other property of the lymphocytes, possibly their state of differentiation. Regardless of the reason for the difference in effects on freshly obtained lymph node lymphocytes and cultured line cells, the former may be more relevant to effects in vivo and should be considered in a complete evaluation of the in vivo toxicity of these forms of the drug. Incorporation into sonicated unilamellar vesicles had more of a protective effect, while equimolar drug-lipid complexes had even more of a protective effect. These forms of AMB might have less of an immunosuppressive potential than multilayered vesicles containing low amounts of AMB do...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetic}} {{profiles of}} a traditional formulation of amphotericin B (<b>Fungizone)</b> and novel nanosphere and mixed micelle delivery systems developed for amphotericin B were compared and described. Six groups of male Wistar rats received intravenous injections of the different formulations.

The amphotericin B concentrations in plasma and tissues were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The plasma drug concentration-time profiles were best described by a two-compartment model.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the biodistribution and toxicity of amphotericin B (AmB) following multiple oral administrations of a novel tropically stable lipid-based formulation (iCo- 010). Methods BALB/c mice were allocated into six groups: oral iCo- 010 twice daily for 5 days in the dose of 20, 10, 5 and 2. 5 mg/kg; vehicle control; and intravenous boluses of <b>Fungizone</b> ® 2 mg/kg once daily for 5 days. The animals were sacrificed 12 h following the last administration and blood and tissues were collected. Results The plasma concentrations of AmB were similar to previously reported after administration of iCo- 009. Somewhat lower concentrations of AmB were detected in reticulo-endothelial system in the case of iCo- 010 when compared with iCo- 009. The concentration in kidney was higher with iCo- 010 than with iCo- 009. The creatinine levels in all oral treatment groups were in a normal range as in the case of iCo- 009. Administration of <b>Fungizone</b> ® resulted in elevated plasma creatinine levels. Histopathology analysis detected no GI, liver or kidney toxicity following multiple dose oral administration of iCo- 010. <b>Fungizone</b> ® treatment induced necrotic changes in hepatic and kidney tissues.

Prophylactic efficacy was based on survival and fungal burden in the target organ (kidneys or spleen). At 9 to 10 days after histoplasma challenge, 80 to 90 % of both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed mice in the control and <b>Fungizone</b> groups had died. All AmBisome-treated mice survived, although in the AmBisome groups given 1 mg/kg, the mice became moribund by day 10 to 12. No spleen CFU were detected in the histoplasma-challenged mice given 10 or 20 mg of AmBisome per kg. By 23 to 24 days after histoplasma challenge, fungal growth and/or death had occurred in all immunosuppressed mice except for four mice receiving 20 mg of AmBisome per kg.

40|$|In {{common with}} a {{proportion}} of patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), the efficacy of AmBisome treatment regimens in our rat model remains suboptimal. To investigate whether {{this might be the}} result of initially low antifungal activity of amphotericin B at the site of infection when administered in the liposomal form, <b>Fungizone</b> was added to AmBisome at the start of treatment. Groups of granulocytopenic rats with left-sided IPA received 10 day treatment regimens with either AmBisome 10 mg/kg/day (n = 25) or AmBisome 10 mg/kg/day combined with a single dose of <b>Fungizone</b> 1 mg/kg at day 1 (n = 27). Parameters of treatment response included survival, serum galactomannan (GM), size and quality of pulmonary macroscopic lesions, lung weight, viable fungal counts (cfu) and chitin content of the infected lung, and extra-pulmonary disseminated fungal infection. In a separate experiment the significance of early start of treatment to obtain therapeutic efficacy was investigated. Compared with untreated controls, both treatment regimens showed a significant increase in survival and change in parameters of fungal infection except left lung cfu. The combination treatment showed a significant increase in survival compared with AmBisome monotherapy (P = 0. 02) and a significant decrease in left lung chitin content (P = 0. 03). Differences in circulating GM concentrations between the two treatment regimes approached significance (P = 0. 06). Delay in the start of treatment from 16 to 24 h after fungal inoculation resulted in a significant decrease in therapeutic efficacy (P = 0. 02). It is concluded that the efficacy of AmBisome therapy can be enhanced by the addition of <b>Fungizone</b> at the start of treatment.

40|$|Direct {{amphotericin}} B-mediated tubular toxicity: Assessments {{of selected}} cytoprotective agents. Amphotericin B (AB) may induce {{acute renal failure}} by vasoconstrictive and tubulo-toxic effects. Although mannitol, Ca 2 + channel blockers, and lipid-based AB preparations have been suggested to mitigate in vivo AB nephrotoxicity, whether they confer direct tubular cytoprotection has not been defined. Therefore, this study assessed the impact of mannitol, verapamil/extracellular Ca 2 +, and cholesteryl sulfate (CS) AB binding on AB cytotoxicity, employing an isolated rat proximal tubular segment (PTS) preparation. After 30 to 60 minutes of incubation, 0. 2 mg/ml of AB (<b>Fungizone)</b> caused marked toxicity, as assessed by LDH release (29 to 44 %) and ATP depletion (> 90 %). Approximately 40 % of the LDH release {{could be attributed to}} deoxycholate, the standard AB (<b>Fungizone)</b> solubilizing agent. Both 100 mM mannitol and 100 mM glucose decreased AB-mediated LDH release, despite having a quantitatively trivial impact on ATP concentrations (increments of <= 1 % at normal values). Dimethylthiourea (25 mM; equipotent to 100 mM mannitol/glucose as a hydroxyl radical scavenger) did not decrease LDH release. Neither verapamil addition (100 µM) nor Ca 2 + removal from the PTS buffer had a protective effect. CS binding completely eliminated AB's toxicity (no LDH or ATP losses). The effect of AB and CS-AB on concomitant O 2 deprivation/reoxygenation (30 min/ 15 min) PTS injury was also assessed. AB and hypoxia/reoxygenation caused additive, not synergistic, LDH release whereas CS-AB had no adverse effect. We conclude that: (1) AB (<b>Fungizone)</b> is directly toxic to PTS, due, in part, to an independent deoxycholate effect; (2) mannitol blunts AB cytotoxicity, presumably via an osmotic, not anti-oxidant or ATP enhancing effect; (3) extracellular Ca 2 + does not mediate AB PTS toxicity and thus, verapamil confers no protection; (4) AB and O 2 deprivation cause additive, not synergistic, PTS injury; and (5) CS binding completely blocks AB's direct tubulo-toxic effects...|$|E
30|$|Each {{cell line}} was cultured in the {{appropriate}} medium with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Qualified FBS, US approved), 50  U mL− 1 Penicillin and 50  U mL− 1 Streptomycin at 37 °C. The DC 2.4 {{cells were cultured in}} RPMI medium, the HeLa tumor cells in DMEM medium with 1 % Amphotericin B (<b>Fungizone),</b> and the 3 T 3 fibroblast cells in DMEM, High Glucose Glutamax with 10  mM HEPES. Each line was passaged with 0.05 % Trypsin–EDTA every 3 – 4  days for regular maintenance.|$|E
40|$|The lipid {{formulation}} of amphotericin B, Amphotec (ABCD), {{has not been}} used intrathecally. After a single intrathecal dose or after four doses, conventionally formulated deoxycholate amphotericin B (AMB) (<b>Fungizone)</b> resulted in higher levels of amphotericin B in the cerebrospinal fluid of rabbits than did ABCD. Clinically and histologically, ABCD was about threefold less toxic than AMB after a single dose and 3 - to 30 -fold less toxic after multiple dosing. These data are encouraging for the potential use of ABCD as an intrathecal treatment...|$|E
40|$|Amphotericin B (AmB) {{is a very}} {{effective}} antifungal agent for most systemic fungal infections. However, the relatively high toxicity of this drug imposes limits on its clinical usefulness. Most of the current work in this field {{is devoted to the}} search for less-toxic formulations of the drug. Here we describe the effects of three surfactants, one anionic and the other two nonionic, on the aggregation state of AmB in solutions which were injected intravenously into mice. The degree of aggregation of AmB was monitored spectroscopically and by light scattering. The toxicity was expressed as percentage of survivors. These results were compared with those obtained with doses of AmB the same as those present in a commercial formulation of AmB, <b>Fungizone.</b> Two surfactants, lauryl sucrose and sodium deoxycholate, used at concentrations which induced monomerization of AmB, substantially decreased the acute toxicity of AmB to mice. Conversely, the third surfactant, Tween 80, showed a synergistic potentiation of the toxicity of the antibiotic. A good correlation was found between the in vivo toxicity and the aggregation state of AmB in injected solutions. Solutions in which AmB was almost entirely monomeric were half as toxic after 24 h and about six times less toxic after 1 week than the corresponding solutions of <b>Fungizone...</b>|$|E
30|$|The target cells {{used in this}} {{experiment}} were a continuous line of mouse fibroblast L 929 cells (NCTC clone 929; American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, VA, USA; ECACC No. 2869501)). The cells were maintained at 37  °C under 5 % CO 2 and 100 % humidity in DMEM and supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and antibiotics (200  μl/ml penicillin G, 200  μg/ml streptomycin, and 2  μg/ml <b>fungizone).</b> The medium was changed every other day. When the cells reached confluence, they were detached using 0.2 % (w/v) trypsin and transferred to new culture flasks.|$|E

When the first of five daily doses of AmBisome was combined with a single low dose of <b>Fungizone</b> (0. 1 mg of AMB/kg), the efficacy was equal to that of PEG-AMB-LIP...|$|E
