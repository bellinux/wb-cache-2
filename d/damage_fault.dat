40|$|Many {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} to answer two questions on aging: "Why do we age?" and "How do we age?" Among them, evolutionary theories are proposed to interpret the evolutionary advantage of aging, and "saving resources for group benefit" {{is thought to be}} the purpose of aging. However for saving resources, a more economic strategy should be to make a rapid death to the individuals who are over the reproduction age rather than to make them aging. Biological theories are proposed to identify the causes and the biological processes of aging. However, some theories including cell senescence/telomere theory, gene-controlling theory, and developmental theory, have unfortunately ignored the influence of damage on aging. Free-radical theory suggests that free radicals by causing intrinsic damage are the main cause of aging. However, even if intracellular free radicals cause injuries, they could be only associated with some but not all of the aging changes. <b>Damage</b> (<b>fault)</b> -accumulation theory predicts that faults as intrinsic damage can accumulate and lead to aging. However, in fact an unrepaired fault could not possibly remain in a living organism, since it can destroy the integrity of tissue structure and cause rapid failure of the organism. These traditional theories are all incomplete on interpreting aging phenomena. Nevertheless, developmental theory and <b>damage</b> (<b>fault)</b> -accumulation theory are more useful, because they have recognized the importance of damage and development process in aging. Some physical theories are useful, because they point out the common characteristics of aging changes, including loss of complexity, consequence of increase of entropy, and failure of information-transmission.

40|$|Dynamic rupture {{simulations}} {{are unique}} in {{their contributions to}} the study of earthquake physics. The current rapid development of dynamic rupture simulations poses several new questions: Do the simulations reflect the real world? Do the simulations have predictive power? Which one should we believe when the simulations disagree? This thesis illustrates how integration with observations can help address these questions and reduce the effects of non-uniqueness of both dynamic rupture simulations and kinematic inversion problems. Dynamic rupture simulations with observational constraints can effectively identify non-physical features inferred from observations. Moreover, the integrative technique can also provide more physical insights into the mechanisms of earthquakes. This thesis demonstrates two examples of such kinds of integration: dynamic rupture simulations of the M w 9. 0 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake and of earthquake ruptures in <b>damaged</b> <b>fault</b> zones: (1) We develop simulations of the Tohoku-Oki earthquake based on a variety of observations and minimum assumptions of model parameters. The simulations provide realistic estimations of stress drop and fracture energy of the region and explain the physical mechanisms of high-frequency radiation in the deep region. We also find that the overridding subduction wedge contributes significantly to the up-dip rupture propagation and large final slip in the shallow region. Such findings are also applicable to other megathrust earthquakes. (2) <b>Damaged</b> <b>fault</b> zones are usually found around natural faults, but their effects on earthquake ruptures have been largely unknown. We simulate earthquake ruptures in <b>damaged</b> <b>fault</b> zones with material properties constrained by seismic and geological observations. We show that reflected waves in fault zones are effective at generating pulse-like ruptures and head waves tend to accelerate and decelerate rupture speeds. These mechanisms are robust in natural fault zones with large attenuation and off-fault plasticity. Moreover, earthquakes in <b>damaged</b> <b>fault</b> zones can propagate at super-Rayleigh speeds that are unstable in homogeneous media. Supershear transitions in fault zones do not require large fault stresses. In the end, we present observations in the Big Bear region, where variability of rupture speeds of small earthquakes correlates with the laterally variable materials in a <b>damaged</b> <b>fault</b> zone. ...|$|R

Here we use both fully dynamic rupture simulations and high-resolution seismic observations to show that supershear earthquakes can be induced by <b>damaged</b> <b>fault</b> zones, the low-velocity layers of damaged rocks that typically exist around major faults and serve as waveguides for high-frequency energy.

"Aging {{as a result of}} accumulation of 'faults' on cellular and molecular levels", has been proposed in the <b>damage</b> (<b>fault)</b> -accumulation theory. However, this theory fails to explain some aging phenotypes such as fibrosis and premature aging, since terms such as 'damage' and 'fault' are not specified. Therefore we introduce some crucial modifications of this theory and arrive at a novel theory: aging of the body is the result of accumulation of Misrepair of tissue. It emphasizes: a) it is Misrepair, not the original damage, that accumulates and leads to aging; and b) aging can occur at different levels, however aging of the body takes place necessarily on the tissue level, but not requiring the aging of cells/molecules. The Misrepair-accumulation theory introduced in the present paper unifies the understanding of the roles of environmental damage, repair, gene regulation, and multicellular structure in the aging process. This theory gives explanations for the aging phenotypes, premature aging, the difference of longevity in different species, and it is consistent with the physical view on complex systems...|$|E

Velocity variations from the active and passive methods are quite consistent, which both are characterized by ± 0. 2 % seasonal variation, with peak and trough at winter and summer, respectively. The peri-odic velocity variation within fault zone exhibits remark-ably positive correlation with barometric pressure with stress sensitivity in the order of 10 - 6 Pa- 1, suggesting that the plausible mechanism might be the crack density vari-ation of the shallow subsurface medium of the <b>damaged</b> <b>fault</b> zone in response to the cyclic barometric pressure loading...|$|R

Our approach reproduces {{all stages of}} earthquake cycles: nucleation and propagation of earthquake rupture, postseismic slip and interseismic creep. We apply the developed methodology to {{study the effects of}} low-rigidity layers on the dynamics of the earthquake cycle in 2 -D. We consider two cases: small (M ~ 1) earthquakes on a fault surrounded by a <b>damaged</b> <b>fault</b> zone and large (M ~ 7) earthquakes on a vertical strike-slip fault that cuts through shallow low-rigidity layers. Our results indicate how the source properties of repeating earthquakes are affected by the presence of a <b>damaged</b> <b>fault</b> zone with low rigidity. Compared to faults in homogeneous media, we find (1) reduction in the earthquake nucleation size, (2) amplification of slip rates during dynamic rupture propagation, (3) larger recurrence interval, and (4) smaller amount of aseismic slip. Based on linear stability analysis, we derive a theoretical estimate of the nucleation size {{as a function of the}} width and rigidity reduction of the fault zone layer, which is in good agreement with simulated nucleation sizes. We further examine the effects of vertically-stratified layers (e. g., sedimentary basins) on the nature of shallow coseismic slip deficit. Our results suggest that low-rigidity shallow layers alone do not lead to coseismic slip deficit. While the low-rigidity layers result in lower interseismic stress accumulation, they also cause dynamic amplification of slip rates, with the net effect on slip being nearly zero...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEarthquake slip {{distributions}} are asymmetric along strike, but {{the reasons}} for the asymmetry are unknown. We address this question by establishing empirical relations between earthquake slip profiles and fault properties. We analyze the slip distributions of 27 large continental earthquakes in the context of available information on their causative faults, in particular on the directions of their long-term lengthening. We find that the largest slips during each earthquake systematically occurred on that half of the ruptured fault sections most distant from the long-term fault propagating tips, i. e., on the most mature half of the broken fault sections. Meanwhile, slip decreased linearly over most of the rupture length in the direction of long-term fault propagation, i. e., of decreasing structural maturity along strike. We suggest that this earthquake slip asymmetry is governed by along-strike changes in fault properties, including fault zone compliance and fault strength, induced by the evolution of off-fault <b>damage,</b> <b>fault</b> segmentation, and fault planarity with increasing structural maturity. We also find higher rupture speeds in more mature rupture sections, consistent with predicted effects of low-velocity damage zones on rupture dynamics. Since the direction(s) of long-term fault propagation can be determined from geological evidence, {{it might be possible to}} anticipate in which direction earthquake slip, once nucleated, may increase, accelerate, and possibly lead to a large earthquake. Our results could thus contribute to earthquake hazard assessment and Earthquake Early Warning...|$|E

In order to investigate the deformation processes responsible for earthquake nucleation we have studied ancient and exhumed Evaporites bearing normal faults cropping out in Tuscany. Within the TE formation, that is a 2. 5 km thick sequence, composed of decimetric-to-decameter scale interbeds of foliated gypsumanhydrites and brecciated dolostones, we have studied fault zone architecture and deformation processes of both small (100 m) displacement faults. Small and large scale faults display a relatively well structured internal architecture with a sharp reduction in grain-size between the damage zone (coarse grained protocatclasite) and the fault core (fine/very fine grained cataclasite). Extreme localization of slip to discrete and very thin (Y and B shear up to 10 - 100 mm) sliding surfaces is observed within the fine-grained dolomitic bearing cataclasite layers within the fault core. Fluid assisted processes have been inferred by fault fracture mesh development with crack and seal textures within dolomite-dominated <b>damage</b> <b>fault</b> zone.

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} {{indicate}} that ambient noise and seismic signals in fault zones tend to be polarized on the horizontal plane with a clear preferred orientation direction. Here we present a summary of past experiments {{as well as new}} study cases showing evidence of this effect: the Val d’Agri, the Pernicana and the Paganica faults in Italy, and the Hayward fault in California. We also analyze data recorded by the HRSN network at the Parkfield section of the San Andreas fault and find that stations MM and GH that are close to the fault damage zone show a similar persistent and marked polarization effect. The approach combines the H/V technique in the frequency domain with the covariance matrix diagonalization method in the time domain. Common features are: i) a high stability of results at each site, independently of the nature and location of the source of seismic signals, ii) a characteristic polarization for each fault, and iii) the preferred polarization is close to the fault-normal direction, rather than being fault parallel as would be expected for generation of fault zone trapped waves. In previous papers, the role of fluid-filled microcracks in the damage zone was hypothesized. We have then explored an hypothesis based on the fracture field orientation in the fault damage zone by applying the package FRAP 3 (Salvini, 2002) to model the brittle deformation field expected for the studied faults. We have found a consistent orthogonal relation between the observed polarizations and the orientation of the predicted synthetic fracture systems. When anisotropy studies are available, the horizontal ground motion polarization is consistently found to be perpendicular to the fast wave splitting component.

The unstable sector is bounded to the North by a E-W transtensive fault (the Pernicana fault system), extending from the NE Rift to the coastline of the Ionian Sea for a length of > 18 km. The western portion of the Pernicana fault system (close to Piano Pernicana area) {{is characterized}} by the most intense deformation. In this area we have performed volcanic tremor measurements on a dense grid along and across the fault zone. Ambient vibration measurements are also performed along a second fault (Tremestieri fault) which confines the slip of the eastern flank to the south-east. The analysis using both microtremors and local earthquakes recorded in these faults shows persistent polarization of ground motion. Horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios (HVSR) show large directional resonances of horizontal components within the <b>damaged</b> <b>fault</b> zones. The resonance occurs around 1 Hz at Piano Pernicana, and around 4 Hz in the Tremestieri fault zone. The resonance amplitude in the HVSRs seems to be fairly well correlated to soil gas anomalous concentrations (in particular, radon and CO 2 both considered tracer gases of major crustal discontinuity) in the two fault zones, suggesting that both the effects are linked to local fracturing conditions. According to previous results on velocity anisotropy in the shallow crust, we believe that a role on polarization could be played by stress-induced anisotropy and micro-fracture orientation in the near-surface lavas.

In this present contribution, we document the role exerted by fractures on ﬂuid ﬂow in carbonate damage zones of hydrocarbon-bearing, km-long, oblique-slip normal faults with 10 's of m-throw. The carbonate <b>fault</b> <b>damage</b> zones were analysed by mean of scan line surveys conducted in both tar-free and tar-rich outcrops. In this way, the relationships among the individ ual fracture characteristics (length, spacing, aperture, orientation, connectivity and distance from slip surfaces pertaining to small faults of the <b>fault</b> <b>damage</b> zones) and hydrocarbons have been established. Data obtained by scan line surveys were also used to compute the amount of fracture porosity, the degree of fracture connectivity and, based upon simple assumptions, the orientation of the local σhmax at times of faulting. Additionally, scan line surveys were also carried out along outcrops exposing unfaulted carbonate host rocks. The results of our computation are consistent with a carbonate host rock made up of a quite isotropic fracture array comprised of isolated and coupled fractures, in which individual fracture sets have negative exponential spacing distributions. In terms of ﬂuid ﬂ ow, the fracture array of the carbonate host rock enhances the ﬂuid storage. Conversely, the fracture array of the <b>fault</b> <b>damage</b> zones is characterized by a pronounced anisotropy due to interconnected fractures, which enhance the ﬂuid migration. Fractures in the <b>fault</b> <b>damage</b> zones include those inherited from background deformation and others related to the faulting processes. The latter fracture sets are characterized by power law spacing distributions.

30|$|Relays {{are vital}} devices present in any power system. They protect various {{components}} in the power system from catastrophic <b>damage</b> during <b>faults.</b> They help in maintaining {{safe and reliable operation}} of the entire system. A recent study analyzing protection system misoperations was performed by North Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and they identified various causes for relay misoperations [1]. All these emphasize the need to make comprehensive assessment of relay operation and its performance regularly.|$|R
40|$|Structurally controlled, syn-rift, clastic depocentres are of {{economic}} interest as hydrocarbon reservoirs; understanding {{the structure of}} their bounding faults is of great relevance, e. g. {{in the assessment of}} fault-controlled hydrocarbon retention potential. Here we investigate the structure of the Dombjerg Fault Zone (Wollaston Forland, NE Greenland), a syn-rift border fault that juxtaposes syn-rift deep-water hanging-wall clastics against a footwall of crystalline basement. A series of discrete fault strands characterize the central fault zone, where discrete slip surfaces, fault rock assemblages and extreme fracturing are common. A chemical alteration zone (CAZ) of fault-related calcite cementation envelops the fault and places strong controls on the style of deformation, particularly in the hanging-wall. The hanging-wall <b>damage</b> zone includes <b>faults,</b> joints, veins and, outside the CAZ, disaggregation deformation bands. Footwall deformation includes faults, joints and veins. Our observations suggest that the CAZ formed during early-stage fault slip and imparted a mechanical control on later fault-related deformation. This study thus gives new insights to the structure of an exposed basin-bounding fault and highlights a spatiotemporal interplay between <b>fault</b> <b>damage</b> and chemical alteration, the latter of which is often underreported in fault studies. To better elucidate the structure, evolution and flow properties of faults (outcrop or subsurface), both <b>fault</b> <b>damage</b> and fault-related chemical alteration must be considered. Highlights • Faults juxtaposing syn-rift clastics against crystalline basement are investigated. • Early fault-zone diagenesis profoundly influences later fault-related deformation. • Spatiotemporal interplay between <b>fault</b> <b>damage</b> and chemical alteration. • Findings have implications for fault-bounded syn-rift reservoirs in the subsurface...|$|R

This causes metering CTs to saturate at lower secondary voltages saving sensitive connected metering devices from <b>damaging</b> large <b>fault</b> currents {{in the event of}} a primary electrical fault. A CT with a rating of 0.3B0.6 would indicate with up to 0.6 ohms of secondary burden the secondary current will be within a 0.3 percent error parallelogram on an accuracy diagram incorporating both phase angle and ratio errors.|$|R
