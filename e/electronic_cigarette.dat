40|$|Background: Awareness and {{usage of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> has {{exponentially}} increased {{during the last}} few years. The rapid acceptance of <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> may be attributed in part to the perception created by marketing and the popular press that they are safer than combustible cigarettes. Goals: To alert and advise policy makers about <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> and their potential hazards. Methods: Using the Union's position paper on <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> as the starting template, the document was written using an iterative process. Portions of the manuscript have been taken directly from the position papers of participating societies. Results: Since <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> generate less tar and carcinogens than combustible <b>cigarettes,</b> use <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> may reduce disease caused by those components. However, the health risks of <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> have not been adequately studied. Studies looking at whether <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> can aid smoking cessation have had inconsistent results. Moreover, the availability of <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> may have an overall adverse health impact by increasing initiation and reducing cessation of combustible nicotine delivery products. Conclusions: The health and safety claims regarding electronic nicotine delivery devices should be subject to evidentiary review. The potential benefits of <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> to an individual smoker should be weighed against potential harm to the population of increased social acceptability of smoking and use of nicotine, the latter of which has addictive power and untoward effects. As a precaution, electronic nicotine delivery devices should be restricted or banned until more information about their safety is available. If they are allowed, they should be closely regulated as medicines or tobacco product...|$|R

40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> pose a {{competitive}} {{threat to the}} makers of cigarettes and other tobacco products, {{as well as to}} nicotine replacement therapies such as nicotine gum and patches. A common response to such a threat is support for government regulation to suppress competition. Predictably, cigarette manufacturers and other threatened producers, as well as the governments that earn revenue from tobacco taxes, are supporting greater regulation of <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> that would replicate the cartel-supporting rules of the Master Settlement Agreement.

40|$|Background: The use of <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> has {{dramatically}} {{increased over the}} past decade, mostly answering the public health issues that arose due to tobacco smoking, including prevention of cancer, addiction, abuse and indoor air quality. ^ Objectives: This review {{is based on the}} current available literature and focuses on the importance of <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> and its effect on indoor air quality. This systematic review affirms that <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> cause deterioration in indoor air quality. They produce fewer pollutants and lower concentrations compared to conventional tobacco cigarettes. ^ Methods: A systematic review was conducted to consolidate the excessive amount of available data to logically perceivable bite size information related to <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> and indoor air quality. Results: When compared to conventional tobacco cigarettes, but higher compared to control or background emissions, thus still causing secondhand and third-hand exposures causing deterioration in indoor air quality. ^ Conclusion: The studies have shown that indoor air pollutants like nicotine, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter (PM 1, PM 2. 5, and PM 10) and trace metals are present in the emissions from <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> More research on <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> and their impacts on indoor air quality should be conducted using standardized procedures, preserving consistency and enhancing inferential quality. ...|$|R

40|$|While {{the adverse}} effects of conventional {{cigarettes}} on human health have been thoroughly examined, in the last 15 years we have witnessed the birth of electronic cigarettes. There are many types of these devices available on the market. Studies are still underway to determine their {{negative impact on the}} human body. <b>Electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> comprise of power supply and a vaporising system. The user inhales the aerosol produced by heating up the liquid containing nicotine. In contrast with conventional cigarettes, the tobacco is not combusted, thus the compositions of the aerosol and cigarette smoke are considerably different. Out of  93 chemical substances present in the e-cigarette smoke, the aerosol contains only acetaldehyde, acetone, acrolein, formaldehyde and nicotine. More toxic substances, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals, are not present. The amount of evidence suggesting electronic cigarettes’ harmful effects on the human body is constantly increasing. Some reports imply that the <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> negatively influence pregnancy, human psyche, respiratory and cardiovascular systems. They might also be involved in oncogenesis. With <b>electronic</b> <b>cigarettes</b> constantly gaining popularity, the question about {{the adverse effects}} of passive smoking becomes increasingly more relevant.
