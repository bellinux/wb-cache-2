"No {{suspicion}} {{of the truth}} ever occurred to him, and the doctor helped us out with our deception; yet his pulse, which day by day had been getting stronger, now beat feebler every hour. In {{that part of the}} country where I was born and grew up, the folks say that wherever the dead lie, there round about them, whether the time be summer or winter, the air grows cold and colder, and that no fire, though you pile the logs half-way up the chimney, will ever make it warm. A few months' hospital training generally cures one of all fanciful notions about death, but this idea I {{have never been able to}} get rid of. My thermometer may show me sixty, and I may try to believe that the temperature is sixty, but if the dead are beside me I feel cold to the marrow of my bones. I could see the chill from the <b>dead</b> <b>room</b> crawling underneath the door, and creeping up about his bed, and reaching out its hand to touch his heart.|$|E
6000|$|As {{they left}} the shop, went {{over a couple of}} blocks for the Winklehurst trolley, and boarded it, Carl did some swift thinking. He was not above flirting or, if the {{opportunity}} offered, carrying the flirtation to the most delicious, exciting, uncertain lengths he could. Here, with [...] "dinner in their own house," [...] with a girl interesting yet unknown, there was a feeling of sudden intimacy which might mean anything. Only--when their joined eyes had pledged mischief while she telephoned, she had been so quiet, so frank, so evidently free from a shamefaced erotic curiosity, that now he instantly dismissed the query, [...] "How far could I go? What does she expect?" [...] which, outside of pure-minded romances, really does come to men. It was a wonderful relief to dismiss the query; a simplification to live in the joy each moment gave of itself. The hour was like a poem. Yet he was no extraordinary person; he had, in the lonely hours of a <b>dead</b> <b>room,</b> been tortured with the unmoral longings which, good or bad, men do feel.|$|E

40|$|By {{means of}} virtual {{acoustics}} technologies the impulse response in a {{location of a}} real enclosure {{can be used to}} create a virtual room. Also in this virtual space, typically implemented in a <b>dead</b> <b>room,</b> an impulse response can be measured. From both ‘‘real’’ and respective ‘‘virtual’’ impulse response a group of room-acoustical parameters can be calculated. The match of the two groups of indicators mostly depends on the layout of the playback system and on the implemented processing. In this paper a procedure of virtual measurement in a <b>dead</b> <b>room</b> is developed and some typical layouts of playback systems employing two loudspeakers are compared. Based on the consistency of the room-acoustical indicators derived from ‘‘real’’ and ‘‘virtual’’ impulse responses can be investigated. It is shown how the performance depends on the angular separation of loudspeakers and the efficiency of the cross-talk is also tested and discussed. Finally, a set-up which is suitable for psychoacoustics tests is indicated...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIntensity {{measurement}} {{is generally}} {{used as a}} reference method, as it is more accurate then measuring sound pressure levels. However, the conventional two- microphone method only provides good accuracy in acoustically <b>dead</b> <b>room.</b> In this paper, a novel method employing an accelerometer and a microphone was used {{in order to obtain}} sound intensity close to a wall in reactive field. The tests were done in a reverberant room, whose conditions are not ideal for normal intensity method because {{the difference between the two}} microphone signals is swamped by the reverberant component, which gives a large, in-phase sound pressure. Two different intensity methods were used: the conventional two-microphone method and the microphone-accelerometer method. Firstly, the validation method was tested in a semi anechoic room. Subsequently, the same measurement was repeated in a reverberation room with absorption covering one wall and, finally, the same set up was tested in a reverberation room with no absorption whatsoever. There were found good results in low frequencies in all tests but especially in a reverberant room, which showed differences of around 2 to 4 dB between the two methods...|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of opera house acoustics, the term ‘‘balance’’ refers to the acoustical competition between the singer {{on the stage and}} the orchestra in the pit. The mechanism allowing the operatic singers {{to be heard over the}} orchestra has to do with their skill in enhancing the vocal emission by a peculiar use of the formant frequencies. This vital factor is sensed by the listeners and, apart from the obvious sound power ratio of the stage and the pit sources, is the main cue that helps to formulate a subjective impression of the balance. To achieve its objective qualification, two calibrated sound sources can be placed on the stage and in the pit, respectively, and their sound level difference is measured at the listeners’ seats. The scope of this work is to investigate the relationship between the subjective impression and the objective indicator of the balance and to develop a scale value for the parameter in the case of a historical opera house. For this scope a set of acoustical data from the Teatro Comunale in Ferrara will be used to create synthetic sound fields with controlled conditions of the balance between the stage and the pit. This methodology employs an anechoic piece for soprano ~with piano accompaniment! and is implemented in a <b>dead</b> <b>room</b> equipped with an acoustical rendering system. The sound fields are used to investigate the appropriate balance values by means of listening tests. The results of the scaling exercise show that a suitable range of values can be extracted and that the sound from the stage and the pit is perceived as balanced when the loudness difference between the two is comprised within 22. 0 dBA and 12. 3 dBA...|$|E
40|$|Poetry, Texas is a lyrical work {{in which}} an {{ensemble}} of voices, snatches of actuality and compelling narration is woven into a meditation on a fading {{way of life and}} beauty within the ordinary. It 2 ̆ 7 s a piece in which style and substance figure as enamoured equals engaged in a delightful dance. Malinovski 2 ̆ 7 s journey {{into the heart of the}} Texan town of Poetry is the central narrative frame of this work. An ensemble cast of fourteen characters including a cowboy called Rooster, Don Strictland, the undeclared mayor of Poetry, schoolchildren, various religious leaders and the local historian gives voice to the community. The sonic frame of Poetry, Texas articulates two distinct aural planes that both extend and enhance the thematic dynamic he develops between the literal and literary meaning of 2 ̆ 7 poetry’. Malinovski’s physical journey and the town community are both represented by earthy unrehearsed location recordings. The recordings position the listener as an observer rather than the one spoken to. The material feels experiential and ‘of the moment’; it is steeped in a diegetic sense of a lived environment and continuous timeframe. In contrast, Malinovski’s narration is controlled, scripted and recorded in a <b>dead</b> <b>room</b> with a warm, close microphone. A strong reliance on this form of authorial first-person narration can easily become heavy-handed and narratively swamp and overpower other voices and sounds. Of course the mitigating quality here is the poetic inclination of Malinovski 2 ̆ 7 s narration – the degree to which his thoughts, ideas and arguments provide a permeable and playful series of observations, connections and resonant sound-word ideas for listeners to engage with. Like a flip card with a picture of a bird on one side and a cage on the other that is animated through movement, Malinovski manages to capture and express something about Poetry that is intangible, provocative, playful and beautiful with a delightfully light touch.
