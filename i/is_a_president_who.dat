60|$|Gentlemen, as {{it seems}} to me, there are three great {{requisites}} essential to the perfect realisation of a scene so unusual and so splendid as that in which we are now assembled. The first, and I must say very difficult requisite, is a man possessing the stronghold in the general remembrance, the indisputable claim on the general regard and esteem, which is possessed by my dear and much valued friend our guest. The second requisite is the presence of a body of entertainers,--a great multitude of hosts so cheerful and good-humoured (under, I am sorry to say, some personal inconvenience),--so warm-hearted and so nobly in earnest, as those whom I have the privilege of addressing. The third, and certainly not the least of these requisites, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>president</b> <b>who,</b> less by his social position, which he may claim by inheritance, or by fortune, which may have been adventitiously won, and may be again accidentally lost, than by his comprehensive genius, shall fitly represent the best part of him to whom honour is done, and the best part of those who unite in the doing of it. Such a president I think we have found in our chairman of to-night, and I need scarcely add that our chairman's health is the toast I have to propose to you.|$|E

50|$|Section 3 {{provides}} {{that if the}} president-elect dies before Inauguration Day, the vice president-elect will be sworn in as president on that day.

Section 3 also allows Congress to determine who should be acting president if a new {{president and vice president}} have not been chosen by Inauguration Day. The Constitution was originally silent on this point, an omission that nearly caused a constitutional crisis when Congress seemed deadlocked in resolving the election of 1800.|$|E

Historians who participated in a 2006 survey voted his failure to deal with secession the worst presidential mistake ever made.|$|R

50|$|Beyond the {{questions}} of confidentiality, privilege and privacy, the Court found that the Act does not interfere with President Nixon’s First Amendment rights of association. Further, the Court determined {{that the federal government}} had compelling reasons to preserve Nixon’s Presidential materials, and archival screening was the least restrictive way to review presidential materials and to return private papers to the president. Finally, the Act did not violate the Bill of Attainder clause of the Constitution because this Act does not convict former <b>President</b> Nixon of <b>a</b> crime and does not expose him to prosecution. The Court commented that Congress was justified in approving the Act because Congress believed Nixon <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>President</b> <b>who</b> could serve as an example for future presidents. The Court determined that the purpose of this Act was not to punish President Nixon, but simply to legislate a policy that had a purpose of preserving important historical artifacts and presidential records.|$|R
