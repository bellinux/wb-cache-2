5|$|The {{engine was}} mounted on two main support frames that were {{supported}} by two tubular struts. The frame structure was triangulated and <b>emanated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fuselage. The main frames were bolted onto the power plant in its top quarter. In turn, the frames were attached to the firewall by universal joints. The firewall itself was constructed from asbestos mesh with dural sheets on both sides. All conduits passing through had to be arranged so that no harmful gases could penetrate the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|This caused great consternation {{among the}} aristocracy, {{who insisted that}} long use in itself {{constituted}} licence. A compromise was eventually reached in 1290, whereby a liberty was considered legitimate {{as long as it}} could be shown to have been exercised since the coronation of Richard the Lionheart in 1189. Royal gains from the Quo warranto proceedings were insignificant; few liberties were returned to the King. Edward had nevertheless won a significant victory, in clearly establishing the principle that all liberties essentially <b>emanated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crown.|$|E
5|$|Walter (John Noble) has {{prepared}} himself to reveal to Peter (Joshua Jackson) the truththat {{he is from}} the parallel universewhen they are called to a case. Two teenagers were found dead, evidently killed by shapeshifter agents from the parallel universe. Exploring the nearby area, they find a third unformed shapeshifter which Walter takes to the lab to study. At the same time of the teenagers' death, they find a carrier signal in the local television. With biotechnology corporation Massive Dynamic's help, they determine that the signal <b>emanated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> parallel universe during a brief moment that the two universes were in sync, and that the next point of synchronization would occur the next afternoon. Recalling Thomas Jerome Newton's (Sebastian Roché) previous attempt to bring a building from the parallel universe into the prime, the Fringe team believes they must stop this next attempt.|$|E

25|$|At the Rubio {{division}} terminus {{was built}} a broad platform to span the Canyon {{which included the}} Rubio Pavilion, a 12-room hotel, with dining facilities and other amenities. The pavilion also consisted of power generating facilities {{with the use of}} gas engines and Pelton waterwheels. Water was made available from reservoirs built in the canyon’s streams, though water was not always plentiful year round. As part of the entertainment experience, Lowe had a series of stairways and bridges built over the streams and waterfalls that <b>emanated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> canyon. The eleven waterfalls were individually named and today exist as local historical landmarks.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} of the Roman Empire, {{historical}} sources show that there were many movements of people around Europe, both within and outside the Empire. Historic sources sometimes cite instances of genocide inflicted by the Romans upon rebellious provincial tribes. If this did in fact occur, it would have been limited given that modern populations show considerable genetic continuity in their respective regions. The process of 'Romanisation' appears to have been accomplished by the colonisation of provinces by a few Latin speaking administrators, military personnel, settled veterans, and private citizens (merchants, traders) who <b>emanated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Empire's various regions (and not merely from Roman Italy). They served as a nucleus for the acculturation of local notables.|$|E
25|$|Between 1707 and 1731, {{the center}} of {{activity}} shifted from the Main Crater {{to other parts of}} Volcano Island. The eruptions of 1707 and 1715 occurred in Binitiang Malaki crater (the cinder cone visible from Tagaytay City). Minor eruptions also <b>emanated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Binintiang Munti crater on the westernmost tip of the island in 1709 and 1729. A more violent event happened on September 24, 1716, when the whole southeastern portion of the crater (Calauit), opposite Mount Macolod, was blown out. The 1731 eruption off Pira-Piraso or eastern tip of the island created an island. No studies had been done to determine whether Napayon or Bubuin Island was formed in the eruption, or just a pumice raft.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{over its}} 45 years of {{existence}} {{it is estimated}} that some 3 million people had ridden the railway, many coming {{from all parts of the}} country and the world. In its own inimitable way, it was a Disneyland of the day. Lowe had two favorite days of the year, Independence Day and Christmas, during which he would mark special events of his lifetime. A publication which <b>emanated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Tavern daily was the Echo, a preprinted newspaper with a blank page that had the names and home states of the daily arrivals surprinted. The four-page tabloid had three pages of biographical information on the railroad and other announcements of daily events.|$|E

25|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} Handley Page {{developed}} a new fast short-range regional airliner, intended to replace the venerable Douglas DC-3, particularly in third-world countries. The design, originally known as the HPR-3 Herald, <b>emanated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> drawing office at Handley Page (Reading) Limited—the former Miles Aircraft factory site, which had developed an earlier airliner design, the Miles Marathon. The Herald was an extensive re-development of the original concept of the Marathon, notable for its high mounted wing. The HP Reading division succeeded in producing a modern design with excellent flight and performance characteristics. However, the company made a serious misjudgement which was, in the end, to cost the company dearly, and like some other classic British aircraft of the time, the Herald missed its chance.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Griffin had {{an ambitious}} but {{unsuccessful}} attempt at adapting the venerable board game Monopoly {{into a game}} show of the same name. His last game show was a wild game show called Ruckus, which <b>emanated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Resorts International Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City, which he owned at the time. Involving slapstick stunts and a somewhat truncated version of his old Reach for the Stars, the show initially aired locally in New York, {{with the intent of}} national syndication early the following year. The Amazing Johnathan left the show after 65 episodes because of a contract dispute and the show was scrapped before it was to be nationally syndicated. A national audience did get a look at it, via reruns that aired for a time on GSN.|$|E
25|$|Boutwell {{during the}} 1880s and 1890s practiced {{international}} and patent law from offices in Boston and Washington, D.C. His business included {{working for the}} United States and other national governments as counsel to several bilateral diplomatic commissions. In the first, running from 1880 to 1884, he represented the US in regard to claims involving France which mostly <b>emanated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Civil War. He next served as counsel for Haiti (1885), and then again for the US on a commission with Chile (1893–94), which addressed claims against both governments most of whose origins were in either the War of the Pacific or the Chilean Civil War of 1891. In 1881, Boutwell turned down the appointment of Secretary of the Treasury from President Chester A. Arthur. He served for a time as a legal representative for the Kingdom of Hawaii, whose acquisition by the US he opposed.|$|E

Wolfe retaliated as he froze Burke out of wrestling among all NWA channels. Burke {{consulted}} Jack Pfefer for help. The Alliance attempted {{to reconcile the}} couple and the final result was that one would sell out to the other. Burke actually volunteered to sell for $50,000 but was rebuffed. On January 26, 1953, Wolfe sold to Burke, who created the company Attractions, Inc. The deal was for $30,000, all alimony was waived and Wolfe was barred from participating for five years. The pledge lasted {{only a few months}} as Wolfe started promoting wrestling in Columbus, Ohio. Wolfe tempted many grapplers by offering 50 percent of the proceeds. Burke challenged him by offering 60 percent of the proceeds from her promotion but Wolfe settled on the figure of 75 percent.|$|E
25|$|In the Umm al-kitab, Azazel is {{the first}} {{emanation}} of the high king (original God) and loaned the power of creation from the true God. Therefore he claimed to be an independent God, besides the high king. After that, the high king made a new creation which exceeded the creatures of Azazel. After he remains refusing to confess {{to be just a}} creature, <b>emanated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> true God, he is banished into lower spheres. Every time he refuses again to accept the new creation Salman, he is banished again into lower regions, until he reaches the earth. The earth is according to the Umm al-kitab created out of the essence of Azazels creation, while humans and lifeforce originated from the heavenly realm. Since Azazel is banished into the material world, he seduces the humans, leads them into his realm and tries to keep human trapped in there. He resembles to the gnostic demiurge.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, native Iowan Henry A. Wallace went to Washington as Secretary of Agriculture {{and served}} as {{principal}} architect for the new farm program. Wallace, {{former editor of the}} Midwest's leading farm journal, Wallace's Farmer, believed that prosperity would return to the agricultural sector only if agricultural production was curtailed. Further, he believed that farmers would be monetarily compensated for withholding agricultural land from production. These two principles were incorporated into the Agricultural Adjustment Act passed in 1933. Iowa farmers experienced some recovery {{as a result of the}} legislation but like all Iowans, they did not experience total recovery until the 1940s. Iowa's only Nobel Peace Prize Winner, Norman Borlaug, was launched in his researches in plant genomics by funding and research through Iowa State University developing strains of rice in Mexico and which <b>emanated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> work of Henry Wallace. Wallace and Borlaug's work helped create the now internationally significant agricultural concern Pioneer Hi-Bred, now a division of DuPont.|$|E

25|$|A Viking attempt against Mercia {{the same}} season failed, and in 869 their efforts against Wessex were fruitless {{in the face}} of {{opposition}} from Kings Ethelred and Alfred the Great. The archbishop, Wulfhere, seems to have temporised and collaborated with the Norse, for he was expelled from York when a Northumbrian uprising in 872 was only temporarily successful; he was recalled and held his seat until his death. The Viking king Guthred was buried in York Minster, a signal that he and the archbishop had reached a lasting accommodation. All the Viking coinage appears to have <b>emanated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mint at York, a mark of the city's unique status in Northumbria as an economic magnet. York's importance as the seat of Northumbria was confirmed when the Scandinavian warlord, Guthrum, headed for East Anglia, while Halfdan Ragnarsson seized power in AD 875. While the Danish army was busy in Britain, the Isle of Man and Ireland, the Swedish army was occupied with defending the Danish and Swedish homelands where Halfdan's brothers were in control.|$|E
