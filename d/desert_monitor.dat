40|$|ABSTRACT] The {{advancement}} of space informatic technology in India since 1980 s {{in general and}} establishment of Regional Remote Sensing Research Centres of Department of Space in particular have already had a significant contribution on <b>desert</b> <b>monitoring</b> and natural resource management in Indian Arid Region. The communication revolution initiated through INSAT of satellites are now providing climatic and meteorological information over the India enabling scientists to provide more accurate weather forecasting which is very essential for disaster prone arid regions. Subsequently, the satellite remote sensing data generated by IRS- 1 B LISS-II and IRS- 1 C LISS-III series of satellites has been assisting to promote sustainable resource development strategies at the micro-levels Such initiatives are based on continuous environmental monitoring of land and water resources including meteorological parameters using space informatic technology...|$|R

40|$|Long-term {{vegetation}} monitoring {{efforts have}} become increasingly important for understanding ecosystem response to global change. Many traditional methods for monitoring can be infrequent and limited in scope. Ground-based LiDAR is one remote sensing method that offers a clear advancement to monitor vegetation dynamics at high spatial and temporal resolution. We determined the effectiveness of LiDAR to detect intra-annual variability in vegetation structure at a long-term Sonoran <b>Desert</b> <b>monitoring</b> plot dominated by cacti, deciduous and evergreen shrubs. Monthly repeat LiDAR scans of perennial plant canopies {{over the course of}} one year had high precision. LiDAR measurements of canopy height and area were accurate with respect to total station survey measurements of individual plants. We found {{an increase in the number}} of LiDAR vegetation returns following the wet North American Monsoon season. This intra-annual variability in vegetation structure detected by LiDAR was attributable to a drought deciduous shrub Ambrosia deltoidea, whereas the evergreen shrub Larrea tridentata and cactus Opuntia engelmannii had low variability. Benefits of using LiDAR over traditional methods to census desert plants are more rapid, consistent, and cost-effective data acquisition in a high-resolution, 3 -dimensional context. We conclude that repeat LiDAR measurements can be an effective method for documenting ecosystem response to desert climatology and drought over short time intervals and at detailed-local spatial scale...|$|R

40|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to better {{understand}} the mummification processes associated with the pre-Inca culture known as the Chiribaya. The ancient Chiribaya used various textile wrappings that likely enhanced wicking of flu-ids out of the body thus increasing the potential for mummification. Here we examine the tomb environment itself as a probable factor in the poten-tial mummification of human remains. To reveal more about the Chiribaya mummification process, we replicated the physical characteristics of a Chirib-aya tomb in the Sonoran <b>Desert</b> and <b>monitored</b> the intra-tomb environmental changes while occupied by a swine analogue.

40|$|In arid and {{semiarid}} lands, canopy transpiration and its dynamics depend {{largely on}} stomatal sensitivity to drought. In this study, the sap flow of a dominant species, Haloxylon ammodendron growing in Central Asian <b>deserts,</b> was <b>monitored</b> using Granier-type sensors, {{from which the}} canopy stomatal conductance was derived. The responses of canopy transpiration and stomatal conductance to environmental variables {{during the second half}} of the growing season, when annual prolonged drought occurred, was analyzed for four continuous years, from 2013 to 2016. A soil water content (SWC) of 3 % was identified as the lower soil water threshold for this species, below which the plant lost the ability for stomatal regulation on water loss and suffered the risk of mortality. Above this threshold, the sensitivity of canopy transpiration to vapor pressure deficit, VPD (K), was linearly correlated with SWC, which mainly resulted from different stomatal behaviors at varying drought intensities. Stomatal sensitivity to VPD (m/Gsref) increased linearly with soil moisture deficit, inducing a shift from more anisohydric to a more isohydric stomatal behavior. The flexibility of stomatal behavior regarding soil drought was one key element facilitating the survival of H. ammodendron in such an extreme dry environment...|$|R
