40|$|Background: Interventions {{to reduce}} {{socio-economic}} inequalities in injury incidence should {{be tailored to}} specific priority areas that may be identified by descriptive studies. We aimed to {{provide an overview of}} existing socio-economic inequalities in injury incidence in the Netherlands and to assess the potential influence of methodological choices on the relationships found. Methods: Self-reported medically treated injuries (all injuries versus fractures) were derived from a survey among a random sample of 59 063 persons. Injuries resulting in hospital admissions (all injuries versus fractures) were derived from a prospective cohort study of 18 810 participants, linked to the National Hospital Discharge Register for a follow-up period of 7 years. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios of self-reported medically treated injuries and fractures by level of education, occupation and income, and of hospital-admitted injuries by level of education and occupation. Results: Socio-economic inequalities in injury incidence in the Netherlands were dependent on the indicator of non-fatal injury <b>incidence,</b> <b>indicator</b> of socio-economic status (SES) and studied cause of injury. In the majority of specific relations analyzed, injury risks were not or only moderately elevated in lower SES-classes. Analyses focusing on injury with higher severity levels (admitted injuries and/or admitted fractures) revealed the steepest SES gradient with odds ratios of injury of 1. 5 or more of the lowest socio-economic (educational) groups compared to persons with higher SES (education). In hospital admitted traffic injuries, we found the most striking difference with a threefold higher risk in the lowest educational groups. Conclusion: Future descriptive research into socio-economic differences in injury incidence should include all three core indicators of SES and separate analyses on the more severe injuries should be conducted...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: To {{review the}} {{scientific}} literature on pediatric abusive head trauma {{as a form of}} physical abuse against infants and young children, highlighting the prevalence, signs and symptoms, consequences, risk factors for its occurrence, and prevention strategies. Data source: The MEDLINE, SciELO, LILACS, and Web of Science databases from 2001 to 2012 were reviewed, using the terms “shaken baby syndrome” and “abusive head trauma” in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Data synthesis: Pediatric abusive head trauma is defined as injury to the skull or intracranial contents of a infant or child younger than 5 years due to intentional abrupt impact and/or violent shaking. It occurs mainly in infants and children under 1 year of age, and may result in severe consequences, from physical or mental disabilities to death. Although there are specific signs for this form of abuse, they can be mistaken for common illnesses in children or accidental head injury; thus, clinical training of professionals involved in the assessment of cases to attain the correct diagnosis is crucial. Prevention strategies should include early identification of cases, as well as parental education on child development, especially on the infant's crying pattern. Conclusions: Considering the severity of abusive head trauma in children, it is critical that prevention strategies be implemented and evaluated in the Brazilian context. It is suggested that its <b>incidence</b> <b>indicators</b> be assessed at the national level...|$|R

In {{order to address}} the necessity of having reliable and tangible indicators of macropore flow incidence, this research is an extensive data exploration that uncovers potential regional macropore flow <b>incidence</b> <b>indicators</b> that are synthesized as hypotheses for future research. CART-based regression trees are used to uncover significant relationships among soil physical properties, management regimes, field saturated hydraulic conductivity, saturated soil air-entry tensions and earthworm biomass. All of the modeling is based on field-measured data. Prediction scenarios are established {{in order to develop}} potential regional indicators of field saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs), soil saturated air-entry tension (AEV), and earthworm biomass. The magnitude, range, and pattern of variability of soil water infiltrations are controlled primarily by the well-developed and stable soil structure at the field scale, rather than by texture, organic carbon or surface topography, as classical pedotransfer functions suggest. Tillage is influential for the estimation of all targeted variables. Conventional tillage is associated with rapid shallow infiltration rates and lower air entry tensions both in the cultivation layer and below. Absence of tillage is found to be beneficial for earthworm communities as sampled biomass is greater on no-till field sites. The strong correlations between Kfs and AEV demonstrate good prediction potential but because of their intrinsic spatial and temporal variability, their utility as regional macropore flow indicators is questionable...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Worrying trends {{regarding}} human reproductive endpoints (e. g. semen quality, reproductive cancers) {{have been}} reported and there is growing circumstantial evidence for a possible causal link between these trends and exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). However, there is a striking lack of human data to fill the current knowledge gaps. To answer the crucial questions raised on human reproductive health, there is an urgent need for a reproductive surveillance system to be shared across countries. METHODS: A multidisciplinary network named HUman Reproductive health and Global ENvironment Network (HURGENT) was created aiming at designing a European monitoring system for reproductive health indicators. Collaborative work allowed setting up the available knowledge to design such a system. Furthermore we conducted an overview of 23 potential indicators, based upon a weight of evidence (WoE) approach according to their potential relation with EDC exposure. RESULTS: The framework and purposes of the surveillance system are settled {{as well as the}} approach to select suitable reproductive indicators. The indicators found with the highest scores according to the WoE approach are prostate and breast cancer incidence, sex ratio, endometriosis and uterine fibroid <b>incidence,</b> <b>indicators</b> related to the testicular dysgenesis syndrome, precocious puberty incidence and reproductive hormone levels. CONCLUSION: Not only sentinel health endpoints, but also diseases with high burdens in public health are highlighted as prior indicators in the context of EDC exposure.

Frequencies {{and rates of}} New Zealand's serious non-fatal self-harm indicators may be prone to fluctuations in reporting owing, for example, to changing social norms. Hence, they have been considered provisional. Aim: To validate empirically the serious non-fatal self-harm indicators. Methods: All serious non-fatal first admissions to hospital were identified and classified according to whether principal diagnosis (PDx) was injury or mental disorder, and conversely whether contributing diagnoses were mental disorder or injury. The proportion assigned self-harm external cause of injury code (E-code) was calculated for each year from 2001 to 2007. Subsequently, all cases with a self-harm E-code were identified, and the proportion with a PDx of injury and contributing diagnosis of mental disorder, or PDx of mental disorder and contributing diagnosis of injury over time, were determined.

40|$|During the {{transition}} period, cows {{are confronted with}} infectious and inflammatory challenges leading to an acute phase response (APR) marked by increased hepatic synthesis of positive acute phase reactants (+AP) {{and a decrease in}} negative acute phase reactants (-AP). The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the APR in 21 high-yielding dairy cows studied from 9 days before until 42 days after calving, and to assess the association between the APR, disease <b>incidence</b> and <b>indicators</b> of liver function. Repeated blood samples were analyzed for -AP (retinol, albumin, cholesterol), +AP (haptoglobin, caeruloplasmin), paraoxonase, and liver-associated variables (aspartate aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transferase, bilirubin). All cows displayed postpartum decreases in -AP and paraoxonase, and increases in +AP and liver variables. When retrospectively categorized, cows presenting a stronger -AP decline displayed higher +AP and liver variables, and a higher disease incidence compared to cows with a milder decline. Altogether, typical changes in -AP and +AP identify {{the transition}} period as a time of increased inflammatory load. Group differences in liver variables suggest that a more severe APR may be associated with altered liver function.

Method: Quantitative and retrospective study carried out from the research and review of data of registers supplied by a maternity of the city of São Paulo. We surveyed the registers of babies who were born from January through December of the years of 1995 (n= 2. 077) and 2005 (n= 5. 129), including those who had risk indicators for deafness and prematurity, low weight and asphyxia, besides having a diagnosis confirmed or suspicion of infecto-contagious diseases of group TORSCH-A. Results: We reviewed reports of 565 children born in 1995, and 1047 born in 2005. Among the risk indicators of deafness, we noticed a significant difference for the indicator of prematurity and asphyxia and {{there was no significant difference}} for the low weight indicator. The risk indicators of prematurity, low weight and asphyxia were more frequent than Toxoplasmosis, Syphilis and HIV+.

This study revealed many opportunities for HIV indicator condition-guided testing in primary care. As yet, however, HIV indicator conditions are not exploited as triggers for early HIV testin...|$|R
40|$|Background: Histoplasmosis is an endemic fungal {{infection}} in French Guiana. It {{is the most}} common AIDS-defining illness and the leading cause of AIDS-related deaths. Diagnosis is difficult, but in the past 2 decades, it has improved in this French overseas territory which offers an interesting model of Amazonian pathogen ecology. The objectives of the present study were to describe the temporal trends of <b>incidence</b> and mortality <b>indicators</b> for HIV-associated histoplasmosis in French Guiana. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted to describe early mortality rates observed in persons diagnosed with incident cases of HIV-associated Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum histoplasmosis admitted in one of the three main hospitals in French Guiana between 1992 and 2011. Early mortality was defined by death occurring within 30 days after antifungal treatment initiation. Data were collected on standardized case report forms and analysed using standard statistical methods. Results: There were 124 deaths (45. 3 %) and 46 early deaths (16. 8 %) among 274 patients. Three time periods of particular interest were identified: 1992 – 1997, 1998 – 2004 and 2005 – 2011. The two main temporal trends were: the proportion of early deaths among annual incident histoplasmosis cases significantly declined four fold (x 2, p, 0. 0001) and the number o...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} highly active {{antiretroviral}} therapy (HAART) can be evaluated using indicators, such as rates of opportunistic infections, hospitalizations by cause of infection, and associated death. This study aimed {{to estimate the}} impact of HAART on the <b>incidence</b> of these <b>indicators,</b> in children and adolescents with HIV/AIDS. It was a hybrid cohort study; 371 patients were followed from 1989 to 2003. In December 2003, 76 % of the patients were still being followed, while 12. 1 % had died, 9. 5 % had dropped out, and 2. 4 % had been transferred. The overall rate of opportunistic infections was 18. 32 infections/ 100 persons-year and 2. 63 in the pre- and post-HAART periods, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the risk of developing an opportunistic infection was 5. 4 times greater and 3. 3 times greater for hospitalization risk before HAART. Respiratory causes represented 65 % of the hospitalizations and they were reduced by 44. 6 % with therapeutic intervention. The average hospital stay of 15 days was reduced to 9. There was a post-HAART decline in deaths of 38 %. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of HAART in significantly reducing opportunistic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in this Brazilian cohort...|$|R
40|$|In 2012 the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology {{published}} 19 {{indicators of}} safety compromise. We studied the <b>incidence</b> of these <b>indicators</b> by reviewing all colonoscopies performed in St. John’s, NL, between January 1, 2012, and June 30, 2012. Results. A total of 3235 colonoscopies were included. Adverse events are as follows. Medication-related includes use of reversal agents 0. 1 %, hypoxia 9. 9 %, hypotension 15. 4 %, and hypertension 0. 9 %. No patients required CPR or experienced allergic reactions or laryngospasm/bronchospasm. The indicator, “sedation dosages in patients older than 70,” showed lower usage of fentanyl and midazolam in elderly patients. Procedure-related immediate includes perforation 0. 2 %, immediate postpolypectomy bleeding 0. 3 %, need for hospital admission or {{transfer to the}} emergency department 0. 1 %, and severe persistent abdominal pain proven not to be perforation 0. 4 %. Instrument impaction was not seen. Procedure-related delayed includes death within 14 days 0. 1 %, unplanned health care visit within 14 days of the colonoscopy 1. 8 %, unplanned hospitalization within 14 days of the colonoscopy 0. 6 %, bleeding within 14 days of colonoscopy 0. 2 %, infection 0. 03 %, and metabolic complication 0. 03 %. Conclusions. The most common adverse events were mild and sedation related. Rates of serious adverse events were in keeping with published reports...|$|R
40|$|The World OER Declaration 2012 {{recommends}} that States join efforts to facilitate finding, retrieving and sharing OER. The OER movement {{has thus far}} spurred the creation of numerous repository initiatives worldwide {{with the aim of}} aiding the development of Open Educational Practice. This paper is based on the analysis on a set of 80 repositories of OER. In order to evaluate the quality of repositories, a set of ten quality indicators was obtained from an analysis of key literature. These indicators represent good practices in repository design, as they enable repositories to promote openness, sharing, reuse of resources and collaboration amongst academic communities. The <b>incidence</b> of the <b>indicators</b> within the actual repositories of OER is discussed, with the aim of understanding {{the extent to which these}} good practices are commonplace across repositories when considered by type, region, and overall. Although there are numerous references in the OER literature to the importance of these features in repository design, the actual initiatives demonstrate quite heterogeneous approaches, and some indicators achieve very low incidence considering the crucial role they play in supporting the aims of the OER movement. The significance of the various indicators is considered in relation to questions of overlap, practicality and sustainability, in order to suggest directions for further investigation and ultimately the improvement of these important repositories...|$|R
40|$|To protect public health, {{detection}} {{methods have been}} developed to monitor drinking water for pathogens. The goal of this dissertation is to evaluate and utilize novel methods that enhances detection and further reduces the risk of waterborne pathogens. The study in Appendix A developed a method to monitor the microbial quality of treated drinking water at the tap utilizing point-of-use (POU) filter. Tap water supplies were monitored in vending machines throughout Southern Arizona using solid block carbon (SBC) filters as a monitoring tool. Out of 48 SBC filters 54. 2 % were positive for at least one organism. The number of filters positive for total coliforms, E. coli, Enterococci, and enterovirus was 13, 5, 19, and 3, respectively, corresponding to 27. 1 %, 10. 4 %, 39. 6 %, and 6. 3 % of the total filters. These results suggest that the SBC filter can be used to monitor large volumes of treated drinking water and detect the <b>incidence</b> of <b>indicators</b> and pathogens. The study in Appendix B evaluated the fate of infectious prions in multiple water sources quantitatively utilizing a method that only detects infectious prions. A reduction of PrPˢᶜ was observed at 25 °C and 37 °C ranging between 0. 41 -log₁₀ and 1. 4 -log₁₀ after 1 week. After 8 weeks at 25 °C and 37 °C, inactivation ranged between 1. 65 -log₁₀ and 2. 15 -log₁₀. A maximum rate of inactivation in water occurred at 50 °C, ranging from 2. 0 -log₁₀ and 2. 51 -log₁₀ after one week. The results from all types of water suggest that dissolved organic matter and temperature influence PrPˢᶜ infectivity. The study in Appendix C evaluated real-time sensors for monitoring microbial contaminants. Most sensor parameters evaluated exhibited an increase in sensor response to an increase in E. coli concentrations. Responses to E. coli concentrations at or below 10 ³ cfu/mL were very low due to near background levels, and responses to concentrations above 10 ⁶ cfu/mL exceeded threshold levels for sensors that use light scattering methods due to saturation in the flow cell. The data produced effectively shows that the sensors evaluated could be used to monitor microbial intrusion events in water distribution systems...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Tuberculosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} medical and social problems in the whole world as well as in Russia and its separate regions. Purpose. The study was aimed at assessment of tuberculosis epidemic situation in the Chechen Republic in the current socio-economic conditions after counterterrorist operations. Materials and methods. The authors analyzed the annual reports of the Ministry of Health of the Chechen Republic for 2010 – 2015, data of Rosstat, statistical data form for tuberculosis (№ 8 and № 30). Results. The results shown a threefold increase in the main tuberculosis <b>indicators</b> (<b>incidence,</b> prevalence and mortality) after counterterrorist operations (1994 – 1996), and a decrease in these indicators in 2010 – 2015. The authors have found the cities and rural municipal districts with the most and the least favorable tuberculosis situation. The study results demonstrated an increase in the number of patients with bacillary, with fibrous-cavernous form, as well as patients with tuberculosis in combination with HIV infection. The authors proved the relation between the prevalence of fibrous-cavernous form of tuberculosis and mortality rate. Tuberculosis incidence in children (0 – 14 years) and adolescents (15 – 17 years) decreased in 2010 – 2015 while the incidence in adolescents remains higher than the incidence in children. Conclusion. Effective antituberculosis work in the Chechen Republic needs to improve the quality of medical examinations, early detection of tuberculosis, timely immunization, and health education...|$|R
