The computational {{results indicate that the}} presence of the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> reactions extends mildly the micro-combustion stability limits at low and moderate inlet velocities due to the strong flames establishment, and have a more profound effect on extending the high-velocity blowout limits by allowing for additional heat release originating mainly from the incomplete CH 4 <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> oxidation in the plane channel. When the same mass flow rate (ρin × Vin) is considered, the micro-combustion stability limits at p: 0. 1 MPa are much narrower than at p: 0. 6 MPa due to both <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> and <b>catalytic</b> reaction activities decline with decreasing pressure.

Catalytically active components are dispersed uniformly {{over the whole}} porous ceramic monolith structure (so-called incorporated monolithic catalysts) or are in a layer of porous material that is deposited {{on the walls of}} channels in the monolith's structure (washcoated monolithic catalysts). The material of the main monolithic construction is not limited to ceramics but includes metals, as well. Monolithic catalysts are commonly used in <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> <b>catalytic</b> processes, such as treatment of automotive exhaust gases, selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides, catalytic removal of volatile organic compounds from industrial processes, etc. Monoliths continue to be the preferred support for environmental applications due to their high geometric surface area, different design options, low pressure drop, high temperature durability, mechanical strength, ease of orientation in a reactor and effectiveness as a support for a catalytic washcoat. As known, monolithic catalysts belong to the class of the structured catalysts and/or reactors (in some cases the distinction between "catalyst" and "reactor" has vanished). Structured catalysts can greatly intensify chemical processes, resulting in smaller, safer, cleaner and more energy efficient technologies.

40|$|The {{specific}} {{catalytic effect}} of a silica grain on the formation of methanol via the sequential addition of H atoms to CO adsorbed on the surface is investigated. A negatively charged defect on a siliceous edingtonite surface is found to reduce the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> barriers for the H + COads and H + H 2 C=O-ads reactions by 770 and 399 K, respectively, {{when compared to the}} same reactions in the <b>gas</b> <b>phase.</b> The <b>catalytic</b> effect of negatively charged surface sites could also be applicable to the hydrogenation of other adsorbed unsaturated species. However, the activation energies on the surface defect are still too large (1150 and 2230 K) for CH 3 OH to form efficiently at 10 - 20 K in the interstellar medium via a classical mechanism. It is therefore suggested that quantum mechanical tunnelling through the activation barrier is required for these hydrogen addition reactions to proceed at such temperatures. The calculations show that because the adsorption energies of CO and H 2 C=O on the negatively charged defect are substantial, CH 3 OH may form efficiently during the warm-up period in star-forming regions...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{coupling}} effects between homogeneous and heterogeneous (HH) chemistry {{is crucial in}} the field of high-temperature catalysis. An important example in this area is the catalytic oxidation of light hydrocarbons. Microreactor technology, with its precise control of fluid and temperature fields, improved reactant mixing, and large surface-to-volume ratio, is ideally suited for the study of such reaction systems. Most significantly, the pathways of homogeneous-heterogeneous coupling can be better understood as critical reactor dimensions are reduced into micrometer range, where diffusive flux starts to play an equally important role as convective transport. Here, we are reporting a novel modular microreactor system based on the use of silicon-based thin-film catalysts, which allows stable operation during thermal cycling up to 800 oC. Precise control and adjustment of the critical dimension, i. e. the height of reaction chamber, offers the ability to steer the relative importance of gas- and catalytic-phase chemistries due to transport of reactants between the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> and the <b>catalytic</b> walls. Additionally, a moveable thermocouple and quartz-glass capillary (connected to a mass spectrometer) allow the in-situ measurement of temperature and composition profiles in the reaction chamber. By combining these two capabilities, the system thus provides an efficient and sensitive way to investigate the interplay between <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> and <b>catalytic</b> chemistries, and to evaluate the catalytic performance of thin-film catalysts. The reactor system was tested using oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) as model reaction. OCM has been studied intensively for many decades and offers a potentially highly efficient path for direct upgrading of methane to higher-value C 2 products. The reaction is also well known to include catalytic steps in the generation of methyl radicals (as well as in undesired methane combustion) and homogeneous reaction steps in which methyl radicals are coupled to form the desired C 2 products (C 2 H 6 and C 2 H 4). It thus forms an ideal test system for the above described microreactor system. A La-based thin-film catalyst was deposited onto a silicon chip via dip-coating, characterized, and inserted into the microreactor. The effect of major reactor operating parameters, such as temperature, flow rate, C:O feed ratio, and, most importantly, the surface-to-volume ratio were tested in detailed experimental studies using both reactor outlet and spatially-resolved concentration profiles. The results show a strong decrease of C 2 production rates with decreasing microreactor channel height (680 µm to 460 and 330 µm), in agreement with the established OCM reaction mechanism. A 2 D FEM-based numeric model was also carried out to provide supports and further insights into OCM system. While the Pt- and Rh-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODH) is currently under investigation as the second model reaction, it is promising that this methodology can be transferred to study several other systems, e. g. hydrogen oxidation and catalytic partial oxidation of methane (CPOM) and propane (CPOP) ...|$|R
40|$|CFC (chloro{{fluorocarbons}}) and halons (brominated fluorocarbons or brominated CFCs) {{represent a}} group of stable chemicals exhibiting desirable properties for {{a broad range of}} industrial and consumer applications, including refrigeration, fire suppression and manufacturing of polymeric foams. Unfortunately, most of the applications involve dispersive use of the chemicals, prompting a concerted international action, embodied in the Montreal Protocol, to limit these dispersive applications. When released near the earth surface, halons and CFCs transfer preferentially to the Antarctic troposphere, where they undergo the photochemical activation to release bromine and chlorine radicals. Subsequently, both radicals enter the stratospheric <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> <b>catalytic</b> cycles responsible for the destruction of large amounts of ozone, with bromine being considerably more potent than chlorine. The damaged ozone layer can no longer function as an efficient filter for harmful ultraviolet radiation. The realisation of the health effects of this phenomenon arose public concern and resulted in phasing out the manufacturing of the ozone depleting chemicals, imposed by the Montreal Protocol, to allow the ozone layer to recover. Several developed countries broadened the scope of Protocol to restrain the use of recycled halons and CFC. Although handful of developing countries maintain a limited production of the ozone depleting chemicals, a complete phasing out of the production is imminent. The legislative action has been associated with the development of new technologies, which have radically transformed the halon and CFC dependent industries. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and hydrocarbons have replaced CFCs as refrigerants and blowing agents, water mist, HFCs, inert gases and foams have substituted halons as fire suppressants. Similar changes have affected other industries. At the same time, the unwanted and banned chemicals are accumulating in national banks, awaiting their final treatment. One approach to dispose the ozone depleting chemicals constitutes their burning in incinerators, cement kilns and specially designed thermal plasma reactors. However, such an approach entails energy inefficiencies, as halons and CFC exhibit high heat capacities and bond energies, and can lead to the formation of other pollutants, including dioxins and furans. An alternative route is to selectively cleave off the C����Cl and C–Br bonds, under well-controlled catalytic conditions, if possible preserving the valuable C–F bonds. This route produces mainly HFCs, which represent desirable chemicals, either in their own right or as precursors for manufacturing other compounds, including fluoroelastomers and CF₃I. Implied in this approach is a key paradigm shift, from considering halons and CFCs as brominated and chlorinated wastes to regarding them as valuable chemical feedstocks. From this perspective, this issue collects a selection of important advances in catalytic conversion of halons and CFCs to HFCs and other chemicals. Featured articles deal with hydrodechlorination of CFC- 12 (CCl₂F₂), CFC- 113 (C₂Cl₃F₃) and CFC- 114 (C₂Cl₂F₄), hydrodehalogenation of Halon 1211 (CBrClF₂), hydrolysis and dehalogenative oligomerisation of CFC- 12 and synthesis of CF₃I, over a very diverse group of catalysts.

40|$|Water {{has long}} been assumed to be {{essential}} for biological function. To understand the molecular basis {{of the role of}} water in protein function, several studies have established a correlation between enzyme activity and hydration level. While a threshold of hydration of 0. 2 h (grams of water per gram of dried protein) is usually accepted for the onset of enzyme activity, recent works show that enzyme activity is possible at water contents as low as 0. 03 h (Lind et al., 2004). Diffusion limitation in these experiments was avoided by monitoring enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of gas-phase esters. However, since water is also a substrate for the enzyme used in these experiments, they cannot be used to probe the possibility of activity at zero hydration. However, the pig liver esterase and C. rugosa lipase B are able to catalyse alcoholysis reactions in which an acyl group is transferred between an ester and an alcohol. Therefore, by following this reaction and using a <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> <b>catalytic</b> system, {{we have been able to}} show that activity can occur at 0 g/g. These results led to the question of the accuracy of determinations of very low water concentrations; i. e., how dry is 0 g/g? Although gravimetric measurements of the hydration level do not allow us to define the anhydrous state of the protein with sufficient sensitivity, using 18 O-labeled water, we have been able to quantify the small number of water molecules bound to the protein after drying, using a modification of the method of Dolman et al. (1997). Testing different drying methods, we have been able to determine a level of hydration as low as 2 moles of water per mole of protein (equivalent to 0. 0006 h in the case of pig liver esterase) and have shown that in the case of the pig liver esterase, activity can occur at this hydration level. At the molecular level, if the hydration level affects activity, we can expect an effect on the protein dynamics. Neutron scattering spectra of hydrated powders, for instance, show that diffusive motions of the protein increase with the hydration (Kurkal et al., 2005) To address the question of the protein motions involved in the onset of enzyme activity at low hydration, we performed neutron scattering experiments on a pico-second time scale on dried powders. Preliminary results show a dynamical transition at hydration levels as low as 3 h. Molecular dynamic simulations have also been used in this study to access the dynamics of the active site. Overall, the results here show that pig liver esterase can function at zero hydration, or as close to zero hydration as current methods allow us to determine. Since the experimental methodology restricts this work to a small number of enzymes, it is unlikely that it will ever be possible to determine if all enzymes can function in the anhydrous state: however, the results here indicate that water is not an obligatory requirement for enzyme function...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} a fast {{exothermic}} surface reaction on the fluid flow and on heat transfer between bulk <b>gas</b> <b>phase,</b> and the <b>catalytic</b> wall in a monolithic reactor has been studied {{by means of a}} 2 -D mathematical model. The radial profiles of temperature, concentration, and velocity in the ignition region show that the perturbation induced by the reaction is qualitatively comparable to the entrance effects. From the standpoint of heat transfer efficiency the channel may be divided into two zones, the first dominated by the entrance effects and the second dominated by the reaction effects. In the first zone the interphase heat transfer resembles the constant wall heat flux (NuH), while after ignition resembles the constant wall temperature (NuT) only once the perturbation generated by the reaction ignition has extinguished. It is, hence, showed that the Nu number may be calculated as the interpolation between NuH, and a modified Nusselt number Nuad, which is defined {{as a function of the}} difference between the adiabatic temperature and gas bulk temperature rather than wall-gas temperature difference. It is anchored to the ignition location, depends on the operating and kinetic parameters and asymptotically tends to NuT. © 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers...|$|R
40|$|Ever {{since the}} first {{experiments}} nearly three decades ago, microwave enhanced chemistry has received incessant scientific attention. Many studies report improved process performance in terms of speed and conversion under microwave exposure and therefore it is recognized as a promising alternative method of process activation. It has also raised skepticism though, since the mechanisms behind the process enhancement remain unclear. Nevertheless, {{in the context of}} process intensification, the combination of microwave fields and microreactor systems has a promising quality; the enhanced reaction rates of the former and the superior heat and mass transfer rates and tightly controlled processing conditions of the latter together may provide a well-controlled and highly intensified processing environment. The objective of this thesis is to explore the possibilities to apply a microwave field in microstructured reactor systems. The familiar (domestic) multimode cavity systems are discounted as a viable means to apply a microwave field to a microreactor; the electromagnetic conditions in such systems simply are too poorly defined and controlled. In order to give each molecule the same processing experience, the field applicator needs to apply a spatially uniform microwave field. Therefore it is investigated what the theoretical limitations are on the uniformity of the electromagnetic field and heating rate distribution under parametric variation in a hypothetical resonant system. Design charts are presented that illustrate how important operating, geometric and medium parameters relate with each other. It is demonstrated how these simple configurations can provide design guidelines and first approximations for more realistic process equipment geometries. In a next step, the practical limitations encountered in commonly applied cavity systems are investigated. To this end, a simple exemplary process was analyzed both by experiment and simulation. The process under consideration is heating of water contained in a vial inside a popular, off-the-shelf, single-mode microwave cavity device. Both the heating rate distribution and the overall heating rate are investigated as well as the sensitivity of these measures to parametric variation. It is found that the resonant microwave field in generic, non-tailored systems is highly sensitive to parametric variation, that the heating process is hard to predict, and that that such systems do not lend themselves for control or optimization. Currently, the types of microwave equipment that are used in microwave chemistry research are principally limited to the aforementioned generic microwave systems. To widen this scope, the potential of standard sized, rectangular waveguides to form a basis for microwave applicator systems is explored. It is demonstrated that such systems support microwave fields that are relatively simple and predictable, which enables a higher degree of adaption and optimization to fit specific process requirements. The feasibility of long residence time continuous flow processing under microwave activation is experimentally demonstrated in a novel reactor type that the rectangular waveguide uniquely supports. Up to this point only cavity systems that support resonant fields have been considered. Resonant conditions are associated with hard-to-predict electromagnetic field patterns, difficulty in controlling and optimizing heat generation, and intrinsic spatial non-uniformity. The novel Coaxial Traveling Microwave Reactor concept is proposed as a means to address these issues by avoiding resonance altogether. Thus the highly optimized processing conditions characteristic of microreactors may be retained. Two concept variants are presented, one for liquid phase processing and one for heterogeneous <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> <b>catalytic</b> reactions, respectively. A method to optimize the applicator geometry is demonstrated. The thesis is concluded by a discussion on the design principles that were identified {{in the course of the}} research and a on a framework for further development of equipment for electromagnetically enhanced chemical processing systems.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} net {{greenhouse}} gas emissions to zero (COP 21), several possible routes to utilize renewable sources in the energy and transport sector are discussed and investigated lately. For the air transport sector {{it seems likely that}} it will still rely on hydrocarbons in the near future. One possible process to synthesize these hydrocarbons is the power-to-liquid process. Two main steps in this process are the CO 2 -activation (syngas production via reverse water-gas shift reaction) and the subsequent Fischer-Tropsch process. In context of producing liquid fuels via Fischer-Tropsch, the syngas production unit has to be operated at elevated pressure up to 25 bar in order to run the process at a constant pressure level. The syngas production is an endothermic reaction which improves with higher reaction temperatures (700 °C- 900 °C) due to the state of equilibrium. However, most previous studies focus on the investigation of the reverse water-gas shift reaction (rWGS) at atmospheric pressure. The pressure dependency of side reactions, like methane and carbon formation, leads to different equilibrium concentrations and therefore the pressure influence cannot be neglected. Then again, studies conducted at elevated pressure use stainless steel tubes as reactor tubes, which catalyze the reaction due to their nickel content. Therefor these experimental results combine both catalytic pathways which cannot be separated easily. In this study a novel reactor set-up is introduced, which enables to investigate heterogeneously catalyzed reactions at high temperature and elevated pressure. This setup consists of a glass tube in which the catalyst is inserted. Therefor only <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> and <b>catalytic</b> reaction at the catalyst are likely to occur. The glass tube is surrounded by an electric heating wire to heat the gas to reaction temperature. On both ends of the glass tube the temperature has to be far lower than 700 °C because otherwise the wall catalysis at the stainless steel tube would falsify the results. The electric wire is wrapped in glass wool in order to isolate the reaction chamber and to prevent the outer pressure stressed stainless steel tube from high temperature impact...|$|R
40|$|The H 2 + 1 / 2 O 2 H 2 O {{reaction}} on hot platinum surfaces {{has been}} studied. A stagnation flow geometry was {{used with a}} gas mixture of H 2 and O 2 at subatmospheric pressures. Experimental data of the OH concentration outside the surface were measured with Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence, PLIF, while Second Harmonic Generation, SHG, {{was used to determine}} the coverage on the surface. Detailed simulations of surface chemistry, mass-transport effects, and gas-phase chemistry, as well as the interaction between them, were performed with Chemkin. The formation energy of H 2 O and OH was found to be 67 kJ/mol, while the desorption energy of OH was 250 kJ/mol. It was also found that, for pressures up to 130 Pa, the OH molecules that desorb from the surface are not influenced by the gas-phase chemistry. At higher pressures the desorbed OH molecules are partially consumed in reactions with gas-phase species. Increasing the pressure even more will result in a reactive <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> where water is produced. Comparison with an inert glass surface showed that the catalytic surface strongly inhibits the gas-phase ignition. An explanation of this behaviour is that gas-phase radicals adsorb onto the surface and form less reactive species, such as water. In this way the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> outside a <b>catalytic</b> surface becomes depleted of reactive radicals. Sensitivity analysis was also used to study the complex surface/gas interaction. In another study elastic light scattering from a fuel spray was studied. Image processing was used in an attempt to reproduce the internal structure of the spray, despite the problems with strong attenuation due to substantial scattering from the spray. The numerical implementation was based on the Beer-Lambert's law for an inhomogeneous medium. The method was partially successful, although, calibration studies of the scattered light dependence on spray structure and droplet density will need to be included in future work...|$|R
40|$|SummaryExtended all-atom {{molecular}} dynamics simulations on all protein metafolds {{have been performed}} to obtain a complete picture of the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> proteome. The structural atlas of the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> proteome obtained here shows an unexpected maintenance of the global and local structure and of the general deformability pattern upon transfer to the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> under electrospray conditions. Despite a general compression, the solution structure can be easily very well recognized from the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> one, and most structural details, such as secondary structure, are well preserved upon vaporization. Rehydration of the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> protein leads in most cases to a very fast transition from <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> to solution structure. Overall, our massive analysis (over 4  μs in solution and over 12 μs in the <b>gas</b> <b>phase)</b> demonstrates that solution-like structures can be determined by using mass spectroscopy and related techniques to obtain fast approximations to the solution structure...|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} {{simulating}} vertical water level fluctuations with coupled liquid and <b>gas</b> <b>phases</b> is presented. The Preissmann implicit scheme {{is used to}} linearize the governing equations for one-dimensional transient flow for both liquid and <b>gas</b> <b>phases,</b> and the linear system is solved using the chasing method. Some classical cases for single liquid and <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> transients in pipelines and networks are studied to verify that the proposed methods are accurate and reliable. The implicit scheme is extended using a dynamic mesh to simulate the water level fluctuations in a U-tube and an open surge tank without consideration of the <b>gas</b> <b>phase.</b> Methods of coupling liquid and <b>gas</b> <b>phases</b> are presented and used for studying the transient process and interaction between the <b>phases,</b> for <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> limited in a chamber and <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> transported in a pipeline. In particular, two other simplified models, one neglecting {{the effect of the}} <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> on the liquid phase and the other one coupling the liquid and <b>gas</b> <b>phases</b> asynchronously, are proposed. The numerical results indicate that the asynchronous model performs better, and are finally applied to a hydropower station with surge tanks and air shafts to simulate the water level fluctuations and air speed...|$|R

Whilst prolonged exposure to particulate matter (PM) associated reactive oxygen species (ROS) {{have been shown to}} lead to negative health effects, the potential for compounds in <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> to cause similar effects is yet to be understood. In this study we describe: the significance of the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> OP generated through vehicle emissions; discuss the origin and evolution of species contributing to measured OP; and report on the impact of <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> OP on human lung cells. The model aerosol for this study was exhaust emitted from a Euro III Common-rail diesel engine fuelled with different blends of diesel and biodiesel. The <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> of these emissions was found to be potentially as hazardous as the particle phase. Fuel oxygen content was found to negatively correlate with the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> OP, and positively correlate with particle phase OP. This signifies a complex interaction between reactive species present in <b>gas</b> and particle <b>phase.</b> Furthermore, this interaction has an overarching effect on the OP of both particle and <b>gas</b> <b>phase,</b> and therefore the toxicity of combustion emissions...|$|R

40|$|Simultaneous {{measurements}} {{of both the}} carrier <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> and the dispersed particulate phase were carried out inside a curved 90 ° duct bend using Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA). These measurements were undertaken in order to investigate the effects of dilute turbulent particulate flows on the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> and vice versa. The main objective {{of the current study}} is to decipher the effect of the particles on to the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> at both the mean {{as well as at the}} turbulence level. Glass spheres with mean diameter of 77 µm were used to represent the solid phase, while the carrier phase has a working Reynolds number of Re= 1. 0 × 105 (bulk velocity Uo= 10 m/s). The <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> results were analyzed as both clean gas (without any particles) and unclean gas (with particles). The unclean gas results were separated from the particles based on their size in the post-processing step of the laser data. At the mean level, the velocities of the unclean <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> &# 039;lagged&# 039; behind the clean gas from the mid section of the duct towards the inner bend. Almost, the same feature is observed along the vertical duct past the 90 ° bend.
