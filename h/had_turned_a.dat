5|$|Pound was 36 {{when he met}} the 26-year-old American violinist Olga Rudge in Paris in late 1922, {{beginning}} a love affair that lasted 50 years. Biographer John Tytell believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> blind eye to over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he complained {{that he had been}} there for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress Natalie Barney in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the Boulevard Saint-Germain. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy Youngstown, Ohio, steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the Right Bank, socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the Left Bank. They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with George Antheil to apply the concept of Vorticism to music, and managed to write two operas, including Le Testament de Villon. He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.|$|E

25|$|In addition, the Marshall Plan forced German companies, as well {{as those}} in all of Western Europe, to {{modernize}} their business practices and take account of the international market. Marshall Plan funding helped overcome bottlenecks in the surging economy caused by remaining controls (which were removed in 1949), and Marshall Plan business reforms opened up a greatly expanded market for German exports. Overnight, consumer goods appeared in the stores, because they could be sold for realistic prices, emphasizing to Germans that their economy <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> corner.|$|E
25|$|Baker's first successor, Monsignor Joseph Maguire, {{took charge}} of the efforts to {{refurbish}} the structures. He had the marble towers replaced with the lower, enclosed, copper dome-tipped towers that still top the basilica today. Following the harsh winter of 2001-2002, the roof of the National Shrine was found to have significantly deteriorated. Its copper <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> greenish hue due to overexposure to the elements (a similar chemical effect as seen on the Statue of Liberty) and was no longer weather tight. A new copper roof was installed.|$|E
25|$|With {{the sounds}} of battle echoing in the distance, Lt. Col. Manuel Chaves of the 2nd New Mexico Infantry, {{commander}} of the New Mexican volunteers, informed Maj. Chivington that his scouts had located the Confederate supply train at Johnson's Ranch. After watching the supply train for an hour, Chivington's force descended the slope and attacked, driving off or capturing the small guard with few casualties on either side. They then looted and burned 80 supply wagons and spiked the cannon, either killing or driving off about 500 horses and mules before returning with their prisoners to Kozlowski's Ranch. With no supplies to sustain his advance, Scurry had to retreat to Santa Fe, the first step on the long road back to San Antonio, Texas. Thanks to Chaves' assistance, the Federals <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> defeat into victory and stopped further Confederate advances in the Southwest. Glorieta Pass was therefore the turning point {{of the war in}} the New Mexico Territory.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 2015, the {{university}} was given $4 million from the estate of Robert Morin, {{who had been a}} librarian at the university for almost 50 years. Having lived a frugal and secluded life, he allowed for his life's savings to be given to the university without restraint. In 2016, the news that the university was spending $1 million on a new video screen for the football stadium provoked criticism, on and off-campus, with critics noting that the difference between that amount and the $100,000 the university transferred to the library was jarring. A story on Deadspin connected the money for the video screen to the amount of money spent on football and other sports at UNH, arguing that UNH <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> small hobby of Morin's, watching football during the last months of his life, into an excuse to spend a quarter of his gift on a video screen.|$|E

[...] While the Canadiens and St. Patricks prepared {{to play in a}} semi-final playoff round, the Tigers' players, upset that the team <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> sizable profit despite claiming financial difficulty, went on strike to demand a C$200 playoff bonus each. [...] Threatened with fines, suspension and a possible lawsuit by league president Frank Calder, the players, led by Billy Burch and Shorty Green, held firm. [...] Calder then suspended the entire team and declared Montreal the NHL champions after they defeated Toronto in the semi-final.|$|E
500|$|Despite the support, the resignations ended Eddy's time in Lynn. The {{church was}} {{struggling}} and her reputation had {{been damaged by}} the disputes. By now 61 years old, she {{decided to move to}} Boston, and in early 1882 rented a house at 569 Columbus Avenue, a silver plaque announcing the arrival of the Massachusetts Metaphysical College. The college's prospectus, published in 1884, offered three diplomas: Christian Scientist (C.S.) for Christian Scientists' Association members; Christian Metaphysician (C.M.) for Eddy's 12-lesson course and three years' practice; and Doctor of Christian Science (D.C.S.) for C.M.s whose [...] "life and character conform to Divine science." [...] Students could study metaphysics, science of the scriptures, mental healing and obstetrics, using two textbooks, Science and Health and the Bible. Between 1881 and October 1889, when Eddy closed the college, 4,000 students took the course at $300 per person or married couple, making her a rich woman. Mark Twain wrote that she <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> sawdust mine (possibly Quimby's) into a Klondike.|$|E

2500|$|September 22: China's premier Wen Jiabao {{delivered}} a strong-worded address: [...] "I strongly urge Japan to release Zhan Qixiong immediately and unconditionally" [...] when {{he attended the}} general assembly of the United Nations in New York.

2500|$|When Tambor had sailed {{across in}} front of the line of cruisers in an effort to see them more clearly, the lead ship had sighted the sub and ordered a change of course. [...] Mogami <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> bit late and had {{collided}} with , sailing just {{in front of}} her, and 40 feet of her bow was compressed and pushed nearly perpendicular {{to the rest of the}} ship. [...] The next day, based on Tambor's report, and following the oil slick, dive bombers found the two damaged cruisers and their destroyer escorts and were able to sink Mikuma—the largest Japanese non-carrier sunk to that point in the war. [...] This proved to be Tambor's best (and among her only) contribution to the battle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{problem was}} that those same privateers in peacetime were often engaged in acts of pure piracy or smuggling, which they {{continued}} in war but {{in the name of}} the King! [...] Young would have got on better with the locals if he <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Nelsonian blind eye." [...] Young felt however that he had to stamp on them as apart from anything else he was finding it next to impossible to recruit local seamen and he feared desertion from his own ships to the better conditions and lure of money of the privateers. Further the privateers were all unlicensed so the navy had no control over them at all. The dispute was finally resolved when the local governors were empowered to licence privateers, which brought some limited measure of control. In return the legal proceedings against James and his officers were dropped.|$|E
2500|$|In any event, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas {{became a}} {{benchmark}} in American literature about U.S. {{society in the}} early 1970s. In Billboard magazine, Chris Morris said, [...] "Through Duke and Gonzo's drug-addled shenanigans amid the seediness of the desert pleasure palaces, it perfectly captured the zeitgeist of the post–'60s era". In Rolling Stone magazine, Mikal Gilmore wrote that the novel [...] "peers into {{the best and worst}} mysteries of the American heart" [...] and that Thompson [...] "sought to understand how the American dream <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> gun on itself". Gilmore believes that [...] "the fear and loathing Thompson was writing about — a dread of both interior demons and the psychic landscape of the nation around him — wasn't merely his own; he was also giving voice to the mind-set of a generation that had held high ideals and was now crashing hard against the walls of American reality".|$|E

2500|$|By the mid-1970s, however, {{managerial}} neglect {{was taking}} a toll on the park's condition. [...] "Years of poor management and inadequate maintenance <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> masterpiece of landscape architecture into a virtual dustbowl by day and a danger zone by night", {{in the opinion of}} Douglas Blonsky, a president of the Central Park Conservancy. Vandalism, territorial use (e.g. a pick-up game of softball or association football, which commandeered open space and excluded others), and illicit activities were taking place in the park. Several volunteer citizen groups emerged, intent upon reclaiming the park by fundraising and organizing volunteer initiatives. One of these groups, the Central Park Community Fund, commissioned a study of the park's management. The study's conclusion was bi-linear; it called for establishment of a single position within the New York City Parks Department, responsible for overseeing both the planning and management of Central Park, as well as a board of guardians to provide citizen oversight.|$|E
2500|$|U.S. {{military}} forces {{were instructed to}} begin maneuvers and activities within the restrictions of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, such as ignoring PDF roadblocks and conducting short-notice [...] "Category Three" [...] military exercises on security-sensitive targets, with the express goal of provoking PDF soldiers. U.S. SOUTHCOM kept a list of abuses against U.S. servicemen and civilians by the PDF while the orders to incite PDF soldiers were in place. As for the Panamanian legislature's declaration {{of a state of}} war between the U.S. and Panama, Noriega insists that this statement referred to a state of war directed by the U.S. against Panama, in the form of what he claimed were harsh economic sanctions and constant, provocative military maneuvers (Operations Purple Storm and Sand Flea) that were prohibited by the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. The U.S. <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> blind eye to Noriega's involvement in drug trafficking since the 1970s. Noriega was then singled out for direct involvement in these drug trafficking operations due to the widespread public knowledge of his involvement in money laundering, drug activities, political murder, and human rights abuses.|$|E
2500|$|Degas {{began to}} paint early in life. By {{the time he}} {{graduated}} from the Lycée with a baccalauréat in literature in 1853, at age 18, he <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> room in his home into an artist's studio. Upon graduating, he registered as a copyist in The Louvre Museum, but his father expected him to go to law school. Degas duly enrolled at the Faculty of Law of the University of Paris in November 1853, but applied little effort to his studies. In 1855 he met Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, whom Degas revered and whose advice he never forgot: [...] "Draw lines, young man, and still more lines, both from life and from memory, and you will become a good artist." [...] In April of that year Degas was admitted to the École des Beaux-Arts. He studied drawing there with Louis Lamothe, under whose guidance he flourished, following the style of Ingres. In July 1856, Degas traveled to Italy, where he would remain for the next three years. In 1858, while staying with his aunt's family in Naples, he made the first studies for his early masterpiece The Bellelli Family. He also drew and painted numerous copies of works by Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, and other Renaissance artists, but—contrary to conventional practice—he usually selected from an altarpiece a detail that had caught his attention: a secondary figure, or a head which he treated as a portrait.|$|E
