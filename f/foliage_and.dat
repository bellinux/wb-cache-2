5|$|Banksia aculeata, {{commonly}} known as prickly banksia, is a species of plant of the family Proteaceae native to the Stirling Range in the southwest of Western Australia. A shrub up to 2m (7ft) tall, it has dense <b>foliage</b> <b>and</b> leaves with very prickly serrated margins. Its unusual pinkish, pendent (hanging) flower spikes, known as inflorescences, are generally hidden in the <b>foliage</b> <b>and</b> appear during the early summer. Although it was collected by the naturalist James Drummond in the 1840s, Banksia aculeata was not formally described until 1981—by Alex George in his monograph of the genus.|$|E
5|$|B.sphaerocarpa var. caesia, first {{described}} by Alex George in his 1981 {{revision of the}} genus, grows larger than most other varieties, reaching , or occasionally , in height. It has yellow blooms and bluish grey <b>foliage</b> <b>and</b> {{is found in the}} central and southern Wheatbelt between the towns of Piawaning, Kojonup, Newdegate and Corrigin.|$|E
5|$|Bobcats and bullsnakes hunt smaller animals, such as deer {{mice and}} white-tailed {{antelope}} squirrels in the park's riparian zones. Western pipistrelle bats feast on insects, and pallid bats eat beetles, centipedes, cicadas, praying mantises, scorpions, and other arthropods. On the Painted Desert rim, small animals find {{food and shelter}} among the denser <b>foliage,</b> <b>and</b> mule deer sometimes frequent the area.|$|E
50|$|The fruits <b>and</b> <b>foliage</b> contain ranunculine, <b>and</b> {{are often}} {{reported}} to contain protoanemonin.|$|R
50|$|At Beja, the {{whitewashed}} {{church of}} Santo Amaro {{is one of}} just four pre-Romanesque churches left in Portugal. Some parts date from the sixth century and the interior columns and capitals are carved with <b>foliages</b> <b>and</b> geometric designs from the seventh century.|$|R
50|$|The motifs in {{the decorations}} also vary. Generally, they are nature themes, and {{can range from}} flowers, <b>foliages</b> <b>and</b> landscapes to animals, with a strong {{preference}} for the rabbit. The result is a perfectly finished work, of lively colors and entirely unique.|$|R
5|$|Chantenay carrots. Although {{the roots}} are shorter than other cultivars, they have {{vigorous}} <b>foliage</b> <b>and</b> greater girth, being broad in {{the shoulders and}} tapering towards a blunt, rounded tip. They store well, have a pale-coloured core and are mostly used for processing. Cultivars include 'Carson Hybrid' and 'Red Cored Chantenay'.|$|E
5|$|Danvers carrots. These {{have strong}} <b>foliage</b> <b>and</b> the roots are longer than Chantaney types, {{and they have}} a conical shape with a {{well-defined}} shoulder, tapering to a point. They are somewhat shorter than Imperator cultivars, but more tolerant of heavy soil conditions. Danvers cultivars store well and are used both fresh and for processing. They were developed in 1871 in Danvers, Massachusetts. Cultivars include 'Danvers Half Long' and 'Danvers 126'.|$|E
5|$|Dromedaries {{are mainly}} active during {{daylight}} hours. They form herds of about 20 individuals, which {{are led by}} a dominant male. This camel feeds on <b>foliage</b> <b>and</b> desert vegetation; several adaptations, {{such as the ability}} to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, allow it to thrive in its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a gestation of 15 months.|$|E
5000|$|The stems, roots <b>and</b> <b>foliage</b> are poisonous, <b>and</b> {{the berries}} can be toxic or cause nausea if eaten raw.|$|R

5|$|In Predynastic and Early Dynastic times, the Egyptian climate {{was much}} less arid than it is today. Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates. <b>Foliage</b> <b>and</b> fauna were far more {{prolific}} in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians, and {{this is also the}} period when many animals were first domesticated.|$|E
5|$|In the Margaret River region, Banksia ilicifolia {{has been}} {{confused}} with Banksia sessilis var. cordata as both have prickly <b>foliage</b> <b>and</b> domed flowerheads. However, the former grows on deep sand {{while the latter}} grows on grey sand over limestone ridges. The embedded follicles of B. ilicifolia compared with the loose ones of B. sessilis are another distinguishing feature.|$|E
5|$|The {{closely related}} Proserpine bottle tree (Brachychiton compactus) that occurs {{only in the}} {{vicinity}} of the town of Proserpine can be distinguished by its more oval leaves, more compact flower heads, and longer ellipsoid follicles. The undescribed Ormeau bottle tree has brighter lime-green new <b>foliage</b> <b>and</b> leaves but is otherwise similar to the Proserpine bottle tree.|$|E
50|$|Eremaea pauciflora is an erect, {{spreading}} or densely <b>foliaged</b> <b>and</b> rounded shrub sometimes {{growing to}} {{a height of}} 2 m. The leaves are 2.9-7.9 mm long, 0.6-3.3 mm wide, linear to narrow egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base. Sometimes one or 3 veins are visible on the lower surface.|$|R

5|$|The tree {{previously}} {{dominated the}} valley's farmed and grazed land, {{due to its}} height and full <b>foliage,</b> <b>and</b> was visible from a long distance, as is shown in old photographs. However, much of the surrounding land has now {{been taken over by}} forest, and Pi de les Tres Branques now has many other trees in its vicinity, which, together with its current skeletal form, make it much less visible than before.|$|E
5|$|Typically nocturnal (active at night), {{the royal}} {{antelope}} exhibits remarkable alertness. Territories are marked with dung. A herbivore, the royal antelope prefers small quantities of fresh <b>foliage</b> <b>and</b> shoots; fruits and fungi {{may be taken}} occasionally. Like other neotragines, the royal antelope is monogamous. Both sexes can become sexually mature by as early as six months. Births {{have been reported in}} November and December. A single, delicate young is born after an unknown gestational period.|$|E
5|$|A herbivore, {{the royal}} {{antelope}} prefers small quantities of fresh <b>foliage</b> <b>and</b> shoots; fruits and fungi {{may be taken}} occasionally. Though the antelope {{is considered to be}} nocturnal, zoologist Jonathan Kingdon holds that feeding occurs throughout the day, though some foraging may also be observed at night. In comparison to Bates's pygmy antelope, the royal antelope has a longer muzzle, broader lips, a smaller mouth and smaller cheek muscles. These features do not allow complete digestion of lignified growth. Individuals may often move into new locations foraging for fresh growth.|$|E
50|$|The corps de logis which {{contains}} {{the remains of}} the lower-hall and upper-hall, also has a large magnificent Gothic dormer window, made of real stone lacing, with a double projection of formed crockets, creeping <b>foliages,</b> <b>and</b> grotesques on a high roofing of the era. Its elegant pediment with pinnacles is stamped with four escutcheons.|$|R
50|$|Pittosporum phillyreoides, a name still seen used in {{the plant}} nursery trade, is {{cultivated}} as an ornamental tree for planting in gardens. It has a somewhat columnar growth with weeping form <b>and</b> <b>foliage</b> texture, <b>and</b> is drought tolerant once established.|$|R

5|$|At the {{northern}} end of the undercroft is the passage known as the outer parlour. This has stone benches on each side and elaborately carved blind arcades above them. The arcades each consist of two groups of four round-headed arches with capitals, free-standing columns and bases that are set on the benches. The capitals and mouldings of the arches are decorated with a variety of carvings, the capitals being predominantly late Romanesque in style and the arches early Gothic. The carvings include depictions of human heads, stiff-leaf <b>foliage</b> <b>and</b> animals.|$|E
5|$|B. coccinea is a {{host for}} the gall midge Dasineura banksiae, {{a species of}} fly that attacks and lays eggs on the leaves between late October and early December. The round white hairy galls are 5–7mm in {{diameter}} and generally contain one larva, or up to five on severely infested plants. The larvae moult and feed until January to March, when they reduce activity until early October. Although these are not harmful to the plant, they disfigure the cut <b>foliage</b> <b>and</b> hence reduce its value.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} to flower from seed, {{though there is a}} report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new <b>foliage</b> <b>and</b> the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E

5|$|Brachychiton rupestris {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a host plant for the mistletoe species Dendrophthoe glabrescens. Insects hosted by the species include the pale cotton stainer bug, a pest of cotton crops, and the kurrajong leaf roller caterpillar that chews on the <b>foliage</b> <b>and</b> rolls individual leaves, within which it then pupates. Bottle tree scrub is a key habitat of the near threatened black-breasted buttonquail. Brachychiton rupestris can withstand bushfires and responds by flowering and putting forth new foliage afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Hunters of game {{have long}} {{made use of}} {{camouflage}} {{in the form of}} materials such as animal skins, mud, <b>foliage,</b> <b>and</b> green or brown clothing to enable them to approach wary game animals. Field sports such as driven grouse shooting conceal hunters in hides (also called blinds or shooting butts). Modern hunting clothing makes use of fabrics that provide a disruptive camouflage pattern; for example, in 1986 the hunter Bill Jordan created cryptic clothing for hunters, printed with images of specific kinds of vegetation such as grass and branches.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, {{there was}} also severe wind damage in Palm Beach. A few {{buildings}} constructed by Henry Flagler, such as The Breakers, the Royal Poinciana Hotel, and Whitehall were damaged. At the Royal Poinciana, the hotel's botanical garden, which contained hundreds of exotic trees and plants, was almost completely destroyed. The golf club suffered severe roof damage, while the course was flooded with several inches to several feet of water. Waves inundated and swept away the <b>foliage</b> <b>and</b> trees {{at the house of}} J. Leonard Replogle.|$|E
50|$|Eremophila canaliculata is a low, spreading, densely <b>foliaged</b> <b>and</b> highly {{aromatic}} shrub {{growing to}} about 0.6 m high and 1 m wide. The leaves are arranged alternately and crowded near {{the ends of}} the branches. They are mostly 23-42 mm long, 4-8 mm wide, and densely hairy, their margins are serrated and there is a groove along the centre of the upper surface.|$|R
