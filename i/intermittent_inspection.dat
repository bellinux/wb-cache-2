At that time, she was designated a target ship for the atomic tests to be conducted at Bikini Atoll that summer. She survived both blasts at Bikini in July. On 29 August 1946, she was decommissioned.

40|$|<b>Intermittent</b> {{non-destructive}} <b>inspection</b> {{has been}} used since long time for checking the integrity of load-carrying structures and mechanical components. With the tremendous contemporary development of sensor technology, in conjunction with advanced wireless communications {{and the support of}} the massive computation facilities, continuous monitoring of structural damage during operation and time-continuously assessment of structural integrity, for the prediction of structural remaining life, in conditions of reliable and optimized costs of operation, is, nowadays, a vigorous endeavour for the next years to come. The article addresses the scientific and engineering bases of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) comparatively with the traditional approach to structural inspection and reliability assessment, outlining that beyond the new sensing sophisticated technology, much of the well-established methods based on models derived from fracture mechanics, quantitative non-destructive testing evaluation in probabilistic quantitative terms, are naturally integrated in SHM technology. The article is focused on civil aircraft structures outlining how the conjoint construct of Probabilistic Fracture Mechanics (PFM) and methods of quantitative non-destructive inspection (NDI) is implemented in SHM evaluations with the aid of massive computer simulations. Probabilistic substantiated of the warning time at the attainment of various levels of fatigue crack extension in the skin of a fuselage structure is assessed having as support a virtual SHM system which simulates acquired data processing performed onboard or in remote stations by wireless data transmission. A comparison of failure risk prediction is presented when aircraft operate under risk management applying intermittent NDI at scheduled inspection time (when the aircraft is grounded) {{on the one hand and}} continuous in time by SHM, on the other hand. The reported results are intended to demonstrate that by integration of existing assessment methodologies of PFM coupled with quantitative NDI can parallel SHM by massive computer simulation having as a result refined prognostics and management of failure risks and optimization of operational costs...|$|R
40|$|Noting the {{similarity}} between the illusion decrement and selective adaptation paradigms, Long has challenged the view that illusion decrement effects reflect a strategic [...] {{as opposed to a}} structural [...] underlying mechanism, and has called for further research on this issue. To investigate the confound between prolonged free inspection and repeated trials in the standard decrement procedure, the effects of three inspection conditions (continuous, intermittent, and immediate) on the magnitude of the overestimation Mueller-Lyer illusion have been assessed under two levels of trials (a total of two or six judgments). Significant illusion decline was found only under conditions of repeated trials, with either continuous or <b>intermittent</b> <b>inspection.</b> These findings do not support the predictions of purely structural theories (including neural adaptation and efferent readiness theories), according to which degree of decrement should be determined solely by viewing time. Instead, the data demonstrate that illusion decrement is a product of practice, providing converging evidence for the view of decrement as involving a cognitive 'recalibration' or learning process...|$|E
40|$|Event history studies {{based on}} disease clinic data often face several complications. Specifically, {{patients}} visit the clinic irregularly, and the <b>intermittent</b> <b>inspection</b> times {{depend on the}} history of disease-related variables; this can cause event or failure times to be dependently interval-censored. Furthermore, failure times could be truncated, treatment assignment is non-randomized and can be confounded, and there are competing risks of the failure time outcomes under study. I propose a class of inverse probability weights applied to estimating functions so that the informative inspection scheme and confounded treatment are appropriately dealt with. As a result, the distribution of failure time outcomes can be consistently estimated. I consider parametric, non- and semi-parametric estimation. Monotone smoothing techniques are employed in a two-stage estimation procedure for the non- or semi-parametric estimation. Simulations for a variety of failure time models are conducted for examining the finite sample performances of proposed estimators. This research is initially motivated by the Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) Toronto Cohort Study at the Toronto Western Hospital and the proposed methodologies are applied to this cohort study as an illustration...|$|E
40|$|Use of progression-free {{survival}} {{in the evaluation of}} clinical interventions is hampered by a variety of issues, including censoring patterns not addressed in the usual methods for survival analysis. Progression can be right-censored before survival or interval-censored between inspection times. Current practice calls for imputing events to their time of detection. Such an approach is prone to bias, underestimates standard errors and makes inefficient use of the data at hand. Moreover a composite outcome prevents inference about the actual treatment effect on the risk of progression. This thesis develops semiparametric and sieve maximum likelihood estimators to more formally analyze progression-related endpoints. For the special case where death rarely precedes progression, a Cox-Aalen model is proposed for regression analysis of time-to-progression under <b>intermittent</b> <b>inspection.</b> The general setting considering both progression and survival is examined with a Markov Cox-type illness-death model under various censoring schemes. All of the resulting estimators globally converge to the truth slower than the parametric rate, but their finite-dimensional components are asymptotically efficient. Numerical studies suggest that the new methods perform better than their imputation-based alternatives under moderate to large samples having higher rates of censoring. 1 yea...|$|E
40|$|Probabilistic {{methods for}} failure risk {{assessment}} are introduced, {{with reference to}} load carrying structures, such as pressure vessels (PV) and components of pipes systems. The definition of the failure risk associated with structural integrity {{is made in the}} context of the general approach to structural reliability. Sources of risk are summarily outlined with emphasis on variability and uncertainties (V&U) which might be encountered in the analysis. To highlight the problem, in its practical and analysis perspective, a short account is given on the nature of failures encountered in pressure vessels and pipe systems, with essential statistical data of service failure. Two engineering analysis tools are invoked: probabilistic fracture mechanics (PFM) and quantitative non-destructive inspection (QNDI). Probabilistic models for risk estimation, in terms of failure probability, are introduced in the classical view of full distribution approach (convolution integral computation) and direct Monte Carlo random simulation of the governing input variables implied in the failure model. The considered end-failure criterion operates with a performance function derived from the elastic-plastic Dugdale crack model, formalized in the failure assessment diagram (FAD) methodology. In the analysis are also integrated probability of detection (POD) models which quantify the chance of flaws/cracks detection by non-destructive inspection, applied intermittently or continuously in a structural health monitoring (SHM) system. he technique of construction of nonparametric confidence intervals on POD vs. crack size rule, by simulated bootstrap re-sampling is presented, in view of setting, presumably safe initial crack size used in fracture mechanics computations. By merging PFM and QNDI via POD, the benefit of applying non-destructive inspection for the purpose of increasing structural reliability is estimated in terms of the decrease of failure probability. The influence of the quality of non-destructive inspection is reflected by POD rule (model). The quantitative approach, structured as a computer code pvRISK is provided. A case study of failure risk assessment in PVs is presented and discussed in the context of failure risk management by <b>intermittent</b> <b>inspection</b> or by a SHM system. By sensitivity analysis, as concerns the variability of size of cracks that might subsist in the structure the benefit of applying NDI expressed in terms of reducing the probability of failure by fracture is evaluated...|$|E
