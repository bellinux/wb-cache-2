5|$|At 02:30 on 1 May, a C-47 of 317 Tactical Control Squadron USAAF {{departed}} for Rangoon carrying a twenty-man pathfinder team, {{followed by a}} CCG plane carrying a pair of VCP, to mark and defend the landing zone at Tawhai. The rest of the composite battalion boarded thirty-eight Dakotas and took off thirty minutes later, and at 05:45 jumped over the drop zone; {{there were only a}} few casualties, one being a medical officer attached to the battalion. It encountered no Japanese opposition, and after it had rallied, advanced towards Elephant Point and the artillery battery. It halted 3,000 yards in front of the battery to allow B-24 Liberators from the USAAF to carry out a preliminary bombing attack on the battery. Unfortunately, despite officers and other ranks wearing yellow recognition panels and carrying orange umbrellas to identify themselves, C Company was bombed and strafed by the bombers, causing a number of casualties. As a result, a <b>Forward</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Controller</b> attached to the battalion ordered a halt to all further bombing runs on the battery.|$|E
5|$|On 16February 1944, the {{day after}} the {{contentious}} destruction of Monte Cassino, Eaton took No.3 Squadron through a break in the bad weather to attack the ruined monastery, the only one of No.239 Wing's units to successfully bomb its target that day. He handed over command of No.3 Squadron later that month, and was transferred to No.1 Mobile Operations Room Unit as <b>forward</b> <b>air</b> <b>controller</b> for the final assault on Monte Cassino. The run of luck that Eaton experienced in his first weeks of air combat in Tunisia continued on the ground in Italy. He survived three months of constant artillery fire, including an occasion when a shell exploded directly above his observation post, striking down a British officer standing next to him. He also came under machine-gun fire when he took a wrong turn one day and drove into the German lines, but again escaped unhurt. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 7April, in recognition of his leadership of No.3 Squadron in North Africa, Malta, Sicily and Italy.|$|E
5|$|Late in {{the morning}} of November 22, 1952, Loring led a flight of four F-80s on patrol over Kunwha. Upon radioing a <b>forward</b> <b>air</b> <b>controller,</b> he was told a T-6 Texan flying over Sniper Ridge had spotted a {{concentration}} of artillery near the ridge which was pinning down UN ground troops on the ridge. He was also told the artillery concentration was surrounded by a heavy presence of anti-aircraft guns. Loring ordered the flight to the location, spotting the artillery concentration. Immediately after Loring began his dive bombing run, he was spotted by the anti-aircraft batteries. The Chinese crews operating them were highly skilled, and even at a distance, the batteries fired an extremely accurate barrage which struck Loring's aircraft several times on the nose and fuselage. The fire disabled the aircraft. His wingmen, noting the damage, suggested he abort the bombing mission, as the flight was not far behind the lines and Loring's aircraft could have attempted the return trip. Instead, Loring ceased radio contact, and resumed {{what appeared to be the}} standard bombing mission. At , however, Loring accelerated his aircraft at a 40-degree angle in what appeared to be a controlled maneuver, lining up the Chinese batteries. The other pilots reported they watched, stunned, as Loring dove his damaged aircraft into the battery position. Loring was killed instantly in the impact, but his action resulted in the complete destruction of the battery position.|$|E

25|$|The Mosquitoes were disbanded in 1956, as {{they were}} {{considered}} a wartime expedient. After their disbandment, the United States once again had no Forward Air Control capabilities.

25|$|On 9 and 10 January, the {{southern}} Royalist force {{was reinforced by}} three Thai mercenary battalions. On 12 January, a Raven <b>Forward</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Controller</b> operating beneath an overcast sky, spotted a Communist force moving south on Route 13. In {{the absence of any}} other air power, the Raven fired a marking rocket at one of a pair of PT-76 tanks; the sonic boom of the rocket frightened the Pathet Lao infantry into retreat.|$|E

25|$|While {{this was}} in progress, in early August, a Raven <b>Forward</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Controller</b> {{directed}} an air strike using a laser-guided bomb on a communist radio station {{on the outskirts of}} Khang Khai. An errant cloud misguided the bomb; it struck the Chinese cultural mission. The resulting explosion of stored munitions leveled everything within a quarter mile, including the broadcast equipment. Much to the U.S. State Department's surprise, there was no subsequent complaint from the Chinese about the bombing.|$|E

25|$|On Kemp's return, {{even the}} MoD {{were said to}} be {{surprised}} when they reviewed the film as to how close to the action the filming had come. Kemp received praise from the Sergeant's Mess and from Prince Harry, who briefly served in Afghanistan as a <b>forward</b> <b>air</b> <b>controller.</b> It also gave some of the soldiers on the ground the chance to see how close some of the situations they were in actually are, something they don't appreciate at the time in the heat of battle.|$|E

25|$|On 17 March, as BC 610A and the 141st PAVN Regiment {{exchanged}} {{heavy weapons}} fire, five Communist T-34 tanks and four {{armored personnel carriers}} burst onto the Sam Thong airstrip. Dodging artillery fire being called in by a Raven <b>Forward</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Controller</b> overhead, the T-34's overwhelmed the Royalists' inadequate anti-tank defenses. Although {{one of the two}} T-34s that lumbered atop Royalist bunkers was destroyed by hand grenades, the other struck the battalion's command bunker. As BC 610A retreated, the Communists turned captured howitzers on Skyline Ridge despite being struck by four flights of tactical air.|$|E
25|$|Corporal Daniel 'Danny' Nield, from 'S' Company, 1st Battalion, The Rifles, {{was killed}} during combat, {{possibly}} by friendly fire, on Friday 30 January 2009. He was 31 years old.

He was operating as the <b>Forward</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Controller</b> in a Fire Support Team of 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery which was providing support to the operation.|$|E
25|$|The 833d was {{reactivated}} in December 1980 {{and assigned}} to Twelfth Air Force, replacing Tactical Training, Holloman as the headquarters for TAC units at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. The division supervised two assigned wings at Holloman. The division's subordinate units maintained proficiency in the McDonnell F-15 Eagle air superiority fighter and trained aircrews from allied countries. Its subordinate units screened recent pilot training graduates for fighter aptitude and provided academic and flight {{training in the}} tactics, techniques and operation of fighter aircraft. The wings also conducted training courses for jet currency, instructor pilot upgrade, and <b>forward</b> <b>air</b> <b>controller</b> orientation. The division also participated in numerous tactical exercises in the Middle East.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent {{rotation}} of assignments gave all the fighter-bomber squadrons CAS experience. Tactical air strikes on the communist front line positions were of minimal use; however, the training preserved CAS capability for the <b>forward</b> <b>air</b> <b>controllers</b> to direct {{in case of}} a renewed offensive by the communists. However, the ever-increasing hazard to the aerial [...] "Mosquito" [...] <b>forward</b> <b>air</b> <b>controllers</b> led to changes. On 20 July 1952, experimentation began with aerial pathfinders. Two experienced pilots would depart before the main formation to spot targets, and fly the initial strike to mark them. Re-investigation of radar bombing techniques also began.|$|R
