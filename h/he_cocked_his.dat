60|$|With this hurried adjuration, <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> blunderbuss, {{and stood}} on the offensive.|$|E
6000|$|Once more {{he spread}} his black wings and flew down to the egg. <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> {{head to one side}} and looked at it. <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> head to the other side and looked at it. He walked all around it, chuckling and saying to himself, [...] "Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty and all mine, mine, mine, mine! Pretty, pretty, and all mine!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> {{nose in the}} air loftily {{and stepped}} across the narrow field-borders with great dignity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Constable," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> hat to {{one side}} the better to scratch his bald head, [...] "there are strange people in this region." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must {{surprise}} him if we can," [...] said Curtis to Crow. [...] "We must not shoot. I {{will talk to}} him. If <b>he</b> <b>cocks</b> <b>his</b> gun kill him; but I don't think he will want to fight." ...|$|R
6000|$|He was basking {{at the top}} of {{the water}} one hot day in July, {{catching}} duns and feeding the trout, when he saw a new sort, a dark gray little fellow with a brown head. He was a very little fellow indeed: but he made the most of himself, as people ought to do. <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> up <b>his</b> head, and <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> up <b>his</b> wings, and <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> up <b>his</b> tail, and <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> up the two whisks at his tail-end, and, in short, he looked the cockiest little man of all little men. And so he proved to be; for instead of getting away, he hopped upon Tom's finger, and sat there as bold as nine tailors; and he cried out in the tiniest, shrillest, squeakiest little voice you ever heard, ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> head, and eyed me aslant, the {{suspicion}} {{in his eyes}} confirming {{the existence of the}} mystery I scented.|$|E
6000|$|... "More likely buffaloes," [...] whispered Harold, as <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> {{rifle and}} {{advanced}} quickly with Kambira, who carried a short spear or javelin.|$|E
60|$|Mr. May {{looked down}} in the mouth. <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> blue eyes at her, miserable and frightened. Failure began to frighten him abjectly.|$|E
6000|$|Ovid's eyes {{followed}} her compassionately. [...] "Poor wretch!" [...] he thought. [...] "What an infernal temper, {{and how hard}} she tries to control it!" [...] He joined Carmina, with a new delight in being near her again. Zo was still in ecstasies over the Piping Crow. [...] "Oh, the jolly little chap! Look how <b>he</b> <b>cocks</b> <b>his</b> head! <b>He</b> mocks me when I whistle. Buy him," [...] cried Zo, tugging at Ovid's coat tails in the excitement that possessed her; [...] "buy him, and let me take him home with me!" ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{he gets to}} Houston, Cohen is cornered on {{the highway}} {{by the police and}} {{considers}} shooting Travis, but the boy lets him know that he can't do it and they both know it. Cohen collides with a roadblock in his last attempt to escape. When the car breaks down, he is totally surrounded. Holding Travis close to him, <b>he</b> <b>cocks</b> <b>his</b> gun, and asks him: [...] "How old are you, kid"? Travis answers [...] "nine". While looking up, Cohen says: [...] "Nine, huh? How about that?" [...] and shoots himself through the throat, dying instantly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will put}} my hand in the fire for Mr. Balfour," [...] says Alan. [...] "He is an honest and a mettle gentleman, and I would have ye bear in mind who says it. I bear a king's name," [...] says <b>he,</b> <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> hat; [...] "and I and any that I call friend are company for the best. But the gentleman is tired, and should sleep; if he has no mind to the cartes, it will never hinder you and me. And I'm fit and willing, sir, to play ye any game that ye can name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hallo! look there! what a monster!" [...] shouted Fred, as <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> musket and sprang forward. [...] "What'll you do, Tom, you've no gun?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{thought and}} he thought {{and he thought}} and he thought, and little by little a plan worked out in his little black head. Then he chuckled. He chuckled right out loud, then hurriedly looked {{around to see if}} any one had heard him. No one had, so he chuckled again. <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> head on one side and half closed his eyes, as if that plan was {{something}} he could see and he was looking at it very hard. Then <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> head {{on the other side and}} did the same thing.|$|E
6000|$|Hawe was spitefully {{ejecting}} a wad {{of tobacco}} from his mouth and swearing in an undertone about [...] "white-livered Greasers." [...] <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> red eye speculatively at Stewart.|$|E
60|$|By {{that time}} it was long past noon, and the hunter was meditating the propriety of going to a {{neighbouring}} height to view the surrounding country, when a slight noise attracted <b>his</b> attention. <b>He</b> started, <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> gun, glared round in all directions, and held his breath.|$|R
60|$|Then Wang heard, {{much more}} faint, a voice {{he had never}} heard before--a novel {{impression}} which <b>he</b> acknowledged by <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> head slightly to one side.|$|R
50|$|Tum {{decides to}} get rid of their bodies, get a plane ticket, obtain a fake {{passport}} and visa, take the noodle box with her and go spend {{the rest of her life}} somewhere else. But the gangster, Kanjit, who makes fake passports happens to be the very guy she must stay away from. More men sent by a Muay Thai promoter appears at Tum's apartment, where one quickly hid in her wardrobe when she returned home. A young policeman, who is the lover of her nosy neighbor, Pen, suddenly calls on her and discovers the bodies. The hidden man attracts the policeman's attention when <b>he</b> <b>cocks</b> <b>his</b> gun, and the subsequent firefight kills them both.|$|R
60|$|My friend {{threw out}} the {{information}} in a very offhand way, but I saw that <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> eye at me to see if I had followed his reasoning.|$|E
60|$|The latter {{regarded}} him wistfully, started away, then returned and whined softly. The master {{talked to him}} gently but seriously, and <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> ears, and listened with painful intentness.|$|E
60|$|To {{this the}} Beggar listened with his {{knuckles}} resting against his hips, and when Robin had ended <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> head {{on one side}} and thrust his tongue into his cheek.|$|E
5000|$|A. O. Scott, in {{his review}} for The New York Times, had {{problems}} with Phoenix's performance: [...] "Even though his singing voice doesn't match the original - how could it? - he is most convincing in concert, when his shoulders tighten and <b>he</b> <b>cocks</b> <b>his</b> head to one side. Otherwise, he seems stuck {{in the kind of}} off-the-rack psychological straitjacket in which Hollywood likes to confine troubled geniuses". In his review for Time, Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "A lot of credit for Phoenix's performance has to go to Mangold, who has always been good at finding the bleak melodrama in taciturn souls ... If Mangold's new movie has a problem, it's that he and co-screenwriter Gill Dennis sometimes walk the lines of the inspirational biography too rigorously".|$|R
60|$|Whether Crusoe {{thought of}} that or not we cannot say, but he looked up in his master's face as <b>he</b> spoke, <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> ears very high, and turned his head slowly to one side, until it could not turn any further in that direction; then he turned it {{as much to the}} other side, whereat his master burst into an {{uncontrollable}} fit of laughter, and Crusoe immediately began barking vociferously.|$|R
500|$|Moustache later had to {{have his}} wounded leg amputated. [...] Other rewards {{he is said to}} have {{received}} for this event include an order being issued that whichever regiment he presented himself at would have to feed him the rations of a serving soldier and that he was placed on the regimental books and was to receive the pay and rations of a soldier. [...] A further legend says that Moustache was presented to Napoleon himself and demonstrated to have performed a trick whereby <b>he</b> would <b>cock</b> <b>his</b> leg whenever France's enemies were mentioned.|$|R
60|$|That {{this threat}} {{was made by}} one of the gang from whom he was trying to escape there could be no question, and Jet darted aside quickly as <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> revolver.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{just keep}} still, will you, for one moment," [...] muttered Benjy, {{advancing}} cautiously through the outer margin of reeds, among the stems {{of which he}} peered earnestly while <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> gun.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> head, {{and looked}} at it with his right eye. Then he hopped round to the other side, {{and looked at}} it with his left eye. With either optic it seemed equally desirable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Had one {{objection}} to Moosu," [...] <b>he</b> began, <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> head meditatively--"one objection, and only one. He was an Indian from {{over on the}} edge of the Chippewyan country, but the trouble was, he'd picked up a smattering of the Scriptures. Been campmate a season with a renegade French Canadian who'd studied for the church. Moosu'd never seen applied Christianity, and his head was crammed with miracles, battles, and dispensations, and what not he didn't understand. Otherwise he was a good sort, and a handy man on trail or over a fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "'What did {{you have}} to do with it?' <b>he</b> asked, <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> head in what I always thought a most impudent manner. Do you know, he puts on more airs and graces than a peacock, simply because he's the only bird that has a red vest to go with a brown coat? Of course I told him the whole story, though there wasn't any need for me to say that I'd been frightened nearly out of my wits, and before I'd {{finished}} Mr. Crow called the meeting to order.|$|R
60|$|He rose dizzily to his feet. The whole action {{had passed}} {{in a few}} seconds of time, and had not even been noticed by the sole {{occupant}} of the coach. <b>He</b> mechanically <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> revolver, but the man beneath him never moved again. Neither was there any sign of flight or reinforcement from the thicket around him. Again the whole truth flashed upon him. This spy and traitor had been left behind by the marauders to return to the station and avert suspicion; he had been lurking around, but being without firearms, had not dared to attack the pair together.|$|R
6000|$|Late that {{afternoon}} he came hurrying back, and Granny knew {{by the way}} that <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> ears and carried his tail that he had news of some kind. [...] "Well, what is it?" [...] she demanded.|$|E
6000|$|... "On occasion, sir; on occasion!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> eye {{at me as}} if {{to gauge}} whether I were worthy of his confidence. [...] "The fact is, sir, that my wife is coming back to me to day." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{he broke}} free: while all things ceased, Some hour increasing, he increased. The town beneath him seemed a map, Above the church <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> cap, Above the cross his feather flew Above {{the birds and}} still he grew.|$|E
60|$|He {{had just}} reached the wood {{on the other}} side, and turned to wait for his comrade, when he heard two shots in quick succession. There was nothing unusual in this, but {{when he heard the}} Philosopher utter a loud cry, <b>he</b> started, <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> gun, and ran a few steps back to meet him. Next moment Jack burst from the thicket and ran across the plain at a speed that told of {{imminent}} danger. From the same thicket there also rushed a large grizzly bear, whose speed was greater than that of Jack, though it {{did not appear to be}} so.|$|R
6000|$|At that moment, as if a wish {{had brought}} him, a veritable John Hancock stood before them, looking comelier than ever, in a velvet suit, as <b>he</b> laid <b>his</b> <b>cocked</b> hat upon <b>his</b> heart and asked, {{with a bow}} so deep that it afforded a fine view of the garnet buckle in his stock,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Be {{it as it}} may, it {{is certain}} that the attitude, eye, voice, manner, of the speaker for a moment struck the party below to silence. There is {{something}} in boldness and determination that for a time hushes even the rudest nature. Marks {{was the only one who}} remained wholly untouched. <b>He</b> was deliberately <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> pistol, and, in the momentary silence that followed George's speech, he fired at him.|$|R
