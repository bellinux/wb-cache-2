5000|$|Although this ADC {{concept has}} been {{extremely}} successful, especially for clinical applications, it has been challenged recently, as new, more comprehensive models of diffusion in biological tissues have been introduced. Those models have been made necessary, as diffusion in tissues is not free. In this condition, the ADC seems {{to depend on the}} choice of b values (the ADC seems to decrease when using larger b values), as the plot of ln(S/So) is not linear with the b factor, as expected from the above equations. This deviation from a free diffusion behavior is what makes diffusion MRI so successful, as the ADC is very sensitive to changes in tissue microstructure. On the other hand, modeling diffusion in tissues is becoming very complex. Among most popular models are the biexponential model, which assumes the presence of 2 water pools in slow or <b>intermediate</b> <b>exchange</b> [...] and the cumulant-expansion (also called Kurtosis) model which does not necessarily require the presence of 2 pools.|$|E

We find that the significant variables are those representing the growth rate, the evolution of domestic credit, the interest rate, the duration of the initial exchange rate regime and the incidence of exits over the years preceding and following the year during which the exit episode under consideration takes place. These results point strongly towards possible contagion and duration-dependence effects, but also to a strong influence of certain economic fundamentals...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecently, mass {{spectrometry}} {{has been applied}} to studies of hydrogen exchange of backbone amides, allowing analysis of large proteins at physiological concentrations. Low resolution spatial information is obtained by digesting proteins after exchange into D 2 O, using electrospray ionization liquid chromatography/{{mass spectrometry}} (ESI-LC/MS) to measure deuteration by mass increases of resulting peptides. This study develops modeling paradigms to increase resolution, using the signal transduction kinase ERK 2 as a prototype for larger, less stable proteins. In-exchange data for peptides were analyzed by nonlinear least squares and a maximum entropy method, distinguishing amides into fast, intermediate, slow, and nonexchanging classes. Analysis of completely nonexchanging or in-exchanging peptides and peptides with sequence overlaps showed that nonexchanging amides were generally hydrogen bonded and sterically constrained or buried ≥ 2. 2 Å from the protein surface, while fast exchanging hydrogens were generally exposed at the protein surface. In order to more fully understand the <b>intermediate</b> and slow <b>exchanging</b> classes, an empirical model was developed by analyzing published exchange rates in cytochrome c. The model correlated protection factors with a combined dependency on surface accessibility, hydrogen bond length, and position of residues from alpha helix ends. Together with analysis of partial proteolytic products, the derived rules for exchange allowed modeling of exchange behavior of peptides. Substantial deviation from the predicted rates in some cases suggested a role for conformational freedom in regulating fast and <b>intermediate</b> <b>exchanging</b> amides...|$|R

In {{the case of a}} monopolistic intermediary the tradeoff between the bid-ask spread and the costs of delay during private search determine the intermediary's clientele. In equilibrium the monopolist charges a positive spread. Traders with large gains from trade prefer to deal with him, whereas traders with relatively low gains from trade engage in search. In case of competition among intermediaries the classical Bertrand result obtains and bid and ask prices converge to the (unique) Walrasian equilibrium price. Thus in the confines of the model the Walrasian auctioneer of the market under consideration can be replaced by competing intermediaries.

40|$|During the 90 s {{emerging}} markets {{have been hit}} by recurrent exchange rate crises. Almost all these countries shared a common characteristic: they adopted in previous years soft pegs, the so-called <b>intermediate</b> <b>exchange</b> rate regimes. International institutions and academic economists interpreted this intrinsic fragility of soft pegs {{as a consequence of}} the increasing international capital mobility. From this perspective, the exchange-rate regime is seen as constrained by the monetary policy trilemma, which imposes a stark trade-off among exchange stability, monetary independence, and capital market openness. Soft pegs seem incompatible with international financial integration. As a result, a new consensus appeared: the choice of domestic authorities is limited to corner solutions: hard pegs on the one side; independent floating on the other side. This paper proposes a contribution to the analysis of exchange rate regimes choice by {{emerging markets}}.
