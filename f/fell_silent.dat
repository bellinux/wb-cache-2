5|$|So loud was {{the cheering}} that {{followed}} this address that the proas <b>fell</b> <b>silent,</b> the Dayaks apparently unnerved. In the morning however the 20 canoes were still offshore and, with the anticipated rescue overdue and supplies running low, a desperate plan {{was made to}} use the ship's boats to board and capture enough Dayak vessels to enable the entire crew to reach Batavia. However, while these plans were being formed the British East India Company's (EIC) armed brig Ternate appeared on the southern horizon.|$|E
5|$|Watney {{takes the}} rover to {{retrieve}} the nearby Pathfinder probe, which <b>fell</b> <b>silent</b> in 1997. Using the lander's camera, he establishes rudimentary communication with Earth, first with plastic bin lids, and then using hexadecimals. NASA instructs Watney to partially modify the rover's code to link with Pathfinder so they can communicate via text. Watney becomes angry when he learns that the crew has not been told of his survival (and openly expresses it), and Sanders reluctantly lets Henderson finally inform them.|$|E
5|$|Ezarik {{posted a}} video {{about wanting to}} order a cheeseburger on YouTube. It got 600,000 views in its first week. Ezarik has come to view iJustine as a character. As a result, she does not curse or drink on any videos she releases. By January 2009 she reduced her lifecasting {{a few hours a}} week, and by April 2009 her lifecast channel <b>fell</b> <b>silent.</b> When Ezarik first moved to Los Angeles, she was managed by Richard Frias, who also manages YouTube celebrities HappySlip and KevJumba, but {{according}} to a post on Ezarik's alternate Twitter account, she was unmanaged and earned money by appearing at conferences and in online promotional spots. At the time, she believed that her fanbase was predominately between the ages of 11 and 18.|$|E

50|$|WKXM (1300 AM) was an American {{radio station}} {{licensed}} {{to serve the}} community of Winfield, Alabama. The station, established in 1965, was last owned by Ad-Media Management Corp. The station <b>fell</b> permanently <b>silent</b> on August 2, 2012.|$|R
60|$|The crowd, {{which had}} hooted and insulted {{him from the}} Conciergerie to the Place de Greve, <b>fell</b> {{suddenly}} <b>silent</b> as he mounted the scaffold, his step firm, but his shoulders bowed, and his eyes upon the ground.|$|R
5|$|The Germans placed {{candles on}} their {{trenches}} and on Christmas trees, then continued the celebration by singing Christmas carols. The British responded by singing carols of their own. The two sides continued by shouting Christmas greetings to each other. Soon thereafter, there were excursions across No Man's Land, where small gifts were exchanged, such as food, tobacco and alcohol, and souvenirs such as buttons and hats. The artillery {{in the region}} <b>fell</b> <b>silent.</b> The truce also allowed a breathing spell where recently killed soldiers could be brought back behind their lines by burial parties. Joint services were held. In many sectors, the truce lasted through Christmas night, continuing until New Year's Day in others.|$|E
5|$|Within {{hours of}} the first shots from the Royal Battery, the French {{defenses}} opposite <b>fell</b> <b>silent,</b> the only return fire coming from more distant flanking batteries. British fire intensified at noon when a battery of mortars opened a bombardment, and at 16:30 flags of truce were raised over the city's bastions. Clermont's offer requested a 24-hour ceasefire to negotiate terms, but Braithwaite allowed only until 08:00 the following morning, during which time the construction of British earthworks would continue. Clermont, isolated and unsupported, accepted the terms, and the following morning Braithwaite's army entered the city and took possession, although the French garrison had seized liquor supplies during the night and were too drunk to surrender formally.|$|E
5|$|By seven-thirty, {{the town}} was firmly {{in the hands of}} Major-General Hunter's force. Almost the {{entirety}} of the Mahdist garrison, excepting the cavalry, had been slain in desperate combats throughout the settlement. However, a few isolated pockets of Mahdist resistance remained in fortified houses, violently refusing to give up the fight. Six men sent to capture a Mahdist sniper's position in a small house near the river were each killed, forcing Hunter to invoke his artillery. The building was shelled to ruins, but the sniper survived, evidenced by the shooting of another soldier sent to locate his body. Finally, a second barrage of artillery blasted what remained of the structure and the rubble <b>fell</b> <b>silent,</b> though the sniper's body was never found. The local inhabitants had armed themselves with clubs and spears to defend themselves during the battle, but played little role in its outcome.|$|E
25|$|At {{first the}} crowd <b>fell</b> deathly <b>silent,</b> unable to fathom how England had {{collapsed}} so dramatically. Then as the fine bowling display sank in, they rushed {{onto the field}} to congratulate Spofforth and Boyle for their remarkable achievement.|$|R
6000|$|... [Illustration: The captain <b>fell</b> back <b>silent,</b> and Mr. Tasker, pausing in {{a respectful}} attitude, watched him wistfully.

5|$|The heavy Ottoman fire forced Canopus and Swiftsure to {{withdraw}} from their bombardment position, though this placed them in range of the guns at Erenköy as well, while those at Dardanus could still engage them. Cornwallis, having silenced the guns at Intepe, started shelling Erenköy, while Canopus and Swiftsure kept their fire on Dardanus. The Ottomans repeatedly straddled the three battleships, but being further out in the strait, they had more room to manoeuvre and so avoided any direct hits. By 16:40, the guns at Dardanus <b>fell</b> <b>silent,</b> allowing all three ships to concentrate their fire at Erenköy, where the batteries were quickly neutralised. The three ships then withdrew, seemingly having achieved their objective, though that night, when destroyers and minesweepers tried to clear the minefields blocking the straits, they were met with very heavy fire and were forced {{to withdraw}}. During the third landings on 4 March 1915, she demonstrated off the Aegean coast to keep Ottoman ground forces tied down.|$|E
25|$|That evening Avon {{encountered}} the United States Navy ship-rigged sloop of war Wasp in the English Channel. Wasp spotted Avons sail {{on the horizon}} and gave chase. By 9:30pm, Wasp had Avon under her lee bow and opened fire. Avon returned fire until 10pm, at which time her guns, according to the crew of Wasp, <b>fell</b> <b>silent.</b> Wasp then ceased fire and called for Avon to surrender, but Avon answered with another cannonade. Wasp returned fire. Some broadsides later, Avon's guns <b>fell</b> <b>silent</b> once more and Wasp again called for surrender. Avon, by now a battered hulk, {{had no choice but}} to concede.|$|E
25|$|During {{the third}} lap of the 2011 Daytona 500 (a decade since Earnhardt's death), the {{commentators}} on FOX <b>fell</b> <b>silent</b> while fans raised three fingers {{in a similar}} fashion to the tributes throughout 2001.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from some}} low-key {{appearances}} on beneath-the-radar compilations, EIS <b>fell</b> largely <b>silent</b> while Astor and Sheppard attended to their other projects. Astor released his Songbox solo album on Second Language in 2010 while Sheppard released an album, {{under the name}} Snow Palms, in conjunction with producer Chris Leary, in 2012.|$|R
6000|$|He went {{on walking}} up and down. His voice rose, <b>fell,</b> was <b>silent</b> a moment, and then talked on. He moved his hands, {{sometimes}} he waved his arms. Anne looked and listened quietly, {{as though she were}} at a lecture. He was a nice boy, and to-day he looked charming--charming! ...|$|R

25|$|During her {{childhood}} {{it was thought}} that the alleged unmarried affair with Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson must be kept secret. Even Anders Underdal, who early on gave an account of his origin to his children, <b>fell</b> <b>silent</b> about that matter later in life. Nobody knows why. Sandemo herself doesn't like talking about her ancestry in public.|$|E
25|$|At 5 a.m. on March 6, the Mexican troops {{launched}} their final {{assault on the}} Alamo. The guns <b>fell</b> <b>silent</b> 90 minutes later; the Alamo had fallen. Survivors Susannah Dickinson, her daughter Angelina, Travis' slave Joe, and Almonte's cook Ben were spared by Santa Anna and sent to Gonzales, where Texian volunteers had been assembling.|$|E
25|$|At 4:30a.m. on October 4, the Confederates {{opened up}} on the Union inner line of entrenchments with a six-gun battery, which kept up its {{bombardment}} until after sunrise. When the guns <b>fell</b> <b>silent,</b> the U.S. troops prepared themselves to resist an attack. But the attack was slow in coming. Van Dorn had directed Hébert to begin the engagement at daylight, and the artillery fire was merely preliminary to enable Hébert to get into position for the assault.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the millennium, Hart {{once again}} <b>fell</b> largely <b>silent</b> as he and Masse married and {{relocated}} to Nassau, Bahamas, to focus on raising their young family. He returned to Montreal in late 2002 for a two-night stand of concerts with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, performing songs from Corey Hart and Jade as well as older hits to the accompaniment of the MSO.|$|R
50|$|The tobacco {{warehouses}} of Lexington, however, <b>fell</b> mostly <b>silent</b> during World War II. Labor shortages {{translated into}} {{a sharp drop in}} tobacco production, and many warehouses in urban areas underwent transformation into storage for war supplies. E.J. O'Brien and Company, which had are-drying and re-handling facility and a hogshead tobacco warehouse at the corner of South Broadway and Virginia Avenue, underwent a conversion to manufacturing parachutes during World War II.|$|R
60|$|But Duane cut him short with {{a fierce}} gesture. He lunged {{up to his}} feet, and the rangers <b>fell</b> back. Dark, <b>silent,</b> grim as he had been, still there was a {{transformation}} singularly more sinister, stranger.|$|R
25|$|On December 4, 2003, {{new owners}} Great South RFDC LLC cited ongoing {{technical}} {{issues related to}} new broadcast tower construction and requested {{an extension of the}} previous authority to remain silent. The extension was granted on December 11, 2003, with a caution that the station's license was subject to forfeiture if they did not resume broadcast operations by May 8, 2004—one year after the station <b>fell</b> <b>silent.</b> With another application pending and a new tower array under construction, the new owners had the FCC change the station's call letters to WSMO on May 25, 2004.|$|E
25|$|Some {{time after}} the war, pacifists found an {{alternative}} interpretation of the white feather {{as a symbol of}} peace. The apocryphal story goes that in 1775, Quakers in a Friends meeting house in Easton, New York were faced by a tribe of Indians on the war path. Rather than flee, the Quakers <b>fell</b> <b>silent</b> and waited. The Indian chief came into the meeting house and finding no weapons he declared the Quakers as friends. On leaving he took a white feather from his quiver and attached it to the door as a sign to leave the building unharmed.|$|E
25|$|Andy Wilkins, James McCann, and Brett Eibner {{all went}} deep in game {{one of a}} three game series against the Troy Trojans. Zack Cox was 2–2 with one RBI and two runs scored as the Razorbacks prevailed 10–1. Wilkins, Eibner, and Cox would hit home runs in game two, as the No.16 Diamond Hogs took a 10–8 slugfest. Redshirt sophomore Drew Smyly started the game, Jeremy Heatley earned the win, and DJ Baxendale, the Arkansas Gatorade Player of the Year {{as a high school}} senior, earned his first career save. The Razorbacks started game three with seven runs in the first two innings, but then the bats <b>fell</b> <b>silent.</b> Troy posted six runs, but the Trojans couldn't {{complete}} the comeback and lost 7–6.|$|E
60|$|Her {{husband and}} Ridgeley entered into {{conversation}} with those sitting near. Ridgeley seemed {{on good terms}} with them all, and ventured a joke or word, at which they laughed with terrific energy, and <b>fell</b> as suddenly <b>silent</b> again.|$|R

5000|$|WJBE <b>fell</b> {{temporarily}} <b>silent</b> on January 10, 2014, {{for technical}} reasons. In their January 15, 2014, filing with the FCC, the station asserted [...] "technical {{problems with the}} audio end of the transmitter" [...] requiring that the transmitter be [...] "sent back to the factory for repairs" [...] and requested special temporary authority to remain silent until the transmitter can be repaired and reinstalled. WJBE is still listed with the FCC as [...] "silent" [...] (out of business) on the FCC listing of defunct FM broadcast stations.|$|R
25|$|As {{the guns}} <b>fell</b> <b>silent</b> at dusk in Navarino Bay, {{news of the}} outcome raced over the Peloponnese and {{to the rest of}} Greece. In village after village, church bells started a {{continuous}} peal in the night. People rushed into village squares, to be greeted by the news that the Ottoman Sultan and his hated vassal Ibrahim Pasha no longer possessed a Mediterranean fleet. In a maritime country like Greece, the implication was evident, that the fledgling Greek state was saved. Wild rejoicing broke out, and lasted through the night and for days after. Huge bonfires were lit on the mountaintops of the Peloponnese and Mt Parnassos in central Greece. Celebrations swept even the occupied regions, which the demoralised Ottoman garrisons made little effort to prevent.|$|E
25|$|While reports {{taken from}} German prisoners {{speak of the}} terror they {{experienced}} from the bombardment, {{there is no evidence}} that naval gun fire caused great destruction to the German guns. As a result of the non-destruction of the guns, infantry had to be used to capture them. Nevertheless, the naval gunfire was effective in neutralizing the German batteries, disabling 22 of their 24 assigned targets, and during the bombardment there were long periods during which German gun positions <b>fell</b> <b>silent.</b> This was later attributed to the demoralizing effect that they had on the German gunners, rather than a destructive effect on the guns. The fire support provided by the task force's small ships proved to be more effective, and according to Allied reports after the bombardment this was the most effective aspect of the bombardment.|$|E
25|$|For the {{remainder}} of April, the Confederates, now at 57,000 and under the direct command of Johnston, improved their defenses while McClellan undertook the laborious process of transporting and placing massive siege artillery batteries, which he planned to deploy on May 5. Johnston knew that the impending bombardment {{would be difficult to}} withstand, so began sending his supply wagons in the direction of Richmond on May 3. Escaped slaves reported that fact to McClellan, who refused to believe them. He was convinced that an army whose strength he estimated as high as 120,000 would stay and fight. On the evening of May 3, the Confederates launched a brief bombardment of their own and then <b>fell</b> <b>silent.</b> Early the next morning, Heintzelman ascended in an observation balloon and found that the Confederate earthworks were empty.|$|E
50|$|However, in the early-1990s, {{the station}} {{began to have}} much more serious problems, as two oldies-formatted FM {{stations}} began to dominate the landscape. WJPA in Washington, Pennsylvania, switched to oldies and embarked on an aggressive marketing campaign to attract new listeners. A new adult contemporary FM station, WWYS, had been launched in Cadiz, Ohio, at 106.3 back in 1990. It too switched to oldies and now with the FM competition, WDIG found itself fighting for its survival, but the fight proved futile, as the station <b>fell</b> briefly <b>silent.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Howkan understood, and Imber's eyes flashed, {{for he had}} {{witnessed}} the play between his sister's son {{and the man in}} authority. And then began the story, the epic of a bronze patriot which might well itself be wrought into bronze for the generations unborn. The crowd <b>fell</b> strangely <b>silent,</b> and the square-browed judge leaned head on hand and pondered his soul and the soul of his race. Only was heard the deep tones of Imber, rhythmically alternating with the shrill voice of the interpreter, and now and again, like the bell of the Lord, the wondering and meditative [...] "Hell" [...] of the red-haired man.|$|R
60|$|Came negro water-carriers {{in white}} turbans with aspersers made of {{palmetto}} leaves to sprinkle {{the ground and}} lay the dust against the tramp of slaves and buyers. The trumpets ceased for an instant, then wound a fresh imperious blast and <b>fell</b> permanently <b>silent.</b> The crowd about the gates fell back to right and left, and very slowly and stately three tall dalals, dressed {{from head to foot}} in white and with immaculate turbans wound about their heads, advanced into the open space. They came to a halt at the western end of the long wall, the chief dalal standing slightly in advance of the other two.|$|R
