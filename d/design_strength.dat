2500|$|On April 5, 2006, {{months after}} {{independent}} investigators had {{demonstrated that the}} levee failures were not due to natural forces beyond intended <b>design</b> <b>strength,</b> Lt. Gen. Carl Strock testified before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water that, [...] "We have now concluded we had problems with {{the design of the}} structure." [...] He also testified that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not know of this mechanism of failure prior to August 29, 2005. The claim of ignorance is refuted by the National Science Foundation investigators hired by the Army Corps of Engineers, who point to a 1986 study (E-99 study) by the corps itself that such separations were possible in the I-wall design. This issue is addressed again in a study released in August 2015 by J. David Rogers et al. who concluded that a misinterpretation of the 1986 study occurred apparently because the Corps had draped a tarpaulin over the gap that formed between the bases of the deflecting sheet piles and the soil in which they were embedded, so they did not see the gap. The tarpaulin was there for safety and to stop water that would seep through the interlocks. Failure to include the gap in interpretation of the test results introduced unconservatism in the final designs based on these tests. It allowed the use of shorter sheet piles, and reduced overall flood protection reliability.|$|E

40|$|A {{test program}} was {{performed}} on aluminum alloy columns of square and rectangular hollow sections that were compressed between fixed ends. In total, five series of tests were conducted that included columns with both ends transversely welded to aluminum end plates using the {{tungsten inert gas welding}} method, and columns without welding of end plates. The tests were performed over a range of column lengths in order to obtain a column curve for each series of test. Heat-treated aluminum alloys of 6063 -T 5 and 6061 -T 6 material were used for the column specimens. Nonwelded and welded material properties were obtained from various coupon tests. The column specimens failed by local buckling, overall buckling, as well as interaction of local and overall buckling. In addition, some welded columns failed in the heat-affected zone. The test strengths were compared with the <b>design</b> <b>strengths</b> predicted by the American, Australian/New Zealand, and European specifications for aluminum structures. Reliability of the design rules for transversely welded aluminum columns in the three specifications was examined using reliability analysis. It is shown that the <b>design</b> <b>strengths</b> predicted by the three specifications are conservative for the nonwelded columns.

The tubular X-joint specimens were tested without chord preload as well as with three different levels of preload applied to the chord members. The test specimens were fabricated from square and rectangular hollow sections as brace and chord members. A total of 32 tests was performed. High strength stainless steel (duplex and high strength austenitic) and normal strength stainless steel (AISI 304) specimens were tested. The test results were compared with the <b>design</b> <b>strengths</b> obtained using the CIDECT Guide and Eurocode for carbon steel structures.

40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} investigations on cold-formed stainless steel tubular sections subjected to web crippling {{performed by the}} authors are summarized in this paper. The web crippling test results of cold-formed stainless steel tubular sections subjected to four loading conditions specified in the American and the Australian/New Zealand specifications are presented in this paper. Moreover, web crippling tests conducted under end and interior loading conditions to simulate a floor joist member seated on a solid foundation subjected to a concentrated load are also reported, and these loading conditions are not currently specified in the specifications. All of these test results are compared with the <b>design</b> <b>strengths</b> obtained using the American, the Australian/New Zealand and the European specifications fo cold-formed stainless steel members {{as well as the}} North American specification for oldformed carbon steel structural members. It is shown that the <b>design</b> <b>strengths</b> predicted by these specifications are either unconservative or very conservative for high strength stainless steel tubular sections.

40|$|A {{series of}} tests on cold-formed unlipped {{channels}} with comparatively stocky webs and subjected to web crippling is presented in this paper. The web slenderness values of the channels ranged from 15. 3 to 45. The tests were conducted under the four loading conditions (End-One-Flange, Interior-One-Flange, End-Two-Flange, and Interior-Two-Flange) specified in the Australian/New Zealand and American specifications for cold-formed steel structures. The test strengths are compared with the <b>design</b> <b>strengths</b> obtained using the specifications. It is demonstrated that the <b>design</b> <b>strengths</b> predicted by the specifications are generally unconservative for unlipped channels. Test strengths as low as 43 % of the <b>design</b> <b>strengths</b> were obtained. Hence, new web crippling design equations for unlipped channels are proposed in this paper. The proposed design equations are derived based on a simple plastic mechanism model, and the web crippling strength is obtained by dispersing the bearing load through the web.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation of cold-formed steel channels with complex stiffeners subjected to pure axial compression for fixed-ended columns. The complex stiffeners {{of the channel}} sections consist of simple lips with return lips. A total of 30 column specimens were tested. The specimens were brake pressed from high strength zinc-coated structural steel sheets. Four different cross sections with different flange slenderness were tested over a range of column lengths. Detailed measurements of material properties, geometric imperfections, and local buckling loads of the specimens were conducted. Interaction of local and overall buckling was observed in the tests. Failure modes include local buckling, distortional buckling, and flexural-torsional buckling. The test strengths of the columns are compared with the <b>design</b> <b>strengths</b> predicted by the American Specification and the Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures.

It is shown that the <b>design</b> <b>strengths</b> predicted by the American Specification are generally unconservative for short and intermediate columns, whereas the <b>design</b> <b>strengths</b> predicted by the Australian/New Zealand Standard are generally conservative for all column lengths.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} web crippling tests on cold-formed unlipped channels with flanges restrained (fastened) as well as channels with flanges unrestrained (unfastened). The tests were performed under end and interior two-flange loading conditions specified in the North American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures, namely end-two-flange and interior-two-flange loading conditions. The concentrated load was applied by a bearing plate at the top flange of the channels, and the reaction force applied by an identical bearing plate at the bottom flange of the channels. The bearing plates acted across the full flange widths of the channels. The flanges of the channels were either bolted {{to one or two}} bearing plates for the specimens with flanges restrained. The web crippling test strengths are compared with the <b>design</b> <b>strengths</b> obtained using the North American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and American Iron and Steel Institute Specification for cold-formed steel structures.

The results obtained from the finite element analysis were verified against experimental results. An extensive parametric {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effects of different concrete strengths and cross-section geometries on the strength and behaviour of concrete-filled SHS and RHS steel tube columns. The study was conducted over a wide range of concrete cube strengths ranged from 30 to 110 MPa.
