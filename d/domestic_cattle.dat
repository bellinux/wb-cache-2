50|$|A United States Department of Agriculture {{study found}} Beefalo meat, like bison meat, {{to be lower}} in fat and {{cholesterol}} than standard beef cattle. The American Beefalo Association states that Beefalo {{are better able to}} tolerate cold and need less assistance calving than <b>cattle,</b> while retaining <b>domestic</b> <b>cattle's</b> docile nature and fast growth rate. They damage rangeland less than cattle. They also state that Beefalo meat contains 4 to 6% more protein and is more tender, flavorful, and nutritious than a standard steer. Beefalo has significantly less calories, fat, and cholesterol, than beef cattle, chicken, and cod.|$|R
50|$|The large {{quantity}} of bones {{discovered in the}} settlements, most originating from <b>domestic</b> animals, <b>cattle,</b> sheep, swine—as well as game—indicate the importance of domestic animals to supplement hunting, {{as well as the}} importance of meat in the daily diet.|$|R
5|$|Free-roaming horses could once {{be found}} {{throughout}} much of the American frontier west of the Mississippi River, and may have numbered as many as two million around 1850. However, no comprehensive estimate of free-roaming horse numbers was done until 1971, and thus early estimates are speculative. Horse numbers were in decline as <b>domestic</b> <b>cattle</b> and sheep competed with them for resources. Ranchers shot horses to leave more grazing land for other livestock, other horses were captured off the range for human use, and some were rounded up for slaughter.|$|E
5|$|The Bovidae are the {{biological}} family of cloven-hoofed, ruminant mammals that includes bison, African buffalo, water buffalo, antelopes, sheep, goats, muskoxen, and <b>domestic</b> <b>cattle.</b> A {{member of this}} family is called a bovid. With 143 extant species and 300 known extinct species, the family Bovidae consists of eight major subfamilies apart from the disputed Peleinae and Pantholopinae. The family evolved 20 million years ago, in the early Miocene.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} diversities of bovids {{occur in}} Africa. The maximum concentration of species {{is in the}} savannas of eastern Africa. Other bovid species also occur in Europe, Asia, and North America. Bovidae includes {{three of the five}} domesticated mammals whose use has spread outside their original ranges, namely cattle, sheep, and goats. Dairy products such as milk, butter, and cheese are manufactured largely from <b>domestic</b> <b>cattle.</b> Bovids also provide leather, meat, and wool.|$|E

5|$|About 10% of Lord Howe Island's forests {{have been}} cleared for agriculture, and another 20% has been disturbed, mostly by <b>domestic</b> <b>cattle</b> and feral sheep, goats and pigs. As a result, 70% {{of the island}} remains {{relatively}} untouched {{with a variety of}} plants and animals, many of which are endemic, some of which are rare or threatened. Two species of plants, nine terrestrial birds, one bat and at least four invertebrates have become extinct since 1778. Endemism at the generic level includes the palms Howea, Hedyscepe and Lepidorrhachis, a woody daisy Lordhowea, the tree Negria, the leech Quantenobdella howensis, three annelid worm genera (Paraplutellus, Pericryptodrilus and Eastoniella), an isopod shrimp Stigmops, a hemipteran bug Howeria and a cricket Howeta.|$|E
5|$|Other than feral {{dogs and}} <b>domestic</b> <b>cattle,</b> the most {{frequently}} encountered non-human mammal is the hanuman, a long tailed grey langur prevalent in the Gangetic plain. Some wild boars and wolves may still be spotted in the small forests of Chinpai, Bandarsol and Charicha. Leopards and bears {{are not to be}} seen any more in the wild. Sometimes during the season when mahua trees bloom, wild Asiatic elephants from Jharkhand come in trampling crops and threatening life and property. Birds of Birbhum include a mix of hilly and plain-land dwelling species like partridge, pigeon, green pigeon, water fowls, doyel, Indian robin, drongo, hawk, cuckoo, koel, sunbird, Indian roller, parrot, babbler, and some migratory birds.|$|E

40|$|The {{first case}} of BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) outside Europe was {{discovered}} in Japan in September 2001. To assess its impact on Japanese retail meat demand, a Japanese meat demand system was estimated as a gradual switching Rotterdam model.

The results, {{based on data from}} April 1994 to December 2002, suggest the Japanese retail meat demand system underwent a two-month transition period following the initial BSE discovery and continued to adjust subsequently. The scare affected the demand for all types of beef. [EconLit citations: Q 11. ] © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Agribusiness 21 : 313 - 327, 2005. ...|$|R
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is preyed on by lions, leopards, African {{wild dogs}} and hyenas and predation {{is the main}} cause of death. They are also prone to outbreaks of disease which may also lead to a decline in numbers. Major human-related factors affecting populations include large-scale deforestation, the drying up of water sources, the expansion of settlements and poaching. Diseases of <b>domestic</b> <b>cattle</b> such as sleeping sickness can be transmitted to the animals and take their toll. The erection of fences that interrupt traditional migratory routes between wet and dry-season ranges have resulted in mass death events when the animals become cut off from water sources and the areas of better grazing they are seeking during droughts. A study of the factors influencing wildebeest populations in the Maasai Mara ecosystem revealed that the populations had undergone a drastic decline of around 80% from about 119,000 individuals in 1977 to around 22,000 twenty years later. The major cause of this was thought to be the expansion of agriculture, which led to the loss of wet season grazing and the traditional calving and breeding ranges. Similarly, drastic declines have recently occurred in the Tarangire wildebeest migration.|$|E

40|$|A partial DNA {{sequence}} of cytochrome b gene {{was used to}} identify the remains of endangered animals and species endemic to Taiwan. The conservation of animals species {{included in this study}} were: the formosan gem-faced civets, leopard cats, tigers, clouded leopards, lion, formosan muntjacs, formosan sika deers, formosan sambars, formosan serows, water buffalo, formosan pangolins and formosan macaques. The control species used included domestic cats, domestic dogs, <b>domestic</b> sheeps, <b>domestic</b> <b>cattles,</b> <b>domestic</b> pigs and humans. Heteroplasmy was detected in the formosan macaque, domestic pig and domestic cats. The frequencies of heteroplasmy in these animals were about 0. 25 % (1 in 402 bp). Sequences were aligned by Pileup program of GCG computer package, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method. The results of sequence comparison showed that the percentage range of sequence diversity in the same species was from 0. 25 to 2. 74 %, and that between the different species was from 5. 97 to 34. 83 %. The results of phylogenetic analysis showed that the genetic distance between the different species was from 6. 33 to 40. 59. Animals of the same species, both the endangered animal species and domestic animals, were clustered together in the neighbor-joining tree. Three unknown samples of animal remains were identified by this system. The partial {{sequence of}} cytochrome b gene adopted in this study proved to be usable for animal identification...|$|R
