500|$|In August 2010, cancer {{survivor}} Cathy Bossi, an on-duty flight attendant for U.S. Airways, was passing through security screening at Charlotte Douglas International Airport {{on the way}} to her next flight. Due to the radiation involved, she reluctantly passed through a full-body scanner. [...] "The T.S.A. Agent told me to put my I.D. on my back," [...] she said. [...] "When I got out of there the agent said because my I.D. was on my back, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a personal screening area." [...] During what she described as an [...] "aggressive" [...] pat-down search, security screening personnel forced her to remove and show her prosthetic breast. Their action violated TSA guidelines, which state that agents do not need to touch or inspect a mastectomy prosthetic.|$|E
500|$|Lundgren {{has said}} that, as a child, he was {{insecure}} and suffered from allergies, describing {{himself as a}} [...] "runt". He showed {{a keen interest in}} drumming and had aspirations to become a rock star. At age seven, he tried judo and Gōjū-ryū. He took up Kyokushin karate at the age of 10, and began lifting weights as a teenager. Lundgren stated that [...] "My dad always told me that if I wanted to make something special with my life, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> America." [...] After graduating from high school with straight As, he spent some time in the United States in the 1970s on various academic scholarships, studying chemical engineering at Washington State University and Clemson University. He studied chemical engineering for a year at Washington State University, [...] prior to serving his mandatory one year in the Swedish Marine Corps at the Amphibious Ranger School. [...] In the late 1970s, he enrolled at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and graduated with a degree in chemical engineering. The name [...] "Dolph" [...] comes from a distant relative of one of his first hamsters.|$|E
500|$|Dougan {{was sold}} on to Blackburn Rovers {{for a fee}} of £15,000 in March 1959. He scored on his Rovers debut in a 1–1 draw away to Arsenal at Highbury. He scored twice on {{the opening day of}} the 1959–60 season, a 4–0 victory over Fulham, which began a {{sequence}} of five wins and a draw from Rovers's first six matches, {{at the end of which}} the club were in second-place and Dougan tallied eleven goals, four of which came in a 6–2 victory over West Ham United. Though their league campaign petered out to an eventual 17th-place finish, Rovers reached the 1960 FA Cup Final at Wembley after Dougan scored the winning goal past Sheffield Wednesday in the semi-finals. However, he did not enjoy his time at Ewood Park, and later wrote that [...] "the dourness of the club matched that of the town. I could not shake off the depression that caused me to wake each day regretting that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the ground. Life was grey and monotonous". This led to him handing in a transfer request the day before the final, which he later admitted was an occasion where his [...] "vanity triumphed over common sense". He was not at full fitness in the final itself, and had a quiet game as Blackburn lost 3–0 to Wolverhampton Wanderers. He opened the 1960–61 season with a hat-trick in a 3–0 win over Manchester United and went on to withdraw his transfer request.|$|E

500|$|The song {{begins with}} a brief {{introduction}} in which Eminem says while the chorus plays underneath, [...] "Yeh, it's been a ride. I guess <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> that place {{to get to this}} one." [...] When he begins the first verse, his lyrics threaten people who have looked down on him: [...] "You can try to read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em/ But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em." [...] On the second verse, Eminem says that he has indeed made mistakes, commenting on his Relapse album: [...] "That last Relapse CD was ehh/ Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground/ Relax, I ain't going to do that now." [...] When he says [...] "All I'm trying to say is get back, click clack, pow", a gunshot is heard. Approaching {{the end of the second}} verse, Eminem raps about his personal experiences: [...] "But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out/ Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't/ It's time to exercise these demons/ These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now." [...] After the chorus, Eminem sings a bridge and focuses on a positive change, as he says [...] "I just can't keep living this way, so starting today I'm breaking out of this cage." [...] Before the final chorus, he says that he [...] "shoots for the moon". The song features a choir composed of Kip Blackshire, Christal Garrick II, Terry Dexter, Rich King, Kristen Ashley Cole and Sly Jordan.|$|E
500|$|Pierce married Gloria McCreadie, who he {{had dated}} since high school, on October 22, 1949, {{and they have}} three children, William Reed (born July 6, 1953), Patricia [...] "Patti" [...] Crowley (born October 4, 1955) and Robert Walter (born July 16, 1958). Pierce told one {{interviewer}} of his wife, [...] "She's not only a loyal fan, but a smart one, {{and there was the}} day <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Marty Marion – he was the White Sox manager then – and tell him that he'd better change our bunt sign because Gloria had stolen it, so very likely the opposition would be stealing it too." [...] Although he had by then been traded to the Giants, following the 1962 season they relocated from Birmingham, Michigan to the southwest Chicago suburb of Evergreen Park. (For several years while he was with the White Sox, they had also maintained a summer residence in the south side's landmark Flamingo-on-the-Lake Apartments, where teammate Jim Rivera and his family also lived.) He remained a member of the White Sox community relations department into his late 80s, making frequent public appearances in the Chicago area. In addition, beginning in 1993 he headed the not-for-profit Chicago Baseball Cancer Charities, a cause he began supporting after Nellie Fox's death in 1975 at age 47. On June 29, 2013, the White Sox gave out souvenir statuettes of Pierce to fans at that day's game against the Cleveland Indians, and he threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Pierce died in Palos Heights, Illinois on July 31, 2015 at the age of 88 from gallbladder cancer. Pierce was a 33rd Degree Mason of Evergreen Park Lodge; his funeral was held at Evergreen Park Presbyterian Church, and he was entombed in Chapel Hill Gardens South Cemetery in Alsip.|$|E

2500|$|Kelly Clarkson {{was born}} in Fort Worth, Texas, to Jeanne Ann (née Rose), a first grade English teacher, and Stephen Michael Clarkson, a former engineer. She is the {{youngest}} of three children with a brother named Jason and a sister named Alyssa. Clarkson also has two younger half brothers from her father's second marriage. Her parents divorced when she was six years old, wherein her brother went to go live with their father, her sister {{went to live with}} an aunt and she stayed with her mother. Clarkson's mother later remarried, to Jimmy Taylor. Her ancestry is Greek (from a maternal great-grandfather), Welsh, English, Irish, German, and Scottish. Her mother is a descendant of Republican state senator Isaiah Rose, whose life story was discussed on Clarkson's episode of Who Do You Think You Are?, in 2013. Clarkson was raised Southern Baptist. She has said: [...] "I always grew up in church. I was the leader of our youth group. I’ve always grown up pretty close to church and with God. But I think I’ve just gotten a lot closer just because He’s the only one I can lean on." [...] She later said of her upbringing: [...] "My family was highly conservative; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> church on Sunday and Wednesday." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brown was {{introduced}} to Harold Prince through his association with Daisy Prince, and was hired to write songs for the Broadway musical Parade, based on the trial and lynching of Leo Frank. Parade, directed by Hal Prince, and with a book by Alfred Uhry, won Brown the 1999 Tony Award for Best Original Musical Score. During this production, Livent, one of the producers of Parade, pulled out after reviews were not as positive as they'd hoped. RCA Victor, the other major producer, decided it would pull out as well. Brown said of the event in 1999, [...] "Livent dropped out shortly after the reviews came out. They announced they would not spend another dime on the show. RCA had an agreement to record all of Livent's shows. But when Livent pulled out of 'Parade,' the RCA higher-ups said they were pulling out, too. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Billy Rosenfield and ask him: 'What if we pay for this record and you just distribute it?' Billy said, 'Sure.'" [...] Brown {{had to try to}} scrounge money from every corner, [...] "In the end, RCA put in $25,000, Lincoln Center put in a big chunk, around $200,000, including the producer Scott Rudin's $25,000, and there was a contribution from the Gilman and Gonzalez-Falla foundation, which has helped support a lot of musical theatre composers over the years, of $40,000. Even Roy Furman, the new guy at Livent, gave us a little money. Somehow, we pulled it together." [...] Livent also was struggling at the time because the company had mishandled funds while allying for bankruptcy protection.|$|E
