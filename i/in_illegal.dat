5|$|Bars and {{restaurants}} are considered strictly liable for their patrons' behavior, and liquor licenses can be suspended or revoked if a customer engages <b>in</b> <b>illegal</b> activity (e.g. fighting, public urination) after drinking. New Jersey law recognizes both dram shop liability and social host liability, wherein the server of alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons or minors is liable {{if that person}} then causes death or injury to a third party in an alcohol-related automobile collision or other accident. In order to mitigate liability, the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) grants licensed establishments the right to exclude any patron for any reason, but warns business against violating civil rights laws.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, Piccadilly {{became known}} {{as a place to}} acquire heroin. Jazz trumpeter Dizzy Reece {{recalled}} people queuing outside Piccadilly's branch of Boots for heroin pills in the late 1940s. By the 1960s, the street and surrounding area were notorious as the centre of London's illegal drug trade, where heroin and cocaine could be purchased on the black market from unscrupulous chemists. By 1982, up to 20 people could be seen queueing at a chemist dealing <b>in</b> <b>illegal</b> drugs in nearby Shaftesbury Avenue.|$|E

5|$|Resistance to the German {{occupiers}} {{began in}} Belgium {{in the winter}} of 1940, after the German defeat in the Battle of Britain {{made it clear that the}} war was not lost for the Allies. Involvement <b>in</b> <b>illegal</b> resistance activity was a decision made by a minority of Belgians (approximately five percent of the population) but many more were involved in passive resistance. If captured, resistance members risked torture and execution, and around 17,000 were killed during the occupation.|$|E
5|$|The Communist Party USA was {{routinely}} harassed and {{oppressed by}} government officials, leading {{it to be}} the primary client of the ACLU. The Communists were very aggressive in their tactics, often engaging <b>in</b> <b>illegal</b> or unethical conduct, and this led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and ACLU. Communist leaders often attacked the ACLU, particularly when the ACLU defended the free speech rights of conservatives. This uneasy relationship between the two groups continued for decades.|$|E

5|$|Besides the {{buildings}} of Fort Yellowstone, the army left {{a legacy of}} policies and practices that served as precedents for the future National Park Service management of national parks. The army military commanders implemented backcountry patrols, wildlife protection and management, and protection of natural features. Army educational programs were later adopted by the National Park Service {{as part of their}} resource management. The army effectively implemented law enforcement priorities and developed a ranger force that provided for prosecution and punishment of those engaged <b>in</b> <b>illegal</b> activity in the national parks. The National Park Service carried over a version of the campaign hat worn by members of the army during the last years of their management of Yellowstone National Park for use by Park Rangers.|$|E
5|$|From {{early in}} his career, Wałęsa was {{interested}} in workers' concerns; in 1968 he encouraged shipyard colleagues to boycott official rallies that condemned recent student strikes. He was a charismatic leader, who helped organize the illegal 1970 protests at the Gdańsk Shipyard when workers protested the government's decree raising food prices and he was considered for the position of chairman of the strike committee. The strikes' outcome, which involved the deaths of over 30 workers, galvanized Wałęsa's views {{on the need for}} change. In June 1976, Wałęsa lost his job at the Gdańsk Shipyard because of his continued involvement <b>in</b> <b>illegal</b> unions, strikes, and a campaign to commemorate the victims of the 1970 protests. Afterwards he worked as an electrician for several other companies but his activism led to him continually being laid off and he was jobless for long periods. Wałęsa and his family were under constant surveillance by the Polish secret police; his home and workplace were always bugged. Over the next few years, he was arrested several times for participating in dissident activities.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{prosecutors}} began {{claiming the}} building was a national headquarters for a multimillion-dollar racketeering operation. On April 20, 1988, the FBI and Chicago police Internal Affairs Division investigators raided the On Leong Merchants Association Building, confiscated gambling paraphernalia from a casino hidden on the building's second floor and seized $350,000 from a vault. Assistant U.S. Attorney John J. Scully asserted that the Association had collected $6million <b>in</b> <b>illegal</b> gambling profits between 1966 and 1988. The building was seized by the US federal government two months later under federal racketeering statutes. Other than several first-floor shops, the building sat empty for almost five years. Rooms on the upper floors fell into disrepair, with paint peeling and faded ornamentation in pieces on the floor.|$|E

5|$|On 12 May 2006, several players, {{including}} Buffon, {{were accused}} of participating <b>in</b> <b>illegal</b> betting on Serie A matches. Buffon voluntarily co-operated, allowing himself to be interrogated by Turin magistrates. While admitting that he did place bets on sporting matches (until regulations {{went into effect in}} late 2005, banning players from doing so), he vehemently denied placing wagers on Italian football matches. Despite concerns that he had jeopardised his chance of playing for Italy in the 2006 World Cup, he was officially named Italy's starting goalkeeper on 15 May and helped Italy to win their fourth title. Buffon was cleared of all charges by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) on 27 June 2007. Following Juventus's punishment in the Calciopoli scandal, in which their two most recent Serie A titles were stripped and the squad were relegated to Serie B and penalized with a point deduction, rumours spread that Buffon would be placed on the transfer market. Buffon elected to remain with Juventus, despite the team's relegation, a decision which made him extremely popular with the Juventus fans.|$|E
5|$|On 19 June 2008, the {{municipal}} council voted to not give further subsidies to the airport. Upgrades for NOK8 million {{were needed to}} meed safety standard. The airport operator had debt of NOK12 million, and no realizeable assets. Vildanden was under certain conditions willing to pay some of the capital needed to perform the upgrades. The municipal council changed their opinion and voted—with a single decisive vote—to keep the airport running in July. The financial risk would {{be taken over by}} {{the municipal}}-owned Kontorbygg, who operate a range of offices and commercial buildings in Skien. The proposal was supported by the right-winged parties, and opposed by the socialist parties, as well as the chair of Kontorbygg. As a response, the Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries reported the municipality to ESA, and demanded that NOK20 million <b>in</b> <b>illegal</b> subsidies be repaid by Vildanden and the airport operator.|$|E
5|$|On August 27, Falcons owner Arthur Blank {{said at a}} {{press conference}} that the Falcons would seek to recover a portion of Vick's signing bonus. He said the team had no {{immediate}} plans to cut ties with Vick, citing salary-cap issues. It initially appeared that Goodell had cleared the way for the Falcons to release Vick, since he ruled that Vick's involvement in gambling activity breached his contract. On August 29, the Falcons sent a letter to Vick demanding that he reimburse them for $20 million of his $37 million bonus. The case was sent to arbitration, and on October 10, an arbitrator ruled that Vick had to reimburse the Falcons for $19.97 million. The arbitrator agreed with the Falcons' contention that Vick knew he was engaging <b>in</b> <b>illegal</b> activity when he signed his new contract in 2004, and that he had used the bonus money to pay for the operation.|$|E

5|$|Sitakunda has {{a cement}} factory, 12 jute mills, 6 textile mills, 10 {{re-rolling}} mills, and 79 functional and defunct shipyards. Two of the operational jute mills {{are run by}} the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation, and one has been sold to a private sector company. To protest against privatization, workers of Hafiz Jute Mill, Gul Ahmed Jute Mill, MM Jute Mill and RR Jute Mill blocked the Dhaka–Chittagong Highway for seven hours in September 2007. As early as 1953, Sitakunda was described as the location for one of only five poultry farms in East Pakistan, along with Tejgaon (Dhaka), Narayanganj (Dhaka), Jamalpur (Bogra), and Sylhet. Some mining for sand from agricultural lands is carried out along {{the eastern side of}} the Dhaka–Chittagong road. Operators of local brick kilns are engaged <b>in</b> <b>illegal</b> hill cutting, a practice that was responsible along with heavy rainfall for the 2007 Chittagong mudslide. The rural poor are supported by Grameen Bank and NGOs such as CARE, BRAC and ASA.|$|E
5|$|Throughout this period, but {{particularly}} {{in the middle of}} the 18th century, the Bastille was used by the police to suppress the trade <b>in</b> <b>illegal</b> and seditious books in France. In the 1750s, 40% of those sent to the Bastille were arrested for their role in manufacturing or dealing in banned material; in the 1760s, the equivalent figure was 35%. Seditious writers were also often held in the Bastille, although many of the more famous writers held in the Bastille during the period were formally imprisoned for more anti-social, rather than strictly political, offences. In particular, many of those writers detained under Louis XVI were imprisoned for their role in producing illegal pornography, rather than political critiques of the regime. The writer Laurent Angliviel de la Beaumelle, the philosopher André Morellet and the historian Jean-François Marmontel, for example, were formally detained not for their more obviously political writings, but for libellous remarks or for personal insults against leading members of Parisian society.|$|E
5|$|Despite these measures, the {{conservation}} of Ambohimanga is challenged by human and natural factors. The rapidly growing but relatively impoverished population around Ambohimanga occasionally engages <b>in</b> <b>illegal</b> harvesting of plants and trees from the surrounding forests, threatening {{the integrity of the}} natural environment. The forests and wooden structures on the site are also susceptible to fire. Following the 1995 destruction by fire of Ambohimanga's sister rova at Antananarivo, widely believed to have been a politically motivated arson, rumors have circulated that Ambohimanga could suffer a similar fate. Cyclone Giovanna, which passed over Madagascar in February 2012, caused considerable damage at the site. The wooden shingles of Andrianampoinimerina's house were torn off by the wind, exposing the historic objects inside to damage from the elements. The wooden fence surrounding the Mahandrihono compound was also badly damaged. Worst affected are the plants and trees at the site. Large swaths of endemic medicinal plants and trees in the forest were destroyed. Many of the sacred trees shading the royal city were uprooted, including sacred fig trees around the Fidasiana courtyard and inside the zebu pen. Two of the uprooted trees were of particular symbolic significance, having served as physical anchors for certain royal rituals since the 17th century. Shortly after the storm, OSCAR unveiled plans to plant a substitute fig for the uprooted one that had shaded the sacred stone in the Fidasiana courtyard. Most of the historic jacarandas planted over a century ago under French colonial rule were also destroyed. The extent of damage to the site has prompted traditionalists to demand renewed respect for the sanctity of the site by requesting adherence to traditional taboos put in place by Merina monarchs. These include banning pigs at the site, as well as the consumption of pork, tobacco, alcohol and cannabis {{on the grounds of the}} royal city.|$|E
