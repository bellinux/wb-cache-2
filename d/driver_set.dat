The resulting incident caused a brief halt to testing and Jaguar shipped a spare car for the next day's testing. Panis remained fastest on the second day. Trulli damaged his suspension and rear wing, resulting in repairs which limited his team's testing time. Burti suffered another incident when he lost his right rear wheel.

500|$|Reactions to the {{qualifying}} sessions mirrored {{those from}} two weeks before, with many commentators repeating their criticism {{over the new}} format. However, at a meeting between the FIA, Formula One Management (FOM) and the teams on race Sunday, no agreement was reached to revert to the old qualifying format, which was outright ruled out {{for the remainder of}} the season by the representatives of FIA and FOM. A new proposal was set before the teams, which would see every <b>driver</b> <b>set</b> two timed laps in every part of qualifying. Both times would than be added and the aggregate time would determine the grid positions. Reactions to the proposal were mixed. While Sebastian Vettel described it as [...] "a shit idea" [...] and Daniel Ricciardo said that he [...] "wouldn't be too keen on that", Jenson Button deemed it a better plan than the existing elimination format. On 7 April, the teams unanimously rejected the scheme, instead demanding a return to the format used between 2006 and 2015. The decision was finalised four days later.|$|E

[...] He was joined on the grid's front row by teammate Ralf Schumacher who recorded a lap 0.019 seconds slower than Montoya who displaced Schumacher from pole during the middle of qualifying. It marked {{the first time since the}} 1997 British Grand Prix that both Williams cars began a Formula One race from the first two starting positions. Häkkinen qualified third and praised the handling of his car for his good performance. Michael Schumacher secured fourth and was disappointed not to be ahead of the two McLaren cars. Coulthard started fifth having suffered from tyre bilstering and conserved his tyre use by abandoning his final qualifying run. Barrichello managed sixth having been unable to improve his time because of a spin. Behind the leading six, the two Sauber cars were seventh and eighth, Heidfeld qualifying in front of Räikkönen, with both drivers having their cars modified helping them to run faster (Heidfeld adjusted his set-up while Räikkönen raised his ride height for his third run).|$|E
