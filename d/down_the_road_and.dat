However, the pair keep driving while looking backwards. Observing that a {{railroad}} with an oncoming train is near, Alan desperately tries to signal to them to stop waving and look ahead. When they do not pay attention to him and continue waving, Alan shields his eyes as the two drive right {{into the path of}} the train and are killed. Back in the present, at the funeral, Hal enters his police car, and decides to go back on the road in order to prevent more traffic accidents from occurring.|$|E
5|$|Continuing their charge after McCausland's Brigade, the Union cavalry charged {{into the}} camp of the 16th Virginia Cavalry, which fled without resisting. Conger's 3rd West Virginia turned eastward and pursued rebels fleeing east {{down the road}} to Wardensville and Winchester. The 17th Virginia Cavalry was camped near some woods east of the main road, and had more time to prepare for the attack. They formed a battle line while three {{companies}} waited behind a fence. Initially, they repulsed Conger's men, forcing them to retreat. However, Conger was soon reinforced by Colonel Powell and the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, which was commanded by Colonel Henry Capehart. The two regiments charged the Virginians and drove them down the road or into the woods. During this time, Conger was killed by a lieutenant from the 17th Virginia. The Virginian was wearing a blue coat that fooled Conger into thinking he was from Conger's regiment. The two West Virginia regiments continued to pursue the Confederates <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>and</b> captured McCausland's two pieces of artillery. Eventually, some of the fleeing rebels ran into Major Work's 22nd Pennsylvania, and had to scatter to the woods. Work's men captured 34 of them.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of November 30, the 9th Infantry Regiment led the {{withdrawal}} by attacking the roadblock. Four tanks were first sent <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> the Chinese held their fire. Encouraged by this development, Colonel Sloane ordered the 9th Infantry Regiment to press forward, but Chinese machine gun and mortar fire immediately stopped the advance at 9 a.m. The ROK 3rd Infantry Regiment attached to the 2nd Infantry Division was sent to reinforce the US 9th Infantry Regiment, but it was routed by friendly fire. With no contacts between the American commands and the British units, the Middlesex Regiment advanced to {{the south end of}} the valley without attacking the roadblock. Believing that the roadblock was short and the British were attacking up the road, Keiser ordered the 2nd Infantry Division to run through the blockade at 10 a.m.|$|E

5|$|Swedish and Ghanaian {{troops were}} ordered out of Kamina Air Base the {{following}} morning at 05:20. By 06:00 they were advancing down the main road towards the town of Kamina (dubbed Kamina-ville), while a detached Swedish company took back roads to the city through Kiavie. At 06:20 the company spearheading the advance came under heavy machine gun and mortar fire from the Katangese two or three kilometers northeast of Kamina and was ordered by Major Sture Fagerström to retreat 600 meters. The Swedes took cover and regrouped while Fredman organised an armoured car unit. He arrived at the front lines at 07:05 and the peacekeepers began their attack. Supported with mortars, a combat patrol advanced <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> by 07:55 it had broken through the gendarmerie's defences. Swedish medics attended to the wounded Katangese that were left behind {{while the rest of}} the forces began entering the city.|$|E

However, the album was not released until October 2005, when Stradlin—prompted by a fan petition—made it available through internet order.

25|$|On 21 February, Captain Winecoff {{received}} {{a message from}} Colonel Barrow, 9th Marines Commanding Officer, {{to set up an}} ambush along Route 922. The Captain's men needed rest, and he requested a postponement but was denied by Colonel Barrow. The Captain utilized his 1st and 2nd Platoons, and at 16:10, 1st Platoon moved out and made its way to 2nd Platoon's position. At 18:30, Winecoff briefed his men on the ambush. After dark they moved out towards route 922, about 900 meters away. By 01:00, Captain Winecoff and Hotel Company were in place and setting up the ambush. Within minutes of getting into position they started hearing trucks coming <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> continued to observe as 40 minutes later, a lone truck and one PAVN soldier also walked through the kill zone. Winecoff had not wanted the ambush sprung on one truck or soldier, realizing that eventually a bigger target would come down the road. At 02:30, the lights of eight trucks appeared, and as three trucks came into the kill zone the column of vehicles stopped. Not wanting to give away the ambush or their position Winecoff, set off the claymores and the ambush. The Marines poured small arms and automatic weapons fire on the three vehicles, the forward observer alerted the artillery, and rounds bracketed the company position.|$|E

500|$|Around May 28, local family {{planning}} officials phoned Feng {{to try to}} persuade her to have an abortion. The attempt was unsuccessful, so on May 30 they visited the family house while Feng's husband was away at work. [...] At first, authorities tried to persuade her to voluntarily have an abortion. After several hours, she told the officials she was going out to buy food, and left them in her living room. Instead, she went to an aunt's house, but around 15 officials followed her. They did not immediately arrest Feng, instead setting up shifts to keep watch over her at the aunt's house. [...] Early the next morning, Feng escaped, causing the guards to panic. [...] She flagged down a van and persuaded the driver to help her. [...] The driver let her out <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>and</b> Feng hid in hillside brush for the next 14 hours, waiting for the cover of darkness in the cold and rainy weather. [...] When night came, she went to a relative's house in the countryside, where she hid under the bed. Authorities from the {{family planning}} office found her regardless, and allegedly assaulted her. [...] They let her get a night's sleep before taking her to the hospital on June 2. Several witnesses reported that four men carried Feng out of the house with a pillowcase over her head.|$|E

2500|$|Based on {{detailed}} {{studies of}} the statues found along prehistoric roads, archaeologists Terry Hunt and Carl Lipo {{have shown that the}} pattern of breakage, form and position of statues is consistent with an [...] "upright" [...] hypothesis for transportation. Hunt and Lipo argue that when the statues were carved at a quarry, the sculptors left their bases wide and curved along the front edge. They showed that statues along the road have a center of mass that causes the statue to lean forward. As the statue tilts forward, it rocks sideways along its curved front edge and takes a [...] "step." [...] Large flakes are seen broken off of the sides of the bases. They argue that once the stature was [...] "walked" [...] <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> installed in the landscape, the wide and curved base was carved down. [...] All of this evidence points to an upright transportation practice.|$|E

During the retreat from Benghazi, {{commanded}} by the XXIII Corps commander, Lieutenant-General Annibale Bergonzoli the first convoy reached {{the area of}} Beda Fomm, ran into a minefield planted across the road and was engaged by the artillery, anti-tank guns and armoured cars of Combeforce, which threw the column into confusion. Some members of the 10th Bersaglieri tried to advance <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> others on the flanks.

The Bersaglieri had little effect, being unsupported by artillery, most of which was with the rearguard to the north. The vanguard of the Italian retreat had no tanks, few front-line infantry and were trapped by the ambush, which forced them to fight where they stood.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 January 1976, {{just after}} 5.30pm, a red Ford Transit minibus was {{carrying}} sixteen textile workers home from their workplace in Glenanne.

As the bus cleared {{the rise of a}} hill, it was stopped by a man in combat uniform standing on the road and flashing a torch. The workers assumed they were being stopped and searched by the British Army. As the bus stopped, eleven gunmen in combat uniform and with blackened faces emerged from the hedges.
