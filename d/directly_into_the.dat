5|$|Fish ovaries may be {{of three}} types: gymnovarian, {{secondary}} gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the oocytes are released <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> coelomic cavity and then enter the ostium, then through the oviduct and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed ova into the coelom from which they go <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the oviduct. Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in lungfish, sturgeon, and bowfin. Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct. Secondary gymnovaries are found in salmonids {{and a few other}} teleosts.|$|E

5|$|The {{hemolymph}} usually lacks any respiratory pigment, although {{members of}} the families Arcidae and Limidae are known to possess haemoglobin dissolved <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> serum. In the carnivorous genus Poromya, the hemolymph has red amoebocytes containing a haemoglobin pigment.|$|E
5|$|An {{intrathecal}} pump infuses an opioid such as morphine <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fluid-filled space (the subarachnoid cavity) {{between the}} spinal cord and its protective sheath, providing enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects. This can reduce the level of pain in otherwise intractable cases. An anxiolytic or a nonopioid analgesic, and local anesthetics may also be infused along with the opioid.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon {{has four}} {{patterns}} of drainage. In the south, the principal rivers are the Ntem, Nyong, Sanaga, and Wouri. These flow southwestward or westward <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Guinea. The Dja and Kadéï drain southeastward into the Congo River. In northern Cameroon, the Bénoué River runs {{north and west}} and empties into the Niger. The Logone flows northward into Lake Chad, which Cameroon shares with three neighbouring countries.|$|E

5|$|During the Kamakura and Muromachi period, samurai wore a short sword {{known as}} koshigatana in {{addition}} to the long tachi. Koshigatana were stuck <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> belt {{in the same way as}} later the katana and uchigatana. They had a mounting without a guard (tsuba). The corresponding style is known as aikuchi ("fitting mouth") as the mouth of the scabbard meets the hilt directly without intervening guard.|$|E
5|$|If the {{symptoms}} of delayed ischemia do not improve with medical treatment, angiography may be attempted to identify the sites of vasospasms and administer vasodilator medication (drugs that relax the blood vessel wall) <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> artery. Angioplasty (opening the constricted area with a balloon) may also be performed.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaching}} the final, United won nine and drew {{three of their}} 12 matches, dwarfing their record of four wins and six draws in the 10 games they took to reach the final in 1999 (when there was no first knockout round and teams advanced from the group stage <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> quarter-finals). United scored 19 goals {{en route to the}} final, Ronaldo scoring seven of them, more than any other player.|$|E

5|$|Like {{some other}} birds, the Columbidae have no gall bladders.

5|$|One B-26, {{after being}} seriously damaged by {{anti-aircraft}} fire, made a suicide run on Akagi. Making {{no attempt to}} pull out of its run, the aircraft narrowly missed crashing <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> carrier's bridge, which could have killed Nagumo and his command staff. This experience may well have contributed to Nagumo's determination to launch another attack on Midway, in direct violation of Yamamoto's order to keep the reserve strike force armed for anti-ship operations.|$|E
5|$|Plans were {{announced}} in February 2016 which proposed a new £200M road {{could be built}} through Rimrose Valley to link <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> A5758 road {{in an effort to}} reduce the heavy congestion on the A5036 road; Sefton Council rejected the proposal in March 2017, citing the desire to instead build a tunnel to overcome the congestion concerns.|$|E

5|$|The Port of Portland began {{efforts in}} 1997 {{to reduce the}} flow of {{aircraft}} deicing chemicals from the airport into the waterway, though it still diverted concentrated chemicals (mostly glycol) <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> slough during rare times of reservoir overflow. By 2012, the Port had completed work on an enhanced system that collects, stores, and treats the chemicals, and {{is more likely to}} direct runoff to the Columbia River than the slough.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is driven by}} the {{sympathetic}} nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord, from vertebrae T5–T11. Because it is innervated by preganglionic nerve fibers, the adrenal medulla can be considered as a specialized sympathetic ganglion. Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> blood.|$|E
