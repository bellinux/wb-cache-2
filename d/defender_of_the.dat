5|$|Chabon's work is {{characterized}} by complex language, the frequent use of metaphor along with recurring themes, including nostalgia, divorce, abandonment, fatherhood, and most notably issues of Jewish identity. He often includes gay, bisexual, and Jewish characters in his work. Since the late 1990s, Chabon has written in an increasingly diverse series of styles for varied outlets; he is a notable <b>defender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> merits of genre fiction and plot-driven fiction, and, along with novels, he has published screenplays, children's books, comics, and newspaper serials.|$|E
5|$|He {{also studied}} {{philosophical}} {{texts of the}} Spanish Enlightenment {{under the tutelage of}} the priest Terrazas, and aspired to implement the new ideas in his country. He wrote a thesis with strong criticism of the native slavery at the mines of Potosí, influenced by the Spanish jurist Juan de Solorzano Pereira, the foremost publisher of Indian Law, and Victoria Villalva, fiscal of the Audiencia of Charcas and <b>defender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indigenous cause.|$|E

5|$|Outside her {{political}} duties Bessie, a keen fan of boxing, accepted the honorary {{presidency of the}} Professional Boxers' Association, and was a passionate <b>defender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sport. Her enthusiasm arose in part from her experiences as a juvenile court magistrate; she believed that the sport fostered character and mutual respect. She was frequently at odds with her parliamentary colleague Edith Summerskill, a physician who wrote the anti-boxing tract The Ignoble Art, and campaigned for the sport's abolition.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth {{has held}} many titles and honorary {{military}} positions throughout the Commonwealth, is Sovereign of many orders {{in her own}} countries, and has received honours and awards from around the world. In each of her realms she has a distinct title that follows a similar formula: Queen of Jamaica and her other realms and territories in Jamaica, Queen of Australia and her other realms and territories in Australia, etc. In the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, which are Crown dependencies rather than separate realms, she is known as Duke of Normandy and Lord of Mann, respectively. Additional styles include <b>Defender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Faith and Duke of Lancaster. When in conversation with the Queen, the practice is to initially address her as Your Majesty and thereafter as Ma'am.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Zara Yaqob also {{continued}} as the <b>defender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Patriarch of Alexandria. When he heard in 1441 {{of the destruction}} of the Egyptian monastery of Debre Mitmaq by Sultan Az-Zahir Sayf-ad-Din Jaqmaq, he called for a period of mourning, then sent a letter of strong protest to the Sultan. He reminded Jaqmaq that he had Muslim subjects whom he treated fairly, and warned that he had the power to divert the Nile, but refrained from doing so for the human suffering it would cause. Jaqmaq responded with gifts to appease Zara Yaqob's anger, but refused to rebuild the Coptic Churches he had destroyed.|$|E
5|$|For the 2013 season, Sauerbrunn as named co-captain {{along with}} Holiday. Sauerbrunn made her first {{appearance}} in the team's season opener against the Portland Thorns on April 14, 2013.

5|$|Immediately thereafter, Hickling was {{transferred}} to Malaya as its first parliamentary draftsman, and in that capacity he helped to prepare the Malayan (now Malaysian) constitution for that country's independence from Britain in 1957. Subsequently, as Commissioner of Law Revision he drafted the Internal Security Act of 1960, based on the Emergency Ordinance 1948 which had been enacted to provide the British colonial authorities with powers to tackle a communist insurgency. For his contributions to Malaya, Hickling was made a Companion of the Order of the <b>Defender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Realm (known in Malay as the Johan Mangku Negara or JMN) by the Malaysian head of state, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, in 1960.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Frank {{was elected}} to the Massachusetts House of Representatives where he served for eight years. He {{made a name for himself}} in the mid-1970s as a {{political}} <b>defender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Combat Zone, Boston’s notorious red light district. Neighborhoods in Frank’s district bordered the Combat Zone. As a means of dealing with crime in the area (including violence, police corruption and the infiltration by organized crime), he introduced a bill into the Massachusetts General Court that would have legalized the sex-for-hire business but kept it quarantined in a red light district, which would have been moved to Boston’s Financial District. The bill, which had the support of Boston’s Police Commissioner, never came up for a vote. Later, when Frank was running for Congress, opponents erroneously portrayed him as having attempted to permit red-light districts in all Bay State communities.|$|E
5|$|In 405 AD, the Ostrogoths invaded Italy itself, {{but were}} defeated. However, in 406 AD an {{unprecedented}} number of tribes {{took advantage of}} the freezing of the Rhine to cross en masse: Vandals, Suevi, Alans and Burgundians swept across the river and met little resistance in the Sack of Moguntiacum and the Sack of Treviri, completely overrunning Gaul. Despite this grave danger, or perhaps because of it, the Roman army continued to be wracked by usurpation, in one of which Stilicho, Rome's foremost <b>defender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period, was put to death.|$|E

5|$|In Bulgarian and South Slavic {{folklore}} in general, Momchil is glorified {{in numerous}} songs and epic tales as a brigand, <b>defender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{people and a}} prominent fighter against the Turks. Indeed, {{some of the earliest}} heroic songs in Bulgarian folklore tradition deal with Momchil's exploits. In some folklore material, Momchil, referred to as a duke, acts as the uncle of Prince Marko, another legendary figure who in epic poetry is a fighter against the Turks. In the folklore version of Momchil's last battle, his wife, and not the citizens of Peritheorion, betrays him and is to blame for his death. On the other hand, Momchil's legendary sister Yevrosima is described as the mother of Prince Marko as well as a major influence on him.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, the Western New York Flash, {{previously}} {{part of the}} W-League, {{joined the}} WPS for the 2011 season. Shortly after, Engen signed with the team. She played in 17 of the team's 18 regular season games to help the Flash finish first {{in the regular season}} and advance to the playoffs. Engen appeared in the 2011 WPS Championship on August 27, 2011 against the Philadelphia Independence. The game was tied 1–1 after regulation and extra time, leaving the outcome of the match to be decided by penalty kicks. The Flash won the championship after goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris blocked the shot by Philadelphia's Laura del Rio. Following the 2011 season, Engen was named WPS <b>Defender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year and to the 2011 WPS Top XI.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} his {{historical}} interests he initiated the erection of a statue for the murdered Grand Pensionary of Holland, Johan de Witt (1625–1672). The statue {{was designed and}} made by the Dutch sculptor Frederik Engel Jeltsema. The unveiling in The Hague on 12 June 1918 was a national event. The actual unveiling was done by Queen Wilhelmina, with several ministers in attendance. The statue stands close {{to the place where}} De Witt and his brother Cornelis were killed by a mob in 1672. On the side of the socle a text is engraved which – in translation – reads: 'Leader and servant of the Republic, designer of it most powerful fleets, <b>defender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freedom of the seas, caretaker of the State's coffers, mathematician. He was a perfect Dutchman.' Muller had an important hand in the formulation of the text.|$|E

5|$|In the {{circumstances}} {{it was hardly}} possible for the new king to show adaptability or tolerance or diplomatic skill, which are the fruit of long experience in human relationships. Confronted with a desperate and chaotic situation he met it instead with grim determination and implacable ferocity. Towards {{the end of his}} life, forfeiting the affection and loyalty even of his courtiers and family he became a lonely figure, isolated by suspicion and mistrust. But, in spite of all, the name of this great <b>defender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> faith {{is one of the most}} memorable in Ethiopian history.|$|E
5|$|Player {{selection}} {{during the}} previous stages of the Open Cup was a challenge due to key personnel receiving call-ups for the World Cup. The Sounders had depth that could withstand losing players, and did not rest starters in the lead-up to the final game. The Union rested several starters {{during the previous}} weekend's league match. Philadelphia's Casey, Le Toux, and Cristian Maidana were significant attacking threats, while Seattle had the striking pair of Martins and Clint Dempsey. Defensively, Edu was Philadelphia's strongest player. Seattle also had a strong defense with young national team prospect DeAndre Yedlin, and eventual MLS <b>Defender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year Chad Marshall.|$|E
