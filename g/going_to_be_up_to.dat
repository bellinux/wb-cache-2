2500|$|In June 2013, Marvel {{announced}} The Fearless Defenders #10 (October 2013) would {{tie into}} the Infinity crossover event. Bunn said, [...] "The main Infinity crossover {{will be in}} Fearless Defenders #10. They're here on Earth facing the threat of Thanos’ forces trying to raze the city of New York... At the same time though, {{not only are they}} going to be dealing with Thanos’ forces, they're going to be dealing with the ever-present Caroline Le Fay who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> no good during this event and it's all going to center around this new character who'll be surfacing in the issue, a new super-powered individual." [...] Bunn also revealed that The Fearless Defenders #10 will be a dance issue explaining, [...] "I’m not sure how many dance comic books are out there anyway, but definitely not dance super hero comics. I’ve tried to do different things with the book from the beginning and this issue will definitely live up to that ideal." ...|$|E

[...] "Why didn't {{you say what}} you were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to?</b> Starting the ship ahead at full speed without notice! I believe I've broken some of my ribs. Don't you laugh too soon, Jack. It will be your turn next." ...|$|E
6000|$|That night, Nigel gave {{a dinner}} party on Maggie's account at the fashionable London hotel of the moment. Invitations had been sent out by telephone, by hurried notes, {{in one or two}} cases were {{delivered}} by word of mouth. On the whole, the acceptances, considering the season was in full swing, were a little remarkable. Every one was anxious to come, because, as one of her girl friends put it, no one ever knew what Maggie was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> next. One of the few refusals came from Prince Shan, and even he made use of compromise: ...|$|E

Whenever Harold isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> for dinner or for the evening you're always relieved. Possibly you don't realize it yourself, but you show it to any one who knows you." ...|$|R

The club was losing its soul there for a long time. He got it back on track. Now its <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the people at Carlton now to keep it going.|$|E
5000|$|As {{early as}} 2003, Brooks wrote favorably of {{same-sex}} marriage, {{pointing out that}} marriage is a traditional conservative value. Rather than opposing it, he wrote: [...] "We should insist on gay marriage. We should regard it as scandalous that two people could claim {{to love each other}} and not want to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity.... It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> conservatives to make the important, moral case for marriage, including gay marriage." ...|$|E
5000|$|Senior vice {{president}} of competition Scott Miller explained that the new rule was meant to improve safety, explaining that [...] "It's more about crashed vehicles and all that is involved with that, from the crew guys to the drivers to dropping more debris on the track, which always happens. So there are exceptions for mechanical failures, those things can be rectified in the garage. That's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the series director's discretion to make those calls, but it's {{not going to be}} that difficult. These rules severely restrict the ability for cars to return to the race multiple laps down in hopes of gaining minimal points.|$|E

5000|$|The USO {{also brought}} Hollywood celebrities and {{volunteer}} entertainers {{to perform for}} the troops. According to movie historian Steven Cohan, [...] "most of all ... in taking home on the road, it equated the nation with showbiz. USO camp shows were designed in their export to remind soldiers of home." [...] They did this, he noted, by [...] "nurturing in troops a sense of patriotic identification with America through popular entertainment." [...] An article in Look magazine at the time, stated, [...] "For the little time the show lasts, the men are taken straight to the familiar Main Street that {{is the goal of}} every fighting American far away from home." [...] Maxene Andrews wrote, [...] "The entertainment brought home to the boys. Their home." [...] Actor George Raft stated {{at the beginning of the}} war, [...] "Now it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> us to send to the men here and abroad real, living entertainment, the songs, the dances, and the laughs they had back home." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cindy's 'gold-digging' {{personality}} became clearer {{after her}} return. Cindy and Darren Osborne decided to scam Tony Hutchinson {{out of his}} money. However, the character changed her plans and decided not to marry Tony for his money. Talking about {{the conclusion of the}} storyline, Waring stated: [...] "I think she's definitely out for what she can get — she's always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> something! We're going to have to see what happens with this but I don't think she'll change who she's become {{over the last eight years}} in Spain. It's important that we see she's not this one-dimensional gold-digging tart, though. There were some episodes in normal Hollyoaks where we saw this a little bit when she thought Tony was just with her for her looks and Holly didn't want to be like her. In Later this spills out again and we get to see more of the Cindy there once was before moving to Spain." [...] In another interview, she said: [...] "She uses her outer image to hide who she really is inside and in Later we discover she's just a normal girl who wants to find love and security and have a secure life with her daughter and have a family — she's found that in Tony." [...] After their postponed wedding, Cindy admitted her plans to Tony and the pair split up, however they agreed to get married, which they did in Hollyoaks Later.|$|E

5000|$|Many opponents {{attempted}} to make religious or moral arguments against the ordinance saying that it would erode the city's moral fabric and that they didn't. want their children <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exposed <b>to</b> values they didn't agree with.

5000|$|IGN's Jonathan Miller {{said of the}} Xbox 360 version: [...] "In the end, NBA 2K6 is a solid {{basketball}} {{title that}} really rests on the laurels of its predecessors. Even though the game can look absolutely amazing at time, it's still, at its heart, the same exact game {{that we saw in}} the current generation. While 2K6 was a very good game on those consoles, we want to be blown away by our next-generation games. Someone who already owns the current-gen version will be hard pressed to drop $59.99 on this version, but those new to the series may want to look into it. It's still the best basketball title on the 360. Unfortunately, that isn't saying too much." [...] Ronnie Hobbs of GameZone felt the gameplay of the same console version was good, but could have been better, thought the player's designs were [...] "unbelievably life-like", but other visuals, such as the court, were lacking, praised the commentary, calling it [...] "perfection", and liked the [...] "fun" [...] online modes, even if partially plagued by technical issues. Hobbs summed up the review by saying: [...] "In my opinion NBA 2K6 is the best basketball game available on the 360, but whether it’s worth the $59.99 price tag is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> you. The decision is a no-brainer for people who don’t already own it on the Xbox or PS2, but for those who have played it before, the slick presentation just might not be enough to warrant an upgrade." ...|$|E
