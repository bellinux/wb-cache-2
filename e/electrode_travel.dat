50|$|A {{nanoscale}} vacuum-channel transistor {{is essentially}} a miniaturized version of a vacuum tube. It consists of a field-emitter electron source, a collector electrode, and a gate electrode. The electron source and the collector electrodes are separated by a small distance, usually {{of the order of}} several nanometers. When a voltage is applied across the source and the collector electrode, due to field-emission, electrons are emitted from the source <b>electrode,</b> <b>travel</b> through the gap and are collected by the collector electrode. Since the gap i.e., the distance between the source and collector is smaller than the mean free path of the gas molecules, vacuum-channel transistors do not need vacuum to operate. The gate electrode is used to control the current flow through the vacuum-channel.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the factors which influence the gas rate (volume of gas produced per unit arc energy) in insulating oil. Such data are fundamental to the design of oil circuit breakers. It is found that the gas rate varies with electrode length, location of arc on the surface, duration of current and material of arcing surface. The gas rate is higher for the longer gap length (3 / 4 inch) than for the shorter gap length (1 / 4 inch). An arc on the center of the surface generally gives a lower gas rate while that on the edge a higher gas rate. For arcs occurring on the center, copper surface has a higher gas rate while steel and silver elkalite (alloy used in practice) surfaces have approximately the same lower rate. A high gas rate results in the short duration arc of 1 / 2 cycle and nearly equal low gas rates are obtained for durations of 2 cycles and 3 1 / 2 cycles. No appreciable change in gas rate is observed as the magnitude of current peak varies from 400 to 800 amperes. With the method used in this research, steel surfaces have the desired character that arcs always occur on the center. For 600 amperes and 2 cycle duration, the gas rate of flat steel surfaces referred to 760 mm and 25 [degrees]C is 74, 133 and 175 cubic centimeters per kilowatt second at 1 / 4, 1 / 2 and 3 / 4 inch gap lengths respectively. Because the gas rate for silver elkalite and steel surfaces are about the same with arcs on the center, the effect of current magnitude is small and the arc duration in most circuit breaker operation about 2 cycles, the total volume of gas produced in actual operation of a circuit breaker can be calculated approximately by correlating the above figures with field test records of arc energy and <b>electrode</b> <b>travel...</b>|$|E

Bulk samples with a nominal composition of Bi 1 : 6 Pb 0 : 4 Sr 2 Ca 3 Cu 4 Ox (2234) were prepared as rods by a melt casting process. An electrical eld {{was applied to}} the BSCCO rods and this current caused the resistance of the rod to fall and after a few minutes the initial voltage fell while the current was increased to 2. 5 A. Under certain conditions, a well-dened hot zone formed at the positive <b>electrode,</b> <b>travelled</b> along the rod and eventually disappeared on reaching the negative electrode. A small increase in the applied current when the zone approached the negative electrode produced another zone at the positive electrode which then exhibited similar behaviour to the rst. Reversing the polarity caused the zone to travel in the opposite direction. The rods were characterized by means of microstructural and physical property studies. The results of this metod indicates a possible alternative processing route for crystallization of the glassy BSCCO rods and producing superconducting phase. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Cochlear {{electrode}} insertion is {{a challenging}} manual procedure. One technique requires the physician {{to coordinate the}} motions of an electrode array approximately 1 mm in diameter and the smaller stylet within it, using miniature forceps. A new minimally invasive access technique precludes forceps insertion because the <b>electrode</b> must <b>travel</b> through a small-diameter drilled hole to reach the cochlear access point. To address this, we present an automated insertion tool. This second generation device not only enables deployment in the minimally invasive setting, but also makes insertion velocity profiles repeatable and can sense insertion forces. Force sensing is essential because insertion forces can indicate impending damage to cochlear membranes, but are below the thresholds that can be sensed by human hands. The Automated Insertion Tool we present {{is designed to be}} compact and lightweight for straightforward integration into the operating room environment. It is able to insert an electrode with a resolution of less than 1 µm, achieve velocities of up to 5 mm/sec and resolve forces as small as 0. 005 N...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{activated}} TIG (ATIG) {{welding process}} mainly focuses on increasing {{the depth of}} penetration and {{the reduction in the}} width of weld bead has not been paid much attention. The shape of a weld in terms of its width-to-depth ratio known as aspect ratio has a marked influence on its solidification cracking tendency. The major influencing ATIG welding parameters, such as <b>electrode</b> gap, <b>travel</b> speed, current and voltage, that aid in controlling the aspect ratio of DSS joints, must be optimized to obtain desirable aspect ratio for DSS joints. Hence in this study, the above parameters of ATIG welding for aspect ratio of ASTM/UNS S 32205 DSS welds are optimized by using Taguchi orthogonal array (OA) experimental design and other statistical tools such as Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Pooled ANOVA techniques. The optimum process parameters are found to be 1  mm electrode gap, 130  mm/min travel speed, 140  A current and 12  V voltage. The aspect ratio and the ferrite content for the DSS joints fabricated using the optimized ATIG parameters are found to be well within the acceptable range and there is no macroscopically evident solidification cracking...|$|R

A novel high aspect ratio MEMS fabrication sequence {{in combination with}} wafer level packaging is applied for fabrication of the samples and allows for a relatively large actuation electrode area, and for high actuation force resulting in fast onresponse time of 10 s and off-response time of 6 s at less than 5 V actuation voltage.

40|$|Electrochemical {{reduction}} of CO 2 in aqueous buffer solutions of different pHs at tin electrodes was studied. The partial current densities exhibited the expected two Tafel regions; with increasingly negative electrode potential, {{the first to}} be encountered depended on pH strongly, while the second showed only weak dependence. Formate and CO were observed as the main products. In the range of potentials studied, the highest charge yield of 0. 67 was achieved at - 1. 55 V (AgCl|Ag) in 0. 5 M NaOH saturated with 1 atm CO 2 with a total current density of 36. 2 A m- 2. pH was also found to affect the formation ratios of CO to formate, the value of which ranged from 1 to 0. 15 as pH was increased from 2. 9 to 7. 8. However, pH was not an ideal variable to adjust the product distributions because lower pH led to a lower charge yield of CO 2 reduction due to increasingly competing hydrogen evolution. Two mathematical kinetic models based on slightly different concepts were developed to quantify the dependence of the formation ratios on pH and to predict partial current densities of CO 2 reduction at different pHs and electrode potentials. The first model assumed that there could be multiple reactions having different stoichiometric coefficients of proton consumption occurring simultaneously; the greater the coefficient, the stronger was the preference for CO production from the reaction. The other concept was that there were multiple protonation states of the intermediate in CO 2 reduction; the higher the protonation state, the higher was the tendency to form CO from the intermediate. Both concepts allowed variations of the product ratios as a function of pH, but the latter model was preferred because more accurate predictions of the partial current densities were achieved and a generalised reaction mechanism could be derived. Electrochemical {{reduction of}} CO 2 in 0. 5 M NaOH saturated with 1 atm CO 2 at tin-coated graphite felt electrodes was also studied. Tin was deposited on graphite felt from aqueous solutions of 0. 3 M K 2 [Sn(OH) 6], 0. 4 M KOH and 0. 5 M K 3 PO 4. The effects of electrode potential and electrolyte flow rates on the performances of CO 2 reduction at 3 D electrodes were explored. The best performance was achieved at - 1. 62 V (AgCl|Ag) and 99 ml min- 1 electrolyte flow rate; the total current density and the charge yield of formate were 971 A m- 2 and 0. 58, respectively. Accumulation of gas bubbles composed of H 2 and CO was found to have detrimental effects on superficial electrolyte conductivities and mass transport of CO 2, but can be partially alleviated by increasing the electrolyte flow rate. Two mathematical models were developed to include the effect of flow rates into account in predicting total current densities and formate charge yields from 3 D electrodes. The first model assumed that the gas bubbles inside porous <b>electrodes</b> <b>travelled</b> at the same velocities as the electrolyte solutions; this led to highly under-predicted potential drops across the electrode thickness and over-predicted total current densities. On the other hand, the second model allowed slip between bubble flows and electrolyte flows, resulting in more accurate predictions. Bubbles were found to travel 0. 0016 times slower than electrolyte flow velocities. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|The tobacco hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, {{is a model}} {{organism}} {{that has}} been used to understand how animal's olfactory systems process information. The neural circuits in its primary olfactory center, the AL, are analogous in many ways to the olfactory bulb in vertebrate species. In moths, individual neurons comprising the olfactory circuits in different synaptic centers are highly diverse and interconnected in very complicated ways, and thus are difficult to analyze. To overcome this problem, my project took "survey-like" approach to determine what types of individual neurons are connected to a specific largely unexplored higher olfactory center, the lateral horn. This region is targeted by all projection neurons-output neurons-of the AL. A particular region within the lateral horn (delta region) in male moths receives input from projection neurons that process information about conspecific female sex pheromone of this species. It remains unclear how many types of neurons innervate this region.

40|$|Two {{computer-aided}} design methods {{are described in}} this dissertation {{for the design of}} Thermionic Integrated Circuits (TIC). Such circuits combine vacuum tube techniques with modern integrated circuit techniques to produce microminiature vacuum tube circuits, with possibly hundreds of vacuum triodes on a single substrate. The first method described in the line charge approximation technique in which the TIC devices are modelled as collections of line charges. A TIC is produced by evaporating metal electrodes on one or two sapphire substrates. The entire structure is heated to about 850 °C so that electrons are emitted from the cathode <b>electrodes</b> to <b>travel</b> to the plate electrodes as in a conventional vacuum triode. The line charge approximation method is easy to implement and provides a simple means of satisfying the sapphire dielectric boundary conditions of the TIC basic problems, which are electrostatics problems since space charge effects are neglected. The method requires only a single matrix inversion and is a finite element Green's function approach. The method uses no iteration as in previous TIC analysis methods. Later as the development of TIC devices proceeded further it was found that conducting shields had to be placed over the unused sapphire surface so that the basic problem became a metal box problem. For this case a second method was developed called the step and ramp function method in which each electrode is modelled by a step function, which is the electric field solution for a potential step on a zero potential boundary. A superposition of these step functions models the TIC electrodes. The method provides direct calculation of the electric fields from equations and requires no iteration or matrix inversion. The potential variation between electrodes is modelled by linear potential functions called ramps. A superposition of steps and ramps completely specifies a TIC structure. The method does not solve for the case of electrodes which are elevated above substrates. For this case a modified line charge method was developed but not implemented...|$|R
40|$|The {{approach}} that we propose {{here in this}} SBIR proposal is a modified water electrolysis cell. In conventional water electrolysis the H 2 O is split into electrons, protons, and oxygen gas at the anode <b>electrode.</b> The electrons <b>travel</b> through an external power source and the protons travel through an electrolyte membrane to the cathode where they recombine to form hydrogen gas. The power source requires a minimum of 1. 23 V to overcome the potential difference of the electrodes for the splitting of water. In contrast in our approach proposed here, instead of splitting water we are using acetate in wastewater and bacteria to oxidize the acetate into electrons and protons at the anode surface. The microbes release the electrons to the anode and the resulting protons move to the cathode electrode through the proton exchange membrane as described above and recombine to form hydrogen gas.

40|$|Three {{mechanisms}} for spatially resolved growth and removal of oxide on silicon substrates have been investigated. Thermally grown oxide layers with thicknesses {{in the range}} 2 - 6 nm were the distinctive feature of the system. The layers were characterized and manipulated by methodologies based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) with conducting probes in a vacuum environment of 10 - 2 - 10 - 3 Pa. The probe is then effectively a <b>travelling</b> <b>electrode</b> that generates an electrostatic field between the tip and the substrate. Oxide growth was induced for a positive sample bias greater than 5 V, but below the level corresponding to dielectric breakdown. Application of a short pulse of amplitude marginally above that corresponding to dielectric breakdown, on the other hand, {{had the effect of}} producing pits of inner diameter of about 10 nm in the pre-existing oxide layer at the point of tip-to-oxide contact. Application of a low positive sample bias (less than that required for measurable oxide growth) in combination with high linear scan speed had the effect of removing a pre-existing oxide layer from the scanned field of view. The most plausible mechanisms are based on transverse ionic diffusion (for oxide growth), controlled dielectric breakdown (for formation of pits) and lateral transport of silicaceous species (for oxide removal).

40|$|Many microdevices for {{manipulating}} {{particles and}} cells use electric fields {{to produce a}} motive force on the particles. The movement of particles in non-uniform electric fields is called dielectrophoresis, and the usual method of applying this effect is to pass the particle suspension over a microelectrode structure. If the suspension has a noticeable conductivity, one important side effect is that the electric field drives a substantial conduction current through the fluid, causing localized Joule-heating. The resulting thermal gradient produces local conductivity and permittivity changes in the fluid. dielectrophoretic forces acting upon these pockets of fluid will then produce motion of both the fluid and the particles. This paper presents a numerical solution of the electrical force and the resulting electrothermal driven fluid flow on a travelling wave structure. This common electrode geometry consists of interdigitated electrodes laid down in a long array, with the phase of the applied potential shifted by 90 ° on each subsequent <b>electrode.</b> The resulting <b>travelling</b> electric field was simulated and the thermal field and electrical body force on the fluid calculated, for devices constructed from two typical materials: silicon and glass. The electrothermal fluid flow in the electrolyte over the electrode array was then numerically simulated. The model predicts that the thermal field depends on the conductivity and applied voltage, but more importantly on the geometry {{of the system and}} the material used {{in the construction of the}} device. The velocity of the fluid flow depends critically on the same parameters, with slight differences in the thermal field for glass and silicon leading to diametrically opposite flow direction with respect to the travelling field for the two materials. In addition, the imposition of slight external temperature gradients is shown to have a large effect on the fluid flow in the device, under certain conditions leading to a reversal of the fluid flow direction...|$|R

Direct electrolysis of magnesmm from its oxide is less expensive and more environmentally friendly than current methods of magnesium production. The solid oxide membrane (SOM) process is a viable method for production of magnesium via direct electrolysis. In the SOM process magnesium oxide is dissolved in a molten flux, which acts as a supporting electrolyte. A yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) membrane is immersed in the flux and separates the anode from the cathode. When an electrical potential is applied between <b>electrodes,</b> magnesium cations <b>travel</b> through the flux to a steel cathode where they are reduced. Simultaneously, oxygen anions travel through the YSZ to a liquid metal anode where they are oxidized. However, in order for the SOM process to be commercially successful it must run for thousands of hours at high current efficiencies. It is believed the degradation of the YSZ membrane determines the lifetime and operating costs of the SOM process. This study investigates the mechanisms of YSZ membrane degradation. There are two main pathways of YSZ degradation: 1) yttria (yttrium oxide) diffusion out of the membrane, and 2) electronic conductivity in the flux providing a pathway for the applied potential to reduce the YSZ membrane. It is shown through diffusion experiments that the loss of yttria from the membrane into the oxy-fluoride flux can be prevented by adding yttrium fluoride to the flux, so that the activity of yttria in the flux is equal to the activity of yttria in the membrane. The electronic conductivity then becomes the primary source of membrane degradation in the SOM process. Electronic conductivity lowers the current efficiency of the SOM process. It is shown through measurements that the electronic conductivity is reduced by lowering the magnesium solubility in the flux. This is accomplished by performing SOM electrolysis at a reduced pressure (70 %). Thus tlus process provides a basis for a successful commercial operation for the direct electrolysis of magnesium oxide...|$|R
40|$|Pulsed Plasma Thrusters (PPTs) {{are long}} {{standing}} electric propulsion thrusters that are reliable, relatively simple and low cost. One {{of the main}} issues with the PPT is its poor utilization of the propellant and low efficiency. Typically only 40 - 60 % of the propellant contributes to the production significant impulse and the efficiency is around 8 %. The cause of the PPT’s poor propellant utilization is the late time ablation (LTA), which has {{a major impact on}} the efficiency. LTA is the sublimation of propellant that takes place after the main discharge, due to the propellant, usually Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon®), being at a temperature above its sublimation point. The LTA produces a low speed gas and macro particles that do not contribute significantly to the thrust. This work presents a way of accelerating the late time ablation by employing an additional discharge after the main discharge, in a separate pair of electrodes. A new thruster, called the two-stage pulsed plasma thruster (TS-PPT) was built and tested. This thruster has two pair of electrodes: primary and secondary. The primary is placed in contact with the propellant surface, as in a regular PPT. The secondary is placed downstream, relatively far from the propellant. A new approach, dividing the PPT thrust generation in two phases, was envisioned. The first phase is responsible for the ablation process and takes place in the first pair of electrodes. The second phase takes place in the second pair of electrodes and is responsible for the acceleration process. The phase division allowed for propellant metering and better propellant utilization. Evidence was found that a pair of electrodes placed downstream, further from the propellant surface is able to discharge in the late ablation portion of the propellant and can impart extra energy into the exhaust and improve propellant utilization. A simple analytical model was developed to predict trends. A prototype of a TS-PPT was designed and built. A vacuum facility was modified, adapted, partially designed and built. An average mass bit consumption test was carried out. A simple time-of-flight experiment revealed that the fastest portions of the plasma from the primary <b>electrodes</b> discharge were <b>travelling</b> at around 33 km/s. Several current measurements were performed and calculations of the total electrical resistance, total inductance, electromagnetic impulse bit, specific impulse, efficiency, and other parameters were calculated based on experimental data.

Specific impulses as high as 4000 s were calculated based on experimental results, indicating a better propellant utilization...|$|R
