2500|$|Feedstocks {{can include}} {{biodegradable}} waste materials, such as waste paper, <b>grass</b> <b>clippings,</b> leftover food, sewage, and animal waste. Woody wastes are the exception, {{because they are}} largely unaffected by digestion, as most anaerobes are unable to degrade lignin. Xylophalgeous anaerobes (lignin consumers) or using high temperature pretreatment, such as pyrolysis, {{can be used to}} break down the lignin. Anaerobic digesters can also be fed with specially grown energy crops, such as silage, for dedicated biogas production. In Germany and continental Europe, these facilities are referred to as [...] "biogas" [...] plants. A codigestion or cofermentation plant is typically an agricultural anaerobic digester that accepts two or more input materials for simultaneous digestion.|$|E

40|$|Biomass {{makes up}} {{approximately}} 16 % of the landfills (this number can vary significantly {{depending upon the}} geographical location and time of the year). A majority of the biomass disposed in landfills is comprised of yard waste including <b>grass</b> and leaf <b>clippings.</b> This is becoming a problem as most landfills {{are running out of}} space and it is expensive to build new landfills. Twenty-four states have prohibited the disposal of yard waste in landfills with more states likely to follow suit. To conserve landfill space it is important to identify processes and methods for effective utilization and disposal of yard waste. It has been shown in this research that conformal coating of a biomass suspension can be utilized as an alternative daily cover (ADC) for the landfills. The biomass is ground into fine particles (d ≤ 2 mm) and suspended in a surfactant solution. This approach can reduce the cost of daily operations for the landfill and provide {{a solution to the problem}} of yard waste disposal...|$|R
40|$|Zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp.), cv. El Toro {{was used}} in this {{experiment}} to evaluate its shoot growth in terms of length and dry weight under control and different levels of Bio-Turf-Pro applications in a pot study. Four treatments [Control (no Bio-Turf-Pro), 8 Fl Oz/Gal (½ the recommended rate) per 1000 ft², 16 Fl Oz/Gal (recommended rate) per 1000 ft², and 32 Fl Oz/Gal (twice the recommended rate) per 1000 ft² of Bio-Turf-Pro], and six replications of each treatment were used in a RCB design in this investigation. Plants were allowed to grow under the above treatment conditions for eight weeks. Plant shoots (clippings) were harvested bi-weekly for the evaluation of the dry-matter production. At each harvest, shoot lengths were measured and recorded and the visual growth was also evaluated before the harvest was made. The harvested plant materials were oven dried at 60 o C and dry weights were measured and recorded. The shoot growth (length) was stimulated under any levels of Bio-Turf- Pro application rates compared with the control. Among the treatment rates, the 16 Fl Oz/Gal (the recommended rate) per 1000 ft²] numerically stimulated the shoot length the most. However in most cases, there was not statistically significant differences detected among the 8 (½ the recommended rate) per 1000 ft², 16 Fl Oz/Gal (the recommended rate) per 1000 ft²] and the 32 Fl Oz/Gal (twice the recommended rate) per 1000 ft²] application rates of the compound on the shoot length of the <b>grass.</b> The shoot (<b>clippings)</b> dry weights of the plants followed essentially the same pattern as the shoot lengths. The visual evaluation of the grass supported the measured parameters...|$|R
40|$|Not only due to {{the actual}} climate change, but also in {{consideration}} of exhaustible resources, alternative energy supplies for the steadily growing energy demand need to be found. The main emphasis {{should be placed on}} the substitution of fossil fuels with agricultural by-products and other organic materials. Especially, the utilisation of fresh grass or grass silage of extensively cultivated farm land has great potential as an energy feedstock, as in agriculture this bio-resource is currently considered a waste material and is neither economically nor ecologically utilised in an efficient way. Additionally, the lawn-clippings, which are accumulating as communal and private waste could be used for energy production since many local authorities have problems with utilising this gramineous waste. Thus, for anaerobic digestion big amounts of grass biomass and lawn substrates are available from farmers and landscape conservation. In order to evaluate the suitability of this material for biogas plants in the first place, a detailed inventory needs to be conducted. This was exemplarily done for the Hamburg District Bergedorf (155 km 2). The result shows that approximately 10, 000 Mg/a of <b>grass</b> and lawn <b>clippings</b> could theoretically be made available. By laboratory investigations, in batch tests, the theoretical biogas potentials of selected grass and lawn substrates were determined. A statement about the suitability of the substrates for anaerobic digestion is made in this paper. The biogas potentials are between 325 and 720 standardized l per kg organic dry matter (l/kg ODM), depending on the sampling location, mowing time, grass species etc. For example, the biogas potentials for clippings from the dikes were in a range comparable with corn silage between 420 and 700 l/kg ODM. Additionally, the problem of seasonal accumulation of grass biomass including the influence of storage on the initial material is considered in this paper...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Grass</b> <b>clippings,</b> from mowed lawns are {{sometimes}} collected and used elsewhere as mulch. <b>Grass</b> <b>clippings</b> are dense {{and tend to}} mat down, so are mixed with tree leaves or rough compost to provide aeration and to facilitate their decomposition without smelly putrefaction.

40|$|A drenagem Ã uma etapa importante na construÃÃo de um gramado esportivo, auxiliando no desenvolvimento da grama e na utilizaÃÃo por parte dos usuÃrios. Para um projeto de drenagem, informaÃÃes sobre a sensibilidade da cultura ao estresse por excesso de Ãgua facilitarÃo nas tomadas de decisÃes quanto ao dimensionamento do projeto. Partindo da premissa de que o excesso de Ãgua prejudica o crescimento e desenvolvimento da cultura da grama e que os Ãndices Sum {{excess water}} (SEW 30) e Index day stress (IDS) sÃo sensÃveis Ãs variÃveis de desenvolvimento da cultura, objetivou-se com este estudo identificar a sensibilidade da cultura da grama bermuda ao excesso de Ãgua com base na anÃlise de variÃveis de desenvolvimento da cultura. O experimento foi conduzido com a grama bermuda (Cynodon spp.), durante trÃs meses, em um modelo fÃsico localizado no LaboratÃrio de HidrÃulica e IrrigaÃÃo do Departamento de Engenharia AgrÃcola da Universidade Federal do CearÃ (UFC). No local foram construÃdos tanques de alvenaria que medem 1, 5 m de altura, 2, 0 m de largura e 1, 5 m de comprimento, que permitem controlar o nÃvel do lenÃol freÃtico em diferentes posiÃÃes. Foi utilizado substrato Ã base de areia, {{conforme}} especificaÃÃes da United States Golf Association (USGA). O delineamento experimental utilizado foi inteiramente casualizado com cinco tratamentos e quatro repetiÃÃes. Os tratamentos consistiram em elevaÃÃes do lenÃol freÃtico, variando as profundidades entre 0, 05 m e 0, 20 m, realizadas quinzenalmente, com duraÃÃo de trÃs dias, alÃm do tratamento sem elevaÃÃo do lenÃol freÃtico. As variÃveis utilizadas para testar os tratamentos foram: comprimento de raiz, taxa de fotossÃntese, massa da matÃria seca de raÃzes, estolÃes, rizomas, colmos e folhas e massa seca das aparas de grama. Na anÃlise de variÃncia os tratamentos foram comparados pelo teste F, considerando-se um nÃvel mÃnimo de significÃncia de 5 % de probabilidade. Os resultados permitem concluir que os valores associados Ãs variÃveis analisadas demonstram decrÃscimos em seus rendimentos com o incremento no nÃvel de estresse por excesso de Ãgua; a cultura da grama bermuda mostra-se mais sensÃvel ao excesso de Ãgua no primeiro estÃdio de desenvolvimento e a taxa fotossintÃtica no tratamento com maior nÃvel de estresse, ou seja; lenÃol freÃtico a 0, 05 m da superfÃcie do solo decresceu em torno de 2 / 3 do valor para a condiÃÃo de ausÃncia do lenÃol freÃtico. The drainage {{is an important}} stage in building a filed sports turf helping {{in the development of}} grass and in use by the users. For a drainage project information on the sensitivity of culture to stress by excess water will facilitate making decisions as to the design of the project. Assuming that the excess water affect the growth and development of the culture of grass and that the indices SEW 30 and IDS are sensitive to the variables of development of the cultivation, the objective {{of this study was to}} identify the sensitivity of the culture of Bermuda grass to the excess of water based on the analysis of variables for crop development and stress treatments by excess water as referenced in the indices SEW 30 and IDS. The experiment was conducted for three months with the Bermuda grass (Cynodon spp.) in the area of the Laboratory of hydraulic and irrigation of the Department of Agricultural Engineering of Federal University of CearÃ (UFC). On the site were constructed tanks of masonry which measure 1. 5 m in height, 2. 0 m wide and 1. 5 m in length, which allows you to control the level in the groundwater in different positions. The soil mix used the base of sand as per specifications of the United States Golf Association (USGA). The experimental design was completely randomized with five treatments and four replications. The treatments consisted of six elevations in the groundwater, varying the depths between 0. 05 m and 0. 20 m, and carried out monthly, with a duration of three days and the treatment without elevation of the groundwater. The variables used to test the treatment was root length, photosynthesis rate, dry weight of roots, rhizomes, stolons, culms and leaves and dry weight of <b>clippings</b> <b>grass.</b> In the variance analysis the treatments was compared by F test, considering a minimum level of significance was 5 % probability. It was concluded that the values assigned to the variables analyzed showed decreases in their income with the increase in the stress level by excess water; The culture of bermudagrass was more sensitive to excess water in the first stage of development; and the photosynthetic rate at higher stress levels, decreases reaches approximately 2 / 3 of the value for the condition of no groundwater...|$|R
