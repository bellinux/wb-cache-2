40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to answer the {{question}} of whether earplugs provide sufficient protection in the exposure to impulse noise generated during metalworking processes. Material and Methods: The noise generated by die forging hammer and punching machine was characterized. Using an acoustic test fixture, noise parameters (LCpeak, LAmax) under 24 earplugs, foam, winged and no-roll, were measured. Octave band method was used to calculate values of LAeq under earplugs. Results: It was found that in the case of punching machine the <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> of A-weighted noise exposure level, normalized to an 8 -h working day (LEX, 8 h = 94. 8 dB) of noise present at the workstation, was exceeded, while in the case of die forging hammer both the <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> of this parameter (LEX, 8 h = 108. 3 dB) and the <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> of peak sound pressure level (LCpeak = 148. 9 dB) were exceeded. The assessment of noise parameters (LCpeak, LAmax, LAeq) under earplugs revealed that the noise attenuation can be insufficient, sufficient, or too high. Conclusions: Earplugs can be suitable hearing protection devices in metalworking processes. Of the 24 earplugs included in this study, 9 provided appropriate noise attenuation in the case of tested die forging hammer and 10 in the case of tested punching machine.

50|$|In {{the law of}} the European Union, {{indicative}} limit values, more exactly indicative occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> (IOELVs), are human exposure limits to hazardous substances specified by the Council of the European Union based on expert research and advice.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998, {{directive}} 80/1107/EEC was repealed {{and replaced}} by a new regime under the chemical agents directive (directive 98/24/EC). The directive defines occupational exposure limit value as [...] "the limit of the time-weighted average of the concentration of a chemical agent in the air within the breathing zone of a worker over a specified reference period." [...] Article 3 of the directive {{led to the creation}} of the Scientific Committee on Occupational <b>Exposure</b> <b>Limit</b> <b>Values</b> to advise the European Commission.

50|$|There {{are only}} a few ways to lower the {{severity}} and risk of damage from HAVS without complete engineering redesign on the operation of the tools. A few examples could be increasing the dampening through thicker gloves and increasing the trigger size of the tool to decrease the stress concentration of the vibrations on the contact area, but the best course of action would be to buy safer tools that vibrate less. These Exposure Action Values and <b>Exposure</b> <b>Limit</b> <b>Values</b> seem rather low, when compared to lab tested data, shown by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Power Tools Database. Just an example out of the database, the reciprocating saws look to have extremely violent vibrations with one of the saws vibrations reaching 50 m/s2 in one hand and over 35 m/s2 in the other.|$|E

While safety engineers worldwide are collaboratively working on instilling both an Exposure Action <b>Value</b> and an <b>Exposure</b> <b>Limit</b> <b>Value</b> similar to the occupational noise standards, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the only regulatory public safety administration in the United States, has yet to offer either official values in the U.S.|$|R

This makes managing the risk relatively straightforward.

5000|$|Although peer-reviewed health-based OELs are {{preferred}} {{for establishing}} safe levels of exposure or for implementing adequate controls to provide worker protection, {{the lack of}} publicly available OELs have led to other sources of safe levels to protect workers. Industrial or Occupational Hygienists are often {{on the front line}} of anticipating and recognizing the hazards of chemical exposure for workers, and must assess the risk of exposure through the use of OELs so that proper control strategies can be implemented to keep workers below the OEL values. In the absence of OELs however, {{there are a variety of}} tools that can and should be used to assess exposure potential of workers. The [...] "Hierarchy of OELs" [...] provides a continuum of occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> that allow assessment of the risk of exposure in order to apply adequate controls.Personal air sampling is routinely conducted on workers to determine whether exposures are acceptable or unacceptable. These samples are collected and analyzed using validated sampling and analytical methods.

30|$|At the EU level, two {{concepts}} for deriving occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> exist. The first being binding occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> (BOELVs) for which member states {{are obliged to}} derive national limit values equal to or lower than the BOELV [7, 8, 12]. For their derivation, toxicological information, socio-economic information and technical feasibility factors {{need to be taken}} into account [13]. The second set are the indicative occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> (IOELVs) [14 – 16] for which member states are obliged to derive national limit values that can either be higher or lower than these IOELVs. These limit values were based on consideration of evidence for an impact of the substance on health [13]; currently 5 BOELVs and 112 IOELVs have been set. For both sets of limits, the focus is on airborne exposure rather than dermal contact. The progress with the EU standards can be compared to historical national exposure limits. For example, in Germany, occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> for inhalation have been derived for 386 substances [17].|$|E
