2500|$|In 1868 James Clerk Maxwell had an {{improved}} zoetrope constructed. Instead of slits it used concave lenses with a focal length equaling {{the diameter of}} the cylinder. The virtual image was thus seen in the centre and appeared much more sharp and steady than in the original zoetrope. Maxwell drew several strips that mostly demonstrated subjects relating to physics, like the vibrations of a <b>harp</b> <b>string</b> or Helmholtz's vortex rings threading through each other. An article about the [...] "Zootrope perfectionné" [...] was published in French scientific magazine Le Cosmos in 1869, but the device was never marketed. Maxwell's original zoetrope and some strips are kept {{in the collection of the}} Cavendish Museum in Cambridge.|$|E
6000|$|I have no {{happiness}} in dreaming of Brycelinde; [...] Nor Avalon the grass green hollow, nor Joyous Isle, [...] Where one found Lancelot crazed and hid {{him for a}} while, [...] Nor Ulad when Naoise had thrown a sail upon the wind, [...] Nor lands that seem too dim to be burdens on the heart, [...] Land-under-Wave, where out of the moon's light and the sun's [...] Seven old sisters wind the threads of the long lived ones, [...] Land-of-the-Tower, where Aengus has thrown the gates apart, [...] And Wood-of-Wonders, where one kills an ox at dawn [...] To find it when night falls laid on a golden bier: [...] Therein are many queens like Branwen, and Guinivere; [...] And Niam, and Laban, and Fand, who could change to an otter or fawn [...] And the wood-woman whose lover was changed to a blue-eyed hawk; [...] And whether I go in my dreams by woodland, or dun, or shore, [...] Or on the unpeopled waves with kings to pull at the oar, [...] I hear the <b>harp</b> <b>string</b> praise them or hear their mournful talk. [...] Because of a story I heard under the thin horn [...] Of the third moon, that hung between the night and the day, [...] To dream of women whose beauty was folded in dismay, [...] Even in an old story, is a burden not to be borne.|$|E
