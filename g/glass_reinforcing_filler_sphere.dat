40|$|Diffusion of {{seawater}} in {{unsaturated polyester}} resin (UPR) and its <b>glass</b> fiber <b>reinforced</b> composite {{in the presence}} of titanium dioxide has been studied by sorption method. Incorporation of glass and TiO(2) to UPR alters the seawater diffusion process from Fickian to non-Fickian type. The dual mode sorption model is used to separate Fickian-controlled and relaxation-controlled diffusion in case of UPR-T, UPR-G, and UPR-GT. The presence of TiO(2) seems to stabilize UPR and its <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> samples but an increase in the rate of seawater diffusion is observed for these systems. The free volume determined from positron lifetime measurements support the diffusion data in these systems. Results further indicate that the contribution to diffusion in the later stages of sorption is due to the increased contribution from the interfaces. The plasticizing effect of TiO(2) is clearly seen even in the <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> composite.

40|$|Abstract: Composite {{materials}} are increasingly utilized in many civil engineering and medical {{applications such as}} conveying tubes and pipelines, making artificial human parts, dental applications, reinforcing structures, etc. The <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> composite {{is one of the}} most common composite that is used for its good mechanical properties and also its rationally low price. Polymeric resins such as epoxy are used as the constitutive material in producing <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> composites. In this research paper we improve the impact resistance of the glass-reinforced composite using Hycar reactive oligomer. Mechanical impact strength tests have been conducted using a notched sample. The obtained test results show that the impact resistance of Hycar modified glass-reinforced composite is enhanced by addition of the Hycar to the <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> composite. Moreover the glass transition temperature (T g) of the samples has been measured experimentally using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) instrument. The results of measuring T g however shows that these improvements in impact resistance of the composite material are accompanied with a slight reduction in the glass transition temperature of the modified composite samples. Moreover the damaged surfaces of fractured samples were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques.
