40|$|The art of personalised <b>e-advertising</b> {{relies on}} {{attracting}} the user‟s {{attention to the}} recommended product, {{as it relates to}} their taste, interest and data. Whilst in practice, companies attempt various forms of personalisation; research of personalised <b>e-advertising</b> is rare, and seldom routed on solid theory. Adaptive hypermedia (AH) techniques have contributed to the development of personalised tools for adaptive content delivery, mostly in the educational domain. This study explores the use of these theories and techniques in a specific field – adaptive e-advertisements. This is accomplished firstly by structuring a theoretical framework that roots adaptive hypermedia into the domain of <b>e-advertising</b> and then uses this theoretical framework as the base for implementing and evaluating an adaptive e-advertisement system called “MyAds”. The novelty of this approach relies on a systematic design and evaluation based on adaptive hypermedia taxonomy. In particular, this thesis uses a user centric methodology to design and evaluate the proposed approach. It also reports on evaluations that investigated users‟ opinions on the appropriate design of MyAds. Another set of evaluations reported on users‟ perceptions of the implemented system, allowing for a reflection on the users‟ acceptance level of <b>e-advertising.</b> The results from both implicit and explicit feedback indicated that users found the MyAds system acceptable and agreed that the implemented user modelling and AH features within the system contributed to achieving acceptance, within their e-advertisement experience due to the different personalisation methods. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} examines consumer {{attitudes towards}} four SUb-types of interactive digital advertising: internet-based e-and email advertising, and mobile-phone-based SMS- and MMS-type advertising. The differences in attitudes among these four sub-types of interactive digital advertising are also compared. Data are collected from three universities in Taiwan. Data analysis extracts three attitudinal forms (common factors) towards interactive digital advertising, namely, 'informative', 'entertaining' and 'irritating'. Consumer attitudinal forms towards <b>e-advertising</b> and MMS-type m-advertising are both similar and positive (i. e. informative and less irritating and entertaining). Their attitudinal forms towards email advertising and SMS-type in-advertising are less positive (more irritating and less informative and entertaining). Furthermore, the three attitudinal forms towards the four SUb-types of interactive digital advertising are compared. Consumer 'informative' and 'entertaining' attitudinal forms towards <b>e-advertising</b> and MMS-type m-advertising are similar, while their attitudinal forms towards email advertising and SMS-type m-advertising are equal and lower than towards {{the previous two}} sub-types of interactive digital advertising. As for the 'irritating' attitudinal form, consumers feel more 'irritated' towards email advertising and SMS-type m-advertising, while their attitudinal forms towards <b>e-advertising</b> and MMS-type m-advertising are equal and less irritated...|$|E
40|$|The paper’s aim is {{that how}} the {{electronic}} system is able to transmit the message and is considered as an advertising tool, influencing factors on consumer’s behavioral response should be identified {{in order to use}} this media desirably, effectively, and utilize the <b>e-advertising</b> advantages to satisfy consumers’ needs. This is a research an applied research and a descriptive one with field studies. There are some casual relationships among the research variables. A questionnaire is used to collect data. This study aims to designing, validating, and evaluating a model which explains the influence of <b>e-advertising</b> on consumer behavior as well as providing strengths and weaknesses of the model and suggesting solutions to enhance strengths and converting weaknesses to strengths. In this paper, capabilities of internet advertising are examined in a form of 14 content and communicate motives via a leading process (cognition, affection, and attitude) on consumer’s behavioral response (image and mentality, intention and desire, testing, purchasing and consuming) as “an <b>e-advertising</b> model” in Tehran Refah Chain Stores. Results show a suitability of the fitted structural model. The above mentioned company, however, should improve its website’s capability in content and communicate motives. In this way, internet advertisings of Refah Chain Store’s are able to have a desirable effectiveness in order to lead the consumer behavior. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>E-advertising</b> is a multi-billion dollar {{industry}} that has shown exponential growth {{in the last few}} years. However, although the number of users accessing the Internet increases, users don’t respond positively to adverts. Adaptive <b>e-advertising</b> may be the key to ensuring effectiveness of the ads reaching their target. Moreover, social networks are good sources of user information and can be used to extract user behaviour and characteristics for presentation of personalized advertising. Here we present a two-sided study based on two questionnaires, one directed to Internet users and the other to businesses. Our study shows that businesses agree that personalized advertising is the best way for the future, to maximize effectiveness and profit.

40|$|Adaptation and {{personalisation}} {{is aimed}} at improving the user experience in e-systems. Personalisation was initially applied {{in the fields of}} distance learning and web-based educational systems. Adaptation can be also used in <b>e-advertising,</b> to increase customer satisfaction and encourage repeat visits to websites. Several models/frameworks have been designed for adaptation, for instance AHAM, LAOS, AdRosa, and MyAds. Many systems have been developed based on these frameworks. Most previous models/frameworks were primarily designed for personalised educational experience and were aimed at standalone systems, which cannot be (easily) integrated into existing websites in a lightweight manner. In addition, some of them are used in the portal model of advertising, since they match the interests of the publisher and the advertiser. The aim of this work is to overcome the limitations and weaknesses of these models and systems to deliver adaptive advertising. This work firstly attempts to support and facilitate the integration between adaptive systems and business websites. It also introduces a method to control and adapt advertisements located and owned by businesses. This thesis further proposes a generalised model, the Layered Adaptive Advertising Integration (LAAI), as the starting point for the development of an adaptive advertisement system. In a second stage, it presents a study that assesses the effectiveness of a system (AEADS) based on this model, via a trial run of a model prototype with users (both customers and business owners). In a third stage, social networks are used as inputs for the user model of customers, to enhance the efficiency of acquiring user information, as an addition to the user registration process. Furthermore, social interactions, such as the facility to use “like”, are added to the user model, and the delivery process has the ability to apply actions based on this data. Finally, an evaluation of the whole system proposed is conducted, with business owners and Internet users alike...|$|E
40|$|Background: From a {{marketing}} perspective, personalisation of online advertising {{is a very}} promising way of reaching customers and will play an increasingly {{important role in the}} future. Personalisation on the Internet is far more widespread than in the offline world and can cover all online interactions {{when it comes to the}} question of what information to personalise. It directly relates to the issue of privacy of personal data and creates a need for a privacy policy that clarifies the relation between personalisation and privacy. Problem: Personalisation represents one of the main advantages of the Internet and al-lows marketers to target individual customers directly and adapt their marketing communications to the user’s preferences and needs. On the one hand, personalisation can give customers access to better service, products and communication and provides an experience of one. On the other, privacy issues related to the Internet and personalisation in particular are a contemporary topic of growing interest. Internet users are increasingly aware of the fact that websites collect information about them and their privacy concerns are growing. Personal information is necessary for personalising advertisements. Therefore, this development contradicts the customer’s increased demand for personalisation and the trend towards narrowly targeted marketing. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to explore if personalised online advertising could be perceived as a danger to customer’s privacy or on the other hand, facilitate the purchase decision process. Method: In order to answer the purpose and the research questions, a survey has been conducted with 152 JIBS students asking them about their opinion on <b>e-advertising</b> and their fears about it. After the questionnaires had been collected, different analysis such as univariate analysis and bivariate analysis has been done using SPSS. Conclusions: In summary it can be said that the respondent’s general perception of personalised e-ads is negative; they do not believe that they make shopping easier and they see a danger for their privacy in how companies collect the customer’s information and use it...|$|E
