40|$|<b>Darcy</b> <b>s</b> <b>law</b> is {{a widely}} used model and the limit of its {{validity}} is fairly well known. When the flow is sufficiently slow and the porosity relatively homogeneous and low, <b>Darcy</b> <b>s</b> <b>law</b> is the homogenized equation arising from the Stokes and Navier- Stokes equations and depends on a single effective parameter (the absolute permeability). However when the model is extended to multiphase flows, the assumptions are much more restrictive and less realistic. Therefore it is often {{used in conjunction with}} empirical models (such as relative permeability and capillary pressure curves), derived usually from phenomenological speculations and experimental data fitting. In this work, we present the results of a Bayesian calibration of a two-phase flow model, using high-fidelity DNS numerical simulation (at the pore-scale) in a realistic porous medium. These reference results have been obtained from a Navier-Stokes solver coupled with an explicit interphase-tracking scheme. The Bayesian inversion is performed on a simplified 1 D model in Matlab by using adaptive spectral method. Several data sets are generated and considered to assess the validity of this 1 D model...|$|E
40|$|I using quasilneariza-Weyman, D., 1973. Measurements of the {{downslope}} flow {{of water}} in a soil. J. Hydro!. 20 : 267 - 288. Measurements have been made of unsaturated and saturated lateral soil water flow on a convex hil-slope with a good soil cover and impermeable bedrock during natural rainstorms. The hydraulics of flow are examined in detail with particular reference {{to the role of}} breaks in vertical permeabilty, the change from saturated to unsaturated flow and the velocity of flow. In this instance, after rainfall slope flow is dominated by vertical unsaturated movement towards the profie base. Preceding upslope moisture gra-dients result in the growth of a zone of soil saturation upwards from the slope base: Slope discharge through the Band B/C horizons, is related to the form of the saturation zone, within which flow is lateral according to <b>Darcy</b> <b>s</b> <b>law.</b> The time required for vertical percolation and the low hydraulic conductivity of the lower soil horizons result in a hilslope hydrograph which is delayed and attenuated and cannot be regarded as storm flow. During drainage the saturation zone contracts and is replaced by a lateral un-saturated flow system at the profie base which supplies discharge from the B/C horizon for up to 42 days without further recharge. It is concluded that, in general, either distinct soil horizons or impermeable bedrock are essential for the initiation of lateral flow. Saturated flow is likely to dominate hilslope hydro-graphs through non-capilary pore spaces but these may be integrated to the point where <b>Darcy</b> <b>s</b> <b>law</b> stil holds. Although lateral soil water flow must be a widespread phenomenon, it is unlikely to provide storm runoff to the stream unless saturated conditions are generated within the organic horizons or flow within the lower soil horizons is dominated by non-Darcian flow through non-capilary spaces in the soil...|$|E
40|$|EOS 7 C is a TOUGH 2 module for {{multicomponent}} gas mixtures in {{the systems}} methane carbon dioxide (CH 4 -CO 2) or methane-nitrogen (CH 4 -N 2) {{with or without}} an aqueous phase and H 2 O vapor. EOS 7 C uses a cubic equation of state and an accurate solubility formulation along with a multiphase <b>Darcy</b> <b>s</b> <b>Law</b> to model flow and transport of gas and aqueous phase mixtures {{over a wide range}} of pressures and temperatures appropriate to subsurface geologic carbon sequestration sites and natural gas reservoirs. EOS 7 C models supercritical CO 2 and subcritical CO 2 as a non-condensible gas, hence EOS 7 C does not model the transition to liquid or solid CO 2 conditions. The components modeled in EOS 7 C are water, brine, non-condensible gas, gas tracer, methane, and optional heat. The non-condensible gas (NCG) can be selected by the user to be CO 2 or N 2. The real gas properties module has options for Peng-Robinson, Redlich-Kwong, or Soave-Redlich-Kwong equations of state to calculate gas mixture density, enthalpy departure, and viscosity. Partitioning of the NCG and CH 4 between the aqueous and gas phases is calculated using a very accurate chemical equilibrium approach. Transport of the gaseous and dissolved components is by advection and Fickian molecular diffusion. We present instructions for use and example problems to demonstrate the accuracy and practical application of EOS 7 C...|$|E
40|$|Packed bed {{reactors}} are compact, require {{minimum power}} and maintenance to operate, and are highly reliable. These features make this technology a leading candidate {{as a potential}} unit operation in support of long duration human space exploration. On earth, this type of reactor accounts for approximately 80 % of all the reactors used in the chemical process industry today. Development of this technology for space exploration is truly crosscutting with many other potential applications (e. g., in-situ chemical processing of planetary materials and transport of nutrients through soil). NASA is developing an ISS experiment to address this technology with particular focus on water reclamation and air revitalization. Earlier research and development efforts funded by NASA have resulted in two hydrodynamic models which require validation with appropriate instrumentation in an extended microgravity environment. The first model developed by Motil et al., (2003) {{is based on a}} modified Ergun equation. This model was demonstrated at moderate gas and liquid flow rates, but extension to the lower flow rates expected in many advanced life support systems must be validated. The other model, developed by Guo et al., (2004) is based on <b>Darcy</b> <b>s</b> (1856) <b>law</b> for two-phase flow. This model has been validated for a narrow range of flow parameters indirectly (without full instrumentation) and included test points where the flow was not fully developed. The flight experiment presented will be designed with removable test sections to test the hydrodynamic models. The experiment will provide flexibility to test additional beds with different types of packing in the future. One initial test bed is based on the VRA (Volatile Removal Assembly), a packed bed reactor currently on ISS whose behavior in micro-gravity is not fully understood. Improving the performance of this system through an accurate model will increase our ability to purify water in the space environment...|$|R

40|$|We {{simulate}} {{an earthquake}} rupture through a 3 - D Finite Difference algorithm using the traction at split - nodes fault boundary condition. The dynamic rupture propagation {{is governed by}} an assigned constitutive law, which controls the breakdown processes within the cohesive zone. Our numerical procedure allows the use either of time - and slip - weakening or rate - and state - dependent (R & S) friction laws. Seismic slip on faults produces temperature perturbations. Fault heating {{is controlled by the}} mechanical properties of the fault surface and by the rheological properties of the gouge layer. We model the temperature evolution on the fault through the heat flow equation and we couple these thermal variations with the fluid pressure changes by using the <b>Darcy</b> <b>s</b> <b>law</b> for fluid flow in porous media and the continuity equation of fluid mass in a solid. We assume that the increase of temperature does not change the adopted R & S constitutive parameters during the dynamic instability. In a first set of simulations, we consider a constant porosity within the slip zone and we model the temporal variations of effective normal stress by considering the Terzaghi law. Subsequently, we use the evolution equation for the state variable proposed by Linker and Dieterich (1992), which accounts for normal stress variations. In this way we model the state variable evolution {{as a function of the}} constitutive parameters and the effective normal stress changes. Finally, we link this constitutive model with the evolution law for porosity proposed by Segall and Rice (1995). The goal of this study is to investigate dynamic fault weakening caused by shear heating and thermal pressurization of pore fluids. We show how these phenomena may complicate the dynamic traction evolution and affect dynamic fault strength. Our simulations reveal that the effect of frictional heating and temperature increase strongly depend on the thickness of the slip zone. Thus, our 3 - D simulations confirm that thermal pressurization is a viable mechanism to explain earthquake ruptures...|$|E
