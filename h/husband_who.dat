40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} factors affecting domestic violence risk behaviors among Thai Muslim married couples in Satun Province. The data were collected from 1, 920 wives as representatives of families, and analyzed using the R program to find out frequencies, percentages, chi-square test, odds ratios, and logistic coefficients.
