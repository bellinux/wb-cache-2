500|$|Returning to the West End, Gielgud {{starred in}} JBPriestley's The Good Companions, adapted {{for the stage}} by the author and Edward Knoblock. The {{production}} ran from May 1931 for 331 performances, and Gielgud described it as his first real taste of commercial success. He played Inigo Jollifant, a young schoolmaster who abandons teaching to join a travelling theatre troupe. This crowd-pleaser drew disapproval from the more austere reviewers, who felt Gielgud should be doing something more demanding, but he found playing a conventional juvenile lead had challenges of its own and helped him improve his technique. During {{the run of the}} play he made another film, Insult (1932), a melodrama about the French Foreign Legion, and he starred in a cinema version of The Good Companions in 1933, with Jessie Matthews. A letter to a friend reveals Gielgud's view of film acting: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> my doing Inigo in the film of The Good Companions, which appals my soul but appeals to my pocket." [...] In his first volume of memoirs, published in 1939, Gielgud devoted two pages to describing the things about filming that he detested. Unlike his contemporaries Richardson and Laurence Olivier, he made few films until after the Second World War, and did not establish himself as a prominent film actor until many years after that. As he put it in 1994, [...] "I was stupid enough to toss my head and stick to the stage while watching Larry and Ralph sign lucrative Korda contracts." ...|$|E

2500|$|By 1937, in {{tune with}} the National Christian Party regime, Cantacuzino had embraced eugenics, racism, and antisemitism. At a meeting in Cluj, she {{proposed}} the introduction of legislation banning all [...] "foreigners" [...] and minorities from marrying Romanian state employees, as well as 10-year reviews for all Romanian citizenship applications. Additionally, she and the GFR envisaged state bonuses for [...] "eugenic" [...] marriages between full-blooded Romanian youths. Meanwhile, her connections in the international feminist movement became alarmed by the growth of antisemitic violence. In a December 1933 letter to Cantacuzino, Cécile Brunschvicg inquired: [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> terrible antisemitic campaigns in Romania, and of the development of a Nazi spirit in your country. Is this true? [...] It would really be a deplorable if [...] spirit were to win over a Latin country that is so sane, and so very close to our hearts." ...|$|E
2500|$|NME {{magazine}} {{confirmed that}} {{after the release of}} the song [...] "Heavy in Your Arms" [...] for , lead singer Florence Welch entered the studio for a two-week session to record with producer Paul Epworth, with whom she worked on the band's debut album, Lungs. She said that the two recordings that came out of that session were inspired by science because [...] "a lot of her family are doctors or trying to become doctors, so much of her conversations are fixated on medical stuff." [...] In an interview with the Gibson website on 17 February 2011, guitarist Rob Ackroyd stated, [...] "Work on the second album has begun with Paul Epworth and there <b>is</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> booking out Abbey Road for a month in April/May to record." [...] In June 2011, Epworth told BBC 6 Music that the album would probably be finished [...] "by the end of July" [...] and described the sound as [...] "a lot less indie and lot more soulful". He also indicated that there were 16 songs up for inclusion on the album, but that this would be reduced upon the time of release. Pitchfork confirmed on 23 August 2011 that the album was produced solely by Epworth. On 12 September 2011, Canadian radio broadcaster Alan Cross revealed that Florence and the Machine's second album would be titled Ceremonials. He also commented on the album by saying, [...] "I've heard a little more than half the record and it is big, soulful and powerful. Think Adele or Tori Amos but with some serious Kate Bush DNA, especially with the rhythm section." ...|$|E
