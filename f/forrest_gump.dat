5|$|<b>Forrest</b> <b>Gump</b> is a 1994 American comedy-drama film {{based on}} the 1986 novel {{of the same name}} by Winston Groom. The film was {{directed}} by Robert Zemeckis and stars Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field. The story depicts several decades in the life of <b>Forrest</b> <b>Gump,</b> a slow-witted but kind-hearted, good-natured and athletically prodigious man from Alabama, who witnesses, and in some cases influences, some of the defining events of {{the latter half of the}} 20th century in the United States; more specifically, the period between Forrest's birth in 1944 and 1982. The film differs substantially from Winston Groom's novel, including Gump's personality and several events that were depicted.|$|E

50|$|Jay Sacher writes: From high to low, the {{memorial}} is cultural shorthand for both American ideals and 1960s radicalism.

5|$|Some {{commentators}} see {{the conservative}} readings of <b>Forrest</b> <b>Gump</b> as indicants {{of the death}} of irony in American culture. Vivian Sobchack notes that the film's humor and irony relies on the assumption of the audience's historical (self-) consciousness.|$|E

500|$|Critics have {{compared}} Gump with various characters and people including Huckleberry Finn, Bill Clinton, and Ronald Reagan. Peter Chomo writes that Gump {{acts as a}} [...] "social mediator and {{as an agent of}} redemption in divided times". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Gump [...] "everything we admire in the American character – honest, brave, and loyal with a heart of gold." [...] The New York Times reviewer Janet Maslin called Gump a [...] "hollow man" [...] who is [...] "self-congratulatory in his blissful ignorance, warmly embraced as the embodiment of absolutely nothing." [...] Marc Vincenti of Palo Alto Weekly called the character [...] "a pitiful stooge taking the pie of life in the face, thoughtfully licking his fingers." [...] Bruce Kawin and Gerald Mast's textbook on film history notes that <b>Forrest</b> <b>Gump's</b> dimness was a metaphor for glamorized nostalgia in that he represented a blank slate by which the Baby Boomer generation projected their memories of those events.|$|R
500|$|Various interpretations {{have been}} {{suggested}} for the feather present at the opening and conclusion of the film.

The randomness of experience?" [...] Hanks interpreted the feather as: [...] "Our destiny is only defined by {{how we deal with}} the chance elements to our life and that's kind of the embodiment of the feather as it comes in. Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications that are really huge." [...] Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: [...] "It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there. Was it planned or was it just perchance?" [...] Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: [...] "It can mean so many things to so many different people." ...|$|R

5|$|The film {{is based}} on the 1986 novel by Winston Groom.

5|$|Winston Groom {{was paid}} $350,000 for the {{screenplay}} rights to his novel <b>Forrest</b> <b>Gump</b> and was contracted for a 3percent {{share of the}} film's net profits. However, Paramount and the film's producers did not pay him, using Hollywood accounting to posit that the blockbuster film lost money. Tom Hanks, by contrast, contracted for a {{percent share of the}} film's gross receipts instead of a salary, and he and director Zemeckis each received $40million. Additionally, Groom was not mentioned once in any of the film's six Oscar-winner speeches.|$|E

5|$|While The Shawshank Redemption {{received}} positive reviews on its release, {{particularly for}} its {{story and the}} performances of Robbins and Freeman, it was a box office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from films such as Pulp Fiction and <b>Forrest</b> <b>Gump,</b> to the general unpopularity of prison films, lack of female characters, and even the title, which {{was considered to be}} confusing for audiences. However, it went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven Academy Award nominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased the film's box office gross to $58.3 million.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{the city was}} {{considered}} as a site for the film The Squaw Man by Jesse Lasky and Cecil B. DeMille, but was abandoned in favor of Hollywood. Several recent movies have been filmed, at least in part, in Flagstaff. A small scene in Midnight Run was filmed in Flagstaff at the train depot, the city was also referenced in the film. Several of the running scenes in <b>Forrest</b> <b>Gump</b> were filmed {{in and around the}} area, including a memorable scene where Forrest is seen jogging in downtown Flagstaff and gives inspiration to a bumper sticker designer ("Shit happens"). Parts of 2007 Academy Award winner Little Miss Sunshine were filmed at the junction of I-40 and I-17 in Flagstaff, and Terminal Velocity was partially filmed in the city.|$|E
5|$|Produced on {{a budget}} of $55million, <b>Forrest</b> <b>Gump</b> opened in 1,595theaters in its first weekend of {{domestic}} release, earning $24,450,602. Motion picture business consultant and screenwriter Jeffrey Hilton suggested to producer Wendy Finerman to double the P (film marketing budget) based on his viewing of an early print of the film. The budget was immediately increased, per his advice. The film placed first in the weekend's box office, narrowly beating The Lion King, which was in its fourth week of release. For the first ten weeks of its release, the film held the number one position at the box office. The film remained in theaters for 42weeks, earning $329.7million in the United States and Canada, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film at that time (behind only E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, , and Jurassic Park). Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 78.5 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.|$|E
5|$|Darabont looked {{initially}} {{at some of}} {{his favorite}} actors like Gene Hackman and Robert Duvall {{for the role of}} Andy Dufresne, but they were unavailable; Clint Eastwood and Paul Newman were also considered. Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, and Kevin Costner were offered, and passed on the role —Hanks due to his starring role in <b>Forrest</b> <b>Gump,</b> and Costner because he had the lead in Waterworld. Johnny Depp, Nicolas Cage, and Charlie Sheen were also considered for the role at different stages. Cruise attended table readings of the script, but refused to work for the inexperienced Darabont. Darabont said he cast Robbins after seeing his performance in the 1990 psychological horror Jacob's Ladder. When Robbins was cast he insisted that Darabont use experienced cinematographer Roger Deakins, who had worked with him on The Hudsucker Proxy. To prepare for the role, Robbins observed caged animals at a zoo, spent an afternoon in solitary confinement, spoke with prisoners and guards, and had his arms and legs shackled for a few hours.|$|E
