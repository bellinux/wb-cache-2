50|$|Other {{enhancements}} of {{the expansion}} included <b>dyeable</b> armor, {{an increase in the}} number of bank slots available for characters, a new guild management system, a new armor slot called Charms, and a new overhead mapping system which allowed players to customize maps. The zones were intended for mid-level adventurers between levels 36-60 and were generally received as very uninspired and added little to the lore of Norrath, however the guild management, extra bank slots, trading between characters utility and mapping tools are considered vital, and dyeing of armor is very popular.|$|E
50|$|In a {{reactive}} dye, a chromophore (an atom {{or group}} whose presence {{is responsible for}} the colour of a compound) contains a substituent that reacts with the substrate. Reactive dyes have good fastness properties owing to the bonding that occurs during dyeing. Reactive dyes are most commonly used in dyeing of cellulose like cotton or flax, but also wool is <b>dyeable</b> with reactive dyes. Reactive dyeing is the most important method for the coloration of cellulosic fibres. Reactive dyes can also be applied on wool and nylon; in the latter case they are applied under weakly acidic conditions. Reactive dyes have a low utilization degree compared to other types of dyestuff, since the functional group also bonds to water, creating hydrolysis.|$|E

40|$|In this research, a novel {{approach}} has been proposed to remove stain problem from blended fabrics as an alternative option with traditional reduction clearing process. For this purpose, cationic <b>dyeable</b> polyester and cotton blended fabrics were dyed as traditional technique based on formulations approach and the colour strength (K/S), dye uptake (%) and the whiteness index properties were evaluated. The results of color strength indicated that dye was more uniformly absorbed by the blended fabric compared to the untreated fabric. In addition, when untreated fabric was dyed {{in the presence of}} a leveling agent (Lyogen DFTN), the K/S and levelness of dye uptake (%) values were enhanced. Finally, very less staining was observed that proved by CIE Whiteness Index values and indicates that formulation (F-IV) has more beneficial to reduce staining from Cotton/CDPET blended fabric (65 / 35) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Polymer nano{{composite}}s are new {{classes of}} composite materials derived from nanoparticles {{with at least}} one dimension in the nanometric range. Polypropylene nanocomposites have attracted a considerable interest due to its most widely used and fastest growing classes of thermoplastic polymer with low cost and low density. However, a problem associated with polypropylene is its dyeability. There have been many attempts by polymer and textile chemists for finding solutions for producing <b>dyeable</b> polypropylene. Chemical structure of nanoclay particles can provide dye site in nanocomposites Polypropylene /Nanofil, a natural montmorillonite modified with benzyl tallow dimethyl ammonium salt composites were prepared (at different ratios) by melt mixing and pressing. Maleic anhydride-modified polypropylene (PP-g-MA) was used as a compatibilizer. SEM images show that clays were dispersed in to the PP matrix in the form of large and small non isometric aggregates. However, the size of aggregates in the sample with 2 wt % nanoclay and 4 wt % PP-g-MA (PP 24 I) was larger. Thermal properties were not affected much but the crystallinity percentage and mechanical properties reduce slightly. Films could be dyed with a dispersed dye with acceptable was fastness and the shade changes with changing the clay content...|$|E

40|$|The present {{experimental}} dissertation {{covers the}} topic of transplanting collagen foils as carrier for cells into the subretinal space as a substitute of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) as a curative therapy for age-related macula degeneration (AMD). For this therapy, the biocompatibility and viability of collagen foils as scaffolds for RPE-Cells in the subretinal space of rabbit eyes was evaluated. The series of experiments included a total of 12 animals with one operated eye each. ARPE- 19 cells were cultivated on collagen foils, which have been stained with the fluorescing dye DTAF. After accessing the operating area via pars plana vitrectomy, a bleb was created by subretinally injecting balanced salt solution. Using a retinotomy on the ablated retina, the collagen foil was transplanted into the subretinal space. The observation period varied between 3 to 35 days. The enucleated rabbit eyes were evaluated both macroscopically and microscopically. After processing the histological slices with paraffin, the morphological examination was done natively, by using fluorescing light and {{with the aid of}} HE-staining. Being easily <b>dyeable</b> with DTAF, the sheet proved to be sturdy before and after cultivation, as well as during cutting and transplanting. Postoperative, the transplanted sheets with ARPE- 19 showed minor to none degradation after 2 weeks. Partial degradation was detectable after 3 weeks, almost complete degradation after 5 weeks. Up to 2 weeks after transplanting there was no gliotic or fibrotic reaction present in the surrounding tissue. After 3 weeks an increase of cells within the area of the degradation process could be witnessed while the retina remained intact. During the following period a reduction of outer photoreceptor segments and a narrowing of the nuclear layer were detectable. The collagen foils proved to be a reliable carrier for ARPE- 19 cells during the scope of this work, specifically standing out by its specific material characteristics which, while allowing for easy handling, fast degradation when cultivated and high biocompatibility in the subretinal space of the rabbit eye, also did not trigger a toxic or rejection reaction...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is mainly {{directed}} at achieving high fixation efficiency of reactive dyes on cotton in order to solve the remaining problems {{with the use of}} this type of dyes, e. g. the necessity of using expensive and time-consuming wash off procedure and of using high concentration of electrolyte to exhaust the dyebath. A number of ways to modify cotton have been sought to achieve the above objectives. Modification of cotton with a polyamide epichlorohydrin (PAE) resin and its derivatives was extensively studied; three simple pretreatment methods have been proposed and mechanistic implications are also discussed. Light fastness of the dyeings produced on cotton modified with polymeric compounds was compared to that achieved on cotton modified with low molecular weight compounds. It is concluded that reduction of light fastness of reactive dyeings always occurs on the former polymer modified substrate whilst there is no such problem with the dyeings on the latter substrate. Modification of cotton with a specially synthesized low molecular weight compound, 1, 1 -dimethyl- 3 -hydroxyl- 1 -azetidinium chloride (DMAC), and a commercially available compound, Glytac A, were carried out and the dyeability of the subsequent substrate was studied. The practical importance of these methods and the mechanism of covalent bond formation when using reactive dyes on these substrate are discussed. A systematic study of introducing different amino groups into cotton via reaction of cotton with N-methylol acrylamide followed by amination with different amines was undertaken and the dyeing behaviour of reactive dyes on the substrate produced was evaluated. An unusual reaction was observed when further treating cotton which had been pre-esterified with chloropropionyl chloride (CPC) in an aqueous solution of amines. Amination under severe conditions led to substrates which are <b>dyeable</b> with reactive dyes with good fastness properties but amination under much milder conditions produced substrates which gave the subsequent dyeings of poor wash fastness. A method to determine the chlorine content in CPC cotton by ion-exchange chromatography is discussed. An alternative way to achieve dye-fibre covalent bonding was proposed: cotton was activated first and then dyed with alkyl-amino dyes. The ways of cotton activation, the methods to prepare alkyl-amino dyes and activation agents are discussed. This approach not only imparts high efficiency to the fibre-dye reaction but also avoids the problem of dye hydrolysis. The present study has thus far produced six papers which have been published {{during the course of this}} project.
