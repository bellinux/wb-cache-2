40|$|Ports are {{civil works}} {{which have a}} major {{societal}} and economic importance. Quay structures are infrastructural elements of primary significance for the functioning of a port system. The ability to economically design quay structures with sufficient seismic resistance is therefore of great importance when situated {{in areas that are}} prone to earthquakes. Conventional seismic design is force-based i. e. that structures are designed to have sufficient capacity to withstand a pseudo-static seismic design force. This methodology is associated with no insight in the performance of the structure when exceeding the pseudo-static limit equilibrium state and uneconomic design due to the demand that the structure can resist a very high seismic design force without deforming. A more advanced alternative is Performance-Based Design (PBD) methodology. In this methodology the key design parameters for the seismic performance of structures are stress states and deformations of soil and structure, rather than just a seismic design force. Furthermore it recognizes that varying amounts of permanent deformations associated with different degrees of (repairable) damage are allowable. The present study is embedded in the topic of performance-based seismic design of quay structures. Typical quay types are gravity-based quay walls, sheet pile quay walls and pile-deck structures. The observed trend in seismic quay design is that gravity and sheet pile type structures (i. e. retaining walls) are associated with areas with zero to low seismicity while pile-deck structures are generally the preferred solution in areas with higher seismicity. This can be explained by more favourable seismic performance (i. e. more deformation capacity) of pile-deck structures compared to retaining walls. In line with this trend it is found that PBD methodology is developed to significant lesser extent for retaining walls (especially anchored sheet pile walls) than for pile-deck structures. Therefore the present study focuses on performance-based seismic design of anchored sheet pile quay walls. In the seismic design methodology there are generally three levels of seismic analysis available, i. e. simplified analysis (pseudo-static), simplified dynamic analysis and dynamic analysis. Simplified analysis of anchored sheet pile quay walls is associated with conventional design methodology. Simplified dynamic analysis can be used to obtain a first estimate of permanent-displacement of a structure after exceeding limit equilibrium, based on an assumed failure mode. This type of analysis has to be made more suitable for anchored sheet pile quay walls. In dynamic analysis the seismic behaviour of a structure can be simulated by means of finite element software. Experience has shown that it is desirable to consider sheet pile quay walls in a less conservative way in (preliminary) seismic design for which pseudo-static methodology is commonly applied. Therefore the general objective of the present study is to propose improvements on (simplified) seismic design methodologies for anchored sheet pile quay walls by considering deformation behaviour. For this purpose a research methodology is developed in which pseudo-static, permanent-displacement and FE analysis are employed, calibrated with an experimental reference case that considers a typical anchored sheet pile quay wall. The reference case is taken from a conference paper. It reports on a shake table test under centrifugal gravity which is performed on a scale model of an <b>existing</b> sheet pile <b>quay</b> wall with a batter pile anchor. The quay is situated in homogeneous soil that consists of coarse densified sand. Due to the soil condition liquefaction effects are prevented. Sequential seismic loading of increasing severity is applied during the shake table testing. Measurement results that are reported in the reference case paper comprise bending moments in the sheet pile wall, normal forces in the anchor rod and horizontal displacements of the sheet pile wall. For simplified analysis a calibrated D-SHEET PILING model of the reference case anchored sheet pile quay wall is created. Through an iterative pseudo-static calculation procedure in which D-SHEET PILING and reference case dynamic bending moment results are fitted, it is attempted to find a deformation-based seismic load reduction for structural forces in the sheet pile wall that can be applied in pseudo-static design methodology. For simplified dynamic analysis an analytical limit equilibrium model is developed, based on the failure behaviour of the reference case. The goal of this model is that it can compute the critical acceleration of the anchored quay structure and estimate the sheet pile forces at this critical state. These abilities are validated with PLAXIS 2 D and checked with the reference case measurements respectively. Six accelerograms in the reference case soil column, obtained with equivalent linear site-response analysis (with SHAKE 2000), are combined with the computed critical acceleration for permanent-displacement (sliding-block) analysis. For dynamic analysis a calibrated PLAXIS 2 D model of the reference case anchored sheet pile quay wall is created. Dynamic performance of the PLAXIS 2 D model is validated with SHAKE 2000 by comparing site-response analysis results of both models. Pseudo-static and pseudo-dynamic calculations are applied to obtain the critical acceleration. Dynamic calculations with six bedrock motions are carried out to simulate the reference case experiment. PLAXIS 2 D calculation results are used to validate simplified and simplified dynamic analysis results and to gain insight in the seismic failure behaviour of the anchored sheet pile quay wall. Approaches for (simplified) performance-based seismic analysis of a typical anchored sheet pile quay wall are proposed {{as a result of the}} research. For pseudo-static methodology a deformation-based seismic load reduction for structural forces in the sheet pile wall is proposed. For the present reference case it is concluded that a reduction in the range of 45 % to 50 % is allowable. For simplified dynamic analysis a limit equilibrium model is proposed to compute the critical acceleration of the present quay structure and to estimate sheet pile forces at this critical state. It is concluded that the ability of the limit equilibrium model is satisfactory. Although subjected to uncertainty, permanent-displacement analysis results indicate that the sliding-block analysis, originally developed for embankments, is possibly not suitable for anchored sheet pile quay walls. For dynamic analysis it is concluded that PLAXIS 2 D is able to compute the reference case failure behaviour reasonably well, despite some computational setbacks. Complementary is the conclusion that PLAXIS 2 D pseudo-static approach proves to be suitable to determine the critical acceleration of an anchored sheet pile structure in contrast to pseudo-dynamic approach which appears less suitable for that matter. In addition the performance-based design principle is linked to the present study so that an idea about the seismic performance limits of anchored sheet pile quay walls in quantitative terms can be provided. As a result of the present study findings it is recommended to perform more extensive research on the ability of permanent-displacement analysis to evaluate the amount of sliding displacement of an anchored sheet pile quay wall. In line with this recommendation it is found that further research on site-response analysis is desirable in the application of simplified dynamic and dynamic analysis. In general it is recommended to create more seismic test cases with different setups for a broader validity of the present results, to develop a seismic test case for the Groningen earthquake situation, to add measurement instrumentation to new and existing structures for verification of research results and to make such (raw) measurement data available to the public.

40|$|Sheet pile {{walls are}} one of the oldest earth {{retention}} systems utilized in civil engineering projects. They are used for various purposes; such as excavation support system, cofferdams, cut-off walls under dams, slope stabilization, waterfront structures, and flood walls. Sheet pile walls {{are one of}} the most common types of quay walls used in port construction. The worldwide increases in utilization of large ships for transportation have created an urgent need of deepening the seabed within port areas and consequently the rehabilitation of its wharfs. Several methods can be used to increase the load-carrying capacity of sheet-piling walls. The use of additional anchored tie rods grouted into the backfill soil and arranged along the exposed wall height is one of the most practical and appropriate solutions adopted for stabilization and rehabilitation of the <b>existing</b> <b>quay</b> wall.

40|$|Objectives of the Report_____________ The {{intention}} {{of this report}} is to supplement the "general principles" into recommendations and guidance for implementation to port structures. Port authorities {{are interested in the}} behaviour of the civil engineering elements of port infrastructure, particularly with respect to the financial, technical, safety and environmental decisions to be taken during the life-time of the structures. It therefore follows that to avoid unexpected largescale rehabilitation measures and costly downtimes as a consequence of neglected periodic maintenance, a systematic planning and budgeting of maintenance activities is necessary. LCM, and its precursor Whole Life Costing, will contribute to a realistic approach of maintenance policy, including decision-making, planning, budgeting and funding of inspection and repair activities during the life-time of port structures. The report focuses on LCM of port infrastructure such as wharves, quays jetties and breakwaters. Roads and buildings, as well as dredging associated with the structures, and port equipment such as cranes are excluded in the report, however similar principles will and frequently are used with respect to them. It cannot be over-emphasised that whilst the ideal is to set up LCM at the planning stage for a new project, it can be implemented at any time during a facility's lifetime for the remainder of its working life. It can also be used for a specific part of a facility, although in this case it is to be hoped that once the benefits are seen, LCM would be rapidly extended to cover all infrastructure in the port. _______________ Structure of the Report ________________ This report begins with an overview of LCM, which includes the necessary definitions of life cycles and performance criteria, description of the LCM process, the Whole Life Cost and Multi Criteria analysis. Chapter 3 includes a practical example for a container terminal. Chapter 4 covers the area of maintenance management following completion or refurbishment of a facility.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a study on}} {{an extension of the}} port of Klaipeda, Lithuania. The Klaipeda State Seaport Authority (KSSA) {{is in charge of the}} management and the provision of efficient hinterland connections. It considers increasing the depth to - 18 m CD at the quays necessary for attracting more cargo. This maximum depth is governed by the largest vessels that can enter the Baltic Sea. The port, therefore, wants to know the surplus value of this extra depth. The following questions are raised in this study: 1. what cargoes are likely to be captured with an extra depth of - 18 m CD? 2. where can the extra deepening be realised? 3. is a depth of - 18 m CD needed? A study on the present traded cargo and future expectations of cargo pointed out that the most important growth markets will be container trade and coal trade. The coal will be used for the supply of energy. The present energy supply of Lithuania is produced by a nuclear power plant close to Ignalina. This is a plant of the Tjernobyl type. The safety at this power plant is not optimal and the lifetime of the plant ends by 2005 - 2010. Therefore a new power plant which is coal fired is assumed in this study. The possibilities of using the existing port for the deepening are investigated and it is concluded that the deepening of the complete existing port seems rather expensive because of the present quay structures and the total volume of dredging works. The <b>existing</b> <b>quay</b> structures must be improved in case the port is deepened because its fundaments do not reach deep enough and stability cannot be guaranteed. Further, the space in the port is limited for constructing the associated terminals and the presence of the city obstructs efficient through transport to the hinterland. Another problem for the expansion of the existing port for larger depth is the width of the present entrance channel. The present entrance channel is narrow and widening is difficult because of the presence of the breakwaters. The largest vessels which can enter the Baltic Sea cannot enter the port of Klaipeda, unless the breakwater layout is adjusted, which is rather expensive. In order to calculate whether the depth of 18 meter is justified, four transportation schemes are discussed. Four alternatives are used for transporting the total volume of coal using different depth in the entrance channel and port. For the four alternatives the total cost of transporting the coal from the sending port to the power plant is calculated. These costs consist of cost of chartering the vessels which are needed for transporting the 15 million tons of coal, construction of the port which will determine the port tariffs and the through transport costs from the port to the power plant. These costs are described in table i by Sea for the sea transport, by Port for the port tariff and Land for the overland transport cost. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the impact of}} an {{earthquake}} on quay walls located at the Euromax terminal of the Port of Rotterdam is analyzed. A quay wall is a soil retaining structure where ships can moore and transfer goods. Seismic behaviour of {{two different types of}} quay walls are investigated and compared by performing a seismic analysis on the Euromax terminal. The first quay wall is the <b>existing</b> <b>quay</b> wall of the Euromax terminal which is a diaphragm quay wall with relieving structure and the second quay wall is a caisson quay wall. The seismic analysis is based on three steps which will include assessment of the regional seismicity, the geologic hazards and soil-structure interaction analysis. The first step is to define the earthquake motion and its magnitude for the Euromax terminal. This is done by making a seismic hazard analysis which is based on geologic, tectonic and historical seismicity data available for the Netherlands. The probability of occurrence of a high earthquake magnitude at the Euromax terminal is very low {{due to the fact that}} no major faults are located near the terminal. The second step is to define the dynamic soil response of the Euromax terminal. This is accomplished by making a liquefaction analysis to determine the liquefaction resistance of the near surface soils and the associated potential for ground failure. Loose soils are much more susceptible to liquefaction than dense soils. The soil deposit at the eastern side of the terminal consists of several layers of loose sand which made this the most sensitive section to liquefaction. Liquefaction at this location occurs at earthquake magnitude of ML = 6, 2 which corresponds with a horizontal peak ground acceleration of aH = 3 m/s 2 and a return period of 751000 years. The final step is to make a seismic analysis of the quay wall structure including seismic forces acting on the two different quay walls. A literature study shows that once an earthquake hits the Euromax terminal causing the ground to shake may result in three major disadvantageous consequences for a quay wall structure. First the driving forces acting on the quay wall will increase. Secondly, shear resistance may decrease due to excess pore water generation resulting in softening of the soil and resonance may develop when the earthquake frequency reaches the fundamental frequency of the structure. The three consequences may result in strength, stability and displacement failure of a quay wall structure. Over all it can be concluded that the probability of occurrence of high magnitude earthquakes are very low. When an earthquake does strike the Euromax terminal the diaphragm quay walls and a caisson quay walls fail in a different way. It appeared that the critical failure mechanism of the diaphragm quay wall is caused by the insufficient bending capacity of the diaphragm wall resulting in breaking of the diaphragm wall. For the caisson quay wall the critical situation relates to large deformations of the landside crane track causing the cranes not to function properly. Nevertheless, both failure mechanisms occur at the same order of earthquake magnitude ML ? 5, 1 which corresponds to a return period of approximate 2500 years. This indicates that both quay walls have the same order of resistance against earthquake. However, the consequences of the diaphragm quay wall failure and probably also for the combined walls will be much higher compared to that of the caisson. For this reason, the caisson quay wall is a better solution against earthquakes compared to the diaphragm wall. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|This thesis has {{as subject}} the {{shielding}} effect of piles {{on the front}} wall of quay walls. The reason for writing {{this paper is to}} find an answer to the difference between field measurements and design calculations of stresses and deflections in the front wall of a special type of quay wall in the Port of Rotterdam. The relevance of this issue concerns the optimization of a quay wall with relieving structure to investigate the behavior of this construction and possibly to reduce costs. Focus is on the behavior of prefabricated concrete bearing piles and MV-pile anchors below relieving structures. This thesis has been prepared for obtaining the degree Master of Science in Civil Engineering at the Technical University in Delft. The purpose of this research is to analyze and quantify the shielding effect of piles on the front retaining wall of quay walls. From measurements on the extension works for the EKOM quay wall in the Port of Rotterdam it can be concluded that the design calculations and field measurements do not comply. The calculated maximum front wall deflections are higher than the measured values and also the maximum calculated bending moments in the front retaining wall are higher than measured. These findings have been used in the design of a more recent quay wall project in the Amazonehaven by applying bending moment reduction factors for the front retaining wall. This research focusses on how the prefabricated concrete bearing piles and MV-pile anchors contribute to lower deformations and bending moments in the front retaining wall. For this research a literature study is conducted to determine the design aspects of an <b>existing</b> <b>quay</b> wall in the Amazonehaven in the Port of Rotterdam. Furthermore the recommendations of the handbook Quay Walls, design guidelines for horizontally loaded piles, behavior of arc forces in soils and recommendations for shell factors in soils have been studied. For the research an analytical method based on Van IJsseldijk - Loof and Begemann – De Leeuw and also a finite element method (FEM) using Plaxis 2 D have been applied. The results of the analytical method have resulted in an initial input on the shielding effect of piles on the front retaining wall of quay walls. The method makes use of simplified models and ground data. Horizontal soil stress reductions near the combi-wall over the Holocene soil layers of 20 % is considered maximum feasible. The method based on FEM is prepared to make a comparison with the analytical method and to use sophisticated models and soil data for more details. The comparison shows that the horizontal soil stress reductions near the combi-wall corresponds well, but that the bending moments and pile wall deflections differ between both methods. The conclusions reached with the FEM method has led to a shielding effect of the piles on the maximum field bending moments in the combi-wall of 13 %. The MV-pile anchors have a small to negligible influence on the shielding effect. As conclusion {{it can be said that}} for the design of quay walls with relieving structures the shielding effect of piles on the front retaining wall is part of the design. Reductions of 13 % are achievable according to the FEM analysis. It is advised to design quay walls with relieving structures with FEM. This provides a better picture of how relieving structures work and the shielding effect of piles can be modeled in more detail. It is also recommended to conduct more field research to determine the shielding effects for different quay walls designs.

40|$|The city of Dubai {{has grown}} {{extensively}} in the last decades. The growth of Dubai’s infrastructure has not kept pace {{with the growth of}} the city itself, which results in traffic jams and overcrowding of public transport facilities. To make the Dubai area (city and suburbs) more accessible, a ferry network is being developed to provide transportation facilities for the 26 million tourist and commuters who crowd the city annually. The first part of the ferry network that will be built consists of one line with 4 terminals. The Al Ghubaiba terminal is the largest of the four terminals; it holds a key position in the city centre and needs to become a real landmark. The free-formed design for the Al Ghubaiba terminal made by Royal Haskoning Architects combines modern architecture with efficient spatial planning. Creating a structural solution that underlines the desired architectural appearance {{is considered to be a}} challenge. The main goal of this Master’s thesis is to analyze a structural solution in reinforced concrete for the roof structure of the Al Ghubaiba Ferry Terminal according to the initial design concept made by Royal Haskoning Architects. The architect’s design concept defines the roof of the Al Ghubaiba terminal as a canopy that is created by carefully lifting the <b>existing</b> <b>quay.</b> The public area hereby continues smoothly over the terminal roof, creating a elevated square. To accentuate this design concept, a slender roof structure is required which contains a transparent façade along the creek site and has a column-free floor plan. The type of load carrying mechanism present in a thin concrete structure is highly dependent on its shape, slenderness, loading and support conditions. For a large span roof in reinforced concrete a good shape is of vital importance. A good shape in this sense has an internal flow of forces which is primary based on membrane forces and does not suffer from buckling instability. The terminal roof has a complex geometry which contains parts of beam, plate, arch and shell action. These load carrying mechanisms are analyzed to review their efficiency and to determine the relation of the geometry of a structure to its internal flow of forces. The knowledge obtained in this analysis is used to optimize the structural geometry of the terminal roof. A simplified finite element model is made in DIANA to analyze the structural behaviour of the roof structure. An analysis of the initial roof structure reveals that the roof structure contains a large amount of bending and is critical to buckling. A viable structural solution which makes use of this initial roof geometry and is column free is for this reason problematic. Based on calculation results a roof geometry is suggested which has a more preferable structural behaviour. Regarding structural mechanics it is known that designs with an utmost slenderness can be obtained if a geometry approaches the funicular shape of its governing loading. The property of a funicular shape is that, for a specific loading condition, only membrane forces are used to transfer the external load. A method is developed to find a roof geometry which approaches the funicular shape of its typical loading condition. This method uses the initial structural geometry and combines this with its displacement field to obtain an improved shape. Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} 50 years {{there have been}} many {{documented}} failures of gravity retaining quay walls due to earthquake events. These failures are often associated with significant deformation of liquefiable soil deposits (e. g. major damage occurred at Kobe Port during the 1995 Hyogoken-Nanbu earthquake). Saudi Arabia has similar types of quay walls located in regions that have the potential to experience significant seismic events. These walls have not been designed for seismic resistance and therefore have the potential to suffer serious damage from seismic activity. For many years the design of seismic gravity quay walls has been studied and design codes for engineering practice established; however, the widespread failures of these structures during recent earthquakes demonstrates that these design methods may be insufficient. Such gravity quay wall failures have stimulated progress {{in the development of a}} performance-based seismic design method using non-linear inelastic dynamic analysis for quay wall structures. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology for the seismic design of gravity quay walls using a non-linear elasto-plastic dynamic analysis. The final method adopted in this work is based on the generalised elasto-plasiticity constitutive model developed by Pastor et aL (1990), with some minor modifications, which has been incorporated into a finite element procedure. The proposed P-Z sand model was first validated by simulating published monotonic and cyclic test results. Secondly, an effective stress analysis was established by developing a finite element model for Kobe Port Island quay walls using the P-Z sand model. This model was validated by comparing the predicted deformations with those experienced at Kobe. The computed residual deformations from the analysis were in good agreement with published field observations. To develop mitigation strategies, a parametric study of the seismic perfonnance of gravity quay walls, using the effective stress analysis, was conducted. This study assessed the effect of various structural and geotechnical parameters on the seismic performance of quay walls. Twenty-six cases of effective stress analysis with variation in tidal range, soil permeability, soil relative densities, and wall widths were conducted as well as analyses to test the importance of considering multi-directional seismic excitations as opposed to uni-directional. In order to assess the safety of <b>existing</b> <b>quay</b> walls in Jeddah Port, an experimental programme was conducted. This programme consisted of a site investigation (using a standard penetration test (SPT)) to determine the in situ relative density of the existing backfill, a series of laboratory based, monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests (to define the soil properties of Jeddah Port sand) and a two-dimensional effective stress finite element analysis of a typical Jeddah quay wall. The monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests were conducted for three different relative densities of D, = 35 %, 55 % and 75 %. These represent loose (equal to in situ conditions as established by the site investigation), medium dense and dense sand. The experimental results are discussed and then used to identify the P-Z sand model parameters. These parameters were used in conjunction with a finite element analysis of Jeddah Port quay walls to Predict the seismic deformations. In this analysis the finite element model was subjected to a number of different ground motions, which represented two different levels of earthquake intensity; namely moderate and strong ground shaking. The effect of improvement strategies such as increasing the relative density of the backfill and foundation materials was then assessed The results of the simulations showed that existing Jeddah Port quay walls are not satisfactory to resist either moderate or strong earthquake excitations. However, if the relative density is increased to 55 % then satisfactory performance can be achieved for a moderate intensity earthquake. For the case of strong shaking, the analysis showed that the quay walls did not demonstrate the required performance levels; however, they were only under specification by 10 %. Finally, a flowchart illustrating a seismic design procedure for gravity quay walls has been proposed, which is applicable to both existing and new gravity quay walls. Key-words: quay wall, liquefaction, earthquake, port, effective stress, constitutive model.
