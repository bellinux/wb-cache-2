500|$|The Lord Chancellor had, {{since the}} 15th century, been tasked with {{administering}} estates where the estate {{was to be}} used for charitable purposes. In Bailiff of Burford v Lenthall, Lord Hardwicke suggested that the jurisdiction of the Court over charity matters came from its jurisdiction over trusts, {{as well as from the}} Charitable Uses Act 1601. Carne suggests that, as the Court had long been able to deal with such situations, the 1601 act was actually just the declaration of pre-existing custom. This is illustrated by the Chancellor's original jurisdiction over feoffments to uses, which came from his original status as a clergyman, as charity had been originally enforced by the Church and the ecclesiastical courts. Essentially, an owner of land could dispose of it by granting the right to use it and collect fees to another, not just by selling it. This was not valid at the common law courts but was in the Court of Chancery; the Lord Chancellor is reported as having said, in 1492, [...] "where there is no remedy at common law there may be good remedy in conscience, as, for example, by a feoffment upon confidence, the <b>feoffor</b> has no remedy by common law, and yet by conscience he has; and so, if the feoffee transfers to another who knows of this confidence, the <b>feoffor,</b> by means of a subpoena, will have his rights in this Court". After the reign of Edward IV, if the charitable land were to be sold (or land were to be sold to create the charity) the Court of Chancery was the only place this could be done, as ecclesiastical and probate courts did not have a valid jurisdiction.|$|E

This was created by later common law jurisdictions. Personal trust law developed in England {{at the time of the}} Crusades, during the 12th and 13th centuries.

5000|$|The {{conveyance}} or {{delivery of}} possession, known as {{livery of seisin}} was effected generally {{on the site of}} the land in a symbolic ceremony of transfer from the <b>feoffor</b> to the feoffee in the presence of witnesses. Written conveyances were customary and mandatory after 1677.|$|E
5000|$|The {{effect of}} the statute of Quia Emptores (1290) {{was to make the}} {{creation}} of manors henceforward impossible, inasmuch as it enacted [...] "that upon all sales and feoffments of land the feoffee shall hold the same, not of his immediate <b>feoffor,</b> but of the chief lord of the fee of whom such <b>feoffor</b> himself held it". The statute did not apply to a tenant-in-chief of the king, who might have alienated his land under a license. Accordingly, it is assumed that all existing manors are [...] "of a date prior to the statute of Quia Emptores except perhaps some which may have been created by the king's tenants-in-chief with license from the crown". When a great baron had granted out smaller manors to others, the seignory of the superior baron was frequently termed an honour.|$|E
50|$|Quia Emptores {{addressed}} {{the question of}} outright sales of land rights. It declared that every freeman might sell his tenement or any part of it, but {{in such a manner}} that the feoffee should hold the same lord and by the same services, of whom and by which the <b>feoffor</b> held. In case only a part was sold, the services were to be apportioned between the part sold and the part retained in accordance with their quantities.|$|E
5000|$|The feoffee was thenceforward said to {{hold his}} {{property}} [...] "of" [...] or [...] "from" [...] the <b>feoffor,</b> {{in return for a}} specified service depending on the exact form of feudal land tenure involved in the feoffment. Thus for every holding of land during the feudal era there existed an historical unbroken chain of feoffees, in the form of overlords, ultimately springing from feoffments made by William the Conqueror himself in 1066 as the highest overlord of all.|$|E
50|$|Warrantia chartae is {{an ancient}} and now {{obsolete}} writ, which was issued when a man was enfeoffed of land with warranty, {{and then he was}} sued or imploded in assize or other action, in which he could not vouch or call to warranty. It was brought by the <b>feoffor</b> pending the first suit against him, and had this valuable incident, that when the warrantor was vouched, and judgment passed against the tenant, the latter obtained judgment simultaneously against the warrantor, to recover other lands of equal value.|$|E

And therefore they shall do no fealty to their lord ... because, that this divine service is better for them before God, than any doing of fealty; and also because that these words (frank-almoign) exclude the lord to have any earthly or temporal service, but to have only divine and spiritual service {{to be done for}} him, &c.|$|E

The action was on the statute of 5 Richard II against forcible entry, and the plaintiff sued [...] "tam pro domine Rege quam pro seipso". The original <b>feoffor</b> mentioned in the defendant's plea was Thomas Trevistarum. In the plaintiff's replication the famous recovery {{is alleged to have}} taken place in the Easter term of 5 Edward IV, before Robert Danby and his fellow justices of the bench. The writ stated that John Arundel, the lord of the fee, had remised his court. The demandant in it was Thomas Talkarum or Talcarum. His name is written many times, now with a k, now with a c, never with a t. The vouchee was Robert Kyng. The well-known rejoinder about the settlement made by John Tregoz was pleaded only as to twenty-four acres, parcel of the land in question. As to the residue the plaintiff pleaded in a more general fashion {{that at the time of}} the recovery Humphrey Smyth was not seised of the freehold, and that therefore the recovery was void in law" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{appearance of}} cestui que {{in the medieval}} period was the feoffee to uses, which like the Salman, held on account of another. This was called the cestui que use. It was because the <b>feoffor</b> could impose on him many various duties that landowners acquired through his instrumentality {{the power to do}} many things with their land. This was a to avoid the rigidity of medieval common law of land and its uses. Germanic law was familiar with the idea that a man who holds property on account of, or to the use of another is bound to fulfill his trust. Frankish formulas from the Merovingian period describe property given to a church [...] "ad opus sancti illius." [...] Mercian books in the ninth century convey land [...] "ad opus monachorum". The Domesday Book refers to geld or money, sac and soc held in [...] "ad opus regus", or in [...] "reginae" [...] or [...] "vicecomitis". The laws of William I of England speak of the sheriff holding money [...] "al os le rei" [...] ("for the use of the king").|$|E
50|$|It {{became the}} law after the Conquest, {{according}} to Sir Edward Coke, that an estate greater {{than for a}} term of years could be disposed of by will, unless in Kent, where the custom of gavelkind prevailed, and in some manors and boroughs (especially the City of London), where the pre-Conquest law was preserved by special indulgence. The reason why devise of land was not acknowledged by law was, no doubt, partly to discourage deathbed gifts in mortmain, a view supported by Glanvill, partly because the testator could not give the devisee that seisin which was the principal element in a feudal conveyance. By means of the doctrine to uses, however, the devise of land was secured by a circuitous method, generally by conveyance to feoffees to uses in the lifetime of the <b>feoffor</b> to such uses as he should appoint by his will. Up to comparatively recent times a will of lands still bore traces of its origin in the conveyance to uses inter vivos. On {{the passing of the}} Statute of Uses lands again became non-devisable, with a saving in the statute for the validity of wills made before 1 May 1536. The inconvenience of this state of things soon began to be felt, and was probably aggravated by the large amount of land thrown into the market after the dissolution of the monasteries. As a remedy an Act was passed in 1540 (which {{came to be known as}} the Statute of Wills), and a further explanatory Act in 1542-1543.|$|E
40|$|Professor Gray, in {{the first}} edition of his great work, 2 ̆ 2 The Rule Against Perpetuities, 2 ̆ 2 Section 31 and following, contended that the Statute Quia Emptores by putting an end to tenure between <b>feoffor</b> and feoffee of an estate in fee simple, {{incidentally}} put an end to possibility of reverter to the feoffer on failure of the condition in a determihable fee. Specifically he says that upon dissolution of an eleemosynary corporation a terminable gift to such corporation does not revert to the donor, as is said by Lord Coke, Co. LITT. 13 b, but escheats. For reversion depends on tenure, and the Statute by destroying tenure ends possibility of reverter. In his third edition, Section 40 a, he notes that since the second edition of his book three cases have held contra, [...] North v. Graham. 235 Ill. 178, Pond v. Douglass, 106 Me. 85, and Board of Chosen Freeholders v. Buck, 779 N. J. Eq. 472. These follow a dictum in First Universalist Society v. Boland, 155 Mass. 171, which 2 ̆ 2 he considers as opposed to a case not to be distinguished from it, the leading case of Brattle Square Church v. Grant, 3 Gray 142. The learned author regards Lord Coke 2 ̆ 7 s statement that land of a corporation upon its dissolution reverted to the donor or grantor, while upon the death of a natural person without heirs his land escheated, as based on cases which do not uphold him, and the rule as not surviving his retirement, for Johnson v. Norway Winch 37, 1622, shows a great doubt {{on the part of the}} judges, and though the report does not give the final decision on the point, Lord Hale 2 ̆ 7 s MSS. cited Co. LITT. 13 b, Harg. note, say they held the land escheated. Lord Coke seems to have but a dictum in one case to support him, and only one case that has ever followed it, GRAY Section 51...|$|E
