Differences between the satellite- and ground-based measurements of the TOC at the Vernadsky Station are taken into consideration. The modelled erythemally <b>effective</b> UVB <b>radiation</b> differed slightly depending on the seasons and sources of the TOC. The model relative prediction error for ground- and satellite-based measurements varied between 9. 5 % and 9. 6 % in the period of 2002 - 2003, while it ranged from 7. 4 % to 8. 8 % in the period of 2003 - 2004...|$|R
25|$|It {{was water}} hammer {{that caused the}} {{physical}} damage to the reactor, the deaths of personnel who stood atop and nearby, {{and the release of}} radioactive isotopes to the environment. One of the lessons learned from SL-1 was that there is an extreme water hammer hazard whenever a shutdown reactor is cooled to room temperature and there is an air gap between the top of the water and the reactor vessel head. One of the recommendations in the analysis of the incident was that shutdown reactors be filled to the top with water so that a power excursion could not induce such a powerful water hammer. Air is not dense enough to appreciably slow water, while water (being nearly incompressible) is able to distribute explosive forces and limit peak pressure. The extra water is also a very <b>effective</b> <b>radiation</b> shield for those who are directly above the vessel. Written procedures at SL-1 had included a directive to pump down the level of water in the reactor prior to the maintenance procedure that destroyed it.|$|E

2500|$|PET {{scanning}} {{with the}} tracer fluorine-18 (F-18) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), called FDG-PET, {{is widely used}} in clinical oncology. [...] This tracer is a glucose analog that is taken up by glucose-using cells and phosphorylated by hexokinase (whose mitochondrial form is greatly elevated in rapidly growing malignant tumors). A typical dose of FDG used in an oncological scan has an <b>effective</b> <b>radiation</b> dose of 14mSv. Because the oxygen atom that is replaced by F-18 to generate FDG {{is required for the}} next step in glucose metabolism in all cells, no further reactions occur in FDG. Furthermore, most tissues (with the notable exception of liver and kidneys) cannot remove the phosphate added by hexokinase. This means that FDG is trapped in any cell that takes it up until it decays, since phosphorylated sugars, due to their ionic charge, cannot exit from the cell. This results in intense radiolabeling of tissues with high glucose uptake, such as the brain, the liver, and most cancers. [...] As a result, FDG-PET can be used for diagnosis, staging, and monitoring treatment of cancers, particularly in Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and lung cancer.|$|E

40|$|A {{biochemical}} dosimeter {{was developed}} to study the attenuation of biologically <b>effective</b> UV <b>radiation</b> in marine tropical waters. Small quartz vials were used containing a solution of DNA molecules; the vials were incubated at discrete water depths.

Measurements of DNA damage were compared with calculated biologically effective doses, as derived from spectroradiometer measurements. The biodosimeter {{was found to be}} a reliable and easy tool to determine levels of harmful UV radiation in marine waters. The highest attenuation coefficient (1. 60 m- 1) measured with the biochemical dosimeter was found in eutrophic waters, at a coastal station off Curab̧cao, Netherlands Antilles. At the other stations attenuation coefficients ranged from 0. 18 m- 1 in central Atlantic waters to 0. 43 m- 1 close to the Curabcao coast line.

40|$|Over 3000 cancer {{patients}} {{have already been}} treated by the heavy-ion medical accelerator in Chiba at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences since 1994. The clinical results have clearly verified the effectiveness and safety of heavy-ion radiotherapy. The most important result has been to establish that the carbon ion {{is one of the}} most <b>effective</b> <b>radiations</b> for radiotherapy. The ion source is required to realize a stable beam with the same conditions for daily operation. However, the deposition of carbon ions on the wall of the plasma chamber is normally unavoidable. This causes an "anti- wall-coating effect," i. e., a decreasing of the beam, especially for the higher charge-state ions due to the surface material of the wall. The ion source must be required to produce a sufficiently intense beam under the bad condition. Other problems were solved by improvements and maintenance, and thus we obtained enough reproducibility and stability along with decreased failures. We summarize our over 13 years of experience, and show the scope for further developments. (C) 2008 Arnerican Institute of Physics...|$|R
