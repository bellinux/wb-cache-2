50|$|In geology and climatology, a pluvial {{is either}} a modern climate {{characterized}} by relatively <b>high</b> <b>precipitation,</b> or an interval of time of variable length - decades to thousands of years - during which a climate is characterized by either relatively <b>high</b> <b>precipitation</b> or humidity. Subdivisions of a pluvial, which are characterized by relatively <b>high</b> <b>precipitation,</b> are known as a subpluvials. Formally, pluvials were equated with glacial stages of the Quaternary. However, pluvials, as in equatorial regions, can also occur during interglacial stages. Lower latitudes have even experienced major pluvials in early to mid-Holocene times.|$|R
40|$|The {{link between}} <b>high</b> <b>precipitation</b> in Dronning Maud Land (DML), Antarctica, and the {{large-scale}} atmospheric circulation is investigated using ERA-Interim data for 1979 - 2009. High-precipitation events are analyzed at Halvfarryggen {{situated in the}} coastal region of DML and at Kohnen Station located in its interior. This study further includes a comprehensive comparison of <b>high</b> <b>precipitation</b> in ERA-Interim with precipitation data from the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) and snow accumulation measurements from automatic weather stations (AWSs), with the limitations of such a comparison being discussed. The ERA-Interim and AMPS precipitation data agree very well. However, the correspondence between <b>high</b> <b>precipitation</b> in ERA-Interim and high snow accumulation at the AWSs is relatively weak. High-precipitation events at both Halvfarryggen and Kohnen are typically associated with amplified upper level waves. This large-scale atmospheric flow pattern is preceded by the downstream development of a Rossby wave train from the eastern South Pacific several days before the precipitation event. At the surface, a cyclone located over the Weddell Sea is the main synoptic ingredient for <b>high</b> <b>precipitation</b> both at Halvfarryggen and at Kohnen. A blocking anticyclone downstream is not a requirement for <b>high</b> <b>precipitation</b> per se, but {{a larger share of}} blocking occurrences during the highest-precipitation days in DML suggests that these blocks strengthen the vertically integrated water vapor transport (IVT) into DML. A strong link between <b>high</b> <b>precipitation</b> and the IVT perpendicular to the local orography suggests that IVT {{could be used as a}} "proxy" for <b>high</b> <b>precipitation,</b> in particular over DML's interior...|$|R
