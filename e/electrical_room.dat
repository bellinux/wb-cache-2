25|$|On November 19, 2009, {{a fire in}} the <b>electrical</b> <b>room</b> of the station's Broadcast Hill studios knocked both {{stations}} off the air. Fire alarms were activated {{throughout the}} facility at 9:30p.m. that evening, which resulted in staff members being evacuated from the studio; this resulted in the disruption of that evening's scheduled broadcasts of the 10:00p.m. newscasts seen respectively on KXAS and KXTX. On February 12, 2013, LIN Media chose to withdraw its interest in the Station Venture Operations joint venture as part of a corporate reorganization. Through the dissolution of the arrangement, NBC gained full ownership of KXAS and regained exclusive ownership in KNSD.|$|E
500|$|One Times Square has {{continued}} to house tenants in its ground-level floors: in the late 1990s, a Warner Bros. retail store filled the first three floors. In early 2006, the floors were occupied by a J. C. Penney pop-up store known as The J C. Penney Experience. [...] In November 2008, pharmacy chain Walgreens opened a new flagship store in the space, renting it in a lease valued at $4 million yearly. Walgreens also introduced a new digital sign to the building {{as part of its}} grand opening: designed by Gilmore Group and constructed by D3 LED, the [...] sign runs diagonally up both sides of the building and contains 12 million LEDs, surpassing the nearby NASDAQ sign as the largest LED sign in Times Square. The former <b>electrical</b> <b>room</b> in the tower's basement currently serves as a [...] "vault" [...] for the storage of items relating to New Year's Eve celebrations at Times Square, including the ball itself (prior to 2009), spare parts, numeral signage and other memorabilia.|$|E
500|$|Architects {{including}} Thom Weeks and Jennifer Stanley led renovations of the Stanley into a live theatre. Weeks {{was initially}} {{disappointed with the}} state of the pre-renovated theatre, which looked [...] "pretty tired" [...] with its aged orange walls and sticky, soft drink-stained carpets. However, by the time the renovations were completed, and the actors and musicians were getting ready to first perform in it, there was a general feeling of excitement about the theatre. Renovations included expansion of the lobby, reconfiguration of the balcony, an expansion of the stage to twice its original size, a new twenty-five metre fly tower from which to raise and lower scenery, new dressing rooms, a trap room, an <b>electrical</b> <b>room</b> and a green room backstage, a reduction of the number of seats from 1,216 to 650, a crush bar in the old projection booth, a section cut out of the theatre's dome to use for spotlights, and a full restoration of the theatre's gold-leafed plaster decorations. As a result of these renovations, in 1999 the theatre was awarded a City of Vancouver Heritage Award, as well as an IES International Illumination Design Award.|$|E

50|$|An <b>electrical</b> <b>room</b> is a room {{or space}} in a {{building}} dedicated to electrical equipment.

50|$|Union Hall was {{originally}} constructed to seat 499, with a stage 72 ft {{from front to}} back and a proscenium arch of 38 ft. Under the stage was an extensive basement with dressing rooms, and <b>electrical</b> <b>room</b> and a workshop.|$|E
50|$|When it {{was still}} in use, the seven floors and the {{basement}} of the mill all had specific purposes. The basement held a transformer vault, water inlets, and an <b>electrical</b> <b>room.</b> On the first floor there was a small floor-mounted sifter, a larger ceiling-hung sifter, and a pressure tank. On the second floor there were conveyor belts and a staff lunchroom. The third floor contained more belts and bins and the fourth floor held a dust collector, centrifugal machine, gyration shifter, grinder, scale, and a packing bin. The fifth floor held a sifter, separator, and a centrifugal machine. The sixth floor held flour bins and the seventh floor was an <b>electrical</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{details of}} layout and {{construction}} of electrical rooms will be controlled by local building code and electrical code regulations. Requirements for an <b>electrical</b> <b>room</b> relate to fire safety and electrical hazards. An <b>electrical</b> <b>room</b> is usually required to be secured from access by unauthorized persons; these rules are especially strict where equipment within the room has exposed live terminals. Regulations may require two separate means of exit from a room where the power rating of circuits exceeds some threshold, to allow for quick exit in an emergency. [...] Rooms containing oil-filled equipment {{may be required to}} have fire-resistant construction or active fire suppression equipment in the room and may be designated as an electrical vault. Since power distribution often requires large numbers of electrical cables, special measures for fire resistance of cables and cable trays may be also specified by regulations.|$|E
