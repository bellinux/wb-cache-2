5000|$|World War II saw new {{production}} of the Springfield at private manufacturers Remington Arms and Smith-Corona Typewriter. Remington began {{production of the}} M1903 in September 1941, at serial number 3,000,000, using old tooling from the Rock Island Arsenal which had been in storage since 1919. The very early rifles are almost indistinguishable from 1919-made Rock Island rifles. As the already worn tooling began to wear beyond use Remington began seeking Army approval for a continuously increasing number of changes and simplifications to both speed up manufacture and improve performance. The milled parts on the Remington M1903 were gradually replaced with stamped parts until, at about serial number 3,330,000, the Army and Remington recognized that a new model name was appropriate. Other features of the M1903, such as high-grade walnut stocks with finger grooves, were replaced with less expensive but serviceable substitutes. Most milled parts made by Remington were marked with an [...] "R". M1903 production was discontinued {{in favor of the}} M1903A3. The most noticeable visual difference in the M1903A3 was the replacement of the barrel-mounted rear sight with a smaller, simpler aperture rear sight mounted on the rear of the receiver; it was primarily adopted in order to speed familiarization by soldiers already trained on the M1 Garand, which had a similar sighting system. However, the leaf spring providing tension to the elevation adjustment on the new aperture sight tended to weaken with continued use over time, causing the rifle to lose its preset range <b>elevation</b> <b>setting.</b> Other modifications included a new stamped cartridge follower; ironically, the rounded edges of the new design largely alleviated the 'fourth-round jam' complaints of the earlier machined part.

Missouri Baptist University, Saint Louis, Missouri; e-mail: haleygrueber@gmail. com A {{method that}} is used to {{facilitate}} improvements in an individual’s aerobic fitness is altitude training. Most increases in aerobic fitness within altitude training are seen at 8, 000 to 10, 000 feet (Goods et al., 2014). The most recent device in altitude training is the Elevation Training Mask 2. 0. PURPOSE: Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to examine the extent to which an individual’s aerobic fitness was increased while training with the Elevation Training Mask 2. 0 compared to a control group training without a mask. METHODS: Nine female participants’ (mean age = 21 years) ran a VO 2 Max test to measure their aerobic fitness baseline. Each participant was then randomized into either an experimental or control group. Both groups completed the same evidence-based High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) three days a week for four weeks. The experimental group wore the Elevation Training Mask 2. 0 during HIIT, while the control group wore no breathing apparatus. The resistance upon the mask was increased from 3, 000 feet to 6, 000 feet during week three of training. After four weeks of training, the participants’ aerobic fitness was again assessed using a VO 2 Max test. One participant dropped out of the study due to musculoskeletal injury. The data was analyzed with paired t-tests and Cohen’s d effect sizes were computed. RESULTS: There was no significant differences across the experimental and control group’s relative change in VO 2 max scores (t(6) =- 0. 05, p 3 ̆c 0. 48) with little to no effect (d= 0. 03). Within the experimental group from pre to post VO 2 max there was a moderate positive effect size (d= 0. 54) but there was no statistical significance (t(8) =- 0. 86, p 3 ̆c 0). CONCLUSION: The Elevation Training Mask 2. 0 did not significantly increase the individual’s aerobic fitness over the course of four weeks when compared to the control group at a 3, 000 to 6, 000 feet <b>elevation</b> <b>setting.</b> However, effect sizes indicated a moderate effect within the experimental group for increases in aerobic fitness. The Elevation Training Mask 2. 0 shows promise for facilitating increases in aerobic training when used in conjunction with an evidence-based HIIT training protocol...|$|E
40|$|Habitat loss, fragmentation, and {{degradation}} threaten the World’s ecosystems and species. These, and other threats, {{will likely be}} exacerbated by climate change. Due to a limited budget for conservation, {{we are forced to}} prioritize a few areas over others. These places are selected based on their uniqueness and vulnerability. One of the most famous examples is the biodiversity hotspots: areas where large quantities of endemic species meet alarming rates of habitat loss. Most of these places are in the tropics, where species have smaller ranges, diversity is higher, and ecosystems are most threatened. Species distributions are useful to understand ecological theory and evaluate extinction risk. Small-ranged species, or those endemic to one place, are more vulnerable to extinction than widely distributed species. However, current range maps often overestimate the distribution of species, including areas that are not within the suitable elevation or habitat for a species. Consequently, assessment of extinction risk using these maps could underestimate vulnerability. In order to be effective in our quest to conserve the World’s most important places we must: 1) Translate global and national priorities into practical local actions, 2) Find synergies between biodiversity conservation and human welfare, 3) Evaluate the different dimensions of threats, in order to design effective conservation measures and prepare for future threats, and 4) Improve the methods used to evaluate species’ extinction risk and prioritize areas for conservation. The purpose of this dissertation is to address these points in Colombia and other global biodiversity hotspots. In Chapter 2, I identified the global, strategic conservation priorities and then downscaled to practical local actions within the selected priorities in Colombia. I used existing range maps of 171 bird species to identify priority conservation areas that would protect the greatest number of species at risk in Colombia (endemic and small-ranged species). The Western Andes had the highest concentrations of such species— 100 in total—but the lowest densities of national parks. I then adjusted the priorities for this region by refining these species ranges by selecting only areas of suitable elevation and remaining habitat. The estimated ranges of these species shrank by 18 – 100 % after accounting for habitat and suitable <b>elevation.</b> <b>Setting</b> conservation priorities on the basis of currently available range maps excluded priority areas in the Western Andes and, by extension, likely elsewhere and for other taxa. By incorporating detailed maps of remaining natural habitats, I made practical recommendations for conservation actions. One recommendation was to restore forest connections to a patch of cloud forest about to become isolated from the main Andes. For Chapter 3, I identified areas where bird conservation met ecosystem service protection in the Central Andes of Colombia. Inspired by the November 11 th (2011) landslide event near Manizales, and the current poor results of Colombia’s Article 111 of Law 99 of 1993 as a conservation measure in this country, I set out to prioritize conservation and restoration areas where landslide prevention would complement bird conservation in the Central Andes. This area {{is one of the most}} biodiverse places on Earth, but also one of the most threatened. Using the case of the Rio Blanco Reserve, near Manizales, I identified areas for conservation where endemic and small-range bird diversity was high, and where landslide risk was also high. I further prioritized restoration areas by overlapping these conservation priorities with a forest cover map. Restoring forests in bare areas of high landslide risk and important bird diversity yields benefits for both biodiversity and people. I developed a simple landslide susceptibility model using slope, forest cover, aspect, and stream proximity. Using publicly available bird range maps, refined by elevation, I mapped concentrations of endemic and small-range bird species. I identified 1. 54 km 2 of potential restoration areas in the Rio Blanco Reserve, and 886 km 2 in the Central Andes region. By prioritizing these areas, I facilitate the application of Article 111 which requires local and regional governments to invest in land purchases for the conservation of watersheds. Chapter 4 dealt with elevational ranges of montane birds and the impact of lowland deforestation on their ranges in the Western Andes of Colombia, an important biodiversity hotspot. Using point counts and mist-nets, I surveyed six altitudinal transects spanning 2200 to 2800 m. Three transects were forested from 2200 to 2800 m, and three were partially deforested with forest cover only above 2400 m. I compared abundance-weighted mean elevation, minimum elevation, and elevational range width. In addition to analyzing the effect of deforestation on 134 species, I tested its impact within trophic guilds and habitat preference groups. Abundance-weighted mean and minimum elevations were not significantly different between forested and partially deforested transects. Range width was marginally different: as expected, ranges were larger in forested transects. Species in different trophic guilds and habitat preference categories showed different trends. These results suggest that deforestation may affect species’ elevational ranges, even within the forest that remains. Climate change will likely exacerbate harmful impacts of deforestation on species’ elevational distributions. Future conservation strategies need to account for this by protecting connected forest tracts across a wide range of elevations. In Chapter 5, I refine the ranges of 726 species from six biodiversity hotspots by suitable elevation and habitat. This set of 172 bird species for the Atlantic Forest, 138 for Central America, 100 for the Western Andes of Colombia, 57 for Madagascar, 102 for Sumatra, and 157 for Southeast Asia met the criteria for range size, endemism, threat, and forest use. Of these 586 species, the Red List deems 108 to be threatened: 15 critically endangered, 29 endangered, and 64 vulnerable. When ranges are refined by elevational limits and remaining forest cover, 10 of those critically endangered species have ranges Dissertatio...|$|E
