5000|$|New South Wales's {{prima facie}} 50 {{miles per hour}} or 80 km/hr limit, often signed by <b>derestriction</b> signs, was only {{enforced}} in cases where a driver's speed could be demonstrated to be excessive or dangerous {{in the context of}} prevailing road conditions. This was somewhat similar in principle to [...] "reasonable and prudent" [...] limits in other jurisdictions. This led to the widespread but misleading belief that no limit applied, and that <b>derestriction</b> signs indicated an [...] "unlimited" [...] limit. This belief, coupled with repeated studies showing 85th percentile speeds in excess of 120 km/h on major routes, comparatively high road tolls, difficulty in prosecuting speeding offences, and the variance in meaning of the <b>derestriction</b> sign across states, led New South Wales to harmonise its rural default limit to 100 km/h in 1978. The use of <b>derestriction</b> signs in New South Wales was officially discouraged, and on state controlled routes, 100 km/h signs were progressively used instead.|$|E

5000|$|Often {{the start}} of rural default 'limits' or prima facie {{allowances}} were signalled by use of the speed <b>derestriction</b> sign, catalogued R4-2 in AS1742.4. (2009 edition has dropped from reference the R4-2 speed <b>derestriction).</b> The speed <b>derestriction</b> sign (//) had developed 'different meaning' over time at state and territory level, although its contract-meaning under [...] "The United Nations Convention on Road Traffic, Signs & Signals" [...] where the sign is catalogued [...] "C,17a", is; [...] "End of all local prohibitions imposed on moving vehicles" [...] and has never changed. In the Northern Territory, they designated the end of speed restrictions. In Victoria and Western Australia they meant that the rural default speed limit applied, whilst in New South Wales, they indicated that the prima facie 50 mph limit applied.|$|E

50|$|In May 2016, Zimmer backed {{and brought}} {{forward in the}} House of Commons a {{petition}} with 25 000 signatures advocating for the <b>derestriction</b> of the AR-15 semi-automatic modern sporting rifle. In {{the wake of the}} 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, this action fell under heavy criticism due to the well-publicized use of that weapon in the attack.|$|E
50|$|In some countries, <b>derestriction</b> {{signs are}} used to mark where a speed zone ends. The speed limit beyond the sign is the {{prevailing}} limit for the general area, for example the sign {{might be used to}} show the end of an urban area. In the United Kingdom, the sign means that the national speed limit applies (60 mph on open roads, 70 mph on dual carriageways and motorways). In New Zealand it means you are on an open road, but the maximum legal speed of 100 km/h still applies On roads without a general speed limits, such as German Autobahn, a portion of Stuart Highway, and rural areas on the Isle of Man, it really means end of all quantitative speed limits.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "END" [...] {{speed limit}} sign is {{increasingly}} used throughout Australia {{to signal the}} end of a posted speed restriction, or built-up area [...] "default" [...] speed-limit leading to the jurisdiction's [...] "rural" [...] default speed limit. It contains the word [...] "END" [...] and a number in a black circle beneath this, representing the ceasing speed-limit. It is typically used where, according to AS1742.4 the road beyond has certain hazards such as hidden driveways, poor camber, soft edges and other hazards where the road authority feels a posted speed limit sign might be too dangerous or otherwise unwarranted. It is intended therefore to invoke particular caution. This sign is used as a direct replacement for the slash-through speed <b>derestriction</b> signs common in Europe and elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|SLS AMG Coupé Black Series is a {{supercar}} {{version of}} SLS AMG Coupé {{inspired by the}} racing version of the SLS AMG GT3. It includes increased engine power to [...] and decreased torque to 635 Nm, increased engine's redline to 8000 rpm, fully revised high-speed valve train with modified camshafts, adapted cam geometry and optimised bucket tappets featuring a special coating which is otherwise exclusive to racing vehicles, modification of the intake air ducting (<b>derestriction</b> and adaptation to the new maximum engine speed), adaptation of the engine application and increase in peak pressure. This results in a 0-60 speed of 3.5 seconds (1/10 of a second faster than the non-Black Series SLS), and {{a top speed of}} 196 mph (1 mph slower than the non-Black series).|$|E

40|$|These {{papers were}} {{prepared}} {{in the context}} of the work programme of the Committee for Information, Computer and Communications Policy. They were considered by the Working Party on Telecommunications and Information Services Policies in 1992 and recommended for <b>derestriction</b> by the Committee in 1993. Part A of the report was prepared by Dr. Tim Kelly of the Secretariat, and Part B was prepared by Messrs. Derek Laval and Kristen Hansen of the consultancy firm Schema (United Kingdom). The information contained in this paper is valid as of the end of 1992. However, significant changes have occurred in the mobile sector since then. Nevertheless, much of the discussion and arguments in the report remain valid and, for this reason, it has been viewed as useful to make the document available to the general public...|$|E
40|$|Streptomycin-resistant mutants of an Hfr {{strain of}} Escherichia coli K were {{examined}} {{for their ability}} to support the growth of male-specific ribonucleic acid phage MS 2 and female-specific deoxyribonucleic acid phage T 7. Normally, the Hfr strain allows propagation of MS 2 and is lysed by it (efficiency of plating equal to 1), whereas the same strain restricts propagation of T 7 and is not lysed by it (efficiency of plating smaller than 10 - 7). Twenty-four isolates out of 26 independently obtained streptomycin-resistant mutants are partially or completely derestricted for propagation of T 7; efficiency of plating of T 7 in such strains ranges from 10 - 3 - 1. Depending on their response to plating of MS 2 and T 7, the streptomycin-resistant mutants can be divided into four classes. The mutants in all four classes continue to be "male" in conjugation with F- strains. Genetic analysis is presented to show that restriction of MS 2, <b>derestriction</b> of T 7, and resistance to streptomycin are the pleiotropic effects of a single mutation at the strA locus...|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} of herd breakdown (HBD) with bovine tuberculosis (bTB) {{has continued to}} increase year on year since the 1980 s in Great Britain. The management of bTB constitutes a major challenge for government and the cattle industry. Whilst various factors have been implicated with the risk of HBD with bTB, factors involved in recovery are less well described. In this paper, we used a multilevel multistate model to identify the factors affecting {{the probability of a}} herd being placed under restriction following a bTB outbreak and the factors involved in those restrictions being lifted. By modelling both transitions within the same model, we control for unobserved herd-specific characteristics, and investigate the frequency of change between the restricted and derestricted states. There were two patterns of herd breakdown: transient (characterised by fast cycling between restricted and derestricted states) and continuous (characterised by rare changes between the two states). The risk of a herd being placed under restriction was dominated by predictors related to cattle movements. The probability of <b>derestriction</b> increased with more regular testing. Some risks affected both transitions, namely log(e) mean size of neighbouring herds in the test-year, whether the herd bred its own replacements and the foot and mouth disease indicator of whether a bTB test was done between February 2002 and January 2003, possibly because the underlying true state of the herd, as infected or not, meant that these factors increased or reduced the risk of HBD. These results highlight that management of bTB is dependent on the true underlying herd status of bTB infection and that some confusion of the benefits or otherwise of some management practices, e. g. using home bred replacements can be explained by this underlying status...|$|E
