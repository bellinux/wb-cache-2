40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Civil Engineering for the MSc in Environmental Engineering and ManagementEastern Coastal Towns of AmparaDistrict(ECTAD) Water Supply Project has been planned to implement in two phases. The {{first phase of the}} project, having capacity of 17, 500 t:/day was commissioned in June 2001 The second phase was commissioned in June 2007 and it has a capacity of 72, 000 m:/day. In phase I the treatment process in the plant consists of Coagulation and Flocculation,Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF), Rapid Sand Filtration, Post Chlorination,ph Correction and Sludge Treatment. The treatment process for the phase II is the same, except for pre- chlorination and addition of powdered activated carbon (PAC) at the <b>flash</b> <b>mixer.</b> The scheme serves the Ampara Township, too. The first recorded water quality issue of coloured water, bad smell and taste were raised by consumers in the year 2004. From 2004, sporadic complaints from consumers were received and steps were taken to flush the pipelines periodically. The regular water quality tests had not revealed the cause for the problem and a series of studies have been carried out and various reports have been submitted. However, the water quality issues still persist. Therefore, four numbers of trials were carried out for collecting the samples to identify the reason for the colour problem with following conditions at the various location of the treatment processes such as the rapid mixing, before DAF,after DAF(floated water), filtered and treated water. > With pre chlori nation and with PAC, > With pre chlori nation and without PAC, > With out pre chllorination and with PAC > With out chlorination without PAC Water samples were collected at various location of the treatment processes like, rapid mixing, before DAF,after DAF(floated water), filtered and treated water. The water samples were tested at NWSDBAmpara,University of Moratuwa and NWSDB central laboratory for parameters such as total iron, dissolved iron, total manganese, dissolved manganese, total organic carbon and chemical oxygen demand.

40|$|Water is {{precious}} for every living being. It covers almost 75 % of the earth's surface, t Only about 3 % {{of the water}} on earth exists as fresh-water {{and most of it}} is not easily available to men. Freshwater sources are polluted by activities of men, animals and by natural disasters. Water pollution is dominated by industrial and domestic wastes through channels and drains. Treating this water to meet standards of drinking quality is a huge task and a costly process. ^ Many countries face the problem of providing safe drinking water rapidly when faced with disaster situations like thousands of refugees as a result of civil disturbances, or natural disasters such as tsunami-related events, earthquakes, landslides, droughts or in an event of floods. The main issue is to construct water treatment plants which are heavy concrete structures in a shorter period of time in a limited land space. •The R & D section of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (N. W. S. & D. B) has designed and fabricated a moveable water treatment plant using locally available materials and expertise within an affordable capital cost. Three of these mobile type water treatment plants have being installed in Pugoda, Mahiyangana and Allauwwa. This type of water treatment plants can dismantle into separate sections. They are fabricated steel tanks as middle stages of water treatment plant array. These sections can be transported to another place, re-assembled and re-located. The Pugoda plant has a mechanical <b>flash</b> <b>mixer</b> and three speed mechanical tapered flocculators. Flocculating is done by four paddle rotors rotated by geared motors in three speeds in three adjacent tanks. These paddle wheels (rotors) are mounted on a horizontal axis * inside the tank. The two ends of axel are sealed and supported by two end bearings housed beside the tank steel wall. This arrangement of the paddle wheels gives many operational and maintenance difficulties when dismantling the bearings and water seals. Very frequently chemically mixed water leaks through the water seals and bearings. This leads to reduce productivity by reducing bearing life, equipment safety and increasing down time, power requirement and operational cost. It needs a substantial quantity of water to remove the sludge in the bottom bed by washing them out. The objective of this special study is to study the ways and means of improving the present installation arrangements of flocculator paddle wheels and to propose an alternative arrangement eliminating above operational difficulties. Objective is to find an efficient alternative mechanical flocculator system to be used in package-type water treatment plants. This report discusses about conventional water treatment arrangement, a brief study of floe forming phenomena, specification of the mobile water treatment plant, flocculator types and other arrangement types of mechanical flocculators used elsewhere in the world. The report includes theoretical aspects of power requirement for rotating paddles. The study also proposes a vertical arrangement of flocculating. This is by fabricating frame and a plate to mount the gear box and motor. This frame is fitted on to the top frame of the tank. The axes of the paddle wheel is supported by two bearings, one is top of the channel section and the other is submerged in the water. The housing shall be fixed to fabricated plate to bottom of tank. The bearing shall be water resistant type and fully water tight by seals. The advantages expected from this arrangement are to prevent water leaks, long life of seals, bearings and couplings and to reduce operational and maintenance difficulties thus reducing operational costs and reducing the amount of sludge washing water...|$|E
40|$|Unsafe {{drinking}} {{water is a}} major cause of disease in developing countries. Lack of adequate water treatment and delivery infrastructure, high operational costs and poor maintenance are some of the factors contributing to the problem. Many developing countries also have large population clusters in cities and inadequate sanitation services, which increase the risk of water- borne disease outbreak. Incorporating renewable energy sources for treatment and distribution of potable water may be the key to developing sustainable water supply systems to reduce water- borne diseases in developing countries. This study focused on evaluating the potential of using distributed solar for a 4. 5 million gallons per day (MGD) existing {{drinking water}} treatment plant (DWTP), located in Sindh, Pakistan. The DWTP utilized a conventional treatment train, consisting of coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection processes to treat water obtained from the Indus River. The DWTP was sized by designing the various unit processes involved and then the energy consumption associated with each unit process was determined. The results showed that the energy consumption was largest for the <b>flash</b> and rapid <b>mixers.</b> Existing land holdings were sufficient for the deployment of solar photovoltaics (PV) which was successfully incorporated into the design of the DWTP...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} water {{treatment}} plants consist of coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and filtration. PAC {{is added to}} water in <b>flash</b> <b>mixer</b> basin on process of water treatment, but it increases the content of sludge in the same time. Dealing with sludge of the water treatment plat {{is a big problem}} in Taiwan. The main way of dealing with sludge is reclamation now. The reclamation are mostly reused as cement material, brick manufacture and cultivate soil. Moreover, sintering of lightweight aggregate is one way of the reclamation. This study took sludge from the six water treatment plants as material to make lightweight aggregate. Before the test of sintered lightweight aggregate, we analyzed fundamental properties including the composing and physical character of the sludge. The chemical composition of six water treatment sludge were similar and major composition included SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3; besides, it could be situated at C. M. Riley three-phase diagram. The result of toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) was in line with standard. According to physical character, the specific gravity of six sludge were similar to general soil and all sludge were silt or clay which have plasticity and fine diameter. After the sintered test at the laboratory, we found the best sintered temperature and produced the sintered lightweight aggregate having pellet density below 1. 8 g/cm 3 and water absorption below 20 ％, which passed the requirement of the general lightweight aggregate. By changing the preheated temperature, we could discover that the sludge from Hsinch, Linnei, Kaotan, Chengcing lake water treatment plant could make the lightweight aggregate for structural and non-structural application in the same time, in the other hand, the sludge from Shinshan and Banxin only made lightweight aggregate for non-structural application. This study discovered the sludge from the six water treatment plants could be the material of sintered lightweight aggregate. 淨水場自河川、水庫或地下水取得源水後，經由廠內混凝、膠凝、沉澱及過濾等淨水處理程序，其處理過程中為降低濁度或去除污染物常添加藥劑混凝（PAC），但同時也產生大量的淨水污泥，而淨水污泥屬於公告事業廢棄物不可隨意棄置，因此大量淨水污泥處理問題為此時有待解決之課題。淨水污泥資源化再利用已成為發展趨勢，台灣現今淨水污泥多做為水泥原料、培養土、紅磚等再利用方式，而燒製成輕質骨材亦為一種再利用方式。 本研究採集國內 6 座淨水場污泥做為原料，對淨水污泥再製輕質骨材之可行性進行研究。於燒製試驗前，先對淨水污泥之組成性質及物理性質進行分析。化學成分分析上， 6 場淨水污泥化學成分均相似，主體成分為SiO 2 、Al 2 O 3 及Fe 2 O 3 ，且皆位於C. M. Riley三相圖合適範圍內。由TCLP溶出試驗可知， 6 場淨水污泥皆屬於一般事業廢棄物，故淨水污泥可認定為穩定無害的無機性污泥。在物理性質探討上， 6 場污泥之比重與一般土壤比重相近，且為具可塑性粒徑細緻之粉土或粘土質沉積物。因此可知 6 場淨水場污泥皆適於作為產製輕質骨材之原料。 於實驗室進行輕質骨材燒製試驗後發現， 6 場淨水污泥皆可燒製出顆粒密度小於 1. 8 g/cm 3 之輕質骨材，且吸水率皆小於 20 ％，皆符合一般工程應用輕質骨材之要求。再經由變化預熱段時間燒製試驗發現，新竹場、林內場、拷潭場及澄清湖場等 4 場淨水污泥，可同時產製出結構用及非結構用輕質骨材；新山場及板新場，只可產製出結構用輕質骨材。中文摘要	I ABSTRACT	II 目錄	III 表目錄	VI 圖目錄	VIII 照片目錄	X 第一章 緒論	 1 1. 1 前言	 1 1. 2 研究目的及方法	 2 第二章 文獻回顧	 4 2. 1 淨水污泥	 4 2. 1. 1 淨水污泥來源	 4 2. 1. 2 淨水污泥特性	 5 2. 1. 3 淨水污泥化學特性與組成	 6 2. 1. 4 淨水污泥處理方式	 8 2. 1. 5 淨水污泥現況及再利用	 12 2. 2 輕質骨材	 22 2. 2. 1 輕質骨材概述	 22 2. 2. 2 人造輕質骨材生產方式	 25 2. 2. 3 人造輕質骨材之膨脹機理	 28 2. 2. 4 影響輕質骨材燒成因子	 31 第三章 試驗規劃	 34 3. 1 淨水污泥來源	 34 3. 2 污泥之物理性質分析	 36 3. 3 污泥之組成性質	 39 3. 4 淨水污泥輕質骨材燒製試驗	 41 3. 5 輕質骨材基本性質試驗	 44 第四章 試驗結果與討論	 46 4. 1 淨水污泥來源	 46 4. 2 淨水污泥之物理性質	 47 4. 3 淨水污泥之組成性質	 49 4. 4 實驗室試燒	 55 4. 4. 1 第一階段	 56 4. 4. 2 第二階段	 64 第五章 結論與建議	 71 5. 1 結論	 71 5. 2 建議	 72 文獻資料	 73 表目錄 表 2 - 1 淨水污泥種類與特性	 5 表 2 - 2 淨水污泥的化學成分表	 7 表 2 - 3 淨水污泥的毒性特性溶出試驗（TCLP）	 7 表 2 - 4 脫水方式優缺點比較	 11 表 2 - 5 不同脫水方式其含水率比較	 11 表 2 - 6 台灣自來水公司 99 年度淨水污泥再利用	 13 表 2 - 7 淨水污泥再利用的方式與優缺點	 16 表 2 - 8 主要常用的輕質骨材	 24 表 2 - 9 輕質骨材之種類與基本物理性質	 24 表 2 - 10 燒製類型之比較	 25 表 2 - 11 粘土中可能的發氣物質	 30 表 2 - 12 碳酸鹽類分解溫度	 30 表 2 - 13 金屬氧化物及其共晶混合物的熔融溫度	 32 表 4 - 1 淨水污泥來源	 46 表 4 - 2 淨水污泥之物理性質	 48 表 4 - 3 試驗用淨水污泥化學成分	 50 表 4 - 4 試驗用淨水污泥TCLP溶出試驗結果	 55 表 4 - 5 第一階段試燒結果	 56 表 4 - 6 各場淨水污泥之膨脹溫度區間及軟化溫度	 63 表 4 - 7 第二階段試燒結果	 64 表 4 - 8 各場污泥可達顆粒密度範圍	 70 圖目錄 圖 1. 1 研究流程圖	 3 圖 2 - 1 淨水場自來水處理流程	 4 圖 2 - 2 淨水污泥再利用方式	 15 圖 2 - 3 大型旋窯	 27 圖 2 - 4 原料三相圖	 29 圖 3 - 1 試驗流程圖	 35 圖 4 - 1 粒徑分佈曲線	 48 圖 4 - 2 試驗用淨水污泥化學成分三相圖落點	 51 圖 4 - 3 新山/板新XRD分析圖譜	 52 圖 4 - 4 新竹/林內 XRD分析圖譜	 53 圖 4 - 5 拷潭/澄清湖XRD分析圖譜	 54 圖 4 - 6 第一階段試燒結果—新山淨水場	 57 圖 4 - 7 第一階段試燒結果—板新淨水場	 58 圖 4 - 8 第一階段試燒結果—新竹淨水場	 59 圖 4 - 9 第一階段試燒結果—林內淨水場	 60 圖 4 - 10 第一階段試燒結果—拷潭淨水場	 61 圖 4 - 11 第一階段試燒結果—澄清湖淨水場	 62 圖 4 - 12 各場淨水污泥燒製所得輕質骨材	 65 圖 4 - 13 各場淨水污泥燒製所得輕質骨材之顆粒密度	 66 圖 4 - 14 各場淨水污泥燒製所得輕質骨材之吸水率	 67 圖 4 - 15 骨材之顆粒密度及吸水率與預熱時間之關係	 68 圖 4 - 16 各場淨水污泥燒製所得輕質骨材之體積膨脹率	 69 圖 4 - 17 燒失量比較	 70 照片目錄 照片 2 - 1 曬乾床	 9 照片 2 - 2 帶濾式脫水機	 9 照片 2 - 3 板框壓濾式脫水機	 9 照片 2 - 4 圓盤造粒機	 26 照片 2 - 5 擠壓式造粒機	 26 照片 3 - 1 淨水污泥貯放區	 34 照片 3 - 2 攪拌器	 37 照片 3 - 3 比重計	 37 照片 3 - 4 液限儀	 38 照片 3 - 5 製作之雛粒	 41 照片 3 - 6 實驗室高溫電爐	 43 照片 3 - 7 二氧化鋁匣缽	 4...|$|E
