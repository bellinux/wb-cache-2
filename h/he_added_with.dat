25|$|With eight {{recognised}} batsmen Australia {{could expect}} a large total even though Simpson {{insisted that they}} make their runs quickly {{and by the end}} of the second day they were 333/3 with the captain 159 not out. Even Bill Lawry responded with 9 fours and a six in his 119 as he and Simpson put on 244 runs in 255 minutes for the first wicket, more than the entire England first innings. This remained the highest opening partnership for Australia against England until Mark Taylor and Geoff Marsh made 329 for the first wicket in the Fifth Test of the 1989 Ashes series and remains Australia's highest opening stand against England at home. Grahame Thomas made 52 of the 87 runs <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>with</b> Simpson as Australia passed 300 for the loss of one wicket. Jeff Jones (6/118) put up a fight, dismissing Thomas, Tom Veivers, Peter Burge, Ian Chappell, Simpson and Keith Stackpole, who made 43 batting at number eight. Simpson was finally out after batting for 545 minutes, hitting 18 fours and a six in his 225 as Australia made 516 to give them a lead of 275 runs.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{were having}} {{difficulty}} choosing between an out-of-form Jason Gillespie (8 wickets at a bowling average of 50.37 in the ODIs) {{and an almost}} equally out-of-form Michael Kasprowicz (7 wickets at 34.29), and thus this match with Leicestershire was a fight between the two to keep the place in the Test team. But the two almost exclusively failed to take wickets, with only Brett Lee and Stuart MacGill taking more than two for the match. Lee opened the game by removing Darren Robinson lbw for a golden duck, and Leicestershire eventually subsided for 217 - Australian Chris Rogers top-scoring with 56, Lee taking four for 53. Australia then amassed 582 for 7 over {{the next day and}} a half, Justin Langer (115), Ricky Ponting (119) and Damien Martyn with an unbeaten 154 all making centuries. However, it was Rogers who was to make the highest score of the match, as <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>with</b> Robinson for 247 for the first wicket - and went on to make a career highest score of 209, {{right in front of the}} Australian selectors. When the fifth Leicestershire wicket fell with the Leicestershire score on 363, both teams agreed to a draw.|$|E
500|$|Steinbock's {{relevance}} also lies in {{his background}} and profession, illustrating Balzac's {{conception of the}} Polish people, as well as himself. Having {{spent more than a}} decade befriending Mme. Hanska and visiting her family in Poland, Balzac believed he had insight into the national character (as he felt about most groups he observed). Thus, descriptions of Steinbock are often laced with commentary about the Polish people: [...] "Soyez mon amie, dit-il avec une de ces démonstrations caressantes si familières aux Polonais, et qui les font accuser assez injustement de servilité." [...] ("'Be my sweetheart,' <b>he</b> <b>added,</b> <b>with</b> one of the caressing gestures familiar to the Poles, for which they are unjustly accused of servility.") ...|$|E

2500|$|Fresh & Easy began {{testing a}} new concept under the Wild Oats banner at a single store in Scottsdale, Arizona in February 2015. The [...] store opened on February 6 and “...will help us garner {{insights}} and learnings about the [...] brand and give customers even more options to shop for healthy convenience items," [...] said a company spokesman. He said Fresh & Easy {{had no plans to}} put the Wild Oats name on any additional stores. Fresh & Easy decided to test the new Wild Oats concept in Scottsdale, the spokesman said, “because the original Wild Oats chain had a long history stores there and we felt consumers there would be excited to have us use it as a test market.” The test is open-ended, <b>he</b> <b>added,</b> <b>with</b> no specific timeframe. The store is formally called Wild Oats by Fresh & Easy.|$|E
2500|$|Both sides {{agreed to}} form an investigative {{committee}} to [...] "re-examine" [...] the Buddhist grievances and Diệm agreed to grant a full amnesty to all Buddhists who had protested against the government. The agreement stated the [...] "normal and purely religious activity" [...] could go unhindered {{without the need for}} government permission in pagodas or the headquarters of the General Association of Buddhists. Diệm promised an inquiry into the Huế shootings and punishment for any found guilty, although it denied government involvement. In an attempt to save face, Diệm signed the agreement directly under a paragraph declaring that [...] "the articles written in this joint communiqué have been approved in principle by me from the beginning", which <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>with</b> his own handwriting, thereby implying that he had nothing to concede. The Communique was also signed by the members of the committee: Tho, Thuan and Luong as well as the members of the Buddhist delegation.|$|E

60|$|SERGIUS (speaking to himself). Which {{of the six}} is {{the real}} man?--that's the {{question}} that torments me.

(He pauses and looks furtively at Louka, as <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> <b>with</b> deep bitterness) And one, at least, is a coward--jealous, like all cowards. (He goes to the table.) Louka.|$|R
