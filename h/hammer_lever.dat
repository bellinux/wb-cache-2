50|$|Hammer and gong - The <b>hammer</b> <b>lever</b> (F) is {{actuated}} by pins or teeth (G) {{on one of}} the striking train wheels. As the wheel turns the pin lifts the <b>hammer</b> <b>lever,</b> until the lever slips off the pin, allowing the hammer to drop, hitting the gong (E). Early house clocks used traditional hemispherical shaped bells. Later house clocks used gongs made of long steel tubes or bars, which have a sound more like large church bells. Mantel and other small clocks use thick hardened steel wires, which are coiled into a spiral to save space.|$|E

5000|$|Type D is a double-action-only (DAO) pistol. The hammer {{follows the}} slide to the uncocked {{position}} with every shot, requiring a double-action trigger pull for each shot. There is no manual safety, half-cock hammer notch, or <b>hammer</b> drop <b>lever.</b> The Type D is a self-loading pistol that operates like a [...] "hammerless" [...] double-action revolver. The Type D has an exposed hammer but it cannot be manually cocked.|$|R
5000|$|Type F is a double/single-action (DA/SA) pistol with {{a manual}} safety that {{also serves as}} a <b>hammer</b> {{decocking}} <b>lever.</b> It operates {{in the same way as}} the Beretta 92F (M9) service pistol. Pushing the slide mounted safety lever down returns the hammer to its [...] "down" [...] position and also disconnects the trigger so that the pistol cannot be fired until the safety lever is pushed up into the [...] "fire" [...] position. There is also a half-cock safety notch.|$|R
2500|$|Produced by Beistegui Hermanos in Eibar, Spain, {{this was}} the first pseudo-Mauser on the market, a {{relatively}} crude semi-auto appearing in 1926 and full-auto variants appearing in 1927. Mechanically, it was laid out approximately like the Mauser original, but without the removable lock frame. Internal parts (trigger, <b>hammer,</b> safety <b>lever,</b> etc.) pivoted on pins and screws extending through the frame. The screws also held the frame together. The bolt was of round cross-section, unlike the square Mauser bolt. The weapon was stamped with either [...] "Royal" [...] or [...] "ETAI".|$|R

50|$|The {{local economy}} {{was based on}} {{agriculture}} and emigration to other countries for jobs. Further up the valley, there are numerous terraces that support intensive cultivation of vineyards and grain. In 1857, sphalerite, barite and stibnite were discovered and mined for several decades. On the right flank {{in the area of}} Miglieglia is the so-called Maglio power hammer. It was built in 1860 in Aranno and is the only functional power <b>hammer</b> with a <b>lever</b> device in Switzerland. It was bought by a preservation society and renovated.|$|R
5000|$|The Remington is a single-action, six-shot, {{percussion}} revolver {{produced by}} E. Remington & Sons, Ilion, N.Y., {{based on the}} Fordyce Beals patent of September 14, 1858 (Patent 21,478). The Remington Army revolver is large-framed, in [...]44 caliber, with an 8 inch barrel length. The Remington Navy revolver is slightly smaller framed than the Army, and in [...]36 caliber with an 7.375 inch Navy 7.5 inch barrel length. There were three progressive models made; the Remington-Beals Army & Navy (1860-1862), the 1861 Army & Navy (1862-1863), and the New Model Army & Navy (1863-1875). The three models are nearly identical in size and appearance. Subtle but noticeable differences in <b>hammers,</b> loading <b>levers,</b> and cylinders help identify each model. The 1861 Remington actually transitioned into New Model appearance by late 1862, slowly transforming throughout 1862, due to continual improvement suggestions from the U. S. Ordnance Department.|$|R
60|$|As day dawned the {{destruction}} {{which had been}} wrought was clearly visible. The doors were in splinters, the lower window frames were all smashed in, scarce a pane of glass remained in its place throughout the whole building, the stonework was dotted and splashed with bullet marks, the angles of the windows were chipped and broken, there were dark patches of blood in many places in the courtyard, and the yard itself and the roads leading from the mill were strewn with guns, picks, <b>levers,</b> <b>hammers,</b> and pikes, which had been thrown away by the discomfited rioters in their retreat.|$|R
5000|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{characteristic of}} LeMat's revolver {{is that its}} 9-shot cylinder revolves around a separate central barrel of larger caliber than the chambers in the cylinder proper. The central barrel is smooth-bore and can function as a short-barreled shotgun (hence the name [...] "Grape Shot Revolver") with the shooter selecting whether to fire from the cylinder or the smooth-bore barrel by flipping a lever {{on the end of}} the <b>hammer.</b> Flipping the <b>lever</b> up caused the movable striker to fall upon the primer set directly under the hammer, discharging the lower barrel, while leaving it in the standard position would fire the chambers in the cylinder, much like any other revolver.|$|R
25|$|The {{standard}} {{models have}} an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker {{located on the}} slide; when the safety lever is lowered to the safe position, the firing pin is cammed into the slide away from the hammer, the trigger is disconnected from the sear, and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered, it only cams the firing pin into the slide and drops the <b>hammer.</b> When the <b>lever</b> is released, the firing pin springs back to the normal position. The DAO models have no manual safety or decocker. All models feature an automatic firing pin safety that blocks the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{theoretical}} and experimental analysis of hammer forging process of lever drop forging from AZ 31 magnesium alloy {{are presented in}} this paper. In order to design a process guaranteeing obtaining a proper product, numerous simulations were made, in which material flow kinematics, strain and damage criterion distributions and forging energy were analyzed. On {{the basis of the}} obtained results, the analysis of limiting phenomena, which could appear during the process, was made. Experimental tests in industrial conditions according to designed technology were carried out. Good quality of drop forgings were obtained. On the basis of conducted research, it was stated that <b>hammer</b> forging of <b>lever</b> drop forging from AZ 31 magnesium alloy is possible...|$|R

5000|$|Designed by Kenny [...] "Von Dutch" [...] Howard, an {{experienced}} artist and gunsmith, the original mare's leg {{was made by}} cutting down a [...]44-40 caliber Winchester Model 1892 rifle to a size that could be worn in a large leg holster and used with one hand. The barrel was cut to a length of nine inches, {{and much of the}} butt-stock was removed. The original mare's leg did not have sights. McQueen was involved in the final design, suggesting the duck-bill <b>hammer</b> and enlarged <b>lever</b> loop, and initiating a redesign of the custom holster. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms was not consulted before the program aired and producers had to pay taxes totalling $1100.|$|R
50|$|The MAG-95 pistol relies to a {{large extent}} on design {{features}} from the later Browning designs, and others, combining features from several weapons into one pistol. The locking system is the widely used dropping barrel and cam action of the Browning series. This is combined with a double-action trigger mechanism combined with a <b>hammer</b> decocking <b>lever</b> which allows the external hammer to be lowered in safety when a round is chambered. Only a positive 50 N pull on the trigger will allow the hammer to recock for firing the round. The barrel is chrome plated to prolong its life and to permit easier cleaning. The MAG-95 is suitable for use by both right and left-handed users and is designed for two-handed operation. It is claimed that the pistols are well balanced to produce greater accuracy when rapid firing. The box magazine contains 15 rounds; optional 20 and 10-round magazines are available. Other options include a laser target indicator to be mounted in front of the trigger guard. The standard finish is a matte black lacquer coating but a bright or matte chrome finish is optional. The MAG-98 incorporates a buffer while the MAG-98c, also with a buffer, is primarily a sporting pistol.|$|R
5000|$|The Colt-Burgess rifle {{is similar}} in design to Winchester's lever-action rifles, such as the Winchester Model 1873. It was {{produced}} in two versions chambered for the [...]44-40 Winchester cartridge: a rifle version with a 25+1/2 in barrel, and a carbine with a 20 in barrel. [...] The rifle features either a full octagon, half-octagon, or round barrel, with the full octagon barrels being the most numerously produced among rifle variants. [...] A tubular magazine is located under the barrel in similar fashion to other lever-action rifles with a capacity of 15 rounds in the rifle version or 12 rounds in the carbine version. The receiver on the Burgess rifle is smaller than the Winchester 1873's, providing for a lighter firearm. The rifle's action, though similar to the Winchester 1873's, {{is considered to be}} a stronger design. The action utilizes a toggle-joint system to lock the breechblock. The extension of the loading lever is the lower part of the toggle-joint; the upper part of the toggle-joint is linked to the breechblock. Located on the receiver is a sliding loading gate from which cartridges are fed into the magazine; the sliding gate design is in contrast to Winchester's tilting gate. Burgess rifles are finished with either a blued or browned barrel featuring walnut stock and case hardened receiver, <b>hammer,</b> and <b>lever.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The unfluted {{cylinder}} was [...] "rebated", {{meaning that}} {{the rear of the}} cylinder was turned to a smaller diameter than the front. The barrel was rounded and smoothed into the frame, as was the Navy Model. The frame, <b>hammer,</b> and rammer <b>lever</b> were case-hardened, the remainder blued; grips were of one-piece walnut; and the trigger guard and front grip strap were of brass while the backstrap was blued."A distinguishing feature of the Model 1860 was that its frame had no top strap, or no component running above the cylinder. Instead, its strength came from the lower frame and the massive fixed cylinder pin. This made the gun slimmer and lighter than its main competitor, the Remington Model 1858, but with a possible loss of strength. The fixed cylinder pin also meant that the barrel had to be removed to remove the cylinder, unlike the Model 1858, which only required removal of the cylinder retaining pin.|$|R
5000|$|The Tanfoglio Combat/Standard {{is a short}} recoil operated, locked breech {{semi-automatic}} pistol {{that uses}} a Browning Hi-Power style linkless system.All T95 Standard and Combat models have the capability of being fired single- and double-action.The T95 Combat models feature an ambidextrous frame-mounted combat [...] "switch" [...] style manual safety that locks the sear so the trigger cannot be moved rearward {{as well as an}} internal firing pin block safety which stops the firing pin from traveling forward. The manual safety allows the Combat models to be carried with the hammer back, ready for use just by switching the safety off, a configuration known as condition one. The T95 Standard models feature slide mounted <b>hammer</b> drop safety/decocker <b>lever</b> (ambidextrous as an option).Unlike most other semi-automatic pistols, the Tanfoglio Combat/Standard slide rides inside the frame rails rather than outside, similar to the SIG P210. This provides a very tight slide-to-frame fit, very good barrel lock-up and contributes to accuracy. A new slide with a slide-mounted safety/decocker lever is available as a factory option. Most variants have fixed iron sights with three dots for increased visibility that can be adjusted for windage. The Tanfoglio Combat/Standard models feature high capacity [...] "double stack" [...] magazines.|$|R
2500|$|Glock pistols are {{designed}} with three independent safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge. The system, designated [...] "Safe Action" [...] by Glock, consists of an external integrated trigger safety and two automatic internal safeties: a firing pin safety, and a drop safety. The external safety is a small inner lever contained in the trigger. Pressing the lever activates the trigger bar and sheet metal connector. The firing pin safety is a solid hardened steel pin that, in the secured state, blocks the firing pin channel (disabling the firing pin in its longitudinal axis). It is pushed upward to release the firing pin for firing only when the trigger is actuated and the safety is pushed up through the backward movement of the trigger bar. The drop safety guides the trigger bar in a ramp that is released only when direct rearward pressure {{is applied to the}} trigger. The three safety mechanisms are automatically disengaged one after the other when the trigger is squeezed, and are automatically reactivated when the trigger is released. This passive safety system omits the manipulation of traditional on-off <b>levers,</b> <b>hammers,</b> or other external safeties as found in many other handgun designs. The ability to fire immediately, without worrying about an external safety, is one feature Glock has stressed as an advantage when selling its guns, especially to police departments.|$|R
50|$|In 1997 Mark Lehner and Roger Hopkins, a stonemason from Sudbury, Massachusetts, {{teamed up}} to conduct a pyramid-building {{experiment}} for a NOVA television episode. They built a pyramid 6 m high by 9 m wide, consisting {{of a total of}} , or about 405 tons, it was made out of 186 stones weighing an average of 2.2 tons each. They had a total of just over 3 weeks to build it, due to their filming schedule. 12 quarrymen carved 186 stones in 22 days. They were able to erect it using 44 men. They used iron <b>hammers,</b> chisels and <b>levers</b> (this is a modern short-cut, the ancient Egyptians were limited to using copper and later bronze and wood). But they did experiments with copper tools, noting that they were adequate for the job in hand, only provided that additional manpower was available to constantly re-sharpen the ancient tools. They estimated they would have needed around 20 extra men for this maintenance. Another short-cut taken was the use of a front end loader or fork lift truck. However, modern machinery was not and could not be used to finish the construction. They used levers to lift the capstone to a height of 20 ft. Four or five men were able to use levers on stones less than 1 ton to flip them over and transport them by rolling them. For the larger stones, they had to tow them. They found that by putting the stones on wooden sledges and sliding the sledges on wooden tracks, they were able to tow a 2-ton stone with 12 to 20 men. The wood for these sledges and tracks would have to have been imported from Lebanon at great cost since there was little, if any, wood in ancient Egypt. While the builders failed to duplicate the precise jointing created by the ancient Egyptians, Hopkins was confident this could have been achieved with more practice.|$|R
