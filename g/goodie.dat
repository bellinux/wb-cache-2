40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen the rise of musical corpus studies, {{primarily}} detailing harmonic tendencies of tonal music. This article extends this scholarship by addressing a new genre (rap music) and a new parameter of focus (rhythm). More specifically, I use corpus methods to investigate the relation between metric ambivalence in the instrumental parts of a rap track (i. e., the beat) and an emcee's rap delivery (i. e., the flow). Unlike virtually every other rap track, the instrumental tracks of Outkast's "Mainstream" (1996) simultaneously afford hearing both a four-beat and a three-beat metric cycle. Because three-beat durations between rhymes, phrase endings, and reiterated rhythmic patterns are rare in rap music, an abundance of them within a verse of "Mainstream" suggests that an emcee highlights the three-beat cycle, especially if that emcee is not prone to such durations more generally. Through the construction of three corpora, one representative of the genre as a whole, and two that are artist specific, I show how the emcee T-Mo <b>Goodie's</b> expressive practice highlights the rare three-beat affordances of the track...|$|R
25|$|Atlanta-based OutKast proved one of {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} Hip-Hop groups from outside of New York City or Los Angeles. In the 1990s and 2000s, Atlanta emerged as the leading center of urban music. Artists like TLC, Usher, 112, T.I., Ludacris, YoungBloodZ, OutKast, <b>Goodie</b> Mob (as well as the Dungeon Family music collective of which both are members), and producers like Organized Noize, L.A. Reid, and Jermaine Dupri, the later of whom founded the successful record labels LaFace and SoSo Def, have blurred musical boundaries by blending R singing with Hip-Hop production. More recently, Atlanta is also known as a center of crunk music, an electric bass-driven club music, whose most visible practitioner has been Atlanta-based producer/hype man/rapper Lil Jon. Before moving to Atlanta, Young Jeezy lived in Macon, Georgia.|$|E

[...] ITT/Continental Baking sold the company to an out-of-state {{confectionery}} partnership in 1979.

500|$|After {{the album}} was {{certified}} platinum, LaFace Records gave OutKast more creative control and advanced money for their 1996 follow-up album ATLiens. After acquiring their own recording studio, the duo immediately started working on new material and assimilated themselves with music recording and studio equipment, as they sought to become more ambitious artists and less dependent on other producers. The two also became more accustomed to playing live, particularly Big Boi, and André 3000 significantly changed his lifestyle, as he adopted a more eccentric fashion sense, became a vegetarian, and stopped smoking marijuana. The album's success also opened up more opportunities for Organized Noize, who subsequently worked on TLC's CrazySexyCool (1994). The Organized Noize-produced hit [...] "Waterfalls" [...] became a massive success and earned the production team enough clout with LaFace to endorse <b>Goodie</b> Mob to the label. Organized Noize produced <b>Goodie</b> Mob's acclaimed 1995 debut Soul Food and continued their crossover into R production, including work on Curtis Mayfield's 1997 album New World Order.|$|E
500|$|The Jaws character, {{played by}} Richard Kiel, makes a return, {{although}} in Moonraker the role is played more for comedic effect than in The Spy Who Loved Me.

Paykel's mother did not renew her contract because, according to Paykel, [...] "Shirley Temple was all the rage and my mother was terrified I might become a public figure like her". Aeroplane Jelly held a talent quest in Sydney to find a new singer and the competition was won by five-year-old Joy King. King recorded the jingle in 1937.|$|E
500|$|Steve Jones of USA Today {{commented that}} the duo's [...] "molasses-smooth raps speak to the stark realities of urban streets." [...] Tony Green of Spin said that {{although}} {{they are not as}} spiritual as <b>Goodie</b> Mob, Outkast's [...] "streetcorner signifying" [...] offers listeners more than simple musical pleasure and that they [...] "have crafted some of the most seductive and dramadelic textures." [...] Giving it a five out of five [...] "mic"-rating, Charlie Braxton of The Source praised the duo for [...] "their superb use of the urban narrative." [...] Braxton called Aquemini [...] "a brilliant record" [...] and commented that it [...] "possesses an uncanny blend of sonic beauty, poignant lyricism and spirituality that compels without commanding".|$|E
500|$|The {{insertion}} of gems into teeth predates hip hop culture, and started {{in what is}} now Mexico when wealthy Mayans drilled pieces of jade into their teeth. Hip hop artists such as Raheem the Dream and Kilo Ali began wearing grills in the early 1980s; New Yorker Eddie Plein, owner of Eddie's Gold Teeth, is often credited with bringing the trend to New York. [...] Plein made gold caps for Flavor Flav, and then outfitted New York rappers including Big Daddy Kane and Kool G. Rap. [...] He later moved to Atlanta, where he designed ever-more-elaborate grills for rappers like OutKast, <b>Goodie</b> Mob, Ludacris, and Lil Jon. [...] Other writers have cited Slick Rick and Afrika Bambaataa as an important early contributor to the popularity of grills.|$|E
500|$|The duo {{also spent}} time at their friend Rico Wade's {{basement}} recording studio, {{known as the}} Dungeon, with Wade's production team Organized Noize and future members of hip hop group <b>Goodie</b> Mob. OutKast recorded demos at the studio, and Organized Noize member Ray Murray helped Big Boi, whose strength lay in songwriting, develop his rapping skills. After several local productions, the team was hired by LaFace Records to produce remixes to songs from TLC's 1992 album Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip. The team had André 3000 and Big Boi rap over them, {{which led to a}} record deal from LaFace for both Organized Noize and OutKast. The commercial success of Arrested Development's 1992 alternative hip hop single [...] "Tennessee" [...] also encouraged LaFace to sign OutKast, the label's first hip hop act.|$|E
500|$|The album presaged hip hop's [...] "Dirty South" [...] aesthetic, {{which later}} {{achieved}} mainstream recognition. Its smooth musical style, drawing on soul and funk musical traditions, and the duo's clever lyrics helped define Southern hip hop's sound, which influenced acts like <b>Goodie</b> Mob, Joi, and Bubba Sparxxx. In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, Rolling Stone journalist Roni Sarig {{writes that the}} album [...] "marked a coming out for a region that would dominate hip-hop by the decade's end", commenting that, with it, OutKast [...] "helped define a new stream of hip-hop that would rejuvenate the music in the late '90s and early 2000s." [...] Allmusic's Stanton Swihart comments that [...] "no one sounded like OutKast in 1994" [...] and that the album showcased Organized Noize as it [...] "began forging {{one of the most}} distinctive production sounds in popular music in the '90s".|$|E
500|$|The discography of American rapper Big Boi {{consists}} of three studio albums, one mixtape, twenty-two singles, five promotional singles and twenty-five music videos. Big Boi initially achieved success {{as a member of}} the hip hop duo Outkast with fellow rapper André 3000; they have recorded and released six studio albums together, and their singles [...] "Ms. Jackson", [...] "Hey Ya!" [...] and [...] "The Way You Move" [...] have all topped the US Billboard Hot 100. In 1995, Big Boi made a guest appearance on the single [...] "Dirty South" [...] by American hip hop group <b>Goodie</b> Mob, which peaked at number 92 on the Billboard Hot 100. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, he made several other appearances on commercially successful singles, including [...] "All n My Grill" [...] by rapper Missy Elliott, [...] "A.D.I.D.A.S." [...] by rapper Killer Mike and [...] "Girlfight" [...] by singer Brooke Valentine; these songs charted on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E
500|$|... "Y'all Scared" [...] is a {{collaboration}} with {{three members of}} <b>Goodie</b> Mob and contains the chant [...] "If you scared, say you scared" [...] accompanied by prominent organ and guitar work. [...] "Nathaniel" [...] is an a cappella rap by the group's close friend {{who at the time}} was an inmate in a Georgia prison, and the song is a recording of an actual collect call during his time in jail. The track is an introduction to [...] "Liberation". The eight-minute-long [...] "Liberation" [...] combines a variety of musical styles, including gospel, jazz, blues, and world music. The song is notable for not including rapped vocals and instead features vocal alternations between singing and spoken word styles. Lyrically, the track utilizes images of slavery to symbolize artistic freedom and not being concerned with the opinions of the public and record labels. The album closes with [...] "Chonkyfire", which features a fuzzy guitar riff and snippets from OutKast's speech at the 1995 Source Awards in which the group emphasized the Southern hip-hop scene as a legitimate subgenre.|$|E
500|$|West {{spent much}} of the late 1990s {{producing}} records for a number of well-known artists and music groups. The third song on Foxy Brown's second studio album Chyna Doll was produced by West. Her second effort subsequently became the very first hip-hop album by a female rapper to debut {{at the top of the}} U.S. Billboard 200 chart in its first week of release. West produced three of the tracks on Harlem World's first and only album The Movement alongside Jermaine Dupri and the production duo Trackmasters. His songs featured rappers Nas, Drag-On, and R singer Carl Thomas. The ninth track from World Party, the last <b>Goodie</b> Mob album to feature the rap group's four founding members prior to their break-up, was co-produced by West with his manager Deric [...] "D-Dot" [...] Angelettie. At the close of the millennium, West ended up producing six songs for Tell 'Em Why U Madd, an album that was released by D-Dot under the alias of The Madd Rapper; a fictional character he created for a skit on The Notorious B.I.G.'s second and final studio album Life After Death. West's songs featured guest appearances from rappers such as Ma$e, Raekwon, and Eminem.|$|E
500|$|Raymond Fiore of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album a B and commented, [...] "If Aaliyah had lived {{to make another}} CD, it might have sounded like Goodies," [...] and said that other album cuts [...] "prove she's no one-track pony." [...] Noting the singles [...] "Goodies," [...] "1, 2 Step," [...] and [...] "Oh" [...] as {{standout}} tracks, Allmusic gave the album {{three and a half}} out of five stars. Steve Jones of USA Today said, [...] "The voice doesn't blow you away, but as with Goodies, she takes a lyrically intriguing offbeat path from time to time. Though not every song is a <b>goodie,</b> she does have a few treats in store." [...] Even though he said the album wasn't a perfect work, Azeem Ahmad of musicOMH said, [...] "The talent is obviously there but if we are to carry out Ciara's wish of forgetting about [...] "the other chicks" [...] then there's some fine-tuning needed. For now there's no direct threat to any other hip-hop divas, but the void left by Aaliyah is still there for someone to try and fill. There's no reason why Ciara can't one day hold her own with the best." [...] Jalylah Burrell of PopMatters commented that [...] "Goodies is nothing new, but it is executed well." ...|$|E
500|$|The discography of Outkast, an American hip hop duo {{consisting}} of rappers André 3000 and Big Boi, consists of five studio albums, one compilation album, one soundtrack album, one video album, thirty-two singles (including eight as featured artists), three promotional singles and twenty-one music videos.

It was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Their following two albums, ATLiens (1996) and Aquemini (1998), were commercially successful in the United States; both albums peaked at number two on the Billboard 200, and were certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Three singles were solicited from each album; all three from ATLiens charted on the Billboard Hot 100, with [...] "Elevators (Me & You)" [...] peaking at number 12, making it the most successful.

500|$|Todo a Su Tiempo {{received}} {{praise from}} music critics. Evan Gutierrez of Allmusic gave the album a 4.5 out of 5 stars, praising the album {{as a step}} forward over Otra nota. He described Anthony's voice as [...] "soaring" [...] and [...] "luminescent". He cited the album as setting the bar for salsa music and closed the review by it calling the album [...] "without question {{one of the finest}} salsa records of the '90s".

He referred [...] "Por Amar Se da Todo" [...] as a song that [...] "doesn't let up" [...] and [...] "Nadie Como Ella" [...] as [...] "obvious, but catchy". Of the song [...] "Y Sigues Siendo Tu", Wilson said that Anthony is [...] " [...] one of the few current male singers who can really make you believe in a sappy ballad". Achy Obejas of the Chicago Tribune gave the album a four-star rating and enjoyed how Anthony put a variety of sounds, including hip-hop and R, to [...] "good use". She referred to [...] "Hasta Ayer" [...] as [...] "an oldie but <b>goodie</b> totally transformed by soulful crooning". Billboards mentioned Anthony as [...] "grafting his muy soulful baritone onto vivid romantic narratives" [...] and acknowledged [...] "Nadie Como Ella" [...] and [...] "Se Me Sigue Olvidando" [...] as [...] "upbeat".
