The formulation of the model is based on the description of the tire/wet road contact area. The friction coefficient is expressed as the product of a 'dry' friction coefficient by a function expressing the actions of water. It was stated that this function is a product of four weighting functions expressing respectively the water intrusion - due to the speed and the water depth - and the water drainage - thanks to the road surface macrotexture and the tire tread depth. It was shown that existing friction models are a special case of the proposed model. The model was calibrated by friction measurements issued from an exhaustive test campaign conducted at Ifsttar's test track. The test program includes 2 commercial tire types, 3 road surfaces, 6 speeds, 3 water depths and 3 tire tread depths. It was shown that the model fits remarkably well experimental data, except for very high water depth (8 mm) at high speed (over 80 km/h). Considering the fact that these conditions induce mechanisms like dragging that are not considered in the model and that the water depths used by <b>friction</b> <b>monitoring</b> devices generally are lower than 1 mm, it was considered that the proposed model is satisfactory.

ABSTRACT: In Total Joint Replacement (TJR), ceramic surfaces offer a major benefit of drastically reduced wear rates and excellent long-term biocompatibility with the bone tissue. Among the available ceramic materials for load bearing bio-implant applications, silicon carbide is superior for its better biocompatibility, which can increase the longevity of prosthetic joints. The major cause of revision surgery and implant failure is Osteolysis (aseptic loosening of the prosthetic joint). The product of bearing wear, microscopic particulate debris in the joint space leads to implant loosening. Prosthetic joint mainly consists of acetabular cup, acetabular lining and femoral head. The best material for manufacturing acetabular cup is nickel – base alloy. For manufacturing acetabular lining and femoral head, silicon carbide is the best chosen material. The acetabular cup or knee cap is prone to catastrophic failures due to walking, stumbling etc. A sliding distance test was performed on polished surface of silicon carbide and nickel-base alloy (mirror- like finish, 1 µm) by using Reciprocating <b>Friction</b> <b>Monitor</b> (Courtesy; National Institute of Technology, Srinagar) {{for the evaluation of}} wear volume and wear coefficient by standard test procedures and equation outlined in ASTM F 603.

The demand to reduce the use of lubricants and increase tool life in sheet metal stamping has resulted in increased research on the sliding contact between the tool and the sheet material. Hence it has been recognized that the deforming conditions, such as- normal load, sliding speed, sliding time etc. affect the performance of the operation to a greater extent. These deforming parameters are required to be carefully selected to optimize the economics and quality of operations.
