5|$|Mother hippos {{are very}} {{protective}} {{of their young}} and may keep others at a distance. However, calves are occasionally left in nurseries which are guarded by {{one or a few}} adults. Calves in nurseries engage in playfights. Weaning starts between six and eight months after birth, and most calves are fully weaned after a year. Like many other large mammals, hippos are described as K-strategists, in this case typically producing just one large, well-developed infant <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> (rather than many small, poorly developed young several times per year as is common among small mammals such as rodents).|$|E

This is based on observations of bright meteors seen {{from the ground and}} space, combined with surveys of near-Earth asteroids.

25|$|Egyptian pottery in the {{southern}} Sinai during the Late Bronze and Early Iron I (Ramesside) periods has been discovered at the mining camps of Serabit el-Khadim and Timna. Objects which bore Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions, {{the same as those}} found in Canaan, were discovered at Serabit el Khadim in the Southern Sinai. Several of these were dated in the later Bronze Age. These encampments provide evidence of miners from southern Canaan. The remote site of Serabit el-Khadem was used for a few months at a time, <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> at best, more often once in a generation. The journey to the mines was long, difficult and dangerous. Expeditions headed by Professor Mazar examined the tell of Feiran, the principal oasis, of southern Sinai and discovered the site abounded not only in Nabatean sherds but in wheel-burnished sherds typical of the Kingdom of Judah, belonging to Iron Age II.|$|E
