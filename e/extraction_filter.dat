40|$|A novel {{approach}} to multichannel signal enhancement is presented that exploits {{data from a}} remote wireless microphone (RWM). This RWM is placed near an interfering source and transmits only autocorrelation data of its observations to a host, i. e., not the entire signal.

A blind source extraction algorithm exploits this correlation data in order to identify the desired <b>extraction</b> <b>filter.</b> This novel approach has several advantages compared to transmitting the entire signal of the RWM. By transmitting only correlation data the required transmission power reduces significantly and synchronization at sample level is not required.

40|$|Introduction Inspired by the {{bandpass}} and direction-sensitive {{nature of}} the nerve cells in the visual cortex of the brain, Daugman [1] investigated {{the features of the}} two-dimensional Gabor filters. Since then, multichannel image feature <b>extraction</b> (<b>filtering)</b> and classification using Gabor filter arrays have been widely tried, especially in image texture classification problems. Feature <b>extraction</b> using Gabor <b>filters</b> amounts to estimating the power of the local Fourier transform, or the local second order moment spectra of the signal with a Gaussian window function. Due to its window shape, a Gabor filter achieves the lower limit of the joint resolution in space and frequency domains. Several papers report on using an array of Gabor filters, each tuned to different spatial frequency bands for extracting a local feature vector of the signal, and feeding them to a classifier for segmenting image regions with varying textures [2 - 4].

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} signal extraction based on conditional second-order moments of {{the output of the}} <b>extraction</b> <b>filter.</b> The estimator of the filter is derived from an approximate maximum likelihood criterion conditioned on a presence indicator of the source of interest. The conditional moment is shown to be a contrast function under the conditions that 1) all cross-moments of the same order between the source signal of interest and the other source signals are null and 2) that the source of interest has the largest conditional moment among all sources. For the two-source two-observation case, this allows us to derive the theoretical recovery bounds of the contrast when the conditional cross-moment does not vanish. A comparison with empirical results confirms these bounds. Simulations show that the estimator is quite robust to additive Gaussian distributed noise. Also through simulations, we show that the error level induced by a rough approximation of the presence indicator shows a strong similarity with that of additive noise.
