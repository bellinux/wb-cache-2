Provision was made for the allocation of scholarships {{to the value of}} the tuition fees for one in every ten boys in the school; one-half of the scholarships were arranged by the governors and awarded only to boys who had spent three years education in a public elementary school. Around the turn of the 20thcentury, an attempt was made to attract younger boys into the school by reducing fees for those under the age of 12 from £2/20s to £2 per term.|$|E
500|$|The Judd School opened as a {{day school}} for local pupils living with their parents, {{between the ages of}} eight and 16. According to the <b>foundation</b> <b>document,</b> the {{conditions}} of entry were possession of a [...] "good character" [...] and [...] "sufficient health"; sons of freemen of The Skinners' Company were given preference when the number of applicants exceeded the places available. During his tenure, William Bryant attempted to extend admission to boarders and estimated the costs to be £50 per term (including fees), but the Board of Governors rejected the idea. However, when a lack of public transport made day-to-day travel to the school impractical, boys were permitted to lodge from neighbouring villages and would stay at masters' homes or at hostels approved by the governors. Entry to the school was conditional upon a pupil passing an entrance exam, which would vary according to the age of the boy. However, the <b>foundation</b> <b>document</b> stipulated that every boy had to be able read, write from dictation and perform sums in the [...] "first four simple rules of Arithmetic, with the multiplication table".|$|E
500|$|The Judd School <b>foundation</b> <b>document,</b> {{which was}} {{approved}} by Queen Victoria on [...] 1889, stipulated that the Board of Governors had right of appointment and dismissal of the headmaster, who has the same powers {{over the rest of}} the staff. Major decisions were made by The Skinners' Company, but its powers were restricted by the Charity Commissioners, who were granted considerable powers under the Endowed Schools Act. Soon after the First World War, {{in the wake of the}} Education Act 1918, the Burnham Scale of teachers salaries came into force and the school was forced to enter into negotiations with the Kent Education Committee to meet the increased expenditure; the Court of The Skinners' Company approved the school becoming grant earning in June 1919. It became necessary to appoint a composite governing body, a third of them public representatives nominated by the Kent Education Committee, who also had some control over school affairs. Subsequently, a fee of one guinea was paid to those who attended meetings of the governing body, the first of which was held on 4February 1920, at Skinners' Hall in London.|$|E
