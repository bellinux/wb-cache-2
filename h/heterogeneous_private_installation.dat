The literature also shows that <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>private</b> information contributes significantly to price discovery for U. S. Treasury securities. In this paper, we use high frequency transaction data for 2 -, 5 -, and 10 -year Treasury notes and employ a Markov switching model to identify intraday private information flow in the U. S. Treasury market. We show that the probability of private information flow (PPIF) identified in our model effectively captures permanent price effects in U. S. Treasury securities. In addition, our results show that public information shocks and <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>private</b> information are the main factors of bond price discovery on announcement days, whereas private information and liquidity shocks play more important roles in bond price variation on non-announcement days. Most interestingly, our {{results show that the}} role of <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>private</b> information is more prominent when public information shocks are either high or low.

We introduce an explicit education market with <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>private</b> schools in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with overlapping generations and human capital accumulation. We use the model to simulate the effects of taxation on growth, intergenerational mobility, inequality, and welfare. Equalization in education expenditures reduces incentives for differentiation in the education market, with the distribution of education investments shifting towards the least productive schools. This has significant consequences on equilibrium outcomes, and highlights the importance of incorporating the role of intermediation when analyzing redistribution policies.

During an informational cascade, all traders with the same preferences choose the same action, either following the market (herding) or going against it (contrarianism). We also study financial contagion by extending our model to a two-asset economy. We show that informational cascades in one market can be generated by informational spillovers from the other. Such spillovers have pathological consequences, generating long-lasting misalignments between prices and fundamentals. herd behavior, financial contagion, social learning, informational cascades, financial crises...|$|R

Its original force can be seen to have arisen, somewhat paradoxically, from the limited rationality Lucas implicitly imposed on the policymaker s and hence the private sector s behaviour by failing to consider the rationale for the assumed policy change.

In experiments on a real-world private network, our approach identified {{operating system}} major and minor versions with accuracies of 99. 4 % and 97. 5 %, respectively, and provided significant information gain. We also show that obfuscation strategies can often be defeated due to the difficulty of manipulating data features from all protocols, especially TLS, by studying how obfuscation affects our fingerprinting system. Because devices running unpatched operating systems on private networks create significant vulnerabilities, their detection is critical; our approach achieved over 98 % accuracy at this important goal.

Following Giannitsarou (2003), we pose the question about the applicability of the representative agent hypothesis to learning. This hypothesis was widely used in learning literature at early stages to demonstrate convergence of an economic system under adaptive learning of agents to one of the rational expectations equilibria in the economy. We test these monetary policy rules in the general setup of the New Keynesian model that is a work horse of monetary policy models today. It is of interest to see that the results obtained by Evans and Honkapohja (2003 b) for the homogeneous learning case are replicated for the case when the representative agent hypothesis is lifted.
