50|$|Methods {{utilizing}} wavefront measurements or predictions can {{be considered}} an advanced approach to lens optics, where a single focal distance may not exist due to lens thickness or <b>imperfections.</b> <b>Note</b> also that for manufacturing reasons, a perfect lens has a spherical (or toroidal) surface shape though, theoretically, the ideal surface would be aspheric. Shortcomings such as these in an optical system cause what are called optical aberrations. The best-known aberrations include spherical aberration and coma. However {{there may be more}} complex sources of aberrations such as in a large telescope due to spatial variations in the index of refraction of the atmosphere. The deviation of a wavefront in an optical system from a desired perfect planar wavefront is called the wavefront aberration. Wavefront aberrations are usually described as either a sampled image or a collection of two-dimensional polynomial terms. Minimization of these aberrations is considered desirable for many applications in optical systems.|$|R

Those who chose not to gain mass were giving in, giving in to nothing; the air presses against them, creeping up and eating away space in between thighs and underneath chins.

500|$|Frusciante's {{approach}} to album composition has changed. On his early recordings, he welcomed sonic <b>imperfections,</b> <b>noting</b> that [...] "even on [...] there are off-pitch vocals and out-of-tune guitars." [...] However, on later albums such as Shadows Collide With People, he pursued the opposite: [...] "I just wanted {{everything to be}} perfect—I didn't want anything off pitch, or off time, or any unintentional this or that." [...] Frusciante views songwriting as taking time, and does not force it: [...] "If a song wants to come to me, I'm always ready to receive it, but I don't work at it." [...] Much of his solo material is first written on an acoustic or unamplified electric guitar. He also prefers to record his albums on analog tapes and other relatively primitive equipment. This preference stems from his belief that older equipment can actually speed up the recording process, and that modern computerized recording technology gives only an illusion of efficiency. Frusciante tries to streamline the recording process as much as possible, because he thinks [...] "music comes alive when [...] are creating it fast". He also enjoys the challenge of having to record something in very few takes, and believes that when musicians are unable to handle the pressure of having to record something quickly they often get frustrated or bogged down by perfectionism. With his focus on new styles of music, Frusciante describes having worked with the computer as an instrument, and having found the ability to merge old and new production techniques together. He has noted {{that there has been}} a change in how he works on an album. In the past he would work on one song at a time, but with the new [...] "Progressive Synth Pop" [...] that he has been working on, he feels much more comfortable to work within the album as a whole. He currently uses the music tracker Renoise as his main Digital audio workstation along with some drum machines, sequencers, and other hardware, along with his Doepfer, Arp, and other modular synthesizers.|$|R
40|$|A {{simplified}} {{description is}} given {{of the operation}} of a multiwire proportional chamber (MWPC) in the soft X-ray imaging application. Expressions are developed to allow the calculation {{of the distribution of}} induced charge on the cathodes of an MWPC. With extensions to permit direct comparison, the calculations are subjected to detailed experimental verification. A generalised, approximate formulation of the distribution with one independent parameter is described. The prediction of cathode system position response using the theoretical distributions is demonstrated. The available MWPC position readout methods are reviewed, and where possible their differential non-linearity is measured experimentally. A new position-sensitive cathode of good linearity and spatial resolution is presented. The effect of the wires of an MWPC on its imaging performance is briefly considered. An attempt is made to assess the contribution to MWPC spatial resolution of the range of the electrons produced initially by an X-ray absorption event in argon-methane mixtures. In conclusion, the important causes of MWPC imaging <b>imperfection</b> are <b>noted</b> and classified...|$|R

2500|$|In some situations, {{imperfection}} {{could be}} induced {{not by a}} note of the next smaller order but by an even smaller one. For instance, a breve in prolatio maior, which could {{be thought of as}} being composed of two perfect semibreves, could be imperfected by an adjacent minim, taking away one third of one of its two halves, thus reducing its total length from 6 to 5 (ex.). This was called [...] "partial imperfection" [...] (imperfectio ad partem). <b>Imperfection</b> involving <b>note</b> values two orders apart (e.g., a breve by a minim, or a longa by a semibreve) was called [...] "imperfection of an immediate part" [...] (ad partem propinquam); while the (rarer) case where it occurred across even greater distances (e.g., between a longa and a minim) was known as [...] "imperfection of a remote part" [...] (ad partem remotam, ex. [...] ). Finally, partial imperfection could also apply from both sides of a long note at once (ad partes, ex [...] ). In this way, a note that was nominally 9 beats long could be reduced to any value down to 4, or a note that was 12 beats long to any value down to 7.|$|R
30|$|As {{the final}} {{decision}} in collaborative sensing results from the combination of multiple sensing results, new opportunities emerge for attackers {{that are able to}} send manipulated sensing data. This is a major concern {{and one of the most}} fundamental security challenges that must be addressed before considering any collaborative sensing proposal to be feasible in practical terms and, in consequence, to fully achieve the benefits of CR [26]. Furthermore, as a SU might use experience learned from past to reason new behaviors and to anticipate future actions, non-detected attackers or faulty nodes may cause an impact on behavior on a long-term basis [27]. Despite this, the security aspects of spectrum sensing have in general received very little attention from research [28, 29]. As previously discussed, in this context, one must also consider the likelihood of well-behaved SUs occasionally sending wrong sensing reports due to the uncertainty of the sensing environment and also to hardware <b>imperfections.</b> We <b>note</b> that cooperation in CR environments is not limited to the sharing of sensing reports. For example, it may involve the exchange of statistical data for cooperative learning. Therefore, the remainder of our discussion and the content of Figure  3 can be generalized to the exchange and fusion of generic data.|$|R

40|$|As {{early as}} 1887 the German Agriculture Society (Deutsche Landwirtschafts-Gesellschaft DLG) {{carried out the}} first {{examination}} of food with a competition. Since the DLG was refounded in 1954 it has continued to pursue its goal {{to improve the quality}} standard of German food. The stated objective of the voluntary quality competitions for meat products, ready-to-serve meals, frozen food and delicacies, to support manufacturing and sales of highquality products, is realized by a comparative sensory analysis. Up to now, participants of the DLG Quality Competitions receive standardized expert?s reports about the condition of the product tested and any <b>imperfections</b> <b>noted,</b> but give no indication in which way these could be improved. In order for food producers to take remedial action and to further improve the quality of meat products with more definitive advice, the German Agriculture Society together with the Institute of Food Hygiene at the "Freie Universität Berlin" has suggested the development of the programme summarised below. This body of work describes the experience gained in developing the programme and documents the final results. The "Information Programme for addressing imperfections in the production of sausages" has been developed to be a multimedia compendium of "sausage technology". For each of the approximately 160 imperfections listed in DLG?s examination regulations, suggestions to remedy any imperfections in the manufacturing process are offered. This multimedia textbook was conceived for the instruction at universities, universities for applied science, vocational schools, and technical training centres, but also as a practical help for the butcher?s trade and for the meat product?s industry. The following issues have been experienced during the creation of this programme: 1. As there are approximately 160 individually mentioned imperfections listed in DLG?s examination regulations for sausages, these were assigned individual chapters. The entire text contains approximately 150 printed pages. 2. Searching for and finding information has been laid out as simply and as userfriendly as possible by a page with search function and a clear indication of search results. 3. Associated errors in sausage production are listed in entirity and hyperlinked with each other, {{in such a way that}} you can read through them in sequence. 4. Technical terms are also integrated into the text with hyperlinks to their definition, and indeed a complete dictionary of all technical terms. This "Encyclopedia of Terms" amounts to 12 printed pages. 5. The examination regulations of DLG valid at present, which have been included in the textbook, give an insight into the process of the quality examinations of DLG. 6. In order to interest as wide a group of users as possible with and elicit a good response, and taking into account current development within the IT community, programming of this multimedia textbook has been performed in such a way (in HTML and JavaScript) to allow for both online and offline usage by Internet and CD-ROM. As the target group stretches from butcher?s apprentices, through students and food technologists to butchers, in the entire programme a simple, easily comprehensible language without acronyms and abbreviations has been used. Food technology terms, however, represent key knowledge to be imparted, and for this reason the appropriate nomenclature has been deliberately included...|$|R

50|$|The alleged {{poor quality}} of the drawing had led to the {{incorrect}} belief it dates from Bosch's early period. The attribution to the discipulo was revived in the catalogue of the 2001 Bosch exhibition in Rotterdam, by Vermet and Vandenbroeck, who also suggested {{that several of the}} costumes suggest a much later date, around 1500, so that the awkward drawing and execution cannot be attributed to youthful <b>imperfection.</b> They also <b>noted</b> that the painting is not on oak, adding to their doubts about the attribution to Bosch. Nowadays, most art historians agree that the costumes point at a date in between 1505 and 1510; it is argued that the key characteristics of the underlying drawing, the way the pictorial surface was developed, and the variety of strokes are entirely consistent with Bosch's later paintings. Furthermore, the theme, symbolism and the composition itself is profoundly original, which would make it extremely unlikely that an unknown pupil could have painted it.|$|R

40|$|This report expands on {{a dynamic}} model of market {{integration}} to investigate how information is transmitted across commodities. The author investigates one property of an efficient market : the {{full use of}} available information. Studies of spatial price integration simultaneously looks at {{the flow of information}} and commodities. The author investigates the flow of information within a single spatial market and the relationship between prices in spatially separate markets. He studies intercommodity price transmittal from two perspectives. First, he asks whether the government can concentrate on a single commodity price, yet achieve policy objectives in a broader arena. This is important in Ghana because no single commodity dominates consumers'food budgets. The author finds that price movements for the main cereal consumed in the country (maize) are fully transmitted to other regions. Second, he investigates the working of commodity markets in developing countries. He <b>notes</b> <b>imperfections</b> in the way markets process information. There are several possible explanations for this market inefficiency. Traders may set prices for other coarse grains in response to information about maize prices. Another possibility is that some traders may not deal in all grains and thus have different costs of acquiring information. In short the author's dynamic model of price integration indicates functional efficiency in Ghana.
