5|$|Elements of {{the canvas}} refer to Grünewald's c. 1512–16 Isenheim Altarpiece and Peter Paul Rubens's c. 1612–14 Descent from the Cross. According to the art critic Hugh Davies, the open mouth of the victim and the {{predator}} leaning over the cross link the painting to Rubens' Descent. The mouth in Rubens' painting is loosely opened, but in Bacon's it is taut. The main figure's legs are folded out of view and the figure's left arm is passive in Rubens' painting, but in the Bacon's painting the chimera's legs and arms are in violent motion, seemingly wildly <b>flailing</b> up and down.|$|E

5|$|The {{video was}} quickly pulled after its release because it {{contained}} some technical errors. The clips {{of the people}} on Carey's television had their struggles captioned in dark text on a dark background, making it difficult to read. There were also continuity errors during the rainy balcony scene, as Carey's shirt would alternate between being soaking wet and dry. Consequently, a new music video was completed, which retained the clips of Carey's fans at the beginning but fixed the captions and replaced most of the interior shots of Carey with new footage. Carey, now in a new and more furnished apartment, does not go out into the rain but instead stays in her living room. She walks over to a large pair of windows aside a mural of large throw pillows and candles, singing and <b>flailing</b> her arms as she completes the song. As with the previous filming of the video, Carey's pain and sadness is resolved with a rainbow, shown {{at the end of the}} video.|$|E
5|$|With the {{departure}} of Smith and Brinker, Pillsbury allowed many of their changes to be relaxed, as well as scaled back on construction of new locations which {{had the effect of}} stalling corporate growth. By failing to follow through on the changes of the two men, Pillsbury caused its own value to diminish as it derived more than one third of its sales and two thirds of its profits from the burger chain. When the British alcoholic beverages company Grand Metropolitan PLC made a hostile bid for Pillsbury, the company devised a plan to spin off the financially <b>flailing</b> restaurant unit in hopes to raise an estimated US$2billion {{that could be used to}} fend off the unwanted suitor. The complex potentially tax-free stock split plan would have led to the chain, along with its distribution system Distron, becoming a separate entity for the first time in over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of extra time began with yet another chance for Manchester United, this time {{constructed}} from a Giggs break down the left wing, but Van Nistelrooy failed {{in his attempt to}} back-heel Giggs' cross into the goal and the opportunity was wasted. Five minutes into the second half, Reyes committed another late tackle on Silvestre, for which he received a final warning from referee Styles. Reyes himself was then the victim of a late tackle by Scholes, who was shown a yellow card. The match threatened to descend into a mass brawl soon after, when Fortune caught Ljungberg in the face with a <b>flailing</b> arm and then committed a high tackle on Edu, provoking a reaction from the Arsenal players. A shoulder-charge by Rooney on Cole resulted in an Arsenal free kick on the left wing; Van Persie swung the ball over and it was only cleared as far as Ljungberg, but the Swede struck a shot with his shin and the ball spun wide. With a couple of minutes left in the extra period, Manchester United won a free kick on the left corner of the Arsenal penalty area when Vieira lazily tripped Ronaldo and received a booking, but Giggs' cross from the free kick was headed away. Meanwhile, Manchester United's substitute goalkeeper, Howard, was seen warming up behind the goal, suggesting that he was preparing to come on for Carroll {{in the event of a}} penalty shootout; however, no substitution was made.|$|E

25|$|On 2 June 2007, Sakuraba rematched Royce Gracie in K-1 Dynamite!! USA. While Sakuraba knocked Gracie to {{the canvas}} in the opening seconds, the bout itself was fought at a {{relatively}} slow pace, with Kazushi scoring multiple takedowns and Gracie scoring a number of <b>flailing</b> kicks to the legs and face from the bottom, as well as standing knee strikes to Kazushi's injured and bandaged knee. The Japanese wrestler also besieged Gracie on the ground, finishing the bout having taken the back of Gracie and searching for an armbar.

25|$|On October 16, 1719, {{the royal}} vessel San Carlos docked in San Juan. The boat needed repairs and {{requested}} Enríquez's help, who {{determined that the}} damage had been caused due to excessive cargo. He responded by donating La Trinidad de Burdeos for free. This move disarmed Pozo's posture, but the functionary replaced them with new bold claims, even claiming that the frigate was damaged. All of the treasurer's complaints were dismissed and the ship left port. That same year a conglomerate of his enemies {{sent a letter to}} the king, completely composed by critics and false accusations. However, within a year Phillip V wrote a personal letter thanking Enríquez for his service. His fleet had become the de facto guardian of the Caribbean, surpassing the efficiency of the Armada de Barlovento. With growing contempt against him, Enríquez secured the well-being of his son by placing three houses in San Juan and a farm near Bayamón river (worth 20,000 pieces of eight) to the service of the church. This move guaranteed that they would be beyond the reach of his enemies, with the intention that Vicente would end serving as the chaplain of these properties, receiving a stable income and inheriting at least part of his fortune. To this end, he made a request to Valdivia so that Vicente could fulfill this role. Despite this office, he would also aid his father manage his business. Enríquez had also led an effort to rebuild the cathedral of San Juan. Despite being a mulatto, Enríquez owned several African slaves, which served as an assertion of his social status and performed his menual tasks. At least 50 were working in one of his haciendas, El Plantaje. Enríquez owned another hacienda, Ribiera del Bayamón, where he employed 49 black slaves. Of which he might have fathered a significant portion of 21, which shared his last name, with most also being named Miguel. The other option being that the parents of these children decided to adopt his name as a form of tribute for their master. He maintained this group with three plantations that amassed over 7,982 plants and 10,000 yards where yuca was cultivated. His haciendas were mostly dedicated to the support of his slaves, who in turn did most of the hard work that sustained his empire. Enríquez employed more in his workshops and the port, performing works that varied from carpenters and blacksmiths to moving cargo and supply ships that were about to set sail. Enríquez rarely bought these slaves and the few times that he did it was through the advantages provided by the Royal Asiento or the Guinea Company. Most of them were actually acquired through his privateering vessels. Between 1716 and 1733, his ships captured over 176 slaves in this manner. The most successful was La Modista, which captured 79 from a British slaver and 16 from a Danish ship. Enríquez was the Puerto Rican that owned more slaves during his time and was reportedly harsh with them. His methods of discipline included holding them captive in his own private jail, food depravation and <b>flailing.</b> Between 1718 and 1720, several storms affected Puerto Rico, destroying the agriculture and causing a shortage of food and shelter. To further complicate matters, an epidemic was declared, causing the death of several patients. The residents of San Juan asked Enríquez to help, and he responded by donating 400 jars of melado (a type of food made from sugar and molasses) and an entire shipment of corn, which one of his ships had delivered. He also took over the funeral services of the poor that died, paying the Church personally.|$|E

40|$|Background: There {{has been}} scant {{academic}} consideration paid to investigations of mitral leaflet <b>flail</b> {{in terms of}} clinical profile, surgical strategy, and surgical outcome. Methods: One hundred consecutive patients with mitral leaflet <b>flail</b> referred for surgical treatment in the past 42 / 3 years were included in this study. Results: The most common reasons leading to mitral leaflet <b>flail</b> were chord rupture (38 %), myxomatous degeneration (23 %), and combined chord rupture and myxomatous degeneration (12 %). Mitral leaflet <b>flail</b> was predominantly characterized by independent P 2 <b>flail,</b> followed by P 2, 3 <b>flail</b> and independent A 2 <b>flail.</b> Chord rupture occurred in 54 patients, and the most commonly involved segments were P 2, P 2, 3, and P 3. The most common risk factors for mitral valve replacement were papillary muscle rupture, extensive myxomatous degeneration, exten-sive chord rupture, and severely dilated mitral valve annulus. Multivariate regression analy-ses demonstrated {{that the development of}} mitral leaflet <b>flail</b> was significantly associated with the pertinent variables tested, especially correlated with insertion of the prosthetic ring, number of artificial chord, and presence of carotid stenosis...|$|R

5000|$|Asymmetric {{prolapse}} {{is further}} subdivided into <b>flail</b> and non-flail. <b>Flail</b> prolapse {{occurs when a}} leaflet tip turns outward, becoming concave toward the left atrium, causing {{the deterioration of the}} mitral valve. The severity of <b>flail</b> leaflet varies, ranging from tip eversion to chordal rupture. Dissociation of leaflet and chordae tendineae provides for unrestricted motion of the leaflet (hence [...] "flail leaflet"). Thus patients with <b>flail</b> leaflets have a higher prevalence of mitral regurgitation than those with the non-flail subtype.|$|R
40|$|<b>Flail</b> {{chest is}} a rare {{complication}} in pediatric patients with blunt chest trauma. There is no general consensus on which treatment is most appropriate for <b>flail</b> chest in pediatric patients, {{although it has been}} reported that surgical fixation is associated with beneficial outcomes for <b>flail</b> chest in adults. The present report described two pediatric cases of <b>flail</b> chest, which was rare in pediatric blunt trauma. In small children, functional residual capacity is smaller, and the thorax is pliable due to high thoracic compliance. Therefore, it is only advisable to select intubation and mechanical ventilation treatment. Likewise, in pediatric <b>flail</b> chest, the available evidence does not suggest that ventilator management protocols should be adopted routinely, and the treatment for pediatric <b>flail</b> chest was not established completely. There were not huge different between the described patients, including injury severity and ventilation setting. However, one had a relapse of <b>flail</b> chest after extubation and chest taping was required, while the other patient’s condition was stable after decannulation. As described above, it is difficult to predict a recurrence of <b>flail</b> chest in pediatric patients even if treatment goes well.
