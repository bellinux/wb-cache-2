40|$|The Ceratitis capitata {{is a very}} {{important}} agricultural pest, whose reproduction behaviour is controled by chemical signals. Males initiate mating by creating leks, where they release sexual pheromones to attract females. The main goal of this diploma thesis was to determine the influence of host plants on the composition of male sex-pheromones C. capitata and to compare emanations of wild males with those originating from laboratory population. We studied the chemical composition of volatiles, released by calling males C. capitata from laboratory and two wild populations, using two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometric detection (GC×GC-TOFMS), gas chromatography with electroantennographic and flame ionization detection (GC-EAD-FID). All data were statistically analyzed by multivariate data analyses. Significant differences were observed in the quantitative and qualitative composition of the chemical emanations among males from the three populations. The GC-EAD-FID analyses revealed fourteen antenally active compounds with a possible behavioral function.

40|$|In moths, the {{components}} of the female pheromone blend are detected in the male antennae by pheromone olfactory receptor neurons (Ph-ORNs) expressing narrowly tuned olfactory receptors. Responses to sex pheromones have generally been thought to be independent from the odorant background. However, interactions between pheromone components and plant volatiles have been reported at behavioral and detection levels. To document the mechanisms of such interactions, we analyzed Ph-ORN responses of Spodoptera littoralis to the main pheromone component, Z 9 E 11 - 14 :Ac, in the presence of 4 monoterpenes. To mimic natural contexts in which plant odors and pheromone emanate from different sources, the 2 stimuli were presented with different temporal patterns and from independent sources. Linalool reversibly reduced the firing response to Z 9 E 11 - 14 :Ac and produced an off effect. Geraniol and <b>geranyl</b> and linalyl <b>acetates</b> reduced the responses to Z 9 E 11 - 14 :Ac with a longer time course. Pulses of linalool over prolonged pheromone stimulation resulted in a discontinuous firing activity. Pulses of pheromone were better separated over a background of linalool, compared with odorless air. The data confirm that plant compounds may modulate the intensity and the temporal coding by Ph-ORNs of pheromone information. This modulation might positively affect mate location at high pheromone density especially nearby a pheromone source.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to study the production and the mass transfer of <b>geranyl</b> <b>acetate</b> known for its interesting green odor properties. Lipase-catalyzed <b>geranyl</b> <b>acetate</b> production via transesterification reaction with ethyl acetate in organic solvent was investigated. The production was catalyzed by using immobilized lipase from Rhizomucor miehei, and the recovery was achieved by using solid phase microextraction (SPME) fiber system (50 / 30 μm DVB/Carboxen/PDMS Coating). The effects of different reaction parameters on transesterification including the enzyme concentration, the substrate molar ratio, the added water, and the reaction time were firstly optimized. A higher yield of 82 % was achieved under near-anhydrous conditions at 55 °C by using an enzyme concentration of 6 % (w/w reactants), a molar ratio of geraniol to ethyl acetate of 1 : 5, and a reaction time of 6 h.

40|$|Background: Geraniol is an acyclic {{monoterpene}} alcohol, which exhibits good prospect as {{a gasoline}} alternative. Geraniol is naturally encountered in plants at low concentrations and an attractive target for microbial engineering. Geraniol has been heterologously produced in Escherichia coli, but the low titer hinders its industrial applications. Moreover, bioconversion of geraniol by E. coli remains largely unknown. Results: Recombinant overexpression of Ocimum basilicum geraniol synthase, Abies grandis geranyl diphosphate synthase, and a heterotic mevalonate pathway in E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) enabled {{the production of}} up to 68. 6 ± 3 mg/L geraniol in shake flasks. Initial fed-batch fermentation only increased geraniol production to 78. 8 mg/L. To further improve the production yield, the fermentation conditions were optimized. Firstly, 81. 4 % of volatile geraniol was lost during the first 5 h of fermentation in a solvent-free system. Hence, isopropyl myristate {{was added to the}} culture medium to form an aqueous-organic two-phase culture system, which effectively prevented volatilization of geraniol. Secondly, most of geraniol was eventually biotransformed into <b>geranyl</b> <b>acetate</b> by E. coli, thus decreasing geraniol production. For the first time, we revealed the role of acetylesterase (Aes, EC 3. 1. 1. 6) from E. coli in hydrolyzing <b>geranyl</b> <b>acetate</b> to geraniol, and production of geraniol was successfully increased to 2. 0 g/L under controlled fermentation conditions.
