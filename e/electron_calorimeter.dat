40|$|We present 1 D cosmic ray {{transport}} models, numerically solving equations of pure advection and diffusion for {{the electrons}} and calculating synchrotron emission spectra. We find that for exponential halo magnetic field distributions advection leads to approximately exponential radio continuum intensity profiles, whereas diffusion leads to profiles {{that can be}} better approximated by a Gaussian function. Accordingly, the vertical radio spectral profiles for advection are approximately linear, whereas for diffusion they are of `parabolic' shape. We compare our models with deep ATCA observations of two edge-on galaxies, NGC 7090 and 7462, at λλ 22 and 6 cm. Our {{result is that the}} cosmic ray transport in NGC 7090 is advection dominated with V= 150 ^+ 80 _- 30 km s^- 1, and that the one in NGC 7462 is diffusion dominated with D= 3. 0 ± 1. 0 × 10 ^ 28 E_ GeV^ 0. 5 cm^ 2 s^- 1. NGC 7090 has both a thin and thick radio disc with respective magnetic field scale heights of h_ B 1 = 0. 8 ± 0. 1 kpc and h_ B 2 = 4. 7 ± 1. 0 kpc. NGC 7462 has only a thick radio disc with h_ B 2 = 3. 8 ± 1. 0 kpc. In both galaxies, the magnetic field scale heights are significantly smaller than what estimates from energy equipartition would suggest.

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a family of}} models {{for the evolution of}} energetic particles in the starburst galaxy M 82 and compare them to observations to test the calorimeter assumption that all cosmic ray energy is radiated in the starburst region. Assuming constant cosmic ray acceleration efficiency with Milky Way parameters, we calculate the cosmic-ray proton and primary and secondary electron/positron populations as a function of energy. Cosmic rays are injected with Galactic energy distributions and electron-to-proton ratio via type II supernovae at the observed rate of 0. 07 /yr. From the cosmic ray spectra, we predict the radio synchrotron and γ-ray spectra. To more accurately model the radio spectrum, we incorporate a multiphase interstellar medium in the starburst region of M 82. Our model interstellar medium is highly fragmented with compact dense molecular clouds and dense photoionized gas, both embedded in a hot, low density medium in overall pressure equilibrium. The spectra predicted by this one-zone model are compared to the observed radio and γ-ray spectra of M 82. Chi-squared tests are used with radio and γ-ray observations and a range of model predictions to find the best-fit parameters. The best-fit model yields constraints on key parameters in the starburst zone of M 82, including a magnetic field strength of 250 μ G and a wind advection speed in the range of 300 - 700 km/s. We find that M 82 is a good <b>electron</b> <b>calorimeter</b> but not an ideal cosmic-ray proton calorimeter and discuss the implications of our results for the astrophysics of the far infrared-radio correlation in starburst galaxies.

40|$|How {{a galaxy}} regulates its SNe energy into {{different}} interstellar/circumgalactic medium components strongly affects galaxy evolution. Based on the JVLA D-configuration C- (6 GHz) and L-band (1. 6 GHz) continuum observations, we perform statistical analysis comparing multi-wavelength {{properties of the}} CHANG-ES galaxies. The high-quality JVLA data and edge-on orientation enable us {{for the first time}} to include the halo into the energy budget for a complete radio-flux-limited sample. We find tight correlations of L_ radio with the mid-IR-based SFR. The normalization of our I_ 1. 6 GHz/ W Hz^- 1 - SFR relation is ∼ 2 - 3 times of those obtained for face-on galaxies, probably a result of enhanced IR extinction at high inclination. We also find tight correlations between L_ radio and the SNe energy injection rate Ė_ SN(Ia+CC), indicating the energy loss via synchrotron radio continuum accounts for ∼ 0. 1 % of Ė_ SN, comparable to the energy contained in CR electrons. The integrated C-to-L-band spectral index is α∼ 0. 5 - 1. 1 for non-AGN galaxies, indicating a dominance by the diffuse synchrotron component. The low-scatter L_ radio- SFR/L_ radio-Ė_ SN (Ia+CC) relationships have super-linear logarithmic slopes at ∼ 2 σ in L-band (1. 132 ± 0. 067 / 1. 175 ± 0. 102) while consistent with linear in C-band (1. 057 ± 0. 075 / 1. 100 ± 0. 123). The super-linearity could be naturally reproduced with non-calorimeter models for galaxy disks. Using Chandra halo X-ray measurements, we find sub-linear L_ X-L_ radio relations.

40|$|The current primary {{standards}} at NPL for {{the measurement of}} absorbed dose to water in high energy photon and electron beams are graphite calorimeters.

Therefore, a new absorbed dose to water standard based on water calorimetry has been developed for use in high energy photon and <b>electron</b> beams. The <b>calorimeter</b> operates at 4 deg C, with temperature control being provided by liquid cooling. The sealed glass inner vessel of the calorimeter was designed to minimise the effect of non-water materials on the measurement of absorbed dose.

40|$|International audienceAn {{aggressive}} low-mass and high-stress {{design of}} a very large detector magnet assembly for the Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh), consisting of a “twin solenoid” and two dipoles, is presented. The twin solenoid features two concentric solenoids. The inner solenoid provides 6 T over a free bore of 12 m and a length of 20 m, enclosing the inner particle trackers and <b>electron</b> and hadron <b>calorimeters.</b> The outer solenoid reduces the stray field of the inner solenoid and provides additional bending power for high-quality muon tracking. Dipoles are included, providing 10 T · m of bending power in a 6 -m mean free bore covering the forward directions for η ≥ 2. 5 particles. The overall length of this magnet assembly is 43 m. The presence of several separate magnets in the system presents a challenge in terms of forces and torques acting between them. A rigid support structure, part of the cold mass, holds the inner and outer solenoids of the twin solenoid in place. The dipoles are equipped with lateral coils so that the net force and torque are reduced to zero. The second challenge is the substantial conductor and support structure mass used for containing the magnetic pressure. A doped aluminum stabilized and reinforced conductor is proposed, allowing minimal overall mass of the system. The result is a system consisting of a 53 -GJ twin solenoid and two 1. 5 -GJ dipoles. The cold mass and the vacuum vessel mass of the twin solenoid are 3. 2 and 2. 4 kt, respectively; and the dipole cold mass weighs 0. 38 kt.

40|$|Purpose: In this work, {{the authors}} {{describe}} an <b>electron</b> sealed water <b>calorimeter</b> (ESWcal) designed to directly measure absorbed dose to water in clinical electron beams {{and its use}} to derive electron beam quality conversion factors for two ionization chamber types. Methods: A functioning calorimeter prototype was constructed in-house and used to obtain reproducible measurements in clinical accelerator-based 6, 9, 12, 16, and 20 MeV electron beams. Corrections for the radiation field perturbation due {{to the presence of}} the glass calorimeter vessel were calculated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The conductive heat transfer due to dose gradients and nonwater materials was also accounted for using a commercial finite element method software package. Results: The relative combined standard uncertainty on the ESWcal dose was estimated to be 0. 50 % for the 9 - 20 MeV beams and 1. 00 % for the 6 MeV beam, demonstrating that the development of a water calorimeter-based standard for electron beams over such a wide range of clinically relevant energies is feasible. The largest contributor to the uncertainty was the positioning (Type A, 0. 10 %- 0. 40 %) and its influence on the perturbation correction (Type B, 0. 10 %- 0. 60 %). As a preliminary validation, measurements performed with the ESWcal in a 6 MV photon beam were directly compared to results derived from the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) photon beam standard water calorimeter. These two independent devices were shown to agree well within the 0. 43 % combined relative uncertainty of the ESWcal for this beam type and quality. Absorbed dose electron beam quality conversion factors were measured using the ESWcal for the Exradin A 12 and PTW Roos ionization chambers. The photon-electron conversion factor, kecal, for the A 12 was also experimentally determined. Nonstatistically significant differences of up to 0. 7 % were found when compared to the calculation-based factors listed in the AAPM's TG- 51 protocol. General agreement between the relative electron energy dependence of the PTW Roos data measured in this work and a recent MC-based study are also shown.

40|$|The Large Hadron Collider, {{starting}} in 2008, {{will be a}} "top factory" as top-antitop pairs will be produced with {{a cross section of}} about 830 pb at an instantaneous luminosity of 10 ^ 33 cm^- 2 s^- 1 during the first year. With about 30 % probability top pairs decay semileptonically into a final state with four jets, lepton (electron or muon) and respective neutrino. For another 5 % of the top pair events a dileptonic decay is expected. Here the final state signature is composed of two jets, two leptons and two neutrinos. In this thesis the precision for a top pair cross section measurement at the ATLAS experiment in the semileptonic and dileptonic channels with cut based analyses, applicable to the first data, was estimated. The analysis of the semileptonic decay focused especially on the study of background from QCD events either with leptons from semileptonic hadron decays or from hadrons falsely identified as <b>electrons</b> by the <b>calorimeter.</b> For the first 10 fb^- 1 and assuming a fake electron probability of 10 ^- 3 a precision for the cross section times the branching ratio of +- 0. 5 (stat) +- 30. 4 (syst) +- 24. 0 (lumi) pb has been estimated, corresponding to a relative precision of 16 % for the theoretically predicted cross section times branching ratio of about 240 pb. The analysis in the dileptonic channel achieves a precision of +- 0. 2 (stat) +- 2. 5 (syst) +- 2. 6 (lumi) pb which translates into a relative error of 10 % for the cross section times branching ratio of around 38 pb. The errors for both the semileptonic and the dileptonic channel are expected to improve as progress is made on the luminosity determination and the knowledge of the backgrounds from comparisons with measured data. A measurement of the cross-section ratio between the dileptonic and semileptonic channel is sensitive to scenarios of new phenomena with competitive top quark decay modes such as decays involving a charged Higgs boson. It has been estimated that such a ratio should be measurable with a relative precision of +- 0. 7 %(stat) +- 7. 7 %(sys) +- 3. 1 %(lumi) {{during the first year of}} ATLAS data-taking. Even though the systematic errors partially cancel in such a ratio the total uncertainty is still around 8 % as the background estimates rely on theoretical predictions.

40|$|Gamma {{radiation}} {{represents the}} most energetic {{part of the}} electromagnetic spectrum: therefore, it provides information about the most energetic processes and phenomena in the Universe. High energy γ rays can be produced through acceleration of charged particles by galactic astrophysical objects like Supernova Remnants or Pulsars, or by extragalactic sources (Active Galactic Nuclei and Blazars). Because photons are neutral particles, they are not deflected by galactic magnetic fields and their incoming direction points back directly to the source. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS- 02), a general purpose experimental apparatus installed in the International Space Station on May 16 th 2011, has the capability to detect high energy γ rays because of its electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), which is able to trigger and identify γ rays. ECAL has an excellent energy resolution (about 1. 4 % at 1 TeV). At present no other γ ray detector operating in Space has a better energy resolution for γ rays in the TeV region. Furthermore, from test beam studies, ECAL {{is expected to have}} a good angular resolution, a crucial feature to associate γ rays to known sources. In this thesis, the angular resolution of ECAL for high energy γ rays is studied from flight data. Assuming the angular resolution is the same for electrons and photons (both develop similar electromagnetic showers in the <b>calorimeter),</b> <b>electrons</b> have been used because they can be traced by means of the AMS- 02 silicon tracker. In fact, the electron direction was obtained by applying three different algorithms to the electromagnetic shower shape in ECAL, then compared with the direction reconstructed by the silicon tracker. The best agreement was found using an algorithm that provides an angular resolution of about 0. 5 degrees at 1 TeV. Thus, this algorithm was chosen to analyze γ rays. In the analysis, photons were identified using a Boost Decision Tree, which enhanced the separation between photons and background. The angular error associated to each γ is transferred into galactic coordinates to obtain its Point Spread Function (PSF), which depends on the energy and on the impact angle of the photon. A catalog of γ sources above 10 GeV has been published in summer 2013 by the Fermi collaboration: only a fraction of these sources can be detected by AMS- 02, owing to the AMS- 02 acceptance (geometric acceptance plus efficiency) and to its exposure time. Sources expected to be detectable by ECAL were taken into account in this thesis. Given the PSF, the distance for each selected γ from the nearest source was used to associate γ rays detected by ECAL to Fermi sources. To estimate the amount of fake associations due to diffused photons, a Monte Carlo simulation was developed to generate random events distributed according to the expected diffused photon flux. This thesis shows that, thanks to the extraordinary capability of ECAL to reconstruct the incoming direction, AMS- 02 can identify sources, among the known ones, emitting γ rays from 50 GeV to TeV energies. Furthermore, it is also shown that future larger statistics will allow to identify new γ sources with high flux at high energy...|$|R
