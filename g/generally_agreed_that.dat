5|$|According to Nielsen ratings, {{the episode}} drew just over 24million viewers, {{indicating}} a 4million viewer decrease {{from the previous}} season premiere a year earlier. The episode received mostly positive reviews. Critics complimented the six-month time jump and <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the episode showed improvement over {{the quality of the}} second season.|$|E
5|$|All {{witnesses}} <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> {{the first}} two shots were almost indistinguishable from each other. General firing immediately broke out. Virgil and Wyatt thought Tom was armed. When shooting started, the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw {{his hand to his}} right hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse's movement, hiding behind it, and fired once or twice over the horse's back.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} remaster was mostly positive. Several critics {{noted that some}} features like the inventory system and the insistence on having to revisit previously explored areas have not aged very well, but <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the remaster was a solid revival of a classic. The new control scheme was also considered more intuitive and satisfying, especially for new players.|$|E

5|$|It is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the Chelicerata {{contain the}} classes Arachnida (spiders, scorpions, mites, etc.), Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs) and Eurypterida (sea scorpions, extinct). The extinct Chasmataspida {{may be a}} {{sub-group}} within Eurypterida. The Pycnogonida (sea spiders) were traditionally classified as chelicerates, but some features suggest they may be representatives of the earliest arthropods from which the well-known groups such as chelicerates evolved.|$|E
5|$|Long-term field {{research}} has shown that range size, group size, social systems, and territorial behavior vary widely, and may be greatly affected by food distribution and quality. It is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the ruffed lemur social system is multi-male/multi-female with a fission-fusion society, although some populations of black-and-white ruffed lemur have been reported as monogamous. This social flexibility is suspected to improve survivability despite an inflexible feeding ecology.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{introductions of}} A. altissima to countries outside of its native range {{were to the}} southern areas of Korea {{as well as to}} Japan. It is possible that the tree is native to these areas, but it is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the tree was a very early introduction. Within China itself it has also been naturalised beyond its native range in areas such as Qinghai, Ningxia and Xinjiang.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} first {{revealed}} by Atari at the Games Convention 2008. The game was poorly received after its release; video game critics gave it an aggregated score of 49% at Metacritic. Reviewers <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> presenting a cooking guide as {{a video game}} was a good idea, but {{they found that the}} game was poorly executed and mediocre as a result.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian {{statistics}} of 1889, there were 57.8% Lithuanians, 19.1% Poles, and 3.5% Belarusians in the Suwałki Governorate. It is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> Lithuanians formed the majority {{population in the}} northern Suwałki Governorate, while Poles were concentrated in south. But, Lithuanian and Polish historians and political scientists continued to disagree over {{the location of the}} line that separated the Lithuanian from the Polish majorities. Lithuanians claimed that Sejny and the surrounding area were inhabited primarily by Lithuanians, while the Poles claimed exactly the opposite. The German census of 1916 showed that 51% of Sejny population was Lithuanian.|$|E
5|$|After {{settling}} at Glen Noe, {{the chiefs}} {{are said to}} have held the land for centuries. While presumably owning the property outright originally, it is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> at some, uncertain date, they acquired a feudal obligation to the Campbells of Breadalbane. Initially, this entailed only a symbolic payment. Tradition identifies this as a snowball supplied at midsummer and a white calf surrendered but then killed and shared by landlord and tenant as a token of mutual esteem.|$|E

5|$|Although it is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the aye-aye is {{the most}} basal member of the lemur clade, the {{relationship}} between the other four families is less clear since they diverged during a narrow 10 to 12million-year window between the Late Eocene (42mya) and into the Oligocene (30mya). Although all studies place Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae as a sister clade to Indriidae and Lemuridae, some suggest that Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae diverged first, while others suggest that Indriidae and Lemuridae were the first to branch off.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, P.semilanceata has a {{widespread}} distribution, and {{is found in}} Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Channel Islands, Czech republic, Denmark, Estonia, the Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the species is native to Europe; Watling has demonstrated that there exists little difference between specimens collected from Spain and Scotland, at both the morphological and genetic level.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{pushed for}} greater {{consultation}} and {{voice for the}} dominions, and succeeded in having Richard Casey appointed as a permanent political liaison in London who would have access to British government decisions and act as a conduit between Westminster and Melbourne. He also successfully lobbied {{for the creation of}} a Dominion Office separated out from the Colonial Office to acknowledge the different state of affairs that now existed in the Empire. However, while fellow dominions <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the imperial system should be modified, not all shared his vision for closer collaboration and strong ties. Canada and the Union of South Africa were instead seeking greater independence from London, and there was little enthusiasm for many of Bruce's more ambitious plans for inter-empire trade and policy cooperation.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{exploited}} the accident {{to undermine the}} IK-1 concept, with Bajdak joining those criticising the aircraft. The three flights were not considered sufficient to give a verdict on the design, and the debate over its future was fierce. This placed significant pressure on the designers, as every element of the aircraft design was subsequently attacked. Eventually, it was <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the aircraft was well-designed, but it needed more testing. At this point, Ikarus decided to build a second prototype, as {{it was evident that}} the hand-sewn fabric seam on the wing had not stood up to the strain of aerobatics, and their workmanship was in question. The second prototype took 10 months to build, with the two designers closely involved.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> {{the plants}} {{depicted}} in the stele fragment are either poppies or pomegranate flowers, however, classical archaeologists and historians of ancient Greek art discuss different species in the literature: German scholar Ernst Langlotz (1895–1978) thought that the women were holding a type of rose; Picard recognizes the symbolism of Demeter and Kore and identifies the flowers as a species of poppy, possibly the opium poppy, the Oriental poppy, or the Iranian poppy. Careful examination of the thick 'stems' fails to resemble that of the flowers. German scholar Eugen Petersen (1837–1919) proposed that the figures were holding knucklebones (talus bones from goats or sheep used {{to play the game}} of jacks) in their left hand and roses in the right hand; Hampe argues that the stele depicts only knucklebones, not flowers.|$|E
5|$|The PS4 {{version of}} Leifthrasir {{received}} an aggregate score of 87/100 based on 49 reviews, becoming the 15th best-reviewed title of 2016. The Vita version received {{a score of}} 93/100 based on five reviews. Reviewing Leifthrasir, Famitsu praised the increased smoothness and battle frequency, noting that the title still felt fresh despite being the remake of a 2007 title. They also praised the graphical upgrade {{and its effect on}} the artwork. Critics <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> Leifthrasir was an improvement on the original game, praising its technical performance, lack of the original's framerate problems, graphical upgrade, and redesigned gameplay systems. Despite this, reviewers noted that the game could get repetitive, with a few noting incumbent issues with its story presentation.|$|E

5|$|The county {{magistrate}} and commandery administrator {{were the}} official court judges {{of the county}} and commandery, respectively. Their jurisdictions overlapped, yet the commandery administrator only interfered in county court cases when necessary; it was <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> whoever arrested a criminal first {{would be the first}} to judge him or her. If a commandery-level court case could not be resolved, the central government's Commandant of Justice was the final authority of appeal before the emperor. Yet he most often dealt with cases of political rebels and regicide in regards to kings, marquesses, and high officials. Above the Commandant was the emperor, the supreme judge and lawgiver.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary {{with the beginning of}} the Bronze Age in the late 4th millennium BC. The Sumerian archaic cuneiform script and the Egyptian hieroglyphs are generally considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts from about 2600 BC. It is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of cultural diffusion. A similar debate exists for the Chinese script, which developed around 1200 BC. The pre-Columbian Mesoamerican writing systems (including among others Olmec and Maya scripts) are generally believed to have had independent origins.|$|E
5|$|The pre-Columbian Maya civilization {{developed}} and used an intricate and fully functional writing system, {{which is the}} only Mesoamerican script that can be said to be almost fully deciphered. Earlier-established civilizations to the west and north of the Maya homelands that also had scripts recorded in surviving inscriptions include the Zapotec, Olmec, and the Zoque-speaking peoples of the southern Veracruz and western Chiapas area—but their scripts are as yet largely undeciphered. It is <b>generally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the Maya writing system was adapted from {{one or more of these}} earlier systems. A number of references identify the undeciphered Olmec script as its most likely precursor.|$|E
50|$|The DSM-IV, and psychologists, <b>generally</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> {{personal}} beliefs {{should be evaluated}} with great respect to cultural and religious differences, since some cultures have widely accepted beliefs that may be considered delusional in other cultures.|$|R
