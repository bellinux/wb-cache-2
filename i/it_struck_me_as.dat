2500|$|Dani first {{appeared}} in the 1999 song [...] "Californication", which includes the lyrics [...] "Teenage bride with a baby inside/Gettin' high on information" [...] although the girl's name is not specified. She was next mentioned in the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 2002 single [...] "By the Way" [...] as [...] "Dani the girl". Kiedis commented: [...] "When this funky groove came up <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a perfect place to actually tell a story. It sort of revealed itself to me that it's been the same character, just kind of developing. At first I didn't realize that I was writing about the same girl." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1906 Iowa {{game was}} {{refereed}} {{by one of}} the top football officials in the country, West Point's Lt. Horatio B. [...] "Stuffy" [...] Hackett, who {{became a member of the}} American Intercollegiate Football Rules Committee in December 1907. Hackett later told a reporter, [...] "It was the most perfect exhibition... of the new rules ... that I have seen all season and much better than that of Yale and Harvard. [...] St. Louis' style of pass differs entirely from that in use in the east. ... The St. Louis university players shoot the ball hard and accurately to the man who is to receive it ... The fast throw by St. Louis enables the receiving player to dodge the opposing players, and <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> being all but perfect." ...|$|E
60|$|Thinking {{over the}} interview, <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> being profoundly unsatisfactory.|$|E
6000|$|I saw in {{fact that}} he had, and <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> really <b>as</b> wonderful. But I {{controlled}} the expression of my wonder. [...] "So that if you spoke therefore just now of watching them----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I confess, my dear Watson, {{that that}} does not appeal to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a very {{probable}} explanation. <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me,</b> however, <b>as</b> being the one which was most likely to interest that exceedingly unpleasant old person." ...|$|R
5000|$|He wrote further:"The fact is, I was {{at times}} {{appalled by the}} book, annoyed by it, angered by <b>it.</b> <b>Its</b> ending <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> cynical and manipulative. But even so, I found myself rapt from {{beginning}} to end, fascinated by Homes's single-minded talent for provocation." ...|$|R
60|$|HASLAM. Did {{you notice}} one thing? <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> rather curious.|$|E
60|$|FANNY [she {{looks at}} her dress]. Yes, <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> being about that period.|$|E
60|$|I {{thought about}} the crime, and <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> being very unreal and far off.|$|E
6000|$|... "I remember," [...] said my father, [...] "the first masked ball I {{ever went}} to when I {{was a student}} in Paris. <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> just <b>as</b> you say, Hal; {{everybody}} was so exactly alike. I was glad to get {{out into the street}} and see faces." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{they drank}} the King and Fox-hunting. I drank the King because there's {{something}} about Edward that tickles me (he's so blame British); but I rather stood {{out on the}} Fox-hunting. I've ridden wolves in the cattle- country, and needed a drink pretty bad afterwards, but <b>it</b> never <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> I ought to drink about it--he-red-it-arily.|$|R
60|$|As he spoke, {{the arrival}} of the {{carpenter}} was announced. We all went up-stairs, at once, to the top story. I noticed that the Sergeant was unusually grave, even for him. <b>It</b> also <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> odd that he told the boy (after having previously encouraged him to follow us), to wait in the room below till we came down again.|$|R
6000|$|... "The whole affair, {{or rather}} the motive {{underneath}} <b>it,</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> so Scout-like that I thought I'd try to get acquainted," [...] continued Upton.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is if it's {{the same}} one." [...] <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> feeble {{to say nothing}} more; so I added [...] "My Mr. Porterfield was called David." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a {{singular}} implication that you couldn't {{be out of}} a counting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferred to his experience.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that, alone <b>as</b> I was, in {{the hands}} of men who were a species of outlaws, it might be well to clear myself from every {{imputation}} that, at least, was not merited.|$|R
60|$|I have no excuse, {{but that}} at that time both my body and my memory were run off their legs. I am very glad you thought the answer[90] {{appeared}} to you triumphant, for <b>it</b> had <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> in the main point, knowledge of the subject, and spirit in the writing, and accuracy in the logic, {{as one of the}} best controversial tracts I ever had.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{disposed}} to think," [...] said Mrs. Geoffrey Langford, thoughtfully, [...] "that {{it was the}} best thing for her to be thrown on herself. Too much talk has always been the mischief with her, as with many another only child, and <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> to-day <b>as</b> a very good sign that she said so little. There was something very touching in the complete absence of moralizing to-day." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> so unkind, {{his having}} gone off in that way, that I burst into tears; and Uncle John came out, {{and led me}} back into the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "No? After {{the fact}} you {{mentioned}} <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> rather apposite; but I {{may have been}} wrong. The point's hardly worth discussing, and I'm going on to the hotel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{took the}} water breaker off {{before you were}} up,” {{he said as he}} came alongside. “There was ice on the pool. <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a warning that we had better lose no time.” ...|$|E
60|$|Just then <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that <b>as</b> {{there were}} several posts of an old weir {{in the middle of}} the stream, he must have twisted the line round one of these, broken himself off and left me {{attached}} to it! I made up my mind therefore to wade out to the old weir, and unwind the line, and gave the rod to the boy to hold while I did so.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had no orders, general; but I was {{appointed}} to command the first company that entered, {{and was told that}} we were to turn right and left along the ramparts. <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that <b>as,</b> when we had left, the enemy would be sure to turn their guns upon us, it would be as well to silence them, so I brought the nails and a hammer with me for the purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} this fact commented on," [...] Eve answered, [...] "and even by foreigners, and I confess <b>it</b> has always <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> singular. Why should {{the agent of}} a {{republic}} make a parade of his anti-republican sentiments?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a {{sporting}} idea. In my enthusiasm I offered to accompany him, and wait outside the shop. I said I thought that Harris {{would like to}} be in it, too--or rather outside.|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{everybody}} knew what Blome wanted and had intended, {{this question of}} Steele's seemed strange on one hand. An' yet on the other, now that the Ranger stood there, <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> natural enough.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a very {{satisfactory}} {{thing to}} look upon this pleasant lady solely and simply as a human being. It is so seldom that we meet any one who can be looked upon in that light.|$|E
60|$|I made no sceptical remarks, and did {{not even}} shake my head. The {{circumstances}} of the encounter were described by Mariano with such graphic power and minuteness {{that it was impossible}} not to believe his story. Yet some things in <b>it</b> afterwards <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> somewhat absurd; that straw hat, for instance, and it also seemed strange that a person of Mula's disposition should have been so much improved in temper by his sojourn in a warmer place.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got one sure," [...] he said. [...] "Now, in {{a general}} way, if there's a store handy, I've no use for mending clothes; {{but you have to}} wash them now and then, and <b>it</b> never <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> quite {{comfortable}} to put them on with half the stitching rubbed out of them. Well, washing's a thing I'm not fond of either, and it's kind of curious that when one man starts in at it everybody wants the coal-oil can." ...|$|R
5000|$|Gary Krist in The New York Times {{described}} it as a [...] "nasty and willfully grotesque novel. The fact is, I was at times appalled by the book, annoyed by it, angered by <b>it.</b> <b>Its</b> ending <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> cynical and manipulative. But even so, I found myself rapt from beginning to end, fascinated by Homes's single-minded talent for provocation."He concluded with a caveat: [...] "In her last two novels, the desire to outrage is so conspicuous that it risks obscuring her powerful gifts as a novelist." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus saying, {{she took}} the jewelled flower out of her hair; and <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> the act of a queen, when worsted in a combat, discrowning herself, as if she found a sort of relief in abasing all her pride.|$|E
60|$|I {{confess that}} as Summerlee stated his view <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> {{altogether}} reasonable. Even Challenger {{was affected by}} the consideration that his enemies would never stand confuted if the confirmation of his statements should never reach those who had doubted them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry. I didn't {{think you}} would look upon it as an impertinence. I didn't mean to say {{anything}} offensive. <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a possible {{way out of the}} difficulty. You would, at all events, be happier than you are here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{the doctor}} chimed in, [...] "and in my younger days, when I {{necessarily}} {{had a good}} deal of charity practice, I used to find them at leisure when they were 'laid off.' <b>It</b> always <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> such a pretty euphemism. It seemed to minify the harm of the thing so. It seemed to take all the hunger and cold and sickness out of the fact. To be simply 'laid off' was so different from losing your work and having to face beggary or starvation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it {{has often}} been {{introduced}} in his! I declare, Sir Wycherly, <b>it</b> has <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> singular, that while you and I have so very frequently stated in the presence of this gentleman, that our families are in no way connected, he has never, in any manner, not even by a nod or a look of approbation, assented to what he must certainly know to be the case. But I suppose, like a true colonist, he was unwilling to give up his hold on the old stock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Fan, I am so {{glad that}} this has {{happened}} to you. So much more glad than if I had myself experienced some great good fortune. And your brother--oh, how nobly he has acted--how much you must love and admire him! I remember that evening so well when you met him; I thought then that I had never seen anyone with so charming a manner. And there was something so melodious and sympathetic in his voice; how strange that <b>it</b> never <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> being like yours, {{and that he was}} like you in his eyes, and so many things!" ...|$|R
