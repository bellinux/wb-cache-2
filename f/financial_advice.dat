25|$|The NBC Radio Network also pioneered {{personal}} advice call-in national {{talk radio}} with a satellite-distributed evening talk show, TalkNet; the program featured Bruce Williams (providing personal <b>financial</b> <b>advice),</b> Bernard Meltzer (personal and <b>financial</b> <b>advice)</b> and Sally Jessy Raphael (personal and romantic advice).

500|$|The UFA {{took office}} {{at a time}} of drought in the {{southern}} regions of the province. At Brownlee's instigation, the government appointed a three-person panel, led by Charles Alexander Magrath, to investigate the problem. [...] In 1922 the government passed the Drought Relief Act. [...] The Act, a Brownlee brainchild, created a Drought Relief Commissioner to whom farmers in affected areas could turn for financial counselling and asset administration. [...] It authorized the adjustment of farmers' debts to levels that were within the debtors' means, but still sufficiently acceptable to creditors that their willingness to make loans would not disappear altogether. [...] Brownlee hoped that this system would provide affected farmers with sound <b>financial</b> <b>advice</b> and facilitate the fair division of farmers' assets among competing creditors without forcing farmers to pay high legal fees. [...] In 1923 this was replaced by the Debt Adjustment Act, which strengthened the commissioner's powers and was intended to extend his jurisdiction over the entire province; due to opposition from lenders, the portions of the act dealing with other than drought-stricken areas were never proclaimed.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of Sticky Fingers, the Rolling Stones left England after {{receiving}} <b>financial</b> <b>advice</b> from their financial manager at the time, Prince Rupert Loewenstein, recommending that they go into tax exile {{before the start of}} the next financial year. They had learned that despite promises made that taxes were taken care of, they had not been paid for seven years and that they owed the UK government a relative fortune that could have meant the end of the band. They moved to the South of France, where Richards rented the Villa Nellcôte and sublet rooms to band members and entourage. Using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, they held recording sessions in the basement; they completed the resulting tracks, along with material dating as far back as 1969, at Sunset Studios in Los Angeles. The resulting double album, Exile on Main St. (UK No. 1; US No. 1), was released in May 1972. Given an A+ grade by critic Robert Christgau and disparaged by Lester Bangs – who reversed his opinion within months – Exile is now accepted as one of the Stones' best albums. The films Cocksucker Blues (never officially released) and [...] (released in 1974) document the subsequent highly publicised 1972 North American Tour.|$|E
500|$|After he was {{discharged}} from his military service, Dudley returned to Northamptonshire. [...] He then entered {{the service of}} Sir Augustine Nicolls, a relative of his mother's, as a clerk. [...] Nicolls, a lawyer and later a judge, was recognized for his honesty {{at a time when}} many judges were susceptible to bribery and other malfeasance. [...] He was also sympathetic to the Puritan cause; the exposure to legal affairs and Nicolls' religious views probably had a significant influence on Dudley. [...] After Nicolls' sudden death in 1616, Dudley took a position with Theophilus Clinton, 4th Earl of Lincoln, serving as a steward responsible for managing some of the earl's estates. Although there is a likely blood connection, the reason for the appointment may be that Dudley's soldier grandfather Henry had served under Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln. The earl's estate in Lincolnshire was a center of Nonconformist thought, and Dudley was already recognized for his Puritan virtues by the time he entered the earl's service. [...] According to Cotton Mather's biography of Dudley, he successfully disentangled a legacy of financial difficulties bequeathed to the earl, and the earl consequently came to depend on Dudley for <b>financial</b> <b>advice.</b> [...] Dudley's services were not entirely pecuniary in nature: he is also said to have had an important role in securing the engagement of Clinton to Lord Saye's daughter. [...] In 1622, Dudley acquired the assistance of Simon Bradstreet who was eventually drawn to Dudley's daughter Anne. [...] The two were married six years later, when she was 16.|$|E
