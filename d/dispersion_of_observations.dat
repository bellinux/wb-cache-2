The parameters evaluated were hot carcass weight (221 estimates), cold carcass weight (232), hot carcass (236) and cold carcass yield (223), subcutaneous fat thickness (238) and the percentages of saw cut (233), forequarter (234) and sidecut (246 estimates). Initially, exploratory analysis was performed for each of the variables for detection of publication vices through the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> by pointing out the outliers eliminated. Normality tests were normal and the data were subjected to analysis of variance for the regression study, which were assessed to the third degree. Weights of hot carcass and cold carcass, hot and cold carcass yield and the percentage of saw cut had a quadratic effect on animals with the presence of zebu blood, indicating superiority of crossbred animals. The regression equation showed that 66; 50; 72; 81 and 59 % of zebu in crossbred animals showed higher hot and cold carcass weight, hot and cold carcass percentage and saw cut, respectively. Fat thickness was not influenced by the degree of zebu in the genotype. The percentage of forequarter has a positive response by increasing the degree of zebu in the genotype, while the sidecut has a negative answer. The crossbreeding between zebu and European breeds provides carcasses with better quality than purebred animals...|$|E
40|$|HE PRINCIPLE of {{the quality}} control chart {{originated}} with the pio-neering work of Shewhart in 1931 (1) {{in the application of}} statistical methods to industrial manufacturing problems. Great impetus to the use of these methods occurred during World War II in the fields of chemical process manufacturing and munitions (2). Application of the control chart to the control of accuracy and precision of chemi-cal analyses was a natural sequel (3, 4, 5). Levey and Jennings, in 1950 (6), were the first to suggest the use of the control chart in the clinical laboratory. The mechanics of the use of control charts and the desirability of their routine use is already firmly established. Unfortunately, how-ever, they do no good unless used, and the author doubts that as yet they enjoy very widespread use. This is not unexpected, since there is a natural reticence in a busy laboratory to install anything that means still more work. It is the responsibility of those with experi-ence with control charts to convince others that the small amount of added effort is actually worth while. This presentation consists of a brief review of the mechanics of those control charts most useful to the clinical chemist, followed by a discussion of their practical use illustrated by actual examples drawn from the author’s 10 years ’ ex-perience with control charts in the clinical laboratory.

40|$|Wind power {{forecasting}} (WPF) provides important inputs {{to power}} system operators and electricity market participants. It {{is therefore not}} surprising that WPF has attracted increasing interest within the electric power industry. In this report, we document our research on improving statistical WPF algorithms for point, uncertainty, and ramp forecasting. Below, we provide a brief introduction to the research presented in the following chapters. For a detailed overview of the state-of-the-art in wind power forecasting, we refer to [1]. Our related work on the application of WPF in operational decisions is documented in [2]. Point forecasts of wind power are highly dependent on the training criteria used in the statistical algorithms {{that are used to}} convert weather forecasts and observational data to a power forecast. In Chapter 2, we explore the application of information theoretic learning (ITL) as opposed to the classical minimum square error (MSE) criterion for point forecasting. In contrast to the MSE criterion, ITL criteria do not assume a Gaussian distribution of the forecasting errors. We investigate to what extent ITL criteria yield better results. In addition, we analyze time-adaptive training algorithms and how they enable WPF algorithms to cope with non-stationary data and, thus, to adapt to new situations without requiring additional offline training of the model. We test the new point forecasting algorithms on two wind farms located in the U. S. Midwest. Although there have been advancements in deterministic WPF, a single-valued forecast cannot provide information on the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> around the predicted value. We argue that it is essential to generate, together with (or as an alternative to) point forecasts, a representation of the wind power uncertainty. Wind power uncertainty representation can take the form of probabilistic forecasts (e. g., probability density function, quantiles), risk indices (e. g., prediction risk index) or scenarios (with spatial and/or temporal dependence). Statistical approaches to uncertainty forecasting basically consist of estimating the uncertainty based on observed forecasting errors. Quantile regression (QR) is currently a commonly used approach in uncertainty forecasting. In Chapter 3, we propose new statistical approaches to the uncertainty estimation problem by employing kernel density forecast (KDF) methods. We use two estimators in both offline and time-adaptive modes, namely, the Nadaraya-Watson (NW) and Quantilecopula (QC) estimators. We conduct detailed tests of the new approaches using QR as a benchmark. One of the major issues in wind power generation are sudden and large changes of wind power output over a short period of time, namely ramping events. In Chapter 4, we perform a comparative study of existing definitions and methodologies for ramp forecasting. We also introduce a new probabilistic method for ramp event detection. The method starts with a stochastic algorithm that generates wind power scenarios, which are passed through a high-pass filter for ramp detection and estimation of the likelihood of ramp events to happen. The report is organized as follows: Chapter 2 presents the results of the application of ITL training criteria to deterministic WPF; Chapter 3 reports the study on probabilistic WPF, including new contributions to wind power uncertainty forecasting; Chapter 4 presents a new method to predict and visualize ramp events, comparing it with state-of-the-art methodologies; Chapter 5 briefly summarizes the main findings and contributions of this report...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A design {{method is}} {{proposed}} that sequentially generates observation {{sites for the}} construction of a kriging predictive model. The objective of the construction is to allow a precise inversion of the system in the following sense: with any reachable target point T in the output space one wishes to be able to associate an input vector xT such that the system response at xT will be close to T (which requires that the model ensures a precise prediction of the response at xT). Intuitively, the observation sites should not be spread over the admissible input space, but should rather concentrate in areas such that, when mapped by the system, they cover the reachable output space. Two approaches are proposed that are shown on examples (one with five input and two outputs, derived from a problem in oil industry) to give satisfactory results. They are based on the maximization of a measure <b>of</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>observations</b> in the output space and can cope with the presence <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> errors, a rather typical situation for experimentation with real physical systems. 1...|$|R

40|$|The stars {{observed}} by onboard star trackers must {{be identified in}} order for the star tracker information to be used for attitude determination. Star identification associates the observed stars in the body frame with catalog stars, the positions of which in an inertial frame are well known. If the attitude is approximately known (from less accurate sensors) identification is relatively simple, but if there is no prior attitude knowledge (the Lost in Space problem) star identification is quite difficult. A new, reliable, and accurate star identification algorithm has been developed for use in a batch, ground-based attitude determination system. The identification algorithm uses input from one or more star trackers, each of which can observe three or more stars simultaneously. If observations are available at different times, rate data is used to relate them. The algorithm includes the following steps that are automatically performed: 1) Observations are examined to determine the optimal set <b>of</b> simultaneous star <b>observations</b> in a single tracker. 2) The selected optimal observations are identified using a triplet match. 3) The identified stars in the selected tracker at the selected time are used to compute an attitude at that time. 4) The rate data is refined by determination of biases that minimize the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repeated <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> the same stars. 5) The refined rate data is used to propagate the attitude to the times <b>of</b> each star <b>observation.</b> 6) The attitude at each time is used to associate all stars observed at that time, in each tracker, with catalog stars.

40|$|We have {{performed}} detailed dynamical modeling {{of the structure}} of a faint dust band observed in coadded InfraRed Astronomical Satellite data at an ecliptic latitude of 17 degrees that convincingly demonstrates that it {{is the result of a}} relatively recent (significantly less than 1 Ma) disruption of an asteroid and is still in the process of forming. We show here that young dust bands retain information on the size distribution and cross-sectional area of dust released in the original asteroid disruption, before it is lost to orbital and collisional decay. We find that the Emilkowalski cluster is the source of this partial band and that the dust released in the disruption would correspond to a regolith layer similar to 3 m deep on the similar to 10 km diameter source body's surface. The dust in this band is described by a cumulative size-distribution inverse power-law index with a lower bound of 2. 1 (implying domination of cross-sectional area by small particles) for dust particles with diameters ranging from a few mu m up to a few cm. The coadded observations show that the thermal emission of the dust band structure is dominated by large (mm-cm size) particles.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Long QT {{syndrome}} (LQTS) {{is associated}} with sudden cardiac death resulting from torsades de pointes (TdP), which are triggered by early afterdepolarizations (EADs). The cardiac Na(+) /Ca(2 +) exchanger (NCX) has been suggested {{to work as a}} trigger for EADs. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that inhibition of NCX with a newly developed selective NCX inhibitor (SEA 0400) reduces TdP. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 34 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, the I(Kr) -blocker sotalol (100 microM; n = 18) as well as veratridine (0. 5 microM; n = 16), an inhibitor of sodium channel inactivation, led to a significant increase in monophasic action potential (MAP) duration thereby mimicking LQTS 2 and LQTS 3. In bradycardic hearts, recordings of eight MAPs demonstrated an increased <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repolarization (sotalol: 67 %; veratridine: 89 %; P <. 05). After lowering of potassium concentration, sotalol (56 %) and veratridine (63 %) induced TdP. Perfusion with SEA 0400 (1 microM) suppressed EADs in 15 of 16 sotalol hearts and in seven of 13 veratridine hearts. SEA 0400 significantly shortened MAP duration and reduced <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repolarization in both groups (P <. 05). This reduced TdP incidence in the sotalol group (100 %) and in the veratridine group (77 %). To investigate the effects of NCX inhibition on the cellular level, we used a computer model of the rabbit ventricular myocyte. I(Na) and I(Kr) were modified to mimic the effects of veratridine and sotalol, respectively. Consistent with our in vitro experiments, reduction of NCX activity accelerated repolarization of the cellular action potential and prevented EADs. CONCLUSION: In an intact rabbit heart model of LQT 2 and LQT 3 as well as in a computer model of the rabbit cardiac myocyte, inhibition of NCX is effective in preventing TdP due to a suppression of EADs, a reversion of action potential prolongation, and a reduction <b>of</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repolarization.

40|$|To {{study the}} role <b>of</b> the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> atrial repolarization (DAR) in {{the genesis of}} atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF), monophasic action potentials (MAP) were recorded simultaneously from a catheter at the high lateral right atrium (HLRA) and a catheter moving around the high, middle and low lateral right atrium (RA) the high, anterior and posterior septal RA and the RA appendage in 15 patients with paroxysmal AF and 15 patients with atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT) or concealed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) without history of AF. After recordings during sinus rhythm (SR), MAPs were recorded during programmed stimulation (PS) via the HLRA catheter at a drive cycle length (CL) of 500 ms. Thus, MAPs were recorded simultaneously from 2 sites {{at a time and}} sequentially from 4 to 12 sites during SR, drive pacing and PS. Taking the MAP at the HLRA as reference, the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repolarization time (<b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> RT) and its two components, the <b>dispersions</b> <b>of</b> activation time (<b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> AT) and MAP duration (<b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> MAP duration) among the 4 to 12 sites were calculated and taken as parameters of DAR. RESULTS: During SR and PS, the maximal <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> RT was significantly greater in AF than in control patients, 113 +/- 49 ms vs 50 +/- 28 ms (P< 0. 001) and 114 +/- 56 vs 70 +/- 43 ms (P< 0. 05) respectively. The increased <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> RT in the AF group was caused by increases in both <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> MAP duration and <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> AT. CONCLUSION: During SR and PS, DAR increased in patients with paroxysmal AF due to increases in <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> MAP duration and <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> AT, which suggests the involvement of both repolarization and conduction disturbances in the development of paroxysmal AF...|$|R
40|$|We use a {{panel of}} more than 100, 000 {{investor}} accounts in US stocks over the period 1991 - 1995 to construct an investor-based measure <b>of</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> opinion, unlike the analyst based measure used in the literature. We use this measure to test two competing hypotheses: the sidelined investors hypothesis and the uncertainty/asymmetric information hypothesis. We find evidence that supports the sidelined-investors hypothesis. We show that the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> opinion of the investors in a stock is positively related to the contemporaneous returns and trading volume of the stock and negatively related to its future returns. Moreover, <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> opinion aggregates across many stocks and generates factors that have a market-wide effect, affecting the stock equilibrium rate of return and providing additional explanatory power in a standard asset-pricing model. This supports the interpretation <b>of</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> opinion as a risk factor. We also show that <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> opinion among retail investors Granger causes <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> opinion among analysts. <b>Dispersion</b> <b>of</b> opinion, asset prices, volatility...|$|R
50|$|In 1914 each fort also {{possessed a}} {{detachment}} of infantry which in theory could make sorties onto the surrounding cleared areas to harass a besieging enemy. In practice, {{it was impossible}} to make such sorties under German artillery fire. Happily for the defenders, the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> German artillery fire was considerable. At least 60% of German shells, and more for large pieces, failed to find their targets. The fortress guns were less powerful than the German guns, but were more accurate and could take advantage <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> and fire support provided by neighboring forts.|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to {{structure}} the heuristic process of extrapolating trending geologic bodies in the analytic framework of Bayesian inference. The approach models spatial properties of trending bodies rather than geological processes, and includes components of uncertainty arising out of trend model selection. Inclusion of several components of uncertainty leads to rapid <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> the probability density of predicted location away from the region <b>of</b> <b>observations,</b> in conformity with the intuitive notion of valid distances of prediction. The philosophical foundations of exploration {{and the role of}} probabilistic predictions in decisionmaking are briefly discussed...|$|R
