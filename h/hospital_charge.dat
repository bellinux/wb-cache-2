The limits on income assessed for social insurance contributions were raised and the income base upon which employers and the self-employed were assessed for contributions was changed. The cost of support for handicapped adults was transferred to the national government, although some taxation on tobacco and alcohol was also earmarked for this purpose. A 1% tax on personal incomes was imposed (although the poorest 33% of taxpayers was excluded), and a 1% “solidarity” contribution levied on civil servants towards the cost of unemployment insurance. In spite of austerity, however, the real value of social protection made modest increases. Within the total, the greatest benefits was reserved for the poorest whilst income was raised in ways which saw a modest shift from traditional financing methods towards general community financing.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Percutaneous transluminal {{angioplasty}} with stenting (PTAS) of the {{carotid artery}} has been advocated {{as an alternative}} treatment for high-grade stenosis. Rationale for this approach includes less morbidity, shorter recovery, and lower cost when compared with carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Methods: The clinical results and <b>hospital</b> <b>charges</b> of patients who underwent elective treatment for carotid stenosis were reviewed. During a concurrent 14 -month period, 218 patients were admitted 229 times for 234 procedures {{for the treatment of}} 239 carotid bifurcation stenoses, 109 by PTAS and 130 by CEA. <b>Hospital</b> <b>charges</b> were reviewed for each hospitalization and were categorized according to radiology, operating room, cardiac catheterization laboratory, and all other <b>hospital</b> <b>charges.</b> Results: The combined incidence of postprocedure strokes and deaths were: PTAS, eight strokes (7. 7 %) and one death (0. 9 %); CEA, two strokes (1. 5 %) and two deaths (1. 5 %). Total <b>hospital</b> <b>charges</b> per admission for the two groups were $ 30, 140 for PTAS and $ 21, 670 for CEA. The average postprocedure length of stay for PTAS was 2. 9 days (median, 2 days) and for CEA was 3. 1 days (median, 3 days). Cardiac catheterization laboratory charges for the PTAS group were $ 12, 968, whereas the operating room charges for the CEA group were $ 4263. When hospitalizations that were extended by complications were excluded, the average total charges for the PTAS group (n = 84) dropped to $ 24, 848 (mean length of stay, 1. 9 days) and for the CEA group (n = 111) to $ 19, 247 (mean length of stay, 2. 6 days). Conclusions: After evaluating <b>hospital</b> <b>charges,</b> PTAS for the treatment of carotid stenosis cannot currently be justified on the basis of reduced costs alone.

40|$|Abstract — We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} alcohol-related medical emergencies on health care utilization in an inner city hospital medical intensive care unit (ICU). Data from 200 consecutive admissions to the medical ICU were collected prospectively The major reason for each patient's admission to the ICU was recorded and the causal relationship between alcohol abuse and the admission diagnosis was determined. Clinical and demographic data {{as well as the}} insurance status and cost of goods and services delivered were determined for all patients. Twenty-one per cent of all the ICU admissions were directly alcohol-related, with a mean <b>hospital</b> <b>charge</b> of $ 52, 527. The alcohol-withdrawal syndrome was the commonest alcohol-related admission, with a mean ICU stay of 5 days and a mean <b>hospital</b> <b>charge</b> of $ 21, 336. Of the patients with non-alcohol related admission diagnoses, 61 % had health insurance, compared to 42 % for the patients with alcohol-related admission diagnoses (P < 0. 05). Patients with alcohol-related admissions tended to be younger and male. In conclusion, we demonstrated that alcohol-related admissions are common in inner city hospital ICUs and consume considerable hospital resources. The treatment of these patients is costly, with hospitalization being essentially non-curative. In this era of health care reform, more effective primary and secondary preventative measures are required to control this pervasive health care problem...|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{models have}} been used to assess the {{influence}} of clinical and demographic factors on <b>hospital</b> <b>charge</b> and length of stay (LOS). Hospital costs constitute a significant proportion of overall expenditure in health care. With escalating costs, knowing the correlates of LOS and in-hospital cost is important for decisions on allocating resources. However, <b>hospital</b> <b>charge</b> and LOS are correlated. We describe two regression models that permit estimation of mean charges as a function of patient hospital stay and adjust for the influence of patient characteristics and treatment procedures on LOS and charge. In the first model, the mean charge over a specified duration is a weighted average of the expected cumulative charge, with weighting determined by the distribution of LOS. The second model for LOS and charge explicitly accounts for their correlation and yields estimates of the average charge per average LOS. The methods are applied to assess mean charges and mean charge per day by cardiac procedure in a cohort of patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction, while adjusting for the impact of patient demographic and clinical factors on LOS and charge. For relatively short hospital stays, and when only total hospital charges are available, these models provide a flexible approach to estimating summary measures on resource use while controlling for the effects of covariates on LOS and charge.
