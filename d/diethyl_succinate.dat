40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the synthesis of}} two photochromic 2 -indolyl-fulgides by stobbe condensation of the corresponding 2 -acyl- 1, 3 -dimethyl-indole derivatives with <b>diethyl</b> isopropylidene <b>succinate</b> {{in the presence of}} hexamethyldisilazane potassium. The overall yields was up to 41 % for 3 steps. Both prepared compounds are sensitive to UV light and change colors upon irradiation. And the two fulgides can be switched back and forth 100 times without obvious degradation. Thermal stabilities of the fulgides in acetonitrile at room temperature for 30 days and at 80 °C for 12 h were measured using UV-vis and 1 H NMR spectroscopy. The absorption spectra of both forms did not exhibit any sign of degradation. The NMR data indicated that no new compounds were detected.

40|$|Extract] The organophosphorous {{compound}} malathion (<b>diethyl</b> (dimethoxy thiophosphorylthio) <b>succinate</b> or S-[1, 2 -di(ethoxycarhonyl) ethyll O,O-dimethyl-phosphorothioate) is a yellow to deep-brown liquid with an odor of garlic {{which has a}} spectrum of activity such {{that it is a}} suitable acaricide and pediculicide. It is not volatile and is slightly soluble in water, alcohols, and aromatic solvents, but of limited solubility in petroleum oils. It remains biologically active for approximately two years if stored unopened in a cool, shaded, and well-aired environment at 68 - 86 ºF. It is available in a variety of formulations such as emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powder, dustable powder and ultra-low-volume liquid formulations.

40|$|Mitochondrial {{dysfunction}} plays {{a pivotal}} {{role in the development of}} aging phenotypes and aging-associated neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Strategies that restore mitochondrial dysfunction may rescue the deficits of central metabolism in these disorders and improve cell survival. For example, we found that modulating the mTOR signaling pathway in a tissue culture model of aging-induced mitochondrial DNA mutation enhanced mitochondrial function as evidenced by increased oxygen consumption. Our previous melatonin studies also led us to hypothesize that caloric restriction and the hormone melatonin would reverse brain mitochondrial dysfunction in animal models of AD. Although caloric restriction did not improve mitochondrial function in a transgenic P 301 L tau model of AD, novel insight into the regulation of F 0 -F 1 ATP synthase activity under CR was gained that may help explain the protective effects of CR in other disease models. In addition, we determined the effects of melatonin treatment on brain mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity using the transgenic APPSWE mouse model of AD bred to double melatonin receptor (MT 1 and MT 2) knockout mice. COX activity declined with aging in control mice, but increased with aging in AD mice, most likely as a response to mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by amyloid-beta generated through APP proteolysis. Both effects were blunted by melatonin treatment. The effects of melatonin were partially dependent on the G-protein coupled melatonin receptors. We also used PD models to identify therapies that restore mitochondrial dysfunction. We showed that overexpression of wild-type alpha synuclein (α-syn) in human neuroblastoma M 17 cells resulted in mitochondrial oxygen consumption deficits; similar to the levels observed when PD mutant forms (A 30 P α-syn, E 46 K α-syn, and, A 53 T α-syn) were overexpressed. Mitochondria from cells overexpressing α-syn were more sensitive to a high iron environment, mimicking the physiological conditions in which dopaminergic neurons are found. <b>Diethyl</b> oxaloacetate, <b>succinate,</b> and several amino acids were protective, suggesting the possibility for effective dietary interventions for PD. Lastly, we delineated the level of mitochondrial complex IV activity between gray and white matter in human cervical and lumbar spinal cord, as well as mitochondrial aggregation in the entire neurovascular units (NVU) as a consequence of ALS. At the conclusion of these projects a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD, PD, ALS, and aging was gained and promising strategies to delay or reverse these dysfunctions were developed...|$|R

Recently four esters produced from fermentation, <b>diethyl</b> <b>succinate,</b> dibutyl succinate, dibutyl fumarate and dibutyl malonate {{were reported to have}} suitable physical properties to conventional diesel fuel. While physical properties are indicative of fuel behaviour, the determination of a fuel’s combustion emissions and performance via controlled engine testing is vital. In this investigation the engine performance and emissions produced from the most viable fuel, <b>diethyl</b> <b>succinate</b> (DES), were examined. The <b>diethyl</b> <b>succinate</b> was blended with diesel in a 20 % blend (DES 20), due to the low cetane number of the <b>diethyl</b> <b>succinate,</b> and the emissions established under pseudo steady state conditions using a 2. 0 L turbocharged direct-injection EURO 3 -compliant light commercial vehicle equipped with a direct-injection common-rail diesel engine. When using DES 20, the fuel demand and wheel force were higher across the majority of engine speeds, while exhaust gas temperatures were lower. The difference between DES 20 and diesel’s exhaust gas temperature increased with increasing pedal demand. In comparison to petroleum-derived diesel carbon monoxide (CO) emissions were reduced on using DES 20, most likely due to more complete combustion due to the increased oxygen content. However, the total hydrocarbons (THC) and mono-nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions were shown to increase on using the DES blend. Both of these factors were presumably due to the lower cetane number of the fuel, though the increase in THC was deemed negligible due to the low amount produced by both fuels...|$|E

40|$|Chemical pulp mills such as Kraft, soda, or sulfite mills are current {{examples}} of biorefineries that can convert lignocellulosic biomass into energy, pulp or cellulose derivatives, and tall oil.   While existing viscose pulps use a hemicellulose extraction to generate soluble sugars for ethanol production, in general there still exists a large potential for other more profitable {{applications of the}} biomass (Fig. 1), i. e. the mill needs to present a widespread product portfolio.   The biofuels under development from fermentation that will be discussed are the diesel fuel oxygenates dibutyl succinate and <b>diethyl</b> <b>succinate</b> {{to be used for}} reduced particulate emissions and fossil fuel replacement for diesel engines and butanol for Otto engines.   It's important to stress that succinic acid, butanol and ethanol, needed for the production of the diesel additives and gasoline replacement will be produced from renewable resources and hence replacing products currently produced from non-renewable fossil sources.   Since wood will be used, there will be no issue of competing with raw material used for food production.   Besides biofuel production, succinic acid and butanol, can be used directly or further refined into numerous different products classified as green chemicals.

40|$|Beer {{stability}} {{is a major}} concern for the brewing industry, as beer characteristics may be subject to significant changes during storage. This paper describes a novel non-targeted methodology for monitoring the chemical changes occurring in a lager beer exposed to accelerated aging (induced by thermal treatment: 18 days at 45 ◦C), using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry in tandem with multivariate analysis (GC–MS/MVA). Optimization of the chromatographic run was performed, achieving a threefold reduction of the chromatographic time. Although losing optimum resolution, rapid GC runs showed similar chromatographic profiles and semi-quantitative ability to characterize volatile compounds. To evaluate the variations on the global volatile signature (chromatographic profile and m/z pattern of fragmentation in each scan) of beer during thermal deterioration, a non-supervised multivariate analysis method, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), was applied to the GC–MS data. This methodology allowed not only the rapid identification of the degree of deterioration affecting beer, but also the identification of specific compounds of relevance to the thermal deterioration process of beer, both well established markers such as 5 -hydroxymethylfufural (5 -HMF), furfural and <b>diethyl</b> <b>succinate,</b> as well as other compounds, to our knowledge, newly correlated to beer aging.

40|$|Extensive calorimetric {{investigations}} on {{the interaction}} of TiCl 4 with some Lewis bases are presented. Some of the bases were chosen for their industrial relevance in heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta polymerization of propene (ethyl benzoate, L 2, diisobutyl phthalate, L 3, (2 R, 3 S) -diethyl 2, 3 -diisopropylsuccinate, L 6, (2 S, 3 S) -diethyl 2, 3 -diisopropylsuccinate, L 7, and 9, 9 -bis(methoxymethyl) - 9 H-fluorene, L 13) while other bases were chosen as probe molecules to explore the electronic and steric effects on the complexation energy (ethyl acetate, L 1, diethyl phthalate, L 4, <b>diethyl</b> <b>succinate,</b> L 5, tetrahydrofuran, L 8, dimethoxyethane, L 9, dimethoxypropane, L 10, dimethoxybutane, L 11, and 3, 3 -bis(methoxymethyl) - 2, 6 -dimethylheptane, L 12). 1, 1, 2, 2,-Tetrachloroethane {{was selected as the}} solvent for its low donating properties, which allows the focus to be on the metal-donor interaction. The calorimetric data are discussed and compared with the efficiency of the derived catalysts. Further understanding is obtained by comparison of the experimental results with theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The performance of different computational approaches was validated by comparison of the calculated and experimental complexation energies...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the role of}} {{different}} yeast strains {{in the production of}} volatile flavour components of Tokaji Aszú wine was tested. The effect of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae starter and that of the typical endogenous Candida stellata strain as well as spontaneous fermentation were studied and compared. For the fast comparison of aroma profile, a solid phase microextraction (SPME) sampling and a GC-MS separation and identification were used. Thirty of the present compounds were selected to characterise the changes of flavour. Significant differences were found between wines fermented with different yeast strains. Application of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae starter alone accelerated the fermentation but this caused only little change in the aroma profile and content. Candida stellata contributed weakly to the production of aroma, especially to that of the longer carbon chain ethyl esters. Characteristic compounds of aged wine were detected in bottle aged Tokaji Aszú. The change of aroma profile as a function of bottle storage time was studied. The concentrations of vitispirane, trimethyl dihydronaphtalene, 2 -phenylethanol and <b>diethyl</b> <b>succinate</b> increased in the course of ageing time, while those of 3 -methyl-butyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate and ethyl dodecanoate decreased...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Chemistry) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. Fused ring carbocycles {{containing}} an eight-membered ring {{are found}} in many biologically active natural products and are typically used as target molecules in natural product synthesis. Although generating these types of compounds is difficult due to the enthalpic and entropic barriers associated with large rings, there is an ongoing effort in developing new methodologies that are both novel and efficient. This work utilized samarium(II) iodide (SmI 2) as a single electron reductant to promote the synthesis of an eight-membered ring through a monoradical cyclization and fragmentation sequence. Initial studies concluded that the ??-keto ester was unsuitable under unstabilized Wittig reaction conditions. Because the alkene functionality was required for cyclization, a new compound was synthesized using a stabilized Wittig reagent to generate a cyclopropane with either an E or Z alkene appendage. Upon cyclization studies using SmI 2, {{it was found that}} neither a 6 -exo-trig cyclization to v i generate a six membered ring nor a 7 -endo-trig cyclization to generate an eight membered ring took place but that SmI 2 preferentially reduced the electron-deficient conjugated alkene to generate a <b>diethyl</b> <b>succinate.</b> Chemistr...|$|E
