5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), {{and several}} other FBI agents take part in an {{undercover}} operation in a Washington park to catch Jacob Haley (Daniel von Bargen), the second-in-command of an anti-government militia called the New Spartans. As Skinner and Scully monitor the operation from a van, Mulder and the other agents slowly close in on Haley. Haley hands an envelope to another man (Armin Moattar) before escaping. The agents discover that the man's flesh has been <b>eaten</b> <b>away</b> by an unknown toxin.|$|E
5|$|While in the tunnels, Melnick gets a burn on {{the back}} of his neck {{suggesting}} a chemical leak. However, the test of the nearby puddle shows nothing dangerous: it is just salt water. Melnick mentions that the tunnels run along the harbor in some places and that they get sea water leakages from time to time. Moving ahead, the team finds an abandoned section of the subway tunnels. Out of the tunnel bursts a man with his rib cage and teeth exposed who knocks Doggett down: he is the suspected robber, <b>eaten</b> <b>away</b> like the other man. His condition proves that he did not kill the man and that there may, in fact, be a contagion. While looking around, the teams discover three bodies with the same gruesome injuries, wrapped in plastic. It soon becomes clear that someone is covering up the problem in the subway.|$|E
5|$|John's {{situation}} {{began to}} deteriorate rapidly. The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years, whilst Angevin {{authority in the}} south had been undermined by Richard's giving away of various key castles some years before. His use of routier mercenaries in the central regions had rapidly <b>eaten</b> <b>away</b> his remaining support in this area too, which {{set the stage for}} a sudden collapse of Angevin power. John retreated back across the Channel in December, sending orders for the establishment of a fresh defensive line to the west of Chateau Gaillard. In March 1204, Gaillard fell. John's mother Eleanor died the following month. This was not just a personal blow for John, but threatened to unravel the widespread Angevin alliances across the far south of France. Philip moved south around the new defensive line and struck upwards at the heart of the Duchy, now facing little resistance. By August, Philip had taken Normandy and advanced south to occupy Anjou and Poitou as well. John's only remaining possession on the Continent was now the Duchy of Aquitaine.|$|E

5|$|Ralston, who {{considered}} the Enterprise ugly {{and the model}} hard to shoot, delighted in destroying the ship. Several shots were combined together for the complete destruction sequence; while Ralston {{would have preferred to}} take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The first part of the ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature with stars added to the background. The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the saucer burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity) were superimposed over a motion control pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being <b>eaten</b> <b>away</b> by inner explosions. George created a light Styrofoam model that was dissolved by acetone dripped on the saucer from above. By shooting at less than one frame per second and keeping light off the model, the drips were not visible in the print. Burning steel wool {{on the inside of the}} saucer created a glowing ember effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed. The saucer explosion was simulated by blowing up a talcum powder-covered plaster dish. Two and fourounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.|$|E
5|$|At {{his trial}} in Clearwater, Florida, Chandler {{said that he}} met the Rogers women and gave them directions, but he never saw them again except in {{newspaper}} coverage and on billboards. He never told the authorities {{that he had seen}} the women again. He acknowledged that he was on Tampa Bay that nightthe police had evidence of three ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home during the time frame of the murdersbut Chandler maintained that he was fishing alone. He claimed that he had returned home late because his engine would not start, which he attributed to a gas line leak. He said that he had called the Coast Guard and the Florida Marine Patrol, and had flagged down a patrol boat, but both were too busy to help. He said that he subsequently fixed the line with duct tape and returned safely to shore. However, there were no records of distress calls from Chandler to either the Coast Guard or the Marine Patrol that night, nor were there any Coast Guard boats on the bay the following morning that could have helped him. According to a boat mechanic, who testified for the prosecution, Chandler's explanation of repairing the boat's alleged gas leak was not tenable because the fuel lines in his boata Baylinerwere directed upward. A leak would have sprayed fuel into the air rather than into the boat, and the corrosive gasoline would have <b>eaten</b> <b>away</b> the adhesive properties of the duct tape Chandler maintained he had used to repair the purported leak. Under interrogation from Pinellas County prosecutor, Douglas Crow, Chandler then said he could not remember.|$|E

25|$|In {{numerous}} {{cases in}} both the 1794 print and the 1795 print, {{it seems as if}} the acid has <b>eaten</b> <b>away</b> too much of the relief, and Blake has had to go over sections with ink and wash, often touching the text and design outlines with pen. This ink and wash work may have been executed in 1818, along with the addition of the frame lines, although this cannot be ascertained for certain. Several of the plates also bear evidence of rudimentary colour printing, a method with which Blake was experimenting in the 1790s, and these plates may represent his first attempts at this technique (whereby he used coloured inks to print rather than black). Several of the plates also feature examples of white line engraving, a technique where Blake would literally cut into the stop-out to create tiny furrows, which would be <b>eaten</b> <b>away</b> by the acid, creating a streak effect in the final print.|$|E

25|$|The wreck was rediscovered in 1984 by Port Dover, Ontario diver Michael Lynn Fletcher; {{the aquatic}} plants {{formerly}} covering the wreck were largely <b>eaten</b> <b>away</b> by zebra mussels. In 1991, a California-based diving company, Mar-Dive, {{announced that they}} had found Atlantic, and paid the state of Ohio $14,000 to reform the Western Wrecking Company. But since Atlantic rests inside Canadian waters, the government of Ontario moved to prevent the removal of artifacts from Atlantic, taking the issue to Ontario divisional court. The judge ruled that Atlantic belonged to Ontario. To protect the wreck, an electronic monitoring system was installed that will alert the Ontario Provincial Police if a vessel stays for too long above the wreck.|$|E
25|$|This lengthy-titled artwork {{features}} a large Tiger Shark suspended in formaldehyde, {{the most well-known}} of his series ‘Natural History’. This series is said to “contain some of the artist’s most widely recognized and important works”. The tank in which the shark is floating creates the illusion of the animal being cut into three pieces due to the container looking like three separate blocks. The work itself is very simplistic, featuring only the shark in a watery substance, which at first glance looks clear like glass. The piece itself is fairly old, having been created in 1991. Because of this, the formaldehyde preserving the shark has slowly <b>eaten</b> <b>away</b> at the animal’s body, showing signs of decay.|$|E

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 February 1942, lookouts on Christmas Island spotted an object out at sea, which on closer inspection {{turned out to be}} a carley float carrying the body of a Caucasian man wearing a blue boilersuit that had been sun-bleached white. The flesh of his right arm had been <b>eaten</b> <b>away</b> by fish, and his eyes and nose consumed by birds. Shrapnel was embedded in the float's outer covering, while the proliferation of marine growth indicated that it had been adrift for some time. As the island was under threat of Japanese invasion, after a brief examination, the body was buried in an unmarked grave near Flying Fish Cove. Evacuation began on 17 February with Japanese forces occupying the island on 23 March.|$|E
25|$|San Cristóbal has the second-lowest rate of {{economic}} marginalization {{in the state}} of Chiapas following Tuxtla Gutiérrez. Only 4.5% of workers do not receive a salary or a regular income. Approximately 9% are employed in agriculture, compared to 54.86% regionally and 47.25% in the state. 21% are employed in construction, energy and transportation. The most important sector by economic output is mining. About 600 truckloads of jade, gravel, stone and metals are exported from San Cristóbal daily. Most of the material is destined to other municipalities in the region, although some goes to other cities in Chiapas and to states such as Tabasco and Campeche. This heavy strip mining has gradually <b>eaten</b> <b>away</b> at the natural landscape of some areas and has negatively affected the recharge of surface and subsurface water.|$|E
25|$|Insects are {{valuable}} as forensic indicators {{in cases of}} abuse and neglect. Some insects, such as the Green Bottle Fly, (Lucilia sericata (Meigen)), are drawn to odors, such as ammonia, resulting from urine or fecal contamination. Adult green bottle flies tend to be attracted to an incontinent individual who lacks the voluntary control of excretory functions. Such examples include a baby who has not had its diapers changed often or an incontinent elderly person {{who has not been}} helped in maintaining routine bodily hygiene. Flies lay their eggs in and around clothing and skin which, if left undiscovered, will hatch into maggots (larvae) which begin feeding upon flesh, open wounds, ulcers, and any natural bodily entry point. Over time, the flesh will be <b>eaten</b> <b>away,</b> and the region may be further infected by bacteria or invaded by other insects. This is known as myiasis.|$|E
