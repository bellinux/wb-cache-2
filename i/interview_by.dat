Chambers was roundly condemned for his comments in the <b>interview</b> <b>by</b> both the press and his former colleagues in the athletics world, including Sir Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Sebastian Coe, although former 100m world record holder Asafa Powell supported Chambers' claims.|$|E

5|$|One {{measure of}} an instrument's {{usefulness}} {{is to see}} how closely it agrees with another similar instrument that has been validated against information from a clinical <b>interview</b> <b>by</b> a trained clinician.

The test was also shown {{to have a high}} one-week test–retest reliability (Pearson r =0.93), suggesting that it was not overly sensitive to daily variations in mood.

5|$|Even though Kern {{intended}} for the character's morality to be left ambiguous and to the viewer's interpretation, a majority of television commentators characterized Christy as an antagonist.

In their book The Book of Three, authors Diana G. Gallagher and Paul Ruditis wrote that she served as the Triad's protégée. Ruditis followed this up in a later <b>interview</b> <b>by</b> calling Christy a pawn {{under the control of}} the Triad rather than a proper villain; he found that the series lacked a strong, female antagonist.|$|E
