5|$|Following the United States Grand Prix on 24 September, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at various racing circuits across Europe between 26–29 September {{to prepare for}} the Grand Prix. McLaren's test driver Olivier Panis flew to the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours to undertake preparations for Suzuka and development work on their 2001 car. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent two days at the Fiorano Circuit testing mechanical components and ran on an artificially wet track for testing of Bridgestone's wet weather tyre compounds. Williams, with rookie competitor Jenson Button, went to the Autódromo do Estoril for two days and tried wet weather tyres and different aerodynamic configurations. Prost travelled to Magny-Cours and their test driver Stéphane Sarrazin collected three days of chassis <b>design</b> <b>data</b> for the upcoming AP04 chassis. Benetton opted to miss testing prior to the event but their test driver Mark Webber tried developments at the Circuit de Catalunya that were incorporated into their 2001 car.|$|E

40|$|We {{recently}} completed a study which demonstrated {{that the costs of}} health technology assessment (HTA) by randomised controlled trial (RCT) can be reduced by substituting routine datasets for <b>data</b> <b>designed</b> and collected specifically for a trial. This cost reduction, however, had the effect of reducing the quality of the research output. In the present study we attempted to tease out the values attached to the 'better' information provided by <b>designed</b> <b>data</b> RCTs using a mock grants committee. Two valuation techniques, implied values and willingness to pay, were used. Ex ante valuations were determined by comparing alternative research proposals - a more costly version using <b>designed</b> <b>data</b> and a cheaper version using routine data. Ex post valuations were determined by comparing results of both versions. The exercise was performed on four exemplar studies. Overall, the committee expressed a general lack of trust towards routine data both ex ante and ex post and placed high values on the better information from the <b>designed</b> <b>data</b> studies - particularly information on preferences. This suggests that currently available routine datasets are not perceived to be able to provide efficient alternatives to <b>designed</b> <b>data</b> for RCTs.

25|$|Faced {{with limited}} amounts of {{existing}} relevant information from available sources {{upon which to}} base the aircraft's design, Miles turned {{to the field of}} ballistics instead. He had reasoned that, as it was widely known that bullets could attain supersonic speeds, aerodynamic properties that would enable an aircraft to be capable of becoming supersonic would likely to be present amongst such shapes. In particular, as a result of studying this <b>design</b> <b>data,</b> the emerging aircraft would feature both a conical nose and very thin elliptical wings complete with sharp leading edges. This contrasted against many early jet aircraft, which were furnished with round noses, thick wings and hinged elevators, resulting in these aircraft possessing critical Mach numbers that were below the speed of sound and thus were less suitable for research into high subsonic speeds (in dives) than the earlier Supermarine Spitfire with its thinner wings. In 1943, RAE tests conducted using Spitfires had proved that drag was the main factor that would need to be addressed by high-speed aircraft.|$|E

Menzies replied that he could not authorise the test until after the Australian federal election, to be held on 28 April 1951, but was willing to allow work to continue. Menzies was re-elected, and the Australian government formally agreed in May 1951. On 28 May, Attlee sent a comprehensive list of assistance that it hoped that Australia would provide. A more detailed survey was requested, which was carried out by [...] in July and August 1951. [...] The British government emphasised the importance of security, so as not to imperil its negotiations with the United States. The Australian government gave all weapon <b>design</b> <b>data</b> a classification of [...] "Top Secret", with all other aspects of the test being [...] "Classified".

The United Kingdom owns 58 missiles which are shared in a joint pool with the United States government and these are exchanged when requiring maintenance with missiles from the United States Navy's own pool and vice versa. Some non-nuclear components for the British nuclear warhead are procured from the U.S. for reasons of cost effectiveness.|$|E

The necessary material's date are filed in a floppy disk from which the require data can be easily selected for variations in the design.
