They were all so fucking serious, trying to be a voice for a generation or some shit like that, but worst of all they remained within the parameters of social acceptability. There was also a big censorship flap <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. We looked at it as a chance to catch up with our obscenity quota.|$|E

All the rocket scientists working on the project are German. At his post on the complex, Bond meets Gala Brand, a beautiful police Special Branch officer working undercover as Drax's personal assistant. Bond also uncovers clues concerning his predecessor's death, concluding that the man may have been killed for witnessing a submarine off the coast.|$|E
5|$|With 35 shotgun pellets {{still in}} his body, {{including}} three in the lining of his heart and five more embedded in his liver, LeMond attempted to return to racing in 1988. His comeback was hampered by over-training which resulted in tendonitis in his right shin requiring surgery. He missed the Tour {{for the second year}} running. Tensions in the relationship between LeMond and PDM were aggravated when LeMond discovered that doping was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> PDM squad. The result was that LeMond moved from PDM, one of the strongest teams in the peloton, to ADR, a team based in Belgium. The team was co-sponsored by Coors Light for American races. The deal was completed on New Year's Eve, just hours before LeMond would have been legally obligated to ride another season for the Dutch team. Joining the Belgian ADR squad allowed LeMond to continue to compete, but with teammates like Johan Museeuw who were better suited to riding Classics than Grand Tours.|$|E

25|$|The more {{permanent}} English settlers emigrated from the colony of Massachusetts Bay, {{most of them}} Puritans who were unhappy with the reforms <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.

Up until 1675, however, fighting had been limited to minor skirmishes that were more about the destruction of supplies than murder.|$|E

25|$|Ongoing {{repair work}} is {{interrupted}} by a recurrence of grey smoke from the south-east side of unit 3 (the general area of the spent-fuel pool) seen at 15:55 and dying down by 17:55. Employees are evacuated from unit 3, but no changes in radiation measurements or reactor status are seen. No work was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time (such as restoring power) which might have accounted for the fire. White smoke, probably steam, is also seen coming from unit 2 at 18:22 JST, accompanied by a temporary rise in radiation levels. A new power line is laid to unit 4 and unit 5 is transferred to its own external power from a transmission line instead of sharing the unit 6 diesel generators.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, {{due to a}} {{perceived}} need for Circassian ports and a view that an independent Circassia would impede their plans to extend into the Middle East (plans which were never achieved), Russia soon moved to annex Circassia. Tensions culminated in the devastating Russian-Circassian War, which in its later stages was eclipsed by the Crimean War. Despite {{the fact that a}} similar war was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> other side of the Caucasus (Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Dagestan fighting against Russia to preserve their states' existence), as well as the attempts of some (ranging from Circassian princes to Imam Shamil to Britain) to connect the two struggles, connections between the Circassians and their allies with their Eastern Caucasian counterparts were quashed by an Ossetian alliance with Russia.|$|E
25|$|Expanding his horizons he {{went into}} {{producing}} his own shows and often {{had more than one}} tour <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time. He wanted to move on from his circus clowning and reinvented himself as a gentleman. He started to take up politics and would often have Democratic undertones in his shows. He was then regarded as not only a multi-talented performer, but a smart and noble man who was to be looked up to. He won the affection of many newspapers and publicists including that of a then unknown Mark Twain and Walt Whitman. Mark Twain paid him homage in his description of a circus in Huckleberry Finn, and it is likely a boyhood Twain actually saw Rice perform when his circus came to Hannibal for a show.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, fashion had {{moved away from}} the unkempt hippie look and overdressed disco style of the late 1970s. Athletic clothes were more popular than jeans during this period, as were more subdued colors. Popular colors were black, white, indigo, forest green, burgundy, and {{different}} shades of browns, tans, and oranges. Velour, velvet, and polyester were popular fabrics used in clothes, especially button-up and v-neck shirts. Looser pants remained popular during this time, being fairly wide but straight, and tighter shirts were especially popular. The general public, at this time, wanted to wear low-maintenance clothing with more basic colors, as the global recession <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time kept extravagant clothes out of reach. Also worn were striped tube socks sometimes worn with the top folded over worn with shorts. It was not uncommon to see parents especially fathers wearing these along with their kids.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, two rest areas along Interstate80 {{were shut}} down due to chronic use for {{homosexual}} activities. The rest area in Lodi, next to westbound exit63, shut down on June 30, 1982 on request of the New Jersey State Police. Local lawyers noted that an uptick of summons were given at the rest area, including one motorist cited for not using parking lights. The State Police {{decided that it was}} not worth patrolling as it was an unattended rest area. The rest area at Roxbury in Morris County shut down in October1982. Opened in the 1970s, the borough noted {{that it was impossible to}} control the activity <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> location, including homosexual activities, alcohol and drug parties, theft and lewd acts. However, citing numerous accidents and needing a place for trucks to be able to rest, the stop re-opened in August 14, 1991 for truckers only.|$|E
25|$|John Bosco {{records that}} when Dominic {{arrived at the}} Oratory, he at once placed himself under his guidance. He also notes that Dominic worked {{diligently}} and followed the school rules. He would happily listen to talks and sermons (even if they tended to be lengthy at times), and would, without hesitation, ask for clarification on points that were not clear to him. John Bosco also notes how Dominic was obedient to his teachers and chose his companions carefully. This happened in the year 1854, while, in Rome, the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of Mary was being defined. Preparations for the observation of this feast were thus <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Oratory. Don Bosco records that, at {{the advice of his}} confessor, Dominic renewed his First Communion promises at the altar of Mary at the Oratory. John Bosco says that, from this point the result of Dominic's attempts towards holy life were so apparent, that he (John Bosco) took to recording the various incidents that occurred for future reference.|$|E
25|$|In 1887, he {{published}} Omul periculos, a pamphlet attacking the regnant House of Hohenzollern, accusing {{the king of}} abusing his prerogatives and allowing his ministers to ignore the constitution while suggesting he abdicate. Sued for lèse-majesté, {{he was sentenced to}} two years' imprisonment and a fine of 5000 lei. After writing an article to explain he was not fleeing but going into exile, he left for Vienna in May and was returned in absentia to the Assembly the following January, as an opposition member. In February, he was arrested but soon released, having gained parliamentary immunity. A government crisis was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time, and Panu, both in parliament and in Lupta, bitterly attacked the new government of Theodor Rosetti and the continued influence of Junimea. Later that year, he put forth a program for his party, which touched on subjects such as the peasantry, industrial development, relations between owners and workers, social insurance and universal suffrage. He shared these objectives with the socialists, along with an anti-dynastic outlook and calls for an eight-hour workday and Sundays off. However, his Radicals began to diverge from the socialists during the 1888 crisis: while the former took an active role both in parliament and in the streets, the latter kept its distance in the belief that the situation did not concern them.|$|E
