5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a <b>divergence</b> <b>indicator</b> which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the value of}} the RCU as a weighted average of East Asian currencies following the method used to calculate the ECU. The weight of component currencies is determined on the basis of each country's economic importance and contribution to regional cooperation such as the nominal GDP, GDP measured at purchasing power parity (PPP), intra-regional trade, and bilateral swap arrangement under the CMI. Two features are noteworthy. One is that the RCU value based on nominal GDP varies the most and the value based on PPP-GDP fluctuates the least. The other feature is that the trends of the RCU look very different according to the choice of the benchmark year. The RCU thus calculated {{can be used as a}} <b>divergence</b> <b>indicator</b> to monitor the exchange rate movement of East Asian currencies.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} semi-analytic {{solution}} (SAS) {{of a power}} system's differential-algebraic equation. A SAS is a closed-form function of symbolic variables including time, the initial state and the parameters on system operating conditions, and hence able to directly give trajectories on system state variables, which are accurate {{for at least a}} certain time window. A two-stage SAS-based approach for fast transient stability simulation is proposed, which offline derives the SAS by the Adomian Decomposition Method and online evaluates the SAS for each of sequential time windows until making up a desired simulation period. When applied to fault simulation, the new approach employs numerical integration only for the fault-on period to determine the post-disturbance initial state of the SAS. The paper further analyzes the maximum length of a time window for a SAS to keep its accuracy, and accordingly, introduces a <b>divergence</b> <b>indicator</b> for adaptive time windows.

Time series analyses were conducted to determine the spectral character of each record (delta 18 O of planktonic foraminifer, sea surface temperature values, equatorial <b>divergence</b> <b>indicators,</b> and wind intensity indicators) and to quantify interrecord coherence and phase relationships. The record was divided at the 300, 000 -year clear change in climatic variability (nonstationarity). The delta 18 O-based time scale is better lower in the core so our spectral analyses concentrated on the interval from 402, 000 - 774, 000 years. The delta 18 O spectra show 100, 000 - and 41, 000 -year power in the younger portion, 0 - 300, 000 years, and 100, 000 -, 41, 000 - and 23, 000 -year power in the older interval, all highly coherent and in phase with the SPECMAP average stacked isotope record. Unlike the isotope record the dominant period in both the eolian grain size and equatorial <b>divergence</b> <b>indicators</b> is 31, 000 years. This period is also important in the sea surface temperature signal where the dominant spectral peak is 100, 000 years.

Since the 31, 000 -year power appears in independent data sets within this core and also appears in other equatorial records [J. Imbrie personal communication, 1987], we assume it to be real and representative of both a nonlinear response to orbital forcing, possibly a combination of orbital tilt and eccentricity, and some resonance phenomenon required to amplify the response at this period so that it appears as a dominant frequency component.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} different {{properties of}} the regional currency unit (RCU) in Asia and estimates {{the value of the}} RCU as a weighted average of East Asian currencies according to the method used to calculate the ECU under the EMS. The basket feature of the RCU yields benefits and costs. First, the use of the RCU central rate can make the intervention burden of a central bank less onerous than the use of a bilateral exchange rate. Also, for any given band of margins, a basket unit offers more flexibility than a bilateral exchange rate. Another advantage of using the RCU is that the variance of RCU exchange rates is smaller than the variance of exchange rates of component countries. However, the usefulness of the RCU as a unit of account for domestic transactions and contracts will be very limited because of information costs and uncertainty about the value of the RCU. Also, theintroduction of the RCU raises the important problem of asymmetry for foreign exchange market intervention. Once such a problem is solved, the RCU can be then used as a <b>divergence</b> <b>indicator</b> to monitor the exchange rates of Asian currencies between themselves and against the US dollar or the euro. The creation of the RCU {{is a good way to}} coordinate policies and assure exchange stability between Asian countries.

With purely descriptive data, it is difficult to evaluate whether this pattern is a consequence of the rapid demise of asexual lineages, an unusual degree of mutational stability, or recombination.

The paper will show that each type of variance has a different interpretation as an error measure and that such arbitrary swapping merely masks the true problem. In the process, we will show that such variance <b>divergences</b> are true <b>indicators</b> of severe system or modeling problems that must be physically addressed, not ignored. The second myth is that one can use ensemble-based statistical estimation techniques like least squares and Kalman filters to properly estimate polynomial deterministic behavior in data containing non-highpass filtered neg-p noise. It is demonstrated that such noise can generate highly anomalous fitting results because non-highpass-filtered neg-p noise is both infinitely correlated and non-ergodic.

Specifically, it considers the impact of global shocks on the competitiveness of individual euro area countries and assesses whether their responses to such shocks have converged, as well as to what pattern. Technically, the paper applies a newly developed methodology based on infinite VAR theory featuring a dominant unit to a large set of over 60 countries' real effective exchange rates, including those of the individual euro area economies, and compares impulse response functions to the estimated systems before and after EMU with respect to three types of shocks: a global US dollar shock, generalised impulse response function shocks and a global shock to risk aversion. Our results show that the way euro area countries' real effective exchange rates adjust to these shocks has converged indeed, albeit to a pattern that depends crucially {{on the nature of the}} shock. This result is noteworthy given the apparent <b>divergence</b> in competitiveness <b>indicators</b> of these countries in the first ten years of EMU, which suggests that this diverging pattern is unlikely to be due to global external shocks with asymmetric effects but rather to other factors, such as country-specific domestic shocks.

40|$|This article aims to {{determine}} the convergence of the 27 EU Member States {{in the field of}} excise duties in the period 2000 â 2015. However, more recent complete data for all states are not available yet. The development trend towards convergence or <b>divergence</b> of monitored <b>indicators</b> is detected by indicators that represent excise taxes in the tax systems of the Member States of the European Union from the Eurostat database. Excise taxes are collected as whole. The article should answer two questions that are derived from generally preferred trends in the EU in a given period, ie. the trend growth of the tax burden to consumption and a trend approximation (harmonization) taxing consumption due to the functioning of internal market in the EU. The question is whether Member states and candidate countries are similar {{to each other in the}} field of excise duties and any similarity to the changes between the years 2000 and 2015. The second question is whether the differences are caused by tax policy states, ie. Changes in rates or absolute consumption. The indicators of individual member states are subjected to cluster analysis, and subsequently evaluated by means of selected factors that relate to tax policy and national economic aggregates, especially the consumption of taxed products. Results show growing differences (divergence) between most countries of the original EUâ 15 group and the group of countries which joined the European Union in 2004 and 2007...|$|R

The MACD-Histogram (MACDH) {{can be derived from}} MACD as a second-order trading signal of price actions. To reduce the lagging effects in MACD&MACDH, forecasted values are introduced in a hybrid trading signal, termed as the forecasted MACDH. A detailed trading simulation is performed for a single stock/commodity under a single long-short-MACD parameter of different timeframes of charts is taken into consideration to explain the experimental design. In the Stock Market, Commodity Market, Forex Market all over the World this concept of Histograms can be applied. MACD Histogram is actually a value that can be positive or negative according that value a bar is plotted on the MACD Technical Indicator. This MACD Histogram gives the answer to what will be the movement of the market in future and according to that the investor or trader can take decision on Buy/Sell or Long/Short. The Concept Data Mining is used to retrieve the data and values of previous and current Histograms. Data mining is a process used by companies to turn raw data into useful information. By using software to look for patterns in large batches of data, businesses can learn more about their customers and develop more effective marketing strategies as well as increase sales and decrease costs.

40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of bank risk {{is a matter}} of considerable importance for bank regulation and supervision. Current practices in most countries emphasize reliance on financial statement data for assessing banks 2 Ì 019 risk. However, the possibility of increased reliance on market-based risk indicators has been a topic for academic and regulatory debate for a long time. Market monitoring of bank risk has typically been tested by regressing market-based risk indicators on various benchmark indicators (such as accounting ratios and credit ratings) to detect whether the market tracks bank risk. This approach overlooks the methodological 2 Ì 018 unobservability 2 Ì 019 problem that testing one imperfect proxy indicator against another, when the true value (in this case, a bank 2 Ì 019 s 2 Ì 018 true 2 Ì 019 risk) is unknown, must yield limited conclusions as to the appropriateness of either indicator 2 Ì 013 particularly in the event of failure to establish a significant association. This paper assesses the relative information content of different risk indicators indirectly by associating the <b>divergence</b> between these <b>indicators</b> with the institutional setting. Empirical results for a large panel of banks worldwide suggest that market-based indicators are often more accurate than accounting indicators for high levels of institutional quality. In particular, spreads on subordinated debt may be more informative than either equity-based or accounting-based measures if the institutional conditions for market discipline to function are favourable. In addition, a combination measure incorporating both accounting and market data has superior accuracy regardless of the level of institutional quality, indicating that market data may contain complementary information on risk. These results cast doubt on the validity of the conclusions drawn in several previous studies that reject market discipline based on the finding that market-based risk indicators do not correspond well with various standard non-market indicators...|$|R

Para que fosse concebida, foi necessÃ¡rio identificar e descrever as divisÃµes importantes no processo de reforma econÃ´mica da RepÃºblica Popular da China; analisar o ambiente legal e regulamentar, bem como a evoluÃ§Ã£o da educaÃ§Ã£o e da profissÃ£o contÃ¡bil e sua influÃªncia na ediÃ§Ã£o de normas contÃ¡beis; identificar os principais Ã³rgÃ£os normatizadores da contabilidade e suas principais funÃ§Ãµes exercidas e comparar os padrÃµes locais e os internacionais, com a finalidade de verificar a harmonia dos resultados sob as normas contÃ¡beis da China e as internacionais editadas pelo IASB. Para efetuar a comparaÃ§Ã£o, foram utilizadas as reconciliaÃ§Ãµes do lucro lÃ­quido divulgado pelas empresas que tem aÃ§Ãµes do tipo B negociadas na Bolsa de Valores de Shenzhen, sendo obtidas as reconciliaÃ§Ãµes em conformidade com os padrÃµes internacionais de contabilidade editados pelo IASB. Assim, utilizou-se um indicador de conservadorismoâ que serviu de parÃ¢metro para comparabilidade dos resultados obtidos pelos padrÃµes locais e internacionais. Conforme verificado na comparaÃ§Ã£o de padrÃµes, as normas chinesas apresentam divergÃªncias quando comparadas aos padrÃµes do IASB. Entretanto, para confirmar estas divergÃªncias, o indicador de âconservadorismoâ ratificou ou nÃ£o a aderÃªncia da convergÃªncia Ã s normas internacionais. Este indicador mostrou que a amostra das empresas pesquisadas, quando utilizam as normas chinesas, resulta em um lucro mais conservador em relaÃ§Ã£o ao resultado reconciliado com os padrÃµes internacionais editados pelo IASB. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis {{research}} has as objective to evaluate degree of convergence between the accounting standards emitted by China and the International IASB's standards International Standard Accounting Board). For {{this to be}} conceived, {{it was necessary to}} identify and to describe the striking divisions that were important in the process of economic reform of Popular Republic of China; it was also necessary to analyze the legal and regular atmosphere, as well as the evolution of education and of the accounting profession and its influence in the edition of accounting standards; besides, it was necessary to identify the main normative accounting bodies and its main exercised functions; and was necessary to compare the local and international patterns with the purpose of verifying the harmony of the results under the China's accounting standards and the international ones published by IASB. The reconciliations of the net profit disclosed by companies that have type B stocks traded in the Shenzhen's stock exchange were used to make the comparison. The reconciliations in conformity with the international standards of accounting published by IASB were then obtained. Thus, it was used an indicator of "conservatism" that served as parameter for the comparability of the results obtained by the local and international patterns. As verified in the comparison of standards, the Chinese one present divergences when compared with IASB's patterns. However, to confirm these <b>divergences,</b> the <b>indicator</b> of "conservatism" ratified, or not, the adherence of the convergence to the international standards. This indicator showed that the sample of the researched companies, when adopted the Chinese norms, result in a more conservative profit in relation to the result reconciled with the international standards published by IASB...|$|R
40|$|Evolutionary {{algorithms}} {{consist of}} several heuristics {{able to solve}} optimization tasks by imitating some aspects of natural evolution. In the ï¬eld of computational ï¬nance, this type of procedures, combined with neural networks, swarm intelligence, fuzzy systems and machine learning has been successfully applied {{to a variety of}} problems, such as the prediction of stock price movements and the optimal allocation of funds in a portfolio. Nowadays, there is an increasing interest among computer scientists to solve these issues concurrently by deï¬ning automatic trading strategies based on artiï¬cial expert systems, technical analysis and fundamental and economic information. The objective is to develop procedures able, from one hand, to mimic the practitioners behavior and, from the other, to beat the market. In this sense, Fernandez-RodrÃ­guez et al. (2005) investigate the proï¬tability of the generalized moving average trading rule for the General Index of Madrid Stock Market by optimizing parameter values with a genetic algorithm. They conclude that the optimized trading rules are superior to a risk-adjusted buy-and-hold strategy if the transaction costs are reasonable. Similarly, Papadamou & Stephanides (2007) present the GATradeTool, a parameter optimization tool based on genetic algorithms for technical trading rules. In the description of this software, they compare it with other commonly used, non-adaptive tools in terms of stability of the returns and computational costs. Results of the tests on the historical data of a UBS fund show that GATradeTool outperforms the other tools. FernÃ¡ndez-Blanco et al. (2008) propose to use the moving average convergence <b>divergence</b> technical <b>indicator</b> to predict stock indices by optimizing its parameters with a genetic algorithm. Experimental results for the Dow Jones Industrial Average index conï¬rm the capability of evolutionary algorithms to improve technical indicators with respect to the classical conï¬gurations adopted by practitioners. An alternative approach to generate technical trading systems for stock timing that combines machine learning paradigms and a variable length string multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed in Kaucic (2010). The most informative technical indicators are selected by the genetic algorithm and combined into a unique trading signal by a learning method. A static single-position automated day trading strategy between the S&P 500 Composite Index and the 3 -months Treasury Bill is analyzed in three market phases, up-trend, down-trend and sideways-movements, covering the period 2000 - 2006. The results indicate that the near-optimal set of rules varies among market phases but presents stable results and is able to reduce or eliminate losses in down-trend periods. As a natural consequence of these studies, evolutionary algorithms may constitute a promising tool also for portfolio strategies involving more than two stocks. In the ï¬eld of portfolio selection, Markowitz and Sharpe models are frequently used as a task for genetic algorithm optimization. For instance, the problem of ï¬nding the efï¬cient frontier associated with the standard mean-variance portfolio is tackled by Chang et al. (2000). They extend the standard model to include cardinality and composition constraints by applying three heuristic algorithms based upon genetic algorithms, tabu search and simulated annealing. Computational results are presented for ï¬ve data sets involving up to 225 assets. Wilding (2003) proposes a hybrid procedure for portfolio management based on factor models, allowing constraints on the number of trades and securities. A genetic algorithm is responsible for selecting the best subset of securities that appears in the ï¬nal solution, while a quadratic programming routine determines the utility value for that subset. Experiments show the ability of this approach to generate portfolios highly able to track an index. The Î² â G genetic portfolio algorithm proposed by Oh et al. (2006) selects stocks based on their market capitalization and optimizes their weights in terms of portfolio Î²âs standard deviation. The performance of this procedure depends on market volatility and tends to register outstanding performance for short-term applications. The approach I consider for portfolio management {{is quite different from the}} previous models and is based on technical analysis. In general, portfolio optimizations using technical analysis are modular procedures where a module employs a set of rules based on technical indicators in order to classify the assets in the market, while another module concentrates on generating and managing portfolio over time (for a detailed presentation of the subject, the interested reader may refer to Jasemi et al. (2011)). An interesting application in this context is the approach developed by Korczak & Lipinski (2003) that leads to the optimization of portfolio structures by making use of artiï¬cial trading experts, previously discovered by a genetic algorithm (see Korczak & Roger (2002)), and evolutionary strategies. The approach has been tested using data from the Paris Stock Exchange. The proï¬ts obtained by this algorithm are higher than those of the buy-and-hold strategy. Recently, Ghandar et al. (2009) describe a two-modules interacting procedure where a genetic algorithm optimizes a set of fuzzy technical trading rules according to market conditions and interacts with a portfolio strategy based on stock ranking and cardinality constraints. They introduce several performance metrics to compare their portfolios with the Australian Stock Exchange index, showing greater returns and lower volatility. An alternative multi-modular approach has been developed by Gorgulho et al. (2011) that aims to manage a ï¬nancial portfolio by using technical analysis indicators optimized by a genetic algorithm. In order to validate the solutions, authors compare the designed strategy against the market itself, the buy-and-hold and a purely random strategy, under distinct market conditions. The results are promising since the approach outperforms the competitors. As the previous examples demonstrate, the technical module occupies, in general, a subordinate position relative to the management component. Since transaction costs, cardinality and composition constraints are of primary importance for the rebalancing purpose, the effective impact of technical signals in the development of optimal portfolios is not clear. To highlight the beneï¬ts of using technical analysis in portfolio management, I propose an alternative genetic optimization heuristic, based on an equally weighted zero investment strategy, where funds are equally divided among the stocks of a long portfolio and the stocks of a short one. Doing so, the trading signals directly inï¬uence the portfolio construction. Moreover, I implement three types of portfolio generation models according to the risk-adjusted measure considered as the objective, in order to study the relation between portfolio risk and market condition changes. The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 explains in detail the proposed method, focusing on the investment strategy, the deï¬nitions of the technical indicators and the evolutionary learning algorithm adopted. Section 3 presents the experimental results and discussions. Finally, Section 4 concludes the chapter with some remarks and ideas for future improvements...|$|R
