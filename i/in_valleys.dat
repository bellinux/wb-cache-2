5|$|Igneous {{activity}} {{associated with}} this stretching occurred from 12million to 4million years ago. Sedimentation is concentrated <b>in</b> <b>valleys</b> (basins) from material eroded from adjacent ranges. The amount of sediment deposited has roughly kept up with this subsidence, resulting in retention of {{more or less the}} same valley floor elevation over time.|$|E
5|$|All erosion types took {{advantage}} of preexisting weaknesses in the rock such as rock type, amount of lithification, {{and the presence of}} cracks or joints in the rock. Basalt flows concentrated <b>in</b> <b>valleys</b> but subsequent erosion removed sedimentary rock that once stood at higher elevations. The resulting inverted relief consists of ridges capped by basalt which are separated by adjacent drainages.|$|E
5|$|Eruptions {{would likely}} {{continue}} {{for a period}} of time, followed by years of decreasing secondary activity. The solidifying lava would occasionally collapse portions of the volcano to create pyroclastic flows. Rubble on the flanks of the volcano and <b>in</b> <b>valleys</b> would occasionally be released to form debris flows. Major construction would be needed to repair the community of Squamish and Highway 99.|$|E

5|$|The {{history and}} {{economic}} growth of Minneapolis are tied to water, the city's defining physical characteristic, which {{was brought to the}} region during the last ice age ten thousand years ago. Ice blocks deposited <b>in</b> <b>valleys</b> by retreating glaciers created the lakes of Minneapolis. Fed by a receding glacier and Lake Agassiz, torrents of water from a glacial river cut the Mississippi riverbed and created the river's only waterfall, Saint Anthony Falls, important to the early settlers of Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|At {{least five}} hot springs exist <b>in</b> <b>valleys</b> near Mount Cayley, {{providing}} more evidence for magmatic activity. This includes springs found at Shovelnose Creek and Turbid Creek {{on the southern}} flank of Mount Cayley and Brandywine Creek on the eastern flank of the volcanic field. They are generally found in areas of volcanic activity that are geologically young. As the regional surface water percolates downward through rocks below the Mount Cayley field, it reaches areas of high temperatures surrounding an active or recently solidified magma reservoir. Here, the water is heated, becomes less dense and rises {{back to the surface}} along fissures or cracks. These features are sometimes referred to as dying volcanoes because they seem to represent the last stage of volcanic activity as the magma at depth cools and hardens.|$|E
5|$|Geralda was {{the second}} cyclone in as many months to strike eastern Madagascar, after Daisy in January. Geralda {{produced}} wind gusts as strong as , which were the highest worldwide for several decades. The cyclone also dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding, particularly <b>in</b> <b>valleys.</b> About 80% {{of the city of}} Toamasina was destroyed, including most schools, homes, and churches. The cyclone heavily damaged roads and rail lines, which later disrupted relief efforts. In the capital Antananarivo, Geralda killed 43people after flooding many houses. Overall, more than 40,000homes were destroyed, leaving 356,000people homeless. Nationwide, the cyclone killed 231people and caused over $10million in damage (1994USD). Relief work in the storm's aftermath was hampered by lack of coordination, and the Malagasy military were deployed to help storm victims. Few stocks were pre-positioned, causing food prices to rise greatly. Several countries and departments of the United Nations donated money or supplies to the country.|$|E

5|$|Golden jackals are {{abundant}} <b>in</b> <b>valleys</b> and beside rivers and their tributaries, canals, lakes, and seashores. They are rare in foothills and low mountains, and they avoid waterless deserts and snow areas. The golden jackal {{is a social}} species, the basic social unit of which consists of a breeding pair and any young offspring. It is very adaptable, {{with the ability to}} exploit food ranging from fruit and insects to small ungulates. They will attack domestic fowl and domestic mammals up to the size of domestic water buffalo calves. The jackal's competitors are the red fox, wolf, jungle cat, forest wildcat, and the raccoon in the Caucasus, and the steppe wildcat in Central Asia. In Europe, jackals will not occupy the same areas as wolves, with the jackal's expansion being attributed to their occupying those areas where wolves are few or non-existent.|$|E
5|$|Mount Adams is the second-most isolated, {{in terms}} of access, {{stratovolcano}} in Washington; Glacier Peak is the most isolated. Only two major highways pass close to it. Highway 12 passes about 25 {{miles to the north}} of Adams through the Cascades. Highway 141 comes within 13 miles of Adams as it follows the White Salmon River valley up from the Columbia River to the small town of Trout Lake. From either highway, travelers have to use Forest Service roads to get closer to the mountain. The main access roads, FR 23, FR 82, FR 80, and FR 21, are paved for part of their length. Most all other roads are gravel or dirt, with varying degrees of maintenance. Access to the Mount Adams Recreation Area is by way of FR 82, which becomes BIA 285 at the Yakama reservation boundary. BIA 285 is known to be extremely rough and often suitable only for trucks or high-clearance vehicles. Two small towns, Glenwood and Trout Lake, are located <b>in</b> <b>valleys</b> less than 15 miles from the summit, Glenwood on the southeast quarter and Trout Lake on the southwest quarter.|$|E
5|$|The {{forest at}} Ambohimanga benefited from {{customary}} protection and today represents {{the largest of}} the last remaining fragments of primary forest that formerly covered the highlands. It contains a representative assortment of native tree and plant species, in particular the endemic tree zahana (phyllarthron madagascariensis) and a variety of indigenous medicinal plants, many possessing traditional or spiritual importance. Examples include the native bush Anthocleista, traditionally believed to attract lightning and often planted in clusters beside villages; the Dracaena plant, traditionally used for hedges and planted at sacred sites <b>in</b> <b>valleys</b> or other natural features where people would come to communicate with ancestral spirits; and the Phyllarthron vine, which was planted in sacred thickets and harvested for its wood, which was traditionally used to fashion handles for diverse tools. The recent and growing presence of two foreign species (golden bamboo and lantana) threaten the integrity of the site's ecosystem. The local management authority is currently engaged in activities to eradicate the encroaching vegetation.|$|E

5|$|The storm sent a {{plume of}} {{moisture}} throughout the Arabian Peninsula, contributing to dust storms {{as far north as}} Iraq. However, the effects were most severe in Yemen, becoming the second-worst natural disaster in the country after deadly floods in 1996. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in a normally arid region, reaching around , which caused flash flooding <b>in</b> <b>valleys</b> after waterways were unable to contain the approximately 2billionkm3 (528billion gallons) of water that fell. Poor drainage practices and an invasive species of weed contributed to the floods, which damaged or destroyed 6,505houses, leaving about 25,000people homeless. The floods killed 180people and severely disrupted the livelihoods of about 700,000residents of Hadhramaut and Al Mahrah governorates, mostly farmers whose fields were washed away. Some of the buildings at the Shibam UNESCO World Heritage Site collapsed due to the floods. Overall damage was estimated at US$874.8million, although residual losses from damaged infrastructure were estimated to cost an additional US$726.9million. The overall economic impact of the storm was therefore estimated at US$1.638billion, equating to roughly 6% of the country's gross domestic product.|$|E
25|$|The main {{vegetation}} {{formation of}} the Esperance Plains region is mallee-heath; this covers about 58% of the region. Other significant vegetation forms include mallee (17%), scrub-heath (13%) and coastal dune scrub (4%). There is very little woodland; the only woodland communities are some of Eucalyptus marginata (Jarrah), Corymbia calophylla (Marri) and E.wandoo (Wandoo) <b>in</b> <b>valleys</b> of the Stirling Range (1%); and some E.loxophleba (York Gum) and Eucalyptus occidentalis (Flat-topped Yate) woodland in low-lying areas. There is also {{a small amount of}} low forest on islands off the coast. 1.7% of the region is unvegetated.|$|E
25|$|The common {{mountain}} or {{forest pasture}} used for transhumance in summer is called seter or bod / bua. The same term {{is used for}} a related mountain cabin, which {{was used as a}} summer residence. In summer (usually late June), livestock is moved to a mountain farm, often quite distant from a home farm, in order to preserve meadows <b>in</b> <b>valleys</b> for producing hay. Livestock were typically tended for summer by girls and younger women, who also milked and made cheese. Bulls usually remained at the home farm. As autumn approached and grazing became in short supply, livestock are returned to a home farm.|$|E

25|$|During the Saalian Stage (230,000–130,000 years ago) {{the area}} of the present-day Lüneburg Heath was covered three times by a {{continental}} ice sheet. In the last glacial period (110,000–10,000 years ago) the ice sheet no longer covered the Lüneburg Heath area; it reached only as far as the River Elbe. Due to the lack of vegetation, the much more rugged terrain at that time was heavily eroded by water, wind and by soil fluction; this resulted <b>in</b> <b>valleys</b> like the Totengrund. The material displaced by erosion, referred to as sediment (Geschiebedecksand), has a depth of 0.4 to 0.8 metres (on slopes up to 1.5 metres).|$|E
25|$|The equator {{lies about}} 100 {{miles south of}} Kuching, and most of {{northern}} Borneo receives over 3000mm of rain each year. Borneo is naturally covered by tropical rainforest. This covers the mountainous areas cut by many rivers with very steep sided hills and hilltop ridges often only a few metres wide. The high rainfall means large rivers; these provide a main means of transport and are formidable tactical obstacles. Dense mangrove forest covering vast tidal flats intersected with numerous creeks is a feature of many coastal areas, including Brunei and {{either end of the}} border. There are cultivated areas <b>in</b> <b>valleys</b> and around villages. In the vicinity of abandoned and current settlements are areas of dense secondary regrowth.|$|E
25|$|Eruptive {{activity}} {{itself could}} continue for years, followed {{by years of}} decreasing secondary activity. Volcanic ash would most likely spread throughout the Pacific Northwest, causing airports to be closed and relevant flights to be diverted or cancelled. The associated ash column would then extend eastward by the prevailing winds and disrupt air traffic throughout Canada from Alberta to Newfoundland and Labrador. The cooling lava would discontinuously spall units to create pyroclastic flows (super-heated mix of gas, ash, and pumice). The loose volcanic rock and pyroclastic material on Cayley's flanks and <b>in</b> <b>valleys</b> would be periodically reactivated into debris flows. Considerable structural improvements {{would have to be}} made to reclaim use of Highway 99 and Squamish area.|$|E

25|$|Malaitan {{hydrology}} includes {{thousands of}} small springs, rivulets, and streams, characteristic of a young drainage pattern. At higher altitudes waterfalls are common, and in some places canyons have been cut through the limestone. Nearer the coasts, rivers are slower and deeper, and form mangrove swamps of brackish water, along with alluvial deposits of gravel, sand, or mud. The coastal plain is very narrow. Inland soils are of three types, wet black, dry black, and red. The wet black soil, too poorly drained for most horticulture except taro, is found <b>in</b> <b>valleys</b> or {{at the foot of}} slopes. Dry black makes the best gardening sites. The red soil, probably laterite, does not absorb runoff and forms a hard crust, and is preferred for settlement sites.|$|E
25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the redevelopment plan, Marshall Heights residents began to demand in August 1949 that the freeze on improvements be lifted. City officials refused, arguing that with half of all homes in the neighborhood facing condemnation for safety reasons, redevelopment was the only option. The city also argued that it would be too expensive to build water and sewer lines along the existing street plan, and that residents would be unable to afford the hookup and frontage fees. In September 1949, District engineers staked out sewer, water, and natural gas lines along two streets in Marshall Heights to demonstrate the difficulties in construction and prove how costly the effect would be to residents. From this example, the city claimed that laying water and sewer lines in Marshall Heights would cost $1.2 million more than in any other neighborhood, and said that razing all the homes in the area, realigning streets around hills, regrading streets, and filling <b>in</b> <b>valleys</b> was the only feasible and cost-effective option.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} hot springs {{adjacent}} to the Lillooet River valley, such as the Harrison, Sloquet, Clear Creek and Skookumchuck springs, are not known to occur near areas with recent volcanic activity. Instead, many are located near 16–26million year old intrusions of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt. The relationship of these hot springs to the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is not clear. However, a few hot springs are known to exist in areas that have experienced relatively recent volcanic activity. About five hot springs exist <b>in</b> <b>valleys</b> near Mount Cayley and two small groups of hot springs are present at Mount Meager. The springs at Meager might be evidence of a shallow magma chamber beneath the surface. No hot springs are known to exist at Mount Garibaldi like those found at Mount Meager and Mount Cayley, although {{there is evidence of}} abnormal high heat flow at the adjacent Table Meadows and other locations. Abnormal warm water adjacent to Britannia Beach could be geothermal activity linked to the Watts Point volcanic centre.|$|E
