5|$|Prerogative {{powers were}} {{formerly}} exercised by the monarch acting on <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> initiative. Since the 19th century, by convention, {{the advice of}} the prime minister or the cabinet—who are then accountable to Parliament for the decision—has been required in order for the prerogative to be exercised. The monarch remains constitutionally empowered to exercise the royal prerogative against {{the advice of the}} prime minister or the cabinet, but in practice would only do so in emergencies or where existing precedent does not adequately apply to the circumstances in question.|$|E

5|$|The MSE {{derives from}} an {{approach}} to psychiatry known as descriptive psychopathology or descriptive phenomenology, which developed {{from the work of}} the philosopher and psychiatrist Karl Jaspers. From Jaspers' perspective it was assumed {{that the only way to}} comprehend a patient's experience is through <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> description (through an approach of empathic and non-theoretical enquiry), as distinct from an interpretive or psychoanalytic approach which assumes the analyst might understand experiences or processes of which the patient is unaware, such as defense mechanisms or unconscious drives.|$|E

I liked the satirical but warmly affectionate eye with which Garson sees every character and the show's tenderly complex relationships. I like that Garson is not chary with ideas because she is writing for kids." ...|$|R

A full meeting of the Privy Council was also held on 6 February 1811, when George, Prince of Wales was sworn in as Prince Regent by Act of Parliament. The current statutes regulating the establishment of a regency in the case of minority or incapacity of the sovereign also require any regents to swear their oaths before the Privy Council.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, a {{year after}} independence, slaves made up 29% of the {{population}} of Brazil, a figure which fell throughout the lifetime of the Empire: from 24% in 1854, to 15.2% in 1872, and finally to less than 5% in 1887—the year before slavery was completely abolished. Slaves were mostly adult males from southwestern Africa. Slaves brought to Brazil differed ethnically, religiously and linguistically, each identifying primarily with <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> nation of origin, rather than by a shared African ethnicity. Some of the slaves brought to the Americas had been captured while fighting intertribal wars in Africa and had then been sold to slave dealers.|$|E

5|$|Mario & Sonic brings {{together}} the two title characters and fourteen more from both franchises {{to participate in}} environments based on the official venues of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. These environments are stylized to fit the futuristic and cartoon-like art styles of the Sonic and Mario franchises respectively. Each playable character has <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> statistics which can serve as an advantage or disadvantage depending on the event. The characters are divided into four categories: all-around, speed, power, and skill. The Wii version has additional in-game characters taken from the console's Mii Channel, which allows the user to create a Mii, a customized avatar, that can be imported into games that support the feature. Both games have non-playable characters who serve as referees for particular events.|$|E
5|$|People {{relive the}} Wild West both {{historically}} and {{in popular culture}} by participating in cowboy action shooting events, where each gunslinger adopts <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> look representing a character from Western life in the late 1800s, {{and as part of}} that character, chooses an alias to go by. The sport originated in Southern California, USA, in the early 1980s but is now practiced in many places with several sanctioning organizations including the Single Action Shooting Society (SASS), Western Action Shootists Association (WASA), and National Congress of Old West Shooters (NCOWS), as well as others in the USA and in other countries. There are different categories shooters can compete in. There's the gunfighter, frontiersman, classic cowboy and duelist - each with its own specifications.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{a survey}} among colleagues, we {{observed}} that few surgical trainees are aware of this opportunity {{and that they do}} not realize that this budget-friendly training simulator is easily accessible. These guidelines allow any surgical trainee to build <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> very <b>own</b> laparoscopic training model in a mere 30  min. This allows for practice at home or at the hospital during free hours and gaining more technical experience [5]. Therefore, both staff members and assistants benefit from this additional training opportunity. The possible exercises are as extensive as with professional equipment and include among others hand-eye coordination in 2 D view, laparoscopic suturing, and knotting. The lack of exercising camera navigation is a shortcoming; however, this is readily learned in the OR, being the main job of the assistant as of his first year.|$|R
6000|$|But Miss Pinnegar was too angry to be philosophic. Alvina knew it {{was useless}} to be either angry or {{otherwise}} emotional.

[...] "Answer or die," [...] said the Sphinx of fate. Miss Pinnegar could answer <b>her</b> <b>own</b> fate according to its question. She could say [...] "haberdashery shop," [...] and her sphinx would recognize this answer as true to nature, and would be satisfied. But every individual has <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> fate, and <b>her</b> <b>own</b> sphinx. Alvina's sphinx was an old, deep thoroughbred, she would take no mongrel answers. And her thoroughbred teeth were long and sharp. To Alvina, the last of the fantastic but pure-bred race of Houghton, the problem of her fate was terribly abstruse.|$|R
5|$|The Ministry of Justice {{was headed}} by a Minister who was elected by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet between seasons, and {{authenticated}} by a Supreme Soviet convocation. Deputy Ministers were elected by the Council of Ministers; allocation of the deputies was decided by the Ministry of Justice. Each deputy usually headed <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> department. The minister, the deputies, and other senior officials formed the leadership circle, known as the Board of the Ministry of Justice. The members of this board were approved by the Council of Ministers. The Board of the Ministry held meetings regularly to discuss legal matters nationwide. Decisions made by the board were as a rule implemented nationwide. If the board disagreed they sought {{the assistance of the}} Council of Ministers to solve the problem.|$|E

5|$|The accompaniment for a Peking opera {{performance}} usually {{consists of}} a small ensemble of traditional melodic and percussion instruments. The lead melodic instrument is the jinghu, a small, high-pitched, two-string spike fiddle. The jinghu is the primary accompaniment for performers during songs. Accompaniment is heterophonic – the jinghu player follows the basic contours of the song's melody, but diverges in pitch and other elements. The jinghu often plays more notes per measure than the performer sings, and does so an octave lower. During rehearsal, the jinghu player adopts <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> signature version of the song's melody, but also must adapt to spontaneous improvisations {{on the part of}} the performer due to changed performance conditions. Thus, the jinghu player must have an instinctive ability to change his or her performance without warning to properly accompany the performer.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a strange}} state of things, with all those {{different}} pairs of confidential friends. Both Marian and Walter were the stay and support of Caroline and Lionel; yet, though acting in concert, and perfectly agreed, not saying a word in confidence {{to each other on}} either head. Neither did Walter speak of Caroline to Lionel, nor Lionel, though much interested for her, speak to <b>her</b> of <b>his</b> affairs <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own.</b> Clara indeed bestowed her communications on every one, but she got nothing in return that was satisfactory. Marian was the central point with all except Walter, but the fulness of her heart was bestowed elsewhere. And, alas! none saw so little of those young hearts as the parents, who had never earned their confidence; so that when they turn to them, it was from duty, as to rulers, not as to counsellors and friends.|$|R

It was a magnificent self-assertion {{on the part of both}} of them, he asserted himself before her, he felt himself infinitely male and infinitely irresistible, she asserted herself before him, she knew herself infinitely desirable, and hence infinitely strong. And after all, what could either of them get from such a passion but a sense of <b>his</b> <b>or</b> of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> maximum self, in contradistinction to all the rest of life? Wherein was something finite and sad, for the human soul at its maximum wants a sense of the infinite.|$|R

5|$|In the Republic of India, a {{governor}} is the constitutional head {{of each of}} the twenty-nine states. The governor is appointed by the President of India for a term of five years, and holds office at the President's pleasure. The governor is de jure head of the state government; all its executive actions are taken in the governor's name. However, the governor must act on the advice of the popularly elected council of ministers, headed by the chief minister, who thus hold de facto executive authority at the state-level. The Constitution of India also empowers the governor to act upon <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> discretion, such as the ability to appoint or dismiss a ministry, recommend President's rule, or reserve bills for the President's assent. Over the years, the exercise of these discretionary powers have given rise to conflict between the elected chief minister and the central government–appointed governor.|$|E
60|$|It {{was quite}} true {{that a man}} {{concerned}} in a failure was in great danger of being {{left out of the}} race for employment, and Mr. Dutton did not think it needful to mention the force of the arguments he was using to back his recommendation of Mark Egremont. The possibilities he had heard of were a clerkship at a shipping agent's, another at a warehouse in their own line, and a desk at an insurance office. This sounded best, but had the smallest salary to begin with, and locality had to be taken into account. Mr. Dutton's plan was, that as soon as Mark was no longer necessary for what Annaple was pleased to call the fall of the sere and withered leaf, the pair should come to stay with him, so that Mark could see his possible employers, and Annaple consider of the situations. They accepted this gratefully, Mark only proposing that she should go either to <b>his</b> stepmother <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> relations to avoid the final crisis.|$|R
40|$|Theatre, at its core, is {{inherently}} an inquisition into {{human nature and}} life itself.

A writer uses <b>his,</b> <b>her,</b> <b>or</b> their <b>own</b> psyche’s ether to precipitate a physical manifestation of emotion, experience, and memory.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} a new approach to a content creation and delivery mechanism for a programming course. This approach is based on the concept of creating a large repository of learning objects, each of which consists of the core material, code examples, supplementary notes, and review questions. A learning object will be uniquely described by a XML document and presents an interface for future search, retrieval and updating, as well as for potential connection to external assessment tools. Furthermore, we describe a new teaching, learning and authoring tool (called Adaptive Book) that will allow users to add new learning objects, modify current ones, and discuss concepts using a variety of representation models. With the adaptive book, an instructor will be able to design <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> very <b>own</b> course using a large repository of material, which will target a particular audience or a customized syllabus. In addition, the electronic adaptive book will serve as an interactive, continuously up-to-date learning environment for students. It will allow students to create personal learning profiles that are embedded into the core content of the course. We believe that in the near future, this electronic adaptive book will have the potential to replace or enhance traditional paper textbooks. In all physicality, it is impossible to have a personal instructor for each student, but with the adaptive book, we believe we are one step closer to realizing the dream of individualized instructions for each and every student...|$|R
