The {{production}} of the song was handled by Jerkins, Beyoncé, Rowland and Garrett. Record producer Jerkins, who had previously collaborated with the group for [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), had worked on [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] without informing Destiny's Child. Beyoncé and Williams heard the drum instrumentation of the track and they enjoyed it with the latter feeling that the song was nothing like the mainstream radio sound. They went to their band mate Kelly Rowland presenting the song. Alongside Jerkins, the group asked for help from American rapper Jay-Z who immediately created a chorus including the lines [...] "Can you keep up" [...] without hearing the track. The group took his chorus and wrote the verses and bridge around it. During an interview with Complex, Garrett recalled the time he worked with Williams on the song, saying, [...] "There was so much magic {{going on in the}} studio. We probably recorded all the songs in about a month and every day it was a new song coming out. 'Lose My Breath' was towards {{the latter part of the}} album and that was an amazing song that we felt could not only be big on the radio but big with bands and marching bands. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> natural high after that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} late 1994, and proceeded midway through 1995 in RZA's basement studio in Staten Island, the same studio {{that many of}} the group's earlier albums were recorded in. In regard to Raekwon and Ghostface Killah's original recording intentions, RZA recounted [...] "They had wanted to go to Barbados. But when they got to Barbados, the racism was so crazy. It was on some slave mentality. The Blacks was being treated like shit. They stopped back, and everything was recorded in my basement. No engineer, no assistant engineer. I did everything on that shit. The only two albums I did with nobody fucking with me was Linx and Liquid Swords. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> mission. To make all those early albums took {{three and a half years}} of my life. I didn't come outside, didn't have too many girl relations, didn't even enjoy the shit. I just stayed in the basement. Hours and hours and days and days. Turkey burgers and blunts. I didn't know if it was working. But nobody could hear or say nothing, no comments, no touching the board when I leave. Everything was just how I wanted it." [...] Regarding the recording atmosphere, Raekwon stated [...] "The way RZA had it poppin' back then, we would come into his spot. It was like dudes would come in on their own time and create stuff. I remember I just came in, and the beats was just pumpin'." ...|$|E

40|$|In vitro {{experiments}} on anti-intrinsic factor antibodies in the sera from patients with pernicious anaemia are reported. These {{studies show that}} antibody activity which blocks the binding of B 12 by intrinsic factor (antibody <b>I)</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> different molecule from that which unites with intrinsic factor-B 12 (antibody II), and that antibody II unites with either intrinsic factor (IF) or intrinsic factor-B 12 (IFB 12). Antibody I exchanges readily with the B 12 of IFB 12. The complex of IF and antibody I will absorb antibody II. The data are interpreted as supporting the conclusion that IF has at least two antigenic regions. An unusual type of antibody activity is also reported. This antibody appears to stabilize B 12 on IF, so that exchange of B 1259 Co or antibody I with the B 1257 Co of IFB 1257 Co is inhibited. This antibody also forms a complex with IFB 12 which is of a different size from other antibody II–IFB 12 complexes...|$|R
