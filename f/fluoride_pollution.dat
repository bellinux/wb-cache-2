50|$|Most people {{associate}} fluoride {{with the}} practice of intentionally adding fluoride to public drinking-water supplies {{for the prevention of}} tooth decay. However, fluoride can also enter public water systems from natural sources, including runoff from weathering of fluoride-containing rocks and soils and leaching from soil into groundwater. <b>Fluoride</b> <b>pollution</b> from various industrial emissions can also contaminate water supplies. In a few areas of the United States, fluoride concentrations in water are much higher than normal, mostly from natural sources. In 1986, EPA established a maximum allowable concentration for fluoride in drinking water of 4 milligrams per liter (mg/L). After reviewing research on various health effects from exposure to fluoride, the Committee on Fluoride in Drinking Water of the National Research Council concluded in 2006 that EPA's drinking water standard for fluoride does not protect against adverse health effects. Just over 200,000 Americans live in communities where fluoride levels in drinking water are 4 mg/L or higher. Children in those communities are at risk of developing severe tooth enamel fluorosis, a condition that can cause tooth enamel loss and pitting. It can also increase the risk of bone fractures. The report concluded unanimously that the present maximum contaminant level goal of 4 mg/L for fluoride should be lowered.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} concentrations of fluorides in the environment, several bioindication methods for assessing the impact of <b>fluoride</b> <b>pollution</b> on living organisms have been developed {{in the last few}} decades. Studies of the exposure and impact of fluorides on mammals (primarily ungulates) are performed either as different methods of accumulative bioindication (i. e. determination of fluoride levels in bones, e. g. mandibles) and/or as methods of response bioindication (e. g. macroscopic assessment of the presence and severity of dental fluorosis as a specific morphologic change, which is the consequence of fluorides affecting the formation and development of the enamelin the time of tooth formation). Suitability of ungulates (particularly roe deer) mandibles as a perfect biomonitoring tool for assessingthe <b>fluoride</b> <b>pollution</b> has often been confirmed by the determination of strong positive correlations between fluoride concentrations in the environment and: (i) fluoride levels in mandibles of red/roe deer; (ii) severity of dental fluorosis in both deer species. A high potential of roe deer mandibles for bioindication purposes is stimulated by the fact that lower jaws of ungulates are often (in Slovenia they even must be) systematically collected with the purpose of cognitive management and control. Therefore, huge numbers of mandibles are available in Europe, equipped with all the needed individual (e. g. age, sex, health status) and geographical data (culling location).

The main genetic variability parameters of the two populations from Central Yakutia, a region free of <b>fluoride</b> <b>pollution,</b> had considerably higher values than those from East Transbaikalia, a region potentially affected by <b>fluoride</b> <b>pollution</b> (FLU, near a fluorite quarry growing on soils with a high natural content of fluorides).

The genetic diversity of the FLU fluoride-tolerant population was the lowest, but only slightly lower than that of a fluoride non-tolerant population from Chita, 50 km distant from FLU. Although this study demonstrates the absence of fundamental alterations of genetic structure within the populations of L. gmelinii growing on soils with a high content of fluorides, it is presumed that the reduction of genetic diversity was the genetic response of the FLU population to such an environmental stress as a constantly high concentration of fluorides within the soil...|$|E

To elucidate the source of F− and simulate the water–rock interaction processes, as well as quantify its distribution within different grain sizes, the pyroclastic ash was analysed by XRF, XRD and SEM and separated into coarse and fine fractions. Three columns were filled with raw (unsieved), coarse (63 μm– 2 mm) and fine (< 63 μm) fraction, respectively, and flushed with synthetic rain water in saturated conditions. Very fast F− leaching was observed in the fine fraction column {{at the start of the}} experiment, while in the other two columns, F− was slowly released; in addition, a strong accumulation of F− was found in the fine fraction.

Finally, flow and transport modelling (MODFLOW- 2000 and MT 3 DMS) was employed to compute the amount of F− adsorbed onto the solid phase, comparing the calculated conservative transport of F− and the observed concentrations.

In between several defluoridation techniques discovered so far, the adsorption process proved to be most economic and efficient. This study is an effort to evaluate defluoridation efficiency of powdered rice husk, fine chopped rice husk and sawdust by the batch adsorption process. Optimum defluoridation capacity is achieved by optimizing various parameters, viz. dose of adsorbent, pH, contact time and initial concentration. It was found that all three materials can be employed for the defluoridation technique, but powdered rice husk is the best adsorbent {{in the midst of all}} three. Powdered rice husk showed fluoride removal efficiency ranging between 85 and 90  % in the contact period of 7  h only in conditions of all optimized parameter. Following this parameter optimization, adsorption efficiency was also evaluated at natural pH of groundwater to minimize the cost of defluoridation. No significant difference was found between fluoride adsorption at optimized pH (pH =  4) and natural one (pH =  7), which concludes that powdered rice husk can be efficiently used for the defluoridation technique at field scale. The adsorption isotherm using this adsorbent perfectly followed Langmuir isotherms. The value of calculated separation factor also suggests the favourable adsorption of fluoride onto this adsorbent under the conditions used for the experiments.

30|$|<b>Fluoride</b> <b>pollution</b> in {{groundwater}} is {{a global}} concern as ingestion of water with fluoride concentration more than 1.5  mg/L may result in dental or skeletal fluorosis and, in the recent past, the defluoridation from groundwater {{has become a major}} thrust area of investigation for the scientific community. There are many defluoridation techniques available in the market such as adsorption (using both natural and artificial adsorbent), reverse osmosis, electrodialysis, ion exchange and membrane filtration. The economic feasibility of different methods has still not been evaluated. This work is an attempt to evaluate the defluoridation efficiency using three newly introduced materials (powdered rice husk, finely chopped rice husk and sawdust) as natural adsorbent based on their availability and economic feasibility. It was found that all the three materials have the property to adsorb the fluoride from groundwater, but the powdered rice husk was most efficient for keeping the optimized value of the dose of the adsorbent and contact time. The pH {{is also one of the}} main factors controlling the adsorption process and the present study compared the performance for different pH values, i.e. optimized pH and natural pH of the groundwater, as adjustment of pH will not be possible in villages. It is found that powdered rice husk can be efficiently applicable for defluoridation with the natural pH of groundwater at the field scale. The sorption of fluoride using this adsorbent followed Langmuir isotherms. Finally, for checking the feasibility of powdered rice husk in removing the fluoride from groundwater samples collected from Mehsana District, it was found that it lowers the concentration of fluoride to permissible limit in most of the samples. Thus, it can be concluded that rice husk can be used as a good adsorbent for removing the fluoride from groundwater in those area where its contamination is common.|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric aerosol {{particle}} {{samples were collected}} using an Ambient Eight Stage (Non-Viable) Cascade Impactor Sampler in a typical urban area of Beijing from 27 th Sep. to 5 th Oct., 2009. The surface chemistry of these {{aerosol particle}}s was analyzed using Static Time of Flight-Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (Static TOF-SIMS). The factors influencing surface compositions were evaluated {{in conjunction with the}} air pollution levels, meteorological factors, and air mass transport for the sampling period. The results show that a variety of organic ion groups and inorganic ions/ion groups were accumulated on the surfaces of aerosol particles in urban areas of Beijing; and hydrophobic organic compounds with short- or middle-chain alkyl as well as hydrophilic secondary inorganic compounds were observed. All these Compounds have the potential to affect the atmospheric behavior of urban aerosol particles. PM 1. 1 - 2. 1. and PM 3. 3 - 47 had similar elements on their surfaces, but some molecules and ionic groups demonstrated differences in Time of Flight-Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry spectra. This suggests that the quantities of elements varied between PM 1. 1 - 2. 1 and PM 3. 3 - 4. 7. In particular, more intense research efforts into <b>fluoride</b> <b>pollution</b> are required, because the fluorides on aerosol surfaces have the potential to harm human health. The levels of air pollution had the most significant influence on the surface compositions of aerosol particles in our study. Hence, heavier air pollution was associated with more complex surface compositions on aerosol particles. In addition, wind, rainfall, and air masses from the south also greatly influenced the surface compositions of these urban aerosol particles.

40|$|Baseline {{data for}} the first year of a two-year study to assess the current status of ponderosa pine stands in southeastern Montana {{relative}} to coal-fired electric power development are presented. Sixteen permanent plots in pine stands were established in eastern Montana, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Several characteristics believed to be sensitive to future sulfur dioxide and <b>fluoride</b> <b>pollution</b> from the power complex were measured on ten trees from each site. Average fluoride concentration in foliage was 1. 48 parts per million (ppm), and total sulfur was 483 ppm. Total chlorophyll was. 657 mg/gm (fresh wt.) in current needles,. 930 mg/gm in year-old needles, 1. 016 mg/gm in 2 -year old needles, and 1. 016 mg/gm in 3 -year old foliage. Average foliar water content was 48. 9 percent, and mean needle length was 125. 3 mm. Needle retention varied between 97 - 84 percent, depending on internode age. Average fascicular cross-sectional area was 2. 1 sq. mm. A number of different insects, fungi, and abiotic factors contributed to slight yellowing and browning of needles, including elegans pine weevil, basal side, various defoliators, and weather factors. Average total necrosis (tissue death) due to the sum of all these factors was less than 7 percent. Measurements of airborne reactive sulfur and fluoride by static plate techniques were negative. This, combined with the very low foliar concentration of sulfur and fluoride, establish the study area as virtually pollution free as of 1975. Additionally, comparisons between the baseline study area and known polluted sites throughout the United States indicate that the polluted sites differ significantly in regard to then pine characteristics measured, and that the degraded pine conditions in the polluted areas are due to airborne sulfur and fluoride concentrations similar to those expected in the near future from the Colstrip power generating facilities. It is anticipated that the ponderosa pine in the study area will be affected. This baseline study will be a convenient, if not necessary, document with which to compare future data in order to detect pollution insults on the pine forests in southeastern Montana...|$|E
40|$|Fluoride {{contamination}} in groundwater {{has been recognized}} as one of the serious problems for water quality worldwide, and it is classified as one of the contaminants of water for human consumption by the World Health Organization (WHO). Besides the natural geological sources of fluoride enrichment in groundwater, fluoride-containing minerals are used in several industries which contribute to <b>fluoride</b> <b>pollution.</b> The effluents of these industries have fluoride concentrations extending from ten to thousands of mg·L- 1. The WHO has established that acceptable F- concentration in water should be < 1. 5 mg·L- 1. Depending on the concentration and the consumption lasted of water with fluoride excess the effects can be very harmful for health. Nowadays many methods exist to remove fluoride from wastewater, such as adsorption, precipitation, electrocuagulation or ion-exchange. Adsorption shows considerable potential for fluoride removal from contaminated water, offering strategic advantages when compared to other techniques. Improvement of well-designed adsorbents is therefore of a great importance to the effective application of adsorption in water remediation. A wide variety of materials has been developed and used for fluoride removal from wastewater. However, the lowest limit achieved for fluoride removal with most adsorbents is greater than 2 mg·L- 1. Nanomaterials can offer several advantages in waste water treatments over traditional methods, such as high surface area and a short diffusion route. The high surface in relation to their volume offers the opportunity to treat contaminated water using nanoparticles instead of using large scale solid: therefore nanomaterials are expected to give better results than traditional sorbents (higher loading, lower residual concentration) with the advantage of cost and materials savings. Preliminary studies have shown that alumina has high affinity for fluoride and that mesoporous alumina has high adsorption efficiency. The scope of this work is to perform a thermodynamic study to characterize fluoride adsorption process on nano-alumina and screen the synthesized materials to obtain an optimal candidate for applications. We synthesized and characterized mesoporous alumina nanoparticles by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and then carried out adsorption studies. Fluoride adsorption has been investigated using a combined experimental approach which includes potentiometry (using a F- selective electrode) and, for the first time in this field, isothermal titration calorimetry. In our method, potentiometric data have been fitted with a Langmuir isotherm to obtain the value of Kads. Then, the Kads has been used to calculate the free F- concentration for each titrant addition in the calorimetric titrations in order to fit the experimental heat and ultimately obtain the Hads value for the fluoride adsorption...|$|E
40|$|The {{release of}} {{fluoride}} from {{the production of}} aluminium, and the subsequent impacts of deposition in the environment, is well documented (Weinstein and Davison, 2004). However, changes are occurring within the industry, driven by technological advances and growth in global manufacture, which {{have the potential to}} alter the impact of the aluminium industry on the environment. There needs to be {{a better understanding of the}} toxicity of Sodium hexafluoroaluminate (cryolite, Na 3 AlF 6), the impact of modern operating procedures on the release of particulates in to the environment, and finally, an investigation of the longevity of fluoride concentrations in vegetation from industrial pollution once emissions cease (EU, 2008). The toxicity of cryolite exposure to 1 st and 3 rd instar Diamondback moth larvae (Plutella xylostella (L), Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) was studied through a series of bioassays. There were inter-stage variations in both the lethal and sub-lethal responses to cryolite, whereby low mortality corresponded with high sub-lethal effects and vice versa. A dose-related response threshold was observed in both instars indicating that the physical nature of cryolite plays a role in the toxic mode of action. The comparative toxicity of cryolite from the pot-rooms of Lynemouth smelter and pesticide Kryocide© (Cerexagri, Inc) was investigated along with the role of particle size and the purity of the cryolite particulate in the mode of action. Although both physical and chemical factors played a role in toxicity, these factors formed a hierarchy and the mode of action had a significantly over-riding chemical grounding. Dust samples were collected from the vicinity of Lynemouth smelter for a period of 10 months in order to quantify the impact of modern aluminium production on the environment. Although the volumes of dust collected at any one site were lower than the European Community Short Term Ambient Guideline Concentration of Particulate Matter, dust deposition corresponded with aluminium production rates at the smelter showing that, despite Better Available Technology at the smelter, modern aluminium production still impacts on the environment. When Anglesey Aluminium Metals Ltd ended its operations in September 2009, it created a unique opportunity to assess the long-term impacts of <b>fluoride</b> <b>pollution</b> on the environment. Samples of soil, leaves and lichens were collected to monitor the changes in fluoride content over a 15 month period. The results showed that fluoride contamination of vegetation from industrial processes had a short-term impact once emissions ceased and that mineral-based soils had limited potential as contaminating sources for plant uptake. The mode of action of cryolite toxicity and the impact of waste disposal and fugitive release of cryolite in to the environment are discussed.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Waste {{products}} from industry {{have often been}} disposed in landfills without regard for any beneficial uses of the product in agricultural production. This research was conducted {{to determine the effect}} of a refractory metal processing waste product on (a) soil chemical and physical properties, (b) perennial ryegrass forage quality and seed yield, and (c) percolation water quality. Refractory metals processing waste was applied either as a slurry or dried to Dayton silty clay loam (sicl) at rates of 0, 5, 10, 25, and 50 tons/acre. Ammonium nitrate, concentrated superphosphate, muriate of potash, calcium sulfate, and lime were added to optimize plant growth. Lime, gypsum, and phosphorus fertilizer variables were incorporated into the study to investigate specific beneficial or problems areas associated with the waste product. The waste and fertilizers were tilled into the soil, and all plots seeded with perennial ryegrass (var. Linn) and irrigated. Elements found in the waste in excess of one percent included: Zr, Ca, F, Fe, Al, S, and C (as CO₃). Those elements found in concentrations ranging between 0. 1 and 1. 0 percent included: Hf, Mg, Na, Pb, P, NH₄-N, and K. The concentration of Cd, Ci, Co, Cr, Ni, Mn, and Mo were less than 1000 ppm. Soil pH, soluble salts, extractable Ca, Mg, NH₄-N, Zn, Ni, S, and F and the total Zr, Hf, and Pb content of the soil increased with waste application, while extractable Fe, Mn, and P levels decreased with waste application. Extractable Na, K, NO₃-N, Al, and Cu levels were not affected by waste application. The soluble salt content decreased from greater than 4. 0 mmhos /cm in the fall to less than 1. 7 mmnos /cm in the spring. The extractable Mg, Na, K, NH₄, NO₃, P, S, and Zn also decreased in the spring as compared to the fall levels. Acid extractable P levels were less than the minimum required for optimum crop production, 30 ppm. Iron, Mn, and Ni availability increased with time, due to the wet, reduced soil conditions present between sampling periods. Water percolation through the Dayton sicl soil increased with waste application, but soil moisture retention was not changed. Perennial ryegrass dry matter yields were not significantly changed by waste product additions, and were similar to yields obtained in commercial farm operations. Mean yields ranged from 2. 6 to 3. 3 tons/acre on the soils treated with dry waste, and 2. 8 to 4. 0 tons/acre on soils treated with the waste slurry. Clean seed yields were slightly less than normal, ranging from 754 to 1238 lbs /acre. The subnormal seed yields were probably due to seed loss during harvesting and cleaning. The waste additions did not affect seed viability. The Ca, Mg, K, P. Fe, Al, Mn, Cr, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Mo, F, Zr, Hf, and Pb contents of the perennial ryegrass were not significantly affected by waste application. The S, Na, and N uptake by the ryegrass increased at application rates of 50 ton/acre, compared to control plots, which indicated that the waste product may serve as a N and S fertilizer. Plant P levels were not significantly depressed by waste application, despite decreases in acid available P levels. Addition of 100 lbs P /acre did not significantly improve P uptake compared to soil treated with 25 lbs P/acre and similar amounts of waste. Ryegrass grown on soil that received no lime or waste showed significant reductions in uptake of Ca and Mo, compared to control plots. The addition of waste, 25 ton/acre, eliminated these reductions. The application of the waste product to the soil may pose a threat of <b>fluoride</b> <b>pollution</b> to groundwaters which would require special management practices. No other elemental hazards to groundwater were suggested. Utilization of refractory metals processing waste on Dayton sicl appears to be a viable waste disposal alternative, providing that further study establishes that F does not pose a threat to groundwaters under field conditions...|$|E
