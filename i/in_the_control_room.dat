5|$|During the Second World War the {{basement}} was converted into an air-raid shelter and an extension {{built in the}} yard to provide more space <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>room.</b> The fire services were nationalised in 1941, and London Road became the headquarters of Division C. In recognition of the fire fighters' efforts King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the fire station in 1942.|$|E
5|$|As the Mysterons {{start to}} fire on Cloudbase, Dr Fawn is killed. Posing as his assistant, Mysteron {{intermediary}} Captain Black reports that Scarlet is dead with {{no possibility of}} recovery, his retro-metabolic ability being too weak to heal such extensive injuries. The Mysteron assault intensifies, resulting {{in the deaths of}} Magenta and the remaining Angels, until only White, Blue and Lieutenant Green are left alive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Room.</b> As the stricken Cloudbase loses altitude, Green is killed by another explosion, which also cripples Blue and leaves him unable to save himself. White resolves to go down with his command, and is seen standing to attention and saluting in a spiralling freeze frame shot, accompanied by the sounds of Cloudbase crashing to Earth.|$|E

5|$|Scully {{decides to}} join Mulder in the game, {{and the two}} fight Maitreya together. Maitreya begins to {{duplicate}} herself, making the task of killing her more difficult. Finally, Maitreya sits atop a virtual tank and aims it at the agents. Phoebe admits there {{is one way to}} stop the game, but doing so will erase the entire program. Despite protests from Ivan, Phoebe gives Byers the kill command, effectively destroying Maitreya along with the game while saving Mulder and Scully. During Mulder's narration, we see that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>room</b> one of the monitors is still active. There, Ivan sees Maitreya's avatar, but with Scully's face.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor uses Amy's {{communication}} chip {{to track}} her location, and lands the TARDIS in the Silence's control room five days later. As River and Rory hold the Silence at bay, the Doctor shows them the live {{broadcast of the}} moon landing. As they watch, the Doctor uses his modification of the Apollo command module to insert Canton's recording of the wounded Silent into the footage of the landing. Because of this message, humans will now turn upon the Silence whenever they see them. The group frees Amy and departs in the TARDIS, while River kills all the Silence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>room.</b> Amy reassures Rory that the man he overheard her speaking of loving through the communication chip was him, not the Doctor.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} premiered on VEVO on December 14, 2011. Directed by Shane Drake, the video begins with Clarkson {{in a video}} control room, {{watching}} select flash mob videos submitted by various participants in different monitors. Throughout the video, scenes of Clarkson performing the song in three different settings (alone in a stage, with her band in a garden square, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>room)</b> alternate with various flash mob videos. Towards {{the end of the}} video, Clarkson, along with the people in the garden square, forms a flash mob featuring a same choreography.|$|E

5|$|While {{filming the}} scene where Keller and her team perform a Decompressive {{craniectomy}} on Weir, an actual brain surgeon performed the same procedure on a head model live from ten feet away, and directed the cast on what to do. While following the surgeon, Staite was nervous about doing the scene. After filming was completed, the surgeon's voice {{was removed from the}} final cut. During the sequence where the city travels through a clearing in the asteroid field, the producers wanted {{the scene where}} Atlantis gets hit by the odd asteroid as authentic as possible, so <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>room,</b> not only the cameras, but the screens and tables on the set were shaken slightly as well.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{comes to}} the end of the {{transcript}} and Sally realises Larry has stopped writing it due to the presence of an Angel in the room. The Doctor, surmising their fate, warns them not even to blink around the Angels. Sally and Larry make their way to the basement of the house and discover more Angels guarding the TARDIS. The Angels attack and Sally and Larry use the Yale key to hide inside the TARDIS. The Angels surround and rock the TARDIS to try to gain entry. Once <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>room,</b> a hologram of the Doctor informs them that they have a control disk with them. Larry takes a now-glowing DVD from his pocket and inserts it into the console. The TARDIS' engines engage and the ship dematerialises, leaving a panicking Sally and Larry behind. With the TARDIS gone, the Angels who were all stood around the TARDIS have been tricked into looking at each other and have become permanently frozen as statues.|$|E
5|$|On 25 June 2012, the Delhi Police Department arrested Zabiuddin Ansari alias Abu Hamza, {{one of the}} key {{suspects}} in the attack at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi. His arrest was touted as the most significant development in the case since Kasab's arrest. Security agencies had been chasing him for three years in Delhi. Ansari is a Lashker-e-Taiba ultra and the Hindi tutor of the 10 attackers who were responsible for the Mumbai attacks in 2008. He was apprehended, after he was arrested and deported to India by Saudi Intelligence officials as per official request by Indian authorities. After Ansari's arrest, investigations revealed that in 2009 he allegedly stayed for a day in a room in Old Legislators's Hostel, belonging to Fauzia Khan, a former MLA and minister in Maharashtra Government. The minister, however, denied having any links with him. Home Minister P. Chidambaram, asserted that Ansari was provided a safe place in Pakistan and was present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>room,</b> which could not have been established without active State support. Ansari's interrogation further revealed that Sajid Mir and a Pakistani Army major visited India under fake names as cricket spectators to survey targets in Delhi and Mumbai for about a fortnight.|$|E

Finally, a pluridisciplinary research approach is proposed. RELEVANCE TO INDUSTRY Field studies show that there exist many poorly adapted "intelligent " assistance systems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls</b> <b>rooms</b> of complex industrial processes. One reason is that to be really efficient, these tools particularly have to consider the use of time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> different human tasks. The development of better knowledge engineering workbenches explicitly utilizing the time is crucial. This paper proposes such a contribution in this field...|$|R

25|$|Additional {{staff were}} placed on duty <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>room.</b> Eurotunnel's policy of {{attempting}} to drive trains through the tunnel {{in the event of}} an on-board fire with a backup plan of uncoupling the locomotive and amenity coach and driving out were abandoned and replaced by plans to bring trains to a controlled stop and evacuate the occupants into the service tunnel. Liaison between Eurotunnel and emergency services was improved with joint exercises and exchanges of personnel between the British and French fire brigades, so that each had experience with the other's operational procedures. Communications were also improved.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{improvements}} of the IXC type over the previous IXBs, U-175 was able to carry an extra 43 tonnes of fuel, giving her a capacity of 208 tonnes. Her power plant was heavier than those in previous models, {{and in order to}} accommodate this and balance the boat, the engine room was built directly aft of the control room, as opposed to behind the galley like in other types. The periscope <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>room</b> was also deleted, leaving the boat with just two of the optical devices, both of which were located in the conning tower.|$|E

25|$|Smoke {{is still}} rising from units 2 and 3, but is less visible, and is theorized to be steam {{following}} operations to spray water onto the buildings. Repair work resumes, {{after having been}} halted because of concerns over the smoke; it is felt safe because no significant changes in radiation levels have occurred. Work continues to restore electricity, and a supply cable is connected to unit 4. Injection of seawater into units 1–3 continues. External power cables are reported {{to be connected to}} all six units and lighting is back on again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>room</b> of unit 3.|$|E
25|$|The line is {{monitored}} from the Operations Control Center (OCC). Responsibility for controlling service {{is shared by}} the control room and field personnel along the right of way. Track circuit and signal indications are not transmitted to the operational personnel sites. In lieu of track circuit indications, the AVI system is displayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>room</b> to provide a periodic update to train position wherever AVI detectors exist. The AVI system user interface was solely text based until the current control room was opened, in which a new schematic display based on AVI data was instituted. Track circuit indications are available digitally in signal houses at the Park Street interlocking, at the new North Station interlocking, and at the new Kenmore interlocking, but are not transmitted to OCC. In January 2013, the MBTA announced plans to add full vehicle location tracking on the Green Line for countdown signs and smartphone applications, including using AVI data in the tunnels and GPS receivers on the surface lines. The first real-time data—location data on the surface lines—became available in October 2014. Full tracking is expected by early 2015.|$|E
25|$|Early on 17 March, TEPCO {{requested}} {{another attempt}} by the military to put water on the reactor using a helicopter and four helicopter drops of seawater took place around 10:00 JST. The riot police used a water cannon to spray water onto {{the top of the}} reactor building and then were replaced by members of the SDF with spray vehicles. On 18 March, a crew of firemen took over the task with six fire engines each spraying 6 tons of water in 40 minutes. 30 further hyper rescue vehicles were involved in spraying operations. Spraying continued each day to 23 March because of concerns the explosion in Unit 3 may have damaged the pool (total 3,742 tonnes of water sprayed up to 22 March) with changing crews to minimise radiation exposure. Lighting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>room</b> was restored on 22 March after a connection was made to a new grid power supply and by 24 March it was possible to add 35 tonnes of seawater to the spent fuel pool using the cooling and purification system. On 21 March grey smoke was reported to be rising from the southeast corner of Unit 3 – where the spent fuel pool is located. Workers were evacuated from the area. TEPCO claimed no significant change in radiation levels and the smoke subsided later the same day.|$|E

25|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} at Aobadai Studio in Meguro, Tokyo, {{in a single}} take, as a method to retain an emotional feel to the song. The band experimented with the song in demo sessions recorded by their regular recording engineer Masashi Uramoto, while Yamaguchi ad-libbed material. One take of the song was recorded by the project's assistant engineer, Ayaka Toki. The band liked the dynamic nature of her mix, feeling it had a strong indie rock sound, feeling it was similar to a rough recording by an independent band with little sound processing and equalization, and asked Toki to become the leading engineer for the song. The band asked Toki to retain the rough sound of the song for the final mix, believing it was beneficial to expressing the song's dynamic range. The band did not use any of the recording booths at Aobadai Studio, instead recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>room</b> while Toki sat next to the band. As Sakanaction member Ami Kusakari was ill during the recording, the take did not include bass guitar. The other band members felt that this created a strange vibe in the recording studio, as {{they were used to}} Kusakari's bassline being the basis for their songs. After her condition improved, Kusakari overdubbed her bass guitar parts into the song.|$|E
25|$|The {{track work}} is quite complex there, {{allowing}} trains {{to enter the}} Pitkin Yard from both the express and local tracks (where C trains relay {{to get from the}} southbound to the northbound local track), and with connections to the two-track Grant Avenue station from both the express and local tracks; the Grant Avenue spur then veers northeast towards Liberty Avenue. All four mainline tracks continue below the Grant Avenue connection, used only to store trains, east under Pitkin Avenue until approximately Eldert Lane (just south of the Grant Avenue station). It was planned that these tracks would continue under Pitkin Avenue to Cross Bay Boulevard, as part of a never-built system expansion which would have extended the Fulton Street Subway to the Rockaways and to Cambria Heights near the Queens-Nassau County border. On the electric light signal board <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>room</b> at Euclid Avenue, there is a taped-over section of the board that hides the 76th Street station. There are also two tracks coming from the Pitkin Yard heading towards the planned 76th Street station site. These tracks would have merged with the mainline tracks just before 76th Street station. When Pitkin Yard originally opened, the yard leads toward 76th Street were usable to relay short trains on. Today, those two tracks are no longer connected via switches. Parts of the trackways still exist, but the switches were removed and the tunnel ends in a cinderblock wall.|$|E
