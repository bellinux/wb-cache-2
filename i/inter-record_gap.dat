5000|$|<b>Inter-record</b> <b>Gap</b> : A gap (initially one inch, later 3/4 inch) between records {{allowed the}} {{mechanism}} {{time to start}} and stop the tape.|$|E
50|$|Different {{low-level}} formats {{can be used}} on {{the same}} media; for example, large records can be used to cut down on <b>inter-record</b> <b>gap</b> size.|$|E
50|$|Blocks are {{typically}} separated {{on the track}} by inter-record gaps. Together, the block size {{and the size of}} the <b>inter-record</b> <b>gap</b> determine how many blocks can fit in each track. To read or write a block on an FBA disk, the computer would address the block using the traditional CHS three number address.|$|E
40|$|TAPECERT is VAX {{utility program}} for tape certification. Allows user to select tape density, test pattern to use, {{and number of}} allowed retries, and {{to decide whether to}} allow {{extended}} <b>inter-record</b> <b>gaps</b> to skip past bad spots on tape. Displays system error messages and record-count information with totals every 1, 000 blocks. Designed so command procedure set up with defaults for different types of certification runs. Written in FORTRAN 77...|$|R
50|$|Storage media {{may have}} areas which become {{inaccessible}} by normal means. For example, magnetic disks may develop new bad sectors after data has been written, and tapes require <b>inter-record</b> <b>gaps.</b> Modern hard disks often feature reallocation of marginal sectors or tracks, automated {{in a way}} that the operating system would not need to work with it. The problem is especially significant in solid state drives (SSDs) that rely on relatively large relocated bad block tables. Attempts to counter data remanence by overwriting may not be successful in such situations, as data remnants may persist in such nominally inaccessible areas.|$|R
40|$|A tape {{certification}} program tests the useability of magnetic tape at different densities by writing test patterns and re-reading them. The ability to certify tapes {{is important in}} environments that do large amounts of tape processing. TAPECERT is a VAX utility for tape certification in use at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Multi-Mission Image Processing Laboratory which handles data from projects such as Voyager and Galileo. TAPECERT allows the user to select the tape density, the test pattern to use, the number of allowed retries, and whether to allow extended <b>inter-record</b> <b>gaps</b> to skip past bad spots on the tape. The program displays system error messages (parity errors, for instance) and record count information, with totals every 1000 blocks. TAPECERT is designed such that command procedures {{can be set up}} with defaults for different types of certification runs. TAPECERT is written in FORTRAN 77 for interactive execution and has been implemented on a DEC VAX series computer operating under VMS level 3. 7 and level 4. 2. TAPECERT utilizes standard VMS system services and run-time library routines. This program was developed in 1985...|$|R
5000|$|Like its audio counterpart, moving tape {{past the}} read/write heads on nine-track digital {{required}} precise control, accomplished by a capstan motor. The capstan motor {{was designed for}} very smooth operation. Feedback to the control electronics was accomplished by a tachometer, usually an optical [...] "tone wheel", to control tape velocity. Starting and stopping the capstan was controlled by ramp generators to ensure a properly sized <b>inter-record</b> <b>gap,</b> the gap between blocks of information.|$|E
50|$|There is a cost {{associated}} with record oriented. The length definition takes up space. On a magnetic tape that definition {{takes the form}} of an <b>inter-record</b> <b>gap.</b> On a disk a meta data area must be allocated. This is minimal in a file where all the records are the same length. On a file composed of varying length records a maximum record length is defined to determine the size of the length metadata {{associated with}} each record.|$|E
50|$|In {{nonsynchronous}} operation, {{the transfer}} of data between the channel and the storage control is not synchronized with {{the transfer of}} data between the storage control and the device. Channel programs can be executed such that channel and storage control activities required to end execution of one command and advance to the next {{do not have to}} occur during the <b>inter-record</b> <b>gap</b> between two adjacent fields. An intermediate buffer in the storage control allows independent operations between the channel and the device. A major advantage of ECKDs is far longer cables; depending upon application it may improve performance.|$|E
5000|$|... 9-track 800 NRZI and 1600 PE (phase encoding) tapes use a 0.6 in <b>inter-record</b> <b>gap</b> (IRG) between data {{records to}} allow the tape to stop and start between records. 6250 GCR tapes use a tighter 0.3 in IRG. The 9-track tapes had {{reflective}} stickers placed 10 ft {{from the beginning of}} tape (BOT) and 14 ft from the end of tape (EOT) to signal the hardware. Nine-track tapes commonly had densities of 800, 1600, and 6250 cpi, giving 22.5MB, 45MB and 175MB respectively on a standard 2400 ft tape. Signaling EOT (end of tape) with space remaining to write trailer blocks allowed support for multivolume labelled tapes.|$|E
