50|$|Waterless {{printing}} is an offset {{lithographic printing}} process that eliminates {{the water or}} dampening system used in conventional printing. It uses silicone rubber coated printing plates and specially formulated inks, and typically a temperature-control system is integrated into waterless presses. Waterless offset presses do not use dampening solution to keep the plate's nonimage areas free of ink. These presses function because the plate's nonimage areas consist of a layer of silicon that repels ink. A waterless press resembles a conventional offset press, except the dampening system might be missing. A more common design, however, includes a dampening system to allow the press to function conventionally when needed. Direct imaging (digital) offset presses are waterless, with no dampening system.Waterless offset inks have a higher tack and viscosity (thickness) and are generally stiffer than conventional offset inks. The temperature of the inks must be strictly controlled to maintain the correct viscosity because the plate surface is designed to repel inks of a specific viscosity. This temperature distinction is achieved by running chilled water through tubing in the hollow cores {{of two or more}} vibrating rollers in the <b>ink</b> <b>train</b> on the printing press.|$|E

50|$|Declining {{ridership}} {{and continuing}} red <b>ink</b> led the <b>train</b> to be jointly operated with the Great Northern's Empire Builder between Chicago and Minneapolis. By late 1967 the combination {{was joined by}} the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy's Twin Cities Zephyr. The eastbound North Coast Limited/Empire Builder was combined with the Morning Zephyr, while the westbound train combined with the Afternoon Zephyr.|$|R
40|$|A cross-application {{architecture}} for pen-based mathematical interfaces We {{address the}} problem of organizing pen-based environments for processing handwritten mathematics. Our approach is based on providing portable ink-aware mathematical interfaces to existing document processing software and mathematical packages. Our architecture includes components for on-line ink collection, mathematicallyoriented recognizers, portability support, and interfaces to applications. We present a pen-based computing environment Mathink and give an overview of its facilities for <b>training,</b> <b>ink</b> annotation and performance testing. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”We {{address the}} {{question}} of how to organize penbased interfaces for mathematical software systems, both for computational mathematics packages and document processing software. Our architecture includes components for ink collection, mathematically-oriented recognizers, portability support and interfaces to applications. We summarize aspects of mathematical handwriting recognition and discuss the methods we have used for individual character recognition and overall expression analysis. We present our pen-based computing environment, Mathink, and give an overview of facilities for <b>training,</b> <b>ink</b> annotation, and testing. I...|$|R

5000|$|Tibetan {{banknotes}} {{were first}} issued in January 1913 with the denominations of 5 tam (green or blue) and 10 tam (red). These were dated {{to the year}} 1658 of the Tibetan Era (which began in AD 1912 and ended in early 1913).Further issues followed later in AD 1913. All these notes are dated to the Tibetan Era year 1659, which began in February AD 1913. They are as follows: a 10 tam note (red), a 15 tam note (violet), a 25 tam note (brown or yellow), and a 50 tam note (blue or purple). Like the two earlier issues, they bear a red seal representing {{the authority of the}} Dalai Lama and a black seal which has the following inscription in 'phags pa ( [...] also called [...] "seal script") Tibetan script: gzhung dngul khang, and can be translated as [...] "government treasury" [...] or [...] "government bank".The five tam notes continued to be printed, but the date on this notes was not changed, i.e. it remained T.E.
