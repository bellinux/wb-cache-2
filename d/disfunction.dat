40|$|Structural {{diversity}} and functional performance insure the systems viability {{on a long}} term. Inherently, these ones suppose also varied causes/conjunctures with a disfunctional effect. The capacity to attenuate or to eliminate the produced <b>disfunctions,</b> {{on the basis of}} their own self-regulation resources, is the surest possibility to maintain the system’s status. The degradation/reduction of this capacity allows some interconnections of the initial <b>disfunctions,</b> with an aggravating effect and produces/attracts new <b>disfunctions</b> etc.;the adverse evolution orientates the system, gradually or rapidly, towards dezorganization. The attenuation of the <b>disfunctions,</b> the reconstruction and the maintainance of viability suppose either the spontaneous/conducted activation of some natural self-regulating devices or some deliberate actions in order to clear up the genesis of the functions, to obtain a diagnosis of the state and the documentation/substantialization of the decision. The actual quantitative domination of the sectorial diagnosis creates the wrong impression of a systemic reliable documentation. In reality, the sectorial documentation induces, extrapolating,analitical decisions over some complex, active areas which need a decisional synthesis. So, insufficient or unadvised documentation is at the origin of some big errors and losses. On the background of some strong disfunctional consequences, the succession of political, social and economic, variable and complex conjunctures of the last twenty years has introduced and produced in contemporary Romania a series of natural and social-economic <b>disfunctions</b> which potentiate themselves mutually, oversoliciting and sometimes exceeding their own redressing possibilities. The progressive continentalization of the regime of the main climatic elements, the increasing frequency and length of the extreme climatic phenomena, the frequency of the great pozitive oscillations of the river levels and flows, the oscillations with an important difference of value of the level of the underground waters, the increasing instability of the slopes and the exacerbated dynamics of the river beds etc. express the overbalancing of the natural interactive performance on our national territory. With strong implications in the political and social-economic performance, these <b>disfunctions</b> are often potentiated/ released by political and social-economic activities and decisions. By its capacity to produce an integrating, synthetic, fundamental and applicative research, the geographic demarche can insure a systemic diagnosis of state and, so, a pertinent documentation of the decision, building and offering - in its specific, spatialized vision – the quantified/qualitatively evaluated visual image of some elements, processes and phenomena, of some areas of actual acute interest: the natural dynamics of the slopes and of the river beds; the consequences of the land use on the actual morpho-dynamics; the liability to flooding; the anthropic impact on the underground waters; the spatial variability of the bio-climatic confort; the actual quality of the soil in relation to the natural pedogenetic processes and to the anthropic influence; the actual state and the evolutive trends of the natural ecosystems, the rehabilitation premises of the degraded ones; the evaluation of the natural potential and of the natural favorability for habitation, transportation and tourism; the evaluation of human-dermographic and economic potential; the identification of the objective forms of evolution of the network of human settlements; the analysis, the evaluation and the rational use/rehabilitation of the natural/anthropized ennvironment etc...|$|R

They were defeated only once by the Decepticons in [...] "Desertion of the Dinobots Part 1".

In every other instance, where the (non-combining) Decepticons faced the Dinobots, they were easily defeated. After consequently being rebuilt, the Dinobots dissention came to a culmination. When requested to return to immediate action, Grimlock snapped, absolutely refusing {{to do anything else}} for the [...] "Autobots". He sternly said goodbye, and left with the other dinobots in tow. They eventually ventured to Cybertron in [...] "Desertion of the Dinobots Part 2". Where they end up enslaved mining Cybertonium, a mineral vital to Cybertronians operational function, for the Decepticons, by having their personality chips disconnected by Shockwave. Swoop was the only one to have escaped imprisonment, due in fact to his assigned surveillance mission. Luckily the persistent Spike Witwicky and Carly Witwicky although only dating at this point, with the help of Swoop were able to rescue them.

Long term of pesticides exposure was able to cause many kinds of health disorder, including liver <b>disfunction.</b> Liver <b>disfunction</b> on women in childbearing-age would make bad impacts not only to themselves but also to their fetus when they were pregnant. Former research indicated that liver <b>disfunction</b> came {{as a result of}} pesticides exposure. Health Profiles of Kabupaten Brebes in 2007 and 2008 recorded increasing rate of liver <b>disfunction.</b> The objective of this research was to analize the assossiation between pesticides exposure and liver <b>disfunction</b> on women in childbearing-age at Kecamatan Kersana Kabupaten Brebes. Method : This was an explanatory research with cross sectional approach. This research took sample of 86 women in childbearing-age from four villages which were chosen purposively. Questionare, tool of blood sampling and laboratory testing, and sheet of laboratory result were used as instruments in this research. Data were collected by laboratory testing to blood samples and interviewing childbearing-age women. Result : All childbearing-age women had normal cholinesterase enzyme level, but 50 % of them had cholinesterase enzyme below mean level. Envolvement of childbearing-age women in farming activities was 74, 4 %. Based on cholinesterase enzyme level and envolvement in farming activities, it was concluded that 33 childbearing-age women (38, 4 %) had pesticides exposure. Occurence of childbearing-age women to have liver <b>disfunction</b> was 23, 3 %. There was no assossiation between pesticides exposure and liver <b>disfunction</b> on women in childbearing-age (p= 0, 538).

Group I (n= 22) included women getting basic therapy, group II (n= 26) included women getting both basic therapy and medications of artichoke and arginin glutamat. The control group included 20 pregnant women. Results and Discussion. Examination of women belonging to the main group showed the encreased indicators of ET- 1 levels (in 5 times) and TNF-a (in 2. 5 times).
