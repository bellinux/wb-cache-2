40|$|Incremental {{software}} development offers many benefits compared with more traditional development approaches. Indeed, incremental approaches have been utilised {{for many years}} due to the involvement of users, the early <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>capability</b> {{and the potential for}} risk reduction that they offer. However, there appears to have been little work on modelling, planning and controlling incremental development. The paper attempts to introduce a quantitative analytical framework for evaluating such approaches and their impacts on the development effort. Models that predict development effort as an exponential function of product size are used in the paper to explore some of the relationships between effort and the number of increments, thereby providing new insights into the economic impact of incremental approaches to software project...|$|E

A key element of the launch control system archi-tecture, the domain-specific language prototype is a specialized monitor and control language composed of constructs for specifying and programming test, checkout, and launch process-ing applications for flight and ground systems. The principal objectives of the prototyping activity were to perform a proof-of-concept of an approach to ultimately lower the lifecycle costs of application software for the launch control system, and to explore mitigations {{for a number of}} development risks perceived by the project. The language has been implemented as a library that extends the dynamically-typed Python scripting language, and validated in a <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>capability</b> required for Constellation. A study of the statically typed Scala programming language as an alternative domain-specific language implementation language is also presented. I...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{has sought to}} demonstrate the benefits of kinematic GPS in conjunction with photogrammetric aerial triangulation for mapping purposes. The work was performed with the existing INDOT aerial camera which is quite old, and while this affected {{the accuracy of the}} results, the <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>capability</b> with a likely potential for excellent results was achieved. Ground point accuracies from the strip were in the sub-meter range with only a single control point. This is contrasted with full-model control requiring 50 - 80 control points for such a strip. In order to bring accuracies down to an acceptable level, i. e. sub decimeter, {{it will be necessary to}} retrofit the INDOT camera with a better shutter event signal (or obtain a new camera). A computer program for least squares adjustment of independent models has been developed. This would permit processing of data from INDOT Wild B 8 stereoplotters. With a few implementation steps, INDOT would have an operational and production capability yielding significant productivity improvements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{range of}} first {{detection}} {{of an approaching}} target {{is among the most}} important parameters defining sensors and defensive surveillance systems. A <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>capability</b> therefore typically includes a demonstration of a sensor’s detection range, to show that the range of first detection occurs at notably greater range than competing systems, or to show that it exceeds minimum performance requirements. Such demonstrations are often carried out for the commercial sonars designed for underwater surveillance in port protection. Like any measurement, the observation of detection range is subject to unpredictable random variability, and this variability is important whenever practical conclusions are to be drawn from observed detection ranges, such as comparing the performance of one sonar against another or against minimum performance requirements. The variability also has implications for operations because the response measures taken by security forces against underwater intruders must be robust against the degree of variability that can be expected in their detection range. Here we report a sequence of detection ranges observed for repeated diver approaches for a commercially available sonar under realistic conditions during military experimentation for port protection. A probabilistic model is fit to the observations to explain much of their variance, and to extend the implications of such variance to performance evaluations and waterside security operations more generally...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the Three Arm Capture Mechanism (TACM) is {{to serve as a}} <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>capability</b> for capture of objects in space. These objects could be satellites, expended boosters, pieces of debris, etc.; anything of significant size. With this capability we can significantly diminish the danger of major collisions of debris with valuable space assets and with each other, which would otherwise produce many smaller, high velocity pieces of debris which also become concerns. The captured objects would be jettisoned into the atmosphere, relocated in 'parking' orbits, or recovered for disposition or refurbishment. The dollar value of satellites launched into space continues to grow along with the cost of insurance; having a capture capability takes a positive step towards diminishing this added cost. The effort covered is a planning step towards a flight demonstration of the satellite capture capability. Based on the requirement to capture a communication class satellite, its associated booster, or both, a preliminary system definition of a retrieval kit is defined. The {{objective of the}} flight demonstration is to demonstrate the techniques proposed to perform the mission and to obtain data on technical issues requiring an in situ space environment. The former especially includes issues such as automated image recognition techniques and control strategies that enable an unmanned vehicle to rendezvous and capture a satellite, contact dynamics between the two bodies, and the flight segment level of automation required to support the mission. A development plan for the operational retrieval capability includes analysis work, computer and ground test simulations, and finally a flight demonstration. A concept to perform a selected mission capturing a precessing communications satellite is described. Further development efforts using analytical tools and laboratory facilities are required prior to reaching the point at which a full commitment to the flight demonstration design can be made...|$|E

40|$|A major {{advance in}} {{microchannel}} {{heating and cooling}} technology is described and {{has the potential to}} change the way thermal processing of microscale fluidic samples is achieved. The microchannel {{is one of the key}} building blocks of micro total analysis systems (?TAS), which are already being released to market in the form of disposable test kits for biometrics and disease identification. However, significant cost reductions and other advances in microchannel heating and cooling technology are still needed and can be expected to improve the accuracy with which quantitative analysis can be performed. In part, this is because the fidelity of many existing and potential microfluidic applications is critically dependent on precise temperature control. The scientific objective of the study was to understand and then manipulate the physics of thermal transport within fine scale composite materials containing an embedded microchannel. In essence, it was necessary that the composition of the composite materials be manipulated in a precise way that established a particular nonlinear pattern of temperature along the length of the microchannel. In practice, this required the development of a systematic inverse solution process that could identify an acceptable composition to exactly match the desired pattern of temperature variation. As a <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>capability,</b> fully operational prototypes comprised of patterned copper laminated within polyimide and acrylic polymers were designed, fabricated, and tested. In terms of conceptual advances, this is the first time that composite materials of this type have been used for microchannel heating AND cooling. From an analytical perspective, the critical advance was the development of a robust simulation framework consisting of an outer optimization loop and an inner finite element analysis (FEA) loop, which was used to iteratively identify the optimal copper pattern for each of several applications. In terms of experimental advances, the key fabrication steps included UV laser micromachining, acid etching, microchannel formation, and hot vacuum lamination. To avoid any ambiguity or artifact, microchannel temperatures were painstakingly measured at each of several flow rates using fine thermocouples embedded in the microchannel wall. For the most part, the measured temperatures were within 1 ?C of the expected values based on simulation, with spatial temperature gradients of up to +/- 94 ?C/mm (or equivalently +/- 188 ?C/s at 2 &# 61549;l/min flow rate) within the range of 16 ?C to 92 ?C, using a resistively heated source at 100 ?C and a thermoelectrically cooled sink at 2 ?C. The temperature profiles studied here included two highly nonlinear cyclical profiles applicable to 1) continuous-flow polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 2) thermally mediated counter-flow separation in conjunction with electrophoresis...|$|E
