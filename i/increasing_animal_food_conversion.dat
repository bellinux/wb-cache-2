Mean hormone level in blood samples collected every four hours during a 24 hour period do differ between both strain of rats. So, the mean circulating levels of T 3, T 4 and corticosterone are significantly lower, whereas prolactin concentrations are higher in SD-rats. Following acute cold exposure comparable increases in plasma T 3 and T 4 are seen in both strains after 3 - 5 hours. Prolactin plasma concentrations are decreased after 5 and 9 hours but only in SD-rats, whereas they remain unchanged in Wistars. Acclimation to 4 degrees C during 3 and 8 weeks resulted in a decreased growth rate of the SD-rats, which becomes comparable to Wistar <b>animals,</b> but <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> is lower and food intake higher in SD-rats. A decrease in circulating levels of T 4 is present in Wistars resulting in a significantly lower figure at 8 weeks of cold acclimation, whereas {{at the same time}} T 3 is increased.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of chronic and acute digestive disorders of farm animals during the rearing period {{is an important}} problem. Not only do these disorders reduce the <b>animal's</b> <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> efficiency, but they may result in other economic losses by lowiring the quality and qualtity of the animal product or by causing {{the death of the}} animal. It has been established that early weaning of piglets increases the number of litters that a sow can produce during a year. However, the problem of providing the early weanted piglet with an adequate and digestible post-weaning diet is more complex than when weaning at a later age is practised. Weaning at 3 weeks of age is commonly practised at the Massey University College of Manawatu Research Piggery. During the last 4 years scouring has been a recurrent problem in piglets just prior to weaning and up to 9 weeks of age. At times this scouring has resulted in the death of the animal. Post mortem examination of the piglets revealed a considerable amount of damage to the large intestine. Cultural and microscopic examination of the faeces of scouring piglets has failed to find a common single etiological gent which would have been responsible. In the majority of cases scouring has been accompanied by the presence in the faeces of large amounts of undigested starch and large numbers lf Balantidium coli. There were indications that weaning at 6 weeks of age lowered the incidence of scours. The trial reported in this thesis was conducted at the Research Piggery and the Veterinary Pathology and Animal Physiology Department of the Massey University College of Manawatu. The principle objective was to study the changes which occured in the flora and fauna of the large intestine during the early growth of the pig, comparing early and late weaning. Also, to see if these changes are related to the digestive disturbances which have been found to occur in piglets at the Research Piggery. For economic reasons {{it was not possible to}} sacrifice piglets of this age in order to examine the large intestine and its contents as was originally planned.

As the huge <b>increase</b> of <b>animal</b> <b>food</b> consumption, the current agriculture system in China namely “grain farming”, whose major ani-mal feed are grains, seems to meet a great challenge to ensure China’s {{food security}} in the future. Not only the current situation, but also the production capacity as developing grassland agricul-ture is analyzed in this paper. The results show that half of provinces don’t have enough grain to meet their various needs for grain, and the whole country’s potential of grain yield is reaching a limited position. On the other hand, implementing cereal-forage rotation on 20 % of the total ara-ble land and developing high productivity sown pastures on 3 % of the total rangeland areas could create approximately 1. 2 times Arable Land Equivalent Unit (ALEU) than ever. So changing the traditional agriculture system into Grassland Agro-Ecosystems is an effective way to insure Chi-na’s food security. It includes utilization of rangeland rationally, establishment of more sown pas-ture and implementation of cereal-pasture rotation system, increase livestock production, and use of arable land more efficiently...|$|R
40|$|The FAO {{predicts a}} major <b>increase</b> in global <b>animal</b> <b>food</b> {{consumption}} to 2050. In this paper we investigate the climate effect {{of such a}} dietary shift. At present, food is responsible for 25 - 30 % of the global greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast to the energy sector, the main way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from food production seems to be through general productivity improvements, rather than from specific technological and agronomic mitigation measures. In this paper we estimate the resulting methane and nitrous oxide emissions from global agriculture in 2050, in two scenarios, one with moderate productivity improvement and one with rapid productivity improvements. We compare the emissions to emissions levels compatible with the climate target of keeping the global average warming below 2 degree above the pre-industrial level.

40|$|Evidence is <b>increasing</b> that soil <b>animal</b> <b>food</b> webs are {{fueled by}} root-derived carbon (C) {{and also by}} root-derived {{nitrogen}} (N). Functioning as link between the above- and belowground system, trees and their species identity are important drivers structuring soil animal communities. A pulse labeling experiment using 15 N and 13 C was conducted by exposing beech (Fagus sylvatica) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) seedlings to 13 CO 2 enriched atmosphere and tree leaves to 15 N ammonium chloride solution in a plant growth chamber under controlled conditions for 72 h. C and N fluxes into the soil <b>animal</b> <b>food</b> web of beech, associated with ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), and ash, associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), were investigated at two sampling dates (5 and 20 days after labeling). All of the soil animal taxa studied incorporated root-derived C, while root-derived N was only incorporated into certain taxa. Tree species identity strongly affected C and N incorporation with the incorporation in the beech rhizosphere generally exceeding that in the ash rhizosphere. Incorporation differed little between 5 and 20 days after labeling indicating that both C and N are incorporated quickly into soil animals and are used for tissue formation. Our results suggest that energy and nutrient fluxes in soil food webs depend on the identity of tree species with the differences being associated with different types of mycorrhiza. Further {{research is needed to}} prove the generality of these findings and to quantify the flux of plant C and N into soil food webs of forests and other terrestrial ecosystems...|$|R

This study investigates the relationship between early growth and the significant factors affecting growth, namely <b>food</b> intake, <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> and fluctuating environmental temperatures. Pale octopus (Octopus pallidus) hatchlings were reared in captivity under either a warming or cooling temperature regime. Individual variations and periodicity in feeding rates (Fr), <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> rates (Cr), growth rates (Gr), {{and the relationship between}} these variables and temperature were examined weekly. <b>Food</b> <b>conversion</b> rates were variable between individuals but also within individual octopus, which exhibited large fluctuations in Cr over time, exceeding 100 % d− 1 in one instance.

Changes in temperature were not significantly correlated to changes in Fr, Cr or Gr. Feeding rate did not appear to influence growth rate or <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> rate. <b>Food</b> <b>conversion</b> rate was negatively correlated to feeding rate in the same week, and positively correlated to growth rate. Short periods of low or no food consumption were common and the high values obtained for <b>food</b> <b>conversion</b> rate for some individuals suggest that octopus can grow substantially with little or no food intake.

Globally HIV positive people are marginalized and often dread that their HIV status will adversely affect them socially. The belief that HIV-infected people are somehow deviant, or misconceptions about the mode of transmission fuels anxiety, fear, and distrust, which translates into barriers to adequate health care, emotional distress, and actions that can have adverse affects on health outcomes. When working with HIV-infected individuals and those at risk of becoming infected with HIV, the impact of stigma can be crippling to research.

While this study specifically focused on HIV-infected women living in Kenya, the generalization gathered could be extrapolated to other populations. It is recommended that similar studies conduct focus groups with the study population prior to piloting, to ensure stakeholder input and an understanding of the particular challenges and concerns within a local context. Future studies should also employ individuals known in the community that the population trusts to assist with recruitment.

This is one serious problem which the world faces today. Another seriously nutritional problem is that more than 13 % of the world population is suffering from under-nutrition. Under-nutrition beyond nutritional adaptation is a risk factor leading to death.
