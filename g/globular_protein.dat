25|$|The name {{hemoglobin}} {{is derived}} from the words heme and globin, reflecting the fact that each subunit of hemoglobin is a <b>globular</b> <b>protein</b> with an embedded heme group. Each heme group contains one iron atom, that can bind one oxygen molecule through ion-induced dipole forces. The most common type of hemoglobin in mammals contains four such subunits.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of human SUMO1 is depicted on the right. It shows SUMO1 as a <b>globular</b> <b>protein</b> with {{both ends of}} the amino acid chain (shown in red and blue) sticking out of the protein's centre. The spherical core consists of an alpha helix and a beta sheet. The diagrams shown are based on an NMR analysis of the protein in solution.|$|E
25|$|SLiM {{functions}} {{in almost every}} pathway due to their critical role in regulatory function, protein-protein interaction and signal transduction. SLiM act as interaction modules that are recognised by additional biomolecules. The majority of known interaction partners of SLiMs are <b>globular</b> <b>protein</b> domains, though, SLiMs that recognise other intrinsically disordered regions, RNA and lipids have also been characterised. SLiMs can be broadly split into two high level classes, modification sites and ligand binding sites.|$|E

50|$|<b>Globular</b> <b>{{proteins}}</b> are {{proteins that}} contain a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic surface. <b>Globular</b> <b>proteins</b> often assume a stable structure, unlike fibrous proteins, which have multiple conformations. The three-dimensional structure of <b>globular</b> <b>proteins</b> is typically easier to determine through X-ray crystallography and {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} than both fibrous proteins and membrane <b>proteins,</b> which makes <b>globular</b> <b>proteins</b> more attractive for protein design than the other types of proteins. Most successful protein designs have involved <b>globular</b> <b>proteins.</b> Both RSD-1, and Top7 were de novo designs of <b>globular</b> <b>proteins.</b> Five more protein structures were designed, synthesized, and verified in 2012 by the Baker group. These new proteins serve no biotic function, but the structures are intended to act as building-blocks that can be expanded to incorporate functional active sites. The structures were found computationally by using new heuristics based on analyzing the connecting loops between parts of the sequence that specify secondary structures.|$|R
40|$|The dilute fluid {{phase of}} model <b>globular</b> <b>proteins</b> is studied. The model {{possesses}} a fluid-fluid transition buried within the fluid-crystal coexistence region, as do some <b>globular</b> <b>proteins.</b> If this fluid-fluid transition is not buried {{deep inside the}} fluid-crystal coexistence region the crystalline phase does not nucleate within the dilute fluid. We link this lack of nucleation of the crystal to the interactions in our model and speculate that similar interactions between <b>globular</b> <b>proteins</b> {{are responsible for the}} difficulty found in crystallising many <b>globular</b> <b>proteins.</b> Comment: 11 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
25|$|Reproduction {{is usually}} sexual, though hermaphrodites {{are capable of}} self-fertilization. Males are usually smaller than females/ hermaphrodites (often much smaller) and often have a {{characteristically}} bent or fan-shaped tail. During copulation, one or more chitinized spicules {{move out of the}} cloaca and are inserted into the genital pore of the female. Amoeboid sperm crawl along the spicule into the female worm. Nematode sperm is thought to be the only eukaryotic cell without the <b>globular</b> <b>protein</b> G-actin.|$|E
25|$|In most vertebrates, the {{hemoglobin}} molecule is an assembly of four <b>globular</b> <b>protein</b> subunits. Each subunit {{is composed of}} a protein chain tightly associated with a non-protein prosthetic heme group. Each protein chain arranges into a set of alpha-helix structural segments connected together in a globin fold arrangement. Such a name is given because this arrangement is the same folding motif used in other heme/globin proteins such as myoglobin. This folding pattern contains a pocket that strongly binds the heme group.|$|E
25|$|The {{solubility}} {{of proteins}} in aqueous buffers {{depends on the}} distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acid residues on the protein's surface. Hydrophobic residues predominantly occur in the <b>globular</b> <b>protein</b> core, but some exist in patches on the surface. Proteins that have high hydrophobic amino acid content on the surface have low solubility in an aqueous solvent. Charged and polar surface residues interact with ionic groups in the solvent and increase the solubility of a protein. Knowledge of a protein's amino acid composition will aid in determining an ideal precipitation solvent and methods.|$|E
50|$|<b>Globular</b> <b>{{proteins}}</b> or spheroproteins are spherical ("globe-like") {{proteins and}} {{are one of}} the common protein types (the others being fibrous, disordered and membrane <b>proteins).</b> <b>Globular</b> <b>proteins</b> are somewhat water-soluble (forming colloids in water), unlike the fibrous or membrane proteins. There are multiple fold classes of <b>globular</b> <b>proteins,</b> since there are many different architectures that can fold into a roughly spherical shape.|$|R

50|$|<b>Globular</b> <b>proteins</b> seem to {{have two}} {{mechanisms}} for protein folding, either the diffusion-collision model or nucleation condensation model, although recent findings have shown <b>globular</b> <b>proteins,</b> such as PTP-BL PDZ2, that fold with characteristic features of both models. These new findings {{have shown that the}} transition states of proteins may affect the way they fold. The folding of <b>globular</b> <b>proteins</b> has also recently been connected to treatment of diseases, and anti-cancer ligands have been developed which bind to the folded but not the natural protein. These {{studies have shown that the}} folding of <b>globular</b> <b>proteins</b> affects its function.|$|R
500|$|The cyclol {{hypothesis}} {{is the first}} structural model of a folded, <b>globular</b> <b>protein.</b> [...] It was developed by Dorothy Wrinch in the late 1930s, and was based on three assumptions. [...] Firstly, the hypothesis assumes that two peptide groups can be crosslinked by a cyclol reaction (Figure 1); these crosslinks are covalent analogs of non-covalent hydrogen bonds between peptide groups. [...] These reactions have been observed in the ergopeptides and other compounds. [...] Secondly, it assumes that, under some conditions, amino acids will naturally make the maximum possible number of cyclol crosslinks, resulting in cyclol molecules (Figure 2) and cyclol fabrics (Figure 3). [...] These cyclol molecules and fabrics have never been observed. [...] Finally, the hypothesis assumes that globular proteins have a tertiary structure corresponding to Platonic solids and semiregular polyhedra formed of cyclol fabrics with no free edges. [...] Such [...] "closed cyclol" [...] molecules have not been observed either.|$|E
2500|$|A {{heme group}} {{consists}} of an iron (Fe) ion (charged atom) held in a heterocyclic ring, known as a porphyrin. This porphyrin ring consists of four pyrrole molecules cyclically linked together (by methine bridges) with the iron ion bound in the center. The iron ion, which {{is the site of}} oxygen binding, coordinates with the four nitrogen atoms {{in the center of the}} ring, which all lie in one plane. The iron is bound strongly (covalently) to the <b>globular</b> <b>protein</b> via the N atoms of the imidazole ring of F8 histidine residue (also known as the proximal histidine) below the porphyrin ring. A sixth position can reversibly bind oxygen by a coordinate covalent bond, completing the octahedral group of six ligands. Oxygen binds in an [...] "end-on bent" [...] geometry where one oxygen atom binds to Fe and the other protrudes at an angle. When oxygen is not bound, a very weakly bonded water molecule fills the site, forming a distorted octahedron.|$|E

40|$|While {{there is}} {{abundant}} experimental and theoretical work on polymer-induced DNA condensation, {{it is still}} unclear whether <b>globular</b> <b>proteins</b> can condense linear DNA or not. We develop a simple analytical approximation for the depletion attraction between rodlike segments of semiflexible polyelectrolytes such as DNA, induced by nonbinding <b>globular</b> <b>proteins.</b> Monte Carlo simulations show that the approximation works well up to protein volume fractions of at least 20 %. From the expression for the depletion attraction we estimate instability thresholds by computing the effective virial coefficient of DNA segments in <b>protein</b> solutions. While <b>globular</b> <b>proteins</b> {{are found to be}} much poorer depletion agents than flexible polymers, {{it should be possible to}} condense linear DNA with small highly charged <b>globular</b> <b>proteins,</b> at relatively low ionic strength...|$|R
50|$|Alpha {{solenoids}} have unusual elasticity {{and flexibility}} relative to <b>globular</b> <b>proteins.</b> They are sometimes considered to occupy an intermediate position between <b>globular</b> <b>proteins</b> and fibrous structural proteins, {{distinct from the}} latter {{in part due to}} the alpha solenoids' lack of need for intermolecular interactions to maintain their structure. The extent of the curvature of an alpha solenoid superhelix varies considerably among the class, resulting in the ability of these proteins to form large, extended protein-protein interaction surfaces or to form deep concave areas for binding <b>globular</b> <b>proteins.</b>|$|R
40|$|Self-assembly {{has emerged}} as a {{powerful}} approach to control nanostructure in materials containing <b>globular</b> <b>proteins,</b> both through templated self-assembly and direct self-assembly of globular protein-polymer conjugates or fusion proteins. The folded structures of <b>globular</b> <b>proteins</b> that are critical to their function introduce complex shapes and interactions into block copolymers that significantly alter the physics of self-assembly.

5|$|Proteins can be informally {{divided into}} three main classes, which {{correlate}} with typical tertiary structures: <b>globular</b> <b>proteins,</b> fibrous proteins, and membrane <b>proteins.</b> Almost all <b>globular</b> <b>proteins</b> are soluble and many are enzymes. Fibrous proteins are often structural, such as collagen, the major component of connective tissue, or keratin, the protein component of hair and nails.

40|$|A simple {{model of}} <b>globular</b> <b>proteins</b> which {{incorporates}} anisotropic attractions is proposed. It {{is closely related}} to models used to model simple hydrogen-bonding molecules such as water. Theories for both the fluid and solid phases are presented, and phase diagrams calculated. The model protein exhibits a fluidfluid transition which is metastable with respect to the fluid-solid transition for most values of the model parameters. This is behaviour often observed for <b>globular</b> <b>proteins.</b> The model offers an explanation of the difficulty observed in crystallising some <b>globular</b> <b>proteins</b> and suggests that some proteins may not have a solid phase at all under all but extreme conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince natural {{proteins}} are {{the products}} of a long evolutionary process, the structural properties of present-day proteins should depend not only on physico-chemical constraints, but also on evolutionary constraints. Here we propose a model for protein evolution, in which membranes {{play a key role}} as a scaffold for supporting the gradual evolution from flexible polypeptides to well-folded proteins. We suggest that the folding process of present-day <b>globular</b> <b>proteins</b> is a relic of this putative evolutionary process. To test the hypothesis that membranes once acted as a cradle for the folding of <b>globular</b> <b>proteins,</b> extensive research on membrane proteins and the interactions of <b>globular</b> <b>proteins</b> with membranes will be required...|$|R
