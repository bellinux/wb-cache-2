Having completed his preparations, {{he leaned back in his}} easy chair and smiled. He smiled a long time, and even achieved a chuckle. For the first time in his life, he felt a serene sense of happiness in being particularly wide awake. Then, without moving from his chair, he ignited the taper, and put out his hand toward the bell-cord, to summon the porter.

In this paper, we present some examples of a quite different notion of applied sociology: one in which sociological insights are applied {{to the design of}} computer software. Sociology’s primary concern as a discipline can be considered to be the study of the interaction of agents, where ‘agents ’ are generally assumed to be people or human collectivities. The kind of application of sociology which we discuss trades on the possibility of widening the scope of agency to include non-animate systems. The success of this kind of applied sociology will depend in part on the degree to which artifacts can be considered to be agent...|$|E

If you are making the other Bryant service men feel only half the pleasure of being remembered that you afforded me, you are doing a magnificent job. My association with Bryant, albeit appreciated belatedly, was a happy one, and I am looking forward to the day when I can return and visit its memorable scenes. I don’t wish to sound fatherly or ‘corny’, but I envy you in your present association at Bryant. Many of my memories of Bryant, academically speaking, were painful, but most of them were pleasant. You will not appreciate your association at Bryant until you have left, but at some time, as is true in my case, you will find yourself wanting to go back even if only for a short visit. I have already met two of my classmates of 1941 since I have been in the Army. One of them is Joe Crawford who means little to you but a name. But I am sure that Mr. Lee or Mr. Appleby would remember him. He is also stationed here at Miami Beach. <b>In</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not already know the location of another Bryant man, I should give you his Army address as I know he would appreciate hearing from you. Here it is: Pvt. Henry Kovacs 331 st Ser. Grp., Sqdn F. Pendleton Field, Oregon Again, my sincere thanks for the smokes and a wish for a Happy New Year to the students and faculty.

40|$|Quadratic hedging is a {{specific}} form of utility hedging, where the strategy minimizes the hedging error in mean square sense. Hence risk is in this case quantified as variance. One of the obvious drawbacks of quadratic hedging is that losses and gains are treated in the same way. On the other hand, this might be an advantage, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know whether you deal with a buyer or a seller. Another advantage is that quadratic strategies related to different options can simply be added up as {{is also the case}} for delta-hedging strategies. In other words, quadratic hedging is a sort of linear hedging strategy. The mean-variance hedging strategy is one of the two main quadratic hedging strategies we will discuss. The other one is the (locally) risk-minimizing hedging strategy. In the mean-variance hedging theory the goal is to minimize the difference between the claim H at maturity T and the portfolio at that time, using a self-financing strategy. In the risk-minimizing hedging strategy, the goal is to minimize the variance of the cost process at any time t subject to the condition that the value of the portfolio at time T equals the claim H. In the latter case, it is only possible to find a self-financing portfolio when the claim is attainable. The risk-minimizing hedging strategy only makes sense when the underlying is a martingale, the extension to semimartingales is called local risk-minimization. We focus mainly on quadratic hedging and especially on the locally risk-minimizing hedging strategy and related to it, the Föllmer-Schweizer decomposition. We do not only look at the pure financial market, but we also determine hedging strategies for the insurance market, {{as well as for the}} interest rate derivatives market and the commodity market. At the end we also discuss the implementation of the quadratic hedging strategies and compare the total costs related to different hedging strategies...|$|E

The game is to get as near nine as possible, ten, and court cards, not counting at all. If the Banker has eight or nine, he does not offer cards; if he has less, he gives the two players, if they ask for them, one card each, and takes one himself if he chooses.
