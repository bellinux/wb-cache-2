At metamorphosis, the larva forms a pupa, inside which the larval tissues are reabsorbed and the imaginal tissues undergo extensive morphogenetic movements to form adult structures.|$|E
25|$|Four larval instars {{have been}} {{described}} based on their morphological characters. With the exception of size differences, the larvae of the minor and major workers are almost impossible to distinguish. Major worker fourth-instar larvae tend to be larger than minor worker prepupae with a wider width. Only the reproductive larvae are larger than major workers and in general, are very robust. Even male third-instar larvae tend to be longer and larger than third-instar workers. No significant morphological difference can distinguish male and queen larvae, but the internal gonopodal <b>imaginal</b> <b>discs</b> differ. Most larval changes are not significant, but the moulting of third-instar larvae and studies of their eclosion support four larval-instar stages.|$|E

Additionally, there is experimental evidence for this gene to function in 13 unique biological processes, including biological regulation, phosphorus metabolic process, establishment of planar polarity, positive regulation of biological process, cellular process, single-organism developmental process, response to stimulus, response to organic substance, sensory organ development, macromolecule modification, growth, cellular component organization or biogenesis, and rhythmic process. The gene's alternative name, discs overgrown, refers to {{its role as a}} cell growth regulating gene that has strong effects of cell survival and growth control in <b>imaginal</b> <b>discs,</b> an attribute of the larvae fly stage.

We show that Drosophila FGF is used, only in males, to recruit mesodermal cells expressing its receptor {{to become part of}} the genital <b>imaginal</b> <b>disc.</b> Male-specific deployment of FGF signaling is controlled by the sex determination regulatory gene doublesex. The recruited mesodermal cells become epithelial and differentiate into parts of the internal genitalia. Our results provide exceptions to two basic tenets of <b>imaginal</b> <b>disc</b> biology—that <b>imaginal</b> <b>disc</b> cells are derived from the embryonic ectoderm and belong to either an anterior or posterior compartment.

500|$|The zygote (fertilised egg) divides by spiral {{cleavage}} {{and grows}} by determinate development, {{in which the}} fate of a cell can usually be predicted from its predecessors in the process of division. The embryos of most taxa develop either directly to form juveniles (like the adult but smaller) or to form planuliform larvae, in which the larva's long axis {{is the same as the}} juvenile's. The planuliform larva stage may be short-lived and lecithotrophic ("yolky") before becoming a juvenile, or may be planktotrophic, swimming for some time and eating prey larger than microscopic particles. However, many members of the order Heteronemertea and the palaeonemertean family Hubrechtidae form a pilidium larva, which can capture unicellular algae and which Maslakova describes as like a deerstalker cap with the ear flaps pulled down. It has a gut which lies across the body, a mouth between the [...] "ear flaps", but no anus. A small number of <b>imaginal</b> <b>discs</b> form, encircling the archenteron (developing gut) and coalesce to form the juvenile. When it is fully formed, the juvenile bursts out of the larva body and usually eats it during this catastrophic metamorphosis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCellular {{interaction}} between the proximal and distal domains of the limb plays key roles in proximal–distal patterning. In Drosophila, these domains are established in the embryonic leg <b>imaginal</b> <b>disc</b> as a proximal domain expressing escargot, surrounding the Distal-less expressing distal domain in a circular pattern. The leg <b>imaginal</b> <b>disc</b> {{is derived from the}} limb primordium that also gives rise to the wing <b>imaginal</b> <b>disc.</b> We describe here essential roles of Wingless in patterning the leg <b>imaginal</b> <b>disc.</b> Firstly, Wingless signaling is essential for the recruitment of dorsal–proximal, distal, and ventral–proximal leg cells. Wingless requirement in the proximal leg domain appears to be unique to the embryo, since it was previously shown that Wingless signal transduction is not active in the proximal leg domain in larvae. Secondly, downregulation of Wingless signaling in wing disc is essential for its development, suggesting that Wg activity must be downregulated to separate wing and leg discs. In addition, we provide evidence that Dll restricts expression of a proximal leg-specific gene expression. We propose that those embryo-specific functions of Wingless signaling reflect its multiple roles in restricting competence of ectodermal cells to adopt the fate of thoracic appendages...|$|R

In third instar larvae, the <b>imaginal</b> leg <b>discs</b> invaginate into the body cavity, and only four of the dendrites (the outer segments of which become greatly elongated) remain in contact with Keilin 2 ̆ 7 s organ.

40|$|AbstractThe adult {{musculature}} in D. melanogaster forms during metamorphosis. Much {{is known}} about the flight and leg musculature, but not about the muscles surrounding the male reproductive tract. The inner genitalia of males consist of the testes, which emerge from the gonads; the remaining genital organs, i. e., paragonia (or accessory glands), ejaculatory duct, sperm pump, and seminal vesicles, develop out of the genital <b>imaginal</b> <b>disc.</b> We analyzed the myoblasts forming the muscle layers of these organs. In myoblasts derived from the genital <b>imaginal</b> <b>disc,</b> the regulatory region of the transcription factor DMef 2 is active. DMef 2 is also needed for specification and differentiation of embryonic and adult myoblasts. We could discriminate three different muscle types: (i) multinucleated muscles that resemble vertebrate smooth muscles surround the testes, (ii) multinucleated muscles that resemble striated muscles comprises seminal vesicles and the sperm pump, and (iii) mononucleated striated musculature encloses the paragonia and ejaculatory duct. Members of the immunoglobulin superfamily involved in embryonic myogenesis, Dumbfounded (Duf) and Sticks and Stones (Sns), were also expressed in the genital <b>imaginal</b> <b>disc,</b> in the muscle sheath of the testes during muscle differentiation and in the secretory secondary cells, which are part of the binucleated epithelia enclosing the paragonia...|$|R

Receptors for signaling proteins are present in motile vesicles in cytonemes, and receptors for different signaling proteins segregate specifically to different types of cytonemes. In Drosophila, cytonemes have been found in wing and eye <b>imaginal</b> <b>discs,</b> trachea, lymph glands and ovaries. They have also been described in spider embryos, earwig ovaries, Rhodnius, Calpodes, earthworms, retroviral-infected cells, mast cells, B-lymphocytes and neutrophils.

40|$|Background: The {{development}} of the Drosophila eye <b>imaginal</b> <b>disc</b> requires complex epithelial rearrangements. Cells of the morphogenetic furrow are apically constricted and {{this leads to a}} physical indentation in the epithelium. Posterior to the furrow, cells start to rearrange into distinct clusters and eventually form a precisely patterned array of ommatidia. These morphogenetic processes include regulated changes of adhesion between cells. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we show that two transmembrane adhesion proteins, Capricious and Tartan, have dynamic and complementary expression patterns in the eye <b>imaginal</b> <b>disc.</b> We also describe novel null mutations in capricious and double null mutations in capricious and tartan. We report that they have redundant functions in regulating the architecture of the morphogenetic furrow and ommatidial spacing.

However, the pupae may be exarate (have movable legs, wings, antennae, etc.) or obtect (covered in a hard case with the legs and wings attached immovably against the body). They have a hard protective coating and often use camouflage to evade potential predators.|$|E
