It was also raining and freezing when we shot it, and {{it was meant to be}} a Mediterranean climate.

500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E

2500|$|Although [...] in 1687 Leopold I {{promised that}} he would uphold the {{constitution}} of the kingdom, in making policy for the re-conquested territories he relied almost exclusively on his Austrian and Bohemian counselors. They linked German language and culture with Catholicism as an instrument for installing greater loyalty to the Habsburg dynasty. Therefore, a large number of Catholic German colonists were settled {{in many parts of the}} one-time [...] "Ottoman Hungary". The one Hungarian influential member of the monarch's inner circle was Leopold Kollonitsch, archbishop of Esztergom (16951707) who had once predicted {{that he would}} [...] "first render Hungary obedient, then destitute, and finally Catholic". Although the monarch himself never acted on the archbishop's appeal for wholesale Catholicization, the document known as the Explanatio Leopoldina issued in 1691 by Leopold <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> religious freedom in the re-conquered lands was only temporary. On the other hand, Leopold I granted extensive religious autonomy to the approximately 200,000 Serbs who fled under the Orthodox Patriarch of Peć, Arsenije III Čarnojević to the liberated territories of the kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|When Lambert {{arrived at}} the BBC in June 1963, she was {{initially}} given a more experienced associate producer, Mervyn Pinfield, to assist her. Doctor Who debuted on 23 November 1963 and quickly became a success for the BBC, chiefly on {{the popularity of the}} alien creatures known as Daleks. Lambert's superior, Head of Serials Donald Wilson, had strongly advised against using the script in which the Daleks first appeared, but after the serial's successful airing, he said that Lambert clearly knew the series far better than he did, and he would no longer interfere in her decisions. The success of Doctor Who and the Daleks also garnered press attention for Lambert herself; in 1964, the Daily Mail published a feature on the series focusing on its young producer's looks: [...] "The operation of the Daleks... is conducted by a remarkably attractive young woman called Verity Lambert who, at 28, is not only the youngest but the only female drama producer at B.B.C. TV... all, dark and shapely, she became positively forbidding when <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the Daleks might one day take over Dr. Who." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} arranged, rehearsed, and {{recorded}} in five months. Its recording location caused several disagreements within the group. Anderson and Wakeman wished to {{record in the}} countryside, Squire and Howe preferred to record in London, and White had no particular preference. Anderson expressed a wish to record in a forest at night under a tent with electrical generators buried into the ground so they would be inaudible, but [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that,</b> they all said, 'Jon, get a life!'" [...] Eddy Offord, {{who had worked with}} the group since 1970, assumed his role as their audio engineer and producer who shared production duties with the band. He tried to push Brian Lane, the band's manager, to record in the country, thinking [...] "some flowers and trees" [...] would lessen the tension within the band that the album had caused. A decision was made to stay in London and record at Morgan Studios in Willesden, partly {{due to the fact that}} the studio housed the country's first 24-track tape machine, produced by Ampex, which presented more recording opportunities, though Squire recalled the machine malfunctioned often. Roughly one month into rehearsals, the band took a break from recording, during which Anderson vacated to Marrakesh with his wife, and developed the lyrics during his stay there. Squire worked in the studio for as long as sixteen-hour days, seven days a week on the album.|$|E
2500|$|In 1884, {{following}} his final term at Carlisle, Standing Bear, {{armed with a}} recommendation by Captain Pratt, returned home to the Rosebud Agency, Rosebud, South Dakota, where he was hired as an assistant at the reservation's school at the salary of three hundred dollars a year. In 1890, some time after Wounded Knee, Luther moved from Rosebud and followed his father and brother Ellis Standing Bear to Pine Ridge, South Dakota. [...] Pine Ridge provided a series of varying employment and family ventures. In 1891, Luther became principal of a reservation day school. Standing Bear also worked in his uncle’s little general store. [...] One day {{they were talking about}} the delay in mail delivery. [...] “I told my uncle that John Wanamaker, the man for whom I had worked in Philadelphia, was Postmaster-General, and that I would write and see if we could not have a post office established at his camp. [...] <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> we call it Kyle. [...] It was a short name and easy to spell. [...] When Mr. Wanamaker received my letter, he replied immediately. [...] He was pleased with my suggestion, but said that he could not appoint me postmaster, as I was an Indian. [...] It would have to be some white man. [...] There was a Joseph Taylor who was one of our missionaries, and we sent his name. [...] He received the appointment, but I took care of the office.” [...] Later, Luther opened a dry goods store with his brother Ellis at Pass Creek and started a small ranch raising horses and cattle. Standing Bear organized public meetings at his dry goods store in Pine Ridge to discuss treaties and current events.|$|E

40|$|Part I, {{describes}} how the NAS Report characterizes “scientific culture. ” <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the described attributes of scientific culture are vague and unspecific, and that more thought is necessary to elucidate how they might map onto forensic science.

In Part III, I posit a conception of science as work rather than method.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a number of}} novel perspectives on risk classification, primarily {{in the context of}} life and critical illness insurance. <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the terminology of "adverse selection" is often misleading, because from a public policy viewpoint, adverse selection may not always be adverse. <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> public policymakers should consider the criterion of "loss coverage", and that in many markets a socially optimal level of adverse selection is that which maximises loss coverage. A review of empirical studies <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> adverse selection is often difficult to observe in practice; this leads to the concept of propitious selection, and various psychological perspectives on risk classification. <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> competition between insurers in risk classification can sometimes be characterised as a malevolent invisible hand, and that public policy should direct competition towards areas that are more clearly beneficial to all insurance customers. I also consider the perspectives of risk classification as blame, the conflict between risk classification and human rights, and the fallacy of the one-shot gambler...|$|R
