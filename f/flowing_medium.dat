50|$|An {{example of}} the Stefan flow occurs when a droplet of liquid evaporates in air. In this case, the vapor/air mixture {{surrounding}} the droplet is the flowing fluid, and liquid/vapor boundary of the droplet is the interface. As heat is absorbed by the droplet from the environment, some of the liquid evaporates into vapor at {{the surface of the}} droplet, and flows away from the droplet as it is displaced by additional vapor evaporating from the droplet. This process causes the <b>flowing</b> <b>medium</b> {{to move away from the}} droplet at some mean speed that is dependent on the evaporation rate and other factors such as droplet size and composition. In addition to this mean flow, a concentration gradient must exist in the neighborhood of the droplet (assuming an isolated droplet) since the <b>flowing</b> <b>medium</b> is mostly air far from the droplet and mostly vapor near the droplet. This gradient causes Fickian diffusion that transports the vapor away from the droplet and the air towards it, with respect to the mean flow. Thus, in the frame of the droplet, the flow of vapor away from the droplet is faster than for the pure Stefan flow, since diffusion is working in the same direction as the mean flow. However, the flow of air away from the droplet is slower than the pure Stefan flow, since diffusion is working to transport air back towards the droplet against the Stefan flow. Such flow from evaporating droplets is important in understanding the combustion of liquid fuels such as diesel in internal combustion engines, and in the design of such engines. The Stefan flow from evaporating droplets and subliming ice particles also plays prominently in meteorology as it influences the formation and dispersion of clouds and precipitation.|$|E
50|$|The axial {{expansion}} joint absorbs movement in an axial direction. Standard connectors of the {{axial expansion}} joint are welded ends, fixed flanges and loose flanges. Axial expansion joints are often equipped with a guiding tube {{on the inside of}} the metal bellows. This reduces the flow resistance and prevents damage caused by direct contact with the <b>flowing</b> <b>medium.</b> Axial expansion joints, which can absorb large movements, frequently consist of two metal bellows and an inside or outside sleeve that protects against buckling under internal pressure. For small nominal diameters, protective tubes prevent mechanical damage during installation and operation. Axial expansion joints are suitable for internal and external overpressure. If pressure is applied to the outside of the metal bellows of {{axial expansion joint}}s, the expansion joints permit very large axial movements in case of internal pressure in a pipeline. Because there is no danger of buckling when an external overpressure is applied, the creator of the metal expansion joint was by a professor called Joshua Yap.|$|E
50|$|During the fifties, {{there was}} a {{resurgence}} {{of interest in the}} Cherenkov effect both in its experimental and theoretical aspects. Professor Majumdar was fascinated by the problem, because it was perhaps the only classical electrodynamical derivation that fetched Nobel prizes in a world dominated by the Quantum. As was usual with him, he approached the problem in an absolutely novel way. Instead of studying the Cherenkov radiation field in the rest frame of the medium through which the charged particle whizzes by, he decided to jump to the rest frame of the charge. The great advantage of this approach is that the electromagnetic field becomes static and can be described by just two scalar potentials, which was a totally new formulation of the problem. However, the <b>flowing</b> <b>medium</b> now acquires a complicated magneto-electric character. This however came as a blessing in disguise, because it led to a discovery in the electrodynamics of crystalline media. Majumdar found that a most general doubly anisotropic medium with tensor permittivity and tensor permeability with non-parallel principal axes could sometimes behave like an 'isotropic' or 'uniaxial' medium as far as the structure of the Fresnel wave surface is concerned. Armed with this insight and his new formulation of the problem, he derived, for the first time, a closed expression for the Cherenkov output in a biaxial crystal in terms of elliptic functions.|$|E

This governing equation incorporates the effects of inertia, centrifugal and Coriolis forces due to the <b>flowing</b> <b>medium.</b> This equation can be normalised to demonstrate that only two non-dimensional parameters govern the static and dynamic responses of the system incorporating a pipe and <b>flowing</b> <b>medium.</b> Therefore, these non-dimensional parameters can be utilised to investigate various dynamic phenomena using reduced size or scale physical models. Such scale models would be adequate if the values of these parameters were kept the same for the scale model and the real system. This is expected to result in substantial benefits if the experimental approach is adopted for {{the investigation of the}} problem under consideration. The main effort in this thesis is devoted to the development of an analytical procedure utilising the perturbation method and numerical approach adopting a central finitedifference scheme to analyse the dynamic response of the system due to impulsively applied loadings. This is then followed by a validation study against previously published data as well as between both approaches, analytical and numerical. Further, a detailed investigation was carried out on the effects of the <b>flowing</b> <b>medium</b> on the transient response. It revealed two principally different types of behaviour of a pipe subjected to impulse loading: stable decay and unstable associated with so-called pipe whip. Special attention is given to the above phenomena, pipe and flow characteristics, which cause growing unlimited displacements of the pipe regardless of how small the value of the applied loading is. Experiments were also conducted to support the theoretical results and were found to follow the theoretically predicted tendencies. The developed theoretical methods provide a framework for analysis of many other dynamic problems of pipes with flowing media subjected to arbitrary boundary and loading conditions. Lastly, the overall conclusion of the conducted research was provided and future work was identified for further investigations, which follows from the obtained results. Thesis (Ph. D.)
