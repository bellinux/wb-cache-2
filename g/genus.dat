5|$|A 2006 {{review of}} Asian nuthatches {{suggested}} {{that there are still}} unresolved problems in nuthatch taxonomy and proposed splitting the <b>genus</b> Sitta. This suggestion would move the red- and yellow-billed south Asian species (velvet-fronted, yellow-billed and sulphur-billed nuthatches) to a new <b>genus,</b> create a third <b>genus</b> for the blue nuthatch, and possibly a fourth for the beautiful nuthatch.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of genera of macroinvertebrates have been {{discovered}} in and around Nescopeck Creek. These consist of one <b>genus</b> of segmented worm, one <b>genus</b> of sowbugs, 11 genera of mayflies, 8 genera of stone flies, 11 genera of caddisflies, 6 genera of dragonflies, 2 genera of helgrammites, 10 genera of beetles, and one <b>genus</b> of fly.|$|E
5|$|Amylostereaceae {{species were}} {{for a long}} time {{classified}} in the <b>genus</b> Stereum, based primary on the layered structure of the fruit body and the similar physiological activity. Mycologist Jacques Boidin separated Amylosterum from Stereum in 1958, justifying this decision by explaining that microscopic differences such as amyloid spores and encrusted cystidia were sufficiently distinct to warrant recognition as a new <b>genus.</b> Although the type species of the <b>genus</b> (today called A.chailletii) was initially named Trichocarpus ambiguus, the name Trichocarpus had already been used for a <b>genus</b> in the flowering plant family Malvaceae. Boidin thus chose the <b>genus</b> name Amylostereum, referring to the amyloid spores.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on recent}} DNA-analysis, the <b>genus</b> Ploceus is almost {{certainly}} polyphyletic. If all species currently included in the <b>genus</b> would remain and the <b>genus</b> would be made monophyletic, {{it would have to}} encompass the entire subfamily Ploceinae. The Ploceinae can be divided into two groups. In the first group, the widowbirds and bishops (<b>genus</b> Euplectes) are sister to a clade in which the genera Foudia and Quelea are closest relatives and which further includes the Asiatic species of Ploceus, i.e. P. manyar, P. philippinus, P. benghalensis, P. megarhynchus, (and P. hypoxanthus, although untested). Since Georges Cuvier picked P. philippinus as the type species, these five species would logically remain assigned to the <b>genus</b> Ploceus.|$|E
5|$|Erythranthe, the monkey-flowers and musk-flowers, is {{a diverse}} plant <b>genus</b> {{with at least}} 111 members (as of 2017) in the family Phrymaceae. Erythranthe was {{originally}} described as a separate <b>genus,</b> then generally regarded as a section within the <b>genus</b> Mimulus, and recently returned to generic rank. Mimulus sect. Diplacus was segregated from Mimulus as a separate <b>genus</b> at the same time. Mimulus remains as a small <b>genus</b> of eastern North America and the Southern Hemisphere. Molecular data show Erythranthe and Diplacus to be distinct evolutionary lines that are distinct from Mimulus as strictly defined.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{were first}} {{documented}} in 1839 by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville when {{he described the}} Masoala fork-marked lemur (P.furcifer) as Lemur furcifer. The holotype {{is thought to be}} MNHN1834-136, a female specimen taken from Madagascar by French naturalist Justin Goudot. The source of this specimen is unknown, but thought to be Antongil Bay. In 1850, Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire moved the fork-marked lemurs to the <b>genus</b> Cheirogaleus (dwarf lemurs), but they were also commonly listed in the <b>genus</b> Microcebus (mouse lemurs). In 1870, John Edward Gray assigned fork-marked lemurs to their own <b>genus,</b> Phaner, after initially including them and the mouse lemurs in the <b>genus</b> Lepilemur (sportive lemurs). Although French naturalist Alfred Grandidier accepted Gray's new <b>genus</b> (while also lumping the other cheirogaleids in Cheirogaleus and illustrating the cranial similarities between cheirogaleids and Lepilemur) in 1897, the <b>genus</b> Phaner was not widely accepted. In the early 1930s, Ernst Schwarz, Guillaume Grandidier, and others resurrected the name, citing characteristics that were intermediate between Cheirogaleus and Microcebus.|$|E
5|$|Hemithrinax is a <b>genus</b> of fan palms {{which are}} endemic to Cuba. Many authors include these {{species in the}} <b>genus</b> Thrinax.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Plantae {{belongs to}} Domain Eukarya and is broken down recursively until each species is {{separately}} classified. The order is: Kingdom; Phylum (or Division); Class; Order; Family; <b>Genus</b> (plural genera); Species. The scientific {{name of a}} plant represents its <b>genus</b> and its species within the <b>genus,</b> resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism. For example, the tiger lily is Lilium columbianum. Lilium is the <b>genus,</b> and columbianum the specific epithet. The combination {{is the name of}} the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in the <b>genus</b> and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not available).|$|E
5|$|Leucothrinax is a {{monotypic}} <b>genus</b> of fan palms {{which is}} native to the northern Caribbean. The species was split from the <b>genus</b> Thrinax after phylogenetic studies showed that its inclusion in Thrinax would render that <b>genus</b> paraphyletic.|$|E
5|$|Palms in the <b>genus</b> Calyptronoma have pinnately {{compound}} {{leaves and}} large, solitary stems 4 to 15 metres (13 to 49ft) tall. The <b>genus</b> is endemic to the Greater Antilles, inhabiting wet areas near streams. Calyptronoma {{is closely related}} to the Central American <b>genus</b> Calyptrogyne.|$|E
5|$|Polioviruses were {{formerly}} {{classified as}} a distinct species belonging to the <b>genus</b> Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae. In 2008, the Poliovirus species was eliminated from the <b>genus</b> Enterovirus and the three serotypes {{were assigned to the}} species Human enterovirus C (later renamed to Enterovirus C), in the <b>genus</b> Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae. The type species of the <b>genus</b> Enterovirus was changed from Poliovirus to (Human) Enterovirus C.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs, {{along with}} several species of brown lemur were once {{included}} in the <b>genus</b> Lemur. In 1962, the ruffed lemurs were reassigned to the <b>genus</b> Varecia.|$|E
5|$|Since 1979, Pachylemur has {{generally}} been regarded as a distinct <b>genus,</b> but some classifications include the <b>genus</b> in Lemur or the ruffed lemur <b>genus</b> Varecia. In a 1982 review, Ian Tattersall recognized two species, Lemur insignis and Lemur jullyi. He did not regard Pachylemur as a distinct <b>genus</b> or even subgenus. As Tattersall noted, Lemur jullyi Standing, 1904, is preoccupied by Palaeochirogalus jullyi Grandidier, 1899, and thus invalid. However, both names are based on material from the central plateau of Madagascar and Tattersall therefore presumed that they {{belong to the same}} species, which he could continue to call Lemur jullyi. Recent classifications recognize Pachylemur as a valid <b>genus</b> with two species—P.insignis (Filhol, 1895) and P.jullyi (Grandidier, 1899)—but express doubt about the distinction between the two species.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} {{is one of the}} New World warblers or wood-warblers in {{the family}} Parulidae. This species was {{originally}} placed under the <b>genus</b> Dendroica. It was recently adjusted {{to be a member of}} <b>genus</b> Setophaga along with all other members of the <b>genus</b> Dendroica, based on the findings from a recent phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA in 2010. The old <b>genus</b> Dendroica was then deleted. Within the <b>genus,</b> it appears to have no particularly close relatives.|$|E
5|$|The brolga was {{formerly}} {{placed in the}} <b>genus</b> Grus but a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the <b>genus,</b> as then defined, was polyphyletic. In the resulting rearrangement to create monophyletic genera, four species, including the brolga, {{were placed in the}} resurrected <b>genus</b> Antigone that had originally been erected by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1853.|$|E
5|$|The {{common toad}} was first given the name Rana bufo by the Swedish {{biologist}} Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae in 1758. In this work, he placed all the {{frogs and toads}} in the single <b>genus</b> Rana. It later became apparent that this <b>genus</b> should be divided, and in 1768, the Austrian naturalist Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti placed the common toad in the <b>genus</b> Bufo, naming it Bufo bufo. The toads in this <b>genus</b> {{are included in the}} family Bufonidae, the true toads.|$|E
5|$|The gadfly petrels, {{so named}} {{due to their}} helter-skelter flight, are the 37 species in the <b>genus</b> Pterodroma and have {{traditionally}} included the two species in the <b>genus</b> Bulweria. The species vary from small to medium sizes, , and are long winged with short hooked bills. The <b>genus</b> Pterodroma is now split into four sub genera, and some species have been split out of the <b>genus</b> (see below).|$|E
5|$|The <b>genus</b> Iridomyrmex {{was first}} {{described}} by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862, {{but it had}} no designated type species until 1903. By then, the type species was designated as Formica detecta, a synonym of Iridomyrmex purpureus. The <b>genus</b> {{was placed in the}} subfamily Dolichoderinae in 1878, the same year the subfamily was established. Since the establishment of the <b>genus,</b> it suffered taxonomic misunderstanding due to the gradual development of unrelated ants being designated into the <b>genus</b> by early researchers who failed to identify easily recognisable features that would make them distinct from the <b>genus</b> Iridomyrmex.|$|E
5|$|The <b>genus</b> Ptyonoprogne {{is closely}} related to the larger swallow <b>genus</b> Hirundo into which it is often subsumed, but a DNA {{analysis}} showed that an enlarged Hirundo <b>genus</b> should contain all the mud-builder genera, including the Delichon house martins, a practice which few authorities follow. Although the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag martins resembles those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow, the research showed that if Delichon, Cecropis and Petrochelidon are split from Hirundo, Ptyonoprogne should be also considered as a separate <b>genus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>genus</b> {{consists}} of seven species and three subspecies {{that were previously}} placed in the <b>genus</b> Iridomyrmex. The <b>genus</b> contains the following species: O. democles, O. epinotalis, O. flavipes, O. glaber, O. punctatissimus, O. sororis and O. vinsoni. The three subspecies classified in this <b>genus</b> are O. glaber clarithorax, O. glaber consimilis and O. glaber sommeri.|$|E
5|$|The {{hooded pitohui}} {{was placed in}} the <b>genus</b> Pitohui with five other species, and the <b>genus</b> was thought to reside within the Australasian {{whistler}} family (Pachycephalidae). A 2008 examination of the <b>genus,</b> however, found it to be polyphyletic (meaning that the <b>genus</b> contained unrelated species), with some purported members of the <b>genus</b> not actually falling within the whistlers. The hooded pitohui and the closely related variable pitohui were both found {{to be related to the}} Old World orioles (Oriolidae). A 2010 study by the same team confirmed that the hooded pitohui and variable pitohui were orioles and indeed were sister species, and that together with the figbirds they formed a well defined basal clade within the family. As the variable pitohui was the type species for the <b>genus</b> Pitohui, the hooded pitohui was retained in that <b>genus</b> and the four remaining species were moved to other genera.|$|E
5|$|The ruffed lemur <b>genus,</b> Varecia, is {{a member}} of the family Lemuridae. The extinct <b>genus,</b> Pachylemur most closely resembled the ruffed lemurs but died out after the arrival of humans. The <b>genus</b> Varecia {{contains}} two species, red ruffed lemurs and black-and-white ruffed lemurs, the latter having three subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow was {{described}} in 1852 by American ornithologist John Cassin as Ammodramus ruficeps. It has also been described as belonging to the <b>genus</b> Peucaea, which contains several sparrows in the <b>genus</b> Aimophila that share characteristics, such as a larger bill and a patch of yellow under the bend of the wing, that {{other members of the}} <b>genus</b> do not. However, splitting the Peucaea sparrows into a separate <b>genus</b> is not generally recognized. A 2008 phylogenetic analysis of the <b>genus</b> Aimophila divided it into four genera, with the rufous-crowned sparrow and its two closest relatives, the Oaxaca sparrow and rusty sparrow, being maintained as the <b>genus</b> Aimophila. In addition, this study suggested that the rufous-crowned sparrow may be more closely related to the brown towhees of the <b>genus</b> Pipilo than {{the other members of the}} historical <b>genus</b> Aimophila.|$|E
5|$|The sarus crane was {{formerly}} {{placed in the}} <b>genus</b> Grus but a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the <b>genus,</b> as then defined, was polyphyletic. In the resulting rearrangement to create monophyletic genera, four species, including the sarus crane, {{were placed in the}} resurrected <b>genus</b> Antigone that had originally been erected by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1853.|$|E
5|$|At least {{thirteen}} insect genera, three spider families, one phalangid (Opiliones), and one mite {{have been}} recorded as predators of the varying stages of L. decemlineata. These include the ground beetle Lebia grandis, the Coccinellid beetles Coleomegilla maculata and Hippodamia convergens, the Shield bugs Perillus bioculatus and Podisus maculiventris, as well as various species of the lacewing <b>genus</b> Chrysopa, the wasp <b>genus</b> Polistes, and the damsel bug <b>genus</b> Nabis.|$|E

5|$|Frigatebirds are unusual among seabirds in {{that they}} often carry blood parasites. Blood-borne {{protozoa}} of the <b>genus</b> Haemoproteus have been recovered from {{four of the five}} species. Bird lice of the ischnoceran <b>genus</b> Pectinopygus and amblyceran <b>genus</b> Colpocephalum and species Fregatiella aurifasciata have been recovered from magnificent and great frigatebirds of the Galapagos Islands. Frigatebirds tended to have more parasitic lice than did boobies analysed in the same study.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Lisa Rosenberger {{published}} a phylogenetic analysis of 14 Dasyatis species, based on morphology. The common stingray {{was reported to}} be the most basal member of the <b>genus,</b> other than the bluespotted stingray (D. kuhlii) and pelagic stingray (D. violacea). However, D. violacea has generally been recognized as belonging to its own <b>genus</b> Pteroplatytrygon, and recently D. kuhlii has also been placed in a different <b>genus,</b> Neotrygon.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{placed in}} the <b>genus</b> Microcebus (mouse lemurs), the giant mouse lemur was moved to its own <b>genus,</b> Mirza, in 1985 due to its larger size, {{morphological}} differences, dental characteristics, and behavior.|$|E
5|$|The <b>genus</b> Ochetellus {{was first}} {{described}} by Steve Shattuck in 1992, {{placing it in}} the subfamily Dolichoderinae. The type species of the <b>genus</b> is Ochetellus glaber, originally described as Hypoclinea glabra by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862. The <b>genus</b> was originally placed in the tribe Dolichoderini. It was later placed under the tribe Iridomyrmecini, now classified as a synonym for the tribe Leptomyrmecini.|$|E
5|$|The <b>genus</b> name Triturus was {{introduced}} in 1815 by the polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, with the northern crested newt (Triturus cristatus) as type species. That species was originally described as Triton cristatus by Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in 1768, but Linnaeus had already used the name Triton for a <b>genus</b> of sea snails ten years before, making a new <b>genus</b> name for the newts necessary.|$|E
5|$|The <b>genus</b> {{name was}} changed to Glyptemys in 2001. The bog turtle and the wood turtle, Glyptemys insculpta, had until then been {{included}} in the <b>genus</b> Clemmys, which also included spotted turtles (C.guttata) and western pond turtles (C.marmorata). Nucleotide sequencing and ribosomal DNA analyses suggested that bog turtles and wood turtles are closely related, but neither is directly related to spotted turtles, hence the separation of the <b>genus</b> Glyptemys.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of an}} organism is generated from its <b>genus</b> and species. For example, humans are listed as Homo sapiens. Homo is the <b>genus,</b> and sapiens the species. When writing the {{scientific name}} of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the <b>genus</b> and put all of the species in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.|$|E
5|$|Transandinomys is a <b>genus</b> of rodents in {{the tribe}} Oryzomyini of family Cricetidae. It {{includes}} two species—T.bolivaris and T.talamancae—found in forests from Honduras in Central America {{south and east}} to southwestern Ecuador and northwestern Venezuela in northern South America. Until 2006, its members {{were included in the}} <b>genus</b> Oryzomys, but phylogenetic analysis showed that they are not closely related to the type species of that <b>genus,</b> and they have therefore been placed in a new <b>genus.</b> They may be most closely related to genera like Hylaeamys and Euryoryzomys, which contain very similar species. Both species of Transandinomys have had eventful taxonomic histories.|$|E
5|$|Urnula craterium {{was first}} {{described}} in 1822 by American botanist Lewis David de Schweinitz as Peziza craterium, {{based on a}} specimen found in North Carolina. The species {{first appeared in the}} scientific literature under its current name when Elias Magnus Fries described the new <b>genus</b> Urnula in 1849, and set Peziza craterium as the type species. In 1896, German mycologist Heinrich Rehm removed the species from Urnula – transferring it to the <b>genus</b> Geopyxis – and replaced the type species with Urnula terrestris, a peripherally related species. This restructuring resulted in a taxomically untenable situation in which the <b>genus</b> Urnula consisted of a single species with ambiguous resemblance to the original species (described by Fries) upon which the <b>genus</b> was based. According to Elsie Kupfer, who had written Rehm to clarify the rationale for his decision: Urnula craterium was placed with its related species under Geopyxis, because Geopyxis was established by Persoon before Urnula by Fries; and that in order to retain the <b>genus</b> Urnula, under which Saccardo had placed Podophacidium terrestre of Niessl, he (Rehm) restricted the <b>genus</b> to this latter fungus.|$|E
25|$|The <b>genus</b> Zaprionus was {{described}} in 1902 by Daniel William Coquillett. He considered the <b>genus</b> {{closely related to the}} <b>genus</b> Drosophila. Molecular studies have confirmed this relationship, and the <b>genus</b> Zaprionus is positioned within the paraphyletic <b>genus</b> Drosophila.|$|E
