Poor monomer purity quickly leads to early termination, and solvent polarity has a great effect on reaction rate. Loosely-coordinated and solvated ion pairs promote more reactive, fast-polymerizing chains, unencumbered by their counterions. Unfortunately, molecules that are polar enough to support these solvated ion pairs often interrupt the polymerization in other ways, such as by destroying propagating species or coordinating with initiator ions, {{and so they are}} seldom utilized.

By adding styrene monomer to a solution of sodium naphthalenide and THF, the [...] "olive-green" [...] solution became a [...] "cherry-red" [...] and appeared to continue to react with new additions of styrene even minutes after the last. This observation, coupled with the determination that the product was polystyrene, indicated that a living, anionic polymerization had been initiated {{by the addition of}} electrons.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ionic</b> <b>polymerization</b> {{in which}} the active centers are anions.Note 1: The anions may be free, paired, or aggregated.Modified from the earlier definition. Penczek S.; Moad, G. Pure Appl. Chem., Anionic {{addition}} polymerization {{is a form of}} chain-growth polymerization or addition polymerization that involves the polymerization of vinyl monomers with strong electronegative groups. This polymerization is carried out through a carbanion active species. Like all chain-growth polymerizations, it takes place in three steps: chain initiation, chain propagation, and chain termination. Living polymerizations, which lack a formal termination pathway, occur in many anionic addition polymerizations. The advantage of living anionic addition polymerizations is that they allow for the control of structure and composition.|$|E
5000|$|Because of the {{polarity}} of {{the active}} group on each polymerizing radical, termination by chain combination is not seen in <b>ionic</b> <b>polymerization.</b> Furthermore, because charge propagation can only occur by covalent bond formation with the compatible monomer species, termination by chain transfer or disproportionation is impossible. This means that all polymerizing ions, unlike in radical polymerization, grow and maintain their chain lengths throughout the reaction duration (so-called [...] "living" [...] polymer chains), until termination {{by the addition of}} a terminating molecule such as water. This leads to virtually monodisperse polymer products, which have many applications in material analysis and product design. Furthermore, because the ions do not self-terminate, block copolymers may be formed by the addition of a new monomer species.|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) which, unlike living <b>ionic</b> <b>polymerizations,</b> is remarkably tolerant of functional groups. 1, 2 With regard to hydrophilic monomers, Matyjaszewski and co-workers have reported the well-controlled (co) polymerization of 2 -hydroxyethyl acrylate 3 in aqueous media at 90 °C, 2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate 4 at 23 °C in bulk or nonaqueous media, and 4 -vinylpyridine 5 in alcoholic media at 40 °C. We have recently described the facile polymerization of monomethoxy-capped oligo(ethylene oxide) methacrylate 6 [OEGMA] in aqueous media at 20 °C using a similar protocol. ATRP of acidic monomers have generally proved more problematic. For some time, {{it was believed that}} protecting group strategies were necessary since carboxylic acid-based monomers such as methacrylic acid or acrylic acid formed insoluble complexes with the copper catalyst if ATRP was attempted in nonaqueous media. 7 However, we recently demonstrated that methacrylic acid 8 could be polymerized directly in its sodium salt form by ATRP in aqueous solution. Although an important “proof of concept” experiment, the conversion of sodium methacrylate to polymer was both slow and substantially incomplete, with yields of only 70 − 80 % being obtained after 21 h at 90 °C. Herein we describe the efficient, well-controlled (co) polymerization of a second acidic monomer, sodium 4 -vinylbenzoate [NaVBA], via ATRP in aqueous media (see Figure 1).

50|$|As with radical polymerization, {{reactions}} are initiated by a reactive compound. For cationic polymerization, titanium-, boron-, aluminum-, and tin-halide complexes with water, alcohols, or oxonium salts are useful as initiators, {{as well as}} strong acids and salts such as KHSO4. Meanwhile, group 1 metals such as lithium, sodium, and potassium, and their organic compounds (e.g. sodium naphthalene) serve as effective anionic initiators. In both anionic and cationic polymerization, each charged chain end (negative and positive, respectively) is matched by a counterion of opposite charge that originates from the initiator. Because of the charge stability necessary in <b>ionic</b> <b>polymerization,</b> monomers which may be polymerized by this method are few compared to those available for free radical polymerization. Stable polymerizing cations are only possible using monomers with electron-releasing groups, and stable anions with monomers with electron-withdrawing substituents.|$|E
50|$|The {{adjective}} ‘controlled’ {{indicates that}} a certain kinetic feature of a polymerization or structural aspect of the polymer molecules formed is controlled (or both).

All these and further controlled polymerizations are included in the class of reversible-deactivation radical polymerizations.

However, the industrial applications of <b>ionic</b> <b>polymerization</b> are limited due {{to the need for}} rigorous polymerization conditions, such as highly purified monomers and solvents. In addition, living <b>ionic</b> <b>polymerization</b> can only be used to polymerize hydrocarbon monomers and the polar monomer due to unwanted side reactions. Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is an alternative polymerization technique to improve polymer architectures under simple polymerization conditions in the presence of hydrophilic organic/inorganic fillers such as layered silicates and graphene oxide (GO) [15, 16]. The direct growth of thermoresponsive poly- 2 -(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate polymer brushes with narrow PDI through surface-initiated highly controlled ATRP from initiator functionalized graphene sheets has been reported, where the polymers were grown directly from a graphene surface with covalent functionalization to tune the physical, thermal, and electrical properties [17]. Pyrene-based functionalized graphene has been used for reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of dimethyl aminoethyl acrylate, acrylic acid, and styrene in order to avoid graphene aggregation [18]. The efficient functionalization through diazotization of graphene for ATRP of styrene results in high-performance polymer-graphene nanocomposites with increased tensile strength, Tg and Young's modulus [19]. Covalently bounded polystyrene polymer chains have been systematically tuned using ATRP on single-layer graphene nanosheets by Fang et al. [20].

After a small perturbation of relative amplitude, e. g. a small temperature jump, this balance is destroyed: the velocity acquires a boost greatly exceeding its tiny equilibrium value. For > c ≈ 1 /N̄ 1 / 2 the response has 3 stages: (1) Coherent chain growth or shrinkage, leaving a highly non-linear hole or peak in the MWD at small chain lengths.

Self-seeding lead to similar crystal sizes specifically in dilute growth conditions. To some extent, the self-nucleation process {{can control the}} final crystal size by controlling {{the population of the}} seeds through the self-seeding temperature [8]. The thickness of the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) crystal layer in the block copolymer single crystals changes with the crystallization temperature, and this affects the conformation of the amorphous chains. Since amorphous chains are tethered to the crystal layer surface, they are considered to be polymer brushes. Demanded block copolymers to fabricate single crystals with predetermined molecular weight could be prepared by living <b>polymerization</b> methods (e.g., <b>ionic</b> or radical <b>polymerization).</b> Because for developing homogeneous and uniform amorphous brushes the primary constituent chains should resemble each other length wise (i.e., narrow polydispersity). Uniform brushes developed by this approach cannot be realized by traditional methods for polymer brush fabrication. This method forms a film which is attached to a substrate by covalent bonding. When a long block such as atactic polystyrene (PS) chain is attached to a crystalline PEG chain, the big chain ends are excluded from the crystal lattice and they accumulate onto the crystalline substrate surface developing polymer brushes [7, 9]. Polymer mixed-brushes having various surface morphologies, just like homo-brush single crystals, are composed of sandwich structure [10, 11], i.e., a PEG nano-layer sandwiched between two amorphous nano-layers.|$|R
