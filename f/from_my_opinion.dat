The consequence of that inquiry was, that we began to conceive a very bad opinion both of the complainant and defendant in that business,--that we found the English justice to be, as we thought it, and reported it to the House, a grievance, instead of a redress, to the people of India. I could bring before your Lordships, if I did not spare your patience, whole volumes of reports, whole bodies of evidence, which, in the progress we have made in the course of eight or nine years, brought to my mind such a conviction as will never be torn from my heart but with my life; and I should have no heart that was fit to lodge any honest sentiment, if I departed <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> upon that occasion.

30|$|Since the {{tax system}} reform in 1994, {{business}} tax {{has long been a}} main and sustainable source of local tax revenue. However, as the reform program to replace the business tax with a value-added tax progresses, local governments will soon lose their main tax. In order to enhance the local governments’ ability in providing basic public services, it is imperative to seek new main taxes. The central task of improving the local tax system is the establishment of main tax. A main tax shall generally meet the following criteria: (1) a main tax should contribute a large proportion to the overall local fiscal income, (2) a main tax should be a sustainable source of tax revenue, and (3) a main tax should be able to enhance local governments’ abilities in providing basic public services. <b>From</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> as business tax is soon fading away, finding an alternative main tax should follow two steps.

40|$|The {{modern day}} {{brings with it}} many risks for paramedics {{in the form of}} higher agression from the side of people they {{interact}} with. More and more often, members of rescue teams are encountering verbal and physical abuse from the side of patients and their relatives. The frequence of treating people intoxicated with alcohol or other narcotics, which makes them dangerous for the paramedics, is rising. Therefore, situations for which the paramedics weren't trained or sufficiently geared are occuring. In the theoretical part of this paper i am talking about problems with agression in a pre-hospital care, mainly with how it manifests, the reason why and the types of it. Because the verbal abuse was voted by participants as the most common, i decided to devote a part of the theoretical paper to the ways how to properly communicate with an agressive person. Then i include a few marginal information about self-defence and rules for tactful self-defence. Because paramedics are completely unequipped for physical attack, i talk about this problem from the technical, physical and legal side. I am gathering data for the research part of the paper from paramedics through series of half-structured interviews. I study how they act in times of crisis such as when they are attacked. I also mention what level of knowledge of self-defence there paramedics possess and if they use some techniques from it. The result of my paper is pointing out that the paramedics aren't at a level of self-defence when they can effectively protect themselves from harm during an actual physical attack. A police department of Czech Republic is absolutely necessary for ZSS squads for dealing with these situations. The research showed, that the training in self-defence and cooperation with PČR ideally once per year would be greatly appreciated by most of the paramedics, and <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> it would be great way to deal with situations that can occur in the future...|$|E

Za tímto účelem jsem zkoumal ze západoevropských konsociačních demokracií Rakousko, Nizozemí, Belgii a Švýcarsko, a z východoevropskýchjsem se zaměřil na Bosnu a Hercegovinu, Kypr a Makedonii. V první kapitole jsem se věnoval samotné teorii konsociační demokracie a podmínkám, které tato teorie označuje za vhodné, další kapitoly se věnovaly samotným konsociačním demokraciím a závěrečná kapitola měla analytický rozměr. V této kapitole jsem ukázal, jak se společensko-politické podmínky lišily na západě a na východě Evropy, a jaký vliv to mělo na funkčnost tohoto modelu demokracie. Katedra politologie a mezinárodních vztahůObhájenoIn my {{bachelor}} thesis, I {{was interested}} in which way socio-political conditions influence the functioning of consociational democracy and how these socio-political conditions differ in countries of western Europe and eastern Europe, in which was consociational democracy used. For this purpose I have chosen four west-european and three east-european countries. From west-european countries I pay attention at Austria, Netherlands, Switzerland and Belgium. From east-european then at Bosnia and Herzeg, Cyprus and Macedonia. At first I focused on the theory of consociational democracy. On that, how this type of democracy arise, what consociational democracy is at all, which signs are characteristic for consociational democracy and which socio-political conditions are favourable for consociatinal democracy according its author Arend Lijphart. In chapters about countries I focus on the form of consociational democracy and socio-political conditions in given countries. In final chapter I analyze socio-political conditions in all countries and I came to the conclusion, that these conditions are very different in western and eastern Europe. <b>From</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> and I wrote it in my thesis, they are different to the size, that it has key influence on succesfull or unsuccesfull functioning of consociational democracy. The main differences, which I recognize during writing my thesis, are tradition of consensual behavior (on the West of Europe it is, on the East of Europe not), existence of external threat (in western Europe) or internal threat (in eastern Europe), then the fact, that consociational democracy in the eastern Europe was forced from international surroundings (in western Europe it was by natural way) and {{we can say that}} different were also relationships between groups in societies. In eastern Europe they were sometimes really hostile. Hypothesis of my work was that socio-political conditions in western and in eastern Europe are different and they are different to the size that they are decisive for success of aplication of consociational democracy.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to screen the main methods for the {{synthesis}} of conjugated polymers for their suitability {{in the preparation of}} conductive polymer brushes. The main focus was put on the grafting of intrinsically soluble substituted regioregular polyalkylthiophenes because of their excellent optoelectronic properties. The resulting polymer films were characterized and their optoelectrical properties studied. For the first time, a synthesis of conductive polymer brushes on solid substrates using “grafting-from” method was performed. The most important, <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> finding of this work is that regioregular head-to-tail poly- 3 -alkylthiophenes – benchmark materials for organic electronics - can be now selectively grafted from appropriately-terminated surfaces to produce polymer brushes of otherwise soluble polymers - the architecture earlier accessible only in the case of non-conductive polymers. In particular, we developed a new method to grow P 3 ATs via Kumada Catalyst Transfer Polymerization (KCTP) of 2 -bromo- 5 -chloromagnesio- 3 -alkylthiophene. Exposure of the initiator layers to monomer solutions leads to selective chain-growth polycondensation of the monomers from the surface, resulting into P 3 AT brushes in a very economical way. The grafting process was investigated in detail and the structure of the resulting composite films was elucidated using several methods. The obtained data suggests that the grafting process occurs not only at the poly(4 -bromstyrene) (PS-Br) /polymerization solution interface, but also deeply inside the swollen PS-Br films, penetrable for the catalyst and for the monomer The grafting process was investigated in detail and the structure of the resulting composite film was elucidated using ellipsometry, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS), and Conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM). The obtained data suggests that the grafting process occurs not only at the poly(4 -bromostyrene), PS-Br/polymerization solution interface, but also deeply inside the swollen PS-Br film, which is penetrable for the catalyst and the monomer. The process results in an interpenetrated PS-Br/P 3 HT network, in which relatively short poly(3 -hexylthiophene), P 3 HT grafts emanate from long, cross-linked PS-Br chains. A further method investigated during our work was to covalently graft regioirregular P 3 HT to substrates modified by macromolecular anchors using oxidative polymerization of 3 HT with FeCl 3. P 3 HT layers with variable thicknesses from 30 nm up to 200 nm were produced using two steps of polymerization reaction. The P 3 HT obtained by oxidative polymerization had always an irregular structure, which was a result of the starting monomer being asymmetric, which is undesired for electronic applications. The third method for the production of conductive polymer brushes was to graft regioregular poly(3, 3 ''-dioctyl-[2, 2 '; 5 ', 2 '']terthiophene) (PDOTT) by electrochemical oxidative polycondensation of symmetrically substituted 3, 3 ''-dioctyl-[2, 2 '; 5 ', 2 '']terthiophene (DOTT). A modification of the supporting ITO electrode by the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of compounds having polymerizable head-groups with properly adjusted oxidative potentials was found to be essential to achieve a covalent attachment of PDOTT chains. The polymer films produced show solvatochromism and electrochromism, as well as the previous two methods. After polymerization, the next step towards building organic electronic devices is applying the methods obtained in nano- and microscale production. Block copolymers constitute an attractive option for such surface-engineering, due to their ability to form a variety of nanoscale ordered phase-separated structures. However, block copolymers containing conjugated blocks are less abundant compared to their non-conjugated counterparts. Additionally, their phase behaviour at surfaces is not always predictable. We demonstrated in this work, how surface structures of non-conductive block copolymers, such as P 4 VP-b-PS-I, can be converted into (semi) conductive P 4 VP-b-PS-graft-P 3 HT chains via a surface-initiated polymerization of P 3 HT (Kumada Catalyst Transfer Polymerization (KCTP) from reactive surface-grafted block copolymers. This proves that our method is applicable to develop structured brushes of conductive polymers. We believe that it can be further exploited for novel, stimuli-responsive materials, for the construction of sensors, or for building various opto-electronic devices. The methods developed here can in principle be adapted for the preparation of any conductive block copolymers and conductive polymers, including other interesting architectures of conductive polymers, such as block copolymers, cylindrical brushes, star-like polymers, etc. To this end, one needs to synthesize properly-designed and multi-functional Ni-initiators before performing the polycondensation...|$|E
