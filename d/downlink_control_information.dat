40|$|Abstract—A recent idea of {{exploiting}} the promised gains of multi-user MIMO for future cellular standards as LTE by intel-ligent interference aware receivers instead of suboptimal single-user receivers is quite promising. However this detection strategy {{is based on}} the exploitation of the structure of interference which necessitates the knowledge of the constellation and precoder of the co-scheduled user equipment (UE). As the <b>downlink</b> <b>control</b> <b>information</b> (DCI) in LTE is devoid of this information, we look in this paper at the sensitivity of LTE’s multi-user MIMO mode to the information of co-scheduled UE. We show that {{exploiting the}} discrete nature of interference {{in the absence of the}} exact knowledge of interference constellation has significant gains as compared to the suboptimal single-user detection. To this end, we propose a blind receiver for LTE which shows significantly improved performance as compared to single-user receivers and exhibits a minor degradation as compared to interference aware receivers...|$|E

By dynamically separating the MUE and HUE PRB assignments, enhanced shadow chasing can better constrain the downlink interference to the MUE.

There have been several efforts aimed at having mobile devices equipped with multiple interfaces connect optimally to the access network that minimizes their power consumption.

Only with the information encoded and encrypted in the MIB and SIB messages an attacker would be able to aim to the UL control channels with a jamming charge. Full application of such security solutions render a jamming attack to be only as effective as basic barrage jamming.

30|$|One {{major problem}} in using the type II relay in uplink data {{retransmission}} [10, 11] {{is caused by the}} backward compatibility requirement. As specified in LTE-Advanced specifications, when a legacy UE has both <b>control</b> <b>information</b> (e.g., ACK/NACK, periodic channel quality indicator (CQI) report, etc.), and data to be transmitted in the uplink, the UE should embed the <b>control</b> <b>information</b> in the data transmission in order to retain the single carrier-frequency division multiple access characteristics and to reduce peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Such a transmission requirement, i.e., embedding <b>control</b> <b>information</b> in data, brings difficulty for type II relay-assisted cooperative retransmission, where type II relay monitors initial transmission of the UE and performs cooperative transmission to assist retransmission of UE when the initial transmission is failed. We assume that the UE has <b>control</b> <b>information</b> (e.g., ACK/NACK to different downlink data packets) to be transmitted at both initial transmission and retransmission. For simplicity, we denote the <b>control</b> <b>information</b> embedded in initial transmission as “old” <b>control</b> <b>information</b> and the <b>control</b> <b>information</b> embedded in retransmission as “new” <b>control</b> <b>information.</b> The type II relay can only know the old <b>control</b> <b>information</b> through monitoring and detecting the initial transmission but cannot know the new <b>control</b> <b>information</b> to be transmitted by the UE in advance before the retransmission. Therefore, type II relay will have difficulty in performing the retransmission. If the type II relay sends exactly the same signals as the initial transmission of the UE, i.e., with the old <b>control</b> <b>information,</b> the old <b>control</b> <b>information</b> from the relay and the new <b>control</b> <b>information</b> from the UE will collide at the eNodeB. If the relay punctures the old <b>control</b> <b>information</b> in cooperative retransmission, the eNodeB receives the <b>control</b> <b>information</b> only from the UE but a superposed reference signal from both the relay and the UE. Consequently, channel estimation mismatch occurs for the <b>control</b> <b>information</b> and results in unacceptable detection performance of the <b>control</b> <b>information.</b>|$|R

To be more specific, the received reference signal at the eNodeB is a superposed signal from both the UE and relay.
