500|$|Although {{the focus}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> is {{largely on the}} {{character}} of Prince Hamlet, Hazlitt also comments on the movement of the dramatic action. Shakespeare lends all the characters and settings an air of verisimilitude, so that the reader might consider [...] "the whole play [...] an exact transcription of what might be supposed to have taken place at the court of Denmark, at the remote period of time fixed upon, before the modern refinements in morals and manners were heard of. [...] the characters think and speak and act just as they might do, if left entirely to themselves. There is no set purpose, no straining at a point." ...|$|E
500|$|Once again, as John Kinnaird observed, Hazlitt is here {{far more}} than a [...] "character critic", showing serious {{interest}} {{in the structure of the}} play as a whole. [...] "The whole of the trial-scene", he remarks <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay,</b> [...] "is a master-piece of dramatic skill. The legal acuteness, the passionate declamations, the sound maxims of jurisprudence, the wit and irony interspersed in it, the fluctuations of hope and fear in the different persons, and the completeness and suddenness of the catastrophe, cannot be surpassed". He points to some beautiful poetic passages, and concludes that [...] "the graceful winding up of this play [...] is one of the happiest instances of Shakespear's knowledge of the principles of the drama".|$|E
500|$|Hazlitt's {{enthusiastic}} {{explanation of}} how Falstaff's fatness contributes to our amused sympathy with him was later especially admired by the critic John Dover Wilson. And John Kinnaird considered the [...] "sketch of Falstaff" [...] <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> to be a [...] "masterpiece", [...] "a brilliant [...] portrait of comic exuberance incarnate", though perhaps in part a creation of his own imagination rather than being entirely faithful to the character as created by Shakespeare. More recently the critic Harold Bloom, in a book devoted entirely to Falstaff, approvingly noted Hazlitt's appreciative commentary on the character, quoting Hazlitt's observation that Falstaff [...] "lives in a perpetual holiday and open house, and we live {{with him in a}} round of invitations to a rump and dozen." ...|$|E

500|$|John Kinnaird {{also paid}} {{particular}} attention to Hazlitt's [...] "celebrated" [...] sketch of Prince Hamlet <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay.</b> Although Hazlitt does not entirely belong to the school of pure [...] "character" [...] critics, this essay does {{tend to be more}} of a [...] "character" [...] criticism than others, asserts Kinnaird, because Hazlitt shared with his Romantic contemporaries an [...] "ambivalence toward tragedy". Hamlet to him as to his contemporaries was a modern character who was [...] "obsessed with evil in the world [...] long to escape from knowledge of it in themselves [...] pessimistic sense that suffering changes nothing and that the world must go on as it is." [...] Thus, Hazlitt could declare, [...] "It is we who are Hamlet." ...|$|E

2500|$|John Kinnaird {{suggests}} that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay,</b> Hazlitt, with his [...] "penetration" [...] and [...] "characteristically ruthless regard for truth", in his reference to Irving's [...] "portentous obliquity of vision" [...] insinuates that [...] "one eye of Irving's imagination ... {{looks up to}} a wrathful God cast in his own image, 'endowed with all his own ... irritable humours in an infinitely exaggerated degree' [...] the other is always squinting askew at the prestigious image of Edward Irving reflected in the gaze of his fashionable audience—and especially in the rapt admiration of the 'female part of his congregation'".|$|E
2500|$|Writing {{a century}} and a half later, critic John Kinnaird observes that Hazlitt was [...] "Scott's {{greatest}} contemporary critic" [...] and wrote the first important criticism of the novel, particularly in the form it was then beginning to assume.

Earlier, even to an extent <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay,</b> he had downplayed the novels as being little more than a transcription from old chronicles.
