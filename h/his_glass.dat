25|$|Martha {{moved in}} with Eads' parents in LeClaire, Iowa while Eads stayed behind in St. Louis {{to set up a}} glass works. Although their living {{arrangement}} was supposed to be temporary, the failure of <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> business made it permanent. Eads had many debts to pay off from the failed business and he went back to working in salvage.|$|E
60|$|Mr. McCall {{read this}} epic through, {{then he looked}} at his son. He first looked at him over <b>his</b> <b>glasses,</b> then through <b>his</b> <b>glasses,</b> then over <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> again, then through <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> once more. A curious {{expression}} was in his eyes. If such a thing had not been so impossible, one would have said that his gaze had in it something of respect, of admiration, even of reverence.|$|R
40|$|He {{sits down}} at the desk, tears {{a sheet of paper}} out of a tablet, picks up a pencil, and commences. After commencing for some twenty minutes he decides that he should un-commence long enough to decide upon a subject upon which he can commence, Another twenty minutes pass during which he systemazically breaks the lead of his pencil, sharpens his pencil, turns the radio on, turns the radio off, takes his shoes off, puts his shoes on, musses up his hair, combs his hair, loosens his necktie, takes his necktie off, takes off <b>his</b> <b>glasses,</b> twirls <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> around <b>his</b> finger, walks across the room and picks up <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> from the floor, cleans <b>his</b> <b>glasses,</b> puts on <b>his</b> <b>glasses,</b> sneezes, takes out his handkerchief, cleans <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> again, files <b>his</b> finger nails, doodles away three sheets of paper, and groans. In fact he does {{everything}} except [...] . decide upon a subject...|$|R

25|$|We {{were alone}} {{together}} among the strange poisons, {{each one of}} whom, with a quicker or a slower death-devil in his eye, sat in <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> or porcelain sentry-box, a living force of bale. Should it be Hemp? No, that was too slow, uncertain, painful. Morphine? Too many antidotes — too much commonness, ostentation in that. Daturin? I {{did not like to}} ask how much of that was certain...|$|E
25|$|Jenny (Daisy Turner) starts {{corresponding}} with a {{man named}} David Cox on a social networking website. Jenny meets David in the woods, where he is revealed to be Silas. They have a picnic and when Silas sees Jenny drugging <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> of wine, he secretly swaps them. Silas sees Jenny searching through his bag and threatens her, causing her to run away. She becomes drowsy and falls to the ground. Silas strangles Jenny to death and takes the ring from her finger, before burying her body in the woods. Silas takes a dislike to Riley's fiancé, Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), after he learns of her promiscuity. Silas attempts and fails to attack Mercedes with a candlestick when her back is turned.|$|E
25|$|Wolfe {{maintains}} a rigid schedule in the brownstone. He has breakfast {{in his bedroom}} while wearing yellow silk pajamas; he hates to discuss work during breakfast, and if forced to do so insists upon not uttering a word until he has finished <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> of orange juice (Murder by the Book). Afterwards, he is with Horstmann in the plant rooms from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Lunch is usually at 1:15p.m. He returns to the plant rooms from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Dinner is generally at 7:15 or 7:30p.m. (although in one book, Wolfe tells a guest that lunch is served at 1 o'clock and dinner at 8). The remaining hours, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., and after dinner, are available for business, or for reading {{if there is no}} pressing business (even if, by Archie's lights, there is). Sunday's schedule is more relaxed; Theodore, the orchid-keeper, usually goes out.|$|E

In order to cover {{for the fact that}} he accidentally broke <b>his</b> <b>glasses,</b> Ralphie tells <b>his</b> mother that a falling icicle was responsible for the accident. His mother, not having seen what actually happened, believes him.|$|R

25|$|Assembling the {{suspects}} together along with Carla, Poirot makes his denouement about the murder. Although Phillip's hostility to Caroline {{was due to}} her rejection of his love for her, and Meredith's sympathy was due to his weariness for his long affection for her, leading him to form an attachment to Elsa that was unreciprocated, both brothers' emotions were merely red herrings. In putting together the case, he reveals that Caroline had been innocent, but did not defend herself in court, because she believed that Angela had committed the murder; the evidence Poirot had uncovered showed that her younger sister had been angry with Amyas and had put salt in <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> as a prank. She {{had the opportunity to}} steal the poison from Meredith {{on the morning of the}} crime, and was seen fiddling with the bottle of beer that Caroline would take down to him. However, Caroline did not wish her sister to be charged for the crime, having felt a deep guilt for injuring her sister in a fit of jealous rage many years ago, which had left Angela blinded in one eye and with a permanent scar on the left side of her face. Therefore, she took steps to take the blame for her crime in order to earn redemption, which explained why she did not claim she was innocent in the letter she sent Angela but believed Angela knew Caroline was. However, Poirot reveals that Caroline's actions had actually proved her innocence, as she had wiped the fingerprints off the bottle because she believed that the poison had been put in it rather than in the glass, and that she would have no need to remove her own--thus, she was removing those of a third party. Furthermore, he reveals that Angela was not the killer, as she had been at Meredith's lab in order to steal valerian from him in preparation for playing another prank on Amyas, but never carried out the act because of the murder, deducing this from the way that she spoke of the theft in the future tense to Poirot.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 19th century, glass blowers were {{difficult}} to find. Belgium was the largest exporter of window glass to the United States, and plant manager Heagany previously used the skills of glass blowers from that country in his Kokomo glass works. [...] In Hartford City, Heagany again relied upon Belgian workers for the skilled positions in <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> works.|$|E
500|$|... "Time Will Crawl" [...] was {{performed}} live in 1987 on all dates of <b>his</b> <b>Glass</b> Spider Tour, later released on the deluxe edition of Glass Spider (2007). That same year, Bowie also made an appearance during BBC's [...] "Top of the Pops", but his performance was ultimately not aired on television {{due to the}} song leaving the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart at that time. However, his performance was later uploaded onto YouTube.|$|E

500|$|Bowie {{wrote the}} album's lead track [...] "Day-In Day-Out" [...] {{because of his}} concern about the {{treatment}} of the homeless in the US, and he wanted to make a statement about it. Some networks banned the song's video, which Bowie found ludicrous. This track was also the lead single for the album. A version of the song sung in Spanish was recorded to promote Bowie's first-ever concerts in Spain during <b>his</b> <b>Glass</b> Spider Tour was released {{for the first time in}} 2007 when the [...] was released digitally.|$|E
500|$|Newsreels of {{the final}} {{featured}} post-match toasts by the two captains. First Dixie Dean, raising <b>his</b> <b>glass,</b> said [...] "Here's to Lancashire, and may the cup stay in Lancashire. If Everton don't win it, may another Lancashire club win it." [...] Cowan replied [...] "I hope the next Lancashire club that wins it is Manchester City, my club". The following year's final made the captains' remarks look perceptive. Cowan and his Manchester City team returned, and beat Portsmouth 2–1 to win the 1934 cup. Both Manchester City and Everton also {{went on to win}} the league championship later in the decade; Manchester City in 1937, and Everton in 1939.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Millennium Park {{officials}} {{and a group}} of art collectors, curators and architects reviewed the artistic works of 30different artists and asked two for proposals. American artist Jeff Koons submitted a proposal to erect a permanent [...] sculpture of a playground slide; <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> and steel design featured an observation deck [...] above the ground that was accessible via an elevator. The committee chose the second design by internationally acclaimed artist Anish Kapoor. Measuring [...] and weighing , the proposal featured a seamless, stainless steel surface inspired by liquid mercury. This mirror-like surface would reflect the Chicago skyline, but its elliptical shape would distort and twist the reflected image. As visitors walk around the structure, its surface acts like a fun-house mirror as it distorts their reflections.|$|E
500|$|Frederick {{conducted}} a perfunctory reconnaissance of his enemy's position, {{accompanied by a}} forest ranger and an officer who had previously been stationed in Frankfurt. He also consulted a peasant who, though garrulous, was uninformed about military needs: the peasant told the King that a natural obstacle between the Red Grange (a large farmstead between Kunersdorf and Frankfurt's outer city) and Kunersdorf was unpassable; what the peasant did not know was that the Russians had been there long enough to construct a causeway linking these two sections. [...] Looking to the east through his telescope, Frederick saw some wooded hills, called the Reppen Forest, and he believed he could use them to screen an advance, much like he had done at Leuthen. [...] He did not send scouts to reconnoiter the land or question locals about {{the ground in the}} forest. [...] Furthermore, through <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> he could see that the Russians were facing west and north, and their fortifications were stronger on the west. He decided that all the Allies were facing northwest and that the forest was readily passable.|$|E
500|$|In a contributor's note Salinger gave to Harper's Magazine in 1946, he wrote: [...] "I {{almost always}} write about very young people", a {{statement}} that {{has been referred to}} as his credo. Adolescents are featured or appear in all of Salinger's work, from his first published short story, [...] "The Young Folks" [...] (1940), to The Catcher in the Rye and <b>his</b> <b>Glass</b> family stories. In 1961, the critic Alfred Kazin explained that Salinger's choice of teenagers as a subject matter was one reason for his appeal to young readers, but another was [...] "a consciousness [...] that he speaks for them and virtually to them, in a language that is peculiarly honest and their own, with a vision of things that capture their most secret judgments of the world." [...] For this reason, Norman Mailer once remarked that Salinger was [...] "the greatest mind ever to stay in prep school". Salinger's language, especially his energetic, realistically sparse dialogue, was revolutionary at the time his first stories were published and was seen by several critics as [...] "the most distinguishing thing" [...] about his work.|$|E

[...] The extroverted, Americanized woman {{is not what}} Wang has in mind for his elder son, and Wang and Ta argue. [...] Sammy Fong arrives and quickly penetrates Linda's scheme: Linda, frustrated by the five years she has been seeing Sammy, is determined to marry someone, and if Sammy won't step forward, she will settle for Ta. [...] Sammy quickly strikes back by inviting the Wangs, Mei Li and her father to watch the show at his [...] "Celestial Bar" [...] ("Fan Tan Fannie"). [...] Linda does her striptease, realizing too late who is sitting at the best table. [...] Sammy's special guests storm out, except for Ta, who is so humiliated {{that he does not}} know what to do. [...] He is led away by childhood friend Helen Chao, a seamstress who fits Linda's costumes for her, and whose love for Ta is unrequited. [...] Linda, goaded beyond endurance when Sammy raises <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> to her, dumps a champagne bucket over his head.|$|E
