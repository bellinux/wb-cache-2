5|$|Mirror's Edge {{takes place}} in a 'utopian' city where life is {{comfortable}} and crime almost non-existent. But the city's state of bliss is the achievement of a domineering and totalitarian military regime which monitors all communication, controls the media, spies on its citizens and has policies which include the outright prohibition of smoking and alcohol. The City also operates sham trials and runs on a sham democracy. Eighteen years before the events of the game, they had opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> protest against their rule, killing many civilians.|$|E

5|$|On October 15, 1976, an {{arsonist}} lit a <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> subway {{train at}} Christie station. The fire destroyed four subway cars and some wall tiles, {{and resulted in}} {{a section of the}} subway being closed for a few days. On September 19, 2007, the station modernization program was started. This program would result in making the subway system more accessible, add new bus and streetcar platforms, and improve the connections to regional buses and GO trains.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of Monash Valley, the right flank of the 5th Division and the 19th Division {{attacked}} Pope's. Sentries from the 1st Light Horse Regiment opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> group of Turks moving down the valley; this group, several hundred strong, started an attack on Pope's. The defenders from the 1st and 3rd Light Horse Regiments opened fire, and only three Turkish soldiers reached the Australian positions before being shot.|$|E
5|$|Around Wschodnia street, workers opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{company of}} {{soldiers}} and cavalry, and on Południowa street, a unit of gendarmes was surrounded. Several fires begun in the town, as workers set liquor stores on fire, and the government forces assaulted the first barricades, initially without much success. The tsarist representatives called from reinforcements, which came from Częstochowa, Warsaw, and summer training camps. Several infantry regiments entered the city. Eventually, Russian forces sent to suppress the workers numbered six infantry regiments and several cavalry regiments. Despite that, the situation was spiralling into a full blown uprising. On 23 June, all industries, workshops, shops and offices were closed, as the workers and government forces clashed.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Mass Effect 2 is squad-based and {{a maximum}} of two squad members may {{accompany}} the player on the battlefield. The player has direct control of Shepard while the squad members are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Battles take place in real-time, but the player can pause the action at any time to calmly target enemies and select different powers for the squad members to use. The game uses an over the shoulder perspective akin to a third-person shooter, and places strong emphasis on using cover to avoid taking damage while fighting enemy forces. The player may also issue commands to the squad members, such as sending them to take cover behind a manually picked object or focus their <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> designed target.|$|E
5|$|Cẩn's {{influence}} {{began to}} wane after his elder brother Ngô Đình Thục was appointed the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế. Thục overshadowed Cẩn and aggressively promoted Catholicism, {{which led to}} the banning of the Buddhist flag in 1963 during Vesak, the celebration of the birthday of Gautama Buddha. Cẩn's forces opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> crowd who were protesting the ban, killing nine and precipitating the Buddhist crisis. Ongoing demonstrations intensified throughout the summer as the regime responded with increased brutality, sparking the toppling of the Diem regime in a November 1963 coup. Cẩn had been offered asylum by the US Department of State, but ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. had CIA agent Lucien Conein arrest the fallen Ngô in Saigon. Cẩn was turned over to the military junta, which tried and executed him in 1964.|$|E
5|$|In {{what became}} known as the Battle of Stillman's Run, the two battalions of militia came into contact with Black Hawk and his warriors on May 14, near present-day Stillman Valley. Accounts of how the battle began are varied. Black Hawk later stated that he sent three men under a white flag to parley, but the Americans imprisoned them and opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> second group of {{observers}} who followed. Some militiamen never reported seeing a white flag; others believed that the flag was a ruse the Indians used to set an ambush. All accounts agree that Black Hawk's warriors attacked the militia camp at dusk. To Black Hawk's surprise, his forty warriors completely routed the much larger militia force. Twelve Illinois militiamen were killed in the humiliating defeat; the British Band suffered only three fatalities.|$|E

5|$|Kirchner {{moved to}} La Plata in 1969 to study {{law at the}} National University. During this period, {{the decline of the}} Argentine Revolution, the return of former {{president}} Juan Perón from exile, the election of Héctor Cámpora as president, his resignation and the election of Perón, {{and the beginning of the}} Dirty War had led to severe political turmoil. Kirchner joined the University Federation for the National Revolution (FURN), a political student group whose relationship with the Montoneros guerrillas is a matter of debate. Kirchner was not a leader of the group. He was present at the Ezeiza massacre, in which right-wing Peronist snipers opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> celebration of Juan Perón's return at the Ezeiza International Airport. He was also present at the expulsion of Montoneros from Plaza de Mayo. Although Kirchner met many members of the Montoneros, he was not a member of the group. By the time the Montoneros were outlawed by Perón, he had left FURN.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Captain Philip Broke and HMS Shannon, a 38-gun frigate, were patrolling off {{the port}} of Boston on {{blockade}} duty. Shannon had been {{under the command of}} Broke since 1806 and, under his direction, the crew held daily great gun and small arms drills lasting up to three hours each. Crew members who hit their bullseye were awarded a pound (454g) of tobacco for their good marksmanship. Broke had also fitted out his cannons with dispart and tangent sights to increase accuracy as well as degree bearings on the decks and gun carriages to allowable the crew to focus their <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> specific target. In this regard Chesapeake, with traditional gun practice and a crew that had only been together for a few months, was greatly inferior.|$|E
5|$|Saari {{initially}} opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{group of}} students taking a business studies exam, and entered {{at least one other}} classroom. According to the three students who were able to escape from the exam room (there were roughly 20 students taking the exam), Saari had approached his victims individually before shooting them. It was also said that he was revelling in the situation and was acting very aggressively. Saari encountered little resistance, and the massacre was concluded relatively quickly. He then covered the classroom in a flammable liquid, believed to be petrol, and set the room alight.|$|E

5|$|Texas {{also participated}} in the {{occupation}} of Veracruz for several months in 1914, before conducting training and upgrades {{to become the first}} ship of the US Navy to mount anti-aircraft weapons. She conducted convoy patrols early in World War I and was the first US ship to <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> German one during a convoy mission in 1917. She joined other US battleships in reinforcing the British fleet {{near the end of the}} war and was present for the German surrender. In the inter-war period she became one of the first battleships to launch and operate aircraft, and frequently alternated her time between the Atlantic and Pacific waters on training exercises.|$|E
5|$|The {{night after}} the Miami Showband massacre, gunmen opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> minibus near Gilford. It had been {{travelling}} from Banbridge to Bleary with nine people on board; all were Catholics and most had been returning from a regular bingo session. One report says it was stopped at a fake British Army checkpoint. Five Catholic civilians were shot; passenger Joseph Toland was killed outright and driver James Marks died of his wounds in January 1976. The attack was blamed on loyalists and Lost Lives—an account of every death in the conflict—states that reliable loyalist sources have confirmed the UVF was responsible. However, police have blamed the IRA. The RUC suggested the IRA had meant to attack a police minibus in revenge for the Miami killings, but had mistakenly attacked a civilian minibus instead. A report by the police's Historical Enquiries Team (HET) also suggests this. The IRA has denied responsibility.|$|E
5|$|U.S. officials, {{convinced}} that the British Band was hostile, mobilized a frontier militia and opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> delegation from the Native Americans on May 14, 1832. Black Hawk responded by successfully attacking the militia at the Battle of Stillman's Run. He led his band to a secure location {{in what is now}} southern Wisconsin and was pursued by U.S. forces. Meanwhile, other Native Americans conducted raids against forts and settlements largely unprotected with the absence of U.S. troops. Some Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi warriors with grievances against European-Americans took part in these raids, although most tribe members tried to avoid the conflict. The Menominee and Dakota tribes, already at odds with the Sauks and Meskwakis, supported the U.S.|$|E

5|$|After {{the events}} of October 2000, the IDF {{prohibited}} Israeli access to the tomb. As a result of Operation Defensive Shield, Nablus was reoccupied by the IDF in April 2002, with severe damage to the historic core of the city, where 64 heritage buildings suffered serious damage or were destroyed. Some Breslov hasidim and others began {{to take advantage of}} the new circumstances to visit the site clandestinely under the cover of darkness, evading army and police checkpoints. Eventually Joseph’s tomb was once more open to visits. In May 2002, Israeli soldiers mistakenly opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> convoy of settlers taking advantage of an ongoing incursion in Nablus to visit the tomb. Seven settlers were arrested by the army for illegally entering a combat zone. As a result of Operation Defensive Shield, the tomb was retaken by the IDF and shortly afterwards, in response to numerous requests, they renewed guarded tours of the tomb. One day every month at midnight as many as 800 visitors were allowed to pray at the gravesite. These visits were designed to prevent unauthorized and unprotected clandestine visits, mainly by Breslav Hassidim. However, in October, citing security reasons, Israel re-imposed a ban on Jewish pilgrims obtaining special permits and travelling to the tomb.|$|E
5|$|During the {{genocide}} {{and in the}} months following the RPF victory, RPF soldiers killed many people they accused of participating in or supporting {{the genocide}}. Many of these soldiers were recent Tutsi recruits from within Rwanda who had lost family or friends and sought revenge. The scale, scope, and source of ultimate responsibility of these killings is disputed. Human Rights Watch, as well as scholars such as Prunier, allege that the death toll might be as high as 100,000, and that Kagame and the RPF elite either tolerated or organised the killings. In an interview with journalist Stephen Kinzer, Kagame acknowledged that killings had occurred but stated that they were carried out by rogue soldiers and had been impossible to control. The RPF killings gained international attention with the 1995 Kibeho massacre, in which soldiers opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> camp for internally displaced persons in Butare Province. Australian soldiers serving as part of UNAMIR estimated at least 4,000 people were killed, while the Rwandan government claimed that the death toll was 338.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, Sheriff Porttens deputized {{two hundred}} men and they {{marched to the}} {{terminal}} building where they attempted to assist the strikebreakers in moving the streetcars from the street and vulnerable terminal building to the more easily protected carhouse across the street. Todd led the strikebeakers in the effort while the police provided protection. The police were able {{to hold back the}} crowd at first, using clubs to hit anyone who attempted to interfere. The rioters increased the intensity of their attack, and men on the rooftops began throwing stones and bricks. Todd was hit multiple times and {{was rushed to the hospital}} with severe injuries. The greatly outnumbered police began to abandon their posts and the strikebreakers fled into the storage buildings. People in the crowd opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> storage building and killed one of the strikebreakers and injured others. By the end of November 3, after two days of protecting the cars, less than fifty policemen remained on duty in the city. Meanwhile, the strike degenerated into a riot encompassing the entire downtown.|$|E
