40|$|SummaryPurposeMagnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) is {{the investigation of}} choice for detecting structural lesions that underlie and may accompany epilepsy. Despite advances in imaging technology, 20 – 30 % of patients with refractory focal epilepsy have normal MRI scans. We evaluated the role of repeated imaging with improved MRI technology – an increase in field strength from 1. 5 T to 3 T and superior <b>head</b> <b>coils</b> – in detecting pathology not previously seen. MethodsRetrospective review of a large cohort of patients attending a tertiary epilepsy referral centre who underwent MRI at 1. 5 T (1995 – 2004) and subsequently 3 T (2004 – 2011) with improved <b>head</b> <b>coils.</b> Scan reports were reviewed for the diagnoses and medical notes for the epilepsy classification. Results 804 patients underwent imaging on both scanners, the majority with focal epilepsy (87 %). On repeat scanning at 3 T, 37 % of scans were normal and 20 % showed incidental findings. Positive findings included hippocampal sclerosis (13 %), malformations of cortical development (8 %), other abnormalities (4 %) and previous surgery (18 %). A total of 37 (5 %) relevant new diagnoses were made on the 3 T scans not previously seen at 1. 5 T. The most common new findings were hippocampal sclerosis, focal cortical dysplasia and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour. These findings affected patient management with several patients undergoing neurosurgery. ConclusionsThe higher field strength and improved <b>head</b> <b>coils</b> were associated with a clinically relevant increased diagnostic yield from MRI. This {{highlights the importance of}} technological advances and suggests that rescanning patients with focal epilepsy and previously negative scans is clinically beneficial...|$|R

30|$|Due to {{the high}} noise {{emission}} generated by the gradients in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an efficient method of noise protection is mandatory. In addition to providing hearing protection, appropriate headphone systems also serve to facilitate communication between the operator and the patient. However, in combined PET-MR devices, use of common pneumatic headphones, as delivered by the manufacturer, is problematic due to the potential generation of attenuation artefacts in the PET measurement. Furthermore, modern multichannel <b>head</b> <b>coils</b> rarely provide space for conventional headphones. This work presents an alternative system, which aims to address these limitations while still being appropriate for both patient noise protection and communication in PET-MR.|$|R

40|$|The transmit–receive (Tx/Rx) {{birdcage}} <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> {{is often}} used for excitation instead of the body coil because of the presumably lower risk of heating in and around conductive implants. However, this common practice has not been systematically tested. To investigate whether the Tx/Rx birdcage <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> produces less heating than the body coil when scanning individuals with implants, we used a 3 T clinical scanner and made temperature measurements around a straight 15 cm conductor using either the Tx/Rx body or the <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> for excitation. Additionally, the transmitted fields of a Tx/Rx <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> were measured both in air and in gel using a resonant and a non-resonant B field probes {{as well as a}} non-resonant E field probe. Simulations using a finite-difference time domain solver were compared with the experimental findings. When the body coil was used for excitation, we observed heating around the 15 cm wire at various anatomical locations (both within and outside of the active volume of the <b>head</b> <b>coil).</b> Outside its active area, no such heating was observed while using the Tx/Rx <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> for excitation. The E and B fields of the Tx/Rx birdcage <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> extended well-beyond the physical dimensions of the coil.

While caution must always be exercised when scanning individuals with metallic implants, these findings support the use of the Tx/Rx birdcage <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> in place of the body coil at 3 T in order to reduce the risk of heating in and around conductive implants that are remote from the <b>head</b> <b>coil...</b>|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE To quantitatively and qualitatively compare MR imaging of the {{temporomandibular}} joint (TMJ) using {{a standard}} TMJ surface coil and a <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> at 3. 0 Tesla (T). MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-two asymptomatic volunteers were MR-imaged using a 2 -channel surface coil (standard TMJ coil) and a 32 -channel <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> at 3. 0 T (Philips Ingenia, Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands). Imaging protocol consisted of an oblique sagittal PDw-TSE sequence (TR/TE, 2700 / 26 ms). For quantitative assessment, a spherical phantom was imaged {{using the same}} sequence including a noise scan and a B 1 + scan. Signal-to-noise-ratio-(SNR) -maps and B 1 + maps were calculated on a voxel-wise basis. For qualitative evaluation, all volunteers underwent MR imaging of both TMJs with the jaw in closed position. Two independent blinded readers assessed accuracy of TMJ anatomical representation and overall image quality on a 5 -point-scale. Quantitative and qualitative measurements were compared between coils using t-tests and wilcoxon-rank test, respectively. RESULTS Quantitative analysis showed similar B 1 + and significantly higher SNR for the <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> compared to the TMJ surface coil. Qualitative analysis showed significantly better visibility and delineation of clinically relevant anatomical structures of the TMJ, including the articular disc, bilaminar zone and lateral pterygoid muscle. Furthermore, better overall image quality was observed for the <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> compared to the TMJ surface coil. CONCLUSION A 32 -channel <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> is preferable to a standard 2 -channel TMJ surface coil when imaging the TMJ at 3. 0 T, because it yields higher SNR, thus increasing accuracy of the anatomical representation of the TMJ...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) {{is highly}} {{sensitive}} to noise and improvement of radiofrequency coil technology represents a straightforward way for augmenting signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance in {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) scanners. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the dependence of DTI measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) on the choice of <b>head</b> <b>coil,</b> comparing two head coils with different functional designs and sensitivities. METHODS: Fourteen healthy subjects underwent DTI acquisitions at 1. 5 T. Every subject was scanned twice, using a standard quadrature birdcage <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> (coil-A) and an eight-channel array <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> (coil-B). FA and MD maps, estimated using both the linear least squares (LLS) and nonlinear least squares (NLLS) methods, were nonlinearly normalized into a standard space. Then, volumetric regions of interest encompassing typical white and gray matter structures [splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC), internal capsule (IC), cerebral peduncles (CP), middle cerebellar peduncles (MCP), globus pallidus (GP), thalamus (TH), caudate (CA), and putamen (PU) ] were analyzed. Significant differences and trends of variation in DTI measurements were assessed by the Wilcoxon test for paired samples with and without Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, respectively. RESULTS: The overall SNR of coil-B was 30 % higher than that of coil-A. When comparing DTI measurements (coil-B versus coil-A), mean FA values (SCC, IC, and TH), mean MD values (IC, CP, GP, and TH), FA standard deviation (CP, MCP, GP, and CA), and MD standard deviation (IC, CP, TH, and PU) resulted decreased (significant difference, p(cor) < 0. 05, or trend of variation, P(uncor) < 0. 05) in several gray and white matter regions of the human brain. With the exception of CP, the results in terms of revealed significant difference or trend of variation were independent of the method (LLS and NLLS) used for estimating the diffusion tensor. CONCLUSIONS: In various gray and white matter structures, the eight-channel array <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> yielded more precise and accurate measurements of DTI derived indices compared to the standard quadrature birdcage <b>head</b> <b>coil...</b>|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the high}} level of noise {{generated}} by the gradient coils in the strong magnetic field during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination, noise protection for the patient is mandatory. Furthermore, to allow the operator to remain in direct communication with the patient during the examination, it is necessary for the patient to be able to hear the operator. Noise protection and communication are typically realised with the use of non-magnetic headphones, which are driven by air instead of electric or electronic components to ensure MR compatibility. In addition to the constraint of MR compatibility, the decreasing space in newer multichannel <b>head</b> <b>coils</b> means that space-saving solutions for the headphones are required. The headphones must not be visible by the MR and must not influence the image quality of the MR measurement.|$|R

40|$|For head {{magnetic}} resonance imaging, local gradient coils {{are often used}} to achieve high solution images. To accommodate the human head and shoulder, the head gradient coils are usually designed in an asymmetric configuration, allowing the region-of-uniformity (ROU) close to the coil 2 ̆ 7 s patient end. However, the asymmetric configuration leads to technical difficulties in maintaining a high gradient performance for the insertable <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> with very limited space. In this work, we present a practical design configuration of an asymmetric insertable gradient <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> offering an improved performance. In the proposed design, at the patient end, the primary and secondary coils are connected using an additional radial surface, thus allowing the coil conductors distributed on the flange to ensure an improvement in the coil performance. At the service end, the primary and shielding coils are not connected, to permit access to shim trays, cooling system piping, cabling, and so on. The new designs are compared with conventional coil configurations and the simulation results show that, with a similar field quality in the ROU, the proposed coil pattern has improved construction characteristics (open service end, well-distributed wire pattern) and offers a better coil performance (lower inductance, higher efficiency, etc) than conventional <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> configurations...|$|E
