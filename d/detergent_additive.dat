50|$|However, the new {{regulations}} had unintended consequences. The new EPA standards required lower levels of detergent additives than were then being used by a few major fuel marketers. When the {{new regulations}} came in, most gasoline marketers who had previously provided higher levels of detergents reduced the level of detergents in their gasoline's to meet the new standard. The EPA <b>detergent</b> <b>additive</b> levels were designed to meet emissions standards but not engine longevity standards. Automakers said they were seeing persistent problems such as clogged fuel injectors, and contaminated combustion chambers, resulting in higher emissions and lower fuel economy.|$|E
50|$|Fuel {{additives}} in the United States {{are regulated}} under section 211 of the Clean Air Act (as amended in January 1995). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires the registration of all fuel additives which are commercially distributed {{for use in}} highway motor vehicles in the United States, and may require testing and ban harmful additives. The EPA also regularly reviews the health and net economic benefits of Clean Air Act policies.The act also requires deposit control additives (DCAs) be added to all gasolines. This type of additive is a <b>detergent</b> <b>additive</b> {{that acts as a}} cleansing agent in small passages in the carburetor or fuel injectors.

Furthermore, same strain exhibits both lipase and protease activity establishing this lipase as potentially desirable component of enzyme-containing detergents. Further research was carried out to investigate insusceptibility of this lipase against coexisting native protease, several commercial surfactants, oxidizing agents and commercial detergents. Lipases and proteases remained highly active when incubated with several different surfactants and oxidizing agents under washing conditions. Moreover, presence of surfactants and oxidizing agents such as Tween® 20 and Triton® X- 100 initially augment lipase and protease activity. Additionally, crude lipase preparation was insusceptible to coexisting native protease hence indicating possible storage stability. Overall, the remarkable properties of these enzymes make them potential <b>detergent</b> <b>additives...</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} be {{certified}} as Top Tier, a gasoline must pass a series of performance tests that demonstrate specified levels of: 1) deposit control on intake valves; 2) deposit control on fuel injectors; 3) deposit control on combustion chambers; 4) prevention of intake-valve sticking. Gasoline marketers agree when they sign on to Top Tier program that all their grades of gasoline meet these standards. However, premium grade gasoline may have yet higher levels of detergent additives.Typically, Top Tier gasolines will contain {{two to three times}} the amount of detergent additives currently required by the EPA. The extra additives are estimated to cost less than a cent per gallon. In addition to the <b>detergent</b> <b>additive</b> requirement, Top Tier gasoline cannot contain metallic additives, because they can be harmful to a car's emissions-control systems.|$|E

Toronto-based Texaco Canada Incorporated was sold to Imperial Oil with all Texaco Canada retail operations converted to Esso brand. Two years later, the company was awarded the National Medal of Arts. In 1991, non retail Canadian operations became Texaco Canada Petroleum Incorporated with head office in Calgary, Alberta. In 1993, several dozen tribal leaders and residents from the Ecuadoran Amazon filed a billion-dollar class-action lawsuit against Texaco, {{as a result of}} massive ecological pollution of the area and rivers around Texaco's Ecuadorian offshore drilling sites, causing toxic contamination of approximately 30,000 residents.|$|E

In 1940, Rieber {{was forced to resign}} when his connections with German Nazism, and his illegal supply of oil to the fascist forces during the Spanish Civil War were made public by the Herald Tribune through information produced by British Security Coordination. During the war, Texaco ranked 93rd among United States corporations in the value of military production contracts. In 1947, Caltex expanded to include Texaco's European marketing operations. That same year, Texaco merged its British operation with Trinidad Leaseholds under the name Regent; it gained full control of Regent in 1956, but the Regent brand remained in use until 1968-9. In 1954, the company added the <b>detergent</b> <b>additive</b> Petrox to its [...] "Sky Chief" [...] gasoline, which was also souped up with higher octane to meet the antiknock needs of new cars with high-compression engines. The next year, Texaco became the sole sponsor of The Huntley-Brinkley Report on NBC-TV. In 1959, the Texas Company changed its corporate name to Texaco, Inc. to better reflect the value of the Texaco brand name, which represented the biggest selling gasoline brand in the U.S. and only marketer selling gasoline under one brand name in all 50 states. It also acquired McColl-Frontenac Oil Company Ltd. of Canada and changes its name to Texaco Canada Limited.

It is safe, biodegradable, and reduces serious air pollutants such as soot, particulates, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and air toxics. Performance, storage require-ments, and maintenance are similar for biodiesel blend fuels and petroleum diesel. It contains no aromatics or sulfur, has a high Cetane number (good for ignition capabili-ties), and is a superior lubricant. In addition, regulated fleets can earn Energy Policy Act (EPAct) credits by purchasing biodiesel fuel.

Glycolipids are the principal storage product in GM 1 gangliosidosis whose pathogenic mechanism is not completely understood. Targeted lipidomics analysis was performed to better define disease mechanisms and identify markers of disease progression for upcoming clinical trials in humans. 36 sphingolipids and subspecies associated with ganglioside biosynthesis were tested in the cerebrospinal fluid of untreated GM 1 cats at a humane endpoint (∼ 8  months), AAV-treated GM 1 cats (∼ 5 years old), and normal adult controls. In untreated GM 1 cats, significant alterations were noted in 16  sphingolipid species, including gangliosides (GM 1 and GM 3), lactosylceramides, ceramides, sphingomyelins, monohexosylceramides, and sulfatides.

40|$|In Gasoline Direct Injection engines, direct {{exposure}} of the injector to the flame can cause combustion products to accumulate on the nozzle, which can result in increased particulate emissions. This research observes the impact of injector fouling on particulate emissions and the associated injector spray pattern and shows how both can be reversed by utilising fuel detergency. For this purpose multi-hole injectors were deliberately fouled in a four-cylinder test engine with two different base fuels. During a four hour injector fouling cycle particulate numbers (PN) increased by up to two orders of magnitude. The drift could be reversed by switching to a fuel blend that contained a <b>detergent</b> <b>additive.</b> In addition, {{it was possible to}} completely avoid any PN increase, when the detergent containing fuel was used {{from the beginning of the}} test.

Based on these results a selection of the injectors was installed in a laboratory injection chamber and the spray patterns were investigated with a high speed camera. Injectors corresponding to the largest PN drift produced the thinnest spray jets with the deepest penetration. These factors amplify the risk of wall wetting and provide an explanation for the increase of PN.

In literature it is well known the impact on cavitation of pressure and temperature of pure water, but there are only few studies analysing how the presence of certain components of <b>detergents</b> and <b>additives</b> can influence the phenomenon. The impact of <b>detergents</b> and <b>additives</b> could be explained by the modified viscosity and rheology of the solution but also by the variation in the vapour tension. Most of these effects are due to the presence of surfactants and polymers in the solution. Cavitation in dynamic pumps is an important aspect that needs to be monitored and prevented, because it can cause damages affecting pump performances and inducing an increment in the level of vibration and noise. In professional warewashing machines, as for example the models of Electrolux Rack Type, this phenomenon can affect the operating functionalities of the machine. An experimental pump test rig has been realized with the aim of studying and monitoring the influence of these parameters on cavitation inception. This test rig permits measuring the pump performances at various operating conditions, in order to obtain its characteristic curves, and also forcing cavitation to measure its Net Positive Suction Head required (NPSHr) at different flow rates.
