Some days later, Pat Swift, the <b>HR</b> <b>manager</b> for BFK and a regular user of the Consulting Association, again challenged EIS. EIS refused to dismiss their worker and lost the contract. Flash pickets were held at the Crossrail site and also at the sites of the BFK partners. The Scottish Affairs Select Committee called on the UK Business Secretary, Vince Cable, to set up a government investigation into blacklisting at Crossrail. The electrician was reinstated. Further allegations of blacklisting against Crossrail were made in Parliament in September 2017.|$|E

2500|$|This law thus {{squarely}} {{shifts the}} onus onto the employer to ensure employee safety but most mid-sized Indian service technology companies {{are yet to}} enact sexual harassment policies. Admits K Chandan, an advocate from Chandan Associates, [...] "I have a few IT clients. When I point {{to the need for}} a sexual harassment policy, most tend to overlook or ignore it. It's not high on the agenda." [...] An <b>HR</b> <b>Manager</b> of India's premier technology companies rues: [...] "I am going to use the recent case to push the policy through. Earlier the draft proposal was rejected by the company." [...] Yet another <b>HR</b> <b>manager</b> from a flagship company of India's leading business house, oblivious to the irony of her statement, admitted that the company had a grievance redressal mechanism but no sexual harassment policy in place. The lax attitudes transgress the Supreme Court judgment wherein the Court not only defined sexual harassment, but also laid down a code of conduct for workplaces to prevent and punish it, [...] "Employers or other responsible authorities in public or private sectors must comply with the following guidelines: Express prohibition of sexual harassment should be notified and circulated;private employers should include prohibition of sexual harassment in the standing orders under the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946." [...] As for the complaint procedure, not less than half of its members should be women. The complaint committee should include an NGO or other organization that is familiar with the issue of sexual harassment. When the offense amounts to misconduct under service rules, appropriate disciplinary action should be initiated. When such conduct amounts to an offense under the Indian Penal Code, the employer shall initiate action by making a complaint with the appropriate authority. However, the survey by Sakshi revealed 58 per cent of women were not aware of the Supreme Court guidelines on the subject. A random survey by AssureConsulting.com among hundred employees working in the IT industry revealed startling results: Less than 10 per cent were familiar with the law or the company's sexual harassment policy. Surprisingly, certain HR managers were also ignorant of the Supreme Court guidelines or the Draft Bill by the National Commission of Women against sexual harassment at the workplace.|$|E

This study aims at establishing the major roles played by <b>HR</b> <b>managers</b> in M&As of public sector companies in Ghana. The research examined the M&As of 10 Ghanaian companies where 10 <b>HR</b> <b>managers</b> gave detailed narratives of their roles and the part they played in the M&A processes. The qualitative method used to solicit the narratives of the <b>HR</b> <b>managers</b> resulted in the following findings: that <b>HR</b> <b>managers</b> in Ghana have a limited role in the planning process of the M&A; that indigenous <b>HR</b> <b>managers</b> perform several tasks {{in the course of}} the M&A to get employees stable before and after the M&A processes; nevertheless, they are not part of the policy formulators. The article makes a modest input of the significance of indigenous HR role in international M&As as a panacea to solving the global crises by advocating the empowerment of <b>HR</b> <b>managers</b> in developing context to be partners in the initial commencement of M&As...|$|R

2500|$|Not {{surprisingly}} {{many cases}} go unreported. However, given the complexities involved, company {{policy is the}} first step and cannot wish away the problem. Says Savita <b>HR</b> <b>Manager</b> at Icelerate Technologies, [...] "We have a sexual harassment policy that is circulated among employees. Also the company will not tolerate any case that comes to its notice. But the man at home is no different from the person at the office," [...] thus implying the social mindset that discriminates against women is responsible for the problem. Considering sexual censorship and conservative social attitudes emphasizing [...] " [...] woman's purity," [...] the victim dare not draw attention for fear of being branded a woman with [...] "loose morals". Women would rather brush away the problem or leave jobs quietly rather than speak up, even in organizations that have a zero tolerance policy. Says Chandan, [...] "I do not have exact statistics but from my experience as an advocate one in 1,500 cases are reported." [...] The problem cannot be resolved till more women speak up but the social set-up browbeats women into silence. The social stigma against the victim and the prolonged litigation process for justice thwarts most women from raising their voice. Purports K Chandan [...] "It may take between three and five years to settle a case, and in a situation where the harassment is covert, evidence is hard to gather and {{there is no guarantee that}} the ruling would be in favour of the victim. In one of the rare cases I handled a Country Manager was accused and the plaintiff opted for an out of court settlement." ...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative mono-research approach with semi-structured interviews with 7 female <b>HR</b> <b>managers</b> {{is applied to the}} explorative study in order to gain deep insight of these topics. Findings – The internal and external environments, the organisational cultures were found as having the most impact on female leadership styles in HR among women.

40|$|M. Com. (Human Resources Management) Abstract: The {{ability to}} retain top- and middle-level {{managers}} {{is seen as}} a long-term investment for an organisation. Retaining and developing talented top- and middle-level managers with organisation-specific skills and experience leads to a competitive advantage for organisations. This study explores effective retention strategies for top- and middle-level managers and identifies the challenges that <b>HR</b> <b>managers</b> face with regard to retaining top- and middle-level managers. Current literature relating to employee retention has been criticised for being too general, and providing few recommendations for overcoming the problem to retaining top- and middle-level managers. This study is important because, despite the strong need to retain top- and middle-level <b>managers,</b> <b>HR</b> <b>managers</b> face difficulties in retaining managers due to ineffective retention strategies. Losing talented managers {{is seen as a}} long-term cost for organisations. This study followed a quantitative approach. A questionnaire was developed based on an extensive literature review and a self-administered online questionnaire was distributed to <b>HR</b> <b>managers</b> registered at a professional body. A sample of 97 completed questionnaires being returned. The data were analysed using software for quantitative data, namely SPSS. The results indicated that the leadership of an organisation and performance management practices are effective retention strategies for top- and middle-level managers, as perceived by HR professionals. Challenges to retaining top- and middle-level managers include job context factors, organisational factors, and employee wellness. In addition, the results suggest that <b>HR</b> <b>managers</b> have more difficulty retaining middle-level managers than top-level managers. It is clear from this study that <b>HR</b> <b>managers</b> are interested in implementing effective retention strategies due to the rising challenges they face with regard to retaining top- and middle-level managers. This study contributes to knowledge regarding retention strategies and provides insights for <b>HR</b> <b>managers,</b> line managers and leaders of organisations in relation to effective retention strategies and retention challenges...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} views of <b>HR</b> <b>managers</b> on the {{management}} of oper-ative staff in the hotel industry in Singapore at a period of acute labour short-age. Using a case-study qualitative methodology, it examines how external and internal environmental factors affect the HRM of operative staff. In {{the view of the}} <b>HR</b> <b>managers,</b> the labour shortage has resulted in recruitment and retention problems, high labour turnover, decline in discipline at the work-place, along with other difficulties. The <b>HR</b> <b>managers</b> indicated that the exter-nal environment dictates how operative staff should be managed. The study reveals that the problems in the HRM of operative staff, {{as a result of the}} labour shortage, have been compounded by the lack of coherent and systematic HR practices and strategies in the hotels. The main argument, there-fore, is that to mitigate the effects of the external environment successfully, <b>HR</b> <b>managers</b> should pay more attention to the development of internal HRM prac-tices and strategies. It is suggested that one such strategy could be the devel-opment of an internal labour market in hotels...|$|R
