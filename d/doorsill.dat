500|$|The arch is only {{a prelude}} to the complex {{divisions}} beyond. The space inhabited by the Holy Family is holy ground. Mary, Joseph, the Christ child and the four surrounding angels occupy a space partitioned in the front by the archway and by the wall at the rear. A semicircle of figures is positioned around Christ, echoed in the semicircle of rocks placed directly inside the <b>doorsill.</b> Mary and Joseph are echoed by the colorful vertical porphyry columns on the sides, and by the statues of Adam and Eve. The rear of the shed where the four men stand, the small valley with the shepherds, the town, and the background landscape are also spatially discrete areas, which create a [...] "steady, measured movement into space {{in place of the}} more abrupt jumping from foreground to distant background common to Flemish painting."

Ainsworth writes that the [...] "message of the painting quietly emerges from the strict, perspectively correct space constructed to engage the viewer." [...] Upton agrees, explaining that the use of geometric devices emphasize the focal point, which [...] "falls well below the horizon in the exact center of the panel", a perspective that would have given the 15th center viewer, kneeling in front of the panel, a [...] "sense of physical relationship between the actual and ideal act of worship." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1927 through 1934 all Cadillac series offered Fleetwood {{bodies as}} an option. Thereafter Cadillac became more {{selective}} in offering Fleetwood bodies on its series and by 1938 {{the only way}} to obtain a Fleetwood bodied car was by buying a Cadillac Series 75 or 90, as even the Cadillac Sixty Special had a Fisher body in its inaugural year. [...] The Fleetwood script and crest would not appear on the exterior of any Cadillac until the 1947 model year when it appeared on the rear deck lid of the Sixty Special. By 1952 it also appeared on the rear deck lid of the Series 75. In 1957 the Cadillac Series 70 Eldorado Brougham joined the Sixty Special and the Series 75 as the only Cadillac models with Fleetwood bodies although Fleetwood script or crests did not appear anywhere on the exterior of the car. This marked the first time in 20 years that a Fleetwood bodied car was paired with the Brougham name. Ironically, when production of the Eldorado Brougham was shifted in 1959 from the Cadillac Fleetwood plant in Detroit to Pininfarina in Turin, Italy, only then did it acquire Fleetwood wheel discs and <b>doorsill</b> moldings, presumably because the design work and final touches were still being done by Fleetwood. Production of the Eldorado Brougham ceased in 1961 but in 1963 the Eldorado Biarritz also became Fleetwood bodied and immediately acquired Fleetwood crests on its rear quarters and Fleetwood rocker panel moldings. Interestingly the 1963 Eldorado Biarritz was also the first Fleetwood bodied convertible since the Cadillac Series 75 stopped offering 4-door and 2-door convertible body styles and production of the Cadillac Series 90 ceased in 1941.|$|E

6000|$|By {{the middle}} of April, for I made no haste in my work, but rather {{made the most of}} it, my house was framed and ready for the raising. I had already bought the shanty of James Collins, an Irishman who worked on the Fitchburg Railroad, for boards. James Collins' shanty was {{considered}} an uncommonly fine one. When I called to see it he was not at home. I walked about the outside, at first unobserved from within, the window was so deep and high. It was of small dimensions, with a peaked cottage roof, and not much else to be seen, the dirt being raised five feet all around {{as if it were a}} compost heap. The roof was the soundest part, though a good deal warped and made brittle by the sun. <b>Doorsill</b> there was none, but a perennial passage for the hens under the door board. Mrs. C. came to the door and asked me to view it from the inside. The hens were driven in by my approach. It was dark, and had a dirt floor for the most part, dank, clammy, and aguish, only here a board and there a board which would not bear removal. She lighted a lamp to show me the inside of the roof and the walls, and also that the board floor extended under the bed, warning me not to step into the cellar, a sort of dust hole two feet deep. In her own words, they were [...] "good boards overhead, good boards all around, and a good window"--of two whole squares originally, only the cat had passed out that way lately. There was a stove, a bed, and a place to sit, an infant in the house where it was born, a silk parasol, gilt-framed looking-glass, and a patent new coffee-mill nailed to an oak sapling, all told. The bargain was soon concluded, for James had in the meanwhile returned. I to pay four dollars and twenty-five cents tonight, he to vacate at five tomorrow morning, selling to nobody else meanwhile: I to take possession at six. It were well, he said, to be there early, and anticipate certain indistinct but wholly unjust claims on the score of ground rent and fuel. This he assured me was the only encumbrance. At six I passed him and his family on the road. One large bundle held their all--bed, coffee-mill, looking-glass, hens--all but the cat; she took to the woods and became a wild cat, and, as I learned afterward, trod in a trap set for woodchucks, and so became a dead cat at last.|$|E

60|$|Blythe {{shook out}} his wry clothing, and moved slowly up the Calle Grande through the hot sand. He moved without a {{destination}} in his mind. The little town was languidly stirring to its daily life. Golden-skinned babies tumbled {{over one another}} in the grass. The sea breeze brought him appetite, but nothing to satisfy it. Throughout Coralio were its morning odors--those from the heavily fragrant tropical flowers and from the bread baking in the outdoor ovens of clay and the pervading smoke of their fires. Where the smoke cleared, the crystal air, with some of the efficacy of faith, seemed to remove the mountains almost to the sea, bringing them so near that one might count the scarred glades on their wooded sides. The light-footed Caribs were swiftly gliding to their tasks at the waterside. Already along the bosky trails from the banana groves files of horses were slowly moving, concealed, except for their nodding heads and plodding legs, by the bunches of green-golden fruit heaped upon their backs. On <b>doorsills</b> sat women combing their long, black hair and calling, one to another, across the narrow thoroughfares. Peace reigned in Coralio--arid and bald peace; but still peace.|$|R
6000|$|On {{the death}} of the father there {{remained}} golden-haired Kirstie, who took service with her distant kinsfolk, the Rutherfords, and black-a-vised Gilbert, twenty years older, who farmed the Cauldstaneslap, married, and begot four sons between 1773 and 1784, and a daughter, like a postscript, in ’97, the year of Camperdown and Cape St. Vincent. It seemed it was a tradition in the family to wind up with a belated girl. In 1804, at the age of sixty, Gilbert met an end that might be called heroic. He was due home from market any time from eight at night till five in the morning, and in any condition from the quarrelsome to the speechless, for he maintained to that age the goodly customs of the Scots farmer. It was known on this occasion that he had a good bit of money to bring home; the word had gone round loosely. The laird had shown his guineas, and if anybody had but noticed it, there was an ill-looking, vagabond crew, the scum of Edinburgh, that drew out of the market long ere it was dusk and took the hill-road by Hermiston, where {{it was not to be}} believed that they had lawful business. One of the country-side, one Dickieson, they took with them to be their guide, and dear he paid for it! Of a sudden in the ford of the Broken Dykes, this vermin clan fell on the laird, six to one, and him three parts asleep, having drunk hard. But it is ill to catch an Elliott. For a while, in the night and the black water that was deep as to his saddle-girths, he wrought with his staff like a smith at his stithy, and great was the sound of oaths and blows. With that the ambuscade was burst, and he rode for home with a pistol-ball in him, three knife wounds, the loss of his front teeth, a broken rib and bridle, and a dying horse. That was a race with death that the laird rode! In the mirk night, with his broken bridle and his head swimming, he dug his spurs to the rowels in the horse’s side, and the horse, that was even worse off than himself, the poor creature! screamed out loud like a person as he went, so that the hills echoed with it, and the folks at Cauldstaneslap got to their feet about the table and looked at each other with white faces. The horse fell dead at the yard gate, the laird won the length of the house and fell there on the threshold. To the son that raised him he gave the bag of money. “Hae,” said he. All the way up the thieves had seemed to him to be at his heels, but now the hallucination left him—he saw them again in the place of the ambuscade—and the thirst of vengeance seized on his dying mind. Raising himself and pointing with an imperious finger into the black night from which he had come, he uttered the single command, “Brocken Dykes,” and fainted. He had never been loved, but he had been feared in honour. At that sight, at that word, gasped out at them from a toothless and bleeding mouth, the old Elliott spirit awoke with a shout in the four sons. “Wanting the hat,” continues my author, Kirstie, whom I but haltingly follow, for she told this tale like one inspired, “wanting guns, for there wasna twa grains o’ pouder in the house, wi’ nae mair weepons than their sticks into their hands, the fower o’ them took the road. Only Hob, and that was the eldest, hunkered at the <b>doorsill</b> where the blood had rin, fyled his hand wi’ it—and haddit it up to Heeven in the way o’ the auld Border aith. ‘Hell shall have her ain again this nicht!’ he raired, and rode forth upon his earrand.” It was three miles to Broken Dykes, down hill, and a sore road. Kirstie has seen men from Edinburgh dismounting there in plain day to lead their horses. But the four brothers rode it as if Auld Hornie were behind and Heaven in front. Come to the ford, and there was Dickieson. By all tales, he was not dead, but breathed and reared upon his elbow, and cried out to them for help. It was at a graceless face that he asked mercy. As soon as Hob saw, by the glint of the lantern, the eyes shining and the whiteness of the teeth in the man’s face, “Damn you!” says he; “ye hae your teeth, hae ye?” and rode his horse to and fro upon that human remnant. Beyond that, Dandie must dismount with the lantern to be their guide; he was the youngest son, scarce twenty at the time. “A’ nicht long they gaed in the wet heath and jennipers, and whaur they gaed they neither knew nor cared, but just followed the bluid stains and the footprints o’ their faither’s murderers. And a’ nicht Dandie had his nose to the grund like a tyke, and the ithers followed and spak’ naething, neither black nor white. There was nae noise to be heard, but just the sough of the swalled burns, and Hob, the dour yin, risping his teeth as he gaed.” With the first glint of the morning they saw they were on the drove road, and at that the four stopped and had a dram to their breakfasts, for they knew that Dand must have guided them right, and the rogues could be but little ahead, hot foot for Edinburgh by the way of the Pentland Hills. By eight o’clock they had word of them—a shepherd had seen four men “uncoly mishandled” go by in the last hour. “That’s yin a piece,” says Clem, and swung his cudgel. “Five o’ them!” says Hob. “God’s death, but the faither was a man! And him drunk!” And then there befell them what my author termed “a sair misbegowk,” for they were overtaken by a posse of mounted neighbours come to aid in the pursuit. Four sour faces looked on the reinforcement. “The Deil’s broughten you!” said Clem, and they rode thenceforward in the rear of the party with hanging heads. Before ten they had found and secured the rogues, and by three of the afternoon, as they rode up the Vennel with their prisoners, they were aware of a concourse of people bearing in their midst something that dripped. “For the boady of the saxt,” pursued Kirstie, “wi’ his head smashed like a hazelnit, had been a’ that nicht in the chairge o’ Hermiston Water, and it dunting it on the stanes, and grunding it on the shallows, and flinging the deid thing heels-ower-hurdie at the Fa’s o’ Spango; and in the first o’ the day, Tweed had got a hold o’ him and carried him off like a wind, for it was uncoly swalled, and raced wi’ him, bobbing under brae-sides, and was long playing with the creature in the drumlie lynns under the castle, and at the hinder end of all cuist him up on the starling of Crossmichael brig. Sae there they were a’thegither at last (for Dickieson had been brought in on a cart long syne), and folk could see what mainner o’man my brither had been that had held his head again sax and saved the siller, and him drunk!” Thus died of honourable injuries and in the savour of fame Gilbert Elliott of the Cauldstaneslap; but his sons had scarce less glory out of the business. Their savage haste, the skill with which Dand had found and followed the trail, the barbarity to the wounded Dickieson (which was like an open secret in the county), and the doom which it was currently supposed they had intended for the others, struck and stirred popular imagination. Some century earlier the last of the minstrels might have fashioned the last of the ballads out of that Homeric fight and chase; but the spirit was dead, or had been reincarnated already in Mr. Sheriff Scott, and the degenerate moorsmen must be content to tell the tale in prose, and to make of the “Four Black Brothers” a unit after the fashion of the “Twelve Apostles” or the “Three Musketeers.” ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{different}} Eldorado Brougham {{was sold}} for 1959 and 1960. These cars were {{not quite so}} extravagantly styled but were very unusual pieces in themselves. Priced at $13,075, they cost $1 more, each, than their older siblings. The company contracted out the assembly to Pininfarina of Italy, with whom the division has had a long-running relationship, and these Eldorados were essentially hand-built in Italy. Ironically only now did it acquire Fleetwood wheel discs and <b>doorsill</b> moldings, presumably because the design work and final touches were still being done by Fleetwood. Discreet, narrow taillights integrated into modest tailfins, and a squared-off rear roof line with rear ventiplanes caused the Italian-built Brougham to contrast sharply to the rounded roof lines, and especially the new [...] "rocketship" [...] taillights and flamboyant fins of the standard 1959 Cadillacs, which are a feature only of that year. A vertical crest medallion with Brougham script plate appeared on the front fenders and a single, thin molding ran from the front to rear along the mid-sides of the body. It did not sport Eldorado front fender letters or body sill headlights. A fin-like crest, or [...] "skeg," [...] ran from behind the front wheel opening {{to the rear of}} the car on the lower bodysides and there were special crest medallions on the trailing edge of the rear fenders. The Brougham's styling cues would prove to indicate where standard Cadillac styling would head from 1960 through the early-mid-1960s. The standard equipment list was pared down to match those of other Eldorados, plus Cruise Control, Autronic Eye, air conditioning and E-Z Eye glass. The Brougham build-quality was not nearly to the standard of the Detroit hand-built 1957-1958 models, and thus the 1959-1960 Broughams did not sell as well as their forebears. However, collector interest and values for these cars remain high. The Eldorado Brougham was moved to its own unique Series 6900 for its remaining two years.|$|E
50|$|Serga tsässon is a small, square one-storied {{pinewood}} cross-beam {{building with}} a gable roof; the dimensions of it are 565 x 438 cm. The building has one interior room (14.1 m2) and an outer shelter of 4.8 m2. The shelter is a construction supporting on six wooden posts, with a meter-high barrier made from vertical boards, the front edge has a gate about the same height. The building has walls made from round unhewn pine logs in the inside {{as well as on}} the outside, the height from the foundation up to where the wall and rafter are joined is 197 cm and up to the ridge 380 cm. The logs are tied in the corners by axe hewn backwards halving, that is typical for older log constructions in the region. The upper beams on the side walls are also quite remarkable, as the edges that extend over the wall are profiled by an axe. The building is standing on granite stones. For about 90 years, the building was off the stones and the lower logs were rotting. In 2007, it was raised on the stones again and the rotten logs were replaced by new ones. Half-beams that are axe-hewn on the top have been placed on the floor and rest on the slots in the front wall. The roof used to support on raising-plates and probably had a board-roof. By now all that is left is a raising-plate on the ridge and holes for former raising-plates in the head walls. The building has three pairs of rafters with roof boarding suitable for shingle roof fitted on it. A threefold aspen shingle-roof was installed on the tsässon during 2007 renovation. The door of the building (160 x 86 cm) is fixed on the hewn tender posts by forged hinges that are shaped like bird heads. The leaf of the door is made from boards fixed on the crosspiece and it opens on the inside. There is an old-time metal padlock, hasp and a clamp fixed on the door as well as an old-time forged handle with a ring. A millstone is used for a <b>doorsill.</b> There is a window with six panes in the eastern wall (45 x 64 cm). Signs of the place where a former cauldron hole (50 (w) x 30 (h) cm) can be seen next to the window.|$|E
50|$|Võmmorski old tsässon is a pine {{cross-beam}} building, has {{a square}} floor plan and a gable roof, the outer measurements {{of which are}} 543 x 368 cm. The {{main part of the}} building is square (368 x 373 cm). The beams of the tsässon are unhewn from the inside {{as well as from the}} outside and are tied in the corners by halving. The building is small and has one interior room (12 m2) and an outer shelter (5 m2). In front of the tsässon is an open entrance-room that is supporting on posts and at the moment does not have a barrier. Two of the lower beam rows have remained and presumably the floor of the entrance-room as well. The entrance-room is missing a third beam from above on the end gable. The height of the building from the ground up to where the rafter and the wall unite is 195 cm and the height up to the ridge is 393 cm. In the notes of the 1974 expedition, it was said that the gable roof of the building is made of shingles and the timber boarding has decayed (Kupp 1974). The walls of the building are supported in the corners and in the middle of the beam rows on granite stones. The finishing on the ceiling and on the floor is original. The building has three round log floor boards that are hewn on top and support on the stones. In turn, sawn and planed flooring that is 18-27 cm wide supports on the boards. The size of the doorway is 156 x 137 cm. According to the inventory of 1974, the dimensions of the door of the tsässon were 1.40 m x 1.65 m, which is rather questionable, as the doorway is much smaller now. The door is fixed on tender-posts, lower beam row makes for the <b>doorsill.</b> The appearance of the door is not clear from the photograph from the beginning of the 20th century, but the width allows for the assumption that it might have been a two-way door. The other photo shows a one-sided door that supports on very wide tender-posts and probably opened on the inside. The act of inventory from 1974 puts the measurements of the window as 50 x 70 cm. It is also noted that the window has been nailed up with boards, there has not been a window at all during the last couple of years, all is left are jambs (Kupp 1974). The size of the opening is 56 x 72 cm. The exterior of the building has not changed much when compared to the photos from the beginning of the 20th century. There is no boarding in the tsässon. Roof material has been changed and two crosses that were on the roof have gone missing. The barrier from the boarded entrance-room has decayed, which used to be covered from the sides up to the gable and on the front almost to the head gable, leaving only about a 20 centimetre gap. In between of the middle support posts is an entrance with a fencing gate.|$|E
40|$|The flow {{separation}} and its accompanied recirculation induced when the airflow passes over the inappropriately designed <b>doorsill</b> {{of a chemical}} fume cupboard are the key factors which would lead to deterioration of the cupboard performance. In order to alleviate the contaminant leakage of the fume cupboard induced by inherent aerodynamic deficiency, a technique using <b>doorsill</b> jet injection is developed and validated. A planar jet is ejected upward through a slot located across the inner surface of the <b>doorsill</b> of a full-scale, transparent fume cupboard and is ejected upward. The laser-light-sheet-assisted smoke flow visualization is performed to explore the physical mechanism of changing and controlling the flow structure. It is found that the up-ward injected jet is curved by the airflow drawn into the sash opening and forms a layer of clean air which can isolate the contaminant and alleviate the diffusion through the recirculating vortex on the <b>doorsill,</b> if the jet velocity is properly adjusted. The tracer gas concentration measurements present extraordinarily satisfactory results—the order of magnitude of the leak-age of tracer gas near the <b>doorsill</b> may be reduced from original levels of 102 to 1022 p. p. m. Except for the experimental fume cupboard used for development of technique, two commer-cial fume cupboards are employed for verifications and comparisons on the proposed method. Tests about the two modified commercial fume cupboards demonstrate good agreement {{to those of the}} model fume cupboard...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a review of our recent works on {{complete}} synchronization analyses of networks of the coupled dynamical systems with time-varying couplings. The main approach is composed of algebraic graph theory and dynamic system method. More precisely, the Hajnal diameter of matrix sequence {{plays a key role}} in investigating synchronization dynamics and the joint graph across time periods possessing spanning tree is a <b>doorsill</b> for time-varying topologies to reach synchronization. These techniques with proper modification count for diverse models of networks of the coupled systems, including discrete-time and continuous-time models, linear and nonlinear models, deterministic and stochastic time-variations. Alternatively, transverse stability analysis of general time-varying dynamic systems can be employed for synchronization study as a special case and proved to be equivalent to Hajnal diameter...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} the walk-by motion and sash {{movement}} on the containment leakage of an air curtain-isolated fume hood were evaluated and compared {{with the results of}} a corresponding conventional fume hood. The air curtain was generated by a narrow planar jet issued from the double-layered sash and a suction slot-flow arranged {{on the floor of the}} hood just behind the <b>doorsill.</b> The conventional fume hood used for comparison had the major dimensions identical to the air-curtain hood. SF 6 tracer-gas concentrations were released and measured following the prEN 14175 - 3 : 2003 protocol to examine the contaminant leakage levels. Experimental results showed that operating the air-curtain hood at the suction velocity above about 6 m/s and jet velocity about 1 m/s could provide drastically high containment performance when compared with the corresponding conventional fume hood operated at the face velocity of 0. 5 m/s. The total air flow required for the air-curtain hood operated at 6 m/s suction velocity and 1 m/s jet velocity was about 20 % less than that exhausted by the conventional fume hood. If the suction velocity of the air-curtain hood was increased above 8 m/s, the containment leakage during dynamic motions could be reduced to ignorable level (about 10 – 3 ppm) ...|$|E
40|$|The laser-light-sheet-assisted smoke flow {{visualization}} {{technique is}} performed on a full-size, transparent, commercial grade chemical fume cupboard to diagnose the flow characteristics and {{to verify the}} validity of several current containment test methods. The visualized flow patterns identify the recirculation areas that would inevitably exist in the conventional fume cupboards because of the fundamental configurations and structures. The large-scale vortex structures exist around the side walls, the <b>doorsill</b> of the cupboard and {{in the vicinity of}} the nearwake region of the manikin. The identified recirculation areas are taken as the ‘dangerous’ regions where the risk of turbulent dispersion of contaminants may be high. Several existing tracer gas containment test methods (BS 7258 : 1994, prEN 14175 - 3 : 2003 and ANSI/ASHRAE 110 : 1995) are conducted to verify the effectiveness of these methods in detecting the contaminant leakage. By comparing the results of the flow visualization and the tracer gas tests, it is found that the local recirculation regions are more prone to contaminant leakage because of the complex interaction between the shear layers and the smoke movement through the mechanism of turbulent dispersion. From the point of view of aerodynamics, the present study verifies that the methodology of the prEN 14175 - 3 : 2003 protocol can produce more reliable and consisten...|$|E
40|$|A {{push-pull}} {{fume cupboard}} shown is an innovative device to remove pollutants from a fume cupboard to the outdoor environment. A push flow {{coming from the}} bottom of a sash and a pull flow behind the <b>doorsill</b> are adopted to form an air curtain in the fume cupboard. Meanwhile, the roof of a push-pull fume cupboard is open to the environment and ambient fluids are drawn from the roof. To investigate the performance of a push-pull fume cupboard, a numerical model based on the finite volume method is utilized. Various ratios of push flows to pull flows are considered. Four characteristic flow fields are found at a variety of speed ratios. They are concave curtain, straight curtain, under suction and over blow modes. According to numerical results, a concave curtain mode with a fast pull flow and a weak push flow is recommended for the operation of a push-pull fume hood. Furthermore, the manikin effect on the flow filed of a push-pull fume hood is also examined in this study. A manikin is located in front of the fume cupboard according to the ANSI/ASHRAE 110 / 1995 standard. Numerical results reveal that fluid flows in a push-pull fume cupboard are not affected by a manikin. As a result, an operator {{standing in front of a}} push-pull fume cupboard is protected from pollutants inside the cupboard...|$|E
