40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the importance of}} network strength (NS) on the technological intensities (TI) of electronics firms. TI was disentangled into the categories of human resource (HR), process technology (PT) and R&D (RD) intensities, and the differences between foreign and local firms. The results show that <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> Korea and Taiwan endowed with superior NS enjoy significantly higher skill intensity, TI and RD than <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> Malaysia and Thailand, which have inferior NS. There were no obvious differences in HR practices between foreign and local <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> the four countries. Local firms enjoyed higher TI and RD than foreign <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> Taiwan. There was no statistical difference involving all the technological categories between foreign and local <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> Korea. Foreign <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> Malaysia enjoyed statistically superior TI compared with local <b>firms.</b> Local <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> Thailand showed higher TI and PT than foreign firms. TI and RD of firms are strongly correlated with NS, which showed a stronger impact on TI and RD among local rather than foreign firms. The superior NS of Korea and Taiwan has helped <b>firms</b> participate <b>in</b> higher technological activities and pay higher wages than <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> Malaysia and Thailand. ...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{survey data}} {{covering}} 8, 387 <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> 20 countries we compare credit demand and credit supply for <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> Eastern Europe {{to those for}} <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> selected Western European countries. We find that <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> Eastern Europe have a higher need for credit than <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> Western Europe, and that a higher share of firms is discouraged from applying for a loan. The higher rate of discouraged <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> Eastern Europe is driven more {{by the presence of}} foreign banks than by the macroeconomic environment or the lack of creditor protection. We find no evidence that foreign bank presence leads to stricter loan approval decisions. Finally, credit constraints do have a real cost <b>in</b> that <b>firms</b> which are denied credit or discouraged from applying are less likely to invest in R&D and introduce new products...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{catch-up}} in {{the form}} of knowledge creation of <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> emerging markets by stressing two distinct types of search behaviors of an organization – horizontal search and vertical search. Based on an empirical analysis of 204 Chinese firms, this study provides new theoretical insights into and practical implications by emphasizing that in order to catch-up, <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> emerging markets should adopt idiosyncratic search strategies different from those of <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> more advanced countries. The regression results show that due to their under-developed absorptive capacity, <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> emerging markets should avoid searching in diverse knowledge fields, as established large <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> advanced countries are encouraged to do, in order to innovate successfully. Our findings also suggest that searching for recent and emerging knowledge helps <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> emerging markets overcome their learning curve disadvantage in the process of catch-up...|$|R

40|$|The folk {{wisdom is}} that {{competition}} reduces agency costs. We provide indirect empirical support for this view. We argue that the temptation to retain cash and engage in less productive activities is more severe for <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> less competitive industries. Hence an unanticipated increase in cash-flow due to higher past returns {{is more likely to}} lead to a reduction in leverage as well as a lowering of future returns for <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> less competitive environments. Current leverage will therefore be negatively related to past returns and positively related to future returns for such <b>firms.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, for <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> more competitive industries, the negative relation between past returns and current leverage will be attenuated. Theory suggests that the relation between current leverage and future returns for such firms will be zero or negative. Using a proxy to distinguish <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> less competitive industries and data for 165 single business <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> the U. S. A., we provide empirical supports for our arguments. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Study {{collects}} panel data of listed <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> New York Stock and Shanghai Stock Exchanges during 1992 to 2008. The {{data are}} used to perform panel regression estimates for <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> each stock market. The main purpose is to compare the decision on dividend payout of listed <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> the two stock markets. The results from fixed effect estimates show that factors that can explain dividend payout of <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> New York Stock Exchange poorly explain dividend payout of <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> Shanghai Stock Exchange. This paper adds to the literature in that it provides an evidence of difference in dividend policy of firms between advanced and emerging stock markets. For policymakers in the Chinese economy, implementation of measures to enhance the advancement of bond market is necessary. Additionally, <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> Shanghai Stock Exchange should adjust their capital structure to provide room for investors to diversify and adjust their portfolios of stocks and bonds...|$|R
