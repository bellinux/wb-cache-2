5|$|Octopuses have keen eyesight. Like other cephalopods, {{they can}} {{distinguish}} the polarisation of light. Colour vision appears to vary from species to species, for example being present <b>in</b> <b>O.</b> aegina but absent <b>in</b> <b>O.</b> vulgaris. Attached {{to the brain}} are two special organs called statocysts (sac-like structures containing a mineralised mass and sensitive hairs), that allow the octopus to sense the orientation of its body. They provide information on {{the position of the}} body relative to gravity and can detect angular acceleration. An autonomic response keeps the octopus's eyes oriented so that the pupil is always horizontal. Octopuses may also use the statocyst to hear sound. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz, and hears best at 600Hz.|$|E

30|$|I-V {{plots of}} the <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 NPs and nanostructured <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 films {{are shown in}} Figure  4 d. The {{increase}} in slope for the nanostructured <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 films indicates an enhancement in the conductance of the <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3. This {{can be explained by}} the improvement in the interconnection between the nanostructures of <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 as shown in the FESEM images which thereby improves the charge mobility of the <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 structures. Moreover, the conductivity of the <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 nanostructures is also strongly related to surface-adsorbed oxygen molecules [29]. Upon exposure to air, the electrons <b>in</b> <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 nanostructures will transfer to the surface of the nanostructures and ionize the oxygen source from the air to form an oxygen surface layer. This process creates an electron depletion layer, thus reducing the conductivity of the <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 nanostructures. The large surface-to-volume ratio of the untreated <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 NPs indicates higher resistance compared to the treated nanostructured <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 films due to the significant amount of oxygen molecules bonded to the surface of the NPs which generated a broader electron depletion layer. Resistivity values calculated from the I-V curves were 4.3 × 10 − 2 and 1.3 × 10 − 2 Ω cm for the <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 NPs and nanostructured <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 films, respectively. The resistivity value of the treated <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 nanostructures is smaller than the reported value for the undoped <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 films (about 5 × 10 − 2 Ω cm) [30].|$|R

30|$|The optical {{absorption}} {{properties of the}} <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 NPs and the nanostructured <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 films were further analyzed according to their absorbance (A) spectra as shown in Figure  4 c. Two spectral regions can be recognized from the A spectra. At the visible region (λ > 350 nm), the A of the <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 NPs was {{greater than that of}} the nanostructured <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 films due to the larger surface-to-volume ratio of the NPs, which was previously discussed. Conversely, the A of the nanostructured <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 films was about one time greater than that of the <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 NPs at the UV region (λ < 350 nm), where the incident photon energy was greater than the Eopt of <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3. The photon absorption at the high-energy (>Eopt) region is attributed to the direct transition of <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 [28]. The nanostructured <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 films formed after the thermal treatment process possessed higher crystallinity and more compact structures compared to the <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 NPs. Thus, they can effectively absorb the incident photon during the photon interaction.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{interfacial}} {{charge carrier}} {{dynamics of the}} three-component semiconductor−semiconductor−metal heterojunction system were investigated and presented for the first time. The samples were prepared by selectively deposit-ing Pt nanoparticles on the TiO 2 surface of <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 -decorated TiO 2 nanobelts (<b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 −TiO 2 nanobelts (NBs)) using the typical photodeposition method. For <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 −TiO 2 NBs, because {{of the difference in}} band structures between <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 and TiO 2, the photoexcited electrons of <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 nanocrystals would preferentially transfer to TiO 2 NBs to cause charge carrier separation. With the introduction of Pt on TiO 2 surface, a fluent electron transfer from <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3, through TiO 2, and eventually to Pt was achieved, giving rise to the increasingly pronounced charge separation property for the as-prepared <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 −TiO 2 −Pt NBs. The remarkable charge separation of the samples was revealed with the corresponding photo-current measurements. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were measured to quantitatively analyze the electron transfer event between <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 and TiO 2 for <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 −TiO 2 NBs and its dependence on Pt deposition. Upon the deposition of Pt, <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 −TiO 2 NBs showed an increased apparent electron-scavenging rate constant...|$|R

30|$|The {{structural}} {{properties of}} the <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 NPs and nanostructured <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 films were further confirmed by Raman spectra. Consistent with XRD analysis, the Raman spectra also provided evidence of the bcc <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3. The observed seven Raman peaks located at 130, 248, 303, 362, 493, 594, and 626 cm− 1 are assigned to the phonon vibration modes of the bcc <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 [21]. The Raman peak of 248 cm− 1 which was only detected by the highly oriented <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 nanostructure was presumably highly dependent on {{the orientation of the}} NPs [22]. Thus, it is usually insignificant in the Raman spectrum of randomly distributed <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 NPs [23]. In addition, PL spectra of the untreated <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 NPs and treated nanostructured <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 films are presented in Additional file 1 : Figure S 3 to provide a qualitative study on the structure defect of the <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 nanostructures. A broad orange-reddish emission centered at about 610 and about 660 nm was observed in all samples. This emission is normally attributed to the defect emission due to oxygen deficiencies [24] or the intrinsic defects related to oxygen [25]. The suppression of defect-related emission of <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 is correlated to the reconstruction of defect structures and improvement in crystallinity of <b>In</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 structures [26] by thermal radiation treatment.|$|R
