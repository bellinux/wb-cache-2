25|$|Much of Chelsea (SW3) and Knightsbridge (SW1X) {{is still}} owned by Earl Cadogan, through the Cadogan Estates. Most of the {{property}} owned is in and around Cadogan Square.

Lord Cadogan is generally regarded as an effective and successful property developer/landlord being responsible, together with his management team, for bringing all of the fashion labels to Sloane Street, and also forward thinking developments on his own account at Duke of York Square on Kings Road, at Peter Jones and on Sloane Street. The Cadogan Estate has a considerable portfolio of retail property throughout Chelsea but notably on Fulham Road, Kings Road, and Sloane Street including Peter Jones, Harvey Nichols, and 12 hotels including the Cadogan Hotel.

Another endowment, £50 from Miss Hannah Raynor (died 1806) was paid from Thorndon too.|$|E
