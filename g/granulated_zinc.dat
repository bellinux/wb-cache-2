40|$|Cadmium, zinc {{and lead}} are {{constituent}} components of many semiconductor compounds. The obtained high purity distillates and ingots are large-size elements, {{which is not}} always convenient to use, and thus require additional grinding, which does not always allow maintaining {{the purity of the}} original materials. For the growth of semiconductor and scintillation single crystals it is advisable to use "friable" granular high-purity distillates, which can be processed without the risk of contamination. For example, the European low-background experiment LUCIFER required more than 20 kg of high-purity <b>granulated</b> <b>zinc,</b> which was agreed to be supplied by NSC KIPT. This task was then extended to cadmium and lead. Motivated by these tasks, the authors of this paper propose complex processes of deep refining of cadmium, zinc and lead by vacuum distillation. A device producing granules has been developed. The process of granulation of high-purity metals is explored. The purity of produced granules for cadmium and zinc is > 99, 9999, and > 99, 9995...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of using <b>zinc</b> <b>granulated</b> phosphorous biofertilizer on yield and yield components of white bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), a field experiment based on a randomized complete block design with three replications was performed. Experimental treatment were included of using phosphate and triple super phosphorous chemical fertilizer at five levels (without using of chemical fertilizer, use of % 25 phosphorous chemical fertilizer, use of % 50 phosphorous chemical fertilizer, use of % 75 phosphorous chemical fertilizer, use of % 100 phosphorous chemical fertilizer) and bio granulated phosphate fertilizer including zinc in 2 level (without using bio phosphorous fertilizer, without bio phosphorous fertilizer). Characterizations such as seed yield, the high of bush, the number of tributary branches, dry weight of bushes, whole dry weight, percentage of phosphorous and protein of seed, whole biomass and yield components were measured. Results shows {{that there is an}} significant deferent between use and not using of biological fertilizer from the view of yield components at % 5 statistical level and the most yield component with producing of 2275. 3 k on 1000 m 2 was belong to use of biological fertilizer. There is a significant deference between the various amounts of phosphate chemical fertilizer at % 1 statistical level. This shows the effect of various amounts of phosphate chemical fertilizer on yield components, that most yield components was obtained by using of % 75 of chemical fertilizer with amount of 2468 kg for 1000 m 2. in the survey of the reciprocal effects between fertilizer and bio fertilizer from the yield components view and depend on using of bio fertilizer and % 50 phosphate chemical fertilizer treatment, seed yield was 2683 kg in 1000 m 2, that comparing with other level of fertilizer and irrigation treatment become significant. Reciprocal effects of bio fertilizer treatment and the level of using fertilizer for some characterizations such as weight 1000 seed, high of bush, number of branches in the bush, number of pod in the bush, seed number harvested index at yield components and present age of pertain were significant...|$|R
