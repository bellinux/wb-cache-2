50|$|The British Army {{introduced}} the DMS (<b>Direct</b> <b>Moulded</b> Sole) ankle boot in 1958. This had a moulded plastic sole and was externally {{similar to the}} World War Two Ammo Boot. However, as the leather was of shoddy quality at best, the boots leaked {{and could not be}} made satisfactorily water-resistant. The low sideless tongue also allowed water to get in {{over the top of the}} foot. Once water had got into the boot, it would evaporate through the top of the boot but not through the plastic sole, thereby keeping the foot wet and accelerating trench-foot. Although mesh insoles were issued to combat this, they were themselves fragile and could lead to 'burning' of the sole of the foot, with the result that most soldiers used commercially available sports-shoe insoles instead. This type of boot continued in service until the mid-1980s, after its unsatisfactory characteristics became a matter of public concern owing to the severe cases of trench-foot incurred during the Falklands War. The DMS boot was worn with anklets or wind-around puttees.|$|E
40|$|The use {{of direct}} mould {{concrete}} as {{material for the}} surfacing on bridges is an increasingly used coating option. But in order to implement this option at a larger scale, {{a change in the}} formula according to “bridge code 2004 part 62. 323 ” for direct mould concrete has to be made. This is because the present formula gives too high volumes of steel fiber. Thus this report will be a part of improving the said formula. In this report the author makes an inventory in which, among others things, the amount of bridges that have been directly molded with concrete as surfacing. The inventory shows in what intervals in both runway length and the area of the surface that is <b>direct</b> <b>moulded</b> as well as where and when these bridges were built. There is also an inventory made of what kind of damage these bridges have been suffering. This is then presented in graphical format {{in order to get a}} grip on its scope. Another part of the research made in this report is to study the temperature and relative humidity’s effects on concrete shrinkage. This is done to simulate the concrete moulding in different seasons and locations in the country. The goal is to acquire an understanding on the extent of direct mould concrete usage in Sweden, as well as to find a favorable moulding-environment. If the shrinkage process is slow the grip between the main concrete construction and the surface coating is better, which in turn results into a smaller amount of required steel fibers in the concrete. It also leads to easier processing when moulding, and minimizes the surface roughness of the bridge way. Validerat; 20120311 (anonymous...|$|E

After extrusion, isomalt was transformed into an amorphous form, while paracetamol remained crystalline. Hot stage microscopy showed that HCT was amorphous in the isomalt carrier up to a concentration of 1 % (w/w). Direct compression of mixtures formulated with co-extruded isomalt/paracetamol powders yielded harder tablets compared with physical mixtures and no powder agglomeration was observed. <b>Direct</b> <b>moulding</b> of isomalt co-extruded with either paracetamol or HCT was feasible, yielding hard tablets. A fast dissolution rate was seen for both the compressed and the moulded tablets (> 80 % paracetamol and 60 % HCT released within 20 min). The compressed tablets showed a dramatic decrease in tensile strength during storage at 85 % RH, while the tensile strength of the moulded tablets remained above 0. 80 MPa after 6 months storage at the same conditions.

40|$|In micromechanics, the etching of high {{aspect ratio}} {{structures}} in polymers is a grime technology. Normally, oxygen-based {{reactive ion etching}} or the LIGA technique are used to achieve this goal. This paper reintroduces a different idea to create deep trenches at high etch speed: The ion beam etching of TeflonTM. Because of its extraordinary properties the etch selectivity with respect to most other materials is over 1000. A model is proposed to explain the high etch rate and selectivity. Generally, the etching ions are highly energetic and material from different sources is sputtered {{on top of the}} sample. The high selectivity, high anisotropy, and sputtering of material are thought to be responsible for the forming of micrograss during etching a sample.

40|$|Nanoimprinting {{promises}} low-cost {{fabrication of}} micro- and nano-devices by embossing features from a hard mould onto thermoplastic materials, typically polymers with low {{glass transition temperature}} 1. The success and proliferation of such methods critically rely on the manufacturing of robust and durable master moulds 2. Silicon-based moulds are brittle 3 and have limited longevity 4. Metal moulds are stronger than semiconductors, but patterning of metals on the nanometre scale is limited by their finite grain size. Amorphous metals (metallic glasses) exhibit superior mechanical properties and are intrinsically free from grain size limitations. Here we demonstrate direct nanopatterning of metallic glasses by hot embossing, generating feature sizes as small as 13 nm. After subsequently crystallizing the as-formed metallic glass mould, we show that another amorphous sample of the same alloy can be formed on the crystallized mould. In addition, metallic glass replicas {{can also be used}} as moulds for polymers or other metallic glasses with lower softening temperatures. Using this 'spawning' process, we can massively replicate patterned surfaces through <b>direct</b> <b>moulding</b> without using conventional lithography. We anticipate that our findings will catalyse the development of micro- and nanoscale metallic glass applications that capitalize on the outstanding mechanical properties, microstructural homogeneity and isotropy, and ease of thermoplastic forming exhibited by these materials 5, 6, 7...|$|R
40|$|Different {{cyclic loading}} modes {{have been used}} in in vitro fatigue studies of PMMA bone cement. It is unclear which loading mode is most {{appropriate}} {{from the perspective of the}} in vivo loading experienced by the cement in a cemented arthroplasty. Also, in different in vitro fatigue studies, different test specimen configurations have been used. The present work considers the influence of test specimen fabrication method (<b>direct</b> <b>moulding</b> versus moulding followed by machining) and cross-section shape (rectangular versus circular) on the tension-tension fatigue performance of two bone cement brands (SmartSet GHV and CMW 1), under force control conditions. Two trends were consistent: 1) for each of the cements, for molded specimens, a longer fatigue life was obtained with circular cross-sectioned specimens and, 2) for either rectangular or circular CMW 1 specimens, a longer fatigue life was obtained using machined specimens. A comparison of the present results to those reported in our previous work on fully-reversed tension-compression loading under force control showed that, regardless of the test specimen fabrication method or cross-section configuration used, the fatigue life was considerably shorter under tension-compression than tension-tension loading. This finding highlights the fact the presence of the compression portion in the loading cycle accelerates fatigue failure...|$|R

In this study, the influence of sample processing on the morphology and DC conduc- tivity of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) has been studied. <b>Direct</b> compression <b>moulding</b> of LDPE pellets is commonly used in research laboratories for obtaining plaque samples, whereas extrusion is an additional commonly used technique for dispersion of particles in nanocomposites prior to the compression moulding process. In this study LDPE plaques have been obtained by either compression moulding directly from pellets, or by extrusion followed by compression moulding. The morphology obtained in the first case consisted of band- ed spherulites, whereas the latter method yielded a mor- phology of small axialites. The difference in sample processing had also an impact on the DC conductivity. The DC conductivity at 22 °C and 3. 3 kV mm- 1 was of the order of 4 x 10 – 18 S m- 1 for the plaques obtained by extrusion and compression moulding whereas the plaques obtained by <b>direct</b> compression <b>moulding</b> ex- hibited a conductivity of 1 x 10 – 16 S m- 1.

40|$|There is no {{consensus}} over the optimal criterion to define the fatigue life of bone cement in vitro. Fatigue testing samples have been made into various shapes using different surface preparation techniques with little attention being paid {{to the importance of}} these variations on the fatigue results. The present study focuses on the effect of test sample shape and surface production method on the fatigue results. The samples were manufactured with two cross sectional shapes: rectangular according to ISO 527 and circular according to ASTM F 2118. Each shape was produced using two methods: <b>direct</b> <b>moulding</b> of the cement dough and machining from oversized rods. Testing was performed twice using two different bone cements: SmartSet GHV and DePuy CMW 1. At least 10 samples of each category were tested, under fully reversed tension-compression fatigue stress at ± 20 MPa, to allow for Weibull analysis to compare results. The growths of fatigue cracks were compared by means of the variations in energy absorption. It was found that fatigue crack growth can be altered by the sample shape and production method; however it is also dependent on the chemical composition of the cement. The results revealed that moulded samples, particularly those based on the ASTM F 2118 standard, can lead to up to 5. 5 times greater fatigue lives compared to the machined samples. It is thus essential, when comparing the fatigue results of bone cement, to consider the effect of production method along with the shape of the test sample...|$|R

40|$|Background: Immobilisation for {{patients}} undergoing brain or {{head and neck}} radiotherapy is achieved using perspex or thermoplastic devices that require <b>direct</b> <b>moulding</b> to patient anatomy. The mould room visit can be distressing {{for patients}} and the shells do not always fit perfectly. In addition the mould room process can be time consuming. With recent developments in three-dimensional (3 D) printing technologies comes the potential to generate a treatment shell directly from a computer model of a patient. Typically, a patient requiring radiotherapy treatment will have had a computed tomography (CT) scan and if a computer model of a shell could be obtained directly from the CT data it would reduce patient distress, reduce visits, obtain a close fitting shell and possibly enable the patient to start their radiotherapy treatment more quickly. Purpose: This paper focuses on {{the first stage of}} generating the front part of the shell and investigates the dosimetric properties of the materials to show the feasibility of 3 D printer materials for the production of a radiotherapy treatment shell. Materials and methods: Computer algorithms are used to segment the surface of the patient’s head from CT and MRI datasets. After segmentation approaches are used to construct a 3 D model suitable for printing on a 3 D printer. To ensure that 3 D printing is feasible the properties of a set of 3 D printing materials are tested. Conclusions: The majority of the possible candidate 3 D printing materials tested result in very similar attenuation of a therapeutic radiotherapy beam as the Orfit soft-drape masks currently in use in many UK radiotherapy centres. The costs involved in 3 D printing are reducing and the applications to medicine are becoming more widely adopted. In this paper we show that 3 D printing of bespoke radiotherapy masks is feasible and warrants further investigation...|$|R
