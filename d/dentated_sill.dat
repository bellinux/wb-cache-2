40|$|Experimental {{analysis}} concerning {{supercritical flow}} over a <b>dentated</b> <b>sill</b> in nonsubmerged {{conditions and the}} local scour downstream of this sill is presented. In this case, the energy dissipation is incomplete so that a scour control downstream of the hydraulic structure could be required. The use {{of this type of}} dissipation device could be needed in cases where the maximum flow depth upstream of the sill must be limited to satisfy physical or structural conditions. This could happen, for instance, in the restoration of stilling basin in gravity dams and at the outlet of diversion systems. Experimental and theoretical results, useful in the design of this type of stilling basin and scour control, are presented in the paper, with an application to the case of the Molato Dam in Italy...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} a United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) Type II stilling basin, which is {{characterized}} by blocks {{at the end of}} the chute and a <b>dentated</b> <b>sill</b> {{at the end of the}} basin. For this basin, USBR only gives overall design criteria concerning basin length and block dimensions on the basis of the assumption that the hydraulic jump remains confined within the sill. No considerations are provided concerning possible different jump types, pressure regimes, and forces acting on the sill. To comply with such a lack, an experimental campaign was undertaken that focuses on the differences among hydraulic jump types that can occur in a USBR Type II stilling basin. Jump types can range between submerged and spray jump types; accordingly, dimensionless relations are provided to predict jump type and position for assigned boundary conditions, with particular concern about the submerged/nonsubmerged distinction. Considerations about the drag force and drag coefficients are provided, along with estimates of pressure extreme fluctuations. Finally, an evaluation of the dissipation efficiency is presented for both submerged and nonsubmerged jumps, enabling comparisons among different jump types and with classical hydraulic jump. - See more at: [URL]...|$|E
