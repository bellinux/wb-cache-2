40|$|The {{diffraction}} of P, S and Rayleigh waves by 3 -D topographies in {{an elastic}} half-space is studied using a simplified indirect boundary element method (IBEM). This technique {{is based on}} the integral representation of the diffracted elastic fields in terms of single-layer boundary sources. <b>I</b> <b>t</b> <b>can</b> be <b>seen</b> as a numerical realization of Huygens’ principle because diffracted waves are constructed at the boundaries from where they are radiated by means of boundary sources. A Fredholm integral equation of the second kind for such sources is obtained from the stress-free boundary conditions. A simplified discretization scheme for the numerical and analytical integration of the exact Green’s functions, which employs circles of various sizes to cover most of the boundary surface, is used. The incidence of elastic waves on 3 -D topographical profiles is studied. We analyse the displacement amplitudes in the frequency, space and time domains. The results show that the vertical walls of a cylindrical cavity are strong diffractors producing emission of energy in all directions. In the case of a mountain and incident P, SV and SH waves the results show a great variability of the surface ground motion. These spatial variations are due to the interference between locally generated diffracted waves. A polarization analysis of the surface displacement at different locations shows that the diffracted waves are mostly surface and creeping waves...|$|R

Introduction The opening extract is from Luke Jackson, a thirteen-year-old boy who has Asperger s Syndrome which results in heightened sensitivity to particular physical activity environments. Although it is negative, and clearly there are many young people who feel differently, the extract does encourage us as teachers or coaches to critically review our awareness of the views and attitudes held by children and young people in physical education and sport. Young people s attraction to and engagement with physical education and sport is complex, varying from those who embrace being physically active whenever the opportunity arises to those who are negative about both. Moreover, youth voice in physical education and sport is compounded by young people s construction of what these activities entail, and also the current positioning of each young person in the context of their family and friends, community and popular culture (MacPhail, Collier & O Sullivan, 2009). By listening to and reporting what young people tell us about their experiences of (learning in) physical education and sport, this chapter recognizes young people as diverse and complex learners with a multiplicity of needs and interests. Listening and hearing in this way has implications for teachers and coaches, and these are considered throughout. ACCEPTEDPeer reviewe...|$|R
