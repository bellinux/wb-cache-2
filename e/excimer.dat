5|$|The {{noble gases}} {{are used in}} <b>excimer</b> lasers, {{which are based on}} {{short-lived}} electronically excited molecules known as excimers. The excimers used for lasers may be noble gas dimers such as Ar2, Kr2 or Xe2, or more commonly, the noble gas is combined with a halogen in excimers such as ArF, KrF, XeF, or XeCl. These lasers produce ultraviolet light which, due to its short wavelength (193 nm for ArF and 248nm for KrF), allows for high-precision imaging. <b>Excimer</b> lasers have many industrial, medical, and scientific applications. They are used for microlithography and microfabrication, which are essential for integrated circuit manufacture, and for laser surgery, including laser angioplasty and eye surgery.|$|E
50|$|<b>Excimers</b> and exciplexes {{are excited}} {{structures}} {{with a short}} lifetime. For example, noble gases do not form stable dimers, but do form the <b>excimers</b> Ar2*, Kr2* and Xe2* under high pressure and electrical stimulation.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Intermetallic <b>excimers</b> {{composed}} by Ia and IIb atoms have gained quite some interest {{during the last}} few years because of many open questions related to interatomic interactions, collision dynamics and different photochemical reaction paths leading to the formation of these species. Experimental data on the ground states of the LiHg, NaHg, KHg and CsHg intermetallic <b>excimers</b> determined from molecular scattering experiments {{have been reported in the}} work of Morse [1], Olson [2], Buck [3] and Buck et al. [4 [...] 7]. Molecular scattering experiments dealing with excited states of I A II B intermetallic <b>excimers</b> are rare [8]. On the other hand, comprehensive experimental examinations of the fluorescence of the I A II B intermetallic <b>excimers</b> have been performed {{during the last few}} years by both Windholz and Pichler and co-workers [9 [...] 16]. These experiments have triggered several ab initio<F...|$|R
5|$|When xenon atoms are in {{the ground}} energy state, they repel each other and will not form a bond. When xenon atoms becomes energized, however, they can form an <b>excimer</b> (excited dimer) until the {{electrons}} return to the ground state. This entity is formed because the xenon atom tends to complete the outermost electronic shell by adding an electron from a neighboring xenon atom. The typical lifetime of a xenon <b>excimer</b> is 1–5ns, and the decay releases photons with wavelengths of about 150 and 173nm. Xenon can also form excimers with other elements, such as the halogens bromine, chlorine, and fluorine.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, a {{group of}} {{researchers}} at Bell Laboratories discovered laser action in xenon, and later found that the laser gain was improved by adding helium to the lasing medium. The first <b>excimer</b> laser used a xenon dimer (Xe2) energized by a beam of electrons to produce stimulated emission at an ultraviolet wavelength of 176 nm.|$|E
5|$|The noble gases—including helium—can form stable {{molecular}} ions {{in the gas}} phase. The simplest is the helium hydride molecular ion, HeH+, {{discovered in}} 1925. Because it is composed {{of the two most}} abundant elements in the universe, hydrogen and helium, it is believed to occur naturally in the interstellar medium, although it has not been detected yet.+ molecular ion |journal=J.

These are compounds such as ArF and KrF that are stable only when in an excited electronic state; some of them find application in <b>excimer</b> lasers.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{assessing}} the site-specific emission from electronically excited helium droplets is presented. The fluorescence features of helium droplets show sharp rotationally resolved lines indicating desorption of <b>excimers</b> and emission far outside the droplets as well as blue-shifted and strongly broadened features due to emission of <b>excimers</b> confined in cavities within the droplets. A third feature is identified: slightly broadened rotational lines that we attribute to emission from <b>excimers</b> bound to the droplet surface. The line broadening arises from collisions with the helium gas within the surface layer of the helium droplets. These conditions are simulated using a high pressure gas cell in which helium gas is electronically excited using a corona discharge. Rotational line broadening of similar magnitude to that of large droplets (N ∼ 10 [superscript 7] atoms) is observed for gas pressures at about 5 bar and 80 K, corresponding to a number density of 4. 52 × 10 [superscript - 4] Å[superscript - 3]. We conclude that the <b>excimers</b> are located within a shell separated by 6 to 7 Å from the radius where the density has dropped to 50 % of its centre value. Helium droplets that are smaller (N ∼ 10 [superscript 4] atoms) exhibit rotational lines that are less broadened, which we attribute to the superposition of features originating from desorbed and from surface-bound <b>excimers.</b> A fit of the linewidths reveals that around 50 % of the <b>excimers</b> are bound {{to the surface of}} the smaller droplets.

40|$|Fluorescence {{polarization}} and {{formation of}} <b>excimers</b> were studied in N−(3 −pyrene) maleinimide−labeled sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. 1. The polarization of pyrenemaleinimide labeled vesicles {{does not change}} with temperature and shows a pronounced decrease at labeling concentrations larger than 1 mol pyrenemaleinimide per 10 mol ATPase. 2. Solubilization of the membrane with renders the polarization temperature dependent, but {{does not affect the}} concentration dependent depolarization observed in native vesicles. 3. The polarization of labeled vesicles is much smaller than to be expected from the temperature independent polarization indicating that the pyrenemaleinimide polarization did not monitor the rotation of the entire ATPase. Thus segmental motion occurs. 4. Pyrene <b>excimers</b> are observed at label concentrations larger than 1 mol label per 2. 5 mol ATPase. 5. The amount of <b>excimers</b> was critically dependent on added detergents. From the fact that non−solubilizing amounts of strongly reduced the amount of pyrene <b>excimers</b> it is concluded that in the native sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles at least two ATPase molecules must be in close contac...|$|R

25|$|Pyrene <b>Excimer</b> Formation: Pyrene monomer and <b>excimer</b> {{emission}} wavelengths are different. The {{emission wavelength}} of monomer is around 400nm {{and that of}} <b>excimer</b> is around 470nm. In this method, membrane labeled with Pyrene combines with unlabeled membrane. Pyrene self associates in membrane and then excited pyrene excites other pyrene. Before fusion, {{the majority of the}} emission is <b>excimer</b> emission. After fusion, the distance between probes increases and the ratio of <b>excimer</b> emission decreases.|$|E
25|$|Heterodimeric {{diatomic}} complexes {{involving a}} noble gas and a halide, such as xenon chloride, {{are common in}} the construction of <b>excimer</b> lasers, which are excimers' most common application. These lasers take advantage of the fact that <b>excimer</b> components have attractive interactions in the excited state and repulsive interactions in the ground state. Emission of <b>excimer</b> molecules is also used as a source of spontaneous ultraviolet light (<b>excimer</b> lamps).|$|E
25|$|Because <b>excimer</b> {{formation}} {{is dependent on}} a bimolecular interaction, it is promoted by high monomer density. Low-density conditions produce excited monomers that decay to the ground state before they interact with an unexcited monomer to form an <b>excimer.</b>|$|E

He 2 * <b>excimers</b> are produced in the surrounding bath using an external gamma-ray source. These <b>excimers</b> exist either as short-lived singlet or long-lived triplet states. We demonstrate detection of both states: in the singlet case the calorimeter records the absorption of a prompt 15 eV photon, and in the triplet case the calorimeter records a direct interaction of the molecule with the TES surface, which deposits a distinct fraction of the 15 eV, released upon decay, into the surface.

25|$|The term <b>excimer</b> (excited state dimer) is, {{strictly}} speaking, {{limited to}} {{cases in which}} a true dimer is formed; that is, both components of the dimer are the same molecule or atom.

40|$|International audienceThe {{temporal}} {{dependence of}} VUV emissions {{of the first}} continuum of xenon at around 150 nm are investigated for pressures ranging from 10 to 100 Torr and for temperatures ranging from 200 to 300 K, after briefly and selectively populating exclusively the resonant or the metastable atomic states of the 5 p 5 6 s configuration. A kinetic and spectroscopic study was performed by analyzing the VUV post luminescence decay of xenon operating with such excitation conditions.

25|$|Excimers {{are only}} formed {{when one of}} the dimer {{components}} is in the excited state.

25|$|Gas lasers, {{laser diodes}} and {{solid-state}} lasers can be manufactured to emit ultraviolet rays, and lasers are available which {{cover the entire}} UV range. The nitrogen gas laser uses electronic excitation of nitrogen molecules to emit a beam that is mostly UV. The strongest ultraviolet lines are at 337.1nm and 357.6.6nm, wavelength. Another type of high power gas laser is the <b>excimer</b> laser. They are widely used lasers emitting in ultraviolet and vacuum ultraviolet wavelength ranges. Presently, UV argon-fluoride (ArF) <b>excimer</b> lasers operating at 193nm are routinely used in integrated circuit production by photolithography.

CCSD(T) /aug-cc-pV 5 Z-PP combination finds values that are 150 cm- 1 from the experimental value for the zinc monomer and 240 cm- 1 remove from the cadmium monomer excitation experimental value. These method/basis set combinations are also used to find spectroscopic values (re, De, we, wexe, Be, and Te) that rival experimental values for dimers and <b>excimers.</b> Examples {{of this can be}} seen with the CCSD(T) /aug-cc-pV 5 Z-PP combination phosphorescent emission results.

While this combination rigorously models spectroscopic constants for monomers, dimers, and <b>excimers,</b> it does not efficiently model these constants for larger clusters with available modern computational resources. It is important to show spectroscopic trends (bonding, phosphorescent excitation and emissions) as clusters increase as the monomer and dimer emission energies do not model solid state metallophilic interactions and phosphorescence.
