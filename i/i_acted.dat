In the serial, Mark discovers his HIV medication is failing, but instead of allowing Pauline to witness his deterioration, he leaves to spend the remainder of his life travelling. Richard has classed Mark's exit as her most difficult storyline, commenting: [...] "I was so genuinely upset that Todd Carty, who played Mark, was going I could barely get my lines out for want of crying—but everybody said <b>I</b> <b>acted</b> it well. It was, I think, ten per cent acting and 90 per cent me crying my eyes out because I was being selfish and didn't want Todd to go." [...] Mark, who had appeared intermittently for 18 years, was eventually killed off-screen in 2004, dying of an AIDS-related illness.|$|E

In a later interview, he said, [...] "Obviously, <b>I</b> <b>acted</b> because I wanted the fans to like the experience. You want your performance to be liked. You don't want to suck. You don't want people to think you suck. That wasn't the goal." [...] Towards the end of the airing of the first season, he stated, [...] "I'm going to be there in every episode next season if we get a second season. So people will either continue to hate me or things will change. Things are going to change for Duncan anyway, as the season resolves. There are going to be different sides of him that you're going to get to see." [...] Before going into the filming of season two, Thomas had told Dunn that he was being written off the show, and Dunn did not react badly to the news, as by that point, it [...] "was actually a decision" [...] for him to return for the second season at all.|$|E

Silver wrote, [...] "The big mistake is a curious one for a website that focuses on statistics. Unlike virtually every other forecast we publish at FiveThirtyEight – including the primary and caucus projections I just mentioned [...] – our early estimates of Trump’s chances weren’t based on a statistical model. Instead, they were what we [...] 'subjective odds' – which is to say, educated guesses. In other words, we were basically acting like pundits, but attaching numbers to our estimates. And we succumbed {{to some of the}} same biases that pundits often suffer, such as not changing our minds quickly enough in the face of new evidence. Without a model as a fortification, we found ourselves rambling around the countryside like all the other pundit-barbarians, randomly setting fire to things".|$|E

On 19 August 1944 {{he was ordered to}} destroy the city's entire port infrastructure, stretching across seven miles, with explosives—a plan intended to prevent the use of the port to reinforce Allied forces spreading through the country in the weeks following the D-Day invasion. In 1977, Salmide spoke about the incident in an interview with Reuters. He recalled, [...] "My family were Huguenots, and <b>I</b> <b>acted</b> according to my Christian conscience, I could not accept that the port would be wantonly destroyed when the war was clearly lost." [...] On 22 August 1944, four days before the planned destruction of the port, he blew up the munitions depot where the Germans had stored 4,000 fuses to be used in destroying the port. Salmide [...] "laid strips of dynamite inside the supply bunker filled with demolition hardware and thousands of pounds of ordnance and watched as the city shook from the huge explosion." [...] Salmide's actions killed approximately 50 Germans, but were credited with saving an estimated 3,500 civilians.|$|E
2500|$|In 1955, Gable {{formed a}} {{production}} company with Jane Russell {{and her husband}} Bob Waterfield, and they produced The King and Four Queens (1956), Gable's only production. He found producing and acting to be too taxing on his health, and {{he was beginning to}} manifest a noticeable tremor, particularly in long takes. His next project was Band of Angels (1957), with relative newcomer Sidney Poitier and Yvonne De Carlo; it was not well received despite Gable's role's similarities to Rhett Butler. Newsweek said, [...] "Here is a movie so bad that it must be seen to be disbelieved." [...] Next, he paired with Doris Day in Teacher's Pet (1958), shot in black and white. The film was good enough to bring Gable more movie offers, including Run Silent, Run Deep (also 1958), with co-star and producer Burt Lancaster, which featured his first on-screen death since 1937, and which garnered good reviews. Gable started to receive television offers, but rejected them outright. At 57, Gable finally acknowledged, [...] "Now it's time <b>I</b> <b>acted</b> my age". His next two films were light comedies for Paramount: But Not for Me (1959) with Carroll Baker and It Started in Naples (1960) with Sophia Loren. The last one, despite an icy critical reception, was a good box-office success and was nominated for an Academy award and two Golden Globes. Filmed mostly on location in Italy, it was Gable's last film released in color.|$|E
2500|$|American Apparel {{has been}} subject to seven public sexual {{harassment}} lawsuits, though to date, they have all been dismissed, [...] "thrown out," [...] remanded to arbitration, or in one case, settled but with [...] "no monetary liability to the company." [...] In one prominent case, the company was sued by four ex-models for sexual harassment—including one separately named plaintiff who sued the company for $250 million—in a lawsuit which involved mutual nude photographs, sexual text messages and requests for money. The company was accused of being responsible for these leaks in a later lawsuit. However, the case was dismissed by a New York City judge in 2012. In another case, American Apparel was reprimanded in an opinion by the Second Appellate District for a settlement in which plaintiff confessed {{that she had not}} been subjected to sexual harassment and American Apparel attempted to issue press release which mentioned an arbitration hearing that had, in fact, never taken place. As of 2013, only one case, a [...] "class action [...] on behalf of all female employees" [...] which contains no [...] "specific allegations against Charney," [...] remains active. In response to the lawsuits, American Apparel has claimed that the lawsuits were extortionary attempts to [...] "shake the company down," [...] and has run advertisements saying so. Charney has maintained his innocence in all the lawsuits, telling CNBC that “allegations that <b>I</b> <b>acted</b> improperly at any time are completely a fiction." [...] The board of directors voted to strip him of his position of chairmain in June 2014 and fire him as CEO. Charney responded with legal action attempting to retain his positions.|$|E
