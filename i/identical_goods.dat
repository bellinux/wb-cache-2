2500|$|Yield {{management}} is a variable pricing strategy, based on understanding, anticipating and influencing consumer behavior {{in order to}} maximize revenue or profits from a fixed, time-limited resource (such as airline seats or hotel room reservations or advertising inventory). As a specific, inventory-focused branch of revenue management, yield management involves strategic control of inventory to sell the right product to the right customer at the right time for the right price. This process can result in price discrimination, in which customers consuming <b>identical</b> <b>goods</b> or services are charged different prices. Yield {{management is}} a large revenue generator for several major industries; Robert Crandall, former Chairman and CEO of American Airlines, gave yield management its name and has called it [...] "the single most important technical development in transportation management since we entered deregulation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dutch auction {{also known}} as an open {{descending}} price auction. In the traditional Dutch auction the auctioneer begins with a high asking price for some quantity of like items; the price is lowered until a participant is {{willing to accept the}} auctioneer's price for some quantity of the goods in the lot or until the seller's reserve price is met. If the first bidder does not purchase the entire lot, the auctioneer continues lowering the price until all of the items have been bid for or the reserve price is reached. Items are allocated based on bid order; the highest bidder selects their item(s) first followed by the second highest bidder, etc. In a modification, all of the winning participants pay only the last announced price for the items that they bid on. The Dutch auction is named for its best known example, the Dutch tulip auctions. ("Dutch auction" [...] is also sometimes used to describe online auctions where several <b>identical</b> <b>goods</b> are sold simultaneously to an equal number of high bidders.) In addition to cut flower sales in the Netherlands, Dutch auctions have also been used for perishable commodities such as fish and tobacco. The Dutch auction is not widely used, except in market orders in stock or currency exchanges, which are functionally identical.|$|E

5000|$|Gender-based price {{discrimination}} {{is a form}} of economic discrimination that occurs when one gender is charged a different price than another gender for <b>identical</b> <b>goods</b> or services. Race and class-based {{price discrimination}} also exists. Acts of discrimination often have legal ramifications, but a study of gender-based price discrimination first looks at gendered price disparities. From there, the question of whether gendered price disparities prove an intent to discriminate or constitute illegal discrimination can become a legal inquiry that is developed by examining the law of the applicable jurisdiction. [...] Gender-based price discrimination is typically disapproved of, but not universally. In the United States, a few states have adopted statutes forbidding gender-based price discrimination, but these policies are largely unenforced.|$|E

Amongst {{the rhetoric}} {{in the media}} coverage of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), it is often forgotten that it is businesses not governments that, to a large extent, engage and drive world trade.

50|$|In economics, price {{dispersion}} is variation in prices across sellers {{of the same}} item, holding fixed the item's characteristics. Price dispersion {{can be viewed as}} a measure of trading frictions (or, tautologically, as a violation of the law of one price). It is often attributed to consumer search costs or unmeasured attributes (such as the reputation) of the retailing outlets involved. There is a difference between {{price dispersion}} and price discrimination. The latter concept involves a single provider charging different prices to different customers for an <b>identical</b> <b>good.</b> Price dispersion, on the other hand, is best thought of as the outcome of many firms potentially charging different prices, where customers of one firm find it difficult to patronize (or are perhaps unaware of) other firms due to the existence of search costs.|$|R

50|$|Tesco Ireland is {{the largest}} food {{retailer}} in Ireland, with over 13,500 employees. Tesco Ireland has come in for increased criticism for apparently high prices in its Irish stores, although in its favour {{this seems to be}} because comparisons are with the British Tesco stores rather than other Irish retailers - and thus, officially speaking, like goods are not being compared with like. However, there have been general criticisms of the similar pricing between Irish supermarkets, and economic reports noting the high prices in Ireland generally. Research from Forfas, concluded that only a five per cent difference in the cost of goods between North and South was justifiable. The findings highlighted retailers' larger margins in the South vis-a-vis their operations in the North, and the Minister for Enterprise queried why the price differential in many <b>identical</b> <b>goods</b> was substantially in excess of 5%.|$|E
50|$|According {{to the law}} of {{marginal}} utility, {{the value}} of each good in a stock of <b>identical</b> <b>goods</b> is utility of the last and most easily dispensable unit. That is why price is said to be determined by supply and demand: the price reflects the (approximate and average) value of the good, but most closely reflects the value of the last use. If {{there is a shortage of}} supply, the good will cease being applied to its least important uses. All else being equal, the price will increase and the increase in price represents, so to speak, the value we attribute to the new last use. Before, with a larger supply, the last use was of less value to us. With a smaller supply the value of the last use is necessarily more important because we always satisfy our more important wants first. Therefore, the increase in price can be seen as a reflection of the increase in value we attribute to the last use of the supply.|$|E
50|$|Price {{discrimination}} {{allows a}} monopolist {{to increase its}} profit by charging higher prices for <b>identical</b> <b>goods</b> {{to those who are}} willing or able to pay more. For example, most economic textbooks cost more in the United States than in developing countries like Ethiopia. In this case, the publisher is using its government-granted copyright monopoly to price discriminate between the generally wealthier American economics students and the generally poorer Ethiopian economics students. Similarly, most patented medications cost more in the U.S. than in other countries with a (presumed) poorer customer base. Typically, a high general price is listed, and various market segments get varying discounts. This is an example of framing to make the process of charging some people higher prices more socially acceptable. Perfect price discrimination would allow the monopolist to charge each customer the exact maximum amount {{he would be willing to}} pay. This would allow the monopolist to extract all the consumer surplus of the market. While such perfect price discrimination is a theoretical construct, advances in information technology and micromarketing may bring it closer to the realm of possibility.|$|E

40|$|Pricing-to-market (PTM), the {{practice}} of differentiating {{the price of a}} good across markets, is commonly attributed to differential distribution and border costs. In this paper we show that some of this price differentiation is sustained by manufacturers selling different versions of an otherwise <b>identical</b> <b>good</b> in different markets. We study price differences across countries in the European car market, using detailed pricing, taxation, and technical information on each car model. Relative car prices show no sign of convergence during the period 2003 – 2011. PTM is pervasive: model-specific real exchange rates for mechanically identical cars differ significantly from unity. They also vary significantly across countries and, within countries, across car manufacturers. We find strong evidence that car manufacturers price discriminate by manipulating the menu of included car options and features available in each country, e. g. by including air conditioning as a standard feature as opposed to pricing it separately. We find that such bundling decisions sustain cross-country price differences of 10 % and more...|$|R
