25|$|Cold Drawing, ProcessDrawing: In this process, the {{material}} being drawn is {{at room temperature}} (i.e. Cold-Drawn). The pointed/reduced <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> or coil, which is smaller than the die opening, is passed through the die where it enters a gripping device of the drawing machine. The drawing machine pulls or draws the remaining unreduced section of the bar or coil through the die. The die reduces the {{cross section of the}} original bar or coil, shapes the profile of the product and increases the length of the original product.|$|E
25|$|The {{destruction}} date {{according to}} the Hebrew calendar was the 9th of Av, also known as Tisha B'Av. The Temple itself was located {{on the site of}} what today is the Dome of the Rock. The gates let out close to Al-Aqsa Mosque (which came much later). Although Jews continued to inhabit the destroyed city, Emperor Hadrian established a new city called Aelia Capitolina. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, many of the Jewish communities were massacred and Jews were banned from living inside Jerusalem. A pagan Roman temple was set up on the former site of Herod's Temple.|$|E

25|$|Following the Temple's {{destruction}} {{at the end}} of the First Jewish Revolt and {{the displacement}} to the Galilee of the bulk of the remaining Jewish population in Judea at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Kochva Revolt, Jewish tradition in the Talmud and poems from the period record that the descendants of each priestly watch established a separate residential seat in towns and villages of the Galilee, and maintained this residential pattern for at least several centuries in anticipation of the reconstruction of the Temple and reinstitution of the cycle of priestly courses. Specifically, this kohanic settlement region stretched from the Beit Netofa Valley, through the Nazareth region to Arbel and the vicinity of Tiberias. In subsequent years, there was a custom of publicly recalling every Sabbath in the synagogues the courses of the priests, a practice that reinforced the prestige of the priests' lineage.|$|E
500|$|Francis Bacon met George Dyer in a Soho pub. According to Bacon [...] "George {{was down}} the far <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> {{and he came}} over and said 'You all {{seem to be having}} a good time, can I buy you a drink?'" [...] (Francis Bacon quoted in: Michael Peppiat, Francis Bacon: Anatomy of an Enigma, London 2008, p. 259). From that point on, Dyer became devoted to Bacon. He admired his intellect and power and was in awe of his self-confidence. He felt as if he had found a purpose, as the {{prominent}} artist's companion. Dyer was then about thirty years old and had grown up in the East End of London in a family steeped in crime. He had spent his life drifting between theft, juvenile detention center and jail. Typical of Bacon's taste in men, Dyer was fit, masculine, and not an intellectual.|$|E
2500|$|Vibraphone {{bars are}} made from {{aluminum}} bar stock, cut into blanks of pre-determined length. [...] Holes are drilled through {{the width of the}} bars so they can be suspended by a cord. [...] To maximize the sustain of the bars, the holes are placed at approximately the nodal points of the bar, i.e., the points of minimum amplitude around which the bar vibrates. For a uniform bar, the nodal points are located 22.4% from each <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Unlike a light {{gun that}} senses {{light from a}} {{television}} screen, the Wii Remote senses light from the console's Sensor Bar (model number RVL-014), which allows consistent usage regardless of a television's type or size. The Sensor Bar is about [...] long and features ten infrared LEDs, five at each <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> The LEDs furthest from the center are pointed slightly outwards, the LEDs closest to the center are pointed slightly inwards, while the rest are pointed straight forward. The Sensor Bar's cable is [...] in length. The bar may be placed above or below the television, and should be centered. If placed above, the sensor should be {{in line with the}} front of the television, and if placed below, should be in line with the front of the surface the television is placed on. It is not necessary to point directly at the Sensor Bar, but pointing significantly away from the bar will disrupt position-sensing ability due to the limited viewing angle of the Wii Remote.|$|E

Then he brought the same <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> first {{to the point}}, and then to the eye of the unmagnetic needle, and it attracted them both; so it was evident that there was a considerable difference, in reality, between the condition of the two, though {{there was no difference in}} external appearance.|$|E

50|$|The {{torsion balance}} {{consists}} of a bar suspended from its middle by a thin fiber. The fiber acts as a very weak torsion spring. If an unknown force is applied {{at right angles to}} <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> will rotate, twisting the fiber, until it reaches an equilibrium where the twisting force or torque <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fiber balances the applied force. Then <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> force is proportional to <b>the</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar.</b> <b>The</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument comes from the weak spring constant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fiber, so a very weak force causes a large rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|R
