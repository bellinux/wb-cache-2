Thus, sucrose could enable S. mutans, S. sanguinis and many other species of bacteria to adhere strongly and resist removal, e.g. by flow of saliva (although they are easily removed by brushing). The glucans and levans (fructose polysaccharides) produced by the plaque bacteria also act as a reserve food supply for the bacteria.|$|E

40|$|The dietary {{recommendation}} to replace saturated fat with carbohydrate {{as a means}} of reducing cardiovascular risk, has been hindered by the adverse effect of <b>dietary</b> extrinsic <b>sugars</b> on plasma lipids. The project described in this thesis, formed part of a BBSRC- funded trial to examine the impact of <b>dietary</b> extrinsic <b>sugars</b> on lipoprotein kinetics. A key objective of this project was to design and deliver two diets, high and low in extrinsic sugars, to test the hypothesis of the main trial; that <b>dietary</b> <b>sugars</b> influence plasma lipids, via differential effects on the kinetics of plasma lipoproteins, in groups with moderately raised and low liver fat. This thesis presents the results from five experimental Chapters (2 - 6) : i) An independent, systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between <b>dietary</b> <b>sugars</b> and plasma lipids (Chapter 2), that confirmed significant positive and negative associations between <b>dietary</b> <b>sugars,</b> especially fructose, with plasma TAG and HDL-cholesterol, respectively; ii) the development of two experimental diets, high and low in sugars, based on the exchange of starch and sugars, using supermarket foods (Chapter 3). The exchange achieved, and came crose to achieving, target intakes for sugar, that were representative of the upper 95 th and lower 5 th percentile of sugar intake in the UK; iii) a study of the impact of these two diets on plasma lipids and lipoproteins, in groups with raised and low liver fat (Chapters 4 & 5). The high sugar diet was accompanied by significant increases in plasma TAG, apoproteins (CIII & E), and liver fat, and decreases in HOL-choiesterol, and lipoprotein particle size. In contrast, the low sugar diet was associated with opposite changes in all of these variables. The effects of both diets were shown to be more pronounced in the group with moderately raised liver fat (> 4. 2 %), and were largely unaltered by the re-analys is of sugar intake by three different methods (Chapter 6). These findings provide evidence for the practical feasibility, and experimental utility of exchanging starch and sugars in real foods.

5000|$|Literature and {{research}} on sugar addiction has been conducted {{for over a decade}} now; however most of the evidence is conducted on animals. There is a biomedical and neurological science behind the usage of mini-pigs and lab rodents. In these animal species, there are similarities with humans in terms of cognition, development of food preferences and eating disorders, digestive anatomy and functions, as well as brain development. Research has demonstrated that, under certain conditions, rats can develop addiction-like behaviors with respect to sugar. The food addiction model asserts that excessive consumption of palatable foods may be understood within the same neurobiological framework as drug addiction. The test subjects have similar brain anomalies as those described in humans. Drug addiction has an impact on the brain's reward center and substance abuse. In drug addiction, there is a [...] "drug-seeking" [...] behavior, which is similar having a [...] "sweet tooth" [...] and seeking to satisfy the desire for a sweet item. Reward from eating is controlled by the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) pathway. In the animal study, a fructose and glucose diet induced modifications in several brain regions involved in reward and eating behavior. The observations from the study asserts that food and drug consumption share a common neurobiology that [...] "hijack" [...] a neural system that primarily processes natural rewards like foods. Sugar is believed to stimulate dopamine in the central nervous system. In summary, the research provided several clinical facts and evidences on the effects of sugar consumption on the central nervous system. Human research has also been conducted on sugar (in the form of sugar-sweetened beverages) and its effects on the kidneys. Sugar consumption has been associated with the rising prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease in the United States. Since 1997, the nation has dramatically increased sugar consumption to nearly half a pound per person per day. Much of this increase is driven by high fructose syrup (HFCS) consumption, which now amounts to over 62 lb per person per year, largely in form of sugar-sweetened beverages. In addition to <b>dietary</b> <b>sugar</b> being associated with CKD risk factors, data from animal studies do suggest that sugar consumption may independently affect kidney disease risk. Studies have been conducted to highlight the severity of sugary sweetened beverage consumption. These studies were completed with a variety of test subjects to account for age, sex, diets, lifestyle choices, physical activity, smoking, level of education, and health status. The variety in the test subjects created a wide spectrum of results to match any individual. Also, the experiments consisted of a variety of consumption frequencies.

The Na(+) -dependent glucose co-transporter (SGLT 1), the liver-type facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT 2) and the intestinal-type facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT 5) are all expressed in rat jejunum [Miyamoto, Hase, Taketani, Minami, Oka, Nakabou and Hagihira (1991) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 181, 1110 - 1117]. In the present study we have investigated the effects of <b>dietary</b> <b>sugars</b> on these glucose transporter genes. A high-glucose diet stimulated glucose transport activity and increased the levels of SGLT 1 and GLUT 2 mRNAs in rat jejunum. 3 -O-Methylglucose, D-galactose, D-fructose, D-mannose and D-xylose can mimic the regulatory effect of glucose on the SGLT 1 mRNA level in rat jejunum. However, only D-galactose and D-fructose increased the levels of GLUT 2 mRNA. The GLUT 5 mRNA level was increased significantly only by D-fructose. Our {{results suggest that the}} increase in intestinal transport activity in rats caused by dietary glucose is due to an increase in the levels of SGLT 1 and GLUT 2 mRNAs, and that these increases in mRNA may be caused by an enhancement of the transcriptional rate. Furthermore, for expression of the SGLT 1 gene, the signal need not be a metabolizable or transportable substrate whereas, for expression of the GLUT 2 gene, metabolism of the substrate in the liver may be necessary for signalling.

40|$|Objective. To {{provide a}} brief {{commentary}} review of strategies to control dental caries. Dental decay {{is one of}} man’s most prevalent diseases. In many counties, severity increased in parallel with importation of sugar, reaching its zenith about 1950 s and 1960 s. Since then, severity has declined in many countries, due to the wide use of fluoride especially in toothpaste, but dental caries remains a disease of medical, social and economic importance. Within the EU in 2011, the cost of dental treatment {{was estimated to be}} € 79 billion. The pathogenesis is well understood: bacteria in dental plaque (biofilm) metabolise <b>dietary</b> <b>sugars</b> to acids which then dissolve dental enamel and dentine. Possible approaches to control caries development, therefore, involve: removal of plaque, reducing the acidogenic potential of plaque, reduction in sugar consumption, increasing the tooth’s resistance to acid attack, and coating the tooth surface to form a barrier between plaque and enamel. At the present time, only three approaches are of practical importance: sugar control, fluoride, and fissure sealing. The evidence that <b>dietary</b> <b>sugars</b> are the main cause of dental caries is extensive, and comes from six types of study. Without sugar, caries would be negligible. Fluoride acts in several ways to aid caries prevention. Ways of delivering fluoride can be classed as: ‘automatic’, ‘home care’ and ‘professional care’: {{the most important of these}} are discussed in detail in four articles in this issue of the Acta Medica Academica.

Understanding the genetic factors governing <b>dietary</b> <b>sugar</b> tolerance therefore has profound biological and medical significance. Paralogous Mondo transcription factors ChREBP and MondoA, with their common binding partner Mlx, are key sensors of intracellular glucose flux in mammals. Here we report analysis of the in vivo function of Drosophila melanogaster Mlx and its binding partner Mondo (ChREBP) in respect to tolerance to dietary sugars. Larvae lacking mlx or having reduced mondo expression show strikingly reduced survival on a diet with moderate or high levels of sucrose, glucose, and fructose. mlx null mutants display widespread changes in lipid and phospholipid profiles, signs of amino acid catabolism, as well as strongly elevated circulating glucose levels.

Regulation of this protein {{is essential for}} the provision of glucose to the body and, thus, is important for maintenance of glucose homeostasis. We have assessed expression of SGLT 1 at mRNA, protein and functional levels in the intestinal tissue of 28 d old piglets weaned onto isoenergetic diets with differing concentrations of digestible carbohydrate (CHO). We show that expression of SGLT 1 remains constant when piglets are fed up to 40 % CHO-containing diets. However, there is a significant increase in SGLT 1 expression when the CHO content of the diet is> 50 %. Morphometric analyses indicate that the increased expression is not due to a trophic effect. It has been proposed that in rat intestine, in response to a high-CHO diet, GLUT 2 (the classical basolateral membrane monosaccharide transporter) is translocated to the luminal membrane of enterocytes to absorb excess dietary glucose. We show, using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting with antibodies raised to amino acids in different epitopes of GLUT 2, that under all dietary conditions, low to high CHO, GLUT 2 is expressed on the basolateral membrane of pig enterocytes. Furthermore, functional studies indicate that there is no uptake of 2 -deoxy-d-glucopyranoside, a specific substrate of Na+-independent glucose transporters into brush-border membrane vesicles isolated from the intestines of piglets either maintained on low- or high-CHO diets.

Hence, it is timely to review current intakes of <b>dietary</b> <b>sugars</b> with respect to this guidance and as a benchmark for future surveillance. METHODS: This review collates data from nationally representative dietary surveys across the world and reports estimates of intakes of total and added sugars, and sucrose in different population subgroups. Total sugars includes all mono- and disaccharides; namely, glucose, fructose, lactose, sucrose and maltose. Added and free sugars differ in the quantity of natural sugars included in their definitions. Free sugars include sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates, whereas added sugars typically only refer to those added during processing. RESULTS: Most countries reported intakes of total sugars, with fewer reporting intakes of added sugars and sucrose. No country reported intakes of free sugars. The available data suggest that total sugars as a percentage of energy were highest in the infant (< 4 years), with mean values ranging from 20. 0 % to 38. 4 %, and decreased over the lifespan to 13. 5 – 24. 6 % in adults. Intakes of added sugars were higher in school-aged children and adolescents (up to 19 % of total energy) compared to younger children or adults. CONCLUSIONS: Further research into the dietary patterns contributing to added sugars intake in children and adolescents is warranted. It would also be beneficial to policy guidance if future dietary surveys employed a uniform way of expressing sugars that is feasible to measure and has public health significance...|$|R
