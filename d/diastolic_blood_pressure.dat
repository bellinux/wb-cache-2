25|$|During {{exercise}} the epinephrine blood concentration rises partially from increased secretion from the adrenal medulla and partly from decreased metabolism because of reduced hepatic blood flow.

25|$|While <b>diastolic</b> <b>blood</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> {{is diminished}} and the pulse pressure widens, {{systolic blood pressure}} generally remains normal or can even be slightly elevated, this is because sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis of the kidneys compensate for the decreased cardiac output. Catecholamines will increase the heart rate and increase the strength of ventricular contraction, directly increasing cardiac output. Catecholamines will also cause peripheral vasoconstriction, which causes increased systemic vascular resistance and ensures that organs are adequately perfused. Renin, a proteolytic enzyme, cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II. In the case of chronic aortic insufficiency with resultant cardiac remodeling, heart failure will develop, {{and it is possible}} to see systolic pressures diminish. Aortic insufficiency causes both volume overload (elevated preload) and pressure overload (elevated afterload) of the heart.|$|E

The relationships between <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and different anthropometric variables were determined in both age groups. The mean age of the participants was 35. 18 ± 2. 85.

25|$|The {{mechanism}} of aortic insufficiency (AI), comprises {{the pressure in}} the left ventricle falling below the pressure in the aorta, the aortic valve {{is not able to}} completely close. This causes a leaking of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle. This means that some of the blood that was already ejected from the heart is regurgitating back into the heart. The percentage of blood that regurgitates back through the aortic valve due to AI is known as the regurgitant fraction. This regurgitant flow causes a decrease in the <b>diastolic</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in the aorta, and therefore an increase in the pulse pressure. Since some of the blood that is ejected during systole regurgitates back into the left ventricle during diastole, there is decreased effective forward flow in AI.|$|E

Re-sults: the values of visceral fat thickness, preperitoneal circumference and carotid IMT were higher in patients with MS than in control subjects. Visceral fat thickness showed significant correlations with many cardiovascular risk factors (waist circumference, BMI, fasting plasma glucose, HDL and LDL cholesterol).
