40|$|The study {{demonstrates}} the key role of <b>expenditure</b> <b>policies</b> in explaining fiscal developments during EMU in the euro area, its three largest members and four "macro-imbalances" countries. It compares actual primary expenditure trends {{with those that}} would have prevailed if countries had followed neutral <b>policies</b> based on <b>expenditure</b> rules {{since the start of}} EMU. Moreover, the implications for debt trends are calculated. Results show that all sample countries except Germany applied expansionary <b>expenditure</b> <b>policies</b> already before the crisis. Consequently, expenditure and debt paths were much higher compared to a counterfactual neutral expenditure stance. Rule-based <b>expenditure</b> <b>policies</b> could have led to much safer fiscal positions much more in line with the EU's Stability and Growth Pact. An empirical analysis of the determinants of countries' expenditure stance confirms the need for stronger fiscal rules and institutions in the euro area. <b>Expenditure</b> <b>policies</b> Public debt <b>Expenditure</b> rules Sustainability Fiscal stance...|$|R

Identification of the effects of (endogenous) cyclical <b>expenditure</b> <b>policy</b> is achieved by exploiting the exogeneity of countries political and institutional characteristics, which we find to be relevant determinants of the cyclicality of expenditures. There are three main results: First, both pro- and countercyclical <b>expenditure</b> <b>policy</b> amplify output volatility, much in a way like pure fiscal shocks that are unrelated to the cycle. Second, output volatility, due to variations in cyclical and discretionary fiscal policy, is negatively associated with economic growth. Third, there is no direct effect of cyclicality on economic growth other than through output volatility. These findings advocate the introduction of fiscal rules that limit the use of (discretionary and) cyclical fiscal (<b>expenditure)</b> <b>policy</b> to improve growth performance by reducing volatility.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} government <b>expenditure</b> <b>policies</b> in the decline in aggregate output in European transition economies. It is argued that there is little evidence for the hypothesis that more expansionary <b>expenditure</b> <b>policies</b> would have helped to mitigate the output decline. While measurement problems allow for very preliminary conclusions, it appears that government expenditures were, generally, not a binding constraint for output. In those cases where {{it could be argued that}} government expenditures were a binding constraint, they were usually not the only one. Government expenditure levels still remain on the high side, at least when compared with European market-based economies, and there exists few reasons for pursuing expansionary <b>expenditure</b> <b>policies</b> to lift European transition economies out of the “transitional recession. ” While raising expenditure levels per se is an unappealing policy choice, a further reordering of expenditure priorities is desirable. In particular, increases in the share of government expenditures on capital [...] human and physical [...] are needed to improve long-run output potential. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a model of}} redistributive income taxation and public expenditure. This joint treatment permits analyzing the interdependencies between the two policies: one cannot be chosen independently of the other. Empirical evidence reveals that partisan confrontation essentially falls on expenditure policies rather than on income taxation. We examine the {{case in which the}} <b>expenditure</b> <b>policy</b> (or the size of government) is chosen by majority voting and income taxation is consistently adjusted. This adjustment consists of designing the income tax schedule that, given the <b>expenditure</b> <b>policy,</b> achieves consensus among the population. The model determines the consensus in- come tax schedule, the composition of public expenditure and the size of government. The main results are that inequality is negatively related to the size of government and to the pro-rich bias in public expenditure, and positively or negatively related to the marginal income tax, depending on substitutability between government supplied and market goods. These implications are validated using OECD data. Government policy, Income Taxation, Public Expenditure. ...|$|E

The results indicate that this reform has not had a major adverse effect on the poorest 40 percent of the population. The VAT is progressive in its incidence, and the higher revenues brought about by the VAT can provide additional funds for poverty-reducing spending, including primary education. At the same time, there is significant scope for making education spending more pro-poor by increasing the access of low-income households to schools.
