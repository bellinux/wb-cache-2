500|$|Sinclair {{released}} {{only two}} official peripherals for the ZX81, a 16KB RAM pack (actually {{the same one}} previously released for the ZX80, but rebadged) and the ZX Printer, both of which plugged into the edge connector {{at the rear of}} the ZX81. They retailed at a launch price of £49.95 each but both had notable flaws. The RAM pack was top-heavy and was supported only by the edge connector. It had a habit of falling out of its socket at crucial points and crashing the ZX81, losing anything that the user had typed in. Users turned to using sticky lumps of chewing gum, <b>double-sided</b> <b>tape</b> or Blu-Tack to cure what became known as the [...] "RAM pack wobble" [...] problem. The ZX Printer was a tiny spark printer that used two electrically charged styli to burn away the surface of aluminium-coated paper to reveal the black underlay. It worked reasonably well at first but its output deteriorated rapidly after a time.|$|E
2500|$|Mauer {{is arguably}} most noted {{for the long}} sideburns that he has worn ever since joining the big leagues. On August 10, 2006, the Minnesota Twins held [...] "Joe Mauer Sideburns Night" [...] {{in honor of the}} catcher. The first 10,000 fans were given {{synthetic}} replica sideburns with <b>double-sided</b> <b>tape</b> to share in Mauer's trademark look.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{development}} of a microfluidic gas generator using polymer film-based microfabrication method. The method is time and cost efficient and capable of fabricating microfluidic devices with feature resolution lower than 100 μm. Complicated 3 -dimentional devices can be fabricated by aligning and stacking multiple layers of patterned polymer (polystyrene, polycarbonate) films and <b>double-sided</b> <b>tapes</b> which are obtained from a digital craft-cutter. Integrated with functional features like Pt catalyst, the device can generate a variety of gas (O 2, H 2, etc) through controllable catalytic reaction...|$|R

30|$|The 3 D microstructures of the {{nanofiber}} scaffolds {{were characterized}} {{through a series}} of sectioning in both vertical and horizontal directions. Vertical sectioning was performed at four equidistant points across the y-axis (Fig.  1 a) of the scaffold using thin glass slides attached with <b>double-sided</b> <b>tapes.</b> The distance was 5  mm for the 20  mm-wide collectors and 10  mm for the 40  mm-wide collectors. Horizontal sectioning was performed at seven equidistant points (distance[*]=[*] 1.1  mm) across the z-axis. The sectioned samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Phenom ProX, NanoScience, Alexandria, VA) and analyzed using ImageJ. The images were segmented and processed for measurement of fiber diameter, fiber density, and fiber alignment.|$|R

50|$|<b>Double-sided</b> <b>tape</b> {{is created}} by {{applying}} a thin adhesive layer to each side of a carrier material. For example, double-sided tissue tape, an easy-to-rip <b>double-sided</b> <b>tape,</b> {{is created by}} applying adhesive to two sides of tissue paper, which is then wound with a siliconed paper to avoid it sticking to itself. Most adhesive tapes are manufactured in log form, such as a large 1 to 3 meter wide roll, and then an adhesive tape converter is used to slit the rolls into the required widths.|$|E
50|$|Racing Destruction Set was {{supplied}} {{on either}} floppy disk or two <b>double-sided</b> cassette <b>tapes.</b> Side 1 of the cassette had the game files and sides 2, 3, and 4 had track files. The cassette conversion {{of this game}} was done by Ariolasoft.|$|R
50|$|Solar arrays on solar {{cars are}} mounted and {{encapsulated}} very differently from stationary solar arrays. Solar arrays on solar cars are usually mounted using industrial grade <b>double-sided</b> adhesive <b>tape</b> right onto the car's body. The arrays are encapsulated using thin layers of Tedlar.|$|R
5000|$|To {{allow for}} the winding and {{unwinding}} of the tape, the backing is coated with a release agent that somewhat prevents the tape from sticking to itself or the sticking of two adhesive layers (<b>double-sided</b> <b>tapes).</b> This is accomplished by using a material that enables the easy removal of favorable interactions at the adhesive-backing or adhesive-adhesive interface, or by making both surfaces immiscible in one another. Two common materials used in polyacrylate-based adhesive tapes are fluorosilicones [...] and vinyl carbamates. Fluorosilicones are immiscible with the polyacrylates-based adhesive [...] whereas the long tails of vinyl carbamates form a high crystalline structure that the adhesive cannot penetrate. Furthermore, during peeling fluorosilicone release liners make no noise [...] whereas vinyl carbamates make loud noises.|$|R
50|$|Single-sided tapes allow bonding to {{a surface}} or joining of two {{adjacent}} or overlapping materials. <b>Double-sided</b> <b>tape</b> (adhesive on both sides) allows joining of two items back-to-back.|$|E
50|$|<b>Double-sided</b> <b>tape</b> is any {{pressure-sensitive}} tape that is coated with adhesive on both sides. It {{is designed to}} stick two surfaces together, often {{in a way which}} is not visible in the end product, due to it being in between the objects rather than overlaying them. This allows for neater-looking projects and better craftsmanship. <b>Double-sided</b> <b>tape</b> can be either thin or dimensional. Dimensional tape is thicker, and is of particular use to retail and signage uses where {{it can be used to}} allow signs or displays to stand out with a 3-D effect.|$|E
50|$|Thermal {{adhesive}} {{is a type}} of {{thermally conductive}} glue used for electronic components and heatsinks. It can be available as a paste (similar to thermal paste) or as a <b>double-sided</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|E
30|$|Analyses were {{performed}} with a JSM- 5800 {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM). They were split into two halves, and the cross-section or surface of PNG was adhered to sample holders with <b>double-sided</b> adhesive <b>tape.</b> Prior to observation, the samples were coated with gold in a sputtering device.|$|R
30|$|The {{initial and}} final dried vermicomposted samples are fixed on a {{circular}} metallic sample holder by using <b>double-sided</b> adhesive <b>tape</b> {{and then the}} samples are coated with gold using sputter coater for clear visibility of picture, followed by micrographs of surface texture at different magnifications of SEM (Bhat et al. 2015 a, b).|$|R
25|$|The dry {{specimen}} {{is usually}} {{mounted on a}} specimen stub using an adhesive such as epoxy resin or electrically conductive <b>double-sided</b> adhesive <b>tape,</b> and sputter-coated with gold or gold/palladium alloy before examination in the microscope.

50|$|In reality, of course, {{the links}} {{had to be}} glued or taped to the actor's hands. In the cast {{commentary}} for the Season 2 episode The Geometry of Shadows the actor who plays Michael Garibaldi complains that having the link glued on and then removed ripped the hair off his hand. The actress who plays Susan Ivanova replies that she used <b>double-sided</b> <b>tape</b> to stick her link to her hand instead of glue.|$|E
50|$|Re-gripping used {{to require}} toxic, {{flammable}} solvents to soften and activate the adhesive, and a vise {{to hold the}} club steady while the grip was forced on. The newest replacement kits, however, use <b>double-sided</b> <b>tape</b> with a water-activated adhesive that is slippery when first activated, allowing easier installation. Once the adhesive cures, it creates a very strong bond between grip and shaft and the grip is usually impossible to remove without cutting it off.|$|E
