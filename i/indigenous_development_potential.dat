40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} focused on {{development}} strategies of peripheral areas. In particular, the issue of integration effects on (internal) border regions {{after the completion of}} the internal European market is addressed. After a review of recent EC policies, it is claimed that there is an urgent need for the design and evaluation of active development strategies for former internal border areas. A case study on two Dutch (peripheral) border provinces is described to see how the <b>indigenous</b> <b>development</b> <b>potential</b> of such areas can be exploited as a strategic vehicle for enhancing their international competitiveness. A multiple criteria analysis is used to identify the most plausible and desirable development scenarios for these regions. 1 Regional development and border areas: a changing scene The international economic scene has manifested drastic changes in the recent past. Economic integration—or at least a breakdown of former trade barriers, instigated by political, cultural, or socioeconomic motives—is likely {{to become one of the}} most prominent stimuli for shifts in international trade flows, labour migration, and knowledge transfer. The completion of the internal market in the European Community (EC), the converging East-West developments on the European continent and the economic integration—or at least cooperation—efforts in North America [through th...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} thesis {{investigates the}} factors for <b>Indigenous</b> <b>development</b> through sport participation and achievement. The {{focus of this}} research is from a health promotion perspective, where <b>Indigenous</b> <b>development</b> is investigated as a determinant of overall health and wellbeing of Indigenous peoples. To investigate the factors of <b>Indigenous</b> <b>development</b> through sport, eight Indigenous Sports Organisations across New Zealand, Australia, Canada and The United States of America are interviewed about their perspective and implementation of the determined factors through their organizational structure and function. The literature review attempted to draw together the main factors of <b>Indigenous</b> <b>development</b> both outside and within the sport sector. Indigenous research methodologies are utilised, including the principles of Kaupapa Māori Research methods. This research has shown what the key factors are for <b>Indigenous</b> <b>development,</b> and how they are informed by the unique structure and function of Indigenous sports organisations. The main factors within the Indigenous sporting organisation structures are the health and wellbeing of their tribal communities through community development principles (including tribal), cultural values, and sporting success. The research clearly shows that sport is a valuable tool for <b>Indigenous</b> health <b>development.</b> Recommendations of the study are that more focused research is done, particularly in the area of achieving organizational objectives focusing on the advancements of their Indigenous communities...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to explore the extent to which alternative media sources challenge normative representations of Indigenous peoples and provide an opportunity for alternate representations, specifically expressions of agency and empowerment. Mainstream media oversimplifies <b>Indigenous</b> <b>development</b> goals and relies heavily upon stereotypes and problematising discourses. Critical analysis of alternative news articles show that alternative media represents issues related to <b>Indigenous</b> <b>development</b> from a collective perspective, demonstrating a strong presence of solidarity. Contestation of problematising discourses is commonly situated in a context of colonisation and ongoing marginalisation and through this narrative stories of agency and empowerment are shared. Overwhelmingly, there was evidence that <b>Indigenous</b> <b>development</b> was not being undertaken in a participatory approach, the state failing to consult and instead enforcing paternalistic and punitive policies specifically targeting Indigenous communities. A key finding of {{this research}} is that alternative media provides a voice for those silenced by state processes and policies, disseminating urgent calls for community-based engagement and recognition of the ongoing impacts of colonisation for <b>Indigenous</b> <b>development...</b>|$|R

These changes have also affected the countries’ armed forces and new approaches to procurement/acquisition come into progress. After the Cold War, countries have focused on responding to changing threats with their decreasing defense budgets. In this study, acquisition models and their effects on Turkey’s technology acquisition and defense industry are evaluated. The evaluation is performed based on criteria such as contribution to national economy, customization, acquisition cost, time and risk, life cycle cost, and technology acquisition. Major acquisition models in this study are determined as direct procurement, production under license, joint venture, <b>indigenous</b> <b>development,</b> production via international consortium. Finally, it is observed that the best model is <b>indigenous</b> <b>development</b> while the others will serve as technology acquisition for <b>indigenous</b> <b>development...</b>|$|R
