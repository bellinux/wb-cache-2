40|$|The {{metabolism}} of glyoxylate {{released as}} a result of ureide catabolism in the developing fruits of legumes was examined through an investigation of alanine-, glutamate- and serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity in these tissues. A study of the distribution of these activities among the tissues of the developing fruits of two ureide-transporting legumes, <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and an amide-transporter, snow pea (Pisum sativum), was conducted. Serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity in each species was very low relative to the alanine- and glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity. In all three species most of the aminotransferase activity was in the pods. In cowpea, alanine- and glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity was high in the embryos relative to the seed coats, whereas in <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> and snow pea the seed coats had higher activity than the embryos. Three glyoxylate aminotransferases were isolated and partially purified from extracts of <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> and snow pea developing fruits. These were a serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (SGAT), which primarily catalyzes the serine glyoxylate aminotransferase reaction; a glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase (GGAT), which catalyzes both the glutamate- and alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase reactions; and an alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGAT), which catalyzes the alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase reaction. Sucrose-density gradient ultracentrifugation indicated that the SGAT and GGAT from <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> fruits are located in the peroxisomes, and that the AGAT is located outside the peroxisomes, probably in the mitochondria or chloroplasts. These results confirm the existence of an alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGAT) as an enzyme distinct from the GGAT. The results of initial velocity kinetic studies of the enzymes isolated from <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> and snow pea, conducted at pH 7. 1, were consistent with a Ping Pong reaction mechanism involving pyridoxal phosphate as a co-enzyme. The Km values obtained for the substrates of the enzymes were in all cases higher for the amino acid than for glyoxylate. For the <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> enzymes the Km for the amino acids was about ten-fold higher than that for glyxoylate. The affinity of the snow pea enzymes for glyoxylate was less than that of the <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> enzymes. Alanine--ketoglutarate aminotransferase activity was associated with the GGAT and this activity was reversible, in contrast to the alanine- and glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity of this enzyme. The reversible aspartate--ketoglutarate aminotransferase activity of the <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> developing fruits was not catalyzed by the glyoxylate aminotransferases. The pH optimum of the GGAT and the SGAT from <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> was approximately 8. 3. The molecular weight of the GGAT and AGAT from <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> estimated by gel filtration was 104 kDa. 	The results are discussed {{in the context of the}} metabolic pathway of ureide catabolism, and its location within the fruits of different ureide transporting legumes...|$|R
