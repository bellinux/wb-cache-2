5|$|Only a {{very small}} {{fraction}} of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> in order to prevent larger diamonds from being destroyed in this process and subsequently the particles are sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of X-ray fluorescence, after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of X-rays became commonplace, the separation was done with grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than the other minerals in the ore.|$|E
5|$|Once woven, the {{material}} {{is sent to the}} BIS laboratories for testing. After quality testing, {{the material}}, if approved, is returned to the factory. It is then separated into three lots which are dyed saffron, white and green. The Ashoka Chakra is screen printed, stencilled or suitably embroidered onto each side of the white cloth. Care also <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> that the chakra is completely visible and synchronised on both sides. Three pieces of the required dimension, one of each colour, are then stitched together according to specifications and the final product is ironed and packed. The BIS then checks the colours and only then can the flag be sold.|$|E

Freeze-dried indigo is simple to use, and the crystals can be stored indefinitely {{as long as they}} are not exposed to moisture.|$|E
25|$|A {{plausible}} explanation for contacts between Villa and the German after 1915 {{is that they}} were a futile extension of increasingly desperate German diplomatic efforts and Villista dreams of victory as progress of their respective wars bogged down. Villa effectively did not have anything useful to offer in exchange for German help at that point. When assessing claims of Villa conspiring with Germans, portrayal of Villa as a German sympathizer served the propaganda needs of both Carranza and Wilson and <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> into account.|$|E
25|$|Habituation {{is shared}} across species {{and is the}} {{simplest}} form of learning. Here a person’s response to a stimulus weakens when it becomes familiar.

25|$|Members of {{the order}} Diptera have a {{holometabolous}} lifecycle, meaning they go through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa and imago, or adult. C. cadaverina typically has around 17 generations of offspring per year with 25 to 50 eggs per generation if the right conditions are present. Temperature can have an extreme impact on development. If the temperature gets above or below a certain temperature it can cause all development of the fly to stop. In general, the warmer it is, the faster the lifecycle will go; while if it is colder, the lifecycle may take longer than usual. This <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> into account when estimating the postmortem interval.|$|E
25|$|Direct skyglow {{is reduced}} by {{selecting}} lighting fixtures which {{limit the amount of}} light emitted above the horizontal (90° above the nadir). Indirect skyglow produced by reflections from illuminated surfaces is harder to manage; effective methods for limiting it include the use of low-impact lamp types (e.g. amber sources, see above), minimizing over-illumination and inefficient designs or fixtures that spread light where it is not needed. But it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> into account that, according to late 2010 publications, Italian regions using full cut off lighting only does not increase skyglow. Anyway, light reflected upwards by dark surfaces such as roads or buildings can be considered as minor, so debate about the contribution of indirect skyglow will continue.|$|E
25|$|Inventory flows can {{number in}} the {{hundreds}} depending on the system boundary. For product LCAs at either the generic (i.e., representative industry averages) or brand-specific level, that data is typically collected through survey questionnaires. At an industry level, care <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to ensure that questionnaires are completed by {{a representative sample of}} producers, leaning toward neither the best nor the worst, and fully representing any regional differences due to energy use, material sourcing or other factors. The questionnaires cover the full range of inputs and outputs, typically aiming to account for 99% of the mass of a product, 99% of the energy used in its production and any environmentally sensitive flows, even if they fall within the 1% level of inputs.|$|E
