5|$|Angel of <b>Darkness</b> <b>was</b> {{received}} poorly, prompting Eidos—fearing financial troubles {{from another}} unsuccessful game—to give development duties for future titles to Crystal Dynamics, another Eidos subsidiary. The Legacy of Kain development team {{began work on}} a new title (Tomb Raider: Legend), and Toby Gard returned {{to work as a}} consultant. The development team reassessed the brand value of the franchise and its protagonist. Chip Blundell, Eidos's vice-president of brand management, commented that the designers understood that fans saw the character and brand as their own, rather than Eidos's. With that in mind, the team retooled the franchise and character to emphasise aspects of the original game that made them unique. The storyline intended for a trilogy of games that started with Angel of <b>Darkness</b> <b>was</b> abandoned and a new plot was created for Legend.|$|E
5|$|Edge of <b>Darkness</b> <b>was</b> placed fifteenth (fourth {{position}} {{out of the}} dramas {{featured on}} the list) on the British Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes in 2000, the BFI describing it as “a gripping, innovative six-part drama which fully deserves its cult status and many awards.”. Radio Times television editor Alison Graham, in 2003, listed {{it as one of}} the forty greatest television programmes ever made. It was one of only seven dramas listed in Broadcast magazine's list of the fifty most influential television programmes, published in July 2004. In March 2007, Edge of <b>Darkness</b> <b>was</b> placed third in Channel 4's list of the Greatest TV Dramas. Also on Channel 4, Darius Jedburgh was listed eighty-fourth in their list of the One Hundred Greatest TV Characters in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Edge of <b>Darkness</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on VHS videotape by the BBC in 1987. There {{was also a}} release from CBS/Fox Video in North America at the same time. The soundtrack was also released as an album entitled Edge of Darkness.|$|E

40|$|In the article, phraseological {{units with}} {{component}} symbol <b>darkness</b> <b>are</b> investigated in ethnolinguistic aspect. The data investigated shows the remoteness, universality and cogency of this symbol for human consciousness. Four thematic groups of PU with the component <b>darkness</b> have <b>been</b> selected and analysed, representing mythological and religious conception darkness as source of life, death, embodiment of sinfulness, ignorance, misunderstanding. It is found out, that symbol darkness {{as a component}} of PU makes up culturally meaningful unit, interpreting such spheres of vital activity of man, as: ontological (<b>darkness</b> <b>is</b> related to death); gnosiological (darkness as vagueness, uncertainty); religious (<b>darkness</b> <b>is</b> Divine punishment, personifies dark, devil forces, sin, disbelief) ...|$|R

5|$|First {{broadcast}} on BBC2, Edge of <b>Darkness</b> <b>was</b> met with such widespread critical acclaim that within days it {{had earned a}} repeat on BBC1. Winner of several prestigious awards, it remains highly regarded to this day, often cited {{as one of the}} best and most influential pieces of British television drama ever made. The series' director, Martin Campbell, filmed a remake, released in January 2010, starring Mel Gibson and set in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The launch, which {{occurred}} in pre-dawn <b>darkness,</b> <b>was</b> the first American night launch since Apollo 17, and was watched by several thousand spectators. The unusual launching time {{was due to}} tracking requirements for the primary payload, INSAT-1B; the program would not have another night launch until STS-61-B in 1985. The crew had attempted to prepare for it by training in darkened simulators so as to keep their night vision, but in practice {{it was discovered that}} the light of the solid-fuel rocket boosters made the immediate area around the launchpad virtually as bright as a day launch.|$|E
5|$|A polar bear—the {{guardian}} of the ice wand—raises the ice wand from beneath the ocean. The fairies add an ice wand to each planet of the Solar System. Along with the white wand at Fairy World, the ice wands create a celestial smile that projects its light into The Darkness. The smile transforms it into a bright sun, The Kindness, and Timmy concludes The <b>Darkness</b> <b>was</b> only looking for a friend. The group returns to Dimmsdale, where an Eliminator, dubbed a 'Hug'inator by Cosmo, crashes {{in front of them}} and spews out everyone who had been sucked in. Everyone parties in Fairy World and celebrates the chosen one's accomplishment.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of Escape from Butcher Bay, Starbreeze again {{encountered}} financial difficulties after having not received a significant royalty payment from Vivendi. It sold part of its motion capture and animation department to a British company, Centroid. However, the game helped set Starbreeze's reputation as a studio capable of making good licensed titles. With the help of Union Entertainment, an intermediary company, Starbreeze {{signed an agreement with}} Majesco Entertainment for a new title set within The Darkness universe owned by Top Cow Comics on July 16, 2004. Midway through the game's development, Majesco underwent restructuring because of financial difficulties, shifted its focus, and dropped the game. 2K Games stepped up and acquired the publishing rights. 2K extended the game's development cycle, and asked Starbreeze to develop a multiplayer mode for the game. The <b>Darkness</b> <b>was</b> released in 2007. It fared worse than the team expected critically, but its commercial performance was satisfactory, selling more than 1 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{critical}} buzz surrounding the show, BBC1 Controller, Michael Grade, quickly announced that the series would be repeated on BBC1, stating, “I think it will reach a wider audience and it deserves it”, and so Edge of <b>Darkness</b> <b>was</b> duly shown, in double episodes, over three consecutive nights between 19 December and 21 December 1985, the fastest time between original broadcast and repeat in the BBC's history. These repeats were accompanied by a disclaimer that the GAIA organisation depicted in the programme was not connected with the Gaia publishing company supported by Prince Philip. It was a move that paid off – Edge of Darkness doubled its audience on BBC1 to 8 million viewers.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{relaunch}} of Star Trek in 2009 {{with a new}} cast playing those roles seen in The Original Series, {{there was}} commentary online {{about the lack of}} female characters and whether Rand might be appearing in future installments. While the sequel, Star Trek Into <b>Darkness,</b> <b>was</b> in production, Rand was one of five characters who was stated not to be appearing in the film by writer Roberto Orci. But there was still speculation {{at the time of the}} broadcast of the first trailer about who Alice Eve was portraying in the film. The options given by Tor.com was that it was either Janice Rand or Carol Marcus. Daily Variety reported that she was cast as someone new to the franchise, but she was actually cast as Marcus.|$|E

5|$|Star Trek Into Darkness is a 2013 American {{science fiction}} film {{produced}} by Bad Robot Productions and Skydance Productions, and distributed by Paramount Pictures. It {{was written by}} Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof, and was produced by J. J. Abrams and Bryan Burk {{in addition to the}} three writers. Abrams also directed the film. It is the twelfth film in the Star Trek film franchise, and a sequel to 2009's Star Trek which rebooted the series with a new cast. The film follows Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and the crew of the USS Enterprise as they seek to prevent Admiral Alexander Marcus (Peter Weller) from starting a war with the Klingon Empire, and Khan Noonien Singh (Benedict Cumberbatch) from getting his revenge on Starfleet. Star Trek Into <b>Darkness</b> <b>was</b> made on a production budget of $190 million.|$|E
5|$|The film earned {{considerable}} {{critical and}} financial success, grossing in inflation-adjusted dollars more box office sales {{than any previous}} Star Trek film. The plaudits include the franchise's first Academy Award (for makeup). The film's major cast members are contracted for two sequels. Paramount's sequel to the 2009 film, Star Trek Into Darkness, premiered in Sydney, Australia, on April 23, 2013, but the film did not release in the United States until May 17, 2013. While the film was not as successful in the North American box office as its predecessor, internationally, in terms of box office receipts, Into <b>Darkness</b> <b>was</b> the most successful of the franchise. A thirteenth film entitled Star Trek Beyond was released on July 22, 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Tomb Raider: Angel of <b>Darkness</b> <b>was</b> {{composed}} by Peter Connelly and Martin Iveson. The soundtrack, compared to earlier {{entries in the}} franchise, was far more orchestral. It {{was also one of}} the few areas of the game's development that did not suffer setbacks or similar problems. The score was recorded live by the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, London, in 2002. It was orchestrated by Peter Wraight and conducted by David Snell. The Europe-exclusive 'Collector's Edition' of the game included eight tracks from the game's soundtrack on the bonus documentary DVD. These tracks were later release as a stand-alone Audio CD.|$|E

5|$|Charig et al. {{pointed to}} the {{presence}} of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original. Spetner et al. then attempted to show that the cracks would have propagated naturally through their postulated cement layer, but neglected to account {{for the fact that the}} cracks were old and had been filled with calcite, and thus were not able to propagate. They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through X-ray spectroscopy, and did find something that was not rock; it was not cement either, and is most probably a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when moulds were made of the specimen. Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig et al. reported a discolouration: a dark band between two layers of limestone – they say it is the product of sedimentation. It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree, so the <b>darkness</b> <b>was</b> attributed to such impurities. They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.|$|E
5|$|As an {{insufficient}} number of transport aircraft were {{allocated to the}} brigade, it was only possible to transport 3rd Parachute Battalion by air, with the battalion's strength consisting of its headquarters staff and 'B' and 'C' companies. The battalion landed at Gibraltar at dawn on 10 November, and its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Pine Coffin, was informed that the battalion was scheduled to conduct an airborne operation the next day. Pine Coffin was briefed by Lt. Gen. Kenneth Anderson, commander of the British First Army, on the mission; it was to take off from the airfield at Maison Blanche and conduct a parachute drop to capture an airfield near the port of Bône, which bordered both Tunisia and Algeria. It was known by Allied intelligence that a battalion of German Fallschirmjaeger were currently stationed at Tunis, {{and that they were}} likely to be given the same task; as such, it was vital that the two companies capture the airfield first. Once this had been achieved, it would then hold the airfield until relieved by No. 6 Commando, which would conduct an amphibious landing, capture Bône itself and link up with the battalion. This was a challenging task for Pine Coffin, as the battalion had arrived in fewer Dakotas than it would need to conduct a parachute drop, and two aircraft had failed to arrive at Gibraltar; however, sufficient aircraft were found and at 04:30 on 11 November they took off from Gibraltar, landing at Maison Blanche at 09:00. However, since the American pilots flying the Dakotas had no experience with night drops, and locating drop zones in <b>darkness</b> <b>was</b> extremely difficult, it was decided to delay the mission until dawn on 12 November.|$|E
