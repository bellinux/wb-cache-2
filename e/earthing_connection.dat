50|$|In {{contrast}} to a SELV circuit, a PELV circuit can have a protective <b>earth</b> (ground) <b>connection.</b> A PELV circuit, just as with SELV, requires a design that guarantees a low risk of accidental contact with a higher voltage. For a transformer, this can mean that the primary and secondary windings must be separated by an extra insulation barrier, or by a conductive shield with a protective <b>earth</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|R

50|$|In a TN {{earthing}} system, one of {{the points}} in the generator or transformer is connected with earth, usually the star point in a three-phase system. The body of the electrical device is connected with earth via this <b>earth</b> <b>connection</b> at the transformer.This arrangement is a current standard for residential and industrial electric systems particularly in Europe.|$|R

50|$|A good <b>earth</b> <b>connection</b> is {{normally}} a 6 m stake of copper-clad steel driven vertically into the ground, and bonded to the transformer earth and tank. A good ground resistance is 5-10 ohms (measured between which points?). SWER systems {{are designed to}} limit the voltage in the earth to 20 volts per meter to avoid shocking people and animals that {{might be in the}} area.|$|R
5000|$|Grounding is critical. Significant {{currents}} on {{the order}} of 8 amperes flow through the ground near the earth points. A good-quality <b>earth</b> <b>connection</b> is needed to prevent risk of electric shock due to earth potential rise near this point. Separate grounds for power and safety are also used. Duplication of the ground points assures that the system is still safe if either of the grounds is damaged.|$|R
50|$|In a TT (Terra-Terra) {{earthing}} system, {{the protective}} <b>earth</b> <b>connection</b> {{for the consumer}} is provided by a local earth electrode, (sometimes {{referred to as the}} Terra-Firma connection) and there is another independently installed at the generator. There is no 'earth wire' between the two.The fault loop impedance is higher, and unless the electrode impedance is very low indeed, a TT installation should always have an RCD (GFCI) as its first isolator.|$|R

50|$|The {{scientific}} scope of IODP {{is laid out}} in the program's science plan, Illuminating Earth's Past, Present, and Future. The science plan covers a 10-year period of operations and consists of a list of scientific challenges that are organized into four themes called Climate and Ocean Change, Biosphere Frontiers, <b>Earth</b> <b>Connections,</b> and <b>Earth</b> in Motion. The science plan was developed by the international scientific community to identify the highest priority science for the program.|$|R
5000|$|In remote areas, {{where the}} cost of an {{additional}} PE conductor outweighs {{the cost of}} a local <b>earth</b> <b>connection,</b> TT networks are commonly used in some countries, especially in older properties or in rural areas, where safety might otherwise be threatened by the fracture of an overhead PE conductor by, say, a fallen tree branch. TT supplies to individual properties are also seen in mostly TN-C-S systems where an individual property is considered unsuitable for TN-C-S supply.|$|R
2500|$|Because {{they have}} no <b>earth</b> <b>connections</b> they have been or are being phased out in most countries. The {{regulations}} of countries using the CEE7/3 and CEE7/5 socket standards vary in whether CEE7/1 sockets are still permitted in environments where the need for earthing is less critical. Sweden, for example, prohibited them from new installations in 1994. In Romania, when the electrical installation of a premises is being replaced earthed sockets are installed; yet CEE 7/1 wall sockets are still available in hardware stores, and in rural {{areas of the country}} there are still houses being built and outfitted with sockets lacking the <b>earth</b> <b>connection</b> in rooms other than the bathroom and kitchen, following the formerly standard practice in Romania. In Germany unearthed sockets are rare, whereas in the Netherlands and Sweden it is still common to find them in [...] "dry areas" [...] such as in bedrooms or living rooms. Some countries prohibit use of unearthed and earthed sockets in the same room, in the [...] "insulated room" [...] concept, so that people cannot touch an earthed object and one that has become live, at the same time.|$|R
50|$|In most {{substations}} {{the earth}} is used to conduct fault current when there are ground faults on the system. In single wire earth return power transmission systems, the earth itself is used as the path of conduction from the end customers (the power consumers) back to the transmission facility. In general there is some value above which the impedance of the <b>earth</b> <b>connection</b> must not rise, and some maximum step voltage which must not be exceeded to avoid endangering people and livestock.|$|R
