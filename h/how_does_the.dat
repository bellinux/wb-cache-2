25|$|While Don Quixote is {{unconscious}} in his bed, his niece, the housekeeper, {{the parish}} curate {{and the local}} barber burn most of his chivalric and other books. A large part of this section consists of the priest deciding which books deserve to be burned and which to be saved. It is a scene of high comedy: If the books are so bad for morality, <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> priest know them well enough to describe every naughty scene? Even so, this gives an occasion for many comments on books Cervantes himself liked and disliked. For example, Cervantes' own pastoral novel La Galatea is saved, while the rather unbelievable romance Felixmarte de Hyrcania is burned. After the books are dealt with, they seal up the room which contained the library, later telling Don Quixote {{that it was the}} action of a wizard (encantador).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{transformation}} of the thematic structure of Události, the main news segment of the Czech Television. Apart from the changes in the thematic structure, it deals with formal transformations at the basic level. For the purpose of this work, a research sample, which included one week of broadcasting in 1994, 2005 and 2011, was selected. A total of 27 news segments, which contained 341 reportages, were analyzed in the three research periods. A subsequent comparison of data provided answers to <b>the</b> following questions: <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> ratio of foreign and domestic topics changed? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> ratio of hard and soft news change within a single news segment? What was the thematic structure like in the three research periods?

25|$|At {{the systems}} level, the {{questions}} addressed in systems neuroscience include how neural circuits are formed and used anatomically and physiologically to produce {{functions such as}} reflexes, multisensory integration, motor coordination, circadian rhythms, emotional responses, learning, and memory. In other words, they address how these neural circuits function and the mechanisms through which behaviors are generated. For example, systems level analysis addresses questions concerning specific sensory and motor modalities: how does vision work? How do songbirds learn new songs and bats localize with ultrasound? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> somatosensory system process tactile information? The related fields of neuroethology and neuropsychology {{address the question of}} how neural substrates underlie specific animal and human behaviors. Neuroendocrinology and psychoneuroimmunology examine interactions between the nervous system and the endocrine and immune systems, respectively. Despite many advancements, the way networks of neurons perform complex cognitive processes and behaviors is still poorly understood.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Dworkin {{published}} Right-Wing Women: The Politics of Domesticated Females, {{an examination}} of women's reasons for collaborating with men for the limitation of women's freedom. In the preface to the British edition, Dworkin stated that the New Right in the United States focused especially on preserving male authority in the family, the promotion of fundamentalist versions of orthodox religion, combating abortion, and undermining efforts to combat domestic violence, but that it also had, for the first time, [...] "succeeded in getting women as women (women who claim to be acting {{in the interests of}} women as a group) to act effectively on behalf of male authority over women, on behalf of a hierarchy in which women are subservient to men, on behalf of women as the rightful property of men, on behalf of religion as an expression of transcendent male supremacy". Taking this as her problem, Dworkin asked, [...] "Why do right-wing women agitate for their own subordination? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> Right, controlled by men, enlist their participation and loyalty? And why do right-wing women truly hate the feminist struggle for equality?" ...|$|E

Lieder's assertions that the approach of Nibiru would cause the Earth's rotation to stop or its axis to shift violate the laws of physics. In his rebuttal of Immanuel Velikovsky's Worlds in Collision, which made the same claim that the Earth's rotation could be stopped and then restarted, Carl Sagan noted that, [...] "the energy required to brake the Earth is not enough to melt it, although it would result in a noticeable increase in temperature: The oceans would [...] raised to the boiling point of water... <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> Earth get started up again, rotating at approximately the same rate of spin?

500|$|The Conservatives {{did well}} in Atlantic Canada, gaining two seats in Newfoundland and nine in Nova Scotia, and {{sweeping}} Prince Edward Island's four seats. However, in Quebec, they gained only five seats as the province returned 62Liberals. The Tories gained 29seats in Ontario. Howe was defeated by Fisher, and told the media that some strange disease was sweeping the country, but as for him, {{he was going to}} bed. The Liberals still led by a narrow margin as the returns began to come in from Manitoba, and St. Laurent told Liberal minister Pickersgill that he hoped that the Tories would get at least one more seat than the Liberals so they could get out of an appalling situation. As the Tories forged ahead in Western Canada, Diefenbaker flew from Prince Albert to Regina to deliver a television address and shouted to Grosart as yet another cabinet minister was defeated, [...] "Allister, <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> architect feel?"

500|$|New Line Cinema's Toby Emmerich {{approached}} Platinum Dunes producers Michael Bay, Brad Fuller and Andrew Form about remaking Friday the 13th in {{the same}} way they restarted The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise. They agreed and spent over a year obtaining the film rights from Paramount Pictures, New Line and Crystal Lake Entertainmentthe latter run by Friday the 13th creator Sean S. Cunningham. Paramount executives gave Platinum Dunes producers a license to use anything from the original films, including the title. Paramount was given the rights to distribute the film internationally and New Line retained U.S. distribution rights. Fuller and Form said {{they did not want to}} make Friday the 13th Part 11 or 12, but wanted to rework the mythology. They liked elements from the first four filmssuch as plot points and ways particular characters are killedand planned to use these in their remake, which they did with Paramount's approval. Fuller said, [...] "I think there are moments we want to address, like <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> hockey mask happen. It’ll happen differently in our movie than in the third one. Where is Jason from, why do these killings happen, and what is Crystal Lake?" [...] The producers initially expressed an interest in using Tommy Jarvis, a recurring character who first appeared in , but the idea was scrapped.|$|E
500|$|After {{more than}} 15 years of off-and-on development, and {{approximately}} $6 million spent in 18 unused scripts {{from more than}} a dozen screenwriters, New Line finally produced a Freddy and Jason crossover for 2003. One of the biggest hurdles for the film was developing a story that managed to bring the two horror icons together. Potential stories varied widely, from Freddy having molested and drowned Jason as a child, to a cult of Freddy worshipers called the [...] "Fred Heads". In January 2007, Platinum Dunes producers Andrew Form and Brad Fuller outlined their intended goal to bring a Friday the 13th reboot to life. New Line approached Fuller and Form to create a reboot, but because Paramount still owned certain copyrights to the first film, the reboot {{would not be able to}} use anything from the original. Paramount, who wanted to be included in the development of a reboot, approached the producers and gave them license to use anything from the original films, including the title. With Paramount on board, Fuller and Form decided they wanted to use pieces from the early films. Fuller said, [...] "I think there are moments we want to address, like <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> hockey mask happen." [...] Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, writers of Freddy vs. Jason, were brought on to pen the script for the new film, with Marcus Nispel, director of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake of 2003, hired in November 2007 to direct.|$|E
