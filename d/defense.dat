50|$|Chemical <b>defenses</b> are {{secondary}} metabolites {{produced by}} the plant that deter herbivory. There are {{a wide variety of}} these in nature and a single plant can have hundreds of different chemical <b>defenses.</b> Chemical <b>defenses</b> can be divided into two main groups, carbon-based <b>defenses</b> and nitrogen-based <b>defenses.</b>|$|R
5|$|Plant <b>defenses</b> can be {{classified}} generally as constitutive or induced. Constitutive <b>defenses</b> are always present in the plant, while induced <b>defenses</b> are produced or mobilized to the site where a plant is injured. There is wide variation in the composition and concentration of constitutive <b>defenses</b> and these range from mechanical <b>defenses</b> to digestibility reducers and toxins. Many external mechanical <b>defenses</b> and large quantitative <b>defenses</b> are constitutive, as they require large amounts of resources to produce and are difficult to mobilize. A variety of molecular and biochemical approaches are {{used to determine the}} mechanism of constitutive and induced plant <b>defenses</b> responses against herbivory.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to chemical <b>defenses,</b> herbivory can induced physical <b>defenses,</b> such as longer thorns, or indirect <b>defenses,</b> such as rewards for symbiotic ants.|$|R
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the regular season, the Virginia Tech <b>defense</b> {{was one of the best}} in the country.

The Hokies had 23 interceptions during the regular season, second-most in the country and behind only USC's 24 interceptions. The Hokies also found success on special teams <b>defense.</b> In total, Tech blocked ten kicks during the regular season: six punts, two field-goal attempts and two point-after tries. Tech's <b>defense</b> also scored 52 points: eight touchdowns, a safety and a two-point runback of an intercepted conversion pass.|$|E

Additionally, several players were recognized for their individual accomplishments on the field. C. J. Mosley won the Butkus Award as the top collegiate linebacker; AJ McCarron won both the Maxwell Award as the overall player of the year and the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award as the top senior quarterback. Also, four players were named to various All-America Teams with C. J. Mosley being a unanimous selection and Ha Ha Clinton-Dix and Cyrus Kouandjio being consensus selections.|$|E

40|$|Predation {{is a major}} {{selective}} force structuring biological {{communities and}} causing the evolution of <b>defenses</b> in many prey organisms.

Costs for the production or maintenance of <b>defenses</b> are saved during times when these <b>defenses</b> are not required. A fascinating aspect {{of the study of}} inducible <b>defenses</b> is that organisms with the same genotype can display drama ti cally different phenotypes in response to par ticular environmental factors that are required for activat ing genes that control the formation of these <b>defenses.</b> The interplay of genes and environment is far from being fully understood, above all since the gene...|$|R

5|$|Clemson's <b>defense</b> was strongest {{against the}} rush. During the regular season, the Tigers allowed {{an average of}} 101.8 yards per game on the ground, good enough for No. 18 nationally.

In terms of points allowed, rather than yardage, the Tigers were ranked No. 23 after giving up an average of 19.3 yards per game.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{into the}} Gator Bowl, the Virginia Tech <b>defense</b> was ranked first in total <b>defense,</b> second in pass <b>defense,</b> fourth in rushing <b>defense,</b> {{and third in}} scoring <b>defense,</b> {{allowing}} an average of just over 12points per game. The Virginia Tech <b>defense</b> was led by defensive end Darryl Tapp, a first-team All-ACC pick, an American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) All-American, {{a finalist for the}} Lott Trophy, and a finalist for the Ted Hendricks Award. Tapp was considered a natural leader {{both on and off the}} field and led the Hokies' defensive workouts during practice. Tapp finished the regular season with 45tackles (including 12.5 for a loss) and ten sacks.

5|$|In October 1940, Saville flew to London with Chaney for {{temporary}} {{duty as a}} military air observer studying British air defenses, and returned to Mitchel Field after two months to become executive officer at the temporary rank of major of the First Interceptor Command. He began drafting a comprehensive air <b>defense</b> doctrine which combined features of the British system with those advocated by Chennault and himself. Saville was promoted to the permanent rank of major in February, 1941, and from March 25 to April 12, he conducted an intensive course in air <b>defense</b> given to 60 fighter group staff, including Kenneth P. Bergquist, posted to Hawaii's fighter wing. In August 1941, he returned to London and observed British air <b>defense</b> measures until December 1941. During this time, Saville's Air <b>Defense</b> Doctrine draft was reviewed by the USAAC, {{but it was not}} approved or published. Saville's proposed <b>defense</b> involved rigorous round-the-clock coordination between ground observers, radar installations, and centralized command posts to filter reports to <b>defense</b> forces consisting of anti-aircraft artillery batteries, barrage balloons, and fighter wings. Unusually, Saville proposed that fighter wings involved in air <b>defense</b> be completely separate from fighter wings making attacks on enemy air forces.|$|E
