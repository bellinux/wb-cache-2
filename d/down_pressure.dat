50|$|Surface {{distortion}} due to grinding or polishing {{increases with}} the aspect {{ratio of the}} part (diameter to thickness ratio). To a first order, glass strength increases as the cube of the thickness. Thick lenses at 4:1 to 6:1 aspect ratios will flex much less than high aspect ratio parts, such as optical windows, which can have aspect ratios of 15:1 or higher. The combination of surface or wavefront error precision requirements and part aspect ratio drives the degree of back support uniformity required, especially during the higher <b>down</b> <b>pressures</b> and side forces during polishing. Optical working typically involves a degree of randomness that helps greatly in preserving figure-of-revolution surfaces, provided the part is not flexing during the grind/polish process.|$|R

50|$|The mine has a ribbed {{plastic case}} which is olive green, brown or sand colored. The mine has a central raised {{pressure}} pad {{on the top}} surface of the mine, but is designed to operate even with the mine upside <b>down.</b> <b>Pressure</b> on the mine forces air through a diaphragm into a small rubber air bag, which inflates. As the bag inflates it pushes a shutter, which in turn removes the striker retaining lug. The striker is free to impact the detonator.

5000|$|The Gibson Victory was an {{electric}} guitar produced by Gibson Guitars from 1981 until 1983 (although some sources say production lasted until 1984). [...] During the late 1970s and early 1980s, musicians watched Eddie Van Halen play his Frankenstrat and questioned and rethought everything about their instruments. They insisted on engineering advances allowing more speed and playability of skyscraping leads and rock crushing shred. The master luthiers in Kalamazoo responded to these demanding guitarists by designing the Victory. The Victory, a superstrat, was {{radical departure from}} Gibson's image as an old-fashioned guitar maker. MV stood for Multi-Voice. X stood for ten They were created by the Gibson research and development team in Kalamazoo, MI, with the body work by Chuck Burge, and the multi-voice electronics by Tim Shaw. The Victory MV's were available with an optional / special order Kahler Tremolo System. The Victory MV's had a three-point top-adjust [...] "tune-o-matic" [...] bridge designed by  Rendal Wall and patent granted in June 1982. The three post holes in the underside allow {{either side of the}} bridge unit to be moved forwards or backwards for intonation of ultra light to extremely heavy string gauges, and twelve interchangeable individually-adjustable saddles, six standard nylon saddles and 6 optional brass saddles to set the fine intonation and affect tone. The Victory MV's came with a series of specially designed Humbucker Pickups carefully made one at a time on the “center focused” KZ/LP115 PAF Pickup Winder, with high sensitivity and unique tonal signature with fewer turns of wire compared to high production winding machines that produce more scatter and a wider magnetic aperture, Each pickup across the range was different, and specifically designed for the role it was assigned. The location of the Pickups were carefully calculated to provide full frequency response and minimize dead spots by avoidance of string nodal points. Humbucker pickups are inherently low noise because the interference is significantly reduced via phase cancellation, however the Victory MV’s had additional shielding connected to ground with the use of special electrically conductive black paint in the routed out area under the pickguard. Truly silent when it should be. The coil tap switch in the up position is humbucker; in the down position is single coil. Gibson had well established business agreements for over 100 years with the best wood suppliers in the world and Gibson Luthiers had first pick to craft the Victory MV's. The availability of premium old growth wood with tight grain was better in the 1980s than it is today because of new laws and limited natural resources. The Victory MV's body and tri-laminated quartersawn neck was crafted from solid eastern hard rock maple, with a Janka Hardness ranking of 1450 pound-force, a crushing strength of 7,830 pound-force per square inch , and a tensile elasticity modulus of 1,830,000 pound-force per square inch, eastern hard rock maple is extremely hard, dense, and stiff, producing earthquaking sustain. [...] The tri-laminate opposing wood grain neck design strengthened the overall neck and gave more tuning stabilization. Evidence shows that wood improves with age, the polymerization of sap over decades, once the wood is removed from the living tree crystalizes. Aged wood also loses its ability to absorb moisture, causing the wood to become more stiff and stable as it ages… the perfect recipe for a straight, high quality guitar neck, level fret board, and great sound. The Victory MV's Set-in neck [...] and silky smooth rock-hard quartersawn Madagascan ebony fret board required better tools, more time, accuracy, attention to detail, and skill to craft, but produces a warmer fuller tone and transfers resonant energy freely and immediately due to the tight permanent coupling, and facilitates ripples of vibrational energy that round out and thicken the sound, in comparison to buzzy guitars with removable screw-on necks having a metal plate and adjustment shims. The chamfered cutaway offers musicians with large hands better access to play in the top frets. The fourteen degree pitch headstock shape and tuning machine alignment allows for a perfectly straight pull on the strings and optimum string <b>down</b> <b>pressure.</b> The Gibson Victory MV's are not recommended for the weak, these sledge axes weigh a solid nine pounds but are perfectly balanced both on the strap or on the knee, Luthiers know guitars with more mass and density have more brilliance and sustain. in fact some older Gibson models weighed as much as twelve pounds. According to Gibson, Victory MV’s were only produced in Candy Apple Red, Antique Cherry Sunburst, & Twilight Blue. However sometimes a retailer who did a lot of business with Gibson would be able to ask for a small number of guitars with a special finish. Mention has been made of Roy Orbison's special order black Victory MVX. [...] The Victory MV's came standard with a rugged black Gibson branded [...] "8170" [...] dual lock and key padded hard case with internal storage box. Decode the serial number {{on the back of the}} headstock to determine where your Victory was made and the date of it's manufacture.|$|E

30|$|A {{new idea}} of {{polishing}} pad called flexible nanobrush pad (FNP) {{has been proposed}} for the low <b>down</b> <b>pressure</b> chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process of Cu/ultra-low-к materials. The FNP was designed with a surface layer of flexible brush-like nanofibers which can ‘actively’ carry nanoscale abrasives in slurry independent of the <b>down</b> <b>pressure.</b> Better planarization performances including high material removal rate, good planarization, good polishing uniformity, and low defectivity are expected in the CMP process under the low <b>down</b> <b>pressure</b> with such kind of pad. The FNP {{can be made by}} template-assisted replication or template-based synthesis methods, which will be driven by the development of the preparation technologies for ordered nanostructure arrays. The present work would potentially provide a new solution for the Cu/ultra-low-к CMP process.|$|E
30|$|Polishing pads[23 – 30] {{with free}} fibers {{on the surface}} have been widely studied due to their {{numerous}} advantages in the CMP process under normal <b>down</b> <b>pressure,</b> i.e., from 2 to 8 psi. However, the polishing pad with ordered nanofiber arrays on the surface has been seldom reported so far, and its CMP performances under the low <b>down</b> <b>pressure</b> (less than 1 psi or even 0.5 psi) are yet unknown. Previous simulation and experimental works in our group have already indicated that the interaction between abrasive particles and wafer surface has important effects on the CMP performances[31 – 38]. In the present work, a new idea of polishing pad called flexible nanobrush pad (FNP) has been proposed. A large number of flexible brush-like nanofibers which {{are supposed to be}} useful for the low <b>down</b> <b>pressure</b> CMP process of Cu/ultra-low-к materials will be made in the surface layer of the pad. The material removal and planarization mechanisms of the FNP, as well as the possible implementations, have been discussed.|$|E
30|$|With the {{development}} of semiconductor industry, the feature size of device is scaling down, and the density of integrated circuit (IC) is continuously increasing, {{as well as the}} wafer sizes. As a result, the fabrication techniques are facing new challenges. For instance, the conventional silica is replaced by ultra-low-к materials integrating with copper (Cu) for reduction of the dielectric permittivity[1]. Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP), which is thought as the only one that can offer excellent local and global planarization at the same time, {{has become one of the}} most important fabrication technologies adopted by the semiconductor industry[2]. However, due to low density, poor mechanical strength, and deficient adhesion properties, ultra-low-к dielectrics may be damaged by stresses applied during the conventional CMP[3]. The pace of incorporating advanced ultra-low-к materials has been slowing down as compared to the original projections[1, 4]. One solution is to reduce <b>down</b> <b>pressure</b> in the CMP process[5]. However, the low <b>down</b> <b>pressure</b> leads to a low material removal rate (MRR) in the CMP process with conventional polishing slurries and pads[6]. Therefore, it is an urgent problem to be solved for the planarization of wafers by CMP under the low <b>down</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
