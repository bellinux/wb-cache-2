5|$|The {{station was}} the busiest {{stop on the}} Westside line by 1999 {{with an average of}} 3,005 daily boardings. In March 2008, TriMet added {{additional}} capacity during the morning and evening commuting period. This was accomplished by extending three Red Line trains from the Beaverton Transit Center stop <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening during peak ridership times.|$|E
5|$|The Truman {{family moved}} into nearby Blair House during the renovations. As the newer West Wing, {{including}} the Oval Office, remained open, Truman walked {{to and from}} his work across the street <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> afternoon. In due course, {{the decision was made}} to demolish and rebuild the whole interior of the main White House, as well as excavate new basement levels and underpin the foundations. The famous exterior of the structure was buttressed and retained while the extensive renovations proceeded inside. The work lasted from December 1949 until March 1952.|$|E
5|$|The {{capitulation}} of Italy {{also brought}} with it the real threat of an invasion by the Allies of the Dalmatian coast. As a result, on 9 September, orders were received by 1./(Kroat.)KG to execute two coastal reconnaissance sorties over the central and south Adriatic <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> afternoon. On 10 October one of its Dornier Do 17Zs was intercepted by eight Spitfire Mk.VIII fighters of No. 92 Squadron RAF near the coast of Italy. All of the fighters made firing passes on the Dornier, which was shot down, the crew bailing out. One Spitfire was hit by return fire and crashed into the sea, killing its pilot. After this, reconnaissance sorties were confined to {{the vicinity of the}} Dalmatian coast.|$|E

5|$|In 1897 the {{nominally}} independent Whitechapel & Bow Railway received {{permission for}} a link from the District Railway at Whitechapel to the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT) at an above-ground junction at Bow, {{to the west}} of Bromley station. The LT and District jointly took over the company the following year and the line opened on 2 June 1902 with new stations at Stepney Green, Mile End and Bow Road. Some District services were extended from Whitechapel to East Ham and one train <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening ran through to Upminster. In July 1902 four trains an hour ran from Bow Road (2 to 3 from East Ham) to Ealing or Wimbledon and two trains an hour from New Cross served Hammersmith or Richmond. The outer circle continued to run from Mansion House, the GWR's middle circle having started at Earl's Court from 1900.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} initially {{arrive at}} the hospital <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> argue over who will care for a certain patient that arrives each day. A hospital superior {{is in charge of}} assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors. Episodes migrate {{back and forth from the}} doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series. At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.|$|E
5|$|Previously, the Sistine Chapel's only {{ventilation}} {{was from}} its {{windows in the}} upper level of the walls. To prevent exhaust fumes and wind-blown pollutants from entering, the windows are now permanently closed and an air conditioning system has been installed. The installation is by Carrier of the United Technologies Corporation and was developed {{with the cooperation of}} the Vatican's Office of Technical Services. It has been designed to counteract the various problems specific to the Chapel, in particular the rapid changes of heat and humidity that occur with the admission of the first crowds of tourists <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> the departure of the last visitors each afternoon. The air conditioning varies not only the heat but also the relative humidity between the summer and winter months so that changes to the atmospheric environment occur gradually. The air near the ceiling is kept at a temperate level, while the air in the lower section of the building is cooler and circulates more rapidly, with the effect that dirt particles fall towards the floor rather than being streamed upwards. Bacteria and chemical pollutants are filtered out.|$|E

25|$|Many {{traditional}} Yacht Clubs worldwide also conduct {{morning and}} evening colour ceremonies. At 0800 <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> at sunset during the club's active sailing season the ceremony is performed by the launchmen or harbourmaster.|$|E
25|$|All Thai monasteries {{generally}} have a {{morning and evening}} chant, which usually takes an hour long for each, and <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening chant may {{be followed by a}} meditation session, usually around an hour as well.|$|E
25|$|The Amtrak California Zephyr {{passes through}} the City of Arvada {{westbound}} <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> eastbound each evening.

50|$|The Half Moon Bay Review {{has been}} serving the San Mateo County Coastside since 1898. It is {{published}} <b>each</b> Wednesday <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> circulated by carrier, mail, counter, and rack sales to {{homes and businesses}} on the Coastside.|$|R
50|$|St John's {{celebrates the}} Eucharist twice <b>each</b> Sunday <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> has also a Sunday evening prayer service. It celebrates the Eucharist also on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer (Common Worship) {{services}} are held every weekday except Monday.|$|R
25|$|Hunt {{wrote her}} first four books living in {{isolation}} {{in a remote}} hideaway in France called La montagne. With no company but a barn cat who came to eat <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> the people she saw once a day at a nearby patisserie, she was inspired to write by silence and boredom.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the latest}} rules, {{election}} required {{the votes of}} two thirds of those voting, in this case 54. No ballots were taken on the first day, then two <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> two each afternoon. Because there had been confusion at the last conclave in 1958 over {{the color of the}} smoke used to indicate whether a pope had been elected, the smoke would be supplemented with electric lights.|$|E
25|$|The Pacific Ocean has {{a strong}} {{influence}} {{on the coast of}} the region with the cooling Camanchaca, a fog that enters the valley from the west <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> retreats as the sun rises over the Andes from the east. With less than 4 inches of rainfall per year, drip irrigation is used to water the vines that grow in the mineral-rich soil. The combination creates fresh wines with a distinct mineral edge.|$|E
60|$|Three {{more days}} passed. The Senate, their numbers fast {{diminishing}} in the pestilence, occupied {{the time in}} vain deliberations or in moody silence. <b>Each</b> <b>morning</b> the weary guards looked forth from the ramparts, with the fruitless hope of discerning the long-promised legions from Ravenna {{on their way to}} Rome; <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> devastation <b>and</b> death gained ground afresh among the hapless besieged.|$|R
40|$|Leaving your {{dining table}} <b>each</b> <b>morning,</b> noon <b>and</b> evening with your hunger {{satisfied}} is no sure {{sign that you}} are well fed.

5000|$|The Top 9 at 9 is a {{countdown}} of the day's most requested songs. It {{is heard}} <b>each</b> weekday <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> weeknight at 9 o'clock. When this show first aired in 1993, {{it was the}} Top 7 at 7. Currently, it has {{moved back to the}} latter name.|$|R
25|$|In 1790, Robert Cox started {{manufacturing}} fusee chains from {{workshops in}} the High Street, {{for use in}} the gearing mechanism of watches. The work was extremely intricate; the chains were only fourteen-hundredths of an inch thick, therefore children as young as nine, from the local workhouse (now the Red House Museum) were employed in their manufacture. The children were paid 1s 6d for a 70-hour week and from 1802 were being taught to read for 10 minutes <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> afternoon.|$|E
25|$|One {{round of}} balloting was to held the first evening. Then balloting was to {{continue}} {{until a new}} Pope was elected, with two ballots <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> two each afternoon. The traditional procedure is that the ballots are burned, in times past reinforced by adding handfuls of dry or damp straw, to produce white smoke for a conclusive vote or black smoke for an inconclusive one. The straw {{had been replaced by}} chemically produced smoke. The ballot slips were to be burned at noon and 7pm Rome time (10:00 and 17:00 UTC) each day.|$|E
25|$|The {{students}} did chores {{for two hours}} each day: the boys worked on the farm, in the garden or chopped firewood, while the girls did household duties, assisted with sewing, cooking and washing, {{and took care of}} the dining room. The students were provided with three meals a day, and were given plenty of time to sleep and play. Religious study was regularly kept up, and included church on Sunday and praying <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening every day of the week. Every night at dinner, along with singing and praying, every student had to recite a verse, or part of a verse, of Scripture from the Bible.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "KGEZ Good Morning Show", {{hosted by}} John Hendricks and Robin Mitchell, {{is filled with}} national, {{regional}} <b>and</b> local news. <b>Each</b> <b>morning,</b> John <b>and</b> Robin feature as many as 5-conversations with community leaders, local and state officials and our Congressional delegation. KGEZ {{is the voice of}} the Flathead High School Braves and Bravettes and the Montana State University Bobcats.|$|R
50|$|Weekday {{services}} {{are held in}} the Oratory Chapel, with Morning Prayer <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> at 8:45am, <b>and</b> Evening Prayer from the Daily Office each evening at 6pm. Noonday Prayer is offered on the last Saturday of each month.|$|R
25|$|The empress {{developed}} extremely {{rigorous and}} disciplined exercise habits. Every castle {{she lived in}} was equipped with a gymnasium, the Knights' Hall of the Hofburg was converted into one, mats and balance beams were installed in her bedchamber {{so that she could}} practise on them <b>each</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> the imperial villa at Ischl was fitted with gigantic mirrors so that she could correct every movement and position. She took up fencing in her 50s with equal discipline. A fervent horsewoman, she rode every day for hours on end, becoming probably the world's best, as well as best-known, female equestrian at the time. When, due to sciatica, she could no longer endure long hours in the saddle, she substituted walking, subjecting her attendants to interminable marches and hiking tours in all weather.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{the justices}} hear oral {{arguments}} <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> meet that afternoon for private deliberation {{of the cases}} heard that morning. The member designated to write the in a case opinion directs discussion of it by asking the justice seated at the conference table to the right for comments. The justices then comment in turn with the member designated to write the opinion speaking last. This discussion and debate provide the opinion writer guidance to prepare an opinion reflecting the views {{of a majority of}} the justices. Once a justice has completed a draft of his opinion, copies are circulated to {{the other members of the}} court and the Court Reporter. The court meets again before the next session to review and revise the circulated drafts until they receive final approval. Opinions are made public on the last day of each session, usually the very next session after argument, and are published in the Virginia Reports.|$|E
25|$|Located across First Street {{from the}} United States Capitol at One First Street NE and Maryland Avenue, the {{building}} {{is open to the}} public from 9am to 4:30pm weekdays but closed on weekends and holidays. Visitors may not tour the actual courtroom unaccompanied. There is a cafeteria, a gift shop, exhibits, and a half-hour informational film. When the Court is not in session, lectures about the courtroom are held hourly from 9:30am to 3:30pm and reservations are not necessary. When the Court is in session the public may attend oral arguments, which are held twice <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> (<b>and</b> sometimes afternoons) on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays in two-week intervals from October through late April, with breaks during December and February. Visitors are seated on a first-come first-served basis. One estimate is there are about 250 seats available. The number of open seats varies from case to case; for important cases, some visitors arrive the day before and wait through the night. From mid-May until the end of June, the court releases orders and opinions beginning at 10am, and these 15 to 30-minute sessions are open to the public on a similar basis. Supreme Court Police are available to answer questions.|$|E
25|$|The {{broadcast}} {{was considered}} revolutionary at the time. Featuring multipoint, live {{reports in the}} days before modern technology (and without each of the parties necessarily being able to hear one another), it came off almost flawlessly. The special became the basis for World News Roundup—broadcasting's oldest news series, which still runs <b>each</b> weekday <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening on the CBS Radio Network.|$|R
50|$|St Andrew's has a peal of 12 bells cast by John Taylor & Co. of Loughborough in England and {{installed}} in 1965 {{to the memory}} of Ernest Samuel Trigg. The tenor weighs 29 cwt and the lightest 6 cwt.
