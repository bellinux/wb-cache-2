40|$|There is a {{widespread}} belief in the quantum physical community, and in textbooks used to teach Quantum Mechanics, {{that it is a}} difficult task to apply the time evolution operator e it ˆ H/� on an initial wave function. That is to say, because the hamiltonian operator generally is the sum of two operators, then it is a difficult task to apply the time evolution operator on an initial wave function ψ(x, 0), because it implies to apply terms like (â + ˆb) n. A possible solution of this problem is to factorize the time evolution operator and then apply successively the individual <b>exponential</b> <b>operator</b> on the initial wave function. However, the <b>exponential</b> <b>operator</b> does not directly factorize, i. e. eâ+ˆb ̸ = eâ ˆ eb. In this work we present useful ways to factorizing the time evolution operator when the argument of the exponential is a sum of two operators which obey specific commutation relations. Then, we apply the <b>exponential</b> <b>operator</b> as an evolution operator for the case of elementary unidimensional potentials, like the harmonic oscillator. Also, we argue about an apparent paradox concerning the time evolution operator and non-spreading wave packets addressed in previous papers published in this Journal. Finally, we discuss the possible insight that can be learned using this approach in teaching Quantum Mechanics...|$|E
