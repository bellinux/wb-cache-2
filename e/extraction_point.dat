His squad discuss their deployment, {{somewhat}} irritated {{that they have}} not been told what they are being deployed for. However, as they are nearing their Landing Zone at Black Mesa, airborne alien creatures attack the Osprey formation, causing Shephard's Osprey to crash land. Shephard regains consciousness in a Black Mesa medical bay, tended to by the science team, learning that the Marines are being steadily beaten by the alien forces from Xen and orders have come through to pull out.

To counteract {{the effects of}} the field, chief engineer B'Elanna Torres suggests the use of a rare substance called Isodesium, and the Hazard Team is sent on a stealth mission to the scavenger base to steal their supplies of Isodesium. However, the mission is a disaster: despite acquiring the Isodesium, one crewman is briefly captured and another team member is critically injured. As the team attempts to extract, Borg drones transport into the <b>extraction</b> <b>point,</b> killing another team member, capturing Lieutenant Foster and taking the Isodesium. In Foster's absence, Munro is made the team leader. Along with Seven of Nine, the team transports to the Borg cube to retrieve the Isodesium.

Matters are complicated when the Borg corner the team, leveraging their freedom and the Isodesium for assistance against a number of Species 8472 on board, a race highly resistant to the Borg. Although successful, the Borg attempt to assimilate the team; anticipating a double cross, however, Munro has Chang detonate an explosive in a sensitive part of the cube and the team escapes with the Isodesium in the chaos.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the effects}} of {{different}} LiDAR point density on individual tree parameters including tree height and crown diameter were investigated for the coniferous tree species in the Qilian Mountain area within Gansu province, western China. 10 different density data were acquired in field survey area, with the minimum density of 0. 234 points/m 2 and the maximum density of 0. 6941 points/m 2 for per flight. By summing up the different flight data, the different density LIDAR data from 0. 234 points/m 2 to 5. 226 points/m 2 for extracting tree height and crown diameter can be analyzed. The result showed {{that the number of}} <b>extraction</b> <b>points</b> and the <b>extraction</b> accuracy of tree height and crown width arrived at relative high level in point density of about 2. 5 points per m 2. When the point density increased, the increased <b>extraction</b> <b>points</b> and the <b>extraction</b> accuracy of tree height and crown width became slow.

40|$|The two experiments, BaBar (PEP-II) and E- 158, require quite {{different}} beams in the linac at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, SLAC. The first needs damped beams from the damping rings and low energies at the <b>extraction</b> <b>points</b> {{from the main}} linac. For E- 158, an undamped, polarized beam bypasses the damping rings, and gets accelerated to energies of 45. 6 and 48. 7 GeV with 14 % or 8 % beam loading, resulting in beam charges of 6. 5 · 1011 and 4. 0 · 1011 particles. The linac betatron lattice must accommodate energy differences of up to 50 %, 9 to 14 GeV at the one-third point in the linac. Gradually decreasing cell phase advance from about 100 degrees to 60 degrees near the PEP-II <b>extraction</b> <b>points</b> in the linac reduces the chromatic betatron mismatch of the PEP-II beams to an acceptable level. Additionally, pulsed correctors for steering and a pulsed RF phase shifter were installed to have more independent control for the different beams. Two new feedback systems have been implemented, which (a) stabilize the trajectory {{at the end of}} the linac, and (b) dithers the pulsed RF phase shifter to stabilize the beam phase with respect to the accelerator RF crest. A reduced intensity jitter from the gun and a skew quadrupole after the linac, which mixes the blown-up, stable x-emittance with the varying y-spot also stabilized the beam conditions on the fixed target. ...|$|R
