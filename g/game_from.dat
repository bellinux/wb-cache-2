The agreement served to break the Crash Bandicoot franchise's exclusivity to Sony-produced consoles and effectively made Crash Bandicoot a mascot character for Universal rather than Sony. After Universal fell out with Cerny and Sony, Traveller's Tales was forced to alter the <b>game</b> <b>from</b> a free-roaming title to a standard Crash title. Traveller's Tales had to begin development of the <b>game</b> <b>from</b> scratch and were given only twelve months to complete the game.|$|E

5|$|Schafer {{stated that}} they began the {{development}} with the character of Eddie, and recognizing what he should be doing in the game—specifically, swinging around his axe, playing his guitar, and driving his hot rod. Once they found this combination of elements to work well in combat and general gameplay, {{they were able to}} expand {{out the rest of the}} <b>game</b> <b>from</b> there, as these elements provided a means of testing the game to make sure it remained enjoyable. The first major feature developed for the game was the multiplayer element, given that no previous <b>game</b> <b>from</b> Double Fine had included this feature, and was the highest risk element to the game.|$|E
5|$|Sportswriter Fuzzy Woodruff, {{a witness}} to the game, wrote:Under Heisman's tutelage, Auburn played with a {{marvelous}} speed and dash that couldn't be gainsaid and which fairly swept Sewanee off its feet. Only the remarkable punting of Simkins kept the <b>game</b> <b>from</b> being a debacle. I recall vividly one incident of the game, which demonstrates clearly just how surprising was Sewanee's victory.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} mixed reviews. Critics {{praised the}} game's B movie-esque quality, warped humor, and smooth video animation, but criticized the shallow gameplay. The title is particularly notable for {{being one of}} the principal subjects of a 1993 United States Senate committee hearing on violent video games, along with Mortal Kombat. Night Trap was cited during the hearing as promoting gratuitous violence and sexual aggression against women. Toy retailers pulled the <b>game</b> <b>from</b> shelves that December, and Sega withdrew the <b>game</b> <b>from</b> the market by January. The Senate hearing eventually {{led to the creation of}} the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB), the North American video game ratings board still used today. After the controversy subsided, Night Trap was re-released and ported to other consoles. These later ports received more harsh reviews due to the aging appeal of full motion video. A re-release of Night Trap in celebration of its 25th anniversary was released on August 15, 2017.|$|E

5|$|A Nintendo 3DS {{version of}} the game, titled 3D Sonic the Hedgehog, was {{released}} {{as part of the}} 3D Classics line in 2013.
