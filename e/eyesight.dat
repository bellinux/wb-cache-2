5|$|From early childhood, Johnson {{suffered}} from poor <b>eyesight,</b> especially {{in his left}} eye, which interfered with his education. There were somewhat contradictory reports about his <b>eyesight</b> from his contemporaries. He {{appeared to have been}} near-sighted, yet he did not use eyeglasses. His <b>eyesight</b> became worse with age; still, his handwriting remained quite legible.|$|E
5|$|Megabat species {{often have}} <b>eyesight</b> as good as, {{if not better}} than, human vision. Their <b>eyesight,</b> unlike that of their microbat relatives, is adapted to both night and {{daylight}} vision including some colour vision.|$|E
5|$|Allingham {{was awarded}} the freedom of his home town of Eastbourne by the mayor on 21 April 2006. He lived on his own until May 2006 when, one month before his 110th {{birthday}} and with failing <b>eyesight,</b> he moved to St Dunstan's, a charity for blind ex-service personnel, at Ovingdean, near Brighton. Aside from his poor <b>eyesight,</b> he was reportedly in good health, with visitors remarking on his memory and voice.|$|E
5|$|Accipitridae is {{a family}} of birds of prey that {{includes}} hawks, eagles, kites, harriers and Old World vultures. They have very large, hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons, and keen <b>eyesight.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because he {{was unable}} to afford {{university}} tuition, Truman had thought of going to the costless United States Military Academy at West Point, but he was refused an appointment because of poor <b>eyesight.</b> He enlisted in the Missouri Army National Guard in 1905, serving until 1911 in a Kansas City-based artillery battery and attaining the rank of corporal. At his induction, his <b>eyesight</b> had been an unacceptable 20/50 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left (past the standard for legal blindness). The second time he took the test, he passed by secretly memorizing the eye chart.|$|E
5|$|Marseille always {{strove to}} improve his abilities. He worked to {{strengthen}} his legs and abdominal muscles, to help him tolerate the extreme g forces of air combat. Marseille also drank an abnormal amount of milk and shunned sunglasses, {{to improve his}} <b>eyesight.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pandionidae is {{a family}} of {{fish-eating}} birds of prey possessing a very large, powerful hooked beak for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons, and keen <b>eyesight.</b> The family is monotypic.|$|E
5|$|She {{is legally}} blind due to Best's disease, a rare condition. She started {{to lose her}} <b>eyesight</b> {{when she was a}} teenager, having {{received}} the results of tests while she was competing at the U17 national netball championships.|$|E
5|$|The Accipitridae is {{a family}} of birds of prey, which {{includes}} hawks, eagles, kites, harriers, and Old World vultures. These birds mostly have powerful hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons, and keen <b>eyesight.</b>|$|E
5|$|Accipitridae is {{a family}} of birds of prey and {{includes}} hawks, eagles, kites, harriers, and Old World vultures. These birds have very large powerful hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons, and keen <b>eyesight.</b> Fifteen species have been recorded in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Accipitridae is {{a family}} of birds of prey, which {{includes}} hawks, eagles, kites, harriers and Old World vultures. These birds have large powerful hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons and keen <b>eyesight.</b> Twelve species have been recorded in Tasmania, {{while there are no}} confirmed records of a thirteenth species, the spotted harrier.|$|E
5|$|Early in July, Gilmore {{was rushed}} to the {{emergency}} room after suffering from vision problems. He was immediately hospitalized and compelled to undergo surgery after he was diagnosed with a detached retina. Gilmore's campaign was stalled as the candidate was ordered by doctors to restrict travel for an indefinite period. The doctors revealed that Gilmore's vision problems could have deteriorated to the loss of <b>eyesight.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fletcher {{enrolled}} in the University of Kentucky College of Medicine, hoping that a medical degree, along with a military background, would earn him a civilian spot on a space mission. In 1984, he graduated medical school with a Doctor of Medicine degree, but his deteriorating <b>eyesight</b> forced him to abandon his dreams of becoming an astronaut.|$|E
5|$|Gallagher was {{selected}} to compete at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics in long jump, 100m, shot put and discus, but she failed her classification test because the classifiers said the <b>eyesight</b> in her right eye was 0.01% better than it needed to be. In November 2009, her classification was revisited due to deterioration of her vision and she was deemed eligible to compete.|$|E
5|$|Giridhar {{lost his}} <b>eyesight</b> {{at the age}} of two months. On 24 March 1950, his eyes were {{infected}} by trachoma. There were no advanced facilities for treatment in the village, so he was taken to an elderly woman in a nearby village who was known to cure trachoma boils to provide relief. The woman applied a paste of myrobalan to Giridhar's eyes to burst the lumps, but his eyes started bleeding, resulting in the loss of his <b>eyesight.</b> His family took him to the King George Hospital in Lucknow, where his eyes were treated for 21 days, but his sight could not be restored. Various Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Allopathic, and other practitioners were approached in Sitapur, Lucknow, and Bombay, but to no avail. Rambhadracharya has been blind ever since. He cannot read or write, as he does not use Braille; he learns by listening and composes by dictating to scribes.|$|E
5|$|Grover Underwood: The {{guard for}} Percy {{given by the}} gods, a satyr who has been {{captured}} by Polyphemus during his search for the wild god Pan. Due to his poor <b>eyesight,</b> Polyphemus mistakes Grover for a female Cyclops. He is rescued by his friends Percy and Annabeth.|$|E
5|$|Images of trench warfare became iconic {{symbols of}} human {{suffering}} and endurance. The post-war world had many veterans who were maimed or damaged by shell shock. In 1921 1,187,450 men were in receipt of pensions for war disabilities, with a fifth of these having suffered serious loss of limbs or <b>eyesight,</b> paralysis or lunacy.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Capt. Iván Castro (then a first lieutenant) was {{providing}} support by fire during {{a battle with}} insurgents in Iraq when a mortar round exploded close to him leaving him totally blind. He continued serving on active duty in the Special Forces despite losing his <b>eyesight</b> becoming the only blind officer serving in the United States Army Special Forces.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Barr {{revealed}} she {{has been}} diagnosed with both macular degeneration and glaucoma, and thus is gradually losing her <b>eyesight</b> and expects to eventually go blind; she is consuming medical marijuana to decrease her intraocular pressure that is a feature of these diseases.|$|E
5|$|In Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings film series (2001–2003), {{all of the}} elves (including Wood Elves) {{are portrayed}} as fair, graceful, and wise beings with supernatural {{abilities}} like enhanced <b>eyesight.</b> While they facially resemble humans, they transcend beauty, with much longer and finer hair and an apparent inner glow. They also have pointed ears and no facial hair.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, as he {{was writing}} Parts II and IV, Joyce's {{progress}} slowed considerably. This was due {{to a number of}} factors including {{the death of his father}} John Stanislaus Joyce in 1931; concern over the mental health of his daughter Lucia; and his own health problems, chiefly his failing <b>eyesight.</b>|$|E
5|$|Killer whales {{have good}} <b>eyesight</b> {{above and below}} the water, {{excellent}} hearing, and a good sense of touch. They have exceptionally sophisticated echolocation abilities, detecting the location and characteristics of prey and other objects in their environments by emitting clicks and listening for echoes, as do other members of the dolphin family.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{attacked}} {{under conditions}} many considered unfavourable, but his marksmanship {{allowed him to}} make an approach fast enough to escape the return fire of the two aircraft flying on either flank of the target. Marseille's excellent <b>eyesight</b> {{made it possible for}} him to spot the opponent before he was spotted, allowing him to take the appropriate action and manoeuvre into position for an attack.|$|E
5|$|Much of the wordplay in {{the book}} stems {{from the use of}} {{multilingual}} puns which draw {{on a wide range of}} languages. The role played by Beckett and other assistants included collating words from these languages on cards for Joyce to use and, as Joyce's <b>eyesight</b> worsened, of writing the text from the author's dictation.|$|E
5|$|Some eye defects may {{naturally}} {{change for}} the better with age or in cycles (ophthalmologist Stewart Duke-Elder suggested that this is what happened with Aldous Huxley). A cataract when first setting in sometimes results in much improved <b>eyesight</b> for a short time. One who happens to have been practicing the Bates method will likely credit it for any improvement experienced regardless of the actual cause.|$|E
5|$|The Accipitridae {{family of}} {{birds of prey}} {{includes}} hawks, eagles, kites, harriers, and Old World vultures. These birds have large powerful hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons, and keen <b>eyesight.</b> Sixteen species have been recorded in South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The {{auditory}} nerve was also large, suggesting good hearing, {{which may have}} been useful for auditory communication and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed vestibular component as well, which implies a good sense of balance and coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with <b>eyesight</b> were smaller and undeveloped. The midbrain tectum, responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in Tarbosaurus, as were the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve, which controls eye movement. Unlike Tyrannosaurus, which had forward-facing eyes that provided some degree of binocular vision, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its <b>eyesight.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{discipline}} of anatomy {{is divided into}} macroscopic and microscopic anatomy. Macroscopic anatomy, or gross anatomy, is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided <b>eyesight.</b> Gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy. Microscopic anatomy {{involves the use of}} optical instruments {{in the study of the}} tissues of various structures, known as histology, and also in the study of cells.|$|E
5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture forages {{using its}} keen <b>eyesight</b> to locate carrion on the ground, but also uses {{its sense of}} smell, an ability which is {{uncommon}} in the avian world. It locates carrion by detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals.|$|E
5|$|The journal was {{a private}} venture, {{although}} no contributor or editor was ever paid for their work and the editors often had to support the publication {{out of their own}} pockets. Burgess was the first editor and he continued in that role until the end of 1884 when failing <b>eyesight</b> forced him to hand over to John Faithfull Fleet and Richard Carnac Temple.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} forages {{using its}} keen <b>eyesight</b> to locate carrion on the ground, but also uses its sense of smell, an ability which is {{uncommon}} in the avian world. It locates carrion by detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals.|$|E
5|$|When {{diabetes}} had severely impaired his <b>eyesight,</b> he took {{early retirement}} in 1984 and relocated {{to the north}} Antrim resort town of Portstewart, where he continued to write. For many years he was a Council Member of the British Science Fiction Association and, with Harry Harrison and Anne McCaffrey, a Patron of the Irish Science Fiction Association.|$|E
5|$|Adult dragonflies hunt on {{the wing}} using their {{exceptionally}} acute <b>eyesight</b> and strong, agile flight. They are almost exclusively carnivorous, eating {{a wide variety of}} insects ranging from small midges and mosquitoes to butterflies, moths, damselflies, and smaller dragonflies. A large prey item is subdued by being bitten on the head and is carried by the legs to a perch. Here, the wings are discarded and the prey usually ingested head first. A dragonfly may consume as much as a fifth of its body weight in prey per day.|$|E
5|$|An ant's head {{contains}} many sensory organs. Like most insects, ants have compound eyes made from numerous tiny lenses attached together. Ant eyes {{are good for}} acute movement detection, but do not offer a high resolution image. They also have three small ocelli (simple eyes) {{on the top of}} the head that detect light levels and polarization. Compared to vertebrates, most ants have poor-to-mediocre <b>eyesight</b> and a few subterranean species are completely blind. However, some ants, such as Australia's bulldog ant, have excellent vision and are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a metre away.|$|E
5|$|Applicant (license holder) must {{be cleared}} by his general {{practitioner}} as being fit to possess, carry {{and use a}} firearm. The health check includes probes into the applicant's anamnesis (i.e. medical history) and a complete physical screening (including <b>eyesight,</b> hearing, balance). The doctor may request examination by a specialist in case he deems it necessary to exclude illnesses or handicaps stated in the respective governmental regulation. Specialist medical examination is obligatory in case of illnesses and handicaps that restrict the ability to drive a car.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, Thomas {{developed}} {{an interest in}} archaeology, entomology, and ornithology, as well as drawing. In 1913 his family made plans for him to join the Royal Navy, although he failed the entrance exam due to alleged poor <b>eyesight.</b> At {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, Lethbridge was sent to Wellington College in Berkshire, while his mother and siblings moved to Buckhurst in Wokingham, Berkshire. In February 1919 Violet and her children moved to Manor House in Finchampstead, where Jacintha and Bill became seriously ill {{as a result of a}} flu pandemic; the former survived but Bill died in March.|$|E
