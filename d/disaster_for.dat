5|$|The 6th Division's next {{campaign}} was the failed Battle of Greece, a <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> the British Commonwealth forces sent there. While in Greece, Mackay led a hastily assembled Australian-British-New Zealand-Greek formation known as Mackay Force, defending the Klidi Pass at the Battle of Vevi. The Allies {{were forced to}} retreat in a fierce assault by the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler brigade. Mackay was the only Australian general to face the Waffen-SS in battle.|$|E

5|$|The final <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> Villiers {{occurred}} in November, when Princess Amelia died. After her death, Villiers {{and his wife}} attempted to blackmail the Royal Family by threatening (in a letter to her doctor, Sir Henry Halford) to release some of her correspondence, much to the shock of her sister, Princess Mary. The family finally moved out of Cranborne Lodge in 1812.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> the Romanian {{expeditionary force}} on the Eastern Front came at Stalingrad, where, during the Soviet counter-offensive of November 1942, the thinly spread forces of the Third Army (deployed north of Stalingrad) and of the Fourth Army (deployed south of Stalingrad) were attacked by vastly superior Soviet forces and suffered combined losses of some 158,000 personnel.|$|E

5|$|Unable {{to subdue}} Basarab, the king ordered the retreat through the mountains. But {{in a long}} and narrow valley, the Hungarian army was {{attacked}} by the Romanians, who had taken up positions on the heights. The battle, called the Battle of Posada, lasted for four days (November 9–12, 1330) and was a <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> the Hungarians whose defeat was devastating. The king was only able to escape with his life by exchanging his royal coat of arms {{with one of his}} retainers.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{royal decree}} of 1428, Louis I had also ordered that only Catholics be granted {{land in the}} Sebeş {{district}} of Timiş county. As a result of official pressure, many Romanian noblemen converted to Catholicism. For example, {{the members of the}} powerful Drágffy family turned Catholic in the 15thcentury. The Ottomans raided Transylvania {{for the first time in}} 1394. Sigismund I of Hungary (13871437) organized a crusade against them, but the battle of Nicopolis (now Nikopol, Bulgaria) ended in <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> the Christian forces in 1396.|$|E
5|$|After Mitag struck Yap, the state's {{governor}} {{declared a}} 30‑day {{state of emergency}} and asked for aid from the national government. On May29, United States President George W. Bush declared a major <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> Yap, which allocated funding for repairing storm damage and storm damage mitigation. Crop damage from Mitag caused food shortages in Yap and Chuuk, and health problems related to the storm killed one person on Nomwin. Residents and businesses in Palau sent $3,000 in donations and other relief supplies to Yap, as well as $3,000 worth of oil. The state government sent about $2,000 to storm victims. Hospitals in Guam sent medical teams to Yap with blankets, clothing, and medical supply.|$|E

5|$|Because of the South Vietnamese {{need for}} {{security}} which precluded thorough planning, an inability {{by the political}} and military leaders of the U.S. and South Vietnam to face military realities, and poor execution, Operation Lam Son 719 collapsed when faced by the determined resistance of a skillful foe. The campaign was a <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> the ARVN, demonstrating deficiencies in ARVN military leaders and that the best units of the ARVN could be defeated by PAVN and destroying the confidence that had been built up over the previous three years.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the best}} interdiction efforts of Rolling Thunder, however, the NLF and PAVN {{launched}} their largest offensive thus {{far in the}} war on 30 January 1968, striking throughout South Vietnam during the lunar new year holiday. The Tet Offensive concluded as a military <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> North Vietnam and its NLF allies, but it also adversely affected U.S. public opinion, which in turn affected the will of Washington. Fortunately for North Vietnam, many U.S. bombing advocates (including Air Force Chief of Staff McConnell) did not want to risk the one aircraft capable of delivering a lot of bombs in bad weather – the B-52. Without them, there was little that could be done over the north in response to Tet, since bad weather minimized fighter operations until the beginning of April.|$|E
5|$|Dingle, who {{had been}} a member of the Oxford Officers Training Corps, was gazetted second {{lieutenant}} in the 6th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment, which took part in the Suvla Bay Landing of the Gallipoli Campaign on 6 August 1915.

He is commemorated on the Helles Memorial to the missing dead.|$|E
