40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} framework, messages, {{and procedures for}} the Diameter <b>Network</b> <b>address</b> and port translation Control Application. This Diameter application allows per-endpoint control of <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> Translators and <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> and Port Translators, which are added to networks to cope with IPv 4 address space depletion. This Diameter application allows external devices to configure and manage a <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> Translator device [...] expanding the existing Diameter-based Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) and policy control capabilities with a <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> Translator and <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> and Port Translator control component. These external devices can be network elements in the data plane such as a Network Access Server, or can be more centralized control plane devices such as AAA-servers. This Diameter application establishes a context to commonly identify and manage endpoints on a gateway or server and a <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> Translator and <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> and Port Translator device. This includes, for example, {{the control of the}} total number of <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> Translator bindings allowed or the allocation of a specific <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> Translator binding for a particular endpoint. In addition, it allows <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> Translator devices to provide information relevant to accounting purposes. Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document.

40|$|Abstract â€“ The {{growth of}} data {{communications}} has involved {{an increase in}} unauthorized accesses and data manipulation with the resulting security violations. Many methods {{have been developed to}} secure the network infrastructure and communication over the Internet. Since it is impossible to predict and identify all the vulnerabilities of a network, and penetration into a system by malicious intruders cannot always be prevented, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are essential entities for ensuring the security of a networked system. An IDS is software (or hardware) designed to detect unwanted attempts at accessing, manipulating, or disabling of computer systems, mainly through a network. However, an accurate system that cannot handle large amount of network traffic and is slow in decision making will not fulfil the purpose of an intrusion detection system. In this paper, we present a layered framework for building intrusion detection systems which can detect a wide variety of attacks reliably and efficiently when compared to the traditional network intrusion detection systems. Another advantage of this Layer based Intrusion Detection System (LIDS) framework is that it is very general and easily customizable depending upon the specific requirements of <b>individual</b> <b>networks.</b> We, thus, <b>address</b> these shortcomings and develop better intrusion detection systems which are accurate in attack detection, efficient in operation and have wide attack detection coverage...|$|R

50|$|<b>Network</b> <b>address</b> {{translator}} traversal is {{a computer}} networking technique of establishing and maintaining Internet protocol connections across gateways that implement <b>network</b> <b>address</b> translation (NAT).

50|$|The Domain Name System maps its {{names to}} (and from) network-specific {{addresses}} (usually IP addresses), {{which in turn}} may be mapped to link layer <b>network</b> <b>addresses</b> via Address Resolution Protocol.

5000|$|A <b>network</b> <b>address</b> is an {{identifier}} for a node or {{network interface}} of a telecommunications <b>network.</b> <b>Network</b> <b>addresses</b> {{are designed to}} be unique across the network, although some networks allow for local, private addresses or locally administered addresses that may not be unique.|$|R
50|$|Part of NSPR {{deals with}} {{manipulation}} of <b>network</b> <b>addresses.</b> NSPR defines an IP-centric <b>network</b> <b>address</b> object. While {{it does not}} define the object as opaque, the API provides methods that allow and encourage clients to treat the addresses as polymorphic items. In this area NSPR aims to provide a migration path between IPv4 and IPv6. To that end one can perform translations of ASCII strings (DNS names) into NSPR's <b>network</b> <b>address</b> structures, {{regardless of whether the}} addressing technology uses IPv4 or IPv6.|$|R

40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the characteristics of}} the Chinese environmental movement by looking into the roles played by leaders, activists and their <b>individual</b> <b>networks</b> in environmental NGOs. Looking into <b>individual</b> <b>networks</b> is a vital starting point to examine the dynamics of the Chinese environmental movement, its emergence, growth, and future development. Network analysis will pinpoint the relationships among social actors, while simultaneously identifying the dynamics of the environmental movement by examining the key features of <b>individual</b> <b>networks.</b> With the participation of ENGOs representing the emergence of Chinese civil society, the relationship between the government and civil society will be assessed. In addition, the study will also look into the degree of autonomy of Chinese civil society. Using connections is a characteristic of traditional Chinese society, it is also found as strategies adopted by environmental NGOs. This study will investigate whether the use of <b>individual</b> <b>networks</b> will be a long-term characteristic of Chinese society, or whether it only represents the feature of ENGOs in their early stage. <b>Individual</b> <b>networks</b> can function in three aspects, first they are crucial in institutionalizing Chinese ENGOs in the current policy. Second, <b>individual</b> <b>networks</b> {{play an important role in}} the formation of collective identity.

40|$|We {{describe}} a decorrelation network training method {{for improving the}} quality of regression learning in "ensemble " neural networks that are composed of linear combinations of <b>individual</b> neural <b>networks.</b> In this method, <b>individual</b> <b>networks</b> are trained by backpropagation to not only reproduce a desired output, but also to have their errors be linearly decorrelated with the other networks. Outputs from the <b>individual</b> <b>networks</b> are then linearly combined to produce the output of the ensemble network. We demonstrate the performances of decorrelated network training on learning the " 3 Parity" logic function, a noisy sine function, and a one dimensional nonlinear function, and compare the results with the ensemble networks composed of independently trained <b>individual</b> <b>networks</b> (without decorrelation training).
