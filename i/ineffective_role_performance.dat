40|$|Effective {{mental health}} care {{requires}} a high performing, interprofessional team. Among 79 mental health teams in Quebec (Canada), this exploratory study aims to 1) determine the association between work <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> and {{a wide range of}} variables related to team effectiveness according to the literature, and to 2) using structural equation modelling, assess the covariance between each of these variables as well as the correlation with other exogenous variables. Work <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> was measured with an adapted version of a work role questionnaire. Various independent variables including team manager characteristics, user characteristics, team profiles, clinical activities, organizational culture, network integration strategies and frequency/satisfaction of interactions with other teams or services were analyzed under the structural equation model. The later provided a good fit with the data. Frequent use of standardized procedures and evaluation tools (e. g. screening and assessment tools for mental health disorders) and team manager seniority exerted the most direct effect on work <b>role</b> <b>performance.</b> While network integration strategies had little effect on work <b>role</b> <b>performance,</b> there was a high covariance between this variable and those directly affecting work <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> among mental health teams. The results suggest that the mental healthcare system should apply standardized procedures and evaluation tools and, to a lesser extent, clinical approaches to improve work <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> in mental health teams.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to draw from {{multiple}} theories of upper echelons, stakeholder, agency, resource-based view and stewardship to establish the extent to which human capital (other than that of the board itself) in service organisations affect board <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> in those service sector firms. Design/methodology/approach – This study is cross-sectional and correlational. Analyses are conducted using SPSS and Analysis of Moment Structures software on a sample of 128 service firms in Uganda. Findings – Findings reveal that dimensions of employee safety, entrepreneurial skills, entrepreneurial development, employee welfare and employee relations fit the model of human capital and predict up to 69. 1 per cent of the variance in board <b>role</b> <b>performance.</b> The results of this study reveal that board <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> is affected by prior decisions, for example, to invest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities, targeting employees that augment firm characteristics like existence of appropriate human capital. Essentially, an improvement in the quality of human capital explains positive variances in board <b>role</b> <b>performance.</b> Research limitations/implications – Cross-sectional data do not allow for testing of the process aspect of the models; however, they provide evidence that the models can stand empirical tests. Additional research should examine the process aspects of human capital and board <b>role</b> <b>performance.</b> Practical implications – Most companies in developing nations have relied on normative guidelines in prescribing what boards need to enhance performance, probably explaining why some boards have not been successful in their <b>role</b> <b>performance.</b> This research confirms that appropriate human capital, which can be leveraged through CSR ideals of employee safety, recognition, welfare and training in entrepreneurship, consistent with the stakeholder theory, can facilitate the board in the <b>performance</b> of its <b>roles.</b> In the developing country context, organisations' boards could use these findings as a guideline, that is, what to focus on in the context of human capital development in organisations because doing so improves their own <b>role</b> <b>performance.</b> Originality/value – This study is one of the few that partly account for endogeneity in the study of boards, a methodological concern previously cited in literature (Bascle, 2008; Hamilton and Nickerson, 2003). Empirical associations between board <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> and organisational performance would not be useful unless we are able to grasp the causal mechanisms that lie behind those empirical associations (Hambrick, 2007). Thus, this study contributes to literature that tries to account for variances in board <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> and supports a multi-theoretical approach as a relevant framework in the study of human capital and board <b>role</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|R

Respondents were the extension agents operating in this area. A structured interview instrument was used and data were obtained from 112 of the 115 extension agents in the study area;The most important impacts as perceived by extension agents were widespread awareness of recommended farm practices, higher crop production, and availability of farm inputs. The most perceived roles of extension by extension agents were holding meetings, home and farm visits, providing farmers with information and organizing community projects;However, the most performed role was writing reports followed by providing farmers with information and distribution of farm materials. There was high consensus with extension officials that providing farmers with information, distributing farm materials, and holding meetings, home and farm visits were the three most important roles of extension agents;Role and organization theories were used to investigate factors that influence agent <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> which, in turn, affects role impact.

BACKGROUND: This {{is one of the first}} studies to explore the relationship between personality, measured at trait and facet-level and performance using a comprehensive range of performance indicators. METHOD: An online survey of 393 nurses from health-care organisations across Australia was conducted to test hypothesised relationships. RESULTS: Path analyses revealed numerous relationships between personality, measured at both trait and facet-levels, and work <b>role</b> <b>performance.</b> Conscientiousness was highlighted as the strongest driver of work <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> across all the indicators, with extraversion also strongly associated with work <b>role</b> <b>performance.</b> Openness to experience, previously considered a week predictor of performance, was, when examined at the facet-level, related to all of the work <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> indicators. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggests a bandwidth effect, where the personality traits drive global performance while the facets drive specific performance.

40|$|Master of Applied ScienceResearch into {{rehabilitation}} outcomes {{shows that}} people recovering from stroke experience serious role loss. Despite this, many occupational therapists {{working in the}} area of stroke rehabilitation do not allocate time to therapy designed to achieve specific meaningful role resumption or development for their clients, instead focussing most of their therapy upon the restoration of function at the performance component level (Brodie, Holm, & Tomlin, 1994). Occupational <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> is an area of knowledge that has been neglected within the profession. Little is known about the use of the concept by the role performer. A naturalistic study was undertaken to provide descriptive information about the self-perceived occupational <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> of men over 65 who have had a stroke, and to investigate the possibility that occupational role was a construct used by the participants to organise their occupational performance (Chapparo and Ranka, 1997). Thirteen participants were interviewed in their own homes. Inductive analysis of the data produced the following findings. There was evidence that participants did use role as a construct to organise <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> in terms of meaning, personal abilities and time. This organisation incorporated a large degree of choice about how roles were performed. Choices were made in relation to perceptions of environmental demands and informed by previous experience and personal standards for <b>role</b> <b>performance.</b> A preliminary model of self-perceived occupational <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> was developed from the themes identified in the data. The constructs of the model represent the factors identified as contributing to the meaning, motivation, planning and <b>performance</b> of occupational <b>roles</b> by the participants in the study. Each major construct has a number of sub-constructs, and construct definitions were produced. The relationship between the constructs is thought to be complex, and were considered {{beyond the scope of this}} descriptive study. The three major constructs of this model are Active Engagement, Personal Meaning and Perceived Control. The three constructs relate to doing, knowing and being as described in the Occupational Performance Model (Australia) (Chapparo and Ranka, 1997). Active Engagement describes the nature of occupational <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> and is principally related to doing. The construct of Personal Meaning strongly influences Active Engagement and is principally related to being. The last construct of Perceived Control relates to the reasoning of the participant about his <b>role</b> <b>performance,</b> and is principally related to knowing. Perceived Control informs Personal Meaning in terms of the perceived outcomes of Active Engagement. The major outcome of this study has been the detailed identification and description of a number of constructs that relate to both the internal and external aspects of self-perceived occupational <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> for the study participants. These constructs extend the Occupational Performance Model (Australia) (Chapparo and Ranka, 1997) at the role level, and can form the basis of further research to develop a model of occupational <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> that would provide a valuable tool for research and for clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report the results of a study carried out to {{determine}} the effect of governing boards on the performance of Ugandan secondary schools. Specifically, the study investigated whether governing boards (board <b>role</b> <b>performance,</b> finance committee <b>role</b> <b>performance,</b> board size, frequency of board meetings and board finance expertise) have an effect on the perceived performance of the schools. Design/methodology/approach – This study is cross-sectional and correlational. Data were collected through a questionnaire survey of 271 schools out of which 200 responded. The data were analysed through ordinary least squares regression using Statistical Package for Social Scientists. Findings – The results suggest that board <b>role</b> <b>performance,</b> finance committee <b>role</b> <b>performance,</b> frequency of meetings and finance expertise of governing boards have a significant effect on the schools’ performance. Research limitations/implications – The authors measure some of the variables qualitatively and perceptively contrary to, for instance, the commonly used quantitative measures of performance, but process factors which are inherently qualitative in nature can better explain variances in secondary schools’ performance. Thus, in this study, the authors do not claim highly refined measurement concepts. More research is therefore needed to better refine qualitative concepts used in this study. The results too suggest that board and finance committee <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> and finance expertise of the board are more important for performance of a school than board size, and frequency of meetings which academics have been focusing on. These findings call for more research to validate the posited relationships. Practical implications – The results are important for governing board policy development; for example, in terms of prescribing the qualifications for schools’ governing board members and also finance committee board members. Originality/value – This study shows that one way to capture the influence of all governing boards’ roles including service role is to adopt a perception-based approach which asks respondents to what extent they think governing boards fulfil all their roles. Unlike previous studies which used proxies for board <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> such as proportion of non-executive directors and board size for monitoring and control and resource provision, the study incorporates proxies as well as perception-based measures of board <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> to determine if governing boards have a significant influence on the performance of Uganda secondary schools...|$|R
