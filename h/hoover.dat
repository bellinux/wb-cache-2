5|$|<b>Hoover</b> Dam is a {{concrete}} arch-gravity dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River, {{on the border}} between the U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona. It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression and was dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Originally known as Boulder Dam from 1933, it was officially renamed <b>Hoover</b> Dam by a joint resolution of Congress in 1947. Its construction {{was the result of a}} massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over one hundred lives. The dam was named after President Herbert <b>Hoover.</b>|$|E

5|$|On September30, 1935, the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) {{completed}} <b>Hoover</b> Dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River. Behind the dam rose Lake Mead, {{the largest}} artificial {{lake in the}} U.S., capable of holding {{more than two years}} of the Colorado's flow. The construction of <b>Hoover</b> was a major step towards stabilizing the lower channel of the Colorado River, storing water for irrigation in times of drought, and providing much-needed flood control as part of a program known as the Boulder Canyon Project. <b>Hoover</b> was the tallest dam in the world at the time of construction and also had the world's largest hydroelectric power plant. Flow regulation from <b>Hoover</b> Dam opened the doors for rapid development on the lower Colorado River; Imperial and Parker dams followed in 1938, and Davis Dam was completed in 1950.|$|E

5|$|A {{pressing}} issue {{not resolved}} by Wilson {{was the question}} of policy towards Bolshevik Russia. The U.S. had been among the nations that had sent troops there after the Russian Revolution. Afterwards, Wilson refused to recognize the Russian SFSR. Under Harding, Commerce Secretary <b>Hoover,</b> with considerable experience of Russian affairs, took the lead on policy. When famine struck Russia in 1921, <b>Hoover</b> had the American Relief Administration, which he had headed, negotiate with the Russians to provide aid. Soviet leaders (the U.S.S.R. was established in 1922) hoped in vain that the agreement would lead to recognition. <b>Hoover</b> supported trade with the Soviets, fearing U.S. companies would be frozen out of the Soviet market, but Hughes opposed this, and the matter was not resolved under Harding's presidency.|$|E
