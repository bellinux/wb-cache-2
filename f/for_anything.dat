5|$|Both Sherman and McKinley {{sought a}} {{peaceful}} resolution to the Cuban War, preferably involving an independent Cuba without American intervention. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but {{it became clear that}} Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) would never settle <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> less. In January 1898, Spain promised some concessions to the rebels, but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana, McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property. On February 15, the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed.|$|E
5|$|Rocket {{remained}} in {{use with the}} L after the accident, albeit rarely used <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> other than internal engineering duties. The more advanced Planet design was better suited to heavy loads, and Rocket became redundant. In 1834 it was used for experiments with new drive systems, after which it was put in storage. In 1836 it was sold to the Midgeholme Colliery, and used to haul coal until 1844.|$|E

5|$|The {{closely related}} field of letter-preference {{research}} {{dates back to}} the 1950s. In 1985, Belgian psychologist Nuttin reported the surprising finding that people tend to disproportionately prefer, unknowingly, the letters of their own name. The name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens of follow-up studies in different languages, cultures and alphabets, no matter whether participants selected their preferred letter from a random pair, or picked the top six of all letters in the alphabet, or rated each individual letter. Nuttin predicted that because {{the driving force behind the}} name-letter effect is an unconscious preference <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> connected to the self, there should also be a birthday-number effect.|$|E
5|$|The use of summoned creatures <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> {{other than}} a single devastating attack during battle was a {{significant}} departure for the Final Fantasy series. The junction system also acts {{as a substitute for}} armor and accessories used in previous titles to enhance the characters' statistics. Moreover, where earlier titles required weapons to be equipped and tailored to the character, each major character in Final Fantasy VIII features a unique weapon which can be upgraded, affecting its appearance, power, and Limit Break.|$|E
5|$|Washington's {{victories}} wrecked the British carrot-and-stick {{strategy of}} showing overwhelming force then offering generous terms. The Americans would not negotiate <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> short of independence. These victories alone {{were not enough}} to ensure ultimate Patriot victory, however, since many soldiers did not reenlist or deserted during the harsh winter. Washington and Congress reorganized the army with increased rewards for staying and punishment for desertion, which raised troop numbers effectively for subsequent battles.|$|E

5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly elastic (Ed is − ∞), any increase in the price, no matter how small, will cause the quantity demanded for the good to drop to zero. Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue falls to zero. This situation is typical for goods that have their value defined by law (such as fiat currency); if a 5 dollar bill were sold <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> more than 5 dollars, nobody would buy it, so demand is zero.|$|E
5|$|Adam (Peter Krause) is {{stressed}} {{about work}} because his boss Gordon (William Baldwin) feels {{he is too}} distracted by family issues. Sarah (Lauren Graham), frustrated with her children for losing their shoes, off-handedly remarks to Adam about her desire for a LoJack to help locate missing shoes. Put on the spot for new ideas at work, Adam pitches the LoJack idea and Gordon loves it, insisting Adam start developing it. When Sarah learns this later she is excited, but feels upset she is not given credit. When Zeek (Craig T. Nelson) encouraged her {{to stand up for}} herself, Sarah confronts Adam, but claims he has made many sacrifices for Sarah in the past and never asked <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> in return. Later, however, Adam tells Gordon it was Sarah's idea. That night, Adam apologizes to Sarah and offers her an internship at the company's design department, which she happily accepts.|$|E
5|$|For decades, {{rebels in}} Cuba had waged an {{intermittent}} campaign for freedom from Spanish colonial rule. By 1895, the conflict had expanded {{to a war}} for Cuban independence. As war engulfed the island, Spanish reprisals against the rebels grew ever harsher. American public opinion favored the rebels, and McKinley shared in their outrage against Spanish policies. However while public opinion called for war to liberate Cuba, McKinley favored a peaceful approach, hoping that through negotiation, Spain might be convinced to grant Cuba independence, {{or at least to}} allow the Cubans some measure of autonomy. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but it became clear that Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) would never settle <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> less.|$|E

5|$|In December 1689, Parliament passed one of {{the most}} {{important}} constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights. This measure—which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right—established restrictions on the royal prerogative; it declared, among other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> said during debates, require excessive bail, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments. The Bill of Rights also confirmed the succession to the throne. Following the death of either William III or Mary II, the other was to continue to reign. Next in the line of succession would be any children of the couple, to be followed by Mary's sister Anne and her children. Last in the line of succession stood any children William III might have had from any subsequent marriage.|$|E
5|$|Wu {{also has}} another YouTube account going by the {{username}} JumbaFund, which donated {{all of its}} earnings to a charity that viewers suggested. Wu donated over 5,000 dollars to a charity in Kenya, which later built a school after him, {{to build a new}} school in a span of 5 months from all of the profits he made through JumbaFund. He recently cited that he would now donate all earnings from this point on to Kenya in order to help finish and pay off the costs of the new secondary school being built there. Wu mentions this in his video and always records himself donating all the profits to the charity in order to show the viewers that his JumbaFund charity is not used <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> but to donate to the needy.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shipment}} of coins, $130,000 in half dollars, arrived by ship on December 9, 1883. Hawaii {{was still in}} an economic recession. A number {{of members of the}} business community, including Sanford B. Dole, objected to the issue on the grounds that so much silver would inflate the currency, and went to court to prevent the government from giving Spreckels bonds in exchange <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> except gold coin, as the law required. The government opposed the action, which was brought in the islands' supreme court, {{on the grounds that the}} silver coins were equivalent to gold. The chief justice, A. F. Judd, granted a temporary writ of mandamus against the government giving the Dole plaintiffs what they wanted, finding that the coins were not equivalent to gold, and that the coinage and loan acts had been violated. On appeal to the full court, though, Judd was reversed, as the court found that Dole and his associates should have filed for an injunction. But when they did, the petition was denied. In the interim at a meeting chaired by the king, the privy council had declared the new coinage a legal tender; once the lawsuit was resolved, the government paid for a half million dollars in coins with a like amount of bonds.|$|E
