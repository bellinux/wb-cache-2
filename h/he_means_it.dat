2500|$|Peter Roth, in {{his book}} Arithmetica Philosophica (published in 1608, at Nürnberg, by Johann Lantzenberger), wrote that a {{polynomial}} equation of degree n (with real coefficients) may have n solutions. Albert Girard, {{in his book}} L'invention nouvelle en l'Algèbre (published in 1629), asserted that a polynomial equation of degree n has n solutions, {{but he did not}} state that they had to be real numbers. Furthermore, he added that his assertion holds [...] "unless the equation is incomplete", by which he meant that no coefficient is equal to 0. However, when he explains in detail what <b>he</b> <b>means,</b> <b>it</b> is clear that he actually believes that his assertion is always true; for instance, he shows that the equation x4=4x−3, although incomplete, has four solutions (counting multiplicities): 1 (twice), −1+i√2, and −1−i√2.|$|E
2500|$|... "On paper, {{it should}} never have happened. Hunt is Seventies man writ large {{and we should be}} {{grateful}} that species is extinct. He wears a vest and his hair looks like it was styled during a power cut. He runs along towpaths in skimpy orange swimming trunks and has a torso that's closer to a Party Seven than six pack. He has no concept of innocent until proved guilty and thinks it's acceptable to turn up to a swingers' evening with a prostitute he's just busted. He's racist, disablist and homophobic, and he calls his only female detective Flash Knickers. (And <b>he</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> as a compliment.) In fact when you see Hunt's qualities spelled out like that, it looks appalling. [...] the fact remains: Gene Hunt is my guilty secret, and I know scores of other women feel the same." ...|$|E

The [...] "oversized genius," [...] as Archie irreverently titles him, is 275 pounds of authoritarian harrumph packed into a custom-made three-piece suit. A derrick couldn't budge him from that ornately furnished brownstone, where he is an antique among antiques, hovering over his personal chef while cultivating his gourmandise ("I must see about those cutlets") as assiduously as he does his beloved orchids in a glassed-in plant room. … Archie is the only man on TV who wears a snap-brim hat like <b>he</b> <b>means</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Film critic Jonathan Romney {{writes that}} the film has been {{interpreted}} in many different ways; as being about the crisis in masculinity, sexism, corporate America, and racism: [...] "It's tempting to read The Shining as an Oedipal struggle not just between generations but between Jack's culture of the written word and Danny's culture of images...." [...] Romney writes, [...] "Jack also uses the written word to more mundane purpose – to sign his 'contract' with the Overlook. 'I gave my word,' [...] which we take to mean 'gave his soul' in the [...] Faustian sense. But maybe <b>he</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> more literally – by the end [...] he has renounced language entirely, pursuing Danny through the maze with an inarticulate animal roar. What he has entered into is a conventional business deal that places commercial obligation [...] over the unspoken contract of compassion and empathy {{that he seems to}} have neglected to sign with his family." [...] These varied interpretations spawned the 2012 documentary Room 237, directed by Rodney Ascher, which provides an in-depth exploration of various interpretations of, and myths surrounding, the film.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{introduction}} to his celebrated translation of Vidyakara's 'Subhasitaratnakosa', Daniel H.H. Ingalls describes some peculiar characteristics of the Sanskrit language. He refers to the enormous vocabulary of Sanskrit, and also {{of the presence of}} a larger choice of synonyms in Sanskrit than any other language he knew of. Further, he writes, just as there exist a vast number of synonyms for almost any word in Sanskrit, there also exist synonymous constructions. Ingalls writes that in elementary Sanskrit examinations he would ask his students to write in Sanskrit the sentence 'You must fetch the horse' in ten different ways. Actually, Ingalls explains, it is possible to write the sentence in Sanskrit in around fifteen different ways 'by using active or passive constructions, imperative or optative, an auxiliary verb, or any of the three gerundive forms, each of which, by the way, gives a different metrical pattern'. Ingalls emphasizes that while these constructions differ formally, emotionally they are identical and completely interchangeable. He comments that in any natural language this would be impossible. Ingalls uses this and other arguments to show that Sanskrit is not a natural language, but an 'artificial' language. By 'artificial', he explains <b>he</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> was learned after some other Indian language had been learned by simple conditioning. Ingalls writes: 'Every Indian, one may suppose, grew up learning naturally the language of his mother and his playmates. Only after this and if he belonged to the priesthood or the nobility or to such a professional caste as that of the clerks, the physicians, or the astrologers would he learn Sanskrit. As a general rule, Sanskrit was not the language of the family. It furnished no subconscious symbols for the impressions which we receive in childhood nor for the emotions which form our character in early adolescence.' ...|$|E

I give him no other credit, but I give him that." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{children}} who read fairy books, or have fairy books read to them, {{do not read}} prefaces, and the parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, who give fairy books to their daughters, nieces, and cousins, leave prefaces unread.

After reading over his book in print--to {{make sure that all}} the 'u's' are not printed as 'n's,' and all the 'n's' as 'u's' in the proper names--then the author says, mildly, in his preface, what he thinks about his own book, and what <b>he</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> to prove--if <b>he</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> to prove anything--and why it is not a better book than it is. But, perhaps, nobody reads prefaces except other authors; and critics, who hope that they will find enough in the preface to enable them to do without reading any of the book.|$|E
