25|$|DeNeve (1999) {{argued that}} there are three trends in the {{relationship}} between personality and SWB. Firstly, SWB is closely tied to traits associated with emotional tendencies (emotional stability, positive affectivity, and tension). Secondly, relationship enhancing traits (e.g. trust, affiliation) are important for subjective well-being. <b>Happy</b> <b>people</b> tend to have strong relationships and be good at fostering them. Thirdly, the way people think about and explain events is important for subjective well-being. Appraising events in an optimistic fashion, having a sense of control, and making active coping efforts facilitates subjective well-being. Trust, a trait substantially related to SWB, as opposed to cynicism involves making positive rather than negative attributions about others. Making positive, optimistic attributions rather than negative pessimistic ones facilitates subjective well-being.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} exactly how long the Native Americans who {{occupied}} the area that became northwest Arkansas were here before the westward expansion of European settlers arrived. But {{it is known that}} the Osage Indians were roaming on lands north of the Arkansas River. They were roving bands, very venturesome, and known to delight in making war on their neighbors. The Quapaw tribe also roamed northwest Arkansas. They were a fearless, <b>happy</b> <b>people</b> who were more settled than the Osage. They loved fishing, hunting and a more peaceful way of life, unlike the fighting Indians. From the makeup of the Pea Ridge area, it is thought that it fits the mold of the Quapaw Indian. It is known that the tribes of this area were more settled and were actually farmers in their way. The town's namesake wild peas are believed to be a product of this early farming, since it would have taken many years of preparation and cultivation to produce them.|$|E
500|$|Johann Peter Hebel {{was born}} on 10 May 1760 in Basel, where his parents were {{employed}} in a patrician household during the summer. He spent half of his childhood in Basel {{and the other half}} in the village of Hausen im Wiesental, where his father worked as a weaver during the winters. As he wrote in an autobiographical sketch, [...] "there I learned early on {{what it meant to be}} poor and rich... to have nothing and to have everything, to be happy with the <b>happy</b> <b>people</b> and to be sad with those who cried". Memories of both places had a deep influence on his literary work. Hebel's father, who had moved to southern Baden from the Hunsrück area, died of typhus early in 1761, as did his younger sister, who was only a few weeks old. Hebel went to primary school in Hausen in 1766, and in 1769 went on to the Latin school in Schopfheim, where his teacher was the theologian August Gottlieb Preuschen. During the summer months he went to a parish school in Basel, and later to the prestigious cathedral school (Gymnasium am Münsterplatz). His mother died when he was thirteen.|$|E

2500|$|Survival is {{the term}} used for {{what happens to a}} person after he/she has already {{developed}} or contracted a serious illness. [...] Although happiness has been shown to increase health, with survival, {{this may not be the}} case. Survival may be the only area of health that evidence suggests happiness may actually be sometimes detrimental. It is unclear why exactly research results suggest this is the case, however Diener & Biswas-Diener offer an explanation. It is possible that <b>happy</b> <b>people</b> fail to report symptoms of the illness, which can ultimately lead to no treatment or inadequate treatment. Another possible reason may be that <b>happy</b> <b>people</b> tend to be optimistic, leading them to take their symptoms too lightly, seek treatment too late, and/or follow the doctor’s instructions half-heartedly. And lastly, Diener & Biswas-Diener suggest that people with serious illnesses may be more likely to choose to live out the rest of their days without painful or invasive treatments.|$|E

[...] He {{noted that}} aspects of the question had been overlooked and answered the question himself by saying that {{what had to be}} maximized was the average multiplied by the number of people living. He also argued that, if the [...] "average happiness enjoyed remains undiminished, Utilitarianism directs us to make the number enjoying it as great as possible." [...] This was also the view taken earlier by Paley. He notes that, although he speaks of the happiness of communities, [...] "the happiness of a people is made up of the happiness of single persons; and the quantity of happiness can only be augmented by increasing the number of the percipients, or the pleasure of their perceptions" [...] and that if extreme cases, such as people held as slaves, are excluded the amount of happiness will usually be in proportion to the number of people. Consequently, [...] "the decay of population is the greatest evil that a state can suffer; and the improvement of it the object which ought, in all countries, to be aimed at in preference to every other political purpose whatsoever." [...] A similar view was expressed by Smart, who argued that all other things being equal a universe with two million <b>happy</b> <b>people</b> is better than a universe with only one million <b>happy</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E

[...] It is the carpe diem religion; but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of <b>happy</b> <b>people,</b> but of very unhappy people. Great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which Dante saw." [...] More briefly, and with a closer approximation of Wilde's own style, he writes in Orthodoxy concerning the necessity of making symbolic sacrifices for the gift of creation: [...] "Oscar Wilde said that sunsets were not valued because we could not pay for sunsets. But Oscar Wilde was wrong; we can pay for sunsets. We can pay for them by not being Oscar Wilde." ...|$|E
