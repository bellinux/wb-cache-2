5|$|LEMS <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> {{lung cancer}} (50–70%), {{specifically}} small-cell carcinoma, making LEMS a paraneoplastic syndrome. Of {{the people with}} small-cell lung cancer, 1–3% have LEMS. In most of these cases, LEMS is the first symptom of the lung cancer, and it is otherwise asymptomatic.|$|E

5|$|Bulls have a loud vocalization {{consisting}} of screams known as bugling, {{which can be}} heard for miles. Bugling <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> an adaptation to open environments such as parklands, meadows, and savannas, where sound can travel great distances. Females are attracted to the males that bugle more often and have the loudest call. Bugling is most common early and {{late in the day}} {{and is one of the}} most distinctive sounds in nature, akin to the howl of the gray wolf.|$|E

5|$|In natural diamonds, several hydrogen-related IR {{absorption}} peaks {{are commonly}} observed; the strongest ones are located at 1405, 3107 and 3237cm−1 (see IR absorption figure above). The microscopic {{structure of the}} corresponding defects is yet unknown {{and it is not}} even certain whether or not those defects originate in diamond or in foreign inclusions. Gray color in some diamonds from the Argyle mine in Australia <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> those hydrogen defects, but again, this assignment is yet unproven.|$|E
5|$|Matangi <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> pollution, {{especially}} left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta or Ucçhishṭa, उच्छिष्ट) considered impure in Hinduism. She {{is often}} offered such polluted left-over food {{and is in}} one legend described to be born from it. Matangi is herself described as the leftover or residue, symbolizing the Divine Self that is left over after all things perish. As the patron of left-over food offerings, she embodies inauspiciousness and the forbidden transgression of social norms.|$|E
5|$|Matangi <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> pollution, inauspiciousness and the {{periphery}} of Hindu society, which is embodied in her most popular form, known as Ucchishta-Chandalini or Ucchishta-Matangini. She is described as an outcaste (Chandalini) and offered left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta) with unwashed hands or food after eating, {{both of which are}} considered to be impure in classical Hinduism.|$|E

5|$|Occasionally, an individual's tissues are {{resistant}} {{to the effects of}} parathyroid hormone. This is known as pseudohypoparathyroidism. In this case the parathyroid glands are fully functional, and the hormone itself is not able to function, resulting in a decrease in blood calcium levels. Pseudohypoparathyroidism <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the genetic condition Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, one of the longest words in the English language, is used to describe an individual with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy; with normal parathyroid hormone and serum calcium levels.|$|E
5|$|Ono <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the Fluxus group, whose founder George Maciunas was {{her friend}} during the 1960s.

He formally {{invited her to}} join the Fluxus group, but she declined {{because she wanted to}} remain independent. She did, however, collaborate with him, Charlotte Moorman, George Brecht, and the poet Jackson Mac Low, among others associated with the group.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} soil in Leonard Harrison State Park {{is somewhat}} excessively drained Oquaga channery loam, which <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> well drained Lordstown channery loam. Much of the campground near the eastern boundary {{is supported by}} Morris gravelly silt loam, which is somewhat poorly drained due to a subsoil fragipan. The Oquaga tends to be very strongly acidic (pH 4.8), Morris is strongly acidic (pH 5.3) and Lordstown is moderately acidic (pH 5.5). All of these soils belong to the Inceptisol soil order.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Greg Walker and {{directed}} by Barry K. Thomas, marking his directoral debut. The episode takes its title from the famed Greek pre-Socratic philosopher of the same name. Empedocles believed {{that out of the}} four classic elements—earth, wind, fire, and water—fire was the most superior. According to legend, in order to become a god, Empedocles threw himself into a volcano in Mount Etna. As such, Empedocles <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> fire.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{symptoms}} of pituitary apoplexy {{are related to}} the increased pressure in and around the pituitary gland. The most common symptom, in over 95% of cases, is a sudden-onset headache located behind the eyes or around the temples. It <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> nausea and vomiting. Occasionally, the presence of blood leads to irritation of the lining of the brain, which may cause neck rigidity and intolerance to bright light, as well as a decreased level of consciousness. This occurs in 24% of cases.|$|E
5|$|The lichen {{typically}} {{grows on}} rough bark in sheltered and shaded habitats in moist and dense subtropical forests. More rarely, {{it is found}} on rocks or on leaves. In the USA it occurs in hammocks (hardwood forests) and swamps which have standing water, {{at least part of}} the year. It is also common in oak or oak-pine scrub vegetation. The species <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> Cryptothecia striata in the USA.|$|E

Cardistry, or card flourishes, are always intended to be visually impressive and appear extremely difficult to perform. Card flourishing <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> card tricks, but many sleight of hand artists perform flourishing without considering themselves magicians or having any real interest in card tricks.|$|E
5|$|Although Disston's {{engineered}} canals aided {{water transport}} and steamboat traffic in Florida, he was ultimately unsuccessful in draining the Kissimmee River floodplain or lowering the surface water around Lake Okeechobee {{and in the}} Everglades. He was forced to sell much of his investments {{at a fraction of}} their original costs. However, his land purchase primed Florida's economy and allowed railroad magnates Henry Flagler and Henry Plant to build rail lines down the east coast of Florida, and another joining the west coast, which directly led to the domination of the tourist and citrus industries in Florida. Disston's immediate impact was in the Philadelphia area, where he was active in Republican politics and a philanthropist, but his legacy <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the draining and development of Florida.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sterilization}} {{is considered}} a permanent procedure, {{it is possible to}} attempt a tubal reversal to reconnect the fallopian tubes or a vasectomy reversal to reconnect the vasa deferentia. In women the desire for a reversal <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> a change in spouse. Pregnancy success rates after tubal reversal are between 31 and 88 percent, with complications including an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. The number of males who request reversal is between 2 and 6 percent. Rates of success in fathering another child after reversal are between 38 and 84 percent; with success being lower the longer the time period between the original procedure and the reversal. Sperm extraction followed by in vitro fertilization may also be an option in men.|$|E
