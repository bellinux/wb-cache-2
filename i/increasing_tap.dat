40|$|The {{concept of}} the ideotype is applied to trees grown for maple syrup production. While leaf area had been {{hypothesized}} as the controlling parameter {{it had not been}} actually measured, nor had individual tree yield been assessed on a per hectare basis. 	Based on the hypothesis that leaf area and sap and sugar yield are causally related, a basic reassessment was conducted of both crown architecture and the temporal and spatial variation of xylem-borne sucrose production. Destructive sampling was conducted to measure above-ground allometry in 18 trees up to 43. 5 cm dbh. Between 1981 and 1989, up to 86 trees were sampled for xylem sugar following several sap runs each year; of these trees, seven were open-grown and five were harvested at varying heights. 	While crown volume was the best variable for predicting leaf area, it was not as effective as projected crown area or dbh in accounting for variation in sap and sugar yields among trees. Open-grown trees produced the largest amounts of sap and sugar, but when viewed on a per hectare basis, their yield was almost half of the maximum for stand-grown trees. Percent sap sugar was significantly higher with <b>increasing</b> <b>tap</b> height, and while sap volume flow was greatly reduced, it did occur throughout the sap season, and without vacuum extraction, from single taps 14 m aboveground. Within year, the maximum recorded percent sap sugar appeared to coincide with the date at which the regression of the mean daily temperature rises above 0 oC. 	Variation among years is clearly the largest source of variance in sap and sugar yield; however, previous defoliation studies indicate that xylem sugar and starch accumulation or photosynthetic capacity is not coupled. Research reported here supports this conclusion by showing a poor correlation of leaf area to percent sugar. Xylem embolization driven by leafless stem transpiration could be affecting sap yields and sugar concentration not only within the crown but also at breast height among different trees. Wintertime evaporative demand could, therefore, be more important than summertime photosynthesis in determining sap and sugar yield within and among seasons...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTapasin forms {{a bridge}} between TAP (transporters {{associated}} with antigen processing) and MHC class I molecules and plays {{a critical role in}} class I assembly. In its absence, TAP and class I do not associate, and class I cell surface expression is reduced. We now identify two independent functions for tapasin. Tapasin <b>increases</b> <b>TAP</b> levels and allows more peptide to be translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, when expressed in the tapasin-negative. 220 cell line, recombinant soluble tapasin retains its association with class I and restores class I cell surface expression and function, even though it no longer binds <b>TAP</b> or <b>increases</b> <b>TAP</b> levels. This finding suggests that the association of tapasin with class I is sufficient to facilitate loading and assembly of class I molecules...|$|R
40|$|P 73, {{a member}} of the p 53 family, plays a {{critical}} role in neural development and tumorigenesis. Due to the usage of two different promoters, p 73 is expressed as two major isoforms, TAp 73 and DNp 73, often with opposing functions. Here, we reported that transcriptional factor DEC 1, a target of the p 53 family, exerts a distinct control of TAp 73 and DNp 73 expression. In particular, we showed that DEC 1 was able to <b>increase</b> <b>TAp</b> 73 expression via transcriptional activation of the TAp 73 promoter. By contrast, Np 73 transcription was inhibited by DEC 1 via transcriptional repression of the DNp 73 promoter. To further explore the underlying mechanism, we showed that DEC 1 was unable to <b>increase</b> <b>TAp</b> 73 expression in the absence of HDAC 8, suggesting that HDAC 8 is required for DEC 1 to enhance TAp 73 expression. Furthermore, we found that DEC 1 was able to interact with HDAC 8 and recruit HDAC 8 to the TAp 73, but not the DNp 73, promoter. Together, our data provide evidence that DEC 1 and HDAC 8 in differentially regulate TAp 73 and DNp 73 expression, suggesting that this regulation may lay a foundation for a therapeutic strategy to enhance the chemosensitivity of tumor cells...|$|R

40|$|Expression {{of class}} I human {{leucocyte}} antigens (HLA) {{on the surface}} of malignant cells is critical for their recognition and destruction by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Surface expression requires assembly and folding of HLA class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum with the assistance of proteins such as Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) and tapasin. Interferon-γ induces both TAP and tapasin so dissection of which protein contributes more to HLA class I expression has not been possible previously. In this study, we take advantage of a human melanoma cell line in which TAP can be induced, but tapasin cannot. Interferon-γ <b>increases</b> <b>TAP</b> protein levels dramatically but HLA class I expression at the cell surface does not increase substantially, indicating that a large increase in peptide supply is not sufficient to increase HLA class I expression. On the other hand, transfection of either allelic form of tapasin (R 240 or T 240) enhances HLA-B* 5001 and HLA-B* 5701 antigen expression considerably with only a modest <b>increase</b> in <b>TAP.</b> Together, these data indicate that in the presence of minimal TAP activity, tapasin can promote substantial HLA class I expression at the cell surface...|$|R

40|$|Apoptin, {{a protein}} {{derived from the}} chicken anaemia virus, induces cell death in various cancer cells but shows little or no {{cytotoxicity}} in normal cells. The mechanism of apoptin-induced cell death is currently unknown but it appears to induce apoptosis independent of p 53 status. Here we show that p 73, a p 53 family member, is important in apoptin-induced apoptosis. In p 53 deficient and/or mutated cells, apoptin induced the expression of TAp 73 leading to the induction of apoptosis. Knockdown of p 73 using siRNA resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} apoptin-induced cytotoxicity. The p 53 and p 73 pro-apoptotic target PUMA {{plays an important role in}} apoptin-induced cell death as knockdown of PUMA significantly reduced cell sensitivity to apoptin. Importantly, apoptin expression resulted in a marked <b>increase</b> in <b>TAp</b> 73 protein stability. Investigation into the mechanisms of TAp 73 stability showed that apoptin induced the expression of the ring finger domain ubiquitin ligase PIR 2 which is involved in the degradation of the anti-apoptotic ∆Np 73 isoform.

Nitric oxide (NO) {{is known to be}} a key mediator in the normal and inflamed pancreas.  Aims—To investigate the targets on which NO exerts its effect in caerulein induced pancreatitis.  Methods—Acute pancreatitis was induced in rats which additionally received either the NO synthase substrate, L-arginine; the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside; or the NO synthase inhibitor, N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). At six hours, pancreatic injury (oedema, leucocyte content, ectopic trypsinogen activation) was analysed and pancreatic oxygenation and perfusion were determined. A direct influence of NO on amylase secretion and trypsinogen activation was evaluated separately in vitro.  Results—Both NO donors reduced the grade of inflammation. L-NAME increased the severity of inflammation, while decreasing pancreatic tissue oxygenation. Although neither amylase secretion nor intracellular trypsinogen activation in caerulein stimulated pancreatic acini was influenced by either NO donors or inhibitors, both NO donors decreased intrapancreatic trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) and pancreatic oedema in vivo, and L-NAME <b>increased</b> <b>TAP.</b>  Conclusions—NO protects against injury caused by pancreatitis in the intact animal but has no discernible effect on isolated acini.

Methods: Adult male Wistar rats (180 – 250 g) were divided into 4 groups (n = 5) treated as follows: (1) control group (saline solution, 1 ml kg− 1 body weight, i. p.), cisplatin group (7 mg kg− 1 body weight, i. p.). Animals of Groups III received only green tea extract (30 mg/kg/day, by gavage). Group IV was given green tea extract+ cisplatin once daily for 24 hours. Liver function was evidenced in the cisplatin group by the increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The mechanism of cisplatin induced liver function was considered as being decreased the total antioxidant power (TAP). Systemic inflammation was assessed by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels. Results: A decrease in TAP level in cisplatin group was observed compared with control group. GTE administration decreased TNF-α and <b>increased</b> <b>TAP</b> compared to cisplatin group, but showed no significant differences between groups. Conclusion: The results suggested that green tea could ameliorate cisplatin liver function in rats through reduction of oxidative toxic stress and inflammation...|$|R

40|$|Many viruses {{escape the}} {{cellular}} immune response by downregulating cell surface expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. However, infection of cells with flaviviruses can upregulate the expression of these molecules. In this study we analyzed the expression of MHC class I in K 562 and THP- 1 human cell lines that were stably transfected with self-replicating subgenomic dengue virus RNA (replicons) and express all the dengue virus nonstructural proteins together. We show that MHC class I expression is upregulated in the dengue virus replicon-expressing cells and that the binding of natural killer (NK) inhibitory receptors to these cells is augmented. This upregulation results in reduced susceptibility of the dengue virus replicon-expressing cells to NK lysis, indicating a possible mechanism for evasion of the dengue virus from NK cell recognition. Visualizing MHC class I expression in replicon-containing K 562 and THP- 1 cells by confocal microscopy demonstrated aggregation of MHC class I molecules on the cell surface. Finally, replicon-expressing K 562 cells manifested <b>increased</b> <b>TAP</b> (transporter associated with antigen processing) and LMP (low-molecular-mass protein) gene transcription, while replicon-expressing THP- 1 cells manifested increased NF-κB activity and MHC class I transcription. We suggest that expression of dengue virus nonstructural proteins is sufficient to induce MHC class I upregulation through both TAP-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Additionally, aggregation of MHC class I molecules on the cell membrane also contributes to significantly higher binding of low-affinity NK inhibitory receptors, resulting in lower sensitivity to lysis by NK cells...|$|R
