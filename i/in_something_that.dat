After scouting and deciding on locations in the country, many of those areas were destroyed by the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. Rather than choosing another country, Derrickson and Cumberbatch felt that bringing attention and tourism to Nepal following the event [...] "was {{all the more reason to}} shoot there". Cumberbatch said that shooting in Nepal was [...] "absolutely vital to this film, I think not least because it’s so based <b>in</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is exotic. It was a magical way to start the shoot. It’s important to a film like this—which has a profound gearshift into a spiritual and otherworldly dimension—that the portal for that be in a place that actually happens in itself to be incredibly spiritual and marvelous." [...] The eventual filming locations around the Kathmandu Valley included the Pashupatinath and Swayambhunath Temples; Thamel and New Road in Kathmandu; and the Patan Durbar Square in Patan.|$|E

500|$|Along with Beastie Boys, 3rd Bass, and House of Pain, Ice {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} white rappers to attain major success. Chuck D has credited Ice as a regional breakthrough, stating [...] "He broke through in the mid-South, in a Southern area in Texas, <b>in</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was kind of indigenous to that hip-hop culture down there. He just doesn’t get credit for it." [...] In 1991, 3rd Bass released a single called [...] "Pop Goes the Weasel", and in the lyrics comparing Ice unfavorably to Elvis Presley.

Del tha Funkee Homosapien referred to Ice in the lyrics of [...] "Pissin' on Your Steps", which appeared on his 1991 debut album I Wish My Brother George Was Here. Similar to 'Pop Goes the Weasel', the song negatively makes a connection between Ice and Elvis, while saying Ice alongside MC Hammer are mocking hip hop by being commercial. Vanilla Ice answered back to most of his critics in the song [...] "Hit 'em Hard".|$|E

[...] Asked whether a sequel would be a direct prequel to Alien, Lindelof said: [...] "If we're fortunate enough to do a sequel... it will tangentialize even further away from the original Alien." [...] In June 2012, Lindelof said that while plot elements were deliberately left unresolved {{so that they could}} be answered in a sequel, he and Scott had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that Prometheus could stand alone, as a sequel was not guaranteed. Scott said that a sequel would follow Shaw to her next destination, [...] "because if it is paradise, paradise cannot be what you think it is. Paradise has a connotation of being extremely sinister and ominous." [...] Lindelof cast doubt on his participation, and said, [...] "if [...] wants me to be involved <b>in</b> <b>something,</b> <b>that</b> would be hard to say no to. At the same time, I do feel like [...] might benefit from a fresh voice or a fresh take or a fresh thought." [...] Scott said that an additional film would be required {{to bridge the gap between}} the Prometheus sequel and Alien. Scott later stated it would take an additional two sequels to bridge the gap to Alien.|$|E
500|$|In the United Kingdom, the Beatles had {{experienced}} popularity {{since the start}} of 1963. But in the United States, Capitol Records, owned by the band's record company EMI, had for most of the year declined to issue any of the singles. The phenomenon of Beatlemania in the UK was regarded with amusement by the U.S. press, once it made any comment. When newspaper and magazine articles did begin to appear towards the end of 1963, they cited the English stereotype of eccentricity, reporting that the UK had developed an interest <b>in</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> had come and gone a long time ago in the United States: rock and roll. Headlines included [...] "The New Madness" [...] and [...] "Beatle Bug Bites Britain", and writers employed word-play linking [...] "beetle" [...] with the [...] "infestation" [...] afflicting the UK. In late 1963, Capitol Records agreed to release the single [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] with a large accompanying promotional campaign, due to Ed Sullivan's agreement to headline the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show. The Beatles' American television debut was on 18 November 1963 on The Huntley-Brinkley Report, with a four-minute long piece by Edwin Newman. On 22 November 1963, the CBS Morning News ran a five-minute feature on Beatlemania in the UK which heavily featured their then current UK hit [...] "She Loves You". The evening's scheduled repeat was cancelled following the assassination of JohnF. Kennedy the same day. On 10 December, Walter Cronkite decided to transmit the piece again on the CBS Evening News, and the resulting interest led to the rush-release of [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] and—only weeks before the Beatles' arrival—a U.S. commercial breakthrough.|$|E

2500|$|Much of HIM's {{success has}} been {{attributed}} to vocalist and main songwriter Ville Valo.

[...] Vesterinen also singled out Valo's songwriting ability as a major component in HIM's success, stating: [...] "Charisma <b>in</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> you're somewhat born with [...] writing songs on the other hand is hard to learn, if you don't have the talent for it." [...] Juhani Merimaa also stated that with [...] "melodic, catchy and good songs", as well as being [...] "credible in the underground, and the mainstream", HIM had [...] "all the elements for breaking through". HIM also gained many fans through Valo's image, which Sirén described as utilizing [...] "the tried and true James Dean -formula, where sensitivity and edginess combined." [...] With all these elements, HIM garnered both male and female fans around the world, with Asko Kallonen, who first signed the band to BMG, recalling: [...] "For example in England it was hard to grasp. There the split was usually clear: hard rock was for guys, pop was for girls. HIM was listened to by both." [...] Juhani Merimaa felt similarly, stating: [...] "Unlike other metal bands, they appealed to the opposite sex." [...] Lance Teegarden of PopMatters has noted that HIM is [...] "not the sort of act that conjures up a lukewarm response [...] people either like them or discredit them outright". Some of the major criticism directed towards the band have centered around the supposed repetitive nature of their music and pandering towards teenage goth fans. HIM's association with Jackass member and skateboarder Bam Margera has also received some negative feedback.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{initially}} conveyed as an EP, Reinhart expanded Better into {{a full-length}} LP, {{which served as}} her second studio album. The album was released on April 29, 2016. It includes some tracks that were written as demos several years ago, {{as well as some}} newer tracks, including her cover of [...] "Can't Help Falling in Love." [...] The first song Reinhart wrote for Better, [...] "I Belong to You", is her professed favorite song that is featured on the album. She utilized the original productions and fused them with cuts from a live band to produce a final product [...] "with a powerful, meaty foundation" [...] and material [...] "that people will relate to". Reinhart composed the lyrics for some of the tracks with the help of Swedish songwriter Anders Grahn, and her father provided guitar for the album. The album includes themes of confidence and progress; Reinhart states [...] "even {{in a lot of the}} artwork I’m doing, I have roses represented throughout all the photos. I wanted to tie <b>in</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> represents growth and evolution. A rose is constantly growing, blooming, flourishing.” Additionally, she describes Better as a [...] "sultry" [...] mix of funk and rock with a soulful foundation that is crafted to inspire self-confidence and independence in young women, especially through the title track and lead single, [...] "Better." [...] She had already filmed a video for [...] "Better" [...] but delayed its release due to conflicting projects and being presented with several offers from record labels. She did not sign with a label in order to release the album independently and [...] "make sure things were right." [...] However, she professed the possibility of signing with a label in the future.

2500|$|In the Hebrew Bible, manna is {{described}} twice: once in [...] {{with the full}} narrative surrounding it, and once again in [...] {{as a part of}} a separate narrative. In the description in the Book of Exodus, manna {{is described}} as being [...] "a fine, flake-like thing" [...] like the frost on the ground. It is described in the Book of Numbers as arriving with the dew during the night. Exodus adds that manna was comparable to hoarfrost in size, similarly had to be collected before it was melted by the heat of the sun, and was like a coriander seed that is white. Numbers describes it as having the appearance of bdellium, adding that the Israelites ground it and pounded it into cakes, which were then baked, resulting <b>in</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> tasted like cakes baked with oil. Exodus states that raw manna tasted like wafers that had been made with honey. The Israelites were instructed to eat only the manna they had gathered for each day. Stored manna [...] "bred worms and stank": the exception being that stored the day before the Sabbath (Preparation Day), when twice the amount of manna was gathered. This manna did not spoil overnight, because, Exodus 16:23-24 states:This is what the Lord commanded: [...] "Tomorrow is to be a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning." [...] So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.In the Bread of Life Discourse in John's Gospel, the evangelist refers three times to the manna which the Jews' ancestors ate in the desert: the Jews refer to the manna given to them by Moses as a sign of God's promised covenant, and Jesus asserts that the manna was from God and not from Moses, and that the people who ate it were nourished on their journey but ultimately died. In contrast, according to the gospel, Jesus offered living bread, and whoever ate this bread would never die.|$|E
2500|$|The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode the highest grade of the site, an [...] "A". Alasdair Wilkins writes [...] "Steven Moffat’s script is inordinately clever {{in how it}} uses {{the trappings of a}} fluffy, silly Christmas special to crank up the scariness of a good old-fashioned monster story. But after all that, tonight’s episode manages {{something}} that not all of its Christmas predecessors manage, as it anchors its story <b>in</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> feels particular to the holidays. There is a melancholy to the comings and goings that define this time of year, and “Last Christmas” recognises that from its title outward." [...] Praise was also given to Capaldi's performance in the special, [...] "If there’s one thing we never really saw in Capaldi’s first season as the Doctor, {{it was the kind of}} unabashed joy that so animated the 10th and 11th Doctors and made the tail-end of the 9th Doctor’s journey—including his Santa claim to Rose at the end of “The Doctor Dances”—so powerful. Well, it takes the full hour, but “Last Christmas” gets us there. It was worth the wait." [...] Digital Spy awarded the episode a 4 out of 5, stating that [...] "Moffat pulls off a number of difficult balancing acts spectacularly well, refusing to deliver another throwaway special that's heavy on the frothy festive cheer but light on real substance". They closed their review by saying [...] "Last Christmas is an absolute cracker. The festive fun factor is high, as is only right and proper, but it's often been said that Doctor Who is at its best when its roots are showing and here Moffat apes both Christopher Nolan's Inception and Ridley Scott's Alien to provide the viewer with both food for thought and fuel for our nightmares". The Daily Telegraph awarded the episode a 4 out of 5, calling it [...] "marvellously merry" [...] and stating that it [...] "had heart as well as head, so ended like a festive special should: happily, with a cockle-warming cosy glow". The Mirror also praised the episode, saying that it [...] "might have borrowed, somewhat heavily, from a few films, but it still had the Doctor Who spin". They also expressed praise over Clara's continuation, saying [...] "It’s great news that we will have another series with these two verbally sparring" [...] and closed their review by claiming the episode [...] "was [...] real Christmas treat to join Capaldi and Coleman on another adventure, and it was the icing on the cake that Clara is staying with the Doctor".|$|E
