25|$|One {{approach}} to capture {{most of the}} information present in data would be to use many statistics, but the accuracy and stability of ABC appears to decrease rapidly with an increasing numbers of summary statistics. Instead, a better strategy <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the relevant statistics only—relevancy depending on the whole inference problem, on the model used, and on the data at hand.|$|E
25|$|Generally, the {{approach}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the present problem, {{rather than the}} abuse itself. Treatment is highly varied and depends on the person’s specific issues. For instance, {{a person with a}} history of sexual abuse suffering from severe depression would be treated for depression. However, there is often an emphasis on cognitive restructuring due to the deep-seated nature of the trauma. Some newer techniques such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) {{have been shown to be}} effective.|$|E

25|$|Relative to training, a mastery-oriented {{approach}} {{has been shown to}} be an effective way to bolster self-efficacy. In such an approach, the goal of training <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> mastering skills or tasks rather than focusing on an immediate performance-related outcome. Individuals who believe that mastery can be achieved through training and practice are more likely to develop greater self-efficacy than those who see mastery as a product of inherent talent than is largely immutable.|$|E
25|$|If the Southern Maya Area {{is a part}} of Mesoamerica {{delineated}} {{from the}} rest of Mesoamerica spatially, temporally and, in one specific sense – by the still unresolved question of its possibly crucial role in the origins of Maya civilization - one needs to understand that posing this large research question risks falling into ultimately meaningless, infinitely regressing arguments about how “origins” might be considered or defined – essentially arguments about qualitative or inevitably subjectively rendered entities or topics, giving way to questions such as, What is “Maya civilization”? What is “Maya”? What is “civilization”? What allows us to call this or that civilization “great”? One way to conceptualize the quandary of seeking first cause/s is to understand that such an effort leads to infinite regression unless a metaconcept is accepted which, in the case of Maya civilization, is whatever it is primordially that made “Maya” “Maya.” Another way <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> ahistorical processes - environmental circumscription, peer polity interaction, and other theories.|$|E
25|$|User {{submission}} to the database is encouraged. To {{contribute to the}} database, one must submit: contact info, PubMed identifier and the two molecules that interact. The person who submits a record {{is the owner of}} it. All records are validated before being made public and BIND is curated for quality assurance. BIND curation has two tracks: high-throughput (HTP) and low-throughput (LTP). HTP records are from papers which have reported more than 40 interaction results from one experimental methodology. HTP curators typically have a bioinformatics backgrounds. The HTP curators are responsible for the collection of storage of experimental data and they also create scripts to update BIND based on new publications. LTP records are curated by individuals with either an MSc or PhD and laboratory experience in interaction research. LTP curators are given further training through the Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops. Information on small molecule chemistry is curated separately by chemists to ensure the curator is knowledgeable about the subject. The priority for BIND curation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> LTP to collect information as it is published. Although, HTP studies provide more information at once, there are more LTP studies being reported and similar numbers of interactions are being reported by both tracks. In 2004, BIND collected data from 110 journals.|$|E

500|$|The {{stories of}} the core Shin Megami Tensei titles {{frequently}} include fighting against a tyrannical God. The method of story-telling in the series can involve traditional use of cutscenes and spoken dialogue (Persona, Digital Devil Saga), or a text-based minimalist approach that places emphasis on atmosphere (Nocturne). A tradition within the core Shin Megami Tensei series <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> a single playable character {{as opposed to a}} group. A recurring character is Lucifer, the fallen angel who stands against God and is portrayed in multiple forms to represent his omnipotence. Since Megami Tensei II, the series has used a morality-based decision system, where the player's actions affect the outcome of the story. In Megami Tensei II, the alignments were defined as [...] "Law" [...] (the forces of God) and [...] "Chaos" [...] (the army of Lucifer). In future games, an additional [...] "Neutral" [...] route was included where the player could reject both sides. Selected games have been thematically or otherwise linked to a particular alignment. Shin Megami Tensei II, due to events prior to the story, focuses on the [...] "Law" [...] alignment. For Nocturne, all the characters were roughly aligned with [...] "Chaos", which was done both to bring variety to the series and allow the development team more creative freedom. Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse is restricted to a [...] "Neutral" [...] alignment while still having multiple endings. The three-tiered alignment was used in Strange Journey, and continued into Shin Megami Tensei IV.|$|E
2500|$|Another way {{in which}} to read the speech (and the play) as farcical <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the Induction. H.J.

We have been warned." [...] Of Katherina's speech, he argues: ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{research}} group reported {{a case study}} of a single individual with piriformis syndrome whose symptoms were entirely resolved through physical therapy sessions that worked to strengthen the hip abductors, external rotators and extensors. This treatment involved three phases: non-weight bearing exercises, weight bearing exercises, and ballistic exercises. The purpose of non-weight bearing exercises <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> isolated muscle recruitment. Ballistic and dynamic exercises consists of plyometrics. [...] As this was {{a case study of}} a single individual, however, its statistical significance is meaningless and it may indicate nothing important regarding piriformis syndrome.|$|E

2500|$|A third {{assumption}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> planets orbiting Sun-like {{stars for}} increased probabilities of planetary habitability. Very large stars have relatively short lifetimes, meaning that life {{might not have}} time to emerge on planets orbiting them. Very small stars provide so little heat and warmth that only planets in very close orbits around them would not be frozen solid, and in such close orbits these planets would be tidally [...] "locked" [...] to the star. The long lifetimes of red dwarfs could allow the development of habitable environments on planets with thick atmospheres. This is significant, as red dwarfs are extremely common. (See Habitability of red dwarf systems).|$|E
2500|$|A {{special feature}} of {{competitive}} breaststroke is the underwater pullout. From the streamline position, one uses the arms to pull {{all the way}} down past the hips. As the arms are pulling down, one downward dolphin kick is allowed (as of the 2005 season), though still optional; more than one dolphin kick will result in disqualification. This is followed by the recovery of the arms to the streamline position once more with a breaststroke kick. The pullout is also called the [...] "pull down". The pullout at the start and after the turns contributes significantly to the swimming times. Open turns can be easily performed at the walls, but both hands must make contact with the wall. Therefore, one way to improve swimming times <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the start and the turns.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2010, Hip-Hop Press posted {{information}} about Ron Carroll launching his own independent record label called Electricity, {{which is to}} be part of One Entertainment company that will specialize in marketing and promoting concerts, fashion shows and club events all over the world, and signing Electronic, Hip-Hop/R and gospel artists. According to the producer himself, Carroll's goal with the label (which has a major distribution deal with Universal) <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> artist development, music education and ensuring that Electricity creates a solid foundation for the music industry in Chicago. Following this announcement, a house/groove, [...] "In Love with a DJ", with Peniston as its lead vocalist was released in July, including four remixes. In an interview for Great British Life, Carroll said that he [...] "wanted to make a song that gives the perspective of a woman groovin’ to my music, and loving me enough make her night complete.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The Mall of America's {{security}} {{program is}} unique {{and in many ways}} the first of its kind. Michael Rozin, who used to be employed as the mall's Special Operations Security Captain, developed and implemented a behavior detection unit specifically focused on mitigating the threat of terrorism and enhancing counter-terrorism capabilities. Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs) are trained extensively in Israel, each one going through at least 240 hours of training that includes communication techniques, first aid, defensive tactics, crisis intervention, terrorism awareness, and rapid response. As Doug Reynolds, the Security Director at the mall, noted in a congressional testimony in 2008, BDOs are taught to [...] "look for intent, rather than means. The objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> suspicious indicators in three categories: People, vehicles and unattended items like backpacks, shopping bags, suitcases." [...] This methodology has prepared the mall for a variety of threats, both from terrorists and everyday criminals.|$|E
2500|$|Such {{claims have}} been {{examined}} extensively in the peer-reviewed medical and scientific literature; a scientific consensus has arisen that denialist claims have been convincingly disproved, and that HIV does indeed cause AIDS. In the cases cited by Duesberg where HIV [...] "cannot be isolated", PCR or other techniques demonstrate {{the presence of the}} virus, and denialist claims of HIV test inaccuracy result from an incorrect or outdated understanding of how HIV antibody testing is performed and interpreted. [...] Regarding Koch's postulates, New Scientist reported: [...] "It is debatable how appropriate it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> a set of principles devised for bacterial infections in a century when viruses had not yet been discovered. HIV does, however, meet Koch's postulates {{as long as they are}} not applied in a ridiculously stringent way". [...] The author then demonstrated how each postulate has been met – [...] the suspected cause is strongly associated with the disease, the suspected pathogen can be both isolated and spread outside the host, and when the suspected pathogen is transmitted to a new and uninfected host, that host develops the disease. The latter was proven in a number of tragic accidents, including an instance when multiple scientific technicians with no other known risk factors were exposed to concentrated HIV virus in a laboratory accident, and transmission by a dentist to patients, the majority of whom had no other known risk factor or source of exposure except the same dentist in common. In 2010, Chigwedere and Max Essex demonstrated in the medical journal AIDS and Behavior that HIV as the cause of AIDS fulfills both Koch's postulates and the Bradford Hill criteria for causality.|$|E
2500|$|Xi Zheng, then an {{assistant}} {{official in the}} palace library, often visited Meng Guang to consult him. When Meng Guang asked him what the crown prince, Liu Xuan, had been learning and reading {{and what he was}} interested in, Xi Zheng replied, [...] "He treats the people around him respectfully. He is very diligent and hardworking. He has the style of a crown prince of ancient times. When he meets people, he shows sincerity, kindness and generosity in everything he says and does." [...] Meng Guang then said, [...] "This is what is expected of every other person. What I really want to know is his level of political wisdom and how good his political skills are." [...] Xi Zheng replied, [...] "The Crown Prince's approach towards life <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> winning people's hearts and favour. He won't do what he shouldn't do. He doesn't openly reveal his wisdom. Besides, political skills can only be used under certain circumstances; they cannot be cultivated and learnt in advance." [...] Meng Guang knew that Xi Zheng was trying to careful with his words, so he said, [...] "I like to speak my mind as freely as possible. Every time I openly make criticisms, people will ridicule or hate me for that. Although I sense that you don't like to hear what I say, my words make sense. The Empire is not unified yet. Political skills are crucial in this time and age. While one's mastery of political skills depends on his intellectual abilities, political skills can be learnt and mastered through diligence. This {{has to do with the}} Crown Prince's education. He should be striving to enrich himself with as much knowledge as possible so that he can be like a consultant. He should also sit for written and oral tests like academics and gain some titles. This is a top priority for him." [...] Xi Zheng strongly agreed with him.|$|E
