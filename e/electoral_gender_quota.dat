This article examines, from the perspective of a female MP in parliament, the dynamics behind the process of supporting more women assuming leadership positions in parliament. The article argues that the implementation of an <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quota</b> certainly carves the space necessary to allow more women to enter politics, nevertheless, a constellation of factors is needed to work together in order to create the enabling environment necessary for the quota to be effective. Some of these factors include (but are not restricted to) challenging the hierarchical gender relations in post?genocide Rwanda; the political will on the part of the government to engender politics; the role of national machineries in monitoring and pressing for gender?sensitive national policies, as well as the strategic mobilisation of female parliamentarians backed by the progressive new Rwandan constitution...|$|E
40|$|<b>Electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> {{to promote}} women's {{representation}} in politics {{have been adopted}} in both developed and post-conflict countries. <b>Gender</b> <b>quotas</b> result in higher women participation in legislatures {{in most of the}} countries where they are introduced. While a substantial literature explores the factors for the global diffusion in the adoption of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas,</b> such as who is for or against <b>gender</b> <b>quotas,</b> for what reasons, and with what impact, little {{attention has been paid to}} the issues surrounding the holding of elections in post-conflict countries. Elections in post-conflict countries are an integral part of the process of choosing representatives, conferring legitimacy on the state, and developing democratic politics.

40|$|Abstract The report maps the {{diffusion}} of <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> in the 30 EU/EEA countries. In 21 of the countries some type of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> are in use, either legislated or voluntary party quotas. The report evaluates the effectiveness of different quota types in different <b>electoral</b> systems. Some <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> have resulted in major leaps in women‟s representation, while others had led to almost no change. The conclusion is {{that in order to}} be effective in changing women‟s historical under-representation <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> have to fit the electoral system and should include regulations about the rank order of women and men on the electoral lists as well as sanctions for non-compliance. In general, the report reveals a mixed picture in Europe when it comes to women‟s representation. This up-dated version of the 2008 -study (PE 408. 309) shows that women‟s parliamentary representation increased only from 23. 6 % in 2008 to 24. 7 % in 2011. In the most recent parliamentary election in 13 of the countries {{as well as in the}} election to the European Parliament women‟s representation increased, but ten countries experienced stagnation and in seven for the countries women‟s share of the MPs dropped.

Although highly controversial, <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> are now being introduced at an amazing speed {{all over the world}} (see www. quotaproject. org). Having gathered data on quotas globally, it is time to establish a new research agenda to compare quota systems. Comparative quota research might focus on: • the discourse; • the decision-making process; • implementation; and • the consequences of quotas. The outcome of introducing quotas should be studied in quantitative and qualitative terms. Electoral statistics can tell the number of women elected. But, unfortunately, the official electoral statistics of many countries do not contain sufficient data on those nominated by sex, which must be provided through other channels such as through the political parties. The consequences of quotas should also be studied in qualitative terms, looking into the intended and unintended ramifications (for instance, stigma glass ceilings preventing the percentage of women from rising above the quota requirement, or unintended splits between different groups of women).

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of recent global trends in women’s political representation. It describes the different types of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> that have been adopted, and summarises the various arguments for and against their use, as well as key issues and observations about the impact of quotas drawing on recent international research. The paper concludes with an examination of the current status of <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> in Australia, and presents a comparative survey of quota systems in Commonwealth countries including Australia (Appendix 3). Executive summary Less than one in five parliamentarians across the world are women. Legal or voluntary <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> are used in {{more than half of the}} world’s countries as the most effective mechanism for increasing women’s political representation. Electoral quotas have gained international support and have proven to be effective in ‘fast-tracking’ women’s political representation to produce equality of results, not just equality of opportunity. Their introduction has been controversial in some countries, particularly in liberal democracies where critics oppose them on the basis that they discriminate against men and undermine the selection of candidates or parliamentarians on the basis of merit. <b>Gender</b> <b>quota</b> systems differ in type and application. The main systems in use are reserved seats, legal candidate quotas, and voluntary political party quotas. The success of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> is influenced by various factors including the nature of the political system, the type of electoral or voting system, the type of quota system adopted, cultural attitudes towards the role of women in society, and the nature of the parliamentary environment itself. In 2012 the Australian Government committed $ 320 million to support a 10 -year initiative to ‘empower women and to promote gender equality in the Pacific’ region, which has the world’s lowest proportion of women parliamentarians...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} more than two decades, {{political}} parties and governments across sub-Saharan Africa have adopted <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> for parliament at an astonishing rate – and with remarkable success as many sub-Saharan African countries have catapulted to the top in terms of women’s representation in a single or lower house of parliament. During a first wave in East and Southern Africa, quotas were adopted {{in the aftermath of}} conflicts {{and in the course of}} political transitions as mobilized national women’s movements, influenced by an international women’s movement and international norms, took advantage of political openings to press for the adoption of quotas through new constitutions or new electoral laws. In some cases a clear diffusion effect was at play between political movements that closely influenced one another. During a second wave mostly, though not only, in West Africa, quotas are again being adopted as women’s movements, in collaboration with regional, continental and international organizations, similarly press for an increased representation of women during constitutional reform processes or through revisions to electoral laws. During this second wave, creative quota designs have emerged as parties and governments have sought to strengthen existing <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> or adopt them for the first time. This paper examines some innovations in quota design and quota use in three sub-Saharan African cases that are part of the second wave, including the move to gender parity and the possibility of an only ‘temporary’ special measure...|$|R
40|$|In 2007 Spain {{introduced}} statutory electoral {{and corporate}} board <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> {{as part of}} a broader gender equality programme.

This paper seeks to tease out why corporate board <b>quotas</b> lag behind <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas.</b> To explain this differential approach to <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> we assess the broader institutional configuration affecting these reform processes by looking at the obstacles and enabling (national and international) factors, the actors and networks pushing for or resisting each of the quota reforms as well as their framing strategies.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> affect citizens' {{attitudes and behavior}} towards women in political office. A policy experiment with the random assignment of local-level single-member electoral districts reserved for female community councilors in the southern African nation of Lesotho provides causal evidence to this line of inquiry. Using a unique dataset by merging Afro-barometer surveys with archival data, I first exploit the random assignment of Lesotho's quota policy to examine how the policy changes female citizens' engagement with local politics. Counterintuitively, I find that female citizens are less politically engaged under quota-mandated female representation, but present evidence that this result likely stems from the perceived illegitimacy of the quota policy. This dissertation then examines how the quota affects citizens' perceptions of local chiefs. I find that exposure to quota-mandated female representatives significantly reduces the perceived influence of the predominately male chieftaincy in structuring local governance. Finally, I present results from survey data as well as field experimental tests conducted in Lesotho to reveal how the quota has affected citizens' explicit and implicit gender biases, both in the political sphere and more broadly. Here, I find that exposure to quota-mandated representatives weakens young women's preferences for male politicians by challenging existing stereotypes around appropriate gender roles. By examining how quotas mediate the symbolic effects of greater numbers of women in politics, this dissertation develops new theoretical insights into {{the ways in which}} quotas fit into classic theories of political representation. This task is particularly relevant given the rapid pace with which countries continue to adopt <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> at both the national and subnational levels...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{the number}} of {{countries}} that have introduced <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> {{in order to improve}} women’s political representation has been increasing rapidly.

This analysis finds that <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> have a positive significance in post-conflict societies. However, since <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> are controversial, it is important and necessary to hold wide-ranging discussions to determine the most appropriate way, paying due consideration to free and fair elections among NGO and politicians. It is preferable to seek assistance from the Electoral Assistance Division of the United Nations Department of Political Affairs. The international community would need to provide assistance to formulate and facilitate these discussions. At the same time, the international community would need to demonstrate that without the women’s political participation, democracy could never be established.

40|$|Progress towards gender {{equality}} {{in politics is}} striking. With the help of <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> in 130 + countries, women’s national legislative representation {{more than doubled in}} the last 20 years. Other historically marginalized groups – racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, immigrants, and indigenous peoples – are also increasingly making their way into our parliaments. Political institutions are, then, more inclusive today than they have ever been. Yet, equal representation has not been fully realized: some marginalized groups have seen a decline, and men from dominant social and economic groups – hereafter ‘elite men’ – remain numerically dominant.

40|$|To date, {{more than}} 100 {{countries}} have implemented {{some type of}} quota for women in their national legislatures, leading {{to one of the}} most significant developments in the global composition of legislative bodies in the past twenty-five years. One remaining puzzle in understanding the global diffusion of <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> is the strong clustering of shared domestic quota policies by region. In this project, I examine the importance of dyadic relationships between countries, including shared membership in inter-governmental organizations (IGOs), regional organizations (ROs), and women’s international non-governmental organizations(WINGOs) in explaining the timing and type of quota adoption. To do this, I employ a social network approach to quantitatively model global and temporal trends in <b>gender</b> <b>quota</b> adoption. Controlling for other possible domestic and transnational determinants, my results indicate that the strongest predictor of quota policy adoption and design is the existence of similar policies in neighboring countries. These results suggest that, in the case of <b>gender</b> <b>quota</b> adoption, domestic policymakers see surrounding states as their most salient reference group when deciding both whether and how to implement new policy...|$|R
40|$|Once {{a country}} {{allergic}} to {{any type of}} preferential treatment or quota measure for women, France has become a country that applies <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> to regulate women's presence and representation in politics, the business sector, public bodies, public administration, and even some civil society organizations. While research has concentrated on the adoption of <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> in many countries and their international diffusion, few studies focus on explaining the successful diffusion of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> from politics to other domains in the same country.

40|$|Gender {{equality}} in elected office {{has become a}} commitment of national governments and international organizations around the globe. To date, much of the discussion has revolved around <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> – policies that set aside seats in political assemblies for women or require that political parties nominate {{a certain percentage of}} female candidates. Focusing exclusively on quotas, however, obscures the broader range of efforts around the world to bring more women into political office. This article surveys non-quota strategies used globally, developing an analytic framework for theorizing potential interventions into candidate selection and election processes. Whether used in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, quotas, the diversity of these measures points to a wide array of creative solutions, engaging a variety of actors, which might be pursued to enhance women’s political representation. Future research should focus on evaluating the effects of these policies, both alongside and separately from quota policies...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the multilevel governance structure in Spain.

The article looks at three key fields of gender equality public intervention and scholarly research: <b>gender</b> mainstreaming, <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> and policies against gender-based violence. Our results align with the conditional approach of the gender and federalism scholarship. While competition has stimulated policy diffusion across regions and feminist agency has frequently benefited from the multilevel opportunity structure, the lack of well-established intergovernmental mechanisms has brought about negative side-effects like ‘patchwork’ policies that fail to guarantee equal rights for all Spanish women. The article also shows that territorial interests have not trumped gender equality since the most advanced policies are found in regions with the highest territorial saliency...|$|R

The research covers eight parties in Belgium, and is articulated around three central questions in the research field of candidate selection. First, it analyses the composition of selectorates, in particular in terms of gender. Second, it aims to grasp the mechanisms at work in the within-party processes of candidate selection that facilitate or bar access for women to the lists, focusing on the implementation of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> rules Third, it examines the outcome of the selection process, namely to what extent women are selected as candidates (on eligible places). For each question, the paper takes a comparative perspective along two lines of comparison. On the one hand it looks at potential differences that may exist between Flemish and francophone political parties – as the latter operate within the same set of institutional rules, and yet may differ in their implementation of <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas.</b> On the other hand it looks for differences depending on the parties’ ideological position, with a focus on the left-right ideological continuum. Using data from both face-to-face interviews among Belgian politicians (female and male) and party statutes, the paper qualitatively uncovers the actual mechanisms at work within the respective party organisations...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} impact of <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> in post-war Burundi and Rwanda on women's {{political}} representation. First, we look at descriptive representation by studying the number of female representatives and the prestige of their positions in the legislative and executive branches of government. Second, we focus on political representation as perceived by ordinary women, before, during, and after the introduction of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas.</b> We find that, both in Rwanda and Burundi, descriptive female political representation significantly increased {{with the introduction of}} <b>gender</b> <b>quotas,</b> with the share of women in parliament and ministries consistently exceeding 30 per cent. While women still disproportionally end up in ministries of relatively lower prestige, the gap with men is closing as more women have joined the executive branches of power. We do not find any tangible effect on women's perceived political representation. Among the possible explanations, we discuss the authoritarian nature of the regime and the crowding out of gender identity by ethnic identity. We argue that these explanations are not entirely consistent with our data and put forward a third explanation, i. e. that the perception of political representation depends on the implementation of policies - thus substantive representation, not descriptive representation - and that men and women are to a very large extent appreciative of the same policies...|$|R
40|$|The ‘fast track’ {{approach}} for increasing women’s representation in politics through {{the adoption of}} <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> has replaced the ‘incremental approach’ (waiting for cultural, political and socioeconomic developments over time) in recent years. Scholars have disagreed whether increasing women’s representation in sub-Saharan Africa where legislatures are weak and executives are strong is meaningless or may even undermine democracy; or increasing women’s representation results in significant substantive or symbolic representation effects. This article compares two divergent cases: Botswana, a stable multiparty democracy in southern Africa and Rwanda, an increasingly authoritarian single party dominant state in east Africa. In Botswana, <b>gender</b> <b>quota</b> campaigns have raised awareness but have been unsuccessful in achieving quotas, and women’s parliamentary representation is low and continues to fall. In Rwanda, a constitutional <b>gender</b> <b>quota,</b> including reserved seats combined with voluntary party quotas for women {{have resulted in a}} majority female lower house of parliament—the only such parliament in the world. These cases suggest that a democratic state is not necessarily more likely to adopt <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> or have more women in parliament than a less democratic one and that there are other factors that are more important in determining both. Moreover, in single party dominant systems with limited democracy, like Rwanda, elected women are able to represent women 2 ̆ 7 s interests. And campaigns to adopt quotas, even when unsuccessful as in democratic Botswana, can contribute to substantive and symbolic representation effects even with only limited descriptive representation. Thus, the conditions under which {{and the ways in which}} women 2 ̆ 7 s interests are represented must be understood broadly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Today quotas {{are being}} {{introduced}} {{in countries where}} women only constitute a small minority in parliament, {{and the world is}} witnessing historical transformations in women‘s representation, for example from 19 per cent women in parliament to 35 in one election (Costa Rica) or 36 per cent women in the very first democratic parliamentary election (South Africa). Such great historical fundamental changes might not occur without quota provisions, but the focus here is on <b>electoral</b> <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> as a special measure to increase women representation. It is argued that a new international discourse on women in institutional politics is an important factor behind recent introduction of quotas all over the world, even in countries that previously had a very low representation of women. However, the fact that some countries have opened up for quotas, while others have not, and secondly, the fact that specific types of quota systems do seem to occur in regional clusters, all point to the need for contextual based research about what we will call the translation of this international discourse into individual countries and regions, and about the mechanisms behind the introduction of quotas nationally.

40|$|Do {{parties that}} {{represent}} ethnic minorities tend to exclude women? There {{are several reasons}} {{to think that this}} may be the case. First, the comparatively smaller size of ethnic parties could exclude women, especially under proportional representation. Second, the subcultures of many ethnic minorities are often more patriarchal than the majority culture, and thus parties representing such groups may include fewer women. Finally, an ideological fixation on ethnicity within ethnic parties may marginalize submi norities within the target group. Using a new crossnational data set, the authors examine the degree to which ethnic parties represent women, controlling for party size, <b>electoral</b> systems, <b>gender</b> <b>quotas,</b> ideology, and democratic development. Findings show that ethnic parties, particularly those appealing to a religious minority, tend to elect fewer women, but only under proportional representation electoral systems.

We consider whether electoral competition has a differential {{impact on the}} electoral fortunes {{of male and female}} quality candidates. This study uses an original data set containing detailed candidate information for U. S. House open seat primary and general elections between 1994 and 2004. The results indicate that when multiple quality candidates enter the race, female quality candidates are at a greater disadvantage when compared to their male counterparts. The results suggest that null findings from previous work are a product of the way the relationship between <b>gender</b> and <b>electoral</b> outcomes is typically modeled. Worldwide, a mere 21 percent of the members of national legislative bodies are female (IPU 2013). In some regions of the world, women have fared better in their efforts to be elected to their national governing body.

This finding contradicts some previous studies, and underlines the importance of a longitudinal approach when examining the {{percentage of women}} in national parliaments. Sosioeconomic factors are found to have conditional effects on {{the percentage of women}} in parliments. The percentage of women in paid labor is found to have a positive effect only in the Nordic region, while the percentage of women who enroll to higher education only have a positive effect in countries with proportional electoral systems. Findings of conditional effect of female labor force participation warrents further study. The problem of quantifying cultural factors in a satisfying manner persists for this longitudinal study. Catholic religious dominance is found not to have explanatory value once regional differences are controlled for. Previous studies have consistently found positive effects of Nordic countries when controlling for regions. In this study however, no statistically significant effect of Nordic countries compared to English-speaking countries is found once institutional and sosioeconomic factors are controlled for. Instead, the Continental European region is distinguished by a negative effect on the pecentage of women in national parliaments. These findings contributes to understanding the dynamics of political representation of women both by reinforcing and challenging previous findings...|$|R
40|$|During Latin America’s {{transition}} to democracy in the 1990 s, women (and other traditionally marginalized groups) made new demands on their political system for better representation. To resolve issues of representation, legislative <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> were implemented across the region. Although twenty years have since passed, the impact of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> is still under question. The current literature on <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> measures their impact on women’s political participation, descriptive representation, and symbolic representation. The current literature is inconclusive on what real impact <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> have on female citizens. I review how <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> impact <b>gender</b> violence legislation and conclude {{that there is a}} positive relationship between the strength of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> and the strength of gender violence legislation. While the relationship is not especially strong, the relationship shows that <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> do make an impact in regard to gender violence legislation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether the {{recently}} adopted law on <b>gender</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>quotas</b> marks a change in the approach to gender issues and gender equality in Poland. It also aims to describe the trajectory of women’s movement in a post-Communist country and to identify causes related to the role of women in the Solidarity movement that resulted in low visibility of women in government and decision-making positions. The paper departs from the assumption that Poland is not moving away from a narrowly conceived equal rights/opportunities model, because such model has not yet been fully implemented. In the context of the present ‘war on gender’, women’s full political, economic, social, and more specifically, private citizenship is a long-term project. As of now, women remain instrumental for achieving political parties’ further aims, and any gestures that seem to advance women’s position in the public sphere are usually merely symbolic. Yet, the emergence of a strong women’s movement helps to frame the public discourse in gendered terms and gradually include its propositions in the mainstream policy...|$|R
40|$|Given their {{potential}} to negatively impact menâs goal {{of staying in}} office, can <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> be aligned with the preferences of male legislators who adopt the policy? In other words, does the rapid spread of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> worldwide challenge notions of the rationality of legislators as career-driven individuals? These are the main questions that drive this thesis. To answer these questions, I develop a prospect theory-based framework that accounts for how electoral security and political ambition impact legislatorsâ behaviour in influencing the strength of <b>gender</b> <b>quota</b> designs. I argue that, faced with growing pressures to adopt <b>gender</b> <b>quotas,</b> male parliamentarians engage in the risk-taking process of assenting with <b>gender</b> <b>quotas,</b> meanwhile seeking to minimize the potential costs of the policy to their future careers by actively weakening quota designs. To evaluate the plausibility of my theory, I employ a series of multi-method and multi-level analyses presented across five substantive chapters, {{each of which is}} respectively based on: 1) a cross-sectional analysis of Latin America countries; 2) an elite survey experiment with Brazilian state legislators; and, in-depth process tracing of the cases of <b>gender</b> <b>quota</b> adoption in 3) Costa Rica; 4) Brazil; and, 5) Chile. The work makes three main contributions. Firstly, although previously identified, the resistance of male legislators towards <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> had never been systematically analysed in a comparative manner; focusing on the behaviour of male incumbents is thus a relevant contribution. Secondly, although various authors have provided explanations for the origins of <b>gender</b> <b>quota</b> adoptions, no work had ever comparatively assessed sources of the variation in <b>gender</b> <b>quota</b> designs. Thus, I move the study of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> beyond the binary choice of adoption. Thirdly, I show that the static assumptions of endogenous institutionalism need to be modified by the introduction of risk, which can only be achieved by integrating the insights of prospect theory. </p...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} prominence which debates about <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> enjoy within public life, {{it is imperative}} that we understand how, if at all, they achieve the ends to which they are directed. It is in this context that The Impact of <b>Gender</b> <b>Quotas</b> stands as an important contribution to a pressing political debate. Linnea Sandström Lange finds the book to be full of empirical insights into the efficacy of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas,</b> arguing that the rather pessimistic immediate picture painted by the studies detailed in the book should be counterbalanced by acknowledging the as yet unclear long-term effects of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas...</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the dilemmas, contradictions and paradoxes in the Danish approach to <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> and <b>gender</b> equality and discusses the intersections of citizenship, democracy and gender justice. Gender research understands <b>gender</b> <b>quota</b> {{as a means}} to achieve equal rights, gender equality and gender parity. Gender theory has conceptualized gender parity as one step towards achieving gender justice in all arenas of social, political and economic life. The Danish cases illustrate that context matters and question <b>gender</b> <b>quota</b> as a universal strategy to achieve gender equality. The empirical focus of the paper is placed on three arenas: 1) <b>gender</b> <b>quota</b> in political governance; 2) <b>gender</b> <b>quota</b> in parental leave policies; and 3) <b>gender</b> <b>quota</b> in economic governance. The paper is primarily concerned with analyses of Danish discourses and policies in relation to the three policy areas and only to a limited extent {{addresses the}} impact of these policies and their implications for lived practice. One issue concerns the paradox of the relatively high female representation in politics without the adoption of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas.</b> A second issue concerns the gap between gender equality policies. Denmark lacks behind the other Scandinavian countries’ discourses and policies about <b>gender</b> <b>quota</b> but in practice the picture is much more complex. A third issue concerns the European perspective. In relation to women’s labour market participation and gender parity in politics Denmark is ahead of other European countries but lacks behind in relation to equal representation on corporate boards...|$|R
