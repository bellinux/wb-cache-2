40|$|The {{quality of}} the EC-inventory depends {{strongly}} on the {{quality of the}} national GHG inventories (comparability of the methodologies, definitions etc.). For the agricultural sector, workshops to improve the quality of GHG were organized in February 2003 and in October 2004. Due to the large uncertainty that emissions from agricultural soils add to the total inventories, the latter workshop focused on issues relevant for category 4 D. A number of recommendations for improving the <b>EC</b> <b>inventory</b> regarding coherent and comprehensive reporting of emissions (including air pollutants), data gaps, and addressing the availability of national and disaggregated emission factors and other relevant parameters were formulated and will be presented in detail and analyzed on the basis of the most recent GHG inventories for the year 2003.

40|$|International audienceAn {{extended}} {{array of}} carbonaceous species including elemental carbon (EC), water insoluble organic carbon (WinOC) {{as well as}} dissolved organic carbon (DOC), humic-like substances (HULIS), and single organic compounds like carboxylic acids, levoglucosan, and cellulose was investigated {{for the first time}} in Alpine snow deposits. These investigations were done on selected discrete ice cores sections extracted from Mount Rosa and Mount Blanc glaciers covering the 20 th century and extending back to previous centuries. Here we focus on major changes in summer ice layers. Among carbonaceous components, EC reveals an outstanding increase with a sharp summer increase after World War II. This result is discussed against available past <b>EC</b> emission <b>inventories</b> in Europe which are thought to be mainly driven by emissions from road transport and residential sector. The long-term trend of organic carbon (OC) aerosol preserved in ice, WinOC as well as water soluble organic carbon (WSOC), was successfully reconstructed using the suitable array of organic compounds we investigated in this study. It is shown that the level of OC preserved in ice has increased by a factor of 2 after 1950 likely as a result of the enhancement of the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere over the last decades producing more secondary organic atmospheric aerosol from biogenic gaseous precursors...|$|R
40|$|This {{study shows}} the {{capabilities}} of a benchmarking system to identify inconsistencies in emission inventories, and to evaluate the reason behind discrepancies {{as a mean to}} improve both bottom-up and downscaled emission inventories. Fine scale bottom-up emission inventories for seven urban areas in Norway are compared with three regional emission <b>inventories,</b> <b>EC</b> 4 MACS, TNO_MACC-II and TNO_MACC-III, downscaled to the same areas. The comparison shows discrepancies in nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM 2. 5 and PM 10) when evaluating both total and sectorial emissions. The three regional emission inventories underestimate NOx and PM 10 traffic emissions by approximately 20 e 80 % and 50 e 90 %, respectively. The main reasons for the underestimation of PM 10 emissions from traffic in the regional inventories are related to non-exhaust emissions due to resuspension, which are included in the bottom-up emission inventories but are missing in the official national emissions, and therefore in the downscaled regional inventories. The benchmarking indicates that the most probable reason behind the underestimation of NOx traffic emissions by the regional inventories is the activity data. The fine scale NOx traffic emissions from bottom-up inventories are based on the actual traffic volume at the road link and are much higher than the NOx emissions downscaled from national estimates based on fuel sales and based on population for the urban areas. We have identified important discrepancies in PM 2. 5 emissions from wood burning for residential heating among all the inventories. These discrepancies are associated with the assumptions made for the allocation of emissions. In the <b>EC</b> 4 MACs <b>inventory,</b> such assumptions imply high underestimation of PM 2. 5 emissions from the residential combustion sector in urban areas, which ranges from 40 to 90 % compared with the bottom-up inventories. The study shows that in three of the seven Norwegian cities there is need for further improvement of the emission inventories. JRC. C. 5 -Air and Climat...|$|R
30|$|These {{previous}} studies have contributed considerably {{to the understanding of}} forest C dynamics; however, at sites with more complex vegetation structure and topography, such as the forests found in coastal British Columbia, the spatial distribution of vegetation structure and the footprint distribution are important considerations for accurate comparisons of <b>EC</b> flux-tower and <b>inventory</b> plot measurements (Schmid and Lloyd 1999). More complex ecosystems, therefore, require more complex models and methods developed for accurate comparisons of EC flux-tower measurements and inventory-based measurements. For example, a limited number of studies, including Ehman et al. (2002), Chen et al. (2009), Ferster et al. (2011), and Gielen et al. (2013) applied weighting by EC flux-tower footprint climatology to inventory-based measurements, where areas of the footprint that contribute more to tower-measured flux are weighted more heavily than other areas, resulting in an overall improvement when compared to simple flux footprint geometries.|$|R
30|$|Comparing EC flux-tower {{cumulative}} NEP (ΣNEP) {{and inventory}} ground plot measurements of C stock changes (ΔC) {{over the same}} period can help inform forest C processes for several reasons. First, ground plot measurements can serve as an independent validation of ΣNEP measurements made at <b>EC</b> flux-towers. Second, <b>inventory</b> plot data can provide more detailed information about the stand structural changes that may be driving variation stand-level EC C exchange. Third, broad stand inventory measurement datasets are available for a greater spatial extent than the global EC flux-tower network. For example, the Canadian National Forest Inventory (NFI) samples approximately 22, 000 photo plots locations across Canada with detailed ground plots measured at over 1000 locations (Gillis et al. 2005). However, comparing inventory plot changes and EC flux-tower measurements requires comparisons to be made across different spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, such comparisons pose methodological challenges beyond individual <b>inventory</b> plot and <b>EC</b> flux-tower measurements.|$|R
40|$|Elemental Carbon (EC) has a {{significant}} impact on human health and climate change. In order to evaluate the size segregation of EC emission in the EUCAARI inventory and investigate its influence on the simulation of EC long-range transportation in Europe, we used the fully coupled online Weather Research and Forecasting/Chemistry model (WRF-Chem) at a resolution of 2 km focusing on a region in Germany, in conjunction with a high-resolution <b>EC</b> emission <b>inventory.</b> The ground meteorology conditions, vertical structure and wind pattern were well reproduced by the model. The simulations of particle number and/or mass size distributions were evaluated with observations at the central European background site Melpitz. The fine mode particle concentration was reasonably well simulated, but the coarse mode was substantially overestimated by the model mainly due to the plume with high EC concentration in coarse mode emitted by a nearby point source. The comparisons between simulated EC and Multi-angle Absorption Photometers (MAAP) measurements at Melpitz, Leipzig-TROPOS and Bösel indicated that the coarse mode EC (ECc) emitted from the nearby point sources might be overestimated by a factor of 2 - 10. The fraction of ECc was overestimated in the emission inventory by about 10 - 30 % for Russia and 5 - 10 % for Eastern Europe (e. g., Poland and Belarus). This incorrect size-dependent EC emission results in a shorter atmospheric life time of EC particles and inhibits the long-range transport of EC. A case study showed that this effect caused an underestimation of 20 - 40 % in the EC mass concentration in Germany under eastern wind pattern. © 2016 Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{regional}} EMEP {{model has}} been applied to calculate EC concentrations over Europe for the years 2002 - 2004 using a new <b>EC</b> emission <b>inventory.</b> The results are compared with measurements from the CARBOSOL and EMEP EC/ OC campaigns. The model underestimates EC concentrations by 19 % on average, and the spatial correlation is 0. 80. For individual sites, the model bias varies from - 79 to 77 % and the average temporal correlation is 0. 53, varying from 0. 25 to 0. 79. The model flattens the north-south EC gradient as it tends to overestimate EC for Nordic sites and underestimate EC for more southern sites. We have also studied the contributions of various processes to the model EC results. Using EC as a tracer of primary PM emissions from combustion sources we have made a preliminary evaluation of the anthropogenic EC (PM) emission. There are indications of a possible underestimation of EC emissions from traffic in some areas and both underestimation and overestimation of EC emissions from residential combustion for some European countries. The largest uncertainties probably lie in EC emissions from residential wood/ fossil combustion and are associated with both emission factors and spatial and temporal variation. The need to develop accurate and time resolved wildfire emissions is emphasized. The effect of EC aging is shown be rather limited for most of Europe (1 to 4 %). Changes in EC wet scavenging ratio have a noticeable effect on calculated EC (between 5 and 25 % for most Europe and 30 - 40 % in remote areas), but EC scavenging ratios are still poorly known...|$|R
30|$|This {{research}} highlights {{how different}} measurements and approaches for C accounting include different constraints, {{and as a}} result, computations using different data sources may not converge. Each type of measurement has “different strengths and weaknesses, but the combination of multiple measurements and modeling {{has the potential for}} refining estimates of C stocks and fluxes” (Law et al. 2004). For example, eddy-covariance data are temporally detailed, and provide information about daily and seasonal processes. However, the data are less spatially extensive and detailed than the forest inventory data, for example, only three sites were available in this study each covering an area with diverse vegetation within the tower footprint. Measurement error was estimated to be relatively low, on the order of 0.9 Mg C ha− 1 year − 1 (Morgenstern et al. 2004). In contrast, forest inventory data are more spatially extensive and include detailed measurements of forest attributes. The main constraint for forest inventory data is that they are less temporally detailed (for example, measurements were available at only two points in time), and the error in these measurements may be greater than the expected rate of change over the measurement interval. The inventory plots in this study sampled a broad range of vegetation conditions and provided insight into the representativeness of flux-tower footprints. Estimates of error of 1.2 to 1.3 Mg C ha− 1 were identified relating to spatial representativeness of the inventory plots within the tower footprints. Finally, C budget models are important for understanding landscape scale C processes. Since these models depend on numerous coefficients, algorithms and assumptions, it is valuable to compare model outputs with <b>EC</b> flux and <b>inventory</b> measurements to assess their performance and evaluate their behaviour. Considering all of these approaches together, the relative strengths and limitation of each approach can be taken into account in evaluating the suitability of each type of measurement at varying spatial and temporal scales.|$|R
