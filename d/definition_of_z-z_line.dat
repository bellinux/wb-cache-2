40|$|The {{process of}} vector boson {{scattering}} {{is of great}} interest because it is completely prescribed in the Standard Model (SM) once the Higgs mass is known. The LHC is a source <b>of</b> <b>Z-Z</b> pairs produced {{by means of the}} vector boson fusion mechanism which is inferred by the presence of two additional forward (or tag) jets. Because the reaction can be initiated by valence quarks and because the W+W->Z+Z cross section approaches a constant in the SM, the scattering process is accessible at the LHC...|$|R
40|$|The human T-lymphocytes {{receptor}} complex {{consists of}} the antigenic peptide binding subunit, the heterodimer a-b and the transducing subunit CD 3, the latter resulting from the assembly of three dimers: g-d, g-e and z-z. The present work analyses the human z-z homodimer structure in lipid bilayers by Molecular dynamic simulations. We used the palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) that resembles the cell membrane in lipid composition, and the POPC/cholesterol/palmitoyl-sphyngomyelin (1 : 1 : 1) that resembles the raft membrane microdomains, {{thought to be the}} sites of the signal transducing machinery. Molecular simulations <b>of</b> the <b>z-z</b> structure determined by Call (Cell, 2006) in water, showed the formation of a stable homodimer; the presence of cholesterol and sphyngomyelin produced significant alterations of the structure; water molecules {{played a crucial role in}} the arrangement of an interchain hydrogen bonding network; the model in raft showed an a-helix structure more extended (for each chain: 6. 3 - 17. 0 Å in POPC and 12. 3 - 27. 4 Å in raft), and a more compact packing (the distance between the centers of mass of the two helices was 7. 9 Å in raft and 9. 7 Å in POPC). Our results suggest a specific conformation <b>of</b> <b>z-z</b> in the raft environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper {{is part of a larger}} project on the semi-automatic generation <b>of</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> semantically-related terms in specialized resources. The work reported here involves the formulation of instructions to generate the <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> sets of morphologically-related predicative terms, based on the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> one of the members of the set. In many cases, it is assumed that the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> a predicative term can be inferred by combining the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> a related lexical unit with the information provided by the semantic relation (i. e. lexical function) that links them. In other words, terminographers only need to know the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> pollute and the semantic relation that links it to other morphologically-related terms (polluter, polluting, pollutant, etc.) in order to create the <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> the set. The results show that rules can be used to generate a preliminary set <b>of</b> <b>definitions</b> (based on specific lexical functions). They also show that more complex rules would need to be devised for other morphological pairs...|$|R
