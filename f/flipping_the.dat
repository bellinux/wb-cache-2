5|$|The set of all {{solutions}} to a 2-satisfiability instance has {{the structure of}} a median graph, in which an edge corresponds to the operation of <b>flipping</b> <b>the</b> values of a set of variables that are all constrained to be equal or unequal to each other. In particular, by following edges in this way one can get from any solution to any other solution. Conversely, any median graph can be represented as the set of {{solutions to}} a 2-satisfiability instance in this way. The median of any three solutions is formed by setting each variable to the value it holds in the majority of the three solutions. This median always forms another solution to the instance.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, Paul filed {{to run for}} {{re-election}} to his Senate seat in 2016. Had he become the Republican presidential (or vice-presidential) nominee, state law would prohibit him from simultaneously running {{for re-election}}. In March 2014, the Republican-controlled Kentucky Senate passed {{a bill that would}} allow Paul to run for both offices, but the Democratic-controlled Kentucky House of Representatives declined to take it up. Paul spent his own campaign money in the 2014 legislative elections, helping Republican candidates for the State House in the hopes of <b>flipping</b> <b>the</b> chamber, thus allowing the legislature to pass the bill (Democratic Governor Steve Beshear's veto can be overridden with a simple majority). However, the Democrats retained their 54–46 majority in the State House. Paul has since given his support to the idea that the Kentucky Republican Party could decide to hold a caucus rather than a primary, potentially giving Paul more time to decide whether he should run for U.S. Senator or continue a potential bid for President.|$|E

25|$|A DST-III or DST-IV can be {{computed}} from a DCT-III or DCT-IV (see discrete cosine transform), respectively, by reversing {{the order of}} the inputs and <b>flipping</b> <b>the</b> sign of every other output, and vice versa for DST-II from DCT-II. In this way it follows that types II–IV of the DST require exactly the same number of arithmetic operations (additions and multiplications) as the corresponding DCT types.|$|E

25|$|A {{variation}} on the ring gag, the spider gag has hooks on the sides so as to keep the wearer from <b>flipping</b> <b>the</b> ring horizontally in their mouth.

25|$|Many {{algorithms}} {{are designed}} to transform {{only a small part}} of the cube without interfering with other parts that have already been solved, so that they can be applied repeatedly to different parts of the cube until the whole is solved.

25|$|The {{researchers}} found {{the results of}} this study to match their initial hypothesis that the gambler's fallacy could in fact be countered by the use of the hot hand and people's attention to the person who was actively <b>flipping</b> <b>the</b> coin. It is important to note that this counteraction of the gambler's fallacy only happened if the person tossing the coin remained the same. This study shed light on the idea that the gambler's and hot hand fallacies at times fight for dominance when people try to make predictions about the same event.|$|E

Second was a coin focus, where the person who tossed the coin mentioned that the coin was {{coming up with a}} lot of heads or tails. Finally there was a control condition in which there was nothing said by the person tossing the coin. The participants were also assigned to different groups, one in which the person <b>flipping</b> <b>the</b> coin changed and the other where the person remained the same.|$|E
25|$|The {{pivoting}} {{part that}} supports the cylinder is called the crane; it is the weak point of swing-out cylinder designs. Using the method often portrayed in movies and television of <b>flipping</b> <b>the</b> cylinder open and closed {{with a flick of}} the wrist can in fact cause the crane to bend over time, throwing the cylinder out of alignment with the barrel. Lack of alignment between chamber and barrel is a dangerous condition, as it can impede the bullet's transition from chamber to barrel. This gives rise to higher pressures in the chamber, bullet damage, and the potential for an explosion if the bullet becomes stuck.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} {{engages in}} the behavior to escape aversive tasks or demands. For example, {{when a child is}} told to take a bath he begins to cry, and his mother tells him he no longer has to take a bath. Another example includes a teacher telling a student to complete a series of math problems, to which the student flips the desk and is sent to the principal's office. Being sent to the principals office reinforced the behavior of <b>flipping</b> <b>the</b> desk because it allowed the child to escape the aversive activity of completing math problems. Common forms of aversive demands/activities include, but are not limited to, difficult tasks, changes in routines, unpredictability, novel tasks, etc.|$|E

25|$|Compact Cassettes contain two {{miniature}} spools, between {{which the}} magnetically coated, polyester-type plastic film (magnetic tape) is passed and wound. These spools and their attendant parts are held inside a protective plastic shell. Two stereo pairs of tracks (four total) or two monaural audio tracks {{are available on}} the tape; one stereo pair or one monophonic track is played or recorded when the tape is moving in one direction and the second (pair) when moving in the other direction. This reversal is achieved either by manually <b>flipping</b> <b>the</b> cassette, or by the machine automatically changing the direction of tape movement ("auto-reverse") when it detects that the tape has come to an end.|$|E
25|$|In shogi, {{all but two}} of {{the eight}} piece types can promote, but only to a {{particular}} piece (indicated by <b>flipping</b> <b>the</b> piece to show the character on its reverse); two of these pieces are available only by promotion. Promotion may occur when a piece makes a move wholly or partially within the three furthest ranks of the board, but whether or not to promote the piece is at the discretion of the player (unless it is a forward-moving piece that has advanced too far forward {{to be able to move}} again, in which case promotion is mandatory). When a promoted piece is captured and dropped, it returns to its unpromoted state.|$|E
25|$|A {{closely related}} {{property}} is chirality, {{which in turn}} is closely related to a more easily visualized property called helicity. The helicity of a particle is the direction of its spin relative to its momentum; particles with spin {{in the same direction as}} their momentum are called right-handed and otherwise they are called left-handed. When a particle is massless, the direction of its momentum relative to its spin is frame independent, while for massive particles it is possible to 'overtake' the particle by a Lorentz transformation <b>flipping</b> <b>the</b> helicity. Chirality is a technical property (defined through the transformation behaviour under the Poincaré group) that agrees with helicity for (approximately) massless particles and is still well defined for massive particles.|$|E

The runs are scored by <b>flipping</b> <b>the</b> book open at random and the last digit of the right-side (even-numbered) page is counted {{as the number of}} runs scored. 0 (and sometimes 8) are assigned to special rules, typically a wicket is lost when a person scores 0 and scoring 8 would be substituted for a No ball run and an additional chance. To give an example, if the batting side opened the book at page 26, then 6 runs would be scored. For the toss, what is generally done is that both the players open a page and the one whose last digit is greater wins.|$|E
