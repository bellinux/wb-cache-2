5|$|Due to the damage, {{the name}} Ione was retired {{and will never}} be used for an Atlantic {{hurricane}} again. This was before the formal lists were created, as a result it was not replaced with any particular name. As a result of this, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> the name Ione {{was used for the}} Atlantic Basin since hurricane naming began in 1950.|$|E
5|$|The 37th Boat Race, {{an annual}} {{side-by-side}} rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames, {{took place on}} 22 March 1880 following a postponement two days earlier {{as a result of}} thick fog. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> {{in the history of the}} event that the race has been rescheduled. Oxford won by a margin of three-and-three-quarter lengths in a time of 21 minutes 23 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Australia's strongest ever {{performance}} in swimming {{was at the}} 1956 Olympics on home soil in Melbourne. Australia claimed eight of the thirteen gold medals available, including both relays and a clean sweep of the medals in the 100m freestyle, considered the blue-riband event {{for both men and}} women. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> that Australia has topped the medal tally in swimming, and the tally of gold medals has not been surpassed despite the expansion of the swimming program to its current 32 events.|$|E

5|$|In 1909 the {{newspaper}} La Gazzetta dello Sport established the Giro d'Italia, {{inspired by the}} success of the Tour de France, which started in 1903. The first Giro was won by Luigi Ganna, while Carlo Galetti won the two following Giros. In 1912, there was no individual classification, instead there was only a team classification, which was won by Team Atala. The 1912 Giro <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> the competition has not had an individual classification. From 1914 onwards the scoring format was changed from a points-based system to a time-based system, in which the cyclist who had the lowest aggregate time {{at the end of the}} race would win. The Giro was suspended for four years from 1915 to 1918, due to the First World War. Costante Girardengo was the winner of the first Giro after the war in 1919.|$|E
5|$|The Bharat Ratna, {{along with}} other {{personal}} civil honours, was briefly suspended from July 1977 to January 1980, during {{the change in the}} national government; and for a second time from August 1992 to December 1995, when several public-interest litigations challenged the constitutional validity of the awards. In 1992, the government's decision to confer the award posthumously on Subhash Chandra Bose was opposed by those who had refused to accept the fact of his death, including some members of his extended family. Following a 1997 Supreme Court decision, the press communiqué announcing Bose's award was cancelled; it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> when the award was announced but not conferred.|$|E
5|$|The Lady Vols {{were awarded}} the No. 1 {{seed in the}} Mideast Regional where their {{opponent}} was, oddly enough, also undefeated. The 28–0 Lady Flames of Liberty were the champions of the Big South conference, giving them a berth in the tournament as a No. 16 seed. The usual #1-#16 blowout occurred, with Tennessee winning 102–58, although in another region this blowout did not occur: No. 16 seed Harvard upset injury-depleted No. 1 seed Stanford 71–67 in the West regional. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> that a 16-seed has beaten a 1-seed in the NCAA tournament— men's or women's.|$|E

5|$|The United States, {{the winner}} of all {{previous}} editions of this event, was boycotting the games {{in response to the}} Soviet war in Afghanistan. As a result, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and Sweden were expected to win. Australia's Quietly Confident Quartet, however, composed of backstroker Mark Kerry, breaststroker Peter Evans, butterflyer Mark Tonelli, and freestyler Neil Brooks, surprisingly won the final in 3:45.70. They were followed by the silver medalists Soviet Union, 0.22 seconds in arrears, and the bronze medalists Great Britain, as favorites Sweden had been disqualified in the heats. To date, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> the United States has not won the gold medal in the event.|$|E
5|$|This season had 16 {{tropical}} depressions, 15 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes, i.e. {{those that}} rank as Category3 or {{higher on the}} Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The most noteworthy storms for the season were the five named storms that made landfall in the U.S. states of Florida and Alabama, three of them with at least 115mph (185km/h) sustained winds (major hurricane strength): Tropical Storm Bonnie, Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> in recorded history that four hurricanes affected the U.S. State of Florida although one of the four, Ivan, brought hurricane force winds to the state without making a landfall there.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they all}} share the forest, {{relationships}} between different Clans are tense. They often come {{into conflict with}} one another, becoming aggressive if a cat from a neighboring Clan accidentally crosses a border. This rivalry can increase in times of deprivation, such as if one Clan is suffering from a shortage of prey but another is thriving. An attempt for one Clan to steal all of or part of another Clan's territory is not unusual. To prepare for this, cats in all Clans are taught battle moves {{in order to protect}} their territory. Each Clan has signature battle moves that are taught to them from an early age (6 months/moons old). Border fights are the most common source of battle (a cat intentionally or unwittingly steps into another Clan's territory), and are often short-lived and cause no real damage to either side. However, bigger and more brutal battles can occur; at this point, casualties are to be expected. Despite this rivalry, the Clans can also show concern for another's well being; the idea of one Clan being destroyed causes deep distress, and will prompt urgent action on behalf of all four Clans. On the night of every full moon, the Clans will meet at a designated spot in order to share stories and news in peace. This is known as a 'Gathering', and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> in which fighting is prohibited.|$|E

5|$|Bonnet further {{tried to}} {{disguise}} {{his return to}} piracy by engaging in a pretence of trade with the next two vessels he robbed. Soon afterward, Bonnet quit the charade of trading and reverted to naked piracy. In July 1718, he cruised north to Delaware Bay, pillaging another eleven vessels. He took several prisoners, some of whom joined his pirate crew. While Bonnet set loose most of his prizes after looting them, he retained control {{of the last two}} ships he captured: the sloops Francis and Fortune. On 1August 1718, the Royal James and the two captured sloops sailed southward from Delaware Bay. The captured sloops lagged behind, and Bonnet threatened to sink them if they did not stay closer. During the passage, Bonnet and his crew divided their loot into shares of about £10 or £11 and distributed them amongst themselves. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> Bonnet is known to have practised this important pirate custom, and it suggests he had by then abandoned his unorthodox practice of paying regular wages to his crew.|$|E
5|$|Of the 314 {{personnel}} aboard Voyager at {{the time}} of the collision, 14 officers, 67 sailors, and 1 civilian dockyard worker were killed, including Stevens and all but two of the bridge team. A Royal Commission into the events of the collision was held in 1964, and found that while Voyager was primarily at fault for neglecting to maintain an effective lookout and awareness of the larger ship's location, Melbournes bridge crew was also at fault, for failing to alert Voyager and not taking measures to avoid the collision. Robertson was posted to the training base —a move that he and the Australian media saw as tantamount to a demotion—but resigned instead. The Royal Commission and its aftermath were poorly handled, and following pressure from the public, media, and politicians, combined with revelations by Voyagers former executive officer that Stevens may have been unfit for command, a second Royal Commission was opened in 1967. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> in Australian history two Royal Commissions have been held for a single incident. The second commission found that Stevens was medically unfit for command and that some of the findings of the first Royal Commission were therefore based on incorrect assumptions. Robertson and the other officers of Melbourne were absolved of blame for the incident.|$|E
5|$|Once Stockport {{returned}} to Division 2, they struggled and survived an automatic relegation by one point. The 1923–24 season saw Stockport County finish 13th, one place above Manchester United. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> in history Stockport has achieved better than Manchester United. During this campaign Stockport goalkeeper Harry Hardy was {{called up to}} play for the England national team and kept a clean sheet in a 4–0 win against Belgium. He is the only player to be capped at full level by England while on Stockport's books. Two seasons later (1925–26) Stockport {{returned to}} the bottom division after finishing bottom of the league and only picking up 25 points. Stockport finished 6th the next season (1926–27) but suffered a 2-point deduction and £100 fine for fielding an ineligible player after the registration documents for Joe Smith were not received by the Football League.|$|E

5|$|Originally the 1995 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships {{was planned}} to take place at Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre in Hamar, the same venue which hosted short track speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics. However, because Storhamar was at {{scheduled}} time playing play-offs in the Norwegian Ice Hockey Championship, it was in December 1994 decided to move the tournament to Gjøvik. The championship opened on Friday 17 March with the 1500 meter races, and {{was followed by the}} 500 meter races the following day. The remaining events were held on 19 March. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> the world championship has been held in Norway. There were set six world records during the championship. Chae Ji-Hoon's time 4:56.29 in the men's 3000 meter and Chun Lee-Kyung at 5:02.18 in the women's 3000 meter. Kim Yun-Mi set the record on the women's 500 meter at 45.33 in an introductory race, while Frederic Blackburn set a world record at 2:19.71 in the semi-final of the 1500 meter. Both the relay teams also set world records: Canada with the men's record at 7:09.76 and the China with the women's at 4:26.68. The hall was one of seven venues used during the group state of the 1999 World Women's Handball Championship. Lillehammer is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics and Gjøvik is set to host short track speed skating.|$|E
