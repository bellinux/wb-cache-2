40|$|Original title: Vrijwilligerswerk in meervoud. By {{international}} standards, {{the level}} of participation in <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> in the Netherlands is high, and the signs are that this will continue. On the other hand, the type of <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> and the groups {{in which it is}} concentrated are changing. Is there a trend towards looser, more individual arrangements? Do rising education levels and postmaterialist values compensate for the fact that people are increasingly turning their backs on the Church? Do newcomers to Dutch society do less <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> than the indigenous population, and will they make up the gap? How does <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> fit in with today's busy lives?

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{participation in}} formal <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> in Iceland. Findings from three {{waves of the}} European Values Study (EVS) from 1990 - 2010 are discussed in a theoretical and international context. The results show that around {{a third of the}} Icelandic population aged 18 years and older was involved in some kind of unpaid <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> in 2009 - 2010, a little fewer than in 1990. Around 75 % were members of voluntary organizations, about the same ratio as in 1990. Respondents were most likely to do <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> for sports- or recreation associations and {{were also more likely to}} belong to sports clubs than other associations or organizations. Although <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> for social welfare services was the second most frequent, that type of associations suffered the biggest decline in the number of volunteers between 1990 and 2009. Overall, there is not a significant difference in men and women‘s participation in voluntary organizations although men are much more likely than women to do unpaid <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> for associations involved in sports, recreation and youth work. Respondents over 50 years are more likely to do <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> than younger participants, especially in the field of social welfare. Respondents with higher education are the most likely to be involved in <b>voluntary</b> <b>work.</b> Occupational status is also strongly linked to such work, mainly within sports and recreation. Married respondents are in all instances more likely than others to do <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> and people in rural areas are more likely than people in urban areas to engage in such activities. The results that are in accordance with international findings provide important information about participation in voluntary organizations, unpaid <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> in Iceland, and changes over time...|$|R
40|$|To {{contribute}} to the debate as to whether volunteering is an outcome of democratization rather than a driver of it, we analyze how divergent democratization pathways in six countries of the former Soviet Union have led to varied levels of <b>voluntary</b> <b>work.</b> Using data from the European Values Study, we find that Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia - which followed a Europeanization path - have high and increasing levels of civil liberties and <b>voluntary</b> <b>work.</b> In Russia and Belarus, following a pre-emption path, civil liberties have remained low and <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> has declined. Surprisingly, despite the Orange Revolution and increased civil liberties, <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> rates in Ukraine have also declined. The case of Ukraine indicates that the freedom to participate is not always taken up by citizens. Our findings suggest it is not <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> that brings civil liberties, but rather that increased civil liberties lead {{to higher levels of}} volunteering...|$|R

40|$|SYNOPSIS The thesis has {{a form of}} a {{theoretical}} study with significant relation to practice in professional volunteer supervision in Kladno Volunteer Center. The thesis is divided in 7 parts. Part One {{is focused on the}} definition of basic terms such as volunteer, <b>voluntary</b> <b>work.</b> This part deals with the issue of awarding of volunteers. Part Two is devoted to the basic terminology of social pedagogy, including the definition of free time, the phenomenon, which is very important for both <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> and social pedagogy. Part Three is centered at history of social pedagogy and <b>voluntary</b> <b>work.</b> Key intersections of the two studied phenomena and their evolution are described. Part Four describes voluntary activities as a social phenomenon. Subparts are focused on the attitude of society towards <b>voluntary</b> <b>work,</b> the myths associated with it, as well as the volunteer work motivation. In part Five, I was trying to grasp volunteering as a tool of social pedagogy. The subparts combine my findings acquired from books and my own practical experience. Part Six is an analysis of a specific case of "Pět P" programme practice. Part Seven - the final one - includes a small scale empirical research.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the motives and incitements for <b>voluntary</b> <b>work.</b> The main {{question}} for this thesis is why people get involved in <b>voluntary</b> <b>work.</b> What are the motives and incitements for voluntary commitment and what do people gain from this kind of commitment? The thesis is based upon qualitative research methods at Frivilligcentralen in Norrköping. The theoretical perspectives are a community commitment, satisfaction {{of being part of}} a meaningful context, altruistic and self-interest and an increased pace of social changes. The results show that social conditions, community insufficiency, community commitment and personal motives and incitements all prove to be the reason for <b>voluntary</b> <b>work.</b> An important conclusion of this thesis shows that {{there are a variety of}} complex motives to why people involve themselves in this kind of <b>voluntary</b> <b>work...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> has been exceedingly appreciated {{in the last}} few decades. This is not surprising at all, because it is highly profitable according to the related estimated data. There are 115, 9 million people doing <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> only in Europe, which means that they would create the world's 7 th biggest economy with EUR 282 billion value creation if they formed an individual state. The organizations know that <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> has several advantages apart from the economic benefits. It is profitable both for the society and for the individuals as well. Several researches have proven that <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> positively influences the development of the personality, because the key-competencies - such as: co-operation, empathy, solidarity, conflict handling, problem solving, etc. - expected in the labor market can be improved...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} the diploma paper is <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> {{and its impact on}} the {{development}} of professional identity of social pedagogues. The theoretical part provides a definition, characteristics, volunteers and effects with the aim of presenting <b>voluntary</b> <b>work.</b> The second chapter presents social pedagogy, the competences of social pedagogues and development of professional identity. The empirical part gives qualitative analysis of two interviews with social pedagogues in order to establish how much experience with <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> affects the study of social pedagogy, professional work of social pedagogues and, last but not least, developing their professional identities. The results are presented in two schemes, which include six main parts: <b>voluntary</b> <b>work,</b> the study of social pedagogy, link between voluntary and professional social-pedagogical <b>work,</b> differences between <b>voluntary</b> and professional social-pedagogical work, professional social-pedagogical work and professional identity. The research has showed that <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> affects the study of social pedagogy and professional work of social pedagogues as well as development of their professional identities. The extent of the influence depends on several factors. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{responds}} to Dominelli's contribution by mapping three lines of discussion. The first {{relates to the}} issue of how to understand <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> with regard to the realization of citizenship. The authors argue that this understanding depends on the way citizenship is conceived. Whereas a rights-based conception of citizenship focuses on issues of equal access to <b>voluntary</b> <b>work,</b> a duty-oriented notion of citizenship tends to see voluntarism as embedded in an educational strategy, alongside professionalized social work. The authors plead for an alternative understanding of <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> and social work as joined partners in practices of 'learning democracy'. The second line of discussion revolves around the relation between social and political dimensions of citizenship. With Dominelli, the authors point out how the obscuring of the political dimension risks to nurture societal discourses that put pressure on the welfare state. The third point relates to the difficulties in positioning <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> with regard to professional social work. One of these difficulties is the tendency to over-romanticize <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> as warm, informal, generous, while giving an exclusively technical reading of social work professionalization...|$|R
