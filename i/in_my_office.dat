In 1771, he moved Abigail and the children to Braintree, but he kept his office in Boston, saying, [...] "I shall spend more Time <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>Office</b> than ever I did." [...] He also noted {{on the day of}} the family's move, [...] "Now my family is away, I feel no Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but at my Office. I am in it by 6 in the Morning – I am in it at 9 at night.... In the Evening, I can be alone at my Office, and no where else. I never could in my family." [...] Nevertheless, after some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and [...] "vulgar" [...] Braintree as a home for his family. In August 1772, therefore, Adams moved his family back to Boston. He purchased a large brick house on Queen Street, not far from his office. In 1774, Adams and Abigail returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home.|$|E

He said, [...] "Bring me one woman who has been left behind. Bring me one. There's not one." [...] Numerous media outlets have refuted this assertion.

Zeng Guofan once chided him, [...] "Shaoquan, now that you're working <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>office,</b> I only have this piece of advice for you: 'Commitment' is the only thing that matters to us here." [...] Li was shocked and he improved his behaviour after that. In the same year, Weng Tongshu (翁同書), the xunfu of Anhui, abandoned his post when he came under attack by the Taiping rebels. Zeng Guofan drew from Li's draft when he wrote a memorial to the imperial court to accuse Weng Tongshu of failing in his duty. The lines from Li's draft that were included in Zeng Guofan's actual memorial included: [...] "It is my duty, as Your Majesty's subject, [...] I do not dare to let this pass just because of Weng Tonghe's fame and prestige." [...] Although Li earned Zeng Guofan's praise for drafting the memorial, he also caused Weng Tonghe (Weng Tongshu's brother) to bear a grudge against him for what he wrote. While serving under Zeng Guofan, he was put in charge of Yanjianshao Circuit (延建邵道) in Fujian Province but did not take up his appointment and remained with Zeng.|$|E
2500|$|Scorpion yells {{one of two}} taunts at {{his opponents}} when he hits them with his spear. They were voiced by Boon in the games (up until Mortal Kombat X) and both feature films, but {{only one of them}} ("Come here!") was {{included}} in the home ports of MK and MKII due to memory constraints. According to Boon, the second of the character's phrases originated because he thought [...] "it would be funny to have him yell out 'Get over here!' when he ," [...] and he was thus encouraged to get behind the studio microphone and record the taunts. Twenty years after the first MK game's release, Boon included creating the spear move as well as the character itself among his personal high points of the franchise's history, adding: [...] "I remember people sitting <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>office</b> all day just doing this uppercut [...] again and again, like 'Oh my God, that feels so good.'
