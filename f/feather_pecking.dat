Benefits of battery cages include easier care for the birds, floor eggs which are expensive to collect are eliminated, eggs are cleaner, capture at the end of lay is expedited, generally less feed is required to produce eggs, broodiness is eliminated, more hens may be housed in a given house floor space, internal parasites are more easily treated, and labor requirements are generally much reduced.|$|E
2500|$|In close confinement, cannibalism, <b>feather</b> <b>pecking</b> and {{aggression}} are common among turkeys, ducks, pheasants, quail, and egg laying strains of chickens of many breeds (including both heritage breeds and modern hybrids).

60|$|He alighted gaily on {{the open}} sward, between the Baby's Palace and the Serpentine, {{and the first thing}} he did was to lie on his back and kick. He was quite unaware already that he had ever been human, and thought he was a bird, even in appearance, just the same as in his early days, and when he tried to catch a fly he did not {{understand}} that the reason he missed it was because he had attempted to seize it with his hand, which, of course, a bird never does. He saw, however, that it must be past Lock-out Time, for there were a good many fairies about, all too busy to notice him; they were getting breakfast ready, milking their cows, drawing water, and so on, and the sight of the water-pails made him thirsty, so he flew over to the Round Pond to have a drink. He stooped and dipped his beak in the pond; he thought it was his beak, but, of course, it was only his nose, and therefore, very little water came up, and that not so refreshing as usual, so next he tried a puddle and he fell flop into it. When a real bird falls in flop, he spreads out his <b>feathers</b> and <b>pecks</b> them dry, but Peter could not remember what was the thing to do, and he decided rather sulkily to go to sleep on the weeping-beech in the Baby Walk.|$|R
2500|$|The {{benefits}} of beak trimming are mainly welfare advantages for birds kept in close confinement, {{some of which}} directly relate to increases (or reduced decreases) in production.

2500|$|<b>Feather</b> <b>pecking</b> occurs {{frequently}} amongst commercially reared turkeys and {{can begin}} at 1 day of age. [...] This behaviour {{is considered to}} be re-directed foraging behaviour, caused by providing poultry with an impoverished foraging environment. To reduce <b>feather</b> <b>pecking,</b> turkeys are often beak-trimmed. [...] Ultraviolet-reflective markings appear on young birds {{at the same time as}} <b>feather</b> <b>pecking</b> becomes targeted toward these areas, indicating a possible link. [...] Commercially reared turkeys also perform head-pecking, which becomes more frequent as they sexually mature. When this occurs in small enclosures or environments with few opportunities to escape, the outcome is often fatal and rapid. Frequent monitoring is therefore essential, particularly of males approaching maturity. Injuries to the head receive considerable attention from other birds, and head-pecking often occurs after a relatively minor injury has been received during a fight or when a lying bird has been trodden upon and scratched by another. [...] Individuals being re-introduced after separation are often immediately attacked again. Fatal head-pecking can occur even in small (10 birds), stable groups. Commercial turkeys are normally reared in single-sex flocks. If a male is inadvertently placed in a female flock, he may be aggressively victimised (hence the term 'henpecked'). Females in male groups will be repeatedly mated, during which it is highly likely she will be injured from being trampled upon.|$|E
2500|$|Beak {{trimming}} is {{most common}} in egg-laying strains of chickens. [...] In some countries such as the United States, turkeys routinely have their beaks trimmed, however, in the UK, only 10% of turkeys are beak trimmed.

[...] Commercial broiler chickens are not routinely beak trimmed as they reach slaughter weight at approximately 6 weeks of age, i.e. before injurious pecking usually begins. [...] However, broiler breeding stock may be trimmed to prevent damage during mating. [...] In some countries, beak trimming is done {{as a last resort}} where alternatives are considered not to be possible or appropriate.|$|E
40|$|Severe feather-pecking (SFP) is a multifactorial {{behaviour}} whereby birds peck at {{and pull}} out the feathers of conspecifics. It can result in extensive feather loss, wounds, and death in affected birds. Many causal factors {{have been identified in}} contributing to the expression of SFP, yet the underlying motivations for the behaviour are not fully understood. Despite over five decades of research, SFP persists as a highly deleterious and prevalent problem in the egg industry worldwide, with no effective method of control. SFP can occur at extremely high rates, with studies reporting between half and three-quarters of flocks surveyed as affected. SFP therefore represents a significant risk to hen welfare. In the last half century, increased intensification of animal production has taken place. Concurrently over recent years, there has been an increase in non-cage housing systems for laying hens. Since SFP is thought to be socially transmitted throughout a flock, it {{has been found to be}} particularly difficult to control in non-cage systems. SFP is thought to be inversely correlated with use of the outdoor range area, although few studies have investigated this relationship and factors which affect range use. Research to investigate why SFP occurs, and how it may be managed, is critical for the future of the egg industry, as well as hen welfare. Some research suggests that SFP is an abnormal behaviour, and may be used as an animal model for obsessive compulsive disorder in humans. Other studies hypothesise that it is triggered by the inhibition of ground-pecking, a foraging behaviour. Still others suggest that SFP has a nutritional basis, and is primarily performed with the intent to ingest feathers. Fearfulness is thought to play a role in the expression of SFP, but the causal relationship has not been determined, as well as whether the recipients or those performing SFP are more fearful. It is also not clear whether the gentle form of feather-pecking (GFP), which does not cause damage to the birds, acts as a precursor to SFP later in life. SFP has been widely controlled by beak-trimming (BT), whereby the tip of the beak is removed. BT does not address the cause of the behaviour, and is the subject of controversy and banned in a number of countries due to welfare reasons. Its effectiveness has also been questioned. There is a need for research to investigate the current need for BT, and potential alternatives. Chapter 1 gives a general introduction to the topics covered in this thesis. Chapter 2 provides a consolidated review of the research on the motivational basis for SFP, how SFP is affected by the environment, and how feeding behaviour and feather-eating are implicated. It was concluded in chapter 2 that more research should be conducted to investigate types of environmental enrichment (EE) that may enhance foraging behaviours as a method to reduce SFP. In addition, research is required on individual bird variation, and the underlying behavioural characteristics related to the expression of SFP. Further, while feather-eating is thought to be important in the expression of SFP, more research is required to understand the specific role it plays, and why some birds may have a greater appetite for feathers. Chapter 3 studies the effects of BT and EE during the rearing period, and plumage damage due to SFP later in life. Chapter 4 investigates some behavioural traits of pullets during the rearing period, how these are affected by the BT and EE treatments, and whether they may be predictive of SFP later in life. Sixteen pens of 50 ISA Brown laying hens were used (n = 800). The BT and EE treatments were applied in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Half of the birds were BT at 1 d of age using an infra-red laser, and a follow-up light-trim was performed at 11 weeks of age with a hot blade. Half of the birds received EE which comprised pecking strings, whole oats in the litter, and greater litter depth. Four focal birds were selected at random per pen, at 11 days of age (n = 64). In chapter 3, focal birds were subject to in situ behaviour observations from 3 to 14 weeks of age. BT birds performed less ground-pecking (P = 0. 003), less SFP (P = 0. 02) and more GFP (P = 0. 02) than their non-BT counterparts during the rearing period. These birds also exhibited less feather damage at 43 weeks of age (P < 0. 001). EE caused birds to perform more ground-scratching (P = 0. 03) and more dustbathing (P = 0. 01) during the rearing period, but had no effect on plumage damage at 43 weeks of age. There was also no interaction effect of BT and EE on plumage damage. It was concluded that BT was an effective method to control SFP and plumage damage, and while pullet behaviour was modified by EE during rearing, it was not effective in reducing SFP. In chapter 4, focal birds were subjected to well-validated behaviour tests; the open-field test (OFT) and the tonic immobility (TI) test, at 5 and 9 weeks of age, respectively. These tests were performed to estimate fearfulness, coping style, and social motivation. Non-BT birds vocalised more (P = 0. 02) and at louder volumes (P = 0. 02) in the OFT at 5 weeks of age, potentially indicating a higher need for social reinstatement. There were no differences between treatments in their levels of fearfulness, as assessed by the TI test (P = 0. 99). There were no predictive relationships between test responses at 5 weeks of age, and plumage damage at 43 weeks of age when analysed using ordinal regression. It was concluded that while the behavioural tests were not related to plumage damage later in life, BT may cause a decreased need for social reinstatement at a young age. Leading on from chapter 4, chapter 5 investigates some underlying behavioural traits of hens classified as feather-peckers, victims, or controls (n = 70). Focal birds were selected due to their involvement in SFP. Victims were selected due to extensive plumage damage, feather-peckers were selected due to the performance of SFP towards other birds, and controls were selected due to a lack of plumage damage and SFP. Control birds thereby appeared unaffected by SFP. The victims and feather-peckers were in pens in which SFP and plumage damage were evident, whereas the control birds were in pens in which little plumage damage was evident. Focal birds were subjected to an OFT and a TI test in the laying period, between 35 and 42 weeks of age, and observed in their home pens at 43 and 44 weeks of age. Birds in SFP pens performed (P = 0. 01) and received (P 0. 1). In the OFT, feather-peckers made more vocalisations (P < 0. 001) at higher volumes (P < 0. 001) than ‘victims’ of SFP, and also made more escape attempts (P = 0. 03). In the TI test, victims had longer latencies to right themselves than peckers (P < 0. 001). It was concluded that the higher levels of vocalisations and escape attempts made by peckers in the OFT may have been due to greater social motivation. The results of this chapter are therefore in agreement with the findings in chapter 4, that birds performing more SFP may be more socially motivated. When the results from chapters 4 and 5 are considered together, it appears that SFP causes increased fearfulness in victims, rather than fearfulness predisposing birds to perform SFP. Chapter 6 compares feather-eating between six SFP pens and six non-SFP pens (n = 12 pens, 600 hens). SFP was determined by feather-scoring and in situ behaviour observations. A second experiment in chapter 6 investigates the temporal relationship between feather-eating and SFP in 16 pens (n = 800 hens) to determine whether feather-eating may predict SFP. This was done by assessing feather-eating prior to the development of SFP, at 15 weeks of age, and again after SFP was apparent, at 40 weeks of age. In the first experiment, there was a clear relationship between SFP and feather-eating, where birds in pens with plumage damage had a higher probability of feather ingestion (P = 0. 02), and showed shorter latencies to peck at, and ingest loose feathers (P < 0. 001). Birds also ingested feathers from some birds faster than others (P < 0. 001). In the second experiment, birds tended to <b>peck</b> <b>feathers</b> taken from the rump more times than feathers sourced from the back at 40 weeks of age (P = 0. 06). These findings demonstrate that birds may preferentially ingest feathers from some birds and particular body areas. This was in line with anecdotal observations of plumage damage occurring mostly on the rump area. Birds <b>pecked</b> at the <b>feathers</b> more (P < 0. 001), had a higher probability of ingesting feathers (P < 0. 001), and <b>pecked</b> and ingested <b>feathers</b> more quickly (P < 0. 001) at 40 than 15 weeks of age. This suggests that birds had a heightened interest in ingesting feathers once SFP was occurring at an older age, although a predictive relationship was not determined due to a lack of variation in plumage damage between pens in this experiment. Chapter 7 investigates the relationships between fearfulness, plumage damage, and range use. Two pens of 50 hens (n = 100) were fitted with Radio Frequency Identification transponders at 26 weeks of age. The hens’ use of the outdoor range was then tracked continuously over a period of 13 days. Two subpopulations were then identified at the end of the trial: high range users (n = 15) and low range users (n = 15), based on their total time spent outside. These birds were subjected to TI tests and feather-scored at 29 weeks of age. There was no relationship between plumage damage and time spent outside on the range (P = 0. 68), but there was a negative association between TI duration and range use (P = 0. 01). This negative association suggests that fearful birds are less likely to use an outdoor range area. Chapter 7 indicates that Radio Frequency Identification technology provides a potential means for quantifying range use in laying hens, on which there is currently very little information. This thesis supports a relationship between fearfulness and SFP (chapter 5). SFP appeared to cause higher levels of fearfulness in the recipients, rather than fearfulness predisposing birds to perform SFP (chapters 4 and 5). Fearfulness was also negatively associated with time spent on the outside range area (chapter 7). While previous studies have found range use and plumage damage to be inversely correlated, this was not found in chapter 7. The relationships between fearfulness, SFP, and range use warrant further research, particularly in larger flock sizes. Social motivation appears to be implicated in the expression of SFP. Birds that performed more SFP (chapters 3 and 5) also demonstrated higher levels of social motivation in the OFTs (chapters 4 and 5). GFP did not predict plumage damage later in life (chapter 3), but was positively associated with SFP (chapter 5). Results from chapters 3 and 5 do not support the hypothesis that SFP is redirected ground-pecking. BT significantly reduced plumage damage. While there were no effects of EE on plumage damage, it appeared to enhance the behavioural repertoire during the period in which it was provided (chapter 3), and tended to reduce SFP received in the laying period (chapter 5). Feather-eating may play an important role in SFP (chapter 6), although investigation of a predictive relationship was precluded, and future research should focus on elucidating the relationship between feather-eating and SFP. This thesis provides information on: 	The short and longer term effects of EE and its interaction with BT. This knowledge could contribute to the development of appropriate husbandry and housing conditions for laying hens to minimise the expression of SFP. 	Feather-eating and its positive association with SFP. It is suggested that birds may have preferences for feathers from particular body areas and birds. 	Behavioural characteristics of pullets prior to the development of high rates of SFP and plumage damage, the usefulness of behavioural tests as predictors of SFP, and the congruency between two behavioural tests, the OFT and the TI test. 	Behavioural traits in birds expressing SFP compared with victimised birds. This information is important in developing standardised phenotypic characteristics of birds that perform SFP. Associated phenotypic characteristics may be utilised in breeding programs to control SFP on a broader scale. 	Range use, fearfulness, and plumage damage. Little is known about range use, why birds access the range area differentially within a flock, and how it may be related to SFP. Information in this area is therefore important to contribute to the understanding of laying hen behaviour and how best to manage and house laying hen flocks. Therefore, this thesis was successful in 1) increasing the understanding of why SFP occurs; 2) providing information on some of the underlying motivations of birds that perform SFP, 3) providing information on some potential methods for control, and 4) identifying avenues for further research...|$|R
2500|$|Because the beak is a {{sensitive}} organ with many sensory receptors, beak trimming (sometimes {{referred to as}} 'debeaking') is [...] "acutely painful" [...] to the birds it is performed on. It is nonetheless routinely done to intensively farmed poultry flocks, particularly laying and broiler breeder flocks, because it helps reduce the damage the flocks inflict on themselves due {{to a number of}} stress-induced behaviors, including cannibalism, vent pecking and <b>feather</b> <b>pecking.</b> A cauterizing blade or infrared beam is used to cut off about half of the upper beak and {{about a third of the}} lower beak. Pain and sensitivity can persist for weeks or months after the procedure, and neuromas can form along the cut edges. Food intake typically decreases for some period after the beak is trimmed. However, studies show that trimmed poultry's adrenal glands weigh less, and their plasma corticosterone levels are lower than those found in untrimmed poultry, indicating that they are less stressed overall.|$|E
2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of turkeys are reared indoors in purpose-built or modified buildings {{of which there are}} many types.

[...] The buildings can be very large (converted aircraft hangars are sometimes used) and may contain tens of thousands of birds as a single flock. The floor substrate is usually deep-litter, e.g. wood shavings, which relies upon the controlled build-up of a microbial flora requiring skilful management. Ambient temperatures for adult domestic turkeys are usually maintained between 18 and 21°C. High temperatures should be avoided because the high metabolic rate of turkeys (up to 69W/bird) makes them susceptible to heat stress, exacerbated by high stocking densities. [...] Commercial turkeys are kept under a variety of lighting schedules, e.g. continuous light, long photoperiods (23 h), or intermittent lighting, to encourage feeding and accelerate growth.

2500|$|Stereotypies are repetitive, {{sometimes}} abnormal behaviors like pacing on the perch for birds. There are adaptive stereotypic {{behaviors such}} as grooming in cats and preening in birds. Captive parrots commonly perform a range of stereotypies. These behaviors are repeated identically and lack any function or goal. Captive parrots perform striking oral and locomotor stereotypies like pacing on the perch or repetitive play with a certain toy. Feather picking and loud vocalizations can be stereotypies but are not as rigid and may be reactions to confinement, stress, boredom and loneliness {{as studies have shown}} that parrots that are in cages closest to the door are the most prone to feather pick or scream. Feather picking is not a true stereotypy and is more like hair pulling in human and loud vocalizations or screaming can be a stereotypy but vocalization is part of a parrot's natural behavior. [...] Captive parrots lack sufficient stimulation. Presumably they suffer from lack of companionship and opportunities to forage. [...] Stereotypies can evolve from the social environment for example {{the presence or absence of}} certain social stimuli, social isolation, low feeder space and high stocking density (especially for tail biting in pigs). These behaviors can also be transmitted through social learning.

50|$|<b>Feather</b> <b>pecking</b> is also {{distinct}} from another psychopathological behaviour called feather-plucking or feather-picking.

50|$|Early {{experience}} can influence severe <b>feather</b> <b>pecking</b> in later life.
