5|$|Fund-raising <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> {{was led by}} Terry McAuliffe, {{a friend}} of Clinton's who had also contributed heavily to the Clinton-Gore {{campaign}} in 1995. Clinton himself was prohibited by law from personally soliciting donations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> but he did host private events relating to the library. There were no other legal restrictions on donations, and the Clinton Foundation was able to accept unlimited private donations, {{all of which were}} tax deductible. Approximately $10 million of contributions came from Saudi Arabia. However, the Clinton Foundation declined to release a full donor list, similar to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library (although the foundation later agreed to disclose the top 150 donors to the House Government Reform Committee). Donations exceeding $1 million were also given from various other foreign governments (such as Kuwait and Taiwan), as well as foreign individuals. Various American organizations also contributed millions of dollars to the foundation.|$|E
5|$|In April 2002, Specht Properties was {{selected}} as the developer of the project after scoring higher with the council appointed committee formed to rate each of three developer's proposals, with Gerding/Edlen Development and Trammell Crow Company losing out to Specht. Construction on the complex began in June 2003 when an old grain store at the site was demolished to make room <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> A total of eight buildings were torn down to make room the complex as part of a redevelopment of a brownfield site.|$|E
5|$|After {{a year in}} San Diego, Washington {{was traded}} again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center Bill Walton even though Walton had missed the entire 1978–79 season due to broken bones in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers could not agree on compensation, the commissioner's office made the final decision, sending Washington, Kunnert and Randy Smith to Portland in {{exchange}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> This became {{the second time he}} had been traded along with Kunnert. The center signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season even though Washington was on the team because the Celtics offered him the most money. There remained a mostly quiet discord between the two as Washington felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.|$|E

5|$|Pei and {{his team}} also {{designed}} a united urban area for Washington, D.C., L'Enfant Plaza (named for French-American architect Pierre Charles L'Enfant). Pei's associate Araldo Cossutta was the lead architect for the plaza's North Building (955 L'Enfant Plaza SW) and South Building (490 L'Enfant Plaza SW). Vlastimil Koubek was the architect for the East Building (L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, located at 480 L'Enfant Plaza SW), and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Center</b> Building (475 L'Enfant Plaza SW; now the United States Postal Service headquarters). The team set out with a broad vision that was praised by both the Washington Post and Washington Star (which rarely agreed on anything), but funding problems forced revisions and {{a significant reduction in}} scale.|$|E
5|$|Renovations {{included}} {{adding a}} new roof, creating a new entrance, adding an elevator, among other changes. Creating a new entrance involved removing hand quarried stone from the walls to enlarge a window opening. The remodeling also brought the building up to modern seismic codes and {{to comply with the}} Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). City officials hoped to maintain the character of the original structure despite changes and upgrades. The total cost for renovations as of opening were $2.4 million, with the city paying for 60% of those costs. Some financing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> came from selling bricks to the public that were then used on exterior spaces.|$|E
5|$|The Arizona Jewish Historical Society {{undertook}} a $4 million campaign in 2007 {{to raise the}} funds needed to restore the original synagogue building and other related structures to create the Cutler-Plotkin Jewish Heritage Center. The plan was <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Center</b> to include a museum and other public spaces {{that would be used}} to show the connection between the history of the Jewish community as part of Arizona's history. A $150,000 grant had been received in May of that year from the Arizona State Heritage Fund. By August 2008 much of the work of the first phase – the restoration of the sanctuary and annex – had been completed, and $2.1 million of the $2.6 million required for the work had been raised.|$|E

5|$|Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Hellen of March 2014 {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} tropical cyclones in the Mozambique Channel on record, as well as the most intense of the 2013–14 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. It formed on March26 in the northern portion of the channel, and in its formative stages brought rainfall to coastal Mozambique. While moving southeastward, it developed an organized area of convection over the center. Warm waters allowed Hellen to rapidly intensify while passing south of the Comoros, with a well-defined eye forming in the middle of the thunderstorms. The cyclone attained peak intensity March30, with maximum sustained winds estimated 230km/h (145mph) according to the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, Météo-France in La Réunion. Subsequently, Hellen weakened quickly due to dry air and interaction with Madagascar, and the eye dissipated. On March31, the storm made landfall in northwestern Madagascar as a weakened cyclone, despite previous forecasts <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> to remain over water. By April1, Hellen was no longer a tropical cyclone after most of the convection dissipated. The remnants turned to the west, moving over Mozambique without redeveloping.|$|E
5|$|Justice David Josiah Brewer's {{death on}} March 28, 1910 gave Taft a second {{opportunity}} {{to fill a}} seat on the high court; he chose New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes. Taft told Hughes that should the chief justiceship fall vacant during his term, Hughes would be his likely choice <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> seat. The Senate quickly confirmed Hughes, but then Chief Justice Fuller died on July 4, 1910. Taft took five months to replace Fuller, and when he did, it was with Justice Edward Douglass White, who became the first associate justice to be promoted to chief justice. According to Lurie, Taft, who still had hopes of being chief justice, may have been more willing to appoint an older man than he (White) than a younger one (Hughes), who might outlive him, as indeed Hughes did. To fill White's seat as associate justice, Taft appointed Willis Van Devanter of Wyoming, a federal appeals judge. By the time Taft nominated White and Van Devanter in December 1910, he had another seat to fill due to William Henry Moody's retirement because of illness; he named a Louisiana Democrat, Joseph R. Lamar, whom he had met while playing golf, and had subsequently learned had a good reputation as a judge.|$|E
5|$|On October 24, 1979, church {{president}} Spencer W. Kimball visited Jerusalem {{to dedicate}} the Orson Hyde Memorial Gardens, {{located on the}} Mount of Olives. The church had donated money to beautify the Jerusalem area, and officials of the Jerusalem government were present at the occasion. It was at this dedication that Kimball announced the church's intent to build a center for BYU students in the city. Negotiations between {{the church and the}} Israeli government stretched from 1980-1984. The land the church wanted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> located at the northwestern margin of Mount Olivet, right next to the valley which separates it from Mount Scopus, had been acquired by Israel during the Six Day War of 1967 and could not be sold under Israeli law. The church decided to obtain a lease on the land instead. Leasing the land also prevented the politically controversial problem of the church owning a piece of Jerusalem land. Israeli officials saw the building of the center on the land as a way of solidifying control over land whose ownership was ambiguous under international law. By August 1984, the church had the land on a 49-year lease, building permits had been obtained, and construction on the building began.|$|E

5|$|The concert {{tour was}} being {{discussed}} by executives {{as early as}} January2007. It was announced on August8,2007 via press release. It was confirmed that the tour would be promoted by AEG Live and Buena Vista Concerts, a division of The Walt Disney Company. It also featured American band and labelmates the Jonas Brothers as opening act. The tour would expand throughout North America, from October18,2007 in St. Louis, Missouri to January9,2008 in Albany, New York, {{with a total of}} fifty-four dates; fifty-three of which were in the United States and one which was in Canada. In October2007, another date was annexed in order to meet demand. In December2007, a fourteen-date extension of the tour was announced, with American duo Aly & A.J. opening seven of them; the opening act for the remaining dates was yet be announced. The extension featured new opening acts because the Jonas Brothers pulled out to record their then-forthcoming album A Little Bit Longer (2008). Subsequently, in the same month, one final date was annexed, and the American band Everlife was announced to as the final opening act. One dollar from each ticket purchased was donated to the City of Hope National Medical Center, a center dedicated to the prevention, treatment and research for the cure of cancer. In total, the Best of Both Worlds Tour raised over US $2million <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E
