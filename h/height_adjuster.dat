40|$|The {{self-locking}} gear {{has great}} potential application in controlling the position stability of gearbox, {{which is a}} critical requirement in some precision machineries and instruments. However, the design procedure, load capacity, and dynamic behaviours of self-locking gear has not been investigated and systemized, {{which is a great}} barrier for the potential users. This research focuses on addressing these issues by developing new mathematical models and finite element method. Moreover, in this PhD project, we attempt to investigate the design method of the self-locking gear in seat <b>height</b> <b>adjuster,</b> which may eliminate the back-driving thereby improving the occupant driving comfort, enhance the driving safety, and reduce the volume of gearbox. A comprehensive literature review of spur gear, helical gear and epicyclical gear is presented in chapter 2. Chapter 3 gives an introduction of the analytical models of gear geometry, gear load capacity, and dynamics. Chapter 4 elaborates the procedure of finite element analysis. Chapter 5 presents the effects of different parameters on self-locking gear pairs. The dynamic performance of self-locking gears are presented in the Chapter 6. Chapter 7 depicts the mathematical models of seat cushion structure and plastic gears used to design the self-locking gear in seat height adjusters. Chapter 8 draws the conclusions and recommends the potential further In summary, this thesis developed a new finite element method to investigate the static and dynamic characteristics of self-locking gear. The effects of torque, tip radius, centre to centre distance error and misalignment axes on self-locking gear pairs were quantified. The non-linear dynamic behaviour of self-locking gear system subjected to the variation ratio of contact length were clarified. The design method of self-locking gear system in seat <b>height</b> <b>adjuster</b> subject to the automotive seat structure and plastic gears were developed. The obtained results in this thesis provide significant knowledge for predicting the static and dynamic performance of self-locking gear pairs, optimizing their design parameters, and diagnosing possible design errors in self-locking gear pair design.

40|$|The {{automobile}} seat is {{an important}} and unique device in the automobile system, which directly contacts the human body. The dynamic characteristics of the automobile seat are the key parameters for its vibration security and dynamic performance. Both experiments and finite element simulations are conducted to analyse the fore-and-aft operating modes of {{a new type of}} automobile seat system in this paper. The results and their correlation analysis between the experimental data and the computational models are given. By using finite element simulations, the computational results of the modes with the first 12 orders for the automobile seat are in the range 0 - 100 Hz, including the integral modes and the local modes of the automobile seat. An experimental method was designed to measure the seat frame mode using an impact hammer, a triaxial accelerometer, uniaxial accelerometers and a 24 -channel LMS vibration test system. The experimental data were analysed by estimating the frequency response function and the modal parameters and validated using LMS Test. Lab software. The experimental results for five integral modal parameters of the automobile seat between 0 Hz and 100 Hz are given. The orthogonal experimental method is used to design nine different working states of the automobile seat with variations in the positions of different adjustable devices (the headrest, the <b>height</b> <b>adjuster,</b> the recliner and the track slide). Finally, the influences of the above-mentioned adjustable devices on the fore-and-aft operating mode are analysed by the single-factor analysis method using finite element simulations...|$|E

40|$|LiDAR {{remote sensing}} can be {{considered}} a key instrument for studies related to quantifying the vegetation structure. We utilised LiDAR metrics to estimate plot-scale structural parameters of subtropical rainforest and eucalypt-dominated open forest in topographically dissected landscape in north-eastern Australia. This study is considered an extreme application of LiDAR technology for structurally complex subtropical forests in complex terrain. A total of 31 LiDAR metrics of vegetation functional parameters were examined. Multiple linear regression models were able to explain 62 % of the variability associated with basal area, 66 % for mean diameter at breast height, 61 % for dominant height and 60 % for foliage projective cover in subtropical rainforest. In contrast, mean <b>height</b> (<b>adjusted</b> r² = 0. 90) and dominant <b>height</b> (<b>adjusted</b> r² = 0. 81) were predicted with highest accuracy in the eucalypt-dominated open canopy forest.

40|$|This report {{documents}} a {{study of}} how CRS features, labels, and instructions contribute to CRS installation errors. Task 1 A focused on assessing different physical features of 16 convertible CRS, while Task 1 B evaluated baseline and modified versions of labels and instructions for two CRS models. For each phase of testing, 32 subjects were recruited based on their education level (high or low) and experience with installing CRS (none or experienced). Each subject was asked to perform four child restraint installations in a 2006 Pontiac G 6 sedan. An 18 -month-old CRABI anthropometric test device (ATD) weighing 25 lb was used for all installations. Each subject installed two CRS forward-facing (FF), one with LATCH and one with seatbelt, and two CRS rear-facing (RF), one with LATCH and one with the seatbelt. For Task 1 A, each subject installed four of the sixteen convertible CRS. For Task 1 B, each subject installed a Graco ComfortSport and Evenflo Titan twice, where each CRS had one of eight alternate instruction manuals and one of eight alternate label conditions. After each installation, the experimenter evaluated 42 factors for each installation, such as choice of belt routing path, tightness of installation, and harness snugness. Analyses used linear mixed models to identify CRS installation outcomes associated with CRS features or label/ instruction type. LATCH connector type, LATCH belt adjustor type, {{and the presence of}} belt lockoffs are associated with the tightness of the CRS installation. The type of harness shoulder <b>height</b> <b>adjuster</b> is associated with the rate of achieving a snug harness. Correct tether use is associated with the tether storage method. In general, subject assessments of the ease of use of CRS features are not highly correlated with the quality of their installation, suggesting a need for feedback with incorrect installations. The results of testing alternative labels and instructions indicate that no alternative condition significantly improved CRS installation compared to baseline conditions across all potential installation errors that were evaluated. An unintended consequence of using “combined” labels (incorporating all of the variations recommended by human factors experts that were tested individually in other conditions) is that subjects were less likely to use the CRS manual. The most promising alternative manual is a video version. Neither the labels nor manuals with improved graphics showed substantial benefit compared to baseline, even though graphics-based manuals and labels score well using the ISO and NHTSA ease-of-use rating system. The effects of varying labels and manuals on installation error are small compared to the effects of different CRS designs. The data from this study provide quantitative assessments of some CRS features that are associated with reductions in CRS installation errors. This information can be used to update the NHTSA CRS ease-of-use rating system to account for recently developed CRS features. Based on human factors recommendations, suggestions are made for assessing “clear” labels and instructions and modifying FMVSS 213 requirements to facilitate clearer labels and instructions...|$|E

Lung function was measured and details of respiratory illness and smoking histories were collected from subjects attending surveys at three year intervals from 1966 to 1984. Data from ex-smokers and asthmatic patients (diagnosis based on answer to questionnaire) were excluded. Regression of <b>height</b> <b>adjusted</b> forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) on age was calculated individually for 759 non-smokers and 225 regular smokers with four or more observations.

In smokers the rate of decline in FEV 1 was greater than in non-smokers and was related to the amount smoked, to the extent that a smoker could expect a 20 - 30 % greater rate of decline than a non-smoker of the same age. Chronic airflow limitation (defined as FEV 1 /FEV less than 65 % or FEV 1 less than 65 % predicted on at least two occasions) was common, occurring in 24 % of men and 18 % of women who were regular smokers and in 5 % of male and 8 % of female non-smokers.
