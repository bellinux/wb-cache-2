5|$|The {{people of}} South Park decide to turn Muhammad {{over to the}} Gingers, fearing the {{violence}} that will befall their town if they do not. The celebrities are angered by this change in events, but refuse to resort to violence for fear of ruining their careers. Instead, the celebrities decide to awaken the rebuilt Mecha-Streisand, a giant mechanical monster form of Barbra Streisand, who previously terrorized the town of South Park before being destroyed. The celebrities hope to use Mecha-Streisand to force South Park to accept their demands. Meanwhile, due to the chain of events, Cartman decides Connor's scheme has become too complicated and tries to quit, but Connor convinces him to stay involved by revealing that the townspeople of South Park <b>have</b> <b>lied</b> to Cartman about his true father. Although they previously claimed his hermaphroditic mother was also his father, Connor insists this is a lie. Cartman confronts his school teacher Mr. Garrison and Garrison's old hand puppet Mr. Hat, who admits to Cartman there was indeed a cover-up. Mecha-Streisand roars threateningly and continues her reign of destruction as the episode ends.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} effects of raising {{children}} and having a career simultaneously are mostly seen in women throughout many societies, the men in such situations are affected greatly as well. This is not seen in all situations in males because the effects on men differ greatly from how females are affected by this extra responsibility. In The Canadian Family in Crisis, the author suggests a reason for these effects to go unnoticed in most studies and surveys. This is because women's stress can be seen through direct labor consisting of housework and career whereas men's stress, in most cases, mostly come from decision making and work-family conflicts. These situations arise where the male must make {{the best choice for}} the future of his family. Specifically, these include things such as workload, overtime hours, shift decisions, and even accepting a promotion or a transfer. In these situations, the man is forced to make major choices that will affect the entire family, which brings on more stress. The effects also go unnoticed since, in traditional gender roles, the male {{is supposed to be the}} backbone of the family and, in the past, it would have been seen as weakness for the male to display his emotions to the rest of the family. In surveys and studies done, most males would not like to be seen as too weak to handle his responsibilities as the role of the adult male in the household, which in the past has consisted of being the major economical supporter and physical figure for the family. With this in mind, it is very possible that some may <b>have</b> <b>lied</b> when surveyed about these topics.|$|E

5|$|When Silva {{was arrested}} in October 2012, he confessed {{to the murder of}} Martínez Pérez. Investigators and {{authorities}} in Veracruz concluded that the journalist was killed during a robbery. But when placed before a judge, Silva retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured, held hostage for over a week, and threatened by Veracruz authorities in order to make him confess to the assassination. Silva said that officials had threatened to kill his mother, his last remaining family member. During a press conference, the Veracruz authorities relied solely on the confession of Silva as evidence against him. None of them made references to DNA, fingerprint, or blood samples from the murder scene. Sources close to the Committee to Protect Journalists stated that the samples collected at the crime scene do not match those of any of the criminals listed on the national database. This should rule out both Silva and Domínguez (who is still at large) from the murder, because both of them have extensive criminal records. Proceso news magazine immediately took a critical stance toward the investigation and said that they did not believe that the Veracruz authorities were capable of completing a clean investigation. The Committee to Protect Journalists believes that the murder case was possibly fabricated, and that Silva was likely used as a scapegoat by the authorities. Just a few items were stolen from Martínez Pérez's house while valuable goods were left behind, so they allege that theft was not the real motive behind her murder. According to Mexican law, Proceso was allowed to participate in the investigation, so they appointed a top journalist to cover every detail of it. Proceso has complained that the Veracruz authorities <b>have</b> <b>lied</b> to them regarding possible developments in the investigation.|$|E

Of the total enlistment, more than 130,000 were foreign-born, including 20,000 from British North American possessions such as Canada. 51,000 were Irish and 37,000 German. The average age of the New York soldiers was 25 years, 7 months, although many younger men and boys may <b>have</b> <b>lied</b> about their age in order to enlist.|$|E
25|$|Many Moon-landing {{conspiracy}} theories {{have been put}} forward: claiming either that the landings did not happen and that NASA employees <b>have</b> <b>lied,</b> or that the landings did happen {{but not in the}} way that has been told. Conspiracists have focused on perceived gaps or inconsistencies in the historical record of the missions. The foremost idea is that the whole manned landing program was a hoax from start to end. Some claim that the technology to send men to the Moon was lacking or that the Van Allen radiation belts, solar flares, solar wind, coronal mass ejections and cosmic rays made such a trip impossible.|$|E
25|$|The {{background}} to the dispute centres on the referee's perceptions that the SFA were {{not doing enough}} to protect them from undue criticism and questions over their integrity from football clubs, leading to increasing fears for their personal safety as controversial decisions were debated by the media and fans. After referee Dougie McDonald was found to <b>have</b> <b>lied</b> to his supervisor and Celtic manager Neil Lennon after a game on 17 October 2010, the ensuing controversy and debate led to referees voting to strike on 21 November in an attempt to achieve substantial changes in the game.

25|$|In January 1965, {{five months}} after Bolden's trial and sentencing, Spagnoli was found guilty on {{counterfeiting}} charges and sentenced to fifteen years. At his trial, Spagnoli said his livelihood was gambling, that he had falsely testified in Bolden's trial that his mother supported him, and that this false testimony was suborned by the government counsel {{in order to improve}} the jury's opinion of him. He said that he lied about the date of his first contact with Agent Martineau and may <b>have</b> <b>lied</b> about other dates. On the basis of this information, Bolden appealed his conviction as well as the denial of a motion for a retrial to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. In addition, he claimed that Perry's Allen charge in the first trial was evidence that Perry was not impartial and that his failure to recuse himself denied Bolden a fair trial.|$|E
25|$|Hasan {{was born}} in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to Pakistani {{expatriate}} parents, and attended Jawahir International School in Riyadh, playing for the school team in inter-school competitions. In Pakistan, he played inter-district under-19 matches for a Lahore East Zone Whites team during the 2007–08 season, and the following season progressed to inter-regional level, playing four games for the Lahore Shalimar under-19 side. The selection process for the team, which with the Lahore Ravi under-19s made up the Lahore intake for the National Academy, was controversial, with several players cut from the squad after being found to <b>have</b> <b>lied</b> about their ages. In October 2009, Hasan was named in the Lahore Ravi squad for the 2009–10 Quaid-i-Azam Trophy. He made his first-class debut during the same month, against Multan, and scored 10 and 19 coming in third behind Kashif Siddiq and Sohail Ahmed. His second and final match of the season came against Sialkot, and he scored 10 and 37 (the second innings taking almost three hours and 137 balls to complete).|$|E

It became a central plank of the prosecution's case that the father had made no such call, and that the only reason Bamber would <b>have</b> <b>lied</b> about it—indeed, {{the only way he could}} have known about the shootings when he alerted the police—was that he was the killer himself.|$|E

500|$|The {{questions}} about the veracity of Chatwin's writing are compounded by the revelation of his sexual orientation and the true cause of his death. Once it became known that Chatwin had been bisexual and had died of an AIDS-related illness, some critics viewed him as a liar and dismissed his work. Nicholas Shakespeare said, [...] "His denial [...] bred a sense that if he lied about his life, he must <b>have</b> <b>lied</b> about his work. Some readers have taken this as a cue to pass judgement on his books – or else not to bother with them." [...] In 2010 The Guardian's review of Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin opened with the question, [...] "Does anyone read Bruce Chatwin these days?" [...] However, Rory Stewart has stated, [...] "His personality, his learning, his myths, and even his prose are less hypnotizing [...] And yet he remains a great writer, of deep and enduring importance.” In 2008 The Times [...] named Chatwin #46 on their list of [...] "50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945".|$|E
500|$|In July 1998, the Church held a large devival at a [...] "clothing-optional" [...] {{campground}} in Sherman, New York, {{attended by}} about 400members. The event was ostensibly intended {{to celebrate the}} coming of aliens. When their appearance was not detected using the technology available at that time, Stang speculated that they might arrive in 8661, an inversion of 1998; this has been interpreted as a satire {{of the way that}} religious groups have revised prophecies after their failures. Some critics have dismissed the event as a prank or form of [...] "performance art". Steve Bevilacqua, the Church's business manager, admitted that his group made strange predictions about aliens, but contended that their statements were as believable as the account of Jesus' walk on water. Another theory is that The Conspiracy has lied about what year the present year actually is (just as they <b>have</b> <b>lied</b> about everything else), so that the liberation date would seem to pass without fulfillment and cause followers to lose faith. As a precaution, SubGenius members continue to gather for X-Day every July 5 after 1998. At these events, the non-appearance of the aliens is celebrated. Cusack casts the productions as carnivalesque or an echo of ancient Greek satyr plays.|$|E
500|$|The Arbiter's first {{mission is}} to silence a renegade Elite who has been preaching that the Prophets <b>have</b> <b>lied</b> to the Covenant. The Arbiter is then sent to {{retrieve}} the [...] "Sacred Icon" [...] from the library on the newly discovered Delta Halo, in order to activate the ring and bring about the Great Journey, the Covenant's concept of salvation. Though he retrieves the Icon, the Arbiter is betrayed by the Chieftain of the Brutes, Tartarus; Tartarus reveals that the Prophets have given him and his race carte blanche to massacre the Elites and replace them in the Covenant caste system. Though the Arbiter is believed dead, he is rescued—along with his nemesis, the human soldier Master Chief—by the parasitic Flood intelligence Gravemind. Gravemind reveals that the Great Journey actually spells doom for all sentient life, and sends him to stop Tartarus from activating the ring. In the process of stopping the Brute, the Arbiter and his Elites forge an alliance with the humans Miranda Keyes and Avery Johnson, and the Arbiter slays Tartarus with help from Johnson, halting the firing of the ring. The unexpected shutdown of Halo triggers a standby sequence, which the Arbiter learns has made all the Halo installations ready to fire remotely from a place known as the Ark.|$|E

500|$|An earlier {{draft of}} the {{screenplay}} had Ralph and Vanellope spending time going around the game world to collect the pieces for her kart for Sugar Rush, and at times included Felix traveling with the pair. During these scenes, Ralph would <b>have</b> <b>lied</b> to Felix regarding his budding relationship with Calhoun, leading eventually to Ralph becoming depressed and abandoning his quest to get his medal back. At this point, a fourth game world, Extreme Easy Living 2, would have been introduced and was considered a [...] "hedonistic place" [...] between the social nature of The Sims and the open-world objective-less aspects of Grand Theft Auto, according to Moore. Ralph would go there too, wallowing in his depression, and would find happiness by gaining [...] "Like It" [...] buttons for doing acceptable actions in the party-like nature of the place. Moore stated that while {{it was difficult to}} consider dropping this new game world, they found that its introduction {{in the second half of}} the film would be too difficult a concept for the viewer to grasp. They further had trouble working out how a social game would be part of an arcade, and though they considered having the game be running on Litwak's laptop, they ultimately realized that justifying the concept would be too convoluted. [...] Line art sketches and voice-over readings of the scene were included on the home media release of the film.|$|E
500|$|Canning's {{trial was}} marked by the prosecution's {{inability}} to find any evidence whatsoever {{that she had been}} anywhere but in Wells's home, and where Canning was in January 1753 remains unknown. [...] Similarly, mystery surrounds the precise movements of the Squires family, when it was supposed they were travelling through Dorset early in 1753. [...] The writer F. J. Harvey Darton suspected that the family were smugglers, and that it was significant they had passed through Eggardon, where Isaac Gulliver operated (although Gulliver was, at the time, a child). [...] The 18th-century artist Allan Ramsay claimed that Canning's initial story was [...] "exceedingly stupid", and false. [...] He viewed the lack of detail in her testimony as unsurprising to a more analytical mind. [...] The US author Lillian Bueno McCue theorised that she was an amnesiac, and that her former employer, John Wintlebury, was to blame for her imprisonment at the Wells house. [...] Treherne (1989) considers this theory very unlikely however, and instead concludes that Canning was almost certainly at Enfield Wash, but was not kept prisoner at Wells's home. [...] He suggests that Robert Scaratt implanted the suggestion that Canning had been held at the Wells's house, as a useful decoy, and that he had somehow been involved in an unwanted pregnancy. [...] Treherne also suggests that Canning was suffering from partial amnesia, and that she may not <b>have</b> <b>lied</b> intentionally at the trial of Squires and Wells. [...] He calls Canning [...] "the first media product." [...] Although some early authors adopted the same stance as Fielding or Hill, who actively took sides in the affair, most later writers believe that Canning did not tell the truth. [...] Moore (1994), however, believes that Canning was probably innocent. Moore explains discrepancies between Canning and the Squires' testimonies as understandable omissions and modifications, and placing much emphasis on the ability of those men in power to follow their own pursuits—often at the expense of others.|$|E
