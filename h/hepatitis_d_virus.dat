40|$|The {{circulating}} recombinant form (CRF) 07 _BC is {{the most}} prevalent HIV- 1 strain among injection drug users (IDUs) in Taiwan. It contains a 7 amino-acid deletion in its p 6 gag. We conducted a cohort study to compare viral loads and CD 4 cell count changes between patients infected with subtype B and CRF 07 _BC and to elucidate its mechanism. Twenty-one patients infected with CRF 07 _BC and 59 patients with subtype B were selected from a cohort of 667 HIV- 1 /AIDS patients whom have been followed up for 3 years. Generalized estimated equation was used to analyze their clinical data and {{the results showed that}} patients infected with CRF 07 _BC had significantly lower viral loads (about 58, 000 copies per ml less) than patients with subtype B infection (p =  0. 002). The replicative capacity of nine CRF 07 _BC and four subtype B isolates were compared and the results showed that the former had significantly lower replicative capacity than the latter although all of them were CCR 5 - tropic and non-syncytium inducing viruses. An HIV- 1 -NL 4 - 3 mutant virus which contains a 7 amino-acid deletion in p 6 gag (designated as 7 <b>d</b> <b>virus)</b> was generated and its live cycle was investigated. The results showed that 7 <b>d</b> <b>virus</b> had significantly lower replication capacity, poorer protease-mediated processing and viral proteins production. Electron microscopic examination of cells infected with wild-type or 7 <b>d</b> <b>virus</b> demonstrated that the 7 <b>d</b> <b>virus</b> had poorer and slower viral maturation processes: more viruses attached to the cell membrane and higher proportion of immature virions outside the cells. The interaction between p 6 gag and Alix protein was less efficient in cells infected with 7 <b>d</b> <b>virus.</b> In conclusion, patients infected with CRF 07 _BC had significantly lower viral loads than patients infected with subtype B and it may due to the deletion of 7 amino acids which overlaps with Alix protein-binding domain of the p 6 gag...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{benefits}} and limits of surgery for primary hepatic lymphoma (PHL), and probability of survival after postoperative chemotherapy. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was undertaken to determine the results of surgical treatment of PHL over the past 8 years. Only nine patients underwent such treatment. The detailed data of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis were carefully studied. RESULTS: All patients were mistaken as having α-fetoprotein-negative hepatic cancer before pathological diagnosis. The mean delay time between initial symptoms and final diagnosis was 26. 8 d (range: 14 - 47 <b>d).</b> <b>Hepatitis</b> B <b>virus</b> infection was noted in 33. 3 % of these patients. Most of the lesions {{were found to be}} restricted to a solitary hepatic mass. The surgical procedure performed was left hepatectomy in five cases, including left lateral segmentectomy in three. Right hepatectomy was performed in three cases and combined procedures in one. One patient died on the eighth day after surgery, secondary to hepatic insufficiency. The cumulative 6 -mo, 1 -year, and 2 -year survival rates after hepatic surgery were, respectively, 85. 7 %, 71. 4 %, and 47. 6 %. One patient survived for > 5 years after surgery without any signs of recurrence until latest follow-up, who received routine postoperative chemotherapy every month for 2 years and then regular follow-up. By univariate analysis, postoperative chemotherapy was a significant prognostic factor that influenced survival (P = 0. 006). CONCLUSION: PHL is a rare entity that is often misdiagnosed, and has a potential association with chronic hepatitis B infection. The prognosis is variable, with good response to early surgery combined with postoperative chemotherapy in strictly selected patients...|$|R
40|$|Introduction & aim. Faldaprevir is {{a potent}} once-daily (q. <b>d.)</b> <b>hepatitis</b> C <b>virus</b> (HCV) NS 3 / 4 A {{protease}} inhibitor. The STARTVerso 1 and STARTVerso 2 phase 3 studies evaluated faldaprevir plus peginterferon alfa- 2 a/ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV) in treatment-naïve patients with chronic HCV genotype- 1 infection. Material and methods. Patients were randomized 1 : 2 : 2 to receive placebo, faldaprevir 120 mg q. d. (12 or 24 weeks) or faldaprevir 240 mg q. d. (12 weeks) all with PegIFN/RBV (24 – 48 weeks). Faldaprevir 120 mg for 12 weeks only (STARTVerso 1 only) required early treatment success (ETS, HCV RNA < 25 IU/mL at week 4 and undetected at week 8). All faldaprevir-treated patients with ETS stopped PegIFN/RBV at week 24. Primary endpoint: sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR 12). Results. SVR 12 rates were significantly higher for patients treated with faldaprevir 120 or 240 mg (72 % and 73 %, respectively) compared with placebo (50 %); estimated differences (adjusted for trial, race, and genotype- 1 subtype) faldaprevir 120 mg 24 % (95 % CI: 17 – 31 %, P < 0. 0001), faldaprevir 240 mg 23 % (95 % CI: 16 – 30 %, P < 0. 0001). Subgroup analyses consistently showed higher SVR 12 rates for patients receiving faldaprevir compared with placebo. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar in faldaprevir 120 -mg and placebo groups and slightly higher in the faldaprevir 240 -mg group. Serious AEs were reported in 6 %, 7 %, and 8 % of patients in placebo, faldaprevir 120 -mg, and faldaprevir 240 -mg groups, respectively. Conclusion. Addition of faldaprevir to PegIFN/RBV increased SVR 12 in patients with HCV genotype- 1, and was well tolerated. Faldaprevir 120 mg is effective {{in the treatment of}} HCV genotype- 1.

Emerging Infectious Diseases, 22 (8), 1517 - 1519. doi: 10. 3201 /eid 2208. 160362 Although the provisionally named influenza D virus was first isolated as an influenza C–like virus from pigs with respiratory illness in Oklahoma in 2011 (1, 2), epidemiologic analyses suggested that cattle are major reservoirs of this virus (3) and {{the virus is}} potentially involved in the bovine respiratory disease complex. The high rates of illness and death related to this disease in feedlot cattle are caused by multiple factors, including several viral and bacterial co-infections. Influenza D viruses were detected in cattle and pigs with respiratory diseases (and in some healthy cattle) in China (4), France (5), Italy (6), among other countries, indicating their wide global geographic distribution. Although the influenza D virus, like the human influenza C virus, is known to use 9 -O-acetylated sialic acids as the cell receptor (2, 7), its zoonotic potential is undefined because of limited research (1, 8).

Several strains of mice that are resistant to LP-BM 5 -induced murine AIDS have been identified, and major histocompatibility complex genes as well as non-major histocompatibility complex genes were shown {{to play a role in}} this resistance. In the present study, we have examined and compared the replication of the BM 5 d and BM 5 e viruses after inoculation of LP-BM 5 into sensitive (C 57 BL/ 6 J) and resistant (C 57 BL/KSJ) mice. Using a specific polymerase chain reaction, we could detect the BM 5 d and BM 5 e proviruses as early as 1 week postinfection in the sensitive mice, and the levels of both viruses increased significantly with the progression of the disease. In contrast, in the resistant C 57 BL/KSJ mice, replication of BM 5 d and BM 5 e was restricted and no BM 5 d and only very low levels of the BM 5 e provirus could be detected either at early or late times postinoculation with the LP-BM 5 virus mixture. Inoculation with LP-BM 5 did not lead to the production of antibodies that could recognize the BM 5 d-encoded Pr 60 gag in either the sensitive or resistant mice; however, production of antibodies recognizing the env-related proteins of the helper virus was detected in the resistant but not in the sensitive mice at late times postinfection. Interestingly, inoculation with LP-BM 5 increased polyclonal stimulation of spleen cells and decreased mitogen stimulation in both strains of mice. This stimulation of splenocytes persisted in the sensitive mice but decreased after a few weeks in the resistant mice. These results show an early block in BM 5 d and BM 5 e replication in the resistant C 57 BL/KSJ mice and indicate that resistance is a consequence of the inhibition of an onset of the BM 5 <b>d</b> <b>virus</b> infection and its expansion. However, initial responses to virus infection such as proliferation of spleen cells and response to mitogen are similar in both strains of mice and are therefore not necessarily related to the development of the disease...|$|R

Regarding other parasites, the overall prevalence of parasitism was 26 % in owned shepherd and hunting dogs examined in Serres. Furthermore, seroepidemiological studies revealed the presence of antibodies against T. gondii in a considerable percentage of hospitalized children. Rotaviruses were confirmed as a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in children. Finally, bacterial zoonotic enteropathogens were identified in a notable number of pediatric cases.

Although countries like Japan and South Korea in the Far East were free of FMD, in 2010 FMD serotype O (O/Mya- 98) outbreaks were recorded {{and since then}} South Korea has experienced several FMD outbreaks despite regular vaccination. In this study a total of 85 serotype O FMD viruses (FMDV) isolated from 2007 to 2012 from SEA, East Asia and Far East were characterized by virus neutralisation tests using antisera to four existing (O/HKN/ 6 / 83, O/IND/R 2 / 75, O/SKR/ 2010 and O/PanAsia- 2) and one putative (O/MYA/ 2009) vaccine strains, and by full capsid sequencing.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{reported that a}} recombinant ICP 27 -null virus stimulated, but did not prevent, apoptosis in human HEp- 2 cells during infection (M. Aubert and J. A. Blaho, J. Virol. 73 : 2803 – 2813, 1999). In the present study, we used a panel of 15 recombinant ICP 27 mutant viruses to determine which features of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) replication are required for the apoptosis-inhibitory activity. Each virus was defined experimentally as either apoptotic, partially apoptotic, or nonapoptotic based on infected HEp- 2 cell morphologies, percentages of infected cells with condensed chromatin, and patterns of specific cellular death factor processing. <b>Viruses</b> <b>d</b> 27 - 1, d 1 - 5, d 1 - 2, M 11, M 15, M 16, n 504 R, n 406 R, n 263 R, and n 59 R are apoptotic or partially apoptotic in HEp- 2 cells and severely defective for growth in Vero cells. <b>Viruses</b> <b>d</b> 2 - 3, d 3 - 4, d 4 - 5, d 5 - 6, and d 6 - 7 are nonapoptotic, demonstrating that ICP 27 contains a large amino-terminal region, including its RGG box RNA binding domain, which is not essential for apoptosis prevention. Accumulations of viral TK, VP 16, and gD but not gC, ICP 22, or ICP 4 proteins correlated with prevention of apoptosis during the replication of these viruses. Of the nonapoptotic <b>viruses,</b> <b>d</b> 4 - 5 did not produce gC, indicating that accumulation of true late gene products is not necessary for the prevention process. Analyses of viral DNA synthesis in HEp- 2 cells indicated that apoptosis prevention by HSV- 1 requires that the infection proceeds to the stage in which viral DNA replication takes place. Infections performed {{in the presence of}} the drug phosphonoacetic acid confirmed that the process of viral DNA synthesis and the accumulation of true late (γ 2) proteins are not required for apoptosis prevention. Based on our results, we conclude that the accumulation of HSV- 1 early (β) and leaky-late (γ 1) proteins correlates with the prevention of apoptosis in infected HEp- 2 cells...|$|R
