5|$|Lewis (age 22) is from St Helens, Merseyside. Like Drew, he says <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> knowingly met another {{trans person}} before. He decided at age 18 to transition, {{and he has}} been living as a man for three years.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, Skarga {{became a}} {{character}} {{in a number of other}} artistic works, including a novel by Józef Ignacy Kraszewski, though <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been the chief character in any literary work longer than a poem.|$|E
5|$|He {{has pledged}} never {{to raise taxes}} and states <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> voted to approve a budget deficit. Paul {{believes}} that the country could abolish the individual income tax by scaling back federal spending to its fiscal year 2000 levels; financing government operations would be primarily by excise taxes and non-protectionist tariffs. He endorses eliminating most federal government agencies, terming them unnecessary bureaucracies.|$|E
60|$|She, Lydia Brangwen, {{was sorry}} for him now. <b>He</b> was dead--he <b>had</b> {{scarcely}} lived. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> known her. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> lain with her, but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> known her. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> received what she could give him. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> gone away from her empty. So, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> lived. So, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> died and passed away. Yet there had been strength and power in him.|$|R
6000|$|She waited, {{saying to}} herself that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> given her time, that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> asked her! And that, in truth, {{she did not}} know! ...|$|R
60|$|Jackman replied, with a laugh, that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> {{performed}} that curious {{operation on}} anything but socks--that, indeed, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> {{heard of such}} a thing being done.|$|R
5|$|Mitchell {{lives with}} his wife, Joyce, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; the couple have no children. Mitchell had {{expressed}} interest in becoming the head football coach at Alabama when that position had been open in the past. However, despite this interest and his connection with the program <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been pursued for the position.|$|E

5|$|At age seventy-seven, Barbree {{is one of}} the longest-serving network correspondents to work {{continuously}} on {{a single}} subject. He started working for NBC on July 21, 1958 covering the space program, and continues in that capacity to the present. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> missed a mission launch, despite suffering a heart attack while jogging along Cocoa Beach in 1987, and being declared clinically dead for several minutes. Following his heart attack, he had bypass surgery, and still did not miss any launches.|$|E
60|$|Mr Venus {{admitted}} that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> known those distinguished persons, and added, in effect, that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> {{so much as}} desired the honour of their acquaintance.|$|R
60|$|He {{was very}} well aware of it. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> asked her to write, and her note had seemed to him a trifle too ingenuous. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> meant to answer it.|$|R
60|$|Up to {{this time}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been loyalty itself, where his {{obligations}} lay--treachery {{was new to}} him; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> done an ignoble thing--baseness was new to him; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> done an unkind thing--that also was new to him.|$|R
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> {{been charged}} with any crime due to {{apparent}} mental inculpability. One contentious issue of Weston's incarceration is that of forced medication. Weston has thus far refused to take any medications voluntarily. His lawyers helped enable this, {{in order to protect}} him from the death penalty. In May 2001, a federal judge authorized doctors to treat Weston involuntarily. A panel from a federal appeals court ruled in July 2001 that Weston could be forced to take the drugs which he was forced to do for 120 days. He remains in the Butner facility indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Using {{alternating}} first-person perspectives, {{the novel}} tells {{the stories of}} Henry DeTamble (born 1963), a librarian at the Newberry Library in Chicago, and his wife, Clare Anne Abshire (born 1971), an artist who makes paper sculptures. Henry has a rare genetic disorder, which comes {{to be known as}} Chrono-Impairment, that causes him to involuntarily travel through time. When 20-year-old Clare meets 28-year-old Henry at the Newberry Library in 1991 {{at the opening of the}} novel, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> seen her before, although she has known him most of her life.|$|E
5|$|Willard Isenbaum, {{a lonely}} {{insurance}} man with wild sexual fantasies, decides to propose {{to the new}} secretary, Susie, whom he has only known {{for a day and}} to whom <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> spoken. He spends the entire morning before work fantasizing about having sex with her, but his attempts to approach her fail. His female boss sends him to investigate a claim filed by Painless Martha, an aging tattoo artist, who works in a prison. Martha believes in a Ouija board message saying that she will be killed by a wizard on a Tuesday.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> thought Edith half so {{beautiful}} before. Much as he admired the graces {{of her face}} and form, and freshly as they dwelt within his sensual remembrance, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> thought her half {{so beautiful}}.|$|R
60|$|He never remembered {{all that}} she said, but she made an {{impression}} that was almost despair upon him by her incidental mention of books that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> read, and of authors of whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> even heard.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her. There was a tone {{in her voice}} that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard before. There was a light in her eyes that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen in them before. Suddenly and {{fiercely}} he reached out his hand, and stopped her.|$|R
5|$|Flanagan {{observes that}} in Tenebrae, Argento offers two {{characters}} {{who suffer from}} impaired vision. Gianni (Christian Borromeo) is an eyewitness to an axe-murder, but the trauma of seeing the killing causes him to disregard a vital clue. Returning {{to the scene of}} the crime, he suddenly remembers everything, and is murdered before being able to tell anyone. Homicide detective Giermani reveals that he is a big fan of the novels of Agatha Christie, Mickey Spillane, Rex Stout, and Ed McBain, but admits that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been able to guess the identity of the killer in any of the books. He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet – he cannot see Peter Neal for what he really is.|$|E
5|$|Impa {{says that}} the mark on Link's hand means {{that he is the}} hero chosen to awaken Zelda. She gives Link a chest {{containing}} six crystals and ancient writings that only a great future king of Hyrule can read. Link finds that he can read the document, even though <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> seen the language before; it indicates that the crystals must be set into statues within six palaces scattered all over Hyrule. This will open the way to the Great Palace, which contains the Triforce of Courage. Only the power of the combined Triforces can awaken the enchanted Zelda. Taking the crystals, Link sets out to restore them to their palaces. Meanwhile, the followers of Ganon are seeking to kill Link, as sprinkling his blood on Ganon’s ashes will bring Ganon back to life.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous season the Giants headed into the 1985 season {{with a sense of}} optimism after their successful 1984 campaign and a 5–0 pre-season record. The Giants went 10–6, and Taylor spearheaded a defense that led the NFL in sacks with 68. Taylor had 13. One of the more memorable plays of his career occurred during this season. On a Monday Night Football game against the Redskins, Taylor's sack of Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann inadvertently resulted in a compound fracture of Theismann's right leg. After the sack, a distraught Taylor screamed for paramedics to attend to Theismann. Although this sack ended Theismann's career, Theismann has never blamed Taylor for the injury. Taylor says <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> seen video of the play and never wants to. During {{the first round of the}} playoffs, the Giants defeated the defending champion 49ers 17–3, but lost to the eventual champion Chicago Bears in the second round 21–0.|$|E
6000|$|... "I deny it. I utterly deny it," [...] said Eleanor, {{jumping from}} her seat and {{literally}} flashing before Mr. Arabin, as {{she stood on the}} drawing-room floor. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen her so excited, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen her look half so beautiful.|$|R
50|$|His {{manager at}} Ti-Raleigh, Peter Post, said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> always {{considered}} Van der Velde the son that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had.</b>|$|R
60|$|And all {{the time}} this fine, wise, Spartan Northland had been here, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> known. What puzzled him was, that, with such {{intrinsic}} fitness, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard the slightest calling whisper, had not himself gone forth to seek. But this, too, he solved in time.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Jaime {{talks with}} Edmure Tully, {{trying to win}} his {{cooperation}} by tempting him with seeing his newborn son, whom <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> seen, and offering to send {{him and his family}} to Casterly Rock, away from the Freys. Edmure ridicules Jaime and all of his past misdeeds, and asks him how he can live with himself. Jaime responds how he wants to take Riverrun to be back with Cersei, and he is willing to do anything to achieve it, even if it means killing every Tully he finds, including Edmure and his son. Jaime then sends Edmure to parley with the Blackfish. Despite the Blackfish's protests, the Tully soldiers allow Edmure entry into the castle. Edmure then orders his men to surrender Riverrun, and also orders the Blackfish's capture. The Blackfish helps Brienne and Podrick escape, but stays behind to fight to the end.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{manage to}} sneak in {{backstage}} at the concert, where Miley asks why they're here. Brian then explains that Stewie has a 'tumor' shaped like a football, which convinces Miley to let them hang out with her backstage. Miley and Stewie quickly become best friends and they sing a song which Stewie wrote. Soon, Chris realizes that the Monkey has {{spent more time with}} him, like taking him to play baseball and going to a father and son BBQ in Monkeykid. Chris then says to Peter that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> gave as much attention to him as the monkey has, so he grows to resent his own father. While having ice-cream with Miley, Stewie notices a signal interference on her cell phone when handing it to her. He then realises something is strange about Miley. Upon spying on her, Stewie and Brian discover that she is actually an android after seeing an employee insert a USB drive on the control panel on Miley's back. They both realized that Miley was created by Walt Disney Imagineering to become the perfect teen idol that can never fail. When Brian curiously asks if she can perform other tasks, Stewie agrees to reprogram Miley to have sex with Brian by gaining access to the control panel.

5|$|Copeland {{was born}} in Orangeville, Ontario, the son of Judy Copeland, a single parent who worked two jobs to support her son. To this day, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> met his father or seen a picture of him. He became {{interested}} in professional wrestling at a young age; his favorite wrestlers included Mr. Perfect, Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, Ricky Steamboat, Shawn Michaels, and Bret Hart. As a teenager, Copeland attended WrestleMania VI sitting in the eleventh row at ringside. He was cheering on WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan against The Ultimate Warrior, and he credits this match with making him realize {{he wanted to be}} a wrestler. When he was 17, he won an essay contest with his local gym, and his prize was free wrestling training with Sweet Daddy Siki and Ron Hutchison in Toronto. He put his wrestling aspirations aside to help pay the bills. He held numerous jobs and then attended Humber College, where he graduated with a degree in radio broadcasting, then received training.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kadaj and {{his colleagues}} are {{recruiting}} children infected with Geostigma. Denzel falls in with the group, attracted by their promises of a cure for the disease. Loz follows Tifa and Marlene to Aerith's church, where they had gone looking for Cloud, and attacks them. Tifa is knocked unconscious in the fight and Loz kidnapped Marlene. All the kidnapped children are taken to the ruins of the mystical Forgotten City, where Kadaj embraces them as brethren and announces his intention for them all to be reunited with Jenova. When Cloud arrives to rescue them, he is overpowered by Kadaj's gang, but is rescued by his old comrade Vincent Valentine. Demoralized by his failure, Cloud asks if sin can ever be truly forgiven, to which Vincent nonchalantly replies that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> tried to forgive. Cloud decides to keep fighting and returns to the city, where Kadaj has summoned Bahamut SIN and other monsters to terrorize the population. With the help of his companions from Final Fantasy VII, Cloud engages and defeats the monsters.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Ashley {{plays on}} the beach and builds sand castles. When Ashley's drunken mother phones, {{demanding}} to know where her son is, Uncle David feigns ignorance, telling her that he himself is not in Sheppey but in Manchester. Taking Ashley to an abandoned military bunker, he injects an unknown substance into his nephew's vein as they kiss. Ashley enters an altered state of consciousness, and David guides him back to the caravan as they smoke marijuana. Once there, David gives Ashley a second injection, as they sit and look out at the shore. After dark, David places his near-catatonic nephew in a dog bed, showing him a copy of a picture book titled Is Britain Great?. He proceeds to give him a third and final injection, which he remarks will make Ashley lose consciousness and suffer organ failure. As Ashley dies, David professes that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> loved anyone else as much before. The next morning, he goes onto the beach to place his nephew's body in a shallow grave, tearfully kissing the body goodbye before it is swept away by the sea.|$|E
