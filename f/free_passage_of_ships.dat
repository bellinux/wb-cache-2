5000|$|Raffles {{declared}} {{the foundation of}} what was to become modern Singapore on 6 February, securing the transfer of control of the island to the East India Company. With much pomp and ceremony, the official treaty was read aloud in languages representing all nations present, as well as the Malay and Chinese inhabitants. Hussein Shah was paid $5,000 a year while the local Temenggong received $3,000 a year, both massive sums at the time, equivalent to several hundred thousand dollars now. Farquhar was officially named the Resident of Singapore and Raffles was named as [...] "Agent to the Most Noble the Governor-General with the States of Rhio (Riau), Lingin and Johor". Although ownership of the post was to be exclusively British, explicit orders were given to Farquhar to maintain <b>free</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> through the Strait of Singapore and a small military presence was established alongside the trading post. After issuing orders to Farquhar and the remaining Europeans, Raffles left the next day, 7 February 1819.|$|E
50|$|This {{would not}} be the last time that the city of Haarlem got into an {{argument}} with the Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland. In 1514 a heavy storm broke the sluices and the dike at Spaarndam. Haarlem was happy to have the <b>free</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> and refused to repair the dike. When the Hof van Holland decided in favor of repairs, Haarlem asked to have the dam (and sluices with their tolls) moved closer to the city. This would mean that Haarlem would have the dam on its own property, and they would have more control. The heemraden voted against it, and repairs were ordered. In 1517 the dam was not yet ready and Haarlem sent soldiers to destroy the work underway. Again the Hof van Holland needed to mediate the heated tempers and again the decision was in favor of the Heemraden. Haarlem was allowed its own sluice gate for small ships, the Klein Haarlemmersluis, which kept working until 1897, when a new sluice was built. To manage the finances of building and maintaining the dam and all its sluices, it was decided to split the costs (and toll income) among the water boards downstream. Haarlem paid for its own sluice gate, and the Woerdersluis was paid for by the Water board called the Grootwaterschap Woerden, which also released its water overflow via the Spaarndam sluices.|$|E

While serving with the exercise force, Iowa crossed the Arctic Circle. In October, she took part in Baltic operations, and fired her phalanx guns, [...] guns, and [...] guns in the Baltic Sea on 17 October while operating with US and other allied ships. After these operations {{she returned to the}} United States.|$|R

5000|$|France became Israel's main arms {{supplier}} at {{this time}} and provided Israel with advanced military equipment and technology. This support was seen by Israel to counter the perceived threat from Egypt under President Gamal Abdel Nasser {{with respect to the}} [...] "Czech arms deal" [...] of September 1955. During the 1956 Suez Crisis, the Israeli Defense Forces invaded Egypt and were soon followed by French and British forces. For differing reasons, France, Israel and Britain colluded to topple Nasser by regaining control of the Suez Canal, following its nationalization, and to occupy parts of western Sinai assuring <b>free</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>shipping</b> in the Gulf of Aqaba. In response, the US, with support from Soviet Union at the UN intervened on behalf of Egypt to force a withdrawal. Afterward, Nasser expressed a desire to establish closer relations with the United States. Eager to increase its influence in the region, and prevent Nasser from going over to the Soviet Bloc, US policy was to remain neutral and not become too closely allied with Israel. At this time, the only assistance the US provided Israel was food aid. In the early 1960s, the US would begin to sell advanced, but defensive, weapons to Israel, Egypt, and Jordan, including Hawk anti-aircraft missiles.|$|R
50|$|The {{peace treaty}} between Egypt and Israel was signed 16 months after Egyptian {{president}} Anwar Sadat's visit to Israel in 1977 after intense negotiation. The main {{features of the}} treaty were mutual recognition, cessation {{of the state of}} war that had existed since the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, normalization of relations and the complete withdrawal by Israel of its armed forces and civilians from the Sinai Peninsula which Israel had captured during the Six-Day War in 1967. Egypt agreed to leave the area demilitarized. The agreement also provided for the <b>free</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> Israeli <b>ships</b> through the Suez Canal, and recognition of the Strait of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba as international waterways.|$|R
5|$|After {{the sudden}} and {{unexpected}} death of Carneiro Leão in September 1856, his cabinet only {{managed to survive}} him by a few months. The Emperor, although critical {{of the way the}} Conciliation had been implemented, had learned to appreciate its merits and was eager that it continue. PedroII's support gave the Conciliation another chance, and allowed Paranhos to return to government once more as Foreign Minister on 12 December 1858. The most pressing issue facing Paranhos was the Paraguayan government's persistent refusal to allow Brazilian ships access to Mato Grosso province. At that time, the best and fastest way to reach that distant Brazilian province was to travel via the Atlantic and from there up the rivers which flow between the nations south of Brazil. One of the reasons for Brazil's war against Argentina in 1851 was to assure the <b>free</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> its <b>ships.</b> The crisis between Brazil and Paraguay had dragged on since Paranhos's tenure as Foreign Minister in Carneiro Leão's cabinet. On 12 February 1858, Paranhos signed a treaty with Paraguay which allowed Brazilian <b>ships</b> unrestricted navigation <b>of</b> Paraguayan rivers. This prevented the outbreak of war—or at least deferred the conflict until 1864.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years {{the extent of}} sea-ice {{covering}} the North Pole has declined about 15 ∼ 20 % on average, and {{it is expected that}} by the end of the 21 st century, vast areas of the Arctic Ocean will be ice-free during the summer season, thus, increasing the possibility <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> navigation across the Arctic Ocean. In this paper, we have developed a model <b>of</b> <b>shipping</b> for the Northwest Passage (hereinafter NWP) in northern Canada to determine whether ice thinning will make this route more economically viable when compared with the Panama Canal. Among the 7 routes of the NWP, Route 2 and Route 3 offer better navigational conditions than the others. However, Route 3 has a depth limit of only 10 m, so here we use Route 2 which is suitable for deep draft navigation to carry on our analysis. Container <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> 4, 500 ∼ 15, 000 TEU under Hub and spoke mode, container shipping between Busan port and New York port is simulated for the Panama Canal and the NWP. This paper considers Canada's sovereignty in matters of navigation over the waters at the Arctic Archipelago, in the form of a toll fee for passage usage. We concluded that the NWP has an advantage over the Panama Canal if it is open for <b>free</b> international <b>passage,</b> regardless <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> size. However, if it is not free, its advantages depend on its toll fee. The lower the toll fee is, the more advantages the NWP will boast...|$|R
