50|$|Jumperless designs {{have the}} {{advantage}} that they are usually fast and easy to set up, often require little technical knowledge, and can be adjusted without having physical access to the circuit board. With PCs, the most common use of jumpers is in setting the operating mode for ATA <b>drives</b> (<b>master,</b> slave, or cable select), though this use is declining {{with the rise of}} SATA drives. Jumpers have been used since the beginning of printed circuit boards.|$|R

In KLT, it reveals the presence of macroscopic hetero-phase fluctuations and provides unique information on the nature and mechanism of the phase transition in relaxors.

After surviving on low sales {{for over a year}} and thanks to rising Mega Drive/Sonic The Hedgehog sales, the magazine circulation more than doubled during the end of 1991. The magazine enjoyed many successful years as one of the biggest selling Sega titles, covering consoles such as the Mega <b>Drive,</b> <b>Master</b> System, Game Gear, Mega-CD, Sega 32X and the Saturn.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the problem of}} global exponential synchronization for a class of memristor-based Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with time-varying discrete delays and unbounded distributed delays. The drive-response set is discussed. A novel controller is designed such that the response (slave) system can be controlled to synchronize with the <b>drive</b> (<b>master)</b> system. Through a nonlinear transformation, we get an alternative system from the considered memristor-based Cohen-Grossberg neural networks. By investigating the global exponential synchronization of the alternative system, we obtain the corresponding synchronization criteria of the considered memristor-based Cohen-Grossberg neural networks. Moreover, the conditions established in this paper are easy to be verified and improve the conditions derived in most of existing papers concerning stability and synchronization for memristor-based neural networks. Numerical simulations are given to show {{the effectiveness of the}} theoretical results...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The McTronX Research {{group at}} the North-West University is {{currently}} conducting research {{in the use of}} active magnetic bearings (AMBs) for a flywheel energy storage system (FESS). Together with this, the aim of this project is to take the level of control of such AMB systems to an industrial level. Instead of using a rapid prototype dSPACE® controller, a single board computer (SBC) is proposed. Issues to be addressed, includes: SBC overview, control system specifications, skills development for SBC, implementation and evaluation. All the digital and analogue input/output signal requirements for the FESS are determined prior to specifying an SBC. Six different SBCs were compared and in the end the SBC 6713 ell from Innovative Integration (II) was chosen and sourced. The SBC 6713 ell complies with all the requirements specified by the client. Two interface boards were used to integrate the SBC with the FESS. The first board contained all the protection circuitry to protect the controller from faults that could occur on the sensor and actuator side of the FESS and is used to connect the dSPACE® to the FESS without the SBC. After the hardware was integrated, the software/firmware integration started. On the SBC, the PD control was implemented for the AMBs as well as the voltage over frequency control for the PMSM. A graphical user interface (GUI) was further developed on a host computer to monitor the FESS. Four tests were done on the integration of the SBC with the FESS. Firstly the performance of the controller with regard to the control algorithms was tested. The stability and sensitivity analyses of the system followed and ended with the PMSM start-up test. The control algorithm execution time was longer than expected and adjustments to the sampling time had to be made. Stability tests showed a decrease in bearing stiffness and damping, which was due to low pass filters on the analogue to digital converter board. The sensitivity of the system also increased due to the effect of the filters on the system. The inconsistency in bearing damping and stiffness, obtained from the stability tests was verified by adding the filters to the simulation. These filters caused an attenuation of less than 1 dB, but resulted in a phase shift of - 36. 3 ° in the control loop. Industrial control was realised using an SBC, but further work is still necessary. The areas identified for future work is: non linear control algorithms, low noise digital power amplifiers, speed sensor and the PMSM <b>drive.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a class of}} stochastic processes modeling binary interactions in an N-particle system. Examples of such systems {{can be found in}} the modeling of biological swarms. They lead to the definition of a class of master equations that we call pair interaction <b>driven</b> <b>master</b> equations. We prove a propagation of chaos result for this class of master equations which generalizes Mark Kac's well know result for the Kac model in kinetic theory. We use this result to study kinetic limits for two biological swarm models. We show that propagation of chaos may be lost at large times and we exhibit an example where the invariant density is not chaotic...|$|R
