60|$|This text {{seems to}} insinuate that Christ is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holiest</b> or highest heavens alone; {{and that he}} there alone must be, until he has {{finished}} his work of intercession; for not till then he comes again {{to take us to}} himself. Let us grant Christ <b>the</b> pre-eminency <b>in</b> this, as also in all other things; for he is intercessor for his church, and makes it for them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holiest</b> alone.

5|$|In Christian theology, baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit (also called baptism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Spirit or Spirit baptism) is {{distinguished}} from baptism with water.

5|$|Joseph {{understood}} {{the problems facing}} his multi-ethnic patrimony and the ambivalent position the Austrians held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Roman Empire. Although the Habsburgs and their successor house of Habsburg-Lorraine had, with two exceptions, held the position of Emperor since the early 15th century, the basis of 18th-century Habsburg power lay not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Roman Empire itself, but in Habsburg territories in Eastern Europe (where the family had vast domains), the Italian peninsula, and the Lowlands. For Joseph or his successors to wield influence in the German-speaking states, they needed to acquire additional German-speaking territories. Acquisition of Central European territories with German-speaking subjects would strengthen the Austrian position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Roman Empire. As far as Joseph was concerned, only this could shift {{the center of the}} Habsburg empire into German-speaking Central Europe. This agenda made dispensable both the Austrian Netherlands—Habsburg territories which lay furthest west—and Galicia, furthest east. It also made the recovery of German-speaking Silesia and acquisition of new territories in Bavaria essential.|$|E

5|$|Baptism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Spirit occurs {{elsewhere}} in Acts. The gospel had been proclaimed in Samaria and the apostles Peter and John were sent from Jerusalem.

The Apostle Paul was also filled with the Holy Spirit when Ananias of Damascus laid hands on him, and afterwards Paul was baptized with water.|$|E
5|$|Bucer {{believed}} that the Catholics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Roman Empire could be convinced to join the Reformation. Through a series of conferences organised by Charles V, he tried to unite Protestants and Catholics to create a German national church separate from Rome. He did not achieve this, as political events led to the Schmalkaldic War and the retreat of Protestantism within the Empire. In 1548, Bucer was persuaded, under duress, to sign the Augsburg Interim, which imposed certain forms of Catholic worship. However, he continued to promote reforms until the city of Strasbourg accepted the Interim, and forced him to leave.|$|E
