[...] Specifically <b>for</b> <b>Alzheimer</b> Disease patients, the activity of Oxoglutarate dehydrogenase is significantly diminished. [...] This leads to a possibility that the portion of the TCA cycle responsible for causing the build-up of free radical species in the brain of patients is a malfunctioning Oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. The mechanism for disease-related inhibition of this enzyme complex remains relatively unknown.|$|E
