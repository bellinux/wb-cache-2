5000|$|The French typographic point, the <b>Didot</b> <b>point,</b> was [...] French inch, i.e. two royal points. The French pica, called Cicéro, {{measured}} 12 Didot points.|$|E
5000|$|The French pica of 12 <b>Didot</b> <b>points</b> (also called cicéro) {{generally}} is: 12 × 0.376 = 4.512 mm.|$|R
5000|$|... 1 cicero = 12 <b>Didot</b> <b>points</b> = 1⁄6 French Royal inch = 62 500⁄13 853 mm ≤ [...] 4.511 658 124 6 mm, also in {{practice}} mostly: 4.512 000 mm, i.e. + 0.0076%.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} Chinese font sizes use American points; the Continental systems {{traditionally}} used the Fournier or <b>Didot</b> <b>points.</b> The Fournier points, being smaller than Didot's, {{were associated with}} the names of the Didot type closest in size rather than identical in number of points.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Didot</b> <b>point</b> {{established}} by François-Ambroise Didot in 1770. [...] was twice Truchet's and thus [...] {{of the royal}} foot, i.e. by 1799 mm or ca[...]|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Didot</b> <b>point</b> {{system has}} been widely used in European countries. An {{abbreviation}} for it that these countries use is [...] "dd", employing an old method for indicating plurals. Hence [...] "12 dd" [...] means twelve didot points.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of phototypesetting in the 1970s metric units were increasingly used in typography. The <b>Didot</b> <b>point</b> was redefined once again to 375 μm exactly ( [...] mm). Furthermore a new unit, the quart (quarter millimetre, abbreviated ‘q’) of 250 μm ( [...] mm) was devised.|$|E
5000|$|Approximations were {{subsequently}} employed, largely {{owing to the}} <b>Didot</b> <b>point's</b> unwieldy conversion to metric units. (The divisor of its conversion ratio has the prime factorization of [...]) Values included Hermann Berthold's 376 µm point and Jan Tschichold's [...] (266 points to 100 mm). Due to the definition in TeX of 1157 dd = 1238 pt, the slightly larger [...] became a common value.|$|R
5000|$|It is [...] of the {{historical}} French inch, and is divided into 12 points, known in English as French <b>points</b> or <b>Didot</b> <b>points.</b> The unit of the cicero is similar to an English pica, although the French inch was slightly larger than the English inch. There are about 1.063 picas to a cicero; a pica is 4.23333333 mm and a cicero is 4.5 mm.|$|R
5000|$|Didot's new {{measuring}} scale was divided in 288 typographic points, {{instead of the}} former 144, and described 12 type sizes, instead of the 20 or 22 listed by Fournier the young. As many of the sizes kept their names, but changed their dimensions, a great confusion ensued among printers, {{and some of them}} campaigned for a return to the older system. Nevertheless, the <b>Didot</b> <b>points</b> were progressively adopted until becoming the norm. This way of measuring type based in the mediaeval royal units prevailed even after the French Revolution, when the metric system was adopted by France.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, the <b>Didot</b> <b>point</b> {{system was}} created by François-Ambroise Didot (1730-1804) in c. 1783. Didot's system was based on Pierre Simon Fournier's (1712-1768), but Didot {{modified}} Fournier's by adjusting the base unit precisely to a French Royal inch (pouce), as Fournier's unit {{was based on a}} less common foot.|$|E
5000|$|Metric typographic {{units have}} been devised and {{proposed}} several times to overcome the various traditional point systems. After the French revolution of 1789 one popular proponent of a switch to metric was Didot, who {{had been able to}} standardise the continental European typographic measurement a few decades earlier. The conversion did not happen, though. The <b>Didot</b> <b>point</b> was metrically redefined as [...] m in 1879 by Berthold.|$|E
50|$|TeX also {{supports}} a new <b>Didot</b> <b>point</b> (nd) at mm or 375 µm, and cites a 1978 redefinition for it. The French National Print Office adopted {{a point of}} mm or 400 µm exactly and continues to use this measurement today. Japanese and German standardization bodies instead opted for a metric typographic base measure of exactly mm or 250 µm. It is called Q in Japanese after the initial letter of quarter millimetre. Due to demand by Japanese typesetters, CSS adopted Q in 2015.|$|E

5000|$|... {{12 point}} Founier equaled 11 <b>point</b> <b>Didot,</b> {{because of this}} the Fournier system was later called [...] "median-system". This name [...] "median" [...] was used for type at 11 point.|$|R
5000|$|About 1780 François-Ambroise <b>Didot</b> {{adapted the}} <b>point</b> system for sizing typefaces by width, using units of 1/72 of the pre-metric French inch. His [...] "point", later named the didot after him, became the {{prevailing}} unit of type measurement throughout continental Europe and its former colonies, including Latin America. In 1973 it was metrically standardized at 0.375 mm for the European Union. (Meanwhile, the English-speaking world adopted a [...] "point" [...] based on 1/72 {{of the smaller}} English inch.) ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1723, the French {{government}} {{agreed that}} types should {{be subject to}} standards. By 1737, the younger Fournier decided to begin creating his punches to a scale of 6 ciceros or 72 points to the Paris inch, instead of the then-standard height-to-paper method. This point is smaller than the subsequent <b>Didot</b> <b>point</b> established by François-Ambroise Didot 38 years later, as Fournier used the Paris foot (0.298 m) and Didot used the royal foot ( [...] , 0.325 m). The Fournier cicero (12 points) is approximately 11 Didot points.|$|E
50|$|The use in {{typography}} of the point, {{which was}} one twelfth of a ligne in the customary French measures of the Ancien Régime, as a unit for measuring print type predates the metric system. Various typographic points were defined, including the Truchet point by Sébastien Truchet (1657-1729), the Fournier point by Pierre Simon Fournier in 1737 and the <b>Didot</b> <b>point</b> by the Didot brothers, Francois Ambroise and Pierre Francois, in 1755 or 1767 or 1783, which was exactly two Truchet points. The point was first used in the United States in 1878 or 1872 by a Chicago type foundry (Marder, Luse, & Co.).|$|E
50|$|In Germany, the French typographic {{point system}} was never {{properly}} implemented, {{which resulted in}} a wide variability of dimensions for type metal. In order to try to solve this situation, in 1879, German and Prussian printer and businessman Hermann Berthold proposed his own system to standardise typographic points based on the metric system For that purpose, he divided a meter in 2660 identical typographic points. This measure, which is 0,0076 % wider than the <b>Didot</b> <b>point,</b> became the current reference for printing. From 1897 on, German manufacturer A. W. Faber started commercialising sliding rulers that allowed typographers to calculate in a simple manner the measures of their layouts.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the basic}} idea of the point system - to {{generate}} different type sizes by multiplying a single minimum unit calculated by dividing a base measurement unit such as one French Royal inch - was not Didot's invention, but Fournier's. In Fournier's system, an approximate French Royal inch (pouce) is divided by 12 to calculate 1 ligne, which is then divided by 6 to get 1 <b>point.</b> <b>Didot</b> just made the base unit (one French Royal inch) identical to the standard value defined by the government.|$|R
40|$|Nine Solaces’ is {{hand-set}} {{and printed}} in rare Stempel Foundry types: 12 point Optima and 28 <b>point</b> <b>Didot</b> Sabon. The piece is printed {{in black and}} red on Zerkall mould-made papers and hand-sewn into an eight page cover printed with black woodletter (9 | S). The fnished size is 30 picas by 36 picas. It consists of a 12 page text exploring the historical printing house custom of collecting solaces (fnes) imposed on workmen who break working practice rules. The text is extracted from William Savage’s Dictionary of the Art of Printing, London, 1841. These rules for those who breach {{the laws of the}} ‘chapel’ are arranged in sequential order and denoted through a progression of solid pica squares printed in the red. Each rule is accompanied by a short text describing the nature of each law or rule, fnes imposed and subsequent punishment for those who ‘break the laws of the chapel’. A listing of the monetary value (circa. 1800) is given on the colophon page for each class of workman. The text was also used as the basis for a student letterpress project exploring the historical nature of traditional printing trade practices and customs. At their own instigation, the students re-installed some of these solaces in a contemporary setting during their time in the letterpress workshop sessions...|$|R
