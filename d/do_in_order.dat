5|$|The Bulgarian monarch was {{satisfied}} with the results and considered that he had superiority over the Byzantine Empire to achieve his political ambitions— to assume the throne in Constantinople. Despite the success, however, Simeon I {{realized that there was}} still a lot to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to prevail over the Empire for good. He needed his own political and ideological base and launched an ambitious construction programme in Preslav so that it could rival Constantinople. In addition, Simeon I took precautions to reduce the Byzantine influence over the Western Balkans by imposing his authority over the Principality of Serbia in return for recognizing Petar Gojniković as its ruler.|$|E
5|$|The global {{nature of}} the war meant that many {{functions}} that were previously vested in the individual Australian state governments had to be placed {{under the control of}} the Commonwealth government. Additionally, the exigencies of the war meant that the government required the power to enact certain laws that under the Constitution it would not normally be able to <b>do.</b> <b>In</b> <b>order</b> to enable this to occur, the War Precautions Act 1914 was introduced in October 1914, providing the Commonwealth government with wide-ranging powers for a period of up to six months after the duration of the war.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton assumed {{control in}} the War department, and the rift between Adams' and Hamilton's {{supporters}} widened. Many sought to vest Hamilton with command authority over the army, and they also resisted giving prominent Democratic-Republicans positions in the army, which Adams wanted to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to gain bipartisan support. By building a large standing army, Hamilton's supporters raised popular alarms and played {{into the hands of}} the Democratic-Republicans. They also alienated Adams and his large personal following. They shortsightedly viewed the Federalist party as their own tool and ignored the need to pull together the entire nation in the face of war with France. Overall, however, patriotic sentiments and a series of naval victories, popularized the war as well as the president.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the {{evaporator}} and condenser heat exchangers is also {{very important to the}} overall efficiency of the heat pump. The heat exchange surface areas and the corresponding temperature differential (between the refrigerant and the air stream) directly affect the operating pressures and hence the work the compressor has to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to provide the same heating or cooling effect. Generally, the larger the heat exchanger, the lower the temperature differential and the more efficient the system becomes.|$|E
25|$|Currently most of {{the nuclear}} power {{stations}} must operate below the temperatures and pressures that coal-fired plants <b>do,</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to provide more conservative safety margins within the systems that remove heat from the nuclear fuel rods. This, in turn, limits their thermodynamic efficiency to 30–32%. Some advanced reactor designs being studied, such as the very high temperature reactor, advanced gas-cooled reactor and supercritical water reactor, would operate at temperatures and pressures similar to current coal plants, producing comparable thermodynamic efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Armenia {{was spared}} the devastation and {{destruction}} that wrought {{most of the}} western Soviet Union during the Great Patriotic War of World War II. The Nazis never reached the South Caucasus, which they intended to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to capture the oil fields in Azerbaijan. Still, Armenia played a valuable role in aiding the allies both through industry and agriculture. An estimated 300–500,000 Armenians served in the war, almost half of whom did not return. Armenia thus {{had one of the}} highest death tolls, per capita, among the other Soviet republics.|$|E

25|$|Leonardo's face is {{best known}} from a drawing in red chalk {{that appears to be}} a self-portrait. However, there is some {{controversy}} over the identity of the subject, because the man represented appears to be of a greater age than the 67 years lived by Leonardo. A solution which has been put forward is that Leonardo deliberately aged himself in the drawing, as a modern forensic artist might <b>do,</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to provide a model for Raphael's painting of him as Plato in The School of Athens.|$|E
25|$|Although artisanal logging {{provides}} some {{income for the}} community in the short-run, it ultimately does not improve local living conditions. In the end, the communities receive payments which are not large {{enough to cover the}} loss of their natural resources. Since there is no monitoring mechanism, the loggers report lower harvested amounts than they actually <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to pay less tax to the local government. Some loggers cut one tree within the woods and leave the rest intact to mimic natural disturbance. To improve the situation, the DRC government needs better monitoring and better forest code to manage the logging activities.|$|E
25|$|Reinforcement {{learning}} is a third branch of machine learning, distinct from supervised and unsupervised learning, which also admits quantum enhancements. In quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning, a quantum agent interacts with a classical environment and occasionally receives rewards for its actions, which allows the agent to adapt its behaviour—in other words, to learn what to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to gain more rewards. In some situations, either because of the quantum processing capability of the agent, or due to the possibility to probe the environment in superpositions, a quantum speedup may be achieved. Implementations {{of these kinds of}} protocols in superconducting circuits and in systems of trapped ions have been proposed.|$|E

25|$|An average {{domestic}} worker {{can earn}} {{as much as}} $100 a month, despite the little income; the workers send back the money to their countries. This they <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to help their families whom {{are in need of}} the money, but another direct result of this remittance process is the contribution these workers provide to their country of origin and their economy. In 2008, the Philippines had 13% of its GDP a direct result of foreign remittances sweeping in the country. Sri Lanka, another major workforce contributing state received in 2007 3.4 billion dollars in remittance and the entire Sub-Saharan Africa region has received 7 billion dollars from workers returning money they have earned.|$|E
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} to {{passive immunity}} is that producing antibodies {{in a laboratory}} is expensive and difficult to <b>do.</b> <b>In</b> <b>order</b> to produce antibodies for infectious diseases, {{there is a need}} for possibly thousands of human donors to donate blood or immune animals' blood would be obtained for the antibodies. Patients who are immunized with the antibodies from animals may develop serum sickness due to the proteins from the immune animal and develop serious allergic reactions. Antibody treatments can be time consuming and are given through an intravenous injection or IV, while a vaccine shot or jab is less time consuming and has less risk of complication than an antibody treatment. Passive immunity is effective, but ephemeral (lasting a short amount of time).|$|E
25|$|The highest {{civilization and}} culture, {{apart from the}} ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found {{exclusively}} among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All {{this is due to}} the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.|$|E

500|$|Katy Hudson was {{released}} on February 8, 2001. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic awarded the record three stars out of five, stating that with the album, Hudson had [...] "betray a heavy, heavy debt to Alanis Morissette". Erlewine also interpreted some of the songs' lyrics as having sexual overtones, and identifying those as [...] "the most interesting things" [...] in the album, describing the record's overall sound as [...] "the kind of assaultive, over-produced Wall of Sound that some CCM rockers <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to prove they're contemporary".|$|E

[...] Jagger said, [...] "We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought {{it was a bit of}} a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us." ...|$|E

[...] In November 2003, Franken talked about moving back to his home state of Minnesota to run for the Senate. At the time the seat, once held by Wellstone, was occupied by Republican Norm Coleman. At a 2004 Democratic presidential campaign event, Franken tackled a man who was allegedly threatening other attendees and heckling Governor Howard Dean. [...] In 2005, Franken announced his move to Minnesota: [...] "I can tell you honestly, I don't know if I'm going to run, but I'm doing the stuff I need to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to do it." [...] In late 2005, Franken started his own political action committee, called Midwest Values PAC. By early 2007, the PAC raised more than $1 million.|$|E

The Wehrmacht never reached the South Caucasus, which they intended to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to capture the oil fields in Azerbaijan. Still, Armenia played a valuable role {{in the war in}} providing food, manpower and war matériel. An estimated 300–500,000 Armenians served in the war, almost half of whom did not return. Many attained the highest rank of Hero of the Soviet Union. Over sixty Armenians were promoted to the rank of general, and with an additional four eventually achieving the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union: Ivan Bagramyan (the first non-Slavic commander to hold the position of front commander when he was assigned to be the commander of the First Baltic Front in 1943), Admiral Ivan Isakov, Hamazasp Babadzhanian, and Sergei Khudyakov. The Soviet government, in an effort to shore up popular [...] support for the war, also allowed for token expressions of nationalism with the re-publication of Armenian novels, the production of films such as David Bek (1944), and the easing of restrictions placed against the Church. Stalin temporarily relented his attacks on religion during the war. This led to the election of bishop Gevork in 1945 as new Catholicos Gevork VI. He was subsequently allowed to reside in Echmiatsin.|$|E
500|$|... "The Xindi" [...] {{was seen}} as a new pilot by {{executive}} producers Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, who also wrote the episode. Braga said [...] "We were re-establishing an Enterprise {{that was going to be}} a little bit different this year, so we had to think of it in those terms." [...] They felt the best way to do this was to immediately reveal the Xindi to the audience, and to give the MACOs something to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to introduce them as well. He called it a [...] "big episode" [...] as they sought to set up the rest of season. The shoot began on June 26, 2003, with the expectation that it would take nine days (as opposed to the usual seven) to complete. One of the special effects on the episode used ground Styrofoam which had been painted blue and processed through a wood chipper. It was used to represent the mineral Trellium-D within the mine. However, the ground Styrofoam stuck to the actors' shoes and costumes and ended up being spread throughout the Paramount lot where the series was filmed. It would turn up in unexpected places on set for the rest of the series, and was found in among the sets as they were being dismantled after the end of [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} {{originally planned}} {{to add a}} feature that would allow players to craft weapons, but the idea was ultimately discarded. According to Hope, [...] "We thought about what people would want to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to survive. We explored different ideas, {{and one of them}} was fashioning weapons to defend yourself. That was quite early on, but then we realised that this game isn't really about pulling the trigger." [...] Another cancelled feature was the alien's iconic acid blood as a game mechanic, which could melt through metal like in the film. Although the feature was implemented at one point, it was eventually removed from the game because the developers felt it would change the course of the game in a [...] "weird" [...] direction. In addition, the developers considered the possibility for the game to be played from a third-person perspective, but then realised that it would significantly change the experience. Hope explained that it would become [...] "a game about jockeying the camera and looking after your avatar. But in first-person it's you that's being hunted. If you're hiding behind an object and you want to get a better view of your surroundings, you have to move." [...] The actual development of the game took overall four years to complete after the Creative Assembly first pitched the idea to Sega. The game went gold on 9 September 2014 and is dedicated to Simon Franco, a programmer of the game, who died during its development.|$|E
