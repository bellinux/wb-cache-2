5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries, Great Britain and France had a {{territorial}} dispute over Saint Lucia.

5|$|Although {{the most}} {{damaging}} tornado of the outbreak sequence occurred in Greensburg on the 4th, twenty-five tornadoes were confirmed that day. That number exploded to 84 the following day (May 5th), with many tornadoes near the affected area from the previous night. Most were in open country, but there were injuries {{in at least two}} spots in Kansas, and one death reported near a county lake in Ottawa County. 14 more tornadoes were confirmed on May 6th in the region before the outbreak <b>finally</b> <b>ended.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{key figure}} in Skagen, P.S. Krøyer, married Marie Triepcke after {{falling in love with}} her in Paris in 1888. The {{daughter}} of a prosperous German loomery engineer, she was said to be {{the most beautiful woman in}} Copenhagen. However, as the years went by, Krøyer's health began to deteriorate and Marie was increasingly unhappy with their marriage. The marriage <b>finally</b> <b>ended</b> in a divorce in 1905 when Marie became pregnant after an affair with the composer Hugo Alfvén whom she then married. Krøyer died in Skagen four years later, apparently as a result of mental illness.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz {{appointed}} Fabio Capello as coach. Although {{his tenure}} lasted only one season, Real Madrid was proclaimed league champion and players like Roberto Carlos, Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker and Clarence Seedorf {{arrived at the}} club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro, Iván Zamorano, and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) <b>finally</b> <b>ended</b> its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Predrag Mijatović.|$|E
5|$|In Mackay's account, the panicked tulip speculators {{sought help}} from the {{government}} of the Netherlands, which responded by declaring that anyone who had bought contracts to purchase bulbs in the future could void their contract by payment of a 10 percent fee. Attempts were made to resolve the situation to the satisfaction of all parties, but these were unsuccessful. The mania <b>finally</b> <b>ended,</b> Mackay says, with individuals stuck with the bulbs they held {{at the end of the}} crash—no court would enforce payment of a contract, since judges regarded the debts as contracted through gambling, and thus not enforceable by law.|$|E
5|$|In a 1983 study, R. J. Kaufmann {{suggests}} that Shaw {{was a key}} forerunner—"godfather, if not actually finicky paterfamilias"—of the Theatre of the Absurd. Two further aspects of Shaw's theatrical legacy are noted by Crawford: his opposition to stage censorship, which was <b>finally</b> <b>ended</b> in 1968, and his efforts which extended over many years to establish a National Theatre. Shaw's short 1910 play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets, in which Shakespeare pleads with Queen Elizabeth I for the endowment of a state theatre, was part of this campaign.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, federal {{prosecutors}} such as Eugene Reese attempted to prosecute responsible parties under federal laws against debt peonage. But such efforts received little support nationally and {{none in the}} South, which had disenfranchised most blacks to exclude them from the political system. Northern attention was focused on immigration and World War I. The convict lease system <b>finally</b> <b>ended</b> {{with the advent of}} World War II. National and presidential attention was focused on racial issues because of the need for national unity and mobilization of the military.|$|E
5|$|Laffoon {{responded to}} the {{economic}} crisis by declaring a four-day banking holiday to begin on March 1, 1933. He twice extended the holiday, which <b>finally</b> <b>ended</b> on March 18. Responding to complaints of low prices by farmers, he closed burley tobacco markets in December of that year. At {{the end of the}} 1932 fiscal year, figures showed that the state incurred a $2 million deficit. Kentucky was also unable to secure significant financial assistance under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal because the state was often unable to raise the required matching funds.|$|E
5|$|After Argentina's {{unsuccessful}} {{performance in}} the Copa América, Batista was replaced by Alejandro Sabella. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain Javier Mascherano. Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil {{the role of the}} team's on-field leader and motivator. In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games. Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi <b>finally</b> <b>ended</b> his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against Chile on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years.|$|E

5|$|Armstrong {{announced}} {{his intention to}} retire as a player following the championship but {{changed his mind and}} returned for another season. The Maple Leafs placed him on their protected list for the 1967 Expansion Draft, and he remained with Toronto. He played in his seventh All-Star Game in 1968 and finished the season with 34 points. Retiring following the season before changing his mind became an annual event for Armstrong as he {{announced his}} intention to leave the game in five straight years. He remained a consistent scorer for Toronto, recording 27, 28 and 25 points in his following three seasons. He <b>finally</b> <b>ended</b> his playing career after the 1970–71 season to take an office position in the Maple Leafs., and also he finished his career with two hundred and ninety-six goals, four goals away from obtaining three hundred.|$|E
5|$|Operation Overlord <b>finally</b> <b>ended</b> on 14 June and 1 ATF {{returned}} to Nui Dat. Overall, despite the heavy contact experienced early on, it had yielded little for the Australians although neither D445 or 33 NVA Regiment were encountered in Phuoc Tuy again. Overlord {{was one of}} the larger task force operations of the war, while it was also the last joint US-Australian battalion-sized operation. Indeed, although the fighting continued, Australian operations began to wind down. On 18 August 1971, Prime Minister William McMahon announced that 1 ATF would cease operations in October, commencing a phased withdrawal. Ultimately, the last Australian forces were withdrawn from Vietnam by 1973.|$|E
5|$|The Empire {{recovered}} {{again during}} the Komnenian restoration, such that by the 12th century Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest European city. However, it was delivered a mortal blow during the Fourth Crusade, when Constantinople was sacked in 1204 and the territories that the Empire formerly governed were divided into competing Byzantine Greek and Latin realms. Despite the eventual recovery of Constantinople in 1261, the Byzantine Empire remained {{only one of several}} small rival states in the area for the final two centuries of its existence. Its remaining territories were progressively annexed by the Ottomans over the 15th century. The Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 <b>finally</b> <b>ended</b> the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
