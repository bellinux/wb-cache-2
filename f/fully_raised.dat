5|$|Initially the new {{regiment}} {{was equipped}} with Churchill tanks, although this was only a temporary measure until Centurion tanks could be acquired. However, due to the perceived unsuitability of the Churchill and the late arrival of the new platform, the regiment was not deployed as part of Australia's commitment to the Korean War, although a number of officers served on exchange with British and US formations and the unit provided machine-gunners and signalers to Australian infantry battalions as reinforcements. The first Centurions finally began arriving in June 1952, with the regiment receiving 39 tanks. With the numbers of regular personnel steadily growing, {{it was possible to}} raise Regimental Headquarters, Headquarters Squadron and B Squadron, and the regiment was <b>fully</b> <b>raised</b> by 8 September 1952 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Graham.|$|E

25|$|In the 2010 Winter Olympics at Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, athletes Catriona Le May Doan, Steve Nash, Nancy Greene and Wayne Gretzky were to {{simultaneously}} light {{the base of}} poles, which would then carry the flames upwards to the cauldron. However, only {{three out of four}} poles came out of the ground due to mechanical problems, resulting in inadvertently excluding Le May Doan from lighting it with the other three athletes. Because the site of the ceremonies - BC Place - was a domed stadium, Gretzky was sent via the back of a pick-up truck to a secondary site— the Vancouver Convention Centre which served at the International Broadcast Centre for these Olympics— to light a larger cauldron of a similar design located outdoors, as Olympic rules state that the flame must be in public view for the entirety of the Olympics. In the closing ceremonies, Le May Doan took part in a joke about the mechanical glitch, and she was able to light the <b>fully</b> <b>raised</b> fourth pole and have the indoor cauldron relit.|$|E

500|$|Whereas {{competitors}} in the first series of Robot Wars had largely featured passive weapons, the second series saw {{a greater number of}} robots—including the series champion, Panic Attack—using lifting and flipping weapons designed to overturn an opponent. Lewis and Scott noted that when Razer was overturned with its piercing arm fully upright, the robot was more than halfway towards naturally rolling back onto its wheels. Therefore, rather than equipping Razer with a powered mechanism for righting itself when inverted, two wings were attached to the arm. Tensioned via cables, the wings opened when the arm was <b>fully</b> <b>raised,</b> levering Razer back onto its wheels. The unique design provided Razer with a [...] "victory salute"—raising its claw and wings whilst standing on its tail—but had the downside of putting the machine over the weight limit of [...]|$|E
500|$|In 1867, {{prison labour}} from Adelaide Gaol {{was used to}} build a wooden dam {{near the site of}} the current weir. The dam was poorly {{constructed}} and almost immediately the Torrens washed it away. Construction of a permanent concrete weir was begun in November 1880 and completed, at a cost of £7,000, in 1881. The sluice gates were closed to begin filling the [...] Torrens Lake on 1 July 1881. At the lake's official opening on 21 July 1881 an estimated 40,000, almost the entire population of Adelaide, attended. During the 1889 flood, the weir was overwhelmed, its gates jammed, and in trying to free them the weir's designer John Langdon was crippled. The weir was rebuilt from 1928 to 1929 with its footbridge relocated and the centre section replaced. The gates can now be <b>fully</b> <b>raised</b> and the river allowed to flow unimpeded.|$|E

50|$|In 1976, {{to control}} the induced camera {{vibrations}} caused by the upward movement of the large mirror to a sudden stop, a mirror release mechanism was introduced. By sliding upwards the mirror-up switch on the right hand side of the mirror housing, it allowed a bypass of the mirror release from the shutter trip cycle. This allowed the mirror to <b>fully</b> <b>raise</b> and then hold, allowing then the shutter release cycle still be at the ready. Unfortunately, this also activated the main power switch that was mechanically tied to the mirrors' main gear action and until the depressing of the shutter release to completes the exposure, the power to the circuits remain on and would drain the battery over time. Even with this one negative aspect to the Mirror-Lock-Up modification, it would still become a standard feature in later productions.|$|R

2500|$|Built in 1930, and {{considered}} the architectural centerpiece of the district, the neoclassical building is named for the university's second president Dr. James B. Dudley. The Dudley Building was designed by noted North Carolina architect Charles C. Hartmann, this building was erected {{on the site of}} the former Administrative building, which was built in 1893 and destroyed by fire in 1930. The building originally housed the college's administrative offices, in addition to an auditorium and library on the main and top levels respectively. Today the Dudley building houses the University art galleries on the main floor. The 29,058 square foot building features 2 floors in addition to a <b>fully</b> <b>raised</b> basement level. A distinctive feature of this building is its use of stone. This building features more stone application than any other building on the university's campus. The building also features a broad sweep of fifteen steeps to the main entrance, smooth-face blocks defining a five-bay entrance, intricately carved lintels and acroteria, full classical entablature, splayed arches with keystones over the eight-over-twelve sash windows, and a hexastyle portico with an incised frieze. The building's interior remains unaltered as the original plaster walls and molded door and window surrounds [...] still remain. The exterior of the building has been virtually unchanged with the exception of the entrance doors, which are now made of double-leaf metal trimmed plate glass.|$|E
60|$|The Queen's purveyors {{had been}} abroad, {{sweeping}} the farms and villages of those articles usually exacted during a royal Progress, {{and for which}} the owners were afterwards to obtain a tardy payment from the Board of Green Cloth. The Earl of Leicester's household officers had been scouring {{the country for the}} same purpose; and many of his friends and allies, both near and remote, took this opportunity of ingratiating themselves by sending large quantities of provisions and delicacies of all kinds, with game in huge numbers, and whole tuns of the best liquors, foreign and domestic. Thus the highroads were filled with droves of bullocks, sheep, calves, and hogs, and choked with loaded wains, whose axle-trees cracked under their burdens of wine-casks and hogsheads of ale, and huge hampers of grocery goods, and slaughtered game, and salted provisions, and sacks of flour. Perpetual stoppages took place as these wains became entangled; and their rude drivers, swearing and brawling till their wild passions were <b>fully</b> <b>raised,</b> began to debate precedence with their wagon-whips and quarterstaves, which occasional riots were usually quieted by a purveyor, deputy-marshal's man, or some other person in authority, breaking the heads of both parties.|$|E

5000|$|The first drummers {{who started}} open-handed playing are musicians like Billy Cobham, Lenny White, and Dennis Wilson, who started {{this way of}} playing in the 1960s and early 1970s either out of {{instinct}} (such as Wilson, who was naturally left-handed and therefore felt more comfortable leading with that hand), or out of experimentation, finding the advantage of not having to cross one's hands over in complex fills or playing the hi-hats in the traditional manner. Many proponents of the technique have {{also noted that the}} lack of a [...] "roof" [...] of another arm crossing over allows for the full range of the snare playing arm's stroke to be available, meaning that loud rimshots are more easily played. Others have pointed out the added conservation of energy attained by not having to <b>fully</b> <b>raise</b> and cross one's lead hand when playing, for instance, between the hi-hats and ride in faster passages. As a result, many drummers in more extreme genres have adopted this technique. Another advantage is a player's access to the floor tom while playing the hi-hats, a feat infamously difficult to pull off in the traditional technique without access to an auxiliary floor tom.|$|R

40|$|Wildfires {{negatively}} affect the overall reproductive success of several woodland avian species, {{but there is}} scarce information about which stages of the nesting cycle are specifically affected. We conducted a 3 -year study to identify the effects of fire on the reproductive parameters of the great tit (Parus major) and the survival of its nests {{at different stages of}} the nesting cycle. We recorded the occupancy rate, clutch and brood size, hatching, fledging and nesting success in nest boxes placed on study plots with different post-fire age. By examining the post-fire succession, we analysed the survival of eggs and nestlings under predation risks. As the forest matured after a wildfire, tits occupied more nest boxes and laid more eggs that suffered less predation than in earlier successional stages. Although the incubation fate improved at each step of succession, the conditions to <b>fully</b> <b>raise</b> nestlings seemed to be suitable only in the oldest woods. Our findings indicate that the population dynamics of a reputed generalist avian species may be affected by fire. Furthermore, the effects of wildfires on stage-specific reproductive parameters show that an avian species that inhabits woodlands regains its full productivity only when its habitat has completely recovered from fire...|$|R
