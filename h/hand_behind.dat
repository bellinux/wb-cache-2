25|$|The one-handed {{shoulder}} pass involves {{holding the}} ball in one <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> the shoulder with the elbow bent, and weight on the back foot. The passer then shifts the weight to the forward foot, while moving the ball with their hand forward and extending the elbow, and releasing the ball as the elbow fully extends at shoulder height. The purpose of the one-handed shoulder pass is {{to throw the ball}} a long distance while throwing the ball hard, fast and direct.|$|E
25|$|Standing {{with legs}} {{slightly}} apart and knees slightly bent, the dancer then bends their left elbow {{to enable them}} to place their left <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> their head. They then outstretch their right arm inline with their right shoulder, hand flat in a vertical position. The dancer then rotates around the waist in a 180 degree sweep, pulling back three times as you move your arm to the left, and then in one motion swing right arm back to the right. The move is then repeated. The dancer may then swap arms and reverse the move.|$|E

[...] Then Mehserle popped up and said, [...] "Tony, Tony, get away, back up, back up." ...|$|R
25|$|During {{her years}} in exile, it is claimed that Svetlana was never happy. Her {{children}} who were {{left behind in the}} Soviet Union did not maintain contact with her. While Western sources saw a KGB <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> this, her children claimed that this is because of her complex character. She flirted with various religions. While some claim she had money problems, others argue that her financial situation was good, because of her great popularity. For example, her first book, Twenty Letters to a Friend, caused a worldwide sensation and brought her, as some allege, about 2.5 million dollars.|$|E
25|$|The 1971 war saw {{the release}} of two special aerogrammes. The first one {{released}} for general use depicted a <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> a barbwire to symbolise the POWs being held in India. The second one was released with reduced rates {{to be used for}} sending mail to the POWs. In 1982, two special aerogrammes were released. They were overprints in gold on the Rs. 2 ones, and issued to commemorate the International Stamp Exhibition, Philexfrance and Intentional Stamp Fair, Riccione, Italy. In 1990, to commemorate the golden jubilee of the Pakistan Resolution passed in Lahore (1940), the Post Office used a special aerogramme depicting Quaid-e-Azam, Mohammad Ali Jinnah.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his protective equipment, a catcher usually also adopts practices that minimize his risk of injury. For instance, unlike fielders elsewhere on the field, a catcher tries, to the extent possible, to catch the ball with his gloved hand alone. An outfielder may catch a fly ball by covering the ball, once it strikes {{the pocket of his}} glove, with his bare hand in order to secure it. The catcher, however, tries to keep his bare hand, which is highly vulnerable to injury, out of harm's way by presenting the pitcher with a target (the large round glove) while hiding his unprotected throwing <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> his back. By doing so, the bare hand cannot be struck by a foul tip. Many broken fingers, split fingernails, and grotesque dislocations are avoided by adherence to this simple expedient.|$|E

25|$|Yoneda' {{place is}} filled by Kaede Fujieda, sister of Sakura Wars protagonist Ayame Fujieda. With Yoneda gone, the Flower Division comes under {{political}} pressure from Keigo Kyogoku, a former Imperial Army officer turned formidable and callous politician who believes the Imperial Assault Force are unnecessary. The group are forced into hiding when Kyogoku launches {{a military coup}} d'état against Tokyo's government and the group's theater bace. Kyogoku is revealed to be the guiding <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> the Black Demons, having orchestrated events to reactivate a dormant magical weapon and rule as king. The Imperial Assault Force—along with Yoneda, who survived the assassination attempt, and Kaede, who survived {{the assault on the}} theatre—launch an assault on the weapon, with Sakura facing the Demon King himself—his defeat reveals him to be Sakura's resurrected father Kazuma Shinguji. Their combined power destroys the weapon and kills Kyogoku, allowing Tokyo to return to normal. Following a promotion to Lieutenant, Ogami is sent overseas to train a new Assault Force.|$|E
500|$|On {{developing}} the mobile phone version of Crash Boom Bang!, producer Elodie Larre described adapting a party {{game for the}} mobile phone as a [...] "big challenge". Not wanting to make [...] "another multiplayer game where the players just pass the phone to each other" [...] and hoping to attract both old and new fans of the series, the development team decided to integrate the mobile phone itself into the minigames, creating such minigame gimmicks as playing with one <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> the back, with one eye closed, playing with the chin, etc. The biggest challenge for the team was keeping the minigames inside the phone's memory, which was cited as slightly inferior to the first PlayStation console. The WarioWare series was described as an influence in making the game.|$|E
500|$|In May 1928, the KCA {{launched}} a Kikuyu-language magazine, Muĩgwithania (roughly translated as [...] "The Reconciler" [...] or [...] "The Unifier"), {{in which it}} published news, articles, and homilies. Its purpose was to help unify the Kikuyu and {{to raise funds for}} the KCA. Kenyatta, now described as Secretary of the KCA, was listed as the publication's editor, although Murray-Brown suggested that he was not the guiding <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> it and that his duties were largely confined to translating things into Kikuyu. Kenyatta's approach to campaigning was cautious; he was aware that Thuku had been exiled for his activism. In Muĩgwithania, he expressed support for the churches, district commissioners, and chiefs. He also praised the British Empire, stating that: [...] "The first thing [...] is that all people are governed justly, big or small – equally. The second thing is that nobody is regarded as a slave, everyone is free to do what he or she likes without being hindered." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many {{scholars}} {{argue that}} the Union held an insurmountable long-term advantage over the Confederacy in industrial strength and population. Confederate actions, they argue, only delayed defeat. Civil War historian Shelby Foote expressed this view succinctly: [...] "I think that the North fought that war with one <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> its back... If there had been more Southern victories, and a lot more, the North simply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back. I don't think the South ever {{had a chance to}} win that War." ...|$|E

However, shocks and electrocution may still occur if both poles of the transformer are contacted by bare skin. Previously it was suggested that repairmen [...] "work with one <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> their back" [...] to avoid touching two parts of the device under test at the same time, thereby preventing a circuit from crossing through the chest and interrupting cardiac rhythms/ causing cardiac arrest.|$|E

The move was due to long-standing ideological differences, such as the group's opposition to the use of foreign jihadis, according to its spokesperson, and was described as [...] "a significant setback for al-Shabab".

2500|$|While {{praise for}} the opening {{ceremony}} was widespread amongst the world's media, the Singaporean newspaper The Straits Times described some western media reactions as [...] "cynical" [...] and [...] "hostile". The Globe and Mail had a column with title [...] "The iron <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> the magic show", some questioned the [...] "heavy military theme". Asia Times, although praising the show as [...] "stunning opening ceremony... with its panoply of color, painstaking choreography and sweeping portrait of Chinese culture and history" [...] referred to the games as one devoid of [...] "fun" [...] in its article headlined [...] "Awe (but no laughter) in Beijing". The artist Ai Weiwei also criticized the ceremonies, comparing them unfavorably to the British Olympic ceremonies of 2012, which produced a sense of intimacy and a [...] "clear understanding of what England was." [...] Others {{have pointed out that}} the ceremony committee purposefully tried to find a Chinese aesthetic that valorized community and working together to produce a good result.|$|E
2500|$|Much of Zorn's {{classical}} work {{is dedicated}} or inspired by {{artists who have}} influenced his world view; [...] (1997) contains tributes to Marguerite Duras and Olivier Messiaen.; Songs from the Hermetic Theatre (2001) features compositions dedicated to Harry Smith, Joseph Beuys, and Maya Deren.; Madness, Love and Mysticism (2001) featured [...] "Le Mômo", inspired by Antonin Artaud and [...] "Untitled", dedicated to Joseph Cornell.; and Chimeras (2001) was based on Arnold Schoenberg's atonal composition [...] "Pierrot Lunaire". Several of Zorn's later concert works drew inspiration from mysticism and the works of Aleister Crowley in particular; Magick (2004) featured {{a group called the}} Crowley Quartet. A 2009 performance of the albums centerpiece, [...] "Necronomicon", was described as [...] "...frenetic vortexes of violent, abrasive motion, separated by eerily becalmed, suspenseful sections with moody, even prayerful melodies. The music is sensational and evocative, but never arbitrary; you always sense a guiding <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> the mayhem".|$|E
