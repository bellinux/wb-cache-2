5|$|Although Bede {{is mainly}} studied as a {{historian}} now, in his time his works on grammar, chronology, and biblical studies were as important as his historical and hagiographical works. The non-historical works contributed greatly to the Carolingian renaissance.

25|$|The Glazert burn, {{previously}} Glazart or Glassert has otters and {{the rare}} freshwater mussel (source of freshwater pearls). The name {{may come from}} the celtic, glas in Gaelic meaning grey or green and dur meaning water. It is recorded by Dobie in 1876 as being a favourite resort of fishermen and this <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> the case today (2006). Another River Glazert, runs through a considerable part of the parish of Campsie, emptying itself into the Kelvin, opposite the town of Kirkintilloch.|$|E

25|$|Island {{jewellery}} <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> primal {{because of}} the lack of communication with outside cultures. Some areas of Borneo and Papua New Guinea are yet to be explored by Western nations. However, the island nations that were flooded with Western missionaries have had drastic changes made to their jewellery designs. Missionaries saw any type of tribal jewellery as a sign of the wearer's devotion to paganism. Thus many tribal designs were lost forever in the mass conversion to Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Carlisle {{also became}} a major railway centre with at one time 7 {{different}} companies using Carlisle Citadel railway station. Prior to {{the building of the}} Citadel railway station, Carlisle had several railway stations, including London Road railway station. Carlisle also used to have the largest railway marshaling yard in Europe at Kingmoor which, although reduced in size, <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> operational and used by railfreight companies like Colas Rail Freight, Freightliner Heavy Haul, DB Schenker Rail UK (formerly EWS) and very occasionally Direct Rail Services.|$|E
25|$|Temporary {{heat sinks}} are {{sometimes}} used while soldering circuit boards, preventing excessive heat from damaging sensitive nearby electronics. In the simplest case, this means partially gripping a component using a heavy metal crocodile clip, hemostat or similar clamp. Modern semiconductor devices, which {{are designed to}} be assembled by reflow soldering, can usually tolerate soldering temperatures without damage. On the other hand, electrical components such as magnetic reed switches can malfunction if exposed to hotter soldering irons, so this practice <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in use.|$|E

25|$|Modern Sayram <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> a part {{of ancient}} Central Asia. Unlike most of Kazakhstan, it bears almost no mark of Soviet {{planning}} or modernization. The streets curve in many directions, while {{the center of the}} town occupies the same crossroads that have been used for centuries. There are no apartments in the city proper, and no buildings more than two stories high, allowing the skyline to be dominated by the domes of local minarets, mosques, and mausoleums, some more than 1,000 years old.|$|E
25|$|With PFGE, {{a method}} which <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> used {{dating back to}} its first success in 1980s, remains capable of helping {{differentiate}} MRSA isolates. To accomplish this, the technique uses multiple gel electrophoresis, along with a voltage gradient to display clear resolutions of molecules. The S. aureus fragments then transition down the gel, producing specific band patters that are later compared with other isolates in hopes of identifying related strains. Limitations of the method include practical difficulties with uniform band patterns and PFGE sensitivity as a whole.|$|E
25|$|As an oxidant, {{silver nitrate}} should be {{properly}} stored away from organic compounds. Despite its common usage in extremely low concentrations to prevent gonorrhea and control nose bleeds, silver nitrate <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> toxic and corrosive. Brief exposure will not produce any immediate side effects {{other than the}} purple, brown or black stains on the skin, but upon constant exposure to high concentrations, side effects will be noticeable, which include burns. Long-term exposure may cause eye damage. Silver nitrate {{is known to be}} a skin and eye irritant. Silver nitrate has not been thoroughly investigated for potential carcinogenic effect.|$|E

25|$|As of March 2016, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Partridge of the Metropolitan Police Service's Homicide & Major Crime Commend has said:This case <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> a live investigation. Farouk Abdulhak remains {{wanted for}} {{the rape and}} murder of Martine Vik Magnussen. Farouk Abdulhak has known {{for the past eight years}} now that he is wanted for the {{rape and murder of}} Magnussen. There have been {{extensive}} diplomatic efforts made over this time to return him to the UK, to no avail. This anniversary should serve as a further reminder that he cannot put this behind him, it will not go away and I appeal to him and those close to him to advise him to return to the UK to stand trial.|$|E
25|$|JR {{is beyond}} despair, {{but rather than}} {{drinking}} his sorrows away, {{he talks about his}} feelings in great detail to Babe, something which Babe has always wanted from him. Babe blames herself for Dixie's death. JR assures her that he would never wish her dead in his mother's place, but when he catches Babe and Josh kissing in a shed, he forces her to choose between her mother's secret of being pregnant with Tad's baby or custody of Little Adam. Babe pleads with JR that the kiss he witnessed was just a goodbye kiss, and that she <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in love with him, but JR does not believe her. Babe is devastated when JR verbally lashes out that she should have died instead of Dixie.|$|E
25|$|Overall, Jean-Jacques Furer {{concludes that}} the {{shrinkage}} of the Romansh-speaking areas is continuing, though at different rates depending on the region. At the same time, he notes that Romansh <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> alive, a fact that is obvious in those areas where it retains a strong presence, such as {{most parts of the}} Surselva and the Lower Engadine. It is also assured that Romansh will continue to be transmitted for several more generations, even though each succeeding generation will be more and more rooted in German as well as Romansh. As a result, if the overall linguistic situation does not change, speakers will slowly become fewer and fewer with each generation. He also concludes however, that there are still enough speakers to ensure that Romansh will survive in the long term at least in certain regions. He considers the Romansh-language school system to be the single most crucial factor in this.|$|E

25|$|The {{other major}} {{sticking}} point, which is reportedly causing concern at government level, {{is that the}} majority of people going to Potsdamer Platz are visitors to the city, implying that the original vision of the development as a linking element attracting Berliners themselves, and Berliners {{from both sides of the}} former divide, has not really materialised. There are criticisms that the development does not sit easily with or connect with its surroundings, and as a result Berliners have had difficulty accepting it as theirs (despite the fact that the choice of Hilmer & Sattler's masterplan was partly because it was the only one to address the way the development juxtaposed with the Cultural Forum immediately to the west, although the Cultural Forum has itself faced similar criticisms of its own). Another, more psychological factor that has played a part here is that a long-standing mutual distrust or antipathy felt between former East Berliners and West Berliners (Ossis and Wessis according to the well-known slang terms), <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in evidence in the city and elsewhere in Germany, and bold civil engineering projects and architectural statements are not going to make it go away by themselves. Politicians past and present have been accused of short-sightedness in speculating that they would.|$|E
25|$|Mark grows fond of Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin), {{who is in}} a rocky {{relationship}} with his enemy, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). When she leaves Phil, she turns to Mark. Mark takes her in and they start dating, much to Pauline's horror. Together, they concoct a plan to pretend that she is expecting Mark's baby when Phil is the actual biological father. To facilitate their lie, Mark insists that he'd taken all necessary precautions in relation to his HIV and they fool everyone for a while. Mark loves Lisa so much that he stays with her after she shoots Phil (who survives), and Mark proposes shortly after baby Louise's birth. However, Louise's godmother, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), tells Phil the truth about Louise's parentage and vows to {{take an active role in}} his daughter's upbringing. Mark and Lisa marry, but their happiness is short-lived: Lisa <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in love with Phil and Phil knows it so he seduces her in order to get more access to Louise. After Sharon discovers Phil's intentions, she talks him out of his plan and he ends the affair with Lisa, but Mark finds out and leaves the Square for a while. After just five months of marriage, Lisa leaves Mark and resumes her affair with Phil. However, Lisa soon realizes her mistake and wants to reconcile with Mark but Pauline refuses to tell her where Mark has gone.|$|E

500|$|During {{interviews}} {{following the}} Pulitzer announcement, Akhtar {{said that the}} play's title has both a literal and a metaphorical meaning. Literally, Amir plays out his disgrace in almost real time before the audience. Metaphorically, Akhtar says [...] "There are ways that the colonial history of the West is still playing out in the Muslim world.

500|$|Of {{working with}} Stewart and The-Dream, Lopez stated that: [...] "What I love about great {{producers}} and writers {{is that they}} can take you and transport you right into this moment, but not change you.

They took that 'Jenny from the Block' side of me, which <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> a part of who I am and will always be, and they put it right there on that track". According to Scott Shetler of PopCrush, [...] "Run the World" [...] contains an optimistic message and upbeat melody.

500|$|Other {{scholars}} {{disagreed with}} Melton's idea; in 2004 Daren Kemp stated that [...] "New Age <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> alive". Hammer himself stated that [...] "the New Age movement {{may be on}} the wane, but the wider New Age religiosity... shows no sign of disappearing". MacKian suggested that the New Age [...] "movement" [...] had been replaced by a wider [...] "New Age sentiment" [...] which had come to pervade [...] "the socio-cultural landscape" [...] of Western countries. Its diffusion into the mainstream may have been influenced by the adoption of New Age concepts by high profile figures: U.S. First Lady Nancy Reagan consulted an astrologer, British Princess Diana visited spirit mediums, and Norwegian Princess Märtha Louise established a school devoted to communicating with angels.|$|E
