500|$|NBC asked Saturday Night Live {{producer}} Lorne Michaels to add The Land of Gorch to {{the program}} to lighten its overall tone. In its initial contract for Saturday Night Live, NBC required producer Lorne Michaels, short films by comedian Albert Brooks, and Jim Henson and the Muppets. Michaels said he was pleased to be working Henson on his new show: [...] "I'd always liked and {{been a fan of}} [...] and Jim's work". <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> Henson's idea could support a weekly routine on the program. Henson initially called the segment [...] "Muppet Night Creatures" [...] before settling on its final name. [...] "Jim Henson and the Muppets" [...] were marketed as a regular feature of Saturday Night Live before its first episode was hosted by George Carlin.|$|E
500|$|Vollmer {{started as}} thatgamecompany's [...] "feel engineer" [...] in August 2012, but left in April 2013 to [...] "go indie" [...] {{and work on}} his own projects. On his blog, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> the studio's current project would be groundbreaking, though he was unhappy working there. Vollmer tried to write a short story {{in an attempt to}} take a break from games. Before long, he began to play with his {{computer}} keyboard. Vollmer challenged himself to make a game that only used the arrow keys, and prototyped what would become Threes in ten hours overnight. He proceeded to iterate on the idea with Wohlwend over the game's 14-month development. In Threes, the player slides numbered tiles on a four-by-four grid to combine addends and multiples of three. Vollmer cited Drop7 as an inspiration for the game, having played it for two years beforehand.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1997/98 {{series against}} Australia, Srinath's with one {{particular}} delivery measured at 149.6km/h. [...] The Zimbabwe captain Alistair Campbell revealed that Srinath was recorded at 157km/hr on 27 January 1997 {{in the game}} at Paarl between India and Zimbabwe. He said about this game: [...] "We {{then moved on to}} our second game against India, at Boland Bank Park. In all 236 was quite a decent score, as it wasn't the easiest of pitches to bat on, and Srinath I think bowled the quickest that any of our guys had ever seen. He bowled a really quick spell early on, even quicker than Allan Donald; he was timed at 157 km/h, a good 10 km/h faster than Donald was bowling throughout the tournament. Grant Flower was hit on the thigh pad, and when he came off <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> he had broken his leg". (See paragraph 7 of the article by clicking on the below link).|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, {{shortly before}} the Iraq War, Schäuble accused German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of [...] "strengthening Saddam Hussein" [...] by {{undermining}} the unanimity of international pressure on Iraq {{to open up to}} United Nations weapons inspectors. On Schröder's initiative to join forces with President Jacques Chirac of France and President Vladimir Putin of Russia in opposing the war, Schäuble commented: [...] "This triangular relationship involving Berlin, Paris and Moscow was a dangerous development. It was very dangerous for the small countries in Europe because they perceived it as an axis and you can understand why. We want good relations with Russia but we do not want those relations to be misunderstood." [...] Schäuble, in contrast to many German politicians, subsequently defended the United States' decision to invade Iraq. By 2006, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was in itself correct, but that he was [...] "doubtful" [...] from the outset about the Iraq war because it resulted from a unilateral decision by the US.|$|E

2500|$|Fox News {{excluded}} Paul, Duncan Hunter, and Alan Keyes from a January 6 New Hampshire forum, sparking numerous {{protests from}} Paul supporters. Fox said {{that due to}} having limited space in the [...] "souped-up bus" [...] in which the debate was to talk place, they required that the candidates must have been polling at least ten percent in recent nationwide polls {{to be included in}} the debate. In a nationwide poll conducted by the Associated Press and Yahoo, December 14–20, Paul was only polling at three percent which was far short of the threshold necessary for debate inclusion. The Paul campaign said they were not given a reason for the exclusion, and the New Hampshire Republican Party withdrew their sponsorship. Instead of attending, Paul held his own town hall event, where voters were allowed to ask him questions. It was broadcast live on local New Hampshire television and streamed online. Jay Leno invited Paul as a Tonight Show guest January 7 specifically because <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> Paul's exclusion was [...] "unfair." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{finishing}} as runner-up to Colomba Fofana in {{the triple}} jump senior category at the French National Indoor Championships in February 2010 with a jump of 17.01 m, Tamgho {{turned his attention}} on the global stage. At the 2010 World Indoor Championships, he took an early lead in the triple jump final with a jump of 17.41m, but Yoandri Betanzos surprised him with a 17.69m personal best in the first round. Tamgho initially thought a lesser jump {{would have been enough}} to secure the title, but following the Cuban's jump he said [...] "I had to react and give it all". After a couple of fouls and two more jumps past the 17-metre mark, Tamgho had one final jump left to overhaul Betanzos. On his last attempt, he jumped seven centimetres clear of the existing indoor world record mark (jointly held by Aliecer Urrutia and Christian Olsson) to set a new world indoor record of 17.90m and break Pierre Camara's 17-year-old national indoor record of 17.59m. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> his previous season had been flawed, but that he had now grown stronger and matured, following advice from fellow competitors Jadel Gregório and Phillips Idowu to take part in competitions in a calmer manner.|$|E
