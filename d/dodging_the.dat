25|$|However, due to {{the rise}} in {{tensions}} between the East and West over the political landscape of Europe, the threat from the Soviet Union in 1949 and 1950, coinciding with {{the start of the}} Cold War, led to a return to the militaristic policy by the Swedish government. From 1950 until around 1976 the size of the army was at an average of 250 000 soldiers with a peak of 400 000 active duty soldiers during the late 1950s and early 1960s. The mandatory period of service during this period was 22 months for non-educated conscripts and 14 months for college educated ones, with 30 years in the reserve and 30 days of reserve service obligation per 18 months. The compulsory service period included 2 months of basic training and 3 months of advanced occupational training. The rules were badly enforced, but <b>dodging</b> <b>the</b> draft was punishable with a year of imprisonment and the refusal of state social welfare benefits. Only in 1976–77 was there a change in policy where the compulsory service period of all conscripts was reduced and equalized at 14 months.|$|E
500|$|DeBeck {{gained a}} growing {{interest}} into {{the culture of}} Appalachia in the 1930s and amassed a library on the subject that he later donated to Virginia Commonwealth University. [...] Among the books he admired were those featuring Sut Lovingood by George Washington Harris; inside Sut Lovingwood Yarns (1867) DeBeck produced his first sketch of Snuffy Smith, a character that grew from talking with and sketching the Appalachian hillbilly locals. [...] Just as the strip's circulation was starting to flag, DeBeck introduced Snuffy in a storyline in which Barney inherited an estate {{in the mountains of}} North Carolina. [...] After <b>dodging</b> <b>the</b> ornery hillbilly's bullets, the two became fast friends. The strip was eventually renamed Barney Google and Snuffy Smith, and Snuffy would take over from Barney Google as the central character. [...] Lasswell, with his own country roots, provided much of the inspiration for Snuffy and his Appalachian environment. Especially, he provided a source for the locals' dialect. [...] Hillbilly culture enjoyed much popularity in the 1930s; Snuffy Smith appeared the same year as Al Capp's Li'l Abner. [...] By 1940, DeBeck's strip appeared in 210 newspapers with a combined circulation of ten million.|$|E

[...] He recalled, [...] "There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [...] let our hair grow." [...] Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street. [...] Rado said, [...] "It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. [...] You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it. [...] We thought, 'This is happening in the streets,' and we wanted to bring it to the stage." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wobbly lingo is a {{collection}} of technical language, jargon, and historic slang used by the Wobblies, for more than a century. [...] Many Wobbly terms derive from or are coextensive with hobo expressions used through the 1940s. The origin of the name [...] "Wobbly" [...] itself is uncertain. For several decades, many hobos in the United States were members of, or were sympathetic to, the IWW. Because of this, some of the terms describe the life of a hobo such as [...] "riding the rails", living in [...] "jungles", <b>dodging</b> <b>the</b> [...] "bulls". The IWW's efforts to organize all trades allowed the lingo to expand to include terms relating to mining camps, timber work, and farming.|$|E

Shortly after 7:35 the many UH-1 Hueys began their shuttles from the many rooftop pads around town out to the U.S. Navy ships offshore. The fixed-wing aircraft each had assigned pilots, but due to the confusion, many pilots could not get to the airport. Captain E. G.

2500|$|On November 28, 1901, in {{his final}} game as a Wisconsin {{football}} player, Cochems ran back a kickoff for a touchdown against Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons. [...] According to a contemporaneous press account, the touchdown run came {{late in the game}} with Wisconsin already leading 29 to 0: [...] "The Maroons appeared to be demoralized, and on the kick-off Cochems caught the ball on his own twelve-yard line and ran ninety-eight yards for a touchdown, the Chicago players making little or no effort to stop him." [...] Twelve years later, football historian and former University of Wisconsin coach Parke H. Davis described the same run more colorfully, reporting that Cochems [...] "dashed and dodged, plunged and writhed through all opponents for a touch-down... Cochem's great flight presented all of the features of speed, skill, and chance which must combine to, make possible the full-field run... he boldly laid his course against the very center of Chicago's oncoming forwards, bursting their central bastion, and then cleverly sprinting and <b>dodging</b> <b>the</b> secondary defenders." [...] According to Cochems' obituary [...] in the Wisconsin alumnus, his kickoff return against Chicago in 1901 [...] "brought him undying fame as a gridder." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{final game}} of the season matched Michigan against Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons. The game was played on Thanksgiving Day in front of more than 6,000 spectators at Marshall Field in Chicago. Due to the inclement weather, the field had to be [...] "carefully scraped and sawdust {{scattered}} over the thin layer of ice" [...] before the game began. Michigan's first scoring drive came in the first half when the right halfback, John Hollister, took the ball on Chicago's 45-yard line and ran around the right end for a 35-yard gain, a play the press called [...] "a prettily-executed criss cross." [...] Later in the drive, Henninger fumbled the ball which rolled beyond the goal line where it was recovered by Richards for the game's first touchdown. The running of Michigan's fullback John Bloomingston, a Chicago native, was reportedly the high point of the game. A Chicago newspaper described one run by Bloomingston as follows:"Chicago could not gain, and Neel was forced to punt again. [...] Bloomingston received the ball, and, <b>dodging</b> <b>the</b> tacklers, who sought to bring him to the ground, ran back {{the entire length of the}} kick. It was a splendid performance, and no small part of the applause the hero received came from Chicago throats." ...|$|E

2500|$|Back at the Militia Headquarters, whilst Alpha Company were {{crouched}} down behind their vehicles <b>dodging</b> <b>the</b> rocks being thrown at them by an angry crowd, {{they were able}} to distinguish between the sound of rounds being fired from an AK-47 and an SA-80 rifle by their relative pitches. They realized that Bravo were under fire and returning fire themselves. Without communications, Alpha mounted up and drove into the town having to guess where Bravo would be by the sound of the gunfire. Alpha came under sustained and heavy fire at a crossroads [...] from the police station. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) under these conditions is to de-bus. The troops from Alpha spread out with some taking cover under their DAF truck. Despite the short distance and the availability of line of sight, no members of Alpha had seen or recognized the Land Rovers of the RMPs at the police station, though at that point, the Land Rovers may have been moved inside the police station compound. Alpha suppressed the enemy fire, but the DAF truck needed to be jump-started due to mechanical problems. With some troops providing cover, the rest of Alpha pushed the truck until it started. They then mounted up and sped north whilst being targeted by gunmen but managed to reach a point of safety north of the town. They de-bussed and took up defensive positions whilst the sitrep was phoned in to the Ops Room back at Abu Naji.|$|E
2500|$|At this time, Rouvas {{became more}} reclusive and guarded about his {{personal}} life. When he was called for military service in 1994 {{he asked for a}} delay, since his service would coincide with the release of Aima, Dakrya & Idrotas; the request was denied, although other artists had been able to delay their service for career reasons. Although it was initially thought that Rouvas did not want to leave the spotlight when his career was growing, he claimed his reluctance to serve was due to agoraphobia. His claims were met with astonishment; media outlets remarked that agoraphobia was an odd condition for an entertainer, and critics accused him of draft <b>dodging.</b> <b>The</b> singer was taken to the Penteli psychiatric hospital for an evaluation, and it was widely reported that he had attempted suicide. After his release Rouvas fulfilled his military service under psychiatric care; he was required to remove his earring and cut his long hair, which is featured in the video for [...] "Aima, Dakrya & Idrotas". During his service, he was pestered by paparazzi. Psinakis accused Rouvas' psychiatrist of pouring psychotropic drugs into Rouvas' alcoholic beverages because of a previous quarrel. The singer discussed his military service in a wide-ranging interview with Nico Mastorakis. When asked if he was suicidal Rouvas said he did not think so, but he was so drugged {{at the time of the}} emergency call that he did not recall the exact events; he confirmed that he tried to desert by climbing under a Jeep and attaching himself to its undercarriage.|$|E
2500|$|After the convention, Clinton and Gore began a {{bus tour}} around the United States, while the Bush/Quayle {{campaign}} began to criticize Clinton's character, highlighting accusations of infidelity and draft <b>dodging.</b> <b>The</b> Bush campaign emphasized {{its foreign policy}} successes such as Desert Storm, {{and the end of}} the Cold War. Bush also contrasted his military service to Clinton's lack thereof, and criticized Clinton's lack of foreign policy expertise. However, as the economy was the main issue, Bush's campaign floundered across the nation, even in strongly Republican areas, and Clinton maintained leads with over 50 percent of the vote nationwide consistently, while Bush typically saw numbers in the upper 30s. As Bush's economic edge had evaporated, his campaign looked to energize its socially conservative base at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston, Texas. At the Convention, Bush's primary campaign opponent Pat Buchanan gave his famous [...] "culture war" [...] speech, criticizing Clinton's and Gore's social progressiveness, and voicing skepticism on his [...] "New Democrat" [...] brand. After President Bush accepted his renomination, his campaign saw a small bounce in the polls, but this was short lived, as Clinton maintained his lead. The campaign continued with a lopsided lead for Clinton through September, until Ross Perot decided to re-enter the race. Ross Perot's re-entry in the race was welcome by the Bush campaign, as Fred Steeper, a poll taker for Bush, said, [...] "He'll be important if we accomplish our goal, which is to draw even with Clinton." [...] Initially, Perot's return saw the Texas billionaire's numbers stay low, until he was given the opportunity to participate in a trio of unprecedented three-man debates. The race narrowed, as Perot's numbers significantly improved as Clinton's numbers declined, while Bush's numbers remained more or less the same from earlier in the race as Perot and Bush began to hammer at Clinton on character issues once again.|$|E
