30|$|In this work, we further {{improved}} the luminous flux and lumen efficiency of white LEDs {{by a simple}} imprinting technique to form the textured phosphor structure, denoted as LED III. The LEDs with flat phosphor and half-spherical lens structures were denoted as LEDs I and II. With this textured surface, the total internal reflection at the interface of air and silicone could be reduced. Furthermore, this surface increases the probability of blue light scattering, which is supported by <b>haze</b> <b>measurement</b> results. Accordingly, more blue light can excite phosphor again due to the enhancement of utilization efficiency of blue light. Meanwhile, more yellow light can be extracted by the textured phosphor structure. Additionally, we further investigate the far-field emission pattern for LED I, LED II, and LED III, respectively.|$|E
30|$|In summary, we {{successfully}} proposed a simple method to use imprinting technique with a wet-etched c-Si substrate to fabricate the textured phosphor structure. The haze {{intensity of the}} textured phosphor structure shows 78 % enhancement, compared with the flat phosphor structure. With the textured phosphor structure, the total internal reflection at the interface of air and silicone could be reduced. Furthermore, this surface increases the probability of blue light scattering, which {{is supported by the}} <b>haze</b> <b>measurement</b> results. Accordingly, utilization efficiency of blue light is greatly enhanced. Meanwhile, more yellow light can be extracted by the textured phosphor structure. As a result, the enhancement of the luminous flux was 5.4 % and 2.5 % higher than in the flat phosphor and lens molding packages at a driving current of 120 mA, respectively. The advantages of the textured phosphor structure are more compact package, higher lumen output, and larger view angle, which could provide flexible designs to various applications.|$|E

Aqueous solution deposited TCO films would reduce production costs of TCO films but suffer from low electrical mobility, which severely degrades both electrical conductivity and optical transparency in the visible spectrum. Here, we demonstrated that grain boundary modification by ultra-violet laser crystallization (UVLC) of solution deposited aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO) nanocrystals results in high Hall mobility, with a corresponding dramatic improvement in AZO electrical conductance. The AZO films after laser irradiation exhibit electrical mobility up to 18. 1 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1 with corresponding electrical resistivity and sheet resistances {{as low as}} 1 × 10 − 3 Ω cm and 75 Ω/sq, respectively. The high mobility also enabled a high transmittance (T) of 88 %- 96 % at 550 nm for the UVLC films. In addition, <b>HAZE</b> <b>measurement</b> shows AZO film scattering transmittance as low as 1. 8 %, which is superior over most other solution deposited transparent electrode alternatives such as silver nanowires.

30|$|Light {{scattering}} is {{a fundamental}} property of particles and can be adjusted in a great flexibility by finely tuning the particle geometries and surrounding media. This unique feature opens up numerous applications for nanoparticles in spectroscopy, sensors and photovoltaic devices [1 – 3]. For instance, large-angle scattering of nanoparticles is capable of enhancing the light propagation path beyond the physical thickness of devices for absorption improvement, enabling to reduce material usage and resulting manufacturing cost [3 – 7]. As the scattering behaviour is highly wavelength-dependent {{it needs to be}} identified for specific applications. Mostly the scattering behaviour is either simply predicted by theoretical simulations or characterized experimentally by <b>haze</b> <b>measurements</b> [5 – 7]. However, the haze only gives the overall scattered fraction for each wavelength, and is not sufficient to resolve angular scattering details. In this contribution, we will apply angular resolved scattering (ARS) measurements [6 – 8] to characterize the wavelength-dependent scattering behaviour of particles for which only few examples exist so far [9].|$|R

SiO 2 and Zn-SiO 2 doped TiO 2 films, {{on the one}} hand, and Zn doped TiO 2 on the other hand, have been produced using controlled sol-gel processes by alcoholic, cogelation and aqueous ways. From these syntheses, films were deposited on soda lime glass. These samples were compared to ZnO samples but also to bilayer samples constituting one layer of TiO 2 and one layer of ZnO. The physico-chemical properties of the films were characterized by grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction, profilometry and UV-Vis absorption analyses. The photocatalytic activity has been evaluated from the degradation of methylene blue under UV-A light, from the degradation of p-nitrophenol under visible light and from the degradation of H 2 O 2 under halogen light (UV-A + visible light). Superhydrophilicity was evaluated from contact angle measurement after UV exposition and also from hysteresis effects. Finally, a <b>haze</b> <b>measurement</b> was performed to evaluate {{the impact of the}} coating on the aesthetic property of the coated glass. Aqueous films have better photocatalytic activity and superhydrophilicity than samples from alcoholic synthesis. The crystallization of the sample appears to be one key factor: alcoholic films required calcination to ensure the crystallization of TiO 2, but the alkali migration from the glass support prevents this crystallisation, while aqueous synthesis promotes crystallized particles at low temperatures without alkali interference. It appears that the relative activity from one sample to another depends {{on the nature of the}} illumination and on the nature of the molecule to be degraded. Nevertheless, the sample with ZnO layer deposited on first TiO 2 layer (ZnO 500 Alc/TiO 2 100 AQ) composite is found to be the best sample, maintaining a high hydrophilicity similar to TiO 2 and a good activity.

The microscale texture is realised {{at the glass}} surface, using the aluminium-induced texturing (AIT) method, which is an industrially feasible process enabling {{a wide range of}} surface feature sizes (i. e., 700 [*]nm– 3 [*]μm) of the textured glass. The nanoscale texture is made by conventional acid etching of the sputter-deposited transparent conductive oxide (TCO). The influence of the resulting “double texture” on the optical scattering is investigated by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) (studying the surface topology), <b>haze</b> <b>measurements</b> (studying scattering into air), and short-circuit current enhancement measurements (studying scattering into silicon).

Arctic aerosols have been targeted in studies for decades due to their consequential impacts on the energy budget, both directly and indirectly through their ability to modulate cloud microphysics. Even with the breadth of knowledge afforded from these previous studies, aerosols and their effects remain poorly quantified, especially in the rapidly changing Arctic. Additionally, many previous studies involved use of ground-based measurements, and due to the frequent stratified nature of the Arctic atmosphere, brings into question the representativeness of these datasets aloft.

Since these coatings {{are exposed to}} atmospheric conditions and natural environment such as dust, dirt or salt, their resistance to mechanical abrasion and their chemical stability is crucial for their function over lifetime. The use of float glass and a heat treatable and bendable coating is necessary for cost-effective production of curved and toughened glass. At Fraunhofer IST a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) coating has been developed for position 1 based on a high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) generator. For depositing ITO films at varying deposition parameter a prototype power supply from Advanced Energy was used. This technique offers the interesting possibility to achieve films with low surface roughness and excellent conductivity by using an inline sputter coater. The ionization of the sputtered material helps structuring the formation in the initial steps of film growth. The deposition at low substrate temperatures shows superior electrical properties compared to DC sputtering [1]. Fields of application for this coating are photovoltaics, low emissivity coatings, heat mirrors or panel heaters as well as touch panels and displays. ITO film properties have been studied by optical spectroscopy (UV/VIS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Mechanical stability has been tested by taber abrasion and analysed with <b>haze</b> <b>measurements.</b> Furthermore, the results are compared to conventional DC sputtered ITO films and evaluated in respect of lifetime stability as well as coat and bend applicability...|$|R

In particular, the so-called active packaging technologies were developed {{as a response to the}} market needs for minimally treated foodstuffs, in order to preserve their freshness and flavours by regulating the gas composition of the packaging headspace through active scavengers. One of the most promising approaches for this technology is the incorporation of active scavengers into a polymeric matrix. Nevertheless, the design and the production of a functional and effi cient active fl exible package can be difficult to realize because of the complexity of the system. This work was thus focused on the production and the analysis of monolayer polyester films containing an oxygen scavenger. The active fi lm was obtained by adding the active phase into a polyethylene terephthalate matrix during the extrusion process. The barrier properties of the fi lms were investigated by means of conventional permeability measurement, to assess their activity with respect to oxygen. Additionally, the oxygen absorption of the active samples was analysed by an innovative oxygen meter system, in order to determine their scavenging capacity and reaction kinetics. The analysis of colour was carried out on packaged fresh apple slices, to verify if the active fi lms produced were able to limit the oxidation processes on a sensitive food.

Longitudinal multi-level predictive models {{as a function of}} PET grades and exposure types were developed for the change in yellowness index (YI) and haze (%). Exposures with similar change in YI were modeled using a linear fixed-effects modeling approach. Due to the complex nature of <b>haze</b> formation, <b>measurement</b> uncertainty, and the differences in the samples' responses, the change in haze (%) depended on individual samples' responses and a linear mixed-effects modeling approach was used. When compared to fixed-effects models, the addition of random effects in the haze formation models significantly increased the variance explained. For both modeling approaches, diagnostic plots confirmed independence and homogeneity with normally distributed residual errors. Predictive R 2 values for true prediction error and predictive power of the models demonstrated that the models were not subject to over-fitting. These models enable prediction under pre-defined exposure conditions for a given exposure time (or photo-dosage in case of UV light exposure). PET degradation under cyclic exposures combining UV light and condensing humidity is caused by photolytic and hydrolytic mechanisms causing yellowing and haze formation.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThis {{report is}} {{primarily}} concerned with {{a detailed description of}} an automatic haze recorder. An introductory haze discussion is included to facilitate the overall evaluation of the program. Although there is a wealth of experimental data for ground-to-ground <b>haze</b> <b>measurements.</b> there exist only fragmentary data for the air-to-ground case. The data of Waldram, and Carman and Carruthers comprise the known extent of published aerial haze studies which are statistically based on a series of programmed flight-test measurements. Even in these cases the number of flights was small. It is therefore essential to the formation of a statistical model of the atmosphere that extensive flight measurements be made over various conditions and up to altitudes of 40000 ft. The automatic haze recorder consists basically of an airborne telephotometer and its associated equipment: the telephotometer itself, an indexing mount~ a recording assembly, and a control assembly and starting box. Each of these items is described in detail. The base of the telephotometer consists of a device which rotates a right prism about an axis normal and concentric to one of its faces. The telephotometer is mounted on the floor of an aircraft in such a manner that this prism assembly extends below the bottom skin of the aircraft, and that the axis of the prism rotation is maintained parallel {{to the surface of the}} earth. The upwelling light from a 15 ° cone entering the prism is reflected along its axis of rotation and, by means of a fixed right prism into the photometric system. In this manner the rotating prism scans a path 15 ° wide, which stretches beneath the aircraft from horizon to horizon. In the photometric system the upwelling light is projected through an appropriate filter onto a photomultiplier tube. The output of this tube is read directly as the vertical deflection of an oscilloscope which is mounted in the recording assembly. The horizontal deflection of this scope is made proportional to the scanning angle by a gear-driven potentiometer. In this manner the scope makes a trace of upwelling intensity vs angle for a given set of conditions. Each scope trace, together with other pertinent data, is photographed by the recording assembly. The indexing mount rotates the telephotometer, and thus the scanning plane, about the vertical axis. The control assembly, once started, automatically cycles the overall system in the following manner. A blue record, then a green record, then a red record are separately photographed at the indexing mount setting (azimuth) of 0 °. Then the mount turns the instrument to an azimuth of 45 ° and the above three records are made again. This sequence is repeated at settings of 90 °, 135 °, 180 °, 135 °, 90 °, and 45 °. The head is then returned to 0 °, and the assembly is again ready for another cycle. The lapsed time of the complete cycle is somewhat less than 1 / 3 of a minute. The instrument has been constructed and successfully laboratory-tested. It has had only a single, preliminary flight test, but on this the performance equaled or exceeded the design expectations. Proposals for future flight-test programs are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Recent cirrus cloud {{modeling}} {{studies have}} involved {{the application of}} a time-dependent, two dimensional Eulerian model, with generalized cloud microphysical parameterizations drawn from experimental findings. For computing the ice versus vapor phase changes, the ice mass content is linked to the maintenance of a relative humidity with respect to ice (RHI) of 105 percent; ice growth occurs both with regard to the introduction of new particles and the growth of existing particles. In a simplified cloud model designed to investigate the basic role of various physical processes in the growth and maintenance of cirrus clouds, these parametric relations are justifiable. In comparison, the one dimensional cloud microphysical model recently applied to evaluating the nucleation and growth of ice crystals in cirrus clouds explicitly treated populations of haze and cloud droplets, and ice crystals. Although these two modeling approaches are clearly incompatible, the goal of the present numerical study is to develop a parametric treatment of new ice particle generation, on the basis of detailed microphysical model findings, for incorporation into improved cirrus growth models. For example, the relation between temperature and the relative humidity required to generate ice crystals from ammonium sulfate haze droplets, whose probability of freezing through the homogeneous nucleation mode are a combined function of time and droplet molality, volume, and temperature. As an example of this approach, the results of cloud microphysical simulations are presented showing the rather narrow domain in the temperature/humidity field where new ice crystals can be generated.

Spectroscopy in the middle to long infrared wavelengths can also probe levels where dust of <b>haze</b> limit <b>measurements</b> at shorter wavelength or can provide ambiguous results on atmospheric species abundances or winds. A spectroscopic technique in the middle infrared wavelengths analogous to a radio receiver. infrared heterodyne spectroscopy [1], will be describe and used to illustrate the detailed study of atmospheric phenomena not readily possible with other methods. The heterodyne spectral resolution with resolving power greater than 1, 000. 000 measures the true line shapes of emission and absorption lines in planetary atmospheres. The information on the region of line formation is contained in the line shapes. The absolute frequency of the lines can be measured to I part in 100, 000, 000 and can be used to accurately measure the Doppler frequency shift of the lines, directly measuring the line-of-sight velocity of the gas to [...] Im/s precision (winds). The technical and analytical methods developed and used to measure and analyze infrared heterodyne measurements will be described. Examples of studies on Titan, Venus, Mars, Earth, and Jupiter will be presented. 'These include atmospheric dynamics on slowly rotating bodies (Titan [2] and Venus [3] and temperature, composition and chemistry on Mars 141, Venus and Earth. The discovery and studies of unique atmospheric phenomena will also be described, such as non-thermal and lasing phenomena on Mars and Venus, mid-infrared aurora on Jupiter [5], and results of small body impacts on Jupiter [6]. The heterodyne technique can also be applied for detailed study of the Earth's stratosphere and mesosphere by measuring trace constituent abundances and temporal and spatial variability as well as winds, which provide information of transport. All ground-based measurements will be described as complementary and supporting studies for on-going and future space missions [7] (Mars Express, Venus Express, Cassini Huygens, JUNO, ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, and the Europa Jupiter System Mission, an Earth Science Venture Class missions), Proposed instrument and technology development for a space flight infrared heterodyne spectrometer will be described...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the effect of postcollagen {{crosslinking}} (CXL) <b>haze</b> on the <b>measurement</b> and repeatability of pachymetry and mean keratometry (Km) of four corneal topographers. Materials and Methods: Sixty eyes of sixty patients with progressive keratoconus who had undergone accelerated CXL (ACXL) underwent imaging with a scanning slit imaging device (Orbscan II) and three Scheimpflug imaging devices (Pentacam HR, Sirius, and Galilei). Post-ACXL haze was measured using the densitometry software on the Pentacam HR. Readings of the thinnest corneal thickness (TCT) and Km from three scans of each device were analyzed. Effect of haze on the repeatability of TCT and Km measurements was evaluated using regression models. Repeatability was assessed by coefficient of variation. Results: Corneal densitometry in different zones affected the repeatability of TCT measurement of Orbscan (P < 0. 05) significantly but not the repeatability of TCT with Pentacam HR and Sirius (P = 0. 03 and 0. 05, respectively). Km values were affected by haze when measured with the Pentacam HR (P < 0. 05). The repeatability of Km readings for all devices was unaffected by haze. In the anterior 0 – 2 mm and 2 – 6 mm zone, TCT (P = 0. 43 and 0. 45, respectively), Km values (P = 0. 4 and 0. 6, respectively), repeatability of TCT (P = 0. 1 in both zones), and Km (P = 0. 5 and 0. 1, respectively) with Galilei were found to be the most reliable. Conclusion: Galilei measurements appear to be least affected by post-ACXL haze when compared with other devices. Hence, topography measurements in the presence of haze need to be interpreted with caution...|$|R
