40|$|The first {{generation}} of precast concrete deck system, NUDECK, was implemented on the Skyline Bridge, Omaha, NE in 2004. The second generation of NUDECK system was developed to further simplify the system and improve its constructability and durability. The new generation consists of full-width full-depth precast concrete <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> that are 12 ft long to minimize the number of <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> and transverse joints, and consequently accelerate bridge construction. It also uses covered individual pockets and bundled shear connectors at 4 ft spacing to simplify panel and girder production and {{eliminate the need for}} deck overlay. Precast <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> are pre-tensioned in transverse direction and post-tensioned in the longitudinal direction to enhance deck durability. Post-tensioning strands are placed underneath the <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> (at the haunch area) to eliminate threading strands through ducts and grouting operations. The objective of this project is to investigate the constructability of the 2 nd generation NUDECK system through full-scale testing of two key features: 1) using self-consolidating concrete (SCC) to fill the gap between precast concrete <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> and bridge girders as well as covered deck pockets; and 2) using the proposed deviators and anchorage block in the end <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> for post-tensioning the bridge deck. These investigations includes evaluating the pumpability/pouring of the developed SCC mixture in mockup and full-scale specimens.

Use of GFRP in construction is rapidly growing in last few years. The reason for use GFRP is its low self weight in compare of strength and high resistance against weather influenced degradation resulting in long life. Using GFRP for the construction of the bridge deck leads to lightweight construction that can pass the required wheel load. Lightweight design is appreciated for temporary bridge which is expected to be transported and assembled often on places of current need. Long durability and resistance against weather degradation also reduces maintenance costs of bridge deck.

40|$|The use of precast {{concrete}} deck panels {{is becoming increasingly}} popular for bridge construction and rehabilitation {{in the state of}} Utah and across the country. It allows for the use of full depth concrete deck panels but removes the long construction times of traditional cast-in-place methods. One of the challenges to the use of precast deck panels is the transverse <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> joints that exist between the panels. These joints are unreinforced using traditional methods and therefore are the weakest section of the bridge. In many situations the joint will fail and water seeps through and can damage the bridge superstructure. Post-tensioning of precast decks has become the standard. The post-tensioning provides reinforcing through the joints, reducing the cracking that occurs. Additionally, the post-tensioning provides pressure along the joint and closes cracks that have occurred, therefore preventing water from leaking through to the superstructure and damaging it. The Utah Department of Transportation uses post-tensioning cables that run {{along the length of the}} bridge deck, applying pressure on the joints. One of the problems with using this method is it does not allow for the replacement of a single <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> should the need arise. Utah State University has been researching a new post-tensioned connection that would allow for the replacement of a single <b>deck</b> <b>panel.</b> The “curved bolt” connection connects each <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> to adjacent panels, providing reinforcement and post-tensioning along the joint. Laboratory testing was undertaken to investigate the effects of single panel bridge rehabilitation on the existing deck system...|$|E
40|$|To further {{enhance the}} {{application}} of fiber reinforced composites in construction, {{it will be important}} to assess the life-cycle costs of replacing conventional construction materials with advanced composites. However, the lack of sufficient reference data or maintenance records for advanced-composite applications in construction makes it difficult to make a credible assessment for life-cycle costs. The available reference data are limited to include performance information from recent applications, initial cost figures, some deterioration models, and its material properties. ^ Therefore, a practical method is required that would allow probable assessment of the life-cycle cost of advanced composite applications in construction in relation to conventional materials. The overall objective of this research was to develop a performance-based probable life-cycle cost assessment model for composite materials in construction. To achieve these objectives, the research focused on a specific application of composites in construction: FRP bridge <b>deck</b> <b>panels.</b> The model thus developed can then be used for other applications of composites in construction. ^ The life-cycle cost assessment model for FRP bridge <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> comprises of a life-cycle performance module (module- 1) and a life-cycle cost optimization module (module- 2). The objective of module- 1 is to develop an analytical model that is capable of predicting the structural deterioration over time in order to assess the deterioration rating per year (CR/year) of FRP bridge <b>deck</b> <b>panels.</b> The objective of module- 2 is to develop an analytical model that is capable of assessing the optimal life-cycle cost of FRP bridge <b>deck</b> <b>panels.</b> Three case studies were conducted to validate the logic and results of the process algorithm for the life-cycle cost assessment.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{investigation of}} the use of ultrasonic consolidation (UC) to produce deck panels for small satellites was undertaken. Several fabrication methods for producing structural panels and decking were analyzed. Because of its ability to create aluminum objects in an additive fashion, and at near-room temperatures, UC was found to be a powerful solution for creating highly integrated and modular satellite panels. It also allowed a lightweight and stiff deck to be fabricated without the use of adhesives. A series of experiments were performed to understand the issues associated with creating a sandwich-type structure using UC. The experiments used a peel test apparatus to evaluate the bond strength for various geometric configurations and materials. Aluminum 3003 was chosen as the sole material constituting the <b>deck</b> <b>panel.</b> The honeycomb lattice was found to offer the best core configuration due to its ability to resist vibration from the sonotrode and provide adequate support for pressure induced by the sonotrode. Support materials for enhancing the bonding of the facings to the core were investigated but did not lead to implementation. A CAD model was created to integrate the honeycomb core, facings, and modular bolt pattern into the ultrasonically consolidated structure. The model was used to develop a build procedure for fabricating the deck on the UC machine. A finite element analysis was performed that used an equivalent properties method to represent the deck. The stiffness of a prototype deck was evaluated in a three-point bending test and the results were found to correlate with the finite element model. A sine sweep vibration test was then performed on the prototype <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> to measure its natural frequencies.

40|$|Structural {{inspection}} is {{a critical}} part of the ship structural integrity assessment. Corrosion, as a very pervasive type of structural degradation, can potentially lead to catastrophic failure or unanticipated out-of-service time. In order to mitigate the unfavorable consequences of age-related structural failure, a wisely planned inspection is needed. The current practice of calendar-based inspection of ship structures may cause either an unexpected stoppage during normal routine due to unpredicted structural failures or yield higher costs for unnecessary inspections. Therefore, a strategy to determine timely and effective inspection plans is highly desirable. Probabilistic tools have been used in ship structure analysis for years. Recently, there is revived interest in the reliability-based inspection planning of ship structures. This study is devoted to demonstrating a practical methodology and procedure that adopts a reliability-based approach in structural inspection planning of ship structures. Scheduling a gauging survey for <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> of oil tankers is used to demonstrate the proposed procedure. This approach includes the derivation of explicit limit state functions for the ultimate strength failure of <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> based on the equations stated in the International Association of Classification Societies’ Common Structure Rules for double hull oil tanker (2008), and quantifies the various types of uncertainties involved. A time-variant probabilistic corrosion model is derived based on the gauging data collected by the American Bureau of Shipping. Monte Carlo Simulation method with Latin Hypercube Sampling is used for calculating time-variant probability of ultimate strength failure is obtained. By comparing the calculated failure probabilities with the target reliability levels, the inspection intervals can then be determined. The reliability formulations derived in this study are applied to a case study in which the reliability assessment of the <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> and associated inspection planning of a total of six oil tanker ship designs are carried out. Sensitivity analyses are also performed to investigate the relative contribution of each basic variable. The limitation of the proposed procedure is also discussed along with potential future work...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{analysis}} {{programs and}} empirical formulae {{are often used}} to compute the period of vibration of single-storey steel buildings. Recent ambient vibration tests of buildings in Quebec and British Columbia {{have shown that the}} predicted period of vibration is typically much longer than that measured. Software and empirical formulae do not usually take into account the stiffening effects of the non-structural components; this could be the source of the discrepancy between the results in the field and the results obtained by computational methods. This research project concentrates on the roof diaphragm system of single-storey steel buildings and the contribution of the non-structural components to diaphragm stiffness. It is believed that the non-structural components, roofing materials such as gypsum board and fibreboard, add to the overall stiffness of the system. A roofing system called AMCQ SBS- 34 consisting of gypsum board, ISO insulation board and fibreboard, all hot bitumen adhered, was studied. The full roof system, as well as its individual components and connections, were first studied through laboratory testing. The flexural and shear stiffness of the fibreboard and gypsum panels, as well as the shear stiffness and equivalent flexural stiffness of the complete roof system and shear stiffness of the roofing connections were determined. Linear elastic finite element models, using the SAP 2000 software, were developed to replicate the behaviour of bare sheet steel and clad diaphragm test specimens. The test based properties of the roofing components and connections were incorporated into the definition of the elements. The models were then calibrated {{based on the results of}} large-scale diaphragm tests by Yang. Once the elastic behaviour of the diaphragms had been matched, a parametric study was performed in order to assess the importance of the contribution of the roofing assembly relative to the roof <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> thickness. It was shown that as the deck thickness increases, the relative contribution of the non-structural components decreases on a percentage basis, but does not become non-negligible. The increase in shear stiffness of the diaphragm ranges from 58. 6 % for the 0. 76 mm <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> to 4. 7 % for the 1. 51 mm roof <b>deck</b> <b>panel,</b> dependent on the sidelap and deck-to-frame connection configuration...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{two independent}} systems {{which can be}} implemented in the stringer bridges with high performance. They relate to the threaded rod bridge continuity system making precast girders continuous for deck weight and NUDECK precast bridge <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> system. ^ Prestressed concrete girder bridges are generally made continuous by adding longitudinal reinforcement in the deck over the pier. With this continuity method, the superstructure is continuous only for one-third of the total load. The pier diaphragm, which is normally cast prior to the deck, may experience distress because no negative moment resistance is available as the deck is being placed. An innovative threaded rod continuity system was introduced to make the precast girders continuous for deck weight, which results in reduced demand for prestress and for high strength concrete at release. The same girder size can span 10 to 15 percent longer than the conventional system. Bridge structural performance is significantly improved without causing cracking at the piers. The Clarks Viaduct in Nebraska is the first bridge in the United States implementing this system. Its completion shows this system is cost-effective and easy to construct without need for a specialty contractor. ^ The second objective of this dissertation is to develop an efficient precast bridge <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> system. Most of the deficiency in existing stringer-type bridges lies in deterioration of the bridge deck. Cast-in-place reinforced concrete decks experience cracking shortly after construction due to their large differential creep and shrinkage with the supporting beams, and due to the temperature drop they experience in the hydration cycle. The NUDECK (Nebraska University) system is a full-depth precast/prestressed concrete bridge <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> system. The combination of high performance precast concrete, where little creep and shrinkage occur after the deck is made composite with the beams, and two-way prestressing assure of continued pre-compression of the deck during its life. Construction time is greatly cut and the traveling public is least inconvenienced. Implementation of this system {{in the design and}} construction of the Skyline Bridge (89 ft + 125 ft with a 25 ° skew) in Omaha, Nebraska is presented. ...|$|E

Different concept designs where the steel top plate was replaced by an aluminium structure were evaluated by utilizing engineering beam theory, goal driven optimization and finite element analysis.

40|$|Summary: This paper {{describes}} the design, modeling, {{and testing of}} two portable timber bridges, each consisting of two non-interconnected longitudinal glued-laminated timber (glulam) <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> 1. 8 m (6 ft) wide. One bridge is 12. 2 m (40 ft) long while the other bridge is 10. 7 m (35 ft) long. The <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> are fabricated in a unique double-tee cross section. The bridges exhibited linear elastic behavior in static bending tests. When actual lumber property data were used in transformed section and finite element models, the models overpredicted the stiffness of the bridge panels. The transformed section results provided the best agreement with test results. The bridges were cost effective and although some damaged occurred to the bridge modules during their removal, they have functioned well overall.

To assess USF’s recommendations, a forensic study was undertaken in which the most current inspection and work program documents on the two failed bridges were reviewed and FDOT personnel interviewed. The best repair procedures were determined by reviewing repair plans, specifications, reports and site visits. The study found the two bridges that failed had been correctly prioritized by USF (No. 1 of 18 and No. 8 of 15). A new, accelerated repair method encompassing complete bay replacement was developed in a pilot project funded by the Florida Department of Transportation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a m~thodology {{to assess the}} reliability of an important and representative failure mode of a ship: buckling of the <b>deck</b> <b>panels.</b> This methodology uses tools for evaluation of the limit states, modeling of loads, ge. ometry and material properties, reliability assessment and sensitivity analysis. The proposed methodology esti-mates the failure probabilities of the above failure modes, identifies the most important uncertainties and determines the most effective design modifications that result in the highest improvemtmts in reliability. The methodology is illustrated by analyzing the reliability of a cruiser...|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to refit a bridge originally designed with a concrete or non-structural deck to use an orthotropic deck, which was first utilized in Vancouver's Lions Gate Bridge. For example, San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge, completed in 1937, originally used a concrete deck. Salt carried by fog or mist reached the rebar, causing corrosion and concrete spalling. In 1985, the bridge was restored using orthotropic steel <b>deck</b> <b>panels.</b> The project not only restored the bridge to prime condition but also reduced the deck weight by 12,300 tons (11,160 metric tons).|$|R
