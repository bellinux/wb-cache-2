A component of the time value also arises from the unwinding of the discount rate between now and the expiry date. In the case of a <b>European</b> <b>option,</b> the option cannot be exercised before the expiry date, so it is possible for the time value to be negative; for an American option if the time value is ever negative, you exercise it (ignoring special circumstances such as the security going ex dividend): this yields a boundary condition.|$|E

40|$|A {{new model}} on <b>European</b> <b>options</b> with {{uncertainty}} of both randomness and fuzziness in output is presented, by introducing fuzzy logic to the stochastic financial model. The randomness and fuzziness in the systems are evaluated by both probabilistic expectation and fuzzy expectation, taking account of sellerÕs/buyerÕs subjective judgment. Prices of <b>European</b> call/put <b>options</b> with uncertainty are given and their valuation and properties are discussed under a reasonable assumption. This paper demonstrates Black–Scholes formula to give rational expected {{price of the}} <b>European</b> <b>options</b> and buyerÕs/writerÕs (sellerÕs) permissible range of expected prices. The meaning and properties of rational expected prices are discussed in a numerical example.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the pricing of stock options using the recently developed SABR model. The SABR model assumes the volatility to be stochastic, {{and its main}} advantage compared to other stochastic volatility models is that there exists a direct formula which approximates prices of <b>European</b> <b>options.</b> The main question of this thesis is: • Is the SABR model a good model to use when pricing <b>European</b> and American <b>options?</b> To answer this question, three different subquestions are dealt with, namely: • In which situations is the approximating direct formula good enough to price <b>European</b> <b>options?</b> • What is a good numerical method to price <b>European</b> <b>options</b> under the SABR model? • What is good method to price American options under the SABR model? To price <b>European</b> <b>options</b> under the SABR model, we design two numerical methods. The first one uses Monte Carlo simulations, and the second one {{is based on the}} Vellekoop and Nieuwenhuis tree method. By comparing the results of these two methods and the approximating direct formula, for different chosen values of the parameters, it is shown that the direct formula approximates prices of <b>European</b> <b>options</b> well for most values of the parameters, but not for all. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the two numerical methods give similar results for the price of <b>European</b> <b>options,</b> but that the tree method is much faster. This is why we use this tree method, when applying the SABR model to real market data of <b>European</b> <b>options.</b> To price American options, once more two numerical methods are designed. The first one is based on the Least-Squares Monte Carlo method, and the second one is the same tree method used to price <b>European</b> <b>options</b> under the SABR model, with some slight modifications. By comparing the results of these two methods for the different chosen values of the parameters, we see that the two numerical methods give similar results for the prices of American options, but that the tree method is again much faster. This is why we use this tree method again, when applying the SABR model to real market data of American options. From the results of the fitting of the SABR model to real market data, it follows that the approximating direct formula can be used to price real <b>European</b> <b>options.</b> Furthermore, the results show that the SABR model is indeed a good model to use when pricing <b>European</b> and American <b>options.</b> It is even demonstrated that the SABR model prices American options with short maturity times more accurately than the commonly used Heston model...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we discuss several methods to price <b>European</b> <b>options</b> under the SABR model. In general, methods given in {{literature}} {{are not free}} of arbitrage and/or inaccurate for long maturities. This {{led to the development}} of a new pricing approach. We extend the BCOS method from one dimension to two dimensions. This extension is necessary for application of a simplification of the BCOS method, the DCOS method, to the SABR model. In this pricing method we use the characteristic function of the discrete forward process and the Fourier-based COS method. It is possible to price <b>European</b> <b>options</b> under the SABR model for multiple strikes in one computation with the DCOS method. Besides valuing <b>European</b> <b>options,</b> we can also price Bermudan and discretely monitored barrier options with this pricing approach.
