5|$|There are {{differences}} within the material added by Scribe B. The first 23 stanzas of the B material {{shows signs of}} partial modernisation of the orthography, while the remainder show much more retention of Old Welsh features. Jarman explains this by suggesting that Scribe B started by partially modernising the orthography as he copied the stanzas, {{but after a while}} tired of this and copied the remaining stanzas {{as they were in the}} older manuscript. Isaac suggested that Scribe B was using two sources, called B1 and B2. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>correct,</b> the material in the Books of Aneirin is from three sources.|$|E

Wahlberg's cormorant is very tentatively placed here; it seems anatomically {{more similar to}} the P. fuscscens, but the more informative characters – the combination of frontal crest and lack of extensive naked skin at bill base in mid-sized Old World species – seem to place it here. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>correct,</b> they are probably very distantly related due to biogeography.|$|E

During this time, the internecine {{conflict}} within the Síl nÁedo Sláine continued. Fergal mac Máele Dúin had died in battle in Leinster in 722. Fogartach mac Néill, who had returned to Ireland in 716 and was once again chief king among the southern Uí Néill, later Fergal's deputy, succeeded him. Fogartach was killed in battle against his Síl nÁedo Sláine kinsman Cináed mac Írgalaig in 724. Cináed was killed in 728 fighting against Flaithbertach mac Loingsig of the northern Cenél Conaill who became High King after this victory.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, J. A. Westgate of the University of Toronto {{suggested}} that a smaller eruption may have occurred at the Bridge River Vent after the eruption 2,400years ago, sending tephra southeast. A tephra deposit overlying the Bridge River Ash at Otter Creek shows strong genetic relationships with the Bridge River Ash, differing only by its absence of biotite. In earlier publications, this tephra is classified {{as part of the}} Bridge River Ash. However, it has been dated to be about 2,000radiocarbon years old, indicating that this tephra is a few hundred years younger than the Bridge River Ash. Apparent absence of biotite and occurrence well south of the Bridge River Ash likewise favour a separate identity. Large-volume, fine-grained debris flows north of the volcano might have been caused by volcanic activity. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>correct,</b> the knowledge of eruptions at Mount Meager in the last 10,000years is insufficient.|$|E
500|$|All we can {{be certain}} of is that, {{if there was a}} bishop of Llanbadarn in 601 – and {{possibly}} 720 – there appears to have been none in later years (though note the later use of the style [...] "bishop" [...] during Gerald of Wales's visit in 1188). But that did not diminish the power and influence of the clas at Llanbadarn Fawr. By the middle of the ninth century the clas was clearly the wealthiest in the province. The renowned Asser, scholar and adviser to Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, may have been educated at Llanbadarn Fawr. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>correct</b> it would be a strong indication that Llanbadarn's reputation for learning was well-founded.|$|E

Springer indicated that the statute in question may have been the Act dated June 30, 1864, as amended by an Act dated March 3, 1865, and argued that <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>correct,</b> the 1864 Act did not authorize the sale of the real estate by the Federal tax collector.|$|R

500|$|From the palaeographical evidence, T. Julian Brown {{concluded}} that the Cuthbert manuscript was written after the main text of the Codex Amiatinus, which was finished after 688, perhaps by 695, though it might be later. [...] Turning to the historical evidence for Cuthbert's burial, this placed it after his original burial in 687 but possibly before his elevation to the high altar in 698. [...] <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>correct,</b> the book was never a personal possession of Cuthbert, as has sometimes been thought, but was possibly created specifically {{to be placed in}} his coffin, whether for the occasion of his elevation in 698 or at another date. [...] The less precise hints about dating that can be derived from the style of the binding compared to other works did not conflict with these conclusions, though in the new 2015 study, Leslie Webster now dates the cover to [...] "c. 700–c. 730", and Richard Gameson [...] "dates the script to c. 710–c. 730", as quoted above.|$|E
500|$|Initially, both Charlemagne and Offa {{appear to}} have shared a common {{interest}} in supporting King Æthelred, Offa's son-in-law. Shortly before Æthelred was murdered in 796, an embassy from Francia delivered gifts for the king and his bishops. When Charlemagne learned of Æthelred's killing he was enraged, called the Northumbrians [...] "that treacherous, perverse people...who murder their own lords", and threatened retribution. His ambassadors, who had travelled on to Ireland and were then returning home, were ordered back to Northumbria to recover the presents. Charlemagne in time became a supporter of Eardwulf. Eardwulf is said by the early 12th-century Annals of Lindisfarne and Durham to have married one of Charlemagne's daughters, information not found in other sources. [...] <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>correct</b> {{she must have been}} illegitimate, as the marriages of all the legitimate daughters are known. Coenwulf, on the other hand, who became king of Mercia shortly after Eardwulf's accession, is recorded as having fought with Eardwulf in 801.|$|E
500|$|The {{analyses}} {{described above}} concluded that sponges are {{closest to the}} ancestors of all Metazoa, of all multi-celled animals including both sponges and more complex groups. However, another comparison in 2008 of 150 genes in each of 21 genera, ranging from fungi to humans but including only two species of sponge, suggested that comb jellies (ctenophora) are the most basal lineage of the Metazoa included in the sample. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>correct,</b> either modern comb jellies developed their complex structures independently of other Metazoa, or sponges' ancestors were more complex and all known sponges are drastically simplified forms. The study recommended further analyses using {{a wider range of}} sponges and other simple Metazoa such as Placozoa. The results of such an analysis, published in 2009, suggest that a return to the previous view may be warranted. [...] 'Family trees' constructed using a combination of all available data – morphological, developmental and molecular – concluded that the sponges are in fact a monophyletic group, and with the cnidarians form the sister group to the bilaterians.|$|E

500|$|It is {{difficult}} to fit chancelloriids into classifications of sponges or more complex animals. An analysis in 1996 concluded that they were closely related to sponges {{on the grounds that}} the detailed structure of chancellorid sclerites ("armor plates") is similar to that of fibers of spongin, a collagen protein, in [...] modern keratose (horny) demosponges such as Darwinella. However another analysis in 2002 concluded that chancelloriids are not sponges and may be intermediate between sponges and more complex animals, among other reasons because their skins were thicker and more tightly connected than those of sponges. In 2008 a detailed analysis of chancelloriids' sclerites concluded that they were very similar to those of halkieriids, mobile bilaterian animals that looked like slugs in chain mail and whose fossils are found in rocks from the very Early Cambrian to the Mid Cambrian. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>correct,</b> it would create a dilemma, as it is extremely unlikely that totally unrelated organisms could have developed such similar sclerites independently, but the huge difference in the structures of their bodies makes it hard to see how they could be closely related.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the species}} is widely distributed, it is locally rare in all regions, making fossas {{particularly}} vulnerable to extinction. The effects of habitat fragmentation increase the risk. For its size, the fossa has a lower than predicted population density, which is further threatened by Madagascar's rapidly disappearing forests and dwindling lemur populations, which make up {{a high proportion of}} its diet. The loss of the fossa, either locally or completely, could significantly impact ecosystem dynamics, possibly leading to over-grazing by some of its prey species. The total population of the fossa living within protected areas is estimated at less than 2,500adults, but this may be an overestimate. Only two protected areas are thought to contain 500 or more adult fossas: Masoala National Park and Midongy-Sud National Park, although these are also thought to be overestimated. Too little population information has been collected for a formal population viability analysis, but estimates suggest that none of the protected areas support a viable population. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>correct,</b> the extinction of the fossa may take as much as 100years to occur as the species gradually declines. In order for the species to survive, it is estimated that at least [...] is needed to maintain smaller, short-term viable populations, and at least [...] for populations of 500 adults.|$|E
500|$|Kells Abbey was plundered and pillaged by Vikings {{many times}} in the 10th century, and how the book survived is not known. The {{earliest}} historical reference to the book, and indeed to the book's presence at Kells, {{can be found in a}} 1007 entry in the Annals of Ulster. This entry records that [...] "the great Gospel of Columkille, (Columba) the chief relic of the Western World, was wickedly stolen during the night from the western sacristy of the great stone church at Cenannas on account of its wrought shrine". The manuscript was recovered a few months later—minus its golden and bejewelled cover—"under a sod". It is generally assumed that the [...] "great Gospel of Columkille" [...] is the Book of Kells. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>correct,</b> then the book was in Kells by 1007 and had been there long enough for thieves to learn of its presence. The force of ripping the manuscript free from its cover may account for the folios missing from the beginning and end of the Book of Kells. The description in the Annals of the book as [...] "of Columkille"—that is, having belonged to, and perhaps being made by Columba—suggests that the book was believed at that time to have been made on Iona.|$|E

500|$|Harald's son Magnus had {{previously}} been involved in Gruffydd ap Llywelyn's 1058 war against the English king with a Norwegian fleet, possibly indicating that Harald had tested the situation in England long before his 1066 invasion, {{only to find that}} he could not simultaneously be at war with Denmark and England. After Edward's death, Harald allied himself with Tostig Godwinson, Harold's brother, who had been deprived of the earldom of Northumbria by Edward in 1065. According to various sources, Tostig may have asked both or either of William of Normandy and Sweyn Estridsson to assist him in invading England before turning to Harald. According to the sagas, Tostig finally pledged his support for Harald, including that of the [...] "majority of the chieftains", at a meeting in Norway. Some historians doubt that this meeting took place, as William of Malmesbury claims that Tostig did not pledge his support for Harald until they met at the Humber. This would indicate that the invasion originally was Harald's plan alone, and that his joining of forces with Tostig was merely a later agreement when the two {{met for the first time}} in Scotland or Northumbria. Another proposal by historians is that a meeting did indeed take place in Norway, but instead with Copsig, one of Tostig's early supporters and a fellow exile, as Tostig's mediator. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>correct,</b> it would both allow an agreement to have been made in Norway, and the first personal meeting between Harald and Tostig to have taken place in Britain.

Antonico is known to have been succeeded by his nephew, Juan de Contreras; Worth argues that Juan's mother (and Antonico's sister) was the chief of [...] "San Antonio" [...] who visited St. Augustine with Antonico in 1598. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>correct,</b> and if this female chief's San Antonio can be identified as San Antonio de Enacape, Juan may have moved {{the administrative}} center due to his filial connections to Enacape. The Agua Dulce chiefdom declined even further through the 17th century, and as it could no longer support a mission province, it was eventually merged into the Timucua Province. San Antonio de Enacape appears in mission lists from 1655 and 1680, but by the later date it was occupied by Yamassee refugees.
