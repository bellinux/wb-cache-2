25|$|The <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>polymers</b> to form smaller {{molecules}} may proceed {{by random}} scission or specific scission. The degradation of polyethylene occurs by random scission—a random breakage of the bonds {{that hold the}} atoms of the polymer together. When heated above 450°C, polyethylene degrades to form a mixture of hydrocarbons. Other polymers, such as poly(alpha-methylstyrene), undergo specific chain scission with breakage occurring only at the ends. They literally unzip or depolymerize back to the constituent monomer.|$|E

500|$|They {{are widely}} used to prevent the {{oxidative}} <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>polymers</b> such as rubbers, plastics and adhesives that causes a loss of strength and flexibility in these materials. Polymers containing double bonds in their main chains, such as natural rubber and polybutadiene, are especially susceptible to oxidation and ozonolysis. They can be protected by antiozonants. Solid polymer products start to crack on exposed surfaces as the material degrades and the chains break. The mode of cracking varies between oxygen and ozone attack, the former causing a [...] "crazy paving" [...] effect, while ozone attack produces deeper cracks aligned {{at right angles to}} the tensile strain in the product. [...] Oxidation and UV degradation are also frequently linked, mainly because UV radiation creates free radicals by bond breakage. The free radicals then react with oxygen to produce peroxy radicals which cause yet further damage, often in a chain reaction. Other polymers susceptible to oxidation include polypropylene and polyethylene. The former is more sensitive owing to the presence of secondary carbon atoms present in every repeat unit. Attack occurs at this point because the free radical formed is more stable than one formed on a primary carbon atom. Oxidation of polyethylene tends to occur at weak links in the chain, such as branch points in low-density polyethylene.|$|E

2500|$|DSC is used widely for {{examining}} polymeric materials {{to determine their}} thermal transitions. [...] The observed thermal transitions can be utilized to compare materials, although the transitions do not uniquely identify composition. The composition of unknown materials may be completed using complementary techniques such as IR spectroscopy. [...] Melting points and glass transition temperatures for most polymers are available from standard compilations, and the method can show polymer degradation by the lowering of the expected melting point, Tm, for example. Tm depends on the molecular weight of the polymer and thermal history, so lower grades may have lower melting points than expected. The percent crystalline content of a polymer can be estimated from the crystallization/melting peaks of the DSC graph as reference heats of fusion {{can be found in}} the literature. DSC can also be used to study thermal <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>polymers</b> using an approach such as Oxidative Onset Temperature/Time (OOT), however, the user risks contamination of the DSC cell, which can be problematic. [...] Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) may be more useful for decomposition behavior determination. [...] Impurities in polymers can be determined by examining thermograms for anomalous peaks, and plasticisers can be detected at their characteristic boiling points. [...] In addition, examination of minor events in first heat thermal analysis data can be useful as these apparently [...] "anomalous peaks" [...] can in fact also be representative of process or storage thermal history of the material or polymer physical aging. Comparison of first and second heat data collected at consistent heating rates can allow the analyst to learn about both polymer processing history and material properties.|$|E

50|$|In a {{finished}} product, {{such a change}} is to be prevented or delayed. Failure of safety-critical polymer components can cause serious accidents, such as fire {{in the case of}} cracked and degraded polymer fuel lines. Chlorine-induced cracking of acetal resin plumbing joints and polybutylene pipes has caused many serious floods in domestic properties, especially in the USA in the 1990s. Traces of chlorine in the water supply attacked vulnerable polymers in the plastic plumbing, a problem which occurs faster if any of the parts have been poorly extruded or injection molded. Attack of the acetal joint occurred because of faulty molding, leading to cracking along the threads of the fitting which is a serious stress concentration.Polymer oxidation has caused accidents involving medical devices.

50|$|Thermal <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>polymers</b> is {{molecular}} deterioration as {{a result}} of overheating. At high temperatures the components of the long chain backbone of the polymer can begin to be broken (chain scission) and react with one another to change the properties of the polymer. Thermal degradation can present an upper limit to the service temperature of plastics as much as the possibility of mechanical property loss. Indeed unless correctly prevented, significant thermal degradation can occur at temperatures much lower than those at which mechanical failure is likely to occur. The chemical reactions involved in thermal degradation lead to physical and optical property changes relative to the initially specified properties. Thermal degradation generally involves changes to the molecular weight (and molecular weight distribution) of the polymer and typical property changes include reduced ductility and embrittlement, chalking, color changes, cracking, general reduction in most other desirable physical properties. Thermal breakdown products may include a complex mixture of compounds, including but not limited to carbon monoxide, ammonia, aliphatic amines, ketones, nitriles, and hydrogen cyanide, which may be flammable, toxic and/or irritating. The specific materials generated will vary depending on the additives and colorants used, specific temperature, time of exposure and other immediate environmental factors.|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: Epoxy-glass composites were subjected to oscillatory bending loadings withconstant deflection. During fatigue procedure the force needed to achieve constant deflection was measured. During fatigue tests samples were subjected to ultrasonic tests. Additionally before fatigue test and after 300000, 850 000 and 1 900 000 cycles parts of samples were subjected to destructive bending test. Findings: A good correlation between velocity of ultrasonic wave propagation and the degree of strengthdegradation of epoxy-glass composites caused by fatigue was found.
