25|$|All {{white blood}} cells (WBCs) are known as leukocytes. Leukocytes differ from other cells {{of the body in}} that they are not tightly {{associated}} with a particular organ or tissue; thus, their function {{is similar to that of}} independent, single-cell organisms. Leukocytes are able to move freely and interact with and capture cellular debris, <b>foreign</b> <b>particles,</b> and invading microorganisms. Unlike many other cells in the body, most innate immune leukocytes cannot divide or reproduce on their own, but are the products of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells present in the bone marrow.|$|E
25|$|The {{thought that}} the {{mammalian}} body must have some way of identifying introduced <b>foreign</b> <b>particles</b> first arose during World War II. Numerous theories were proposed and it wasn't until 1958 that {{the first of these}} identifying proteins was found. The first standardized naming system was established in 1968 by the WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System. HLA research didn't heat up until the 1980s when a group of researchers finally elucidated the shape of the HLA-A*02 protein (just one of many specific HLA proteins). Even more recently, in 2010, the WHO committee responsible for naming all HLA proteins revised their standards for naming to introduce more clarity and specificity in the naming system. It started with a plane crash in the height of the London Blitz. The pilot suffered severe burns requiring skin grafts. However, at the time skin grafts were a risky business, often being rejected for unknown reasons. The search for a reason spanned the next four decades and in some areas is still continuing today.|$|E

25|$|Atypical {{hemolytic}} uremic syndrome (aHUS) is {{an extremely}} rare, life-threatening, progressive disease that frequently has a genetic component. In most cases it is caused by chronic, uncontrolled activation of the complement system, {{a branch of the}} body’s immune system that destroys and removes <b>foreign</b> <b>particles.</b> The disease affects both children and adults and is characterized by systemic thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, which can lead to stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, and death. The complement system activation may be due to mutations in the complement regulatory proteins (factor H, factor I, or membrane cofactor protein), or is occasionally due to acquired neutralizing autoantibody inhibitors of these complement system components, for example anti–factor H antibodies. Despite the use of supportive care, historically an estimated 33–40% of patients died or developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with the first clinical bout of aHUS. Including subsequent relapses, a total of approximately two-thirds (65%) of patients died, required dialysis, or had permanent renal damage within the first year after diagnosis despite plasma exchange or plasma infusion (PE/PI).|$|E

50|$|Thus, {{the crystal}} face must grow as a whole. The {{growth rate of}} the entire face is {{determined}} by the driving force (level of supersaturation) at the point of emergence of the predominant point of growth (e.g. a dislocation, a <b>foreign</b> <b>particle</b> acting as catalyst, or crystal twin).

40|$|In {{a liquid}} {{fluidised}} bed system, {{the motion of}} each phase is governed by fluid-particle and particle-particle interactions. The particle-particle collisions can significantly affect the motion of individual particles and hence the solid-liquid two phase flow characteristics. In the current work, computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) simulations of a dense <b>foreign</b> <b>particle</b> introduced in a monodispersed solid-liquid fluidised bed (SLFB) have been carried out. The fluidisation hydrodynamics of SLFB, settling behaviour of the <b>foreign</b> <b>particle,</b> fluid-particle interactions, and particle-particle collision behaviour have been investigated. Experiments including particle classification velocity measurements and fluid turbulence characterisation by particle image velocimetry (PIV) were conducted for the validation of prediction results. Compared to those predicted by empirical correlations, the particle classification velocity predicted by CFD-DEM provided the best agreement with the experimental data (less than 10 % deviation). The particle collision frequency increased monotonically with the solid fraction. The dimensionless collision frequency obtained by CFD-DEM excellently fit the data line predicted by the kinetic theory for granular flow (KTGF). The particle collision frequency increased with the particle size ratio (d P 2 /d P 1) and became independent of the <b>foreign</b> <b>particle</b> size for high solid fractions when the fluidised particle size was kept constant. The magnitude of collision force was 10 - 50 times {{greater than that of}} gravitational force and maximally 9 times greater than that of drag force. A correlation describing the collision force as a function of bed voidage was developed for St p > 65 and d P 2 /d P 1 ≤ 2.

500|$|Phagocytes are {{cells that}} protect the body by ingesting harmful <b>foreign</b> <b>particles,</b> bacteria, and dead or dying cells.

They are essential for fighting infections and for subsequent immunity. Phagocytes are important throughout the animal kingdom and are highly developed within vertebrates. One litre of human blood contains about six billion phagocytes. They were discovered in 1882 by Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov while he was studying starfish larvae. Mechnikov was awarded the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery.

Observations on films formed from clay–polymer blends indicate that particulate additives,in addition to serving as nucleating agents, may also perturb crystal growth, leading to the formation of irregular dendritic morphologies 2, 3. Here we describe the formation of these ‘dizzy dendrites’using a phase-field theory,in which randomly distributed <b>foreign</b> <b>particle</b> inclusions perturb the crystallization by deflecting the tips of the growing dendrite arms. This mechanism of crystallization, which is verified experimentally, leads to a polycrystalline structure dependent on particle configuration and orientation.
