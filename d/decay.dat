5|$|A 2016 {{calculation}} of the half-lives of the isotopes of unbiunium from 290Ubu to 339Ubu suggested that those from 290Ubu to 303Ubu would not be bound and would <b>decay</b> through proton emission, those from 304Ubu through 314Ubu would undergo alpha <b>decay,</b> and those from 315Ubu to 339Ubu would undergo spontaneous fission. Only the isotopes from 309Ubu to 314Ubu would have long enough alpha-decay lifetimes to be detected in laboratories, starting <b>decay</b> chains terminating in spontaneous fission at moscovium, tennessine, or ununennium. This would present a grave problem for experiments aiming at synthesising isotopes of unbiunium if true, because the isotopes whose alpha <b>decay</b> could be observed {{could not be reached}} by any presently usable combination of target and projectile. Calculations in 2016 and 2017 by the same authors on elements 123 and 125 suggest a less bleak outcome, with alpha <b>decay</b> chains from the more reachable nuclides 300–307Ubt leading down to bohrium or nihonium; in particular, 304Ubt could be synthesised in the reaction 249Bk(58Fe,3n)304Ubt and would alpha <b>decay</b> through 300Ubu, 296Uue, and 292Ts to the known 288Mc and 284Nh, though the cross-section would likely be extremely low. It has also been suggested that cluster <b>decay</b> might be a significant <b>decay</b> mode in competition with alpha <b>decay</b> and spontaneous fission in the region past Z = 120, which would pose yet another hurdle for experimental identification of these nuclides.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} stable isotopes, {{which make up}} almost all lead that exists naturally, there are trace {{quantities}} of a few radioactive isotopes. One of them is lead-210; although it has a half-life of only 22.3 years, small quantities occur in nature because lead-210 is produced by a long <b>decay</b> series that starts with uranium-238 (which has been present for billions of years on Earth). Lead-211, -212, and -214 {{are present in the}} <b>decay</b> chains of uranium-235, thorium-232, and uranium-238, respectively, so traces of all three of these lead isotopes are found naturally. Minute traces of lead-209 arise from the very rare cluster <b>decay</b> of radium-223, one of the daughter products of natural uranium-235.

5|$|Astatine's alpha <b>decay</b> {{energies}} {{follow the}} same trend as for other heavy elements. Lighter astatine isotopes have quite high energies of alpha <b>decay,</b> which become lower as the nuclei become heavier. Astatine-211 has a significantly higher energy than the previous isotope, {{because it has a}} nucleus with 126 neutrons, and 126 is a magic number corresponding to a filled neutron shell. Despite having a similar half-life to the previous isotope (8.1hours for astatine-210 and 7.2hours for astatine-211), the alpha <b>decay</b> probability is much higher for the latter: 41.81% against only 0.18%. The two following isotopes release even more energy, with astatine-213 releasing the most energy. For this reason, it is the shortest-lived astatine isotope. Even though heavier astatine isotopes release less energy, no long-lived astatine isotope exists, because of the increasing role of beta <b>decay</b> (electron emission). This <b>decay</b> mode is especially important for astatine; as early as 1950 it was postulated that all isotopes of the element undergo beta <b>decay.</b> Beta <b>decay</b> modes have been found for all astatine isotopes except astatine-213, -214, -215, and -216m. Astatine-210 and lighter isotopes exhibit beta plus <b>decay</b> (positron emission), astatine-216 and heavier isotopes exhibit beta (minus) <b>decay,</b> and astatine-212 decays via both modes, while astatine-211 undergoes electron capture.|$|E
