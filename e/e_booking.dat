40|$|In {{light of}} the fact that {{information}} communication technologies (ICTs) in general and the Internet/ WWW technology in particular are likely to soon accelerate penetration into the maritime market, bringing together innovative services, this article aims to identify a set of appealing Web-based services for ship travelers. To that end, the article uses a research methodology that includes three core research elements (i. e., Internet survey, questionnaires, and interviews). Our research highlights five state-of-the-art Web-based services (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>booking,</b> schedule information, ship location, trip/port weather, and tourist information) that can be implemented by maritime transport operators (MTOs) and travel agencies (TAs). The added value nature of the proposed services could guarantee to their prospective implementers significant commercial advantages against their competitors. Demonstrating this business opportunity for MTOs and TAs, the article contributes towards the formation of new business models, which take into account the emerging maritime e-market...|$|E

40|$|Social {{media are}} playing an {{increasingly}} important role as information resource in tourism both for customers (i. e the tourists), who gather trustworthy information from peers supporting the choice of destinations and services, and for businesses which may use the same information for improving their product supply. However, the use of social media data also offer new opportunities for transparent and democratic decisions support in tourism planning. According to Benitez et al. (2007) tourists are an important target audience for urban planning: with {{better understanding of the}} motivations of tourists and tailoring provision accordingly, decision making can be facilitated by emphasizing the strengths of destination for past and potential visitors. In addition, information related to tourists’ perceptions and opinion is not analysed yet by planners. The success of a tourist destination depends mainly of factors related to both the location and the services that the local industry may offer (Crouch et all, 2004). Therefore, understanding the user satisfaction to this respect may offer valuable information in tourism planning both at the local and regional levels. In the light of the above premises, the goal on the study presented in this paper is to prupose an integrated approach to investigate the relationships among tourists’ satisfaction, destination resources and tourism industry for regional tourism planning. The methodology developed in the study includes data collection from popular tourism social media platforms (i. <b>e.</b> <b>booking.</b> com and tripadvisor. com), and their integration with territorial and tourism data.

40|$|Our {{contribution}} {{concerns the}} use of Social Media Geographic Information (SMGI) as an emergent pluralist source of information which may find valuable application in spatial planning and Geodesign. On the base of empirical research, the authors propose a tentative framework for SMGI Analytics in spatial planning. Among other methods, Spatial-Temporal Textual Analysis (STTx) is proposed {{as a tool to}} investigate people perceptions and interest in space and time. Possible implications and benefits of SMGI analytics for the planning practice emerge from the overall discussion. The results proposed in this contribution concern three main research streams carried on by the authors with the common feature of integrating social media and other volunteered sources of information with authoritative sources of information found in Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) for decision-making support in spatial planning. The case-studies are carried-on in the Sardinia Region in Italy. The first case study deals with {{the use of}} a geographic social media platform called Place, I care! Developed by the authors. PIC is a SMGI platform which allows users to register to a project and publish and interact with SMGI in a geo-browser wherein the working space is an interactive map. A pilot project called Cagliari, I care! 2. 0 (CIC 2. 0) was set-up asking the participants to spot and report issues of appreciation and/or concern from an environmental, social, or cultural perspective in Cagliari, Italy. In PIC each post is a multimedia placemark wherein the user can attach textual descriptions, pictures, video or audio clip. The purpose of the pilot was not only to stimulate the participation to an online map-based dialogue, but also to develop a novel analytics to be applied to the information stemming from the discussion among the participants with other applications and tools in order to understand possible ways to extract useful knowledge for planning support. It should be noted that the term analytics, often related to analysis of big data, recently emerged as an integrated framework of different analysis enabling knowledge building and decision-making support. In this sense we may refer here to SMGI analytics in planning, meaning the extraction of useful knowledge for spatial planning and decision-making. The potential of SMGI is then to express a pluralist view of reality supporting the discourse according to the most recent paradigm in communicative planning. The second research stream carried on by the authors deals with the role of SMGI is playing as an information resource in tourism both for customers (i. e. the tourists), who gather trustworthy information supporting the choice of destinations and services from peers, and for businesses, which can use the same information for improving their marketing strategies. The use of social media data can also offer new opportunities for decision-support in tourism planning. With improved understanding of the motivations of tourists and tailoring tourism service supply, decision making can be facilitated by emphasizing the strengths of tourist destinations for past and potential visitors. However, this kind of information about tourists perceptions and opinions is not always properly analysed by planners. Understanding the user satisfaction, which depends on factors related to both the location and the services that the local industry proposes, may offer valuable information in tourism planning at regional and local level.

The methodology developed in the study includes data collection from popular tourism social media platforms (i. <b>e.</b> <b>Booking.</b> com and TripAdvisor. com. com), and their integration with territorial and tourism data. Spatial and statistical analysis techniques are then applied to elicit insights from tourists perceptions on success factors which may be used in decision-making and planning support. The case study demonstrates the value of social media data and computational social science techniques in tourism planning. A critical discussion on the potential of using such an approach in more general urban and regional planning setting is also given in this contribution. The third research work reported in this contribution further investigate the opportunities of Social Media Geographic Information (SMGI) as valuable support for analysis, design and decision-making in urban and regional planning. To this end, an original user-friendly tool developed by the authors is presented, which is able to extract information from popular Social Media such as Twitter. com and Youtube. com from a GIS application and to apply Spatial-Temporal Textual (STTx) analysis. The Spatext STTx suite is implemented as add-in for ESRI ArcGIS©. It includes a suite of tools, which can be used to achieve three main goals for analysis: (1) social media data retrieval from Twitter and YouTube, (2) data geocoding, and (3) spatial-temporal analysis of textual content. The coupling of Spatext functionalities with standardGIS spatial analysis tools can ease the integration of SMGI with authorative data, for analysis, design and support of decision-making in urban and regional planning. Two case-studies concerning natural protected areas planning and management, and cultural heritage conservation are under development by the authors in order to demonstrate at the regional and at the local scale the potential of SMGI analytics in regional and urban planning. The objective is to show how SMGI analytics can support design, analysis and decision making in planning, and add the value of pluralism to democratic decision-making. The contribution ends with a summary on the opportunities of SMGI analytics for possibly affecting the decision-making process in urban and regional planning and Geodesign. ...|$|E

A framework for the application of the model is also described, employing three different types of agents within a building: personal agents, building agents and a facilitator, which is mediating between the former agents to satisfy the needs of their human owners. Although the agents have different tasks and complexity, it is demonstrated that the presented model can be used for each of the various agents in a unified manner by taking advantage of the modularity of the model. An example application shows how the proposed agent typology can be applied to building automation so that both real-time tasks (e. g. negotiating the temperature of a room) and planning tasks (<b>e.</b> g. <b>booking</b> and customizing a room including a fee for service) can be realized.

Although previous approaches exist, they are often restricted to specific domains (<b>e.</b> g., <b>booking</b> an airline ticket) and require hand-crafted rules. In this paper, we present a simple approach for this task which uses the recently proposed sequence to sequence framework. Our model converses by predicting the next sentence given the previous sentence or sentences in a conversation. The strength of our model {{is that it can}} be trained end-to-end and thus requires much fewer hand-crafted rules. We find that this straightforward model can generate simple conversations given a large conversational training dataset. Our preliminary results suggest that, despite optimizing the wrong objective function, the model is able to converse well. It is able extract knowledge from both a domain specific dataset, and from a large, noisy, and general domain dataset of movie subtitles. On a domain-specific IT helpdesk dataset, the model can find a solution to a technical problem via conversations. On a noisy open-domain movie transcript dataset, the model can perform simple forms of common sense reasoning. As expected, we also find that the lack of consistency is a common failure mode of our model. Comment: ICML Deep Learning Workshop 201...|$|R

40|$|User data is siloed {{in mobile}} apps today. Where one app {{may hold the}} user’s flight booking, another app the user’s cab reservation, with little data sharing between the two, {{resulting}} in a fragmented user experience. For instance, if a user, who has just booked a flight using one app, wishes to pre-book a cab from the airport, {{they would have to}} do so by manually re-entering the data from the flight app (e. g., location, date, time) into the cab app. To enable the user to retake control of their in-app data, the Insider platform extracts structured user data from the presentation layer of arbitrary apps, without any modifica-tions to the app code or binary, and makes it easy for such data to be shared across apps, when the user so desires. At its core, ordinary users create and share models for the apps they care about; the app model relates the data from the pre-sentation layer of the app to attributes in a task template, which corresponds to the specific tasks users perform in the app (<b>e.</b> g., <b>booking</b> a flight). At runtime, Insider combines the app model with the raw stream from the presentation layer to produce structured and semantically-meaningful informa-tion. Insider then publishes this information through a set of APIs, enabling creation of novel apps that could not have been built previously. For example, we prototype the auto-matic population of information in a cab app after a flight booking as well as three other such novel apps that rely on cross-app data sharing. Finally, we report on a detailed eval-uation of running Insider on 150 apps across 11 categories. We show that we are able to successfully extract 83 % of the key attributes (e. g., UI widget corresponding to source airport) from these apps. Further, we also track app version changes during a 6 month period from Sep 2014 to Mar 2015 and find that even though 40 % of apps were updated, only 6 % of apps required rebuilding of the app model. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{usage of}} distributed systems {{has led to}} the problem of integration of IT systems that communicate via different protocols. In such setting, it is also typical for these components to be added/removed from the system at runtime, depending on requirements. These two characteristics give rise to integration challenges where systems should be able to communicate seamlessly with each other whilst being able to be easily integrated with an existing distributed system with minimal impact. An ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) is a tool which attempts to address the above issues by integrating systems in a bus-like architecture where a central bus enables components to communicate via messages. This arrangement, transparently handling complex messaging functions such as transformation and routing (via routing patterns), enables the user to focus on the business logic, abstracting away communication concerns [6]. Despite facilitating orchestration of distributed components in a scalable manner, current ESBs provide little support for correctness guarantees of the overall system logic <b>e.</b> g. a <b>booking</b> component may only confirm the booking once the bank component has verified the payment details, and the airline component confirms that the dates specified are permissible. Popular techniques for ensuring correctness, such as testing and model checking are not ideal for verifying the correctness of ESB systems due to the latter’s highly dynamic nature. For this reason, we propose to apply runtime verification techniques, promising a scalable approach to checking all observed behaviour under any runtime circumstance — no matter how unpredictable this may be. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The new {{possibilities}} offered by information & communication technologies (ICTs) within the work-place and elsewhere have attracted wide attention by {{economic and social}} actors. One outcome is the institutional ‘push’ for all businesses to embrace these technologies and ‘get online’. However, {{it is evident that}} take-up amongst businesses has been highly uneven with some cautious in their adoption and, thus, many have not fully exploited the possibilities offered. To understand this variety in the adoption and use of online technologies (which in some cases includes their nonadoption and non-use) it is necessary to examine practices and establish underlying dynamics surrounding new forms of ICTs. This thesis will investigate the practices associated with the adoption and use of ICTs in the hotel industry. Three basic questions are addressed. The first relates the online practices of hoteliers, including the use of online intermediary services, the nature of uptake and the implications for both practices and relations with customers. The second relates to any externalities which condition a hotelier’s practices. The third is concerned with how to conceptual explain observations – findings. Investigation of these questions has resulted in an empirically rich study. This has involved a multi-method approach that allows online practices to be viewed through different lenses and from an adapted Social Shaping of Technology perspective. The population of Scottish serviced accommodation providers was compiled and used to determine the uptake of online practice. Interviews revealed specific practices. Published material provided insight into contextual issues, particularly those relating to institutional developments. The research shows that there were three principle strategies for the adoption of the new technologies. First, they were embedded by the users themselves (‘internalisation’) – often through much effort and processes of configuration – into their ‘busy day’. The process of ‘learning’ (or learning by trying) was found to be an integral feature of uptake. Secondly, some users opted for an alternative solution where, rather than design their own website, they adopted the offerings of online intermediaries (such as online booking facilities) (‘intermediation’). However, the appropriation of online intermediation was found to be both costly and fraught with new kinds of risks (<b>e.</b> g. double <b>bookings)</b> and uncertainty (<b>e.</b> g. no guarantees of bookings). Thirdly, a further option (‘localisation’) was for local groups of hoteliers to collectively produce an online presence that promotes the locality and thereby indirectly provides benefits to their businesses. The analysis was performed using a modified version of Silverstone’s (1992) ‘domestication’ framework. However, ‘localisation’ questioned the assumptions underpinning ‘domestication’, suggesting the need for a more sophisticated analytical device, such as offered by the metaphor of ‘tailoring’. It is concluded that the apparently deterministic institutional view of the benefit of online technologies and the imperative that they are fully exploited to give competitive advantage, can be at odds with the locally contingent and diverse nature of online practices. The research found that the new online practices did not entirely replace traditional ones, but emerged as complementary to them...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) For all individuals, {{the domains}} of mental, {{physical}} and social health are critical to the human experience, and are as such, interwoven into an individual’s personal and societal roles. Over the last decade, government and public policy bodies have become attuned to the importance and influence of mental functioning and its interconnectedness with physical and social outcomes, as well as health and well-being outcomes at an individual, community and national platforms (Herman et al., 2005; WHO, 2011). At a macro level, mental disorders affect 450 million (14 %) individuals worldwide (CDC, 2011; WHO, 2009) and is consequently regarded as {{the leading cause of}} disability adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide, accounting for 37 % of healthy years lost (WHO, 2011). Given the prevalence of mental health disorders amongst the global population, it is foreseeable that the burden of mental illness impacts the well-being of an individual’s (emotional, social, cognitive and financial) abilities (Lourey et al., 2013) and the abilities of collectives (CDC, 2011; WHO, 2011). However, a critical challenge faced in the mental health service sector, is the perpetual and increasing service adoption gap for psychological treatment amongst young consumers suffering from mental health disorders, necessitating the need for radical marketing approaches and thinking. Consequently, researchers in diverse areas such as service and health management have identified the need for more theoretical and empirical elaboration on the mechanisms that influence consumers’ adoption of transformative mental health services. In closing this research gap, this thesis addresses the following research question: “What are the key mechanisms influencing young adults adoption of a transformative services instrumental to achieving individual and collective well-being?” Hence, to advance the body of knowledge on sociocultural (i. e. attitudes, self-stigma) service-related and cognitive mechanisms that influence young-adults in the pre-adoption phase of consumer decision making for transformative services in mental health (<b>e.</b> g. <b>booking</b> an appointment with a general practitioner). Against this backdrop, this research programs seeks to (1) identify the key mechanisms influencing young adults’ adoption of transformative mental health services (2) build and extend the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to inform the development of an integrated theoretical framework and (3) empirically test the integrated framework of transformative service adoption in mental health. A two-study mixed method research program was designed to address the following research question. Study One was an exploratory study that analysed semi-structured in-depth interviews with 18 information rich participants who self-reported with feeling worried (i. e. anxious) or low (i. e. mildly depressed) within a 12 -month timeframe; yet, had no prior service experience with mental health services (i. e. psychologist or psychiatrist). A pre-tested pictorial and written vignette was used at the commencement of each of the interviews, due to the sensitive nature of this study. Functioning as a projective-association technique the vignette elicited meaningful perspectives, feelings and behaviours from interviewees. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using NVivo 10 software. The findings from this study provide evidence for the existence of service and individual-based mechanisms in the pre-adoption phase of mental health service adoption amongst young adults. Further, a proposed integrated model of transformative health service adoption and a set of hypotheses were developed based on the findings of Study One, which were further tested in Study Two. Study Two was a large-scale quantitative study that sought to empirically validate the proposed model of transformative health service adoption. An online-survey was administered Australia-wide to young adults in the target audience of 18 -to- 35 year olds via a reputable market research panel. After removing ineligible responses, a total sample size of 710 was achieved. Reliability and validity analysis were conducted on the data, followed by exploratory factor analysis in IBM SPSS v 24. To test the hypothesised path relationships in the proposed model, partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was performed using Smart PLS v. 3. 2. The PLS-SEM output revealed that 25 hypotheses were supported, one hypothesis was partially supported and one hypothesis was non-significant. In addition, post-hoc analysis of the open-ended questions within the survey identified five major themes (awareness, mental health services, stigma help-seeking patterns and survey-related), which provide support to existing empirical research and avenues for future research. Beyond establishing foundational insights into the facilitating and inhibiting mechanisms that influence help-seeking intentions, this study substantially contributes new knowledge on the concepts of expected health service quality (EHSDQ) and transformation expectation from a pre-adoption perspective. The findings are also relevant for practitioners and public policy makers affiliated with mental health intervention programs and focuses on the tailoring of these programs. Consequently, helping to facilitate consumer empowerment and positive group identity when help-seeking for mental health services (i. e. professional psychological treatment) ...|$|R
40|$|The three {{essays in}} this {{dissertation}} deal with un(der) explored challenges for marketing academics and practitioners concerning varying multimedia contexts, including (yet not limited to) self-selection issues, synergies, mediation effects and consistency issues. According to Corcoran (2009), marketing media {{can be classified}} into three categories. First, paid media are third-party channels that firms/brands pay for to leverage. This category mainly consists of advertising, but also entails, e. g., paid search, display ads, pay per click and sponsorships. Second, owned media are channels that the firm/brand creates and controls, with the firm/brand’s website or brochures as the most common examples. Last, earned media are channels through which consumers and the press share a firm/brand’s content, and speak about brands via word of mouth. These media differ from paid and owned media {{in that they are}} entirely initialized by consumers, and thus have to be “earned” by firms/brands. Examples include Facebook comments, Twitter replies, blogs, forums and review websites. Figure 1 shows how the three essays presented in this dissertation fit into the spectrum provided by the POE (paid-owned-earned) media classification. Essay 1, which has been published in the International Journal of Research in Marketing in December 2014, deals solely with paid media and is titled “Billboard and cinema advertising: Missed opportunity or spoiled arms?”. In this essay, we perform a meta-analytic study on the short- and long-run effectiveness of two smaller, less studied advertising media, i. e. billboards and cinema, for 250 + mature CPG brands. While quantifying the effectiveness of these media using advertising elasticities, we correct for the potential bias in these estimates due to the self-section of brands in their media usage. We do not only do this for the two small media, but also for four larger, more traditional advertising media, i. e. TV, radio, newspapers and magazines. Furthermore, we look into the possibility of synergy effects between these larger media {{on the one hand and}} the small media on the other hand. The results of our analysis show that after correcting for self-selection, which turns out to be highly relevant for drawing appropriate conclusions on media effectiveness for the general population of CPG brands, only TV advertising significantly impacts both sales and market share in the long run. Magazine advertising generally leads to primary-market expansion, but does not induce competitive gain, meaning that it tends to improve sales but not market share. The two small media of interest, i. e. billboard and cinema, are spoiled arms for most mature CPG brands, at least from a sales-response (and market-share) point of view. Although this result is a conservative one for cinema advertising, two remarks need to be made on billboard advertising. First, although billboard advertising is ineffective for an average CPG brand, its long-run effect among the subset of users of this medium is significant. Hence, the (small) subset of brands that makes use of this medium appears well-informed (on average) that this medium works for them. Second, a significant long-run synergy effect exists between radio and billboard advertising, indicating that billboard advertising can be useful if it is used together with radio media. However, brands fail to capitalize on this opportunity as the simultaneous use of both media is rare in our data set. In Essay 2, titled “Online user-generated content: The (in) consistency among hotel-rating websites”, our research setting switches from paid to earned media. In this paper, we address the issue that the vast expansion of the Internet has created an extensively large set of platforms on which consumers can share their opinions with each other, and that users of these platforms might get lost in the abundance of information at their disposition. In order to provide consumers with advice on whether they should consult multiple rating websites (i. c. hotel rating websites) to obtain a reliable indicator of quality as perceived by their peers or whether consulting one of the more prominent websites suffices, we perform a consistency analysis on 665 Parisian hotels rated on four of the most popular customer review websites – i. <b>e.</b> TripAdvisor, <b>Booking.</b> com, Expedia and HolidayCheck. The according results provide substantial evidence of the high level of consistency among three of these four platforms. It is, however, important to note that the consistency here lies in corresponding rating behavior and patterns, rather than actual rating scores. Consumers are consequently advised to rely on TripAdvisor’s, Booking. com’s or Expedia’s ratings, although the mean of these scores would improve the reliability performance even further. HolidayCheck, in contrast, shows a relatively low level of consistency with the three other websites. As the drivers behind this discrepancy are unclear, further research on this matter might be called for. While Essays 1 and 2 revolve around multimedia research questions within one media category (i. e., paid or earned media), Essay 3 focuses on a context including two types of media, being paid and owned media. This essay is titled “Media effectiveness in the non-profit entertainment industry”. The objective of this paper is (i) to put in contrast the sales-driving roles of traditional advertising and informational websites, and (ii) to test for a potential mediating or moderating effect of the former media on the latter. We situate this research in a non-profit setting, where marketing accountability is even more pressing than in for-profit industries. Relying on the case of Technopolis, a Belgian science-themed entertainment park, we are able to show how the owned medium, i. e. the informational website, is a much more important attendance driver (and likely at a much lower cost) than both print and radio advertising. As such, our results support the industry claim that owned online media can well become a cost-effective complement for cash-constrained non-profit organizations. Further, our analysis provides no empirical evidence of any mediating or moderating role of print or radio advertising on the consumers’ activity on the informational website. A better alignment of the on- and offline media might thus further improve these media’s effectiveness. In conclusion, besides the academic relevancy of the provided research, the three essays in this dissertation also provide valuable insights for both marketing managers and consumers. First, the examination of advertising-channel effectiveness in the CPG market gives rise to guidelines on budget allocation for start-ups, while it might urge established brands to reevaluate and possibly rethink their current advertising strategy. Also, it brings to light the opportunity of synergistic effects between radio and billboard advertising. Second, our results on website effectiveness and the lack of evidence for its mediating and moderating effect with more traditional media, shows the high potential effect of online media in the marketing strategy and hopefully might serve as a driver for marketing managers to strengthen the alignment between online and offline media. Last, our third paper shows that consumers can rely on most of the major hotel rating websites and that they should accordingly not have to go through an extensive research process across multiple websites to obtain an adequate representation of quality as perceived by their peers. The three essays in this dissertation also open up new paths for future research on POE media. For example, given that we could not find any empirical evidence of a general effectiveness of cinema and billboard advertising on sales and market share, it would be interesting to study their effect on mindset metrics, such as brand recognition or liking. Also, it would be interesting to study the exceptional cases in which these small media do tend to be effective, in order to depict common brand or campaign characteristics that are crucial for the success of billboard or cinema advertising. Furthermore, with our results on media effectiveness in the non-profit industry, which deviate from prior results obtained in the for-profit industry, we hope to stimulate further research on this topic. Last, further research is warranted on the consistency subject of online rating websites. For example, it might be interesting to determine the causes of the differences in rating values across different websites, not only in the hotel industry but also beyond. nrpages: 100 status: publishe...|$|R
