5|$|In 1903, {{a dispute}} between the FVdG and the <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Unions in Berlin led the party {{commission}} to intervene and to sponsor talks aimed at re-unification of the two wings of the German labor movement. At the meeting, the FVdG {{made a number of}} compromises, which led to member protests. Soon, over one-third of the members left the union. The 1903 FVdG congress elected a panel to continue negotiations with the <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Unions. This panel demanded that the <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Unions adopt localist organizational principles as a prerequisite for re-unification. The FVdG panel realized this demand was unrealistic, but hoped the expulsion of revisionists from the SPD during the debate on Eduard Bernstein's theses would strengthen their position. The impossibility of a reconciliation between the two became obvious by March 1904, since the re-unification envisioned by both the leadership of the SPD and the <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Unions was more along the lines of an integration of the FVdG into the <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Unions.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{increased}} emphasis {{has been placed}} on a range of "non-trade" concerns and their implications for the move towards <b>freer</b> <b>trade.</b> We review the basis of several of these concerns, focusing particularly on multifunctionality. The simple view of a fixed proportions relationship between agricultural production and non-commodity outputs, such as landscape amenities, is shown to be untenable. Nevertheless, policies to internalize the effects of multiple externalities and public goods must be selected jointly to account for any interrelationships among them, and/or the market goods from agricultural production. We argue that this requires a shift away from traditional agricultural policies with their commodity orientation, towards a new policy paradigm that has a natural resource focus. We also suggest that this will require a shift in the location of where policy is formed and implemented from the center to the community level. We believe that this change in policy focus would be consistent with the move to <b>freer</b> <b>trade,</b> although some expansion would be needed in the range of policies that are considered permissible under the green box category of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. We argue that major non-trade concerns can be satisfied {{in a way that is}} not inconsistent with <b>freer</b> <b>trade,</b> and that <b>freer</b> <b>trade</b> would not undermine important domestic objectives. agricultural trade, non-trade concerns, multifunctionality, agricultural policy, International Relations/Trade, Q 17,...|$|R

The theoretical and empirical analysis of the impact of <b>freer</b> <b>trade</b> on poverty in the rich and in the poor countries is not symmetric, of course.

In the former case, we treat the resources and technology to be given and then ask: how does <b>freer</b> <b>trade</b> affect poverty in this static framework. In the latter case, we admit growth effects that impact on the state of poverty over time. I: Static Arguments The central effect on poverty is assumed to come from the effects on real wages of the unskilled workers, endowed with labor but no human or financial capital. The natural presumption following the Stolper-Samuelson argumentation, would be that, if anything, <b>freer</b> <b>trade</b> should help in the reduction of poverty in the poor countries which use their comparative advantage to export labor-intensive goods.

5|$|Economic {{globalization}} grew under <b>free</b> <b>trade,</b> {{starting in}} 1860 when the United Kingdom {{entered into a}} <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> agreement with France known as the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty. However, {{the golden age of}} this wave of globalization endured a return to protectionism between 1880 and 1914. In 1879, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced protective tariffs on agricultural and manufacturing goods, making Germany the first nation to institute new protective trade policies. In 1892, France introduced the Méline tariff, greatly raising customs duties on both agricultural and manufacturing goods. The United States maintained strong protectionism during most of the nineteenth century, imposing customs duties between 40 and 50% on imported goods. Despite these measures, international trade continued to grow without slowing. Paradoxically, foreign trade grew at a much faster rate during the protectionist phase of the first wave of globalization than during the <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> phase sparked by the United Kingdom.|$|E
