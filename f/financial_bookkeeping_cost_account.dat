40|$|This {{paper is}} to show clearly the real image of German <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> at the {{beginning}} of the 20 th century. A. Messerschmitt and E. Schmalenbach played important roll in the establishment of German <b>cost</b> <b>accounting.</b> Messerschmitt worked as an engineer and a factory manager (entrepreneur). Messerschmitt expressed almost all cost elements as the percentage of labor costs in order to estimate unit product costs. On the other hand, Schmalenbach was an eminent scholar in German Accounting Theory (Betriebswirtschaftslehre). In the 1899 's article that Schmalenbach explained his own thinking process on factory <b>bookkeeping</b> and <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> under his practical experiences, he discussed problems concerning recognition, measurement and allocation of fixed overhead costs. The idea of product costing (Kalkulation) was on the rise in Germany during late 19 th century and early 20 th century. They attempted to reconsider this conventional allocation method of indirect costs in order to report more accurate product costs. 1 ?. Schmalenbach's <b>Cost</b> <b>Accounting</b> Theor...|$|R
40|$|The present {{standard}} for calculating costs on family farms {{is dependent on}} a method of calculating the production cost of agricultural products provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. This cost is the so-called "social production cost", {{which is based on}} a concept of economics. It is not suitable for individual farm level <b>costing</b> <b>accounting.</b> Generally speaking most of the farmers do not practice <b>bookkeeping</b> with a <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> system. <b>Cost</b> is calculated outside the books. In such cases farmers calculate various kinds of costs. Take labor cost for instance. It would be more accurate to base labor on the cost of living on a family farm, rather than on the pre-vailing wage. The growth of book-keeping with a <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> system is limited, especially in diversified farms. Nevertheless, the growing popularity of personal computers, improvement in software and the increased participation of women in bookkeeping will all {{play an important role in}} the growth of an authorized <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> system...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} aimed at systematization and {{development}} of a cost typology for the logistics and supplying activities of enterprises, {{as well as providing}} the substantive characteristics of each type of such costs. It has been substantiated that understanding varieties of costs of the logistics and supplying activities of enterprises provides the possibility of more efficient control of these costs, careful calculation of self-cost of production, formation of various key indicators of efficiency of management of such costs, identification of alternatives in the sphere of logistics and supplying operations, etc. The cost typology for the logistics and supplying activities of enterprises, provided in the article, differs from others in that the typology attributes are allocated from the position of the possibility for clear allocation and consideration of each kind of such costs (by means of the bookkeeping and managerial accounting). The provided generalized typology of kinds of costs of enterprises in terms of their logistics and supplying activities is stipulated not only by the need for more accurate management of these, but also by the possibility of their detailed analyzing as well as diagnosing with purpose of an optimization. Prospects for further research in this direction will be improving the instrumentarium of both the <b>bookkeeping</b> and managerial <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> of the logistics and supplying activities...|$|R

5000|$|The best {{method of}} <b>financial</b> <b>bookkeeping,</b> one that admits of perfect balancing, {{should always be}} adopted {{but this does not}} debar such {{variations}} as will fit it for the business to which it relates, or the special requirements of the proprietor or manager. There is no insuperable difficulty in making these variations if the staff be properly trained. The great difference between the professional accountant and his clerks, and ordinary commercial bookkeepers is that the former are trained to think, whereas the latter are taught, and often only permitted, to slavishly follow example. Yet alike in methods of bookkeeping, in formation of <b>cost</b> <b>accounts,</b> in details of office arrangements, in management of men, and in distribution of profits, there must be such variations as will fit those methods to the peculiar circumstances of the individual firm. There must, on the one hand, be no want of system, no imperfect recording of accounts or statistics and on the other there must be no sacrifice of the substance to the shadow : no abandonment of necessary particulars to the fanciful exigency of interlocking them with a balance-sheet.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{push for}} {{interactive}} global illumination (GI) has established the 4 -ary bounding volume hierarchy (BVH 4) {{as a highly}} efficient acceleration structure for incoherent ray queries with single rays. Ray stream techniques augment the fast single-ray traversal with increased utilization of CPU vector units and leverage memory bandwidth for batches of rays. Despite their success, the proposed implementations suffer from high <b>bookkeeping</b> <b>cost</b> and batch fragmentation, especially for small batch sizes. Furthermore, due to the focus on incoherent rays, optimization for highly coherent BVH 4 ray queries, such as primary visibility, has received little attention. Our contribution is twofold: For coherent ray sets, we introduce a large packet traversal tailored to the BVH 4 that is faster than the original BVH 2 variant, and for incoherent ray batches we propose a novel implementation of ray streams which reduces the <b>bookkeeping</b> <b>cost</b> while strictly maintaining the preferred traversal order of individual rays. Both algorithms are designed around a fast traversal order look-up mechanism. We evaluate our work for primary visibility and diffuse GI and demonstrate significant performance gains over current state-of-the-art implementations...|$|R

40|$|We {{have argued}} that <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> system should be {{modified}} {{in accordance with the}} purpose for using them and the context. Because no <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> system that is relevant in every business or environment exists.

This mode of thought relates directly to proposition which develops to explain the theory of 'cost accounting change'. This paper examines the relationships among the purpose, reflexibility and contexts of <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> system. The analysis based on reflexibility theory and some previous studies for activity-based costing and contingency theory indicated that: 1) Actual reflexibility about existing <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> was associated with two contextual variables: product diversity and process complexity. 2) A reflexibility required mainly through the purpose for using <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> was associated with two contextual variables: competitive strategy and perceived environment uncertainty. Finally, we concluded that the relevance of <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> was lost and 'cost accounting change' became necessary when the level of actual reflexibility didn't fit that of required reflexibility...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Agricultural {{accounting}} is {{the most}} important information system in farms. The paper presents the degree of utilization of information derived from <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> in de-cision-making in farms. The study was conducted in 2011 through direct interviews with farmers in 475 individual farms located throughout the country. The results indicate that farmers making decisions with the use of information from the <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> most often do not use only one cost system. The most common is the full <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> (i. e. direct and indirect cost jointly), followed by <b>accounting</b> of direct <b>costs</b> and the <b>accounting</b> of variable and fixed costs.
