40|$|Five {{clinical}} isolates of Nocardia {{that showed}} ambiguous bases within the variable {{region of the}} 16 S rRNA gene sequence were evaluated {{for the presence of}} multiple copies of this gene. The type strains of three Nocardia species, Nocardia concava, Nocardia ignorata, and Nocardia yamanashiensis, which also showed ambiguous bases in the variable region, were also examined. Cloning experiments using an amplified region of the 16 S rRNA that contains the variable region showed that each isolate possessed 16 S rRNA genes with at least two different sequences. In addition, hybridization studies using a 16 S rRNA gene-specific probe and extracted genomic DNA of the patient isolates and of the type strain of N. ignorata showed that each isolate possessed at least three copies of the gene. These multiple <b>differing</b> <b>copies</b> of the 16 S rRNA gene and the results of DNA-DNA hybridization studies indicate problems of species definition and identification for such isolates.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Paediatric {{high grade}} glioma (pHGG) is a {{distinct}} biological entity to histologically similar tumours arising in older adults, and has <b>differing</b> <b>copy</b> number profiles and driver genetic alterations. As functionally important intragenic copy number aberrations (iCNA) and fusion genes begin to be identified in adult HGG, the same {{has not yet been}} done in the childhood setting. We applied an iCNA algorithm to our previously published dataset of DNA copy number profiling in pHGG with a view to identify novel intragenic breakpoints. RESULTS: We report a series of 288 iCNA events in pHGG, with the presence of intragenic breakpoints itself a negative prognostic factor. We identified an increased number of iCNA in older children compared to infants, and increased iCNA in H 3 F 3 A K 27 M mutant tumours compared to G 34 R/V and wild-type. We observed numerous gene disruptions by iCNA due to both deletions and amplifications, targeting known HGG-associated genes such as RB 1 and NF 1, putative tumour suppressors such as FAF 1 and KIDINS 220, and novel candidates such as PTPRE and KCND 2. We further identified two novel fusion genes in pHGG - CSGALNACT 2 :RET and the complex fusion DHX 57 :TMEM 178 :MAP 4 K 3. The latter was sequence-validated and appears to be an activating event in pHGG. CONCLUSIONS: These data expand upon our understanding of the genomic events driving these tumours and represent novel targets for therapeutic intervention in these poor prognosis cancers of childhood...|$|R

40|$|Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII) or Gordon Syndrome, {{is a rare}} {{familial}} {{monogenic disorder}} caused by mutations within the novel serine-threonine kinases WNK 1 and WNK 4. I describe here {{the development of a}} novel tetracycline-inducible transgenic mouse for PHAII in which the transgene carrying cDNA for a known disease causing mutation in WNK 4 (Wnk 4 Q 562 E) is regulated by the Tet-On system. The transgene contains a fluorescent marker a transactivator and a tetracycline response element, all in one plasmid, responsible for driving the expression of Wnk 4 Q 562 E cDNA in the presence of doxycycline. I show the steps taken {{in the creation of a}} transgenic PHAII animal model which resulted in six animal lines being produced with <b>differing</b> <b>copy</b> numbers of the transgene. The low, the middle and the highest transgene copy number animal lives, were chosen for further characterisation and then bred to homozygosity. All three chosen homozygous Wnk 4 Q 562 E transgenic animal lines overexpressed the mutant, Wnk 4 Q 562 E, mRNA transcript and exhibited the phenotypes of high blood pressure and hyperkalemia when dosed with doxycycline. Reversibility of the model and tight regulation of the transgene in these animal lines was demonstrated when doxycycline was removed, which resulted in a reduction in Wnk 4 Q 562 E mRNA levels and a return to normal blood pressure and normal plasma potassium levels. I also show by Western blotting microdissected segments of the nephron from doxycycline treated mice, that expression of NCC is increased as expected in the DCT. Increased NCC phosphorylation was also observed, suggesting increased transporter are responsible for the observed rise in blood pressure. FISH was used to visualise the presence of the Wnk 4 Q 562 E transgene construct within one of these animal lines; the transgene was located on chromosome 4.

40|$|Worldwide female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM) is acknowledged {{as a serious}} violation of human rights which needs to be actively combated. However, in Europe France {{has been the only}} state to have prosecuted cases of FGM: until 2007 37 cases were tried. As for the Netherlands, (assumingly) FGM is practised on a relatively small, but regular basis. Nevertheless, no cases have been prosecuted; moreover, there have few reports of (alleged) FGM to the Centre for Advising and Reporting on Child Abuse. For the past decade the Dutch Parliament has urged the Dutch government to develop a more robust policy towards FGM, including intervention by the criminal justice system. However, to date the Dutch government has opted for a policy focusing on prevention and medical/social assistance, including a preference for a (non-) statutory reporting code. Recommendations to introduce mandatory reporting, in order to enable the transfer of information needed to enable the criminal justice authorities to intervene, have been turned down. In doing so the Dutch government is neglecting the positive obligations embedded within the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), prescribing that states should offer adequate and effective protection against serious forms of ill-treatment (article 3 ECHR) and/or serious violations of physical integrity (article 8 ECHR), especially to vulnerable persons. Moreover, according to the ECtHR in cases of serious violations, intervention by the criminal justice system is indicated. Thus, retaining a policy which provides no guarantees for the transfer of information needed to provide for effective and adequate protection results in a potential violation of the ECHR by the Dutch government. There is an urgent need for a change of policy. Moreover, {{as a result of the}} consistent political pressure by Parliament, the Dutch government has taken a recent interest in the way in which the French handle FGM. However, as legal and cultural conditions <b>differ,</b> <b>copying</b> the French policy is not an option.
