Nine Japanese Nakajima Ki-49 (Helen) aircraft, escorted by up to twenty A6M Zero (Zeke) and Kawasaki Ki-61 (Tony) fighters bombed the beach area at 1630. There were three more air raids during the night, and 49 over the course of the month, but most were small.|$|E
5|$|Construction resumed in 1879 {{under the}} {{direction}} of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Lincoln Casey of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Casey redesigned the foundation, strengthening it so it could support a structure that ultimately weighed more than 40,000 tons. The first stone atop the unfinished stump was laid August 7, 1880 in a small ceremony attended by President Rutherford B. Hayes, Casey and a few others. The president placed a small coin on which he had scratched his initials and the date in the bed of wet cement at the 150-foot level before the first stone was laid on top of it. Casey found 92 memorial stones (presented stones) already inlaid <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> walls of the first phase of construction. Before construction continued he temporarily removed eight stones at the 150-foot level so that the walls at that level could be sloped outward, producing thinner second-phase walls. He inserted those stones and most of the remaining memorial stones stored in the lapidarium <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> walls during 1885–89. The bottom third of the monument is a slightly lighter shade {{than the rest of the}} construction because the marble was obtained from different quarries.|$|E

On October 18, the nearby Fort Chambly fell, and on October 30, an attempt at relief by Carleton was thwarted. When word of this {{made its way to}} St. Jean's defenders, combined with a new battery opening fire on the fort, the fort's defenders capitulated, surrendering on November 3.|$|E
5|$|At 10:29, Captain Aoki {{ordered the}} ship's {{magazines}} flooded. The forward magazines were promptly flooded, but the aft magazines were {{not due to}} valve damage, likely caused by the near miss aft. The ship's main water pump also {{appears to have been}} damaged, greatly hindering fire fighting efforts. On the upper hangar deck, at 10:32 damage control teams attempted to control the spreading fires by employing the one-shot CO2 fire-suppression system. Whether the system functioned or not is unclear, but the burning aviation fuel proved impossible to control, and serious fires began to advance deeper <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> of the ship. At 10:40, additional damage caused by the near-miss aft made itself known when the ship's rudder jammed 30 degrees to starboard during an evasive maneuver.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of recorded American history, the Harrisburg area was inhabited by several Algonquian tribes, including the Shawnee and Piankashaw, {{who lived in the}} dense inland forests. Prior to the arrival of European settlers, the Piankashaw tribe was driven out by the more aggressive Shawnee. European settlement in Illinois began with the French from 1690 and reached its peak about 1750, mainly along the Mississippi River. American settlers arrived in 1790. The French came as merchants and missionaries, with farming supplementing the need for trade. The result had benefited both the settlers and the Native Americans. The American migration, however, followed treaties which resulted in land being distributed through American Law, ignoring previous indigenous rights. Encroachment ensued and caused hard feelings between the Indians and the settlers who moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> and along migration routes. Many of the Indians allied themselves with the British to resist, though trade with the Americans was an important reason why the Native Americans remained largely peaceful.|$|E
5|$|Behind the incisors and canines, {{there were}} no {{additional}} teeth in the jaw. Where teeth would be located in therocephalians that do have teeth behind the canines, there is instead a large depression, or fossa, {{on the side of}} the maxilla, which is also bounded below by part of the lacrimal and possibly part of the jugal. This fossa is 48% the length of the jaw in the type specimen, and 38% in the second skull. In both skulls, this fossa is divided into two parts: a shallower ridge on top, and a larger and deeper depression on the bottom. A wide furrow beginning behind the canine contacts the bottom of the fossa and then passes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> of the mouth. The bottom portion of the fossa is strongly pitted and bears a small opening, or foramen, on both the front and back surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Chnodomar {{could not}} ignore Julian's {{fortification}} of Saverne, as it threatened his control of Alsace and blocked his main access route <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> of Gaul.

He also claimed to possess letters from Constantius granting the Alamanni the right to occupy those lands. Chnodomar had been surprised and dismayed by Julian's successful campaigns of 355-7. But he was encouraged by his own success against Barbatio and the intelligence brought to him by a deserter that Barbatio's withdrawal had left the Caesar with only 13,000 men. Having driven two Roman magistri from the field (Barbatio and before him, Magnentius' lieutenant, Decentius), Chnodomar had lost the barbarians' traditional fear of pitched battles with the Romans.|$|E

40|$|Circulations {{associated}} with the Indonesian Throughflow (IT), particularly concerning subsurface currents in the Pacific Ocean, are studied using three types of models: a linear, continuously stratified (LCS) model and a nonlinear, 41 2 -layer model (LOM), both confined to the Indo-Pacific basin; and a global, ocean general circulation model (COCO). Solutions are wind forced, and obtained with both open and closed Indonesian passages. Layers 1 – 4 of LOM correspond to near-surface, thermocline, subthermocline (thermostad), and upper-intermediate (AAIW) water, respectively, and analogous layers are defined for COCO. The three models share a common dynamics. When the Indonesian passages are abruptly opened, barotropic and baroclinic waves radiate <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>interiors</b> of both oceans. The steady-state, barotropic flow field from the difference (open – closed) solution is an anticlockwise circulation {{around the perimeter of}} the southern Indian Ocean, with its meridional branches confined to the western boundaries of both oceans. In contrast, steady-state, baroclinic flows extend <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>interiors</b> of both basins, a consequence of damping of baroclinic waves by diapycnal processes (internal diffusion, upwelling and subduction, and convective over-turning). Deep IT-associated currents are the subsurface parts of these baroclinic flows. I...|$|R

5|$|Due to a {{combination}} of political and strategic decisions, it was almost two years before the battalion went into combat again. In late 1944, in order to free up American troops for operations in the Philippines, Australian forces were directed to take over responsibility for operations around Aitape in New Guinea. The 6th Division returned to New Guinea in November 1944, with the final brigade arriving on 31 December 1944. Although basically cut off from resupply, there were around 35,000 Japanese troops in the area, holding the coast past Wewak and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior.</b> Supported by food supplies from native gardens in the Torricelli Mountains, the Japanese put up heavy resistance to the Australians' primary tactic of aggressive patrolling.|$|E
5|$|In late December 1944, the US 33rd Infantry Division's 136th Infantry Regiment {{was brought}} to Morotai from New Guinea to attack the Japanese 211th Infantry Regiment in {{the west of the}} island.

The 136th was supported by a battalion of the 130th Infantry Regiment advancing overland from the Doroeba Plain, artillery units stationed on islands off Morotai's coast and one hundred native porters. The 3rd Battalion of the 167th Infantry Regiment also participated in this operation and made a difficult march from Morotai's south coast <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> to prevent the Japanese from scattering into small groups in the island's mountains.|$|E
