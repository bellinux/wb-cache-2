5000|$|EU {{regulation}} 2560/2001 {{could make}} non-eurozone cash withdrawals within the European Economic Area cheaper for eurozone customers, because <b>euro</b> <b>cash</b> withdrawals are regulated. A Swedish law (SFS 2002:598) {{combined with the}} EU resolution {{does the same thing}} for Swedish cards if the transaction is in SEK or EUR. Generally, Eurozone banks charge a fixed fee for foreign cash withdrawals while domestic withdrawals are free of charge. Because of the EU regulation, this makes EEA withdrawals in euros free of charge. For example, let's say that a eurozone card is used for a withdrawal in the UK. With DCC there are two options: processing the transaction in pounds (good exchange rate but a fixed cash withdrawal fee) or processing the transaction in euros (bad exchange rate but no fixed cash withdrawal fee). For small amounts, the latter option may turn out cheaper.|$|E
