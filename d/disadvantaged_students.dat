40|$|Skripsie (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1994 The {{purpose of}} this study was to determine, by means of a review of the {{literature}} and an empirical investigation, the influence of certain variables on the academic achievement and the self-efficacy beliefs of <b>disadvantaged</b> gifted <b>students.</b> From the review of the literature it was concluded that self-efficacy beliefs influence academic achievement. Students with a high sense of self-efficacy for accomplishing a task participate more eagerly in a learning task, work harder, persist longer and achieve at a higher level than those who doubt their capabilities. Students with a high sense of self-efficacy are more self-regulated than those with a low sense of selfefficacy. It was concluded from the review of literature that <b>disadvantaged</b> gifted <b>students</b> perform lower than their potential due to various social and environmental factors. <b>Disadvantaged</b> gifted <b>students</b> are characterized by under-achievement, lack of general motivation to learn, parents with a low level of education, teachers who lack appreciation, poor socio-economic background, academic skills deficit, low selfesteem, rebellious attitude, lower expectations, and avoidance behaviours. <b>Disadvantaged</b> gifted <b>students</b> are very often not selected through the methods used for the identification of gifted students. This is because when those methods are used, the language, cultural and home background of the <b>disadvantaged</b> gifted <b>students</b> are not taken into consideration when results are interpreted. By means of an empirical investigation it could be concluded that there is a difference between <b>disadvantaged</b> gifted <b>students</b> and <b>disadvantaged</b> non-gifted <b>students</b> with relation to certain variables. The hypothesis that there is a relationship between certain variables and the academic achievement of <b>disadvantaged</b> gifted <b>students</b> and <b>disadvantaged</b> non-gifted <b>students</b> could be accepted.

5|$|Many {{commentators}} {{suggested that}} the 2012 rise in tuition fees in England would put poorer students off applying to university. However, the {{gap between rich and}} poor students has slightly narrowed (from 30.5% in 2010 to 29.8% in 2013) since the introduction of the higher fees. This may be because universities have used tuition fees to invest in bursaries and outreach schemes. In 2016, The Guardian noted that the number of <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>students</b> applying to university had increased by 72% from 2006 to 2015, a bigger rise than in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. It wrote that most of the gap between richer and poorer students tends to open up between Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 4 (i.e. at secondary school), rather than when applying for university, and so the money raised from tuition fees should be spent there instead.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 67 - 68) The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to investigate, compare and record the distinctions and differences between traditional student counseling and counseling of the economically <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>student</b> at a California community college. The hypothesis was that, traditionally and customarily, {{there have been some}} confusion and little distinction between the counseling process used for the traditional student and the counseling process used for the economically <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>student.</b> An investigation and literary research will demonstrate the obvious {{as well as some of}} the subtle differences between these two counseling processes. The premise was that a study of this kind would provide vital information and be very useful to the specialized counselor working with the non-traditional students who have unique counseling needs. The case histories were selected to illustrate the non-traditional methods necessary to counsel the economically <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>student</b> in panic or crisis counseling situations. In this thesis, ???crisis??? counseling means consistent, daily or weekly student support, encouragement, motivation, reinforcement, goal setting or whatever else the student needs in counseling for as long as the need exists. Some examples of the panic or crisis situations are suicide, anger, depression, withdrawal, aggression, low self-esteem due to the frustrations of trying to move into the mainstream of getting an education.

25|$|US News and World Report ranking In 2012, Wyalusing Area Junior Senior High School was {{recognized}} by US News and World Report as a Bronze level high school in a nationwide school ranking. The study was conducted by American Institutes for Research which examined how many students attained performance levels that exceed statistical expectations given the school's relative level of student poverty, as measured by state accountability test scores for all the school's students in the core subjects of reading and math. The study also examined the success rate for the school's least advantaged student groups (e.g., black, Hispanic, and economically <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>students)</b> that exceed state averages. The study included 752 high schools in Pennsylvania, including traditional public schools, public charter schools and public magnet schools. In Pennsylvania, 136 public high schools achieved a Bronze rating in 2012; 49 achieved a silver rating and 7 received a gold rating. The highest ranking went to Julia R.

25|$|The {{second issue}} that the Philippine {{educational}} system faces is the budget for education. Although it has been mandated by the Philippine Constitution {{for the government to}} allocate the highest proportion of its government to education, the Philippines remains to have one of the lowest budget allocations to education among ASEAN countries. The third prevalent issue the Philippine educational system continuously encounters is the affordability of education (or lack thereof). A big disparity in educational achievements is evident across various social groups. Socioeconomically <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>students</b> otherwise known as students who are members of high and low-income poverty-stricken families have immensely higher drop-out rates in the elementary level. Additionally, most freshmen students at the tertiary level come from relatively well-off families. Lastly, there is a large proportion of mismatch, wherein there exists a massive proportion of mismatch between training and actual jobs. This stands to be a major issue at the tertiary level and it is furthermore the cause of the continuation of a substantial amount of educated yet unemployed or underemployed people.|$|E

Drawing on personal memory, external data collection, and archival records this study is {{an examination of the}} author's experiences as a minority student in the k- 12 American school system and the implications of race and class on those educational experiences. Utilizing systematic self-observation, self-reflective data like interval and occurrence audio recording, and reflexive journaling, {{the second part of the}} study encompasses an examination of the challenges this minority educator experienced and witnessed his students experience while employed at a Hispanic Serving Institution in the Pacific Northwestern region of the U.

The study concludes with a theoretical and practical discussion of the findings and implications of the study for policy makers, educational leaders, and educators whose work impacts k- 12 and post-secondary institutions and minority student populations.
