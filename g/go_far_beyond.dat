In order to create an ideal montage for the greatest emotional impact on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room.

But as Eliza progresses through the district bee and prepares for the national bee, the troubled lives of her family come into sharp focus. Saul, who has tried to reach God, first through drugs and then through study, becomes convinced that Eliza's talent shows a propensity for mysticism greater than his, which has the potential to lead her to shefa, the influx of the Divine. He gradually introduces her to the writings of Abraham Abulafia, a Medieval kabbalist writer, and it becomes clear that his ambitions for her <b>go</b> <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> the winning of the spelling bee.|$|E

500|$|Multiple reviewers {{stressed}} the school's reliance on Neill as a charismatic figure, which begat doubts of the institution's general replicability. Sarah Crutis (The Times Literary Supplement) asked whether teachers {{would have the}} [...] "time, patience, and personality" [...] to use Neill's methods. [...] "Their extremes of endurance may sometimes sound masochistic", wrote D. W. Harding (New Statesman), and Richard E. Gross (The Social Studies) added that Neill's [...] "extremes ... <b>go</b> <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> good sense". Danica Deutsch (Journal of Individual Psychology) concluded that the school's lessons curbed the child's sense of social responsibility and other society-preserving functions. Jacob Hechler (Child Welfare) said that what Neill described as love—a combination of [...] "caring and noninterference"—was very hard to bring to bear. The New Yorker called Neill [...] "a fiery crusader" [...] with [...] "deep understanding of children", and Morris Fritz Mayer (Social Service Review) read Neill as having the [...] "wrath and eloquence of a biblical prophet" [...] with a belief in children and [...] "unyielding attack against pathological and phony values in education" [...] that [...] "one cannot help admiring". Willard W. Hartup (Contemporary Psychology) positioned Neill as closer to a psychotherapist than a teacher, especially as the philosophy undergirding Summerhill [...] "derives from Freud".

He wants to kill Bart and he makes no secret of it, save for lying to the parole board. Episodes since have made Bob far too wishy-washy. This was Bob in his prime—his vengeful, glorious, hilarious prime." [...] Canning also placed it at #1 {{on the list of}} the Top 10 Sideshow Bob episodes. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club noted that the episode [...] "turns {{limitations}} into strengths by spinning the need to fill out time into some of the series' sharpest, funniest and weirdest gags.

Sideshow Bob episodes consistently rank among the show's best and this represents the gold standard all subsequent Sideshow Bob episodes aspire to." [...] Empire called Bob's mishaps while strapped under the Simpsons' car the eighth-best film parody in the show, and called the rake scene [...] "the best bit of slapstick in Simpson history." [...] The parody of Cape Fear was named the 33rd greatest film reference {{in the history of the}} show by Total Films Nathan Ditum.

500|$|With the Khurramite threat over, the caliph began {{marshalling}} {{his forces}} for a reprisal campaign against Byzantium. A huge Arab army gathered at Tarsus; {{according to the}} most reliable account, that of Michael the Syrian, it numbered some 80,000 men with 30,000 servants and camp followers and 70,000 pack animals. Other writers give far larger numbers, ranging from 200,000 to 500,000 according to al-Mas'udi. Unlike earlier campaigns, which did not <b>go</b> <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> attacking the forts of the frontier zone, this expedition was intended to penetrate deep into Asia Minor and exact vengeance. The great city of Amorium in particular was the intended prize. The Arab chronicles record that Mu'tasim asked his advisors to name the [...] "most inaccessible and strongest" [...] Byzantine fortress, and they named Amorium, [...] "where no Muslim has gone since the appearance of Islam. It is the eye and foundation of Christendom; among the Byzantines, it is more famous than Constantinople". According to Byzantine sources, the caliph had the city's name written on the shields and banners of his soldiers. The capital of the powerful Anatolic Theme, the city was strategically located at {{the western edge of the}} Anatolian plateau and controlled the main southern route followed by the Arab invasions. At the time, Amorium was one of the largest cities in the Byzantine Empire, ranking in importance immediately after Constantinople. It was also the birthplace of Theophilos's father, Michael II the Amorian (r. 820–829), and perhaps of Theophilos himself. Due to its strategic importance, the city had been a frequent target of Arab attacks in the 7th and 8th centuries, and Mu'tasim's predecessor Ma'mun was said to be planning to attack the city when he died in 833.|$|E
