5|$|A {{neurovascular}} hypothesis <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> {{which states}} that poor functioning of the blood–brain barrier may be involved.|$|E
5|$|A novel solar CPV/CSP {{hybrid system}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed,</b> {{combining}} concentrator photovoltaics with the non-PV technology of concentrated solar power, or {{also known as}} concentrated solar thermal.|$|E

50|$|Antagonists of neurokinin-1 (NK1) {{receptor}}s (NK1 receptor antagonists), {{through which}} substance P acts, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> {{to belong to}} a new class of antidepressants, while NK2 antagonists <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> as anxiolytics and NK3 antagonists <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> as antipsychotics.|$|R
50|$|Mechanisms for SAE <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed.</b> Though microfilarial load is a {{major risk}} factor to post-Ivermectin SAE, three main {{hypotheses}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> for the mechanisms.|$|R
30|$|In the {{existing}} literature, several anomaly detection approaches for ITS <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed.</b> However, they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> mostly <b>proposed</b> for the vehicular networks, see e.g., [7 – 9].

5|$|As {{part of the}} Fjord City and {{redevelopment}} of Bjørvika, the Ekeberg Line <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> {{to follow}} a new line {{on the south side}} of Oslo Central Station to Jernbanetorget, with stops at Sørengautstikkeren and Bjørvika. As an alternative, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> that the tracks along Schweigaards gate be kept and that the trams along the Ekeberg Line alternate running via Bjørvika and Schweigaards gate.|$|E
5|$|As the Vanir {{are often}} {{considered}} fertility gods, the Æsir–Vanir War <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> {{as a reflection}} of the invasion of local fertility cults somewhere in regions inhabited by the Germanic peoples by a more aggressive, warlike cult. This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> as an analogy of the invasion of the Indo-Europeans. Georges Dumézil stated that the war need not necessarily be understood in terms of historicity more than any other myth however.|$|E
5|$|Installation of {{centralized}} {{traffic control}} is scheduled to take place as part of nationwide implementation of European Train Control System, {{which is scheduled to}} be completed within 2023. Capacity and efficiency on the line require more passing capacity, especially for longer freight trains. Thus the passing loop at Gudå Station <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> lengthened. To allow trains to run from the Meråker Line directly northward on the Nordland Line, a triangular line <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> at Hell Station. All regular freight trains on the line come from the north.|$|E
50|$|Two {{corridors}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> in the Second Master Plan by CMDA. These corridors <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> as {{a feeder}} service for Chennai MRTS, Chennai Metro, Chennai Suburban Railway and Metropolitan Transport Corporation.|$|R

5000|$|Raetian North Etruscan dedicatory votive objects <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{discovered}} featuring alu {{where the}} term means [...] "dedication".

5|$|A {{superphylum}} – TACK – <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> {{that includes}} the Thaumarchaeota, Aigarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, and Korarchaeota. This superphylum {{may be related to}} the origin of eukaryotes. More recently, the superphylum Asgard has been named and proposed to be more closely related to the original eukaryote and a sister group to TACK.|$|E

5|$|Another craft {{called the}} Venus Mobile Explorer <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> by the Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) {{to study the}} {{composition}} and isotopic measurements of the surface and the atmosphere, for about 90 days. A launch date {{has not yet been}} set.|$|E
5|$|Federation of Australia 1901 {{alternative}} date, 19 January - {{proposed as}} an alternative to traditional Australia Day because it is only one week earlier and can represent Federation 1901 with 19.01. Also 1 March <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> {{as an alternative}} for remembering Federation of Australia, 1 January 1901.|$|E
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> {{that a small}} amount, 40 to 270ppm, of {{vanadium}} in Wootz {{steel and}} Damascus steel significantly improved {{the strength of the}} product, though the source of the vanadium is unclear.|$|E

5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> {{to build}} a canal from Machar via Adar to the White Nile to {{increase}} the volume of water flowing to Northern Sudan and Egypt, which apparently could be done without major environmental impact, but political instability has prevented the project from starting.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{vanadium}} oxide <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> {{for use as}} a high energy density anode for lithium ion batteries, at 745Wh/L when paired with a lithium cobalt oxide cathode. Vanadium phosphates have been proposed as the cathode in the Lithium Vanadium Phosphate Battery, another type of lithium ion battery.|$|E
5|$|Middle Devonian basaltic {{volcanic}} {{rocks are}} found on western Hoy, on Deerness in eastern Mainland and on Shapinsay. Correlation between the Hoy volcanics {{and the other}} two exposures <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed,</b> but differences in chemistry means this remains uncertain.

5|$|Oxidative {{damage in}} DNA can cause cancer. Several {{antioxidant}} enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase etc. protect DNA from oxidative stress. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> that polymorphisms in these enzymes {{are associated with}} DNA damage and subsequently the individual's risk of cancer susceptibility.|$|E
