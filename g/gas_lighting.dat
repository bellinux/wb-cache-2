50|$|Technology was {{improving}} {{the lives of}} the residents. In 1898 <b>gas</b> <b>lights</b> were installed in East Haven. By 1903, four streets were <b>lighted</b> by <b>gas</b> <b>lights.</b> The town established its own telephone company in 1899 and had 75 customers before selling its holding to the local telephone company. Electric lights made their debut in 1918.|$|R
50|$|In 1801, Phillipe Lebon of Paris {{had also}} used <b>gas</b> <b>lights</b> to {{illuminate}} {{his house and}} gardens, and was considering how to light all of Paris. In 1820, Paris adopted <b>gas</b> street <b>lighting.</b>|$|R
5|$|Intrigued by {{the work}} of Frederick Winsor, who had been championing the {{introduction}} of <b>gas</b> <b>lighting</b> in London, Accum too, became fascinated by this innovation. At the request of the Gas Light and Coke Company, he carried out many experiments in this novel field of inquiry. After a time of close working association with this company, he became a member of its board of directors in 1812. The company was charged with founding the first gasworks in London to supply <b>gas</b> <b>lighting</b> to both private and public areas. Accum was instrumental in the conception and design of this extremely successful gasworks.|$|E
5|$|A Volunteer Fire Brigade {{was founded}} in 1844, {{comprising}} five men and a manual engine. The Provincial Gas Light and Coke Company began supplying <b>gas</b> <b>lighting</b> to the village in 1857, and in 1867 a railway station was built three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) west of the village, on the Lincoln-to-Grantham branch of the Great Northern Railway.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s the Uxbridge and District Electricity Supply Company had been {{established}} in Waterloo Road, {{and much of the}} town was connected by 1902, although some houses still had <b>gas</b> <b>lighting</b> in 1912. A water tower on Uxbridge Common was built in 1906, resembling a church tower, to improve the supply to the town.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>gas</b> <b>lights</b> that {{illuminated}} Paris {{at night}} during the Second Empire were often admired by foreign visitors and helped give the city its nickname Ville-Lumiére, the City of Light. [...] At {{the beginning of}} the Empire, there were 8000 <b>gas</b> <b>lights</b> in the city; by 1870, there were 56,573 used exclusively to light the city streets.|$|R
50|$|In 1892, two {{additional}} homes for Assistant Keepers were built. In 1902, a system was installed {{that caused the}} <b>gas</b> <b>light</b> to flash once every 30 seconds, instead of shining continually. In 1908, the <b>gas</b> <b>light</b> was replaced with one using incandescent vaporised paraffin. In 1953, a larger house was built for the Principal Keeper below the lighthouse.|$|R

5|$|The GWR began {{experimenting with}} the {{electric}} lighting in 1880, leading to Paddington being decorated with Christmas lights that year. Although {{the system was}} unreliable, it spurred the GWR on to a more ambitious lighting scheme in 1886, in which a 145V AC supply could light the terminus, office, goods yard and Royal Oak and Westbourne Park stations. It was praised for its scale and showing that electricity could compete with <b>gas</b> <b>lighting</b> on the same scale.|$|E
5|$|The Hyde Park Picture House, Hyde Park was {{originally}} built in 1908 as {{a hotel and}} in 1914 it was converted into a picture house. The cinema has <b>gas</b> <b>lighting,</b> the original organ and piano. It is a grade II listed building {{and one of the}} few surviving picture palaces in the UK. The picture house is regarded by many to be one of the finest examples of Edwardian architecture in Leeds.|$|E
5|$|The Sleaford Gas Light Company {{was formed}} in 1838 and the {{following}} year, <b>gas</b> <b>lighting</b> was provided and a gasworks was constructed on Eastgate. In 1866, the company was incorporated; in 1895–96, the works were rebuilt and lit the town until the company was nationalised in 1948. Gas ceased to be made here in the 1960s and the original buildings were retained although later extensions were demolished from 1966 to 1968.|$|E

In Cincinnati, Ohio, more than 1100 <b>gas</b> <b>lights</b> operate in areas that have been named historic districts. Gas lights also operate {{in parts of the}} famed French Quarter and outside historic homes throughout the city in New Orleans.|$|R
5|$|Chard {{claims to}} be the birthplace of powered flight, as it was here in 1848 that the Victorian {{aeronautical}} pioneer John Stringfellow first demonstrated that engine-powered flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. North Petherton was the first town in England (and one of the few ever) to be lit by acetylene <b>gas</b> <b>lighting,</b> supplied by the North Petherton Rosco Acetylene Company. Street lights were provided in 1906. Acetylene was replaced in 1931 by coal gas produced in Bridgwater, {{as well as by the}} provision of an electricity supply.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{is a very}} {{convenient}} way {{to transfer}} energy, {{and it has been}} adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of <b>gas</b> <b>lighting</b> greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Christian Accum or Frederick Accum (March 29, 1769 – June 28, 1838) was a German chemist, {{whose most}} {{important}} achievements included {{advances in the}} field of <b>gas</b> <b>lighting,</b> efforts to keep processed foods free from dangerous additives, and the promotion of interest in the science of chemistry to the general populace. From 1793 to 1821 Accum lived in London. Following an apprenticeship as an apothecary, he opened his own commercial laboratory enterprise. His business manufactured and sold a variety of chemicals and laboratory equipment. Accum, himself, gave fee-based public lectures in practical chemistry and collaborated with research efforts at numerous other institutes of science.|$|E

5|$|In {{his last}} years Evans {{compiled}} a list, since lost, {{of all his}} inventions—eighty in total, as alluded to {{in the title of}} his last publication to his lawyers. Some of his unfinished ideas that are known include a scheme for the <b>gas</b> <b>lighting</b> of cities in the United States, a means for raising sunken ships, a machine gun, a self-oiling shaft bearing, various types of gearshift for steam carriages, a dough-kneading machine and a perpetual baking oven. In one proposal in 1814, as the British Navy threatened Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812, Evans ventured to build a steam-powered frigate, but the scheme didn't get far.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} nineteenth century Tunbridge Wells {{experienced}} growth as a place for the well-to-do to visit and make their homes. It became a fashionable resort town again following visits by the Duchess of Kent, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and benefited from a new estate on Mount Pleasant and the building of the Trinity church in 1827, and improvements made to the town and the provision of facilities such as <b>gas</b> <b>lighting</b> and a police service meant that by 1837 the town population had swelled to 9,100. In 1842 an omnibus service was set up that ran from Tonbridge to Tunbridge Wells, enabling visitors to arrive from London within two hours, and in 1845 the town was linked to the railway network via a branch from South Eastern Railway's London-Hastings Hastings Line at Tonbridge. During this time Decimus Burton developed John Ward's Calverley Park estate.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{with the}} GCR on outer {{suburban}} services on the extension line saw {{the introduction of}} more comfortable Dreadnought Stock carriages from 1910. Ninety-two of these wooden compartment carriages were built, fitted with pressurised <b>gas</b> <b>lighting</b> and steam heating. Electric lighting had replaced the gas by 1917 and electric heaters were added in 1922 to provide warmth when hauled by an electric locomotive. Later formed into rakes of five, six or seven coaches, conductor rail pick-ups on the leading and trailing guard coaches were joined by a bus line and connected to the electric locomotive to help prevent gapping. Two rakes were formed with a Pullman coach that provided a buffet service for a supplementary fare. The Vintage Carriages Trust has three preserved Dreadnought carriages.|$|E

5|$|New {{environmental}} technologies in heating, lighting, ventilation and sanitation were also critical to creating taller buildings that were attractive to work in. Central heating {{could not be}} easily extended to serve larger buildings; in the 1850s, a system using low-pressure steam and steam-operated fans became adopted {{in the construction of}} the later skyscrapers. Many U.S. buildings were lit by gas, but this carried safety risks and was difficult to install in taller buildings. As an alternative, electric lights were installed from 1878 onwards, powered by basement generators. Ventilation was also a challenge, as smoke drifting into offices from the streets and the fumes from the <b>gas</b> <b>lighting</b> made air quality a major health issue. A steam-driven, forced-draft ventilation system was invented in 1860 and became widely used in taller buildings by the 1870s, overcoming much of the problem. Improvements in iron piping permitted running hot and cold water and sanitation facilities to be installed throughout taller buildings for the first time.|$|E
5|$|On 15 March 1870, Wagga Wagga was {{incorporated}} as a municipality and George Forsyth {{was chosen as}} the first Mayor of Wagga Wagga. <b>Gas</b> <b>lighting</b> was installed throughout the streets of Wagga Wagga in 1881, although once again North Wagga Wagga was neglected. By 1885, a town waterworks and reservoir was established although water quality remained a problem. Poor sanitation caused a horrific stench in the town and was blamed for a large increase in infectious diseases such as typhoid fever in the 1890s and early 1900s. In 1908 the Council approved a sewerage scheme and by 1914 most of the main streets were sewered. A free public library was opened in 1875 and the Council began to establish parklands such as Bolton Park and the Town Hall Gardens.|$|E
5|$|The present Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, {{designed}} by Benjamin Dean Wyatt {{on behalf of}} the committee led by Whitbread, opened on 10 October 1812 with a production of Hamlet featuring Robert Elliston in the title role. The new theatre made some concessions toward intimacy, seating 3,060 people, about 550 fewer than the earlier building (though this size is still considered an extremely large theatre). On 6 September 1817, <b>gas</b> <b>lighting</b> was extended from the audience area to the stage, making it the first British theatre to be gaslit throughout. In 1820 the portico that still stands at the theatre's front entrance on Catherine Street was added, and in 1822 the interior underwent a significant remodelling. The colonnade running down the Russell Street side of the building was added in 1831.|$|E
50|$|Gilfoot {{was built}} from 1936-39 and was pragmatically fitted out with {{electric}} street lighting. Initially, the street lights were {{not connected to}} an electricity supply, so <b>gas</b> <b>lights</b> were hung from lamp-posts until electrification could take place. The sight of this gave the area an eastern feel, leading local residents to refer to Gilfoot as Shanghai. Although the name is not in common use today, it persisted for many years after the <b>gas</b> <b>lights</b> were removed.|$|R
