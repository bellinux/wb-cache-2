Well-known catalysts of genetic instability include direct, inverted and tandem repeats, which are conspicuous in many commercially available cloning and <b>expression</b> <b>vectors.</b> Therefore, the reduction or complete elimination of extraneous noncoding backbone sequences would pointedly reduce the propensity for such events to take place and consequently the overall plasmid's recombinogenic potential.|$|E

SDS-PAGE was performed to determine the expression of PDT/GR-ΔLBD fusion protein,and it which was diluted into a final concentration of 0, 500 and 1000 nmol/L,labeled with fluorescein FITC and co-cultivated with TC- 1 cells for 2 hours,and the penetrativity was observed by fluorescence microscopy.

The purpose of a vector which transfers genetic information to another cell is typically to isolate, multiply, or express the insert in the target cell. All vectors may be used for cloning and are therefore cloning vectors, but there are also vectors designed specially for cloning, while others may be designed specifically for other purposes, such as transcription and protein <b>expression.</b> <b>Vectors</b> designed specifically for the expression of the transgene in the target cell are called <b>expression</b> <b>vectors,</b> and generally have a promoter sequence that drives expression of the transgene.

The other main characteristic is a T 7 promoter that allows for a high induction level upon addition of IPTG. The original pET 21 d <b>expression</b> <b>vector</b> was used in these experiments because it possesses these two intrinsic features.
