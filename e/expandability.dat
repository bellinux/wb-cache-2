40|$|Abstract [...] The {{southern}} San Joaquin Valley {{contains more}} than 7 km of sedimentary fili, largely Miocene and younger in age.

40|$|Abstract-The {{nature of}} interstratification n mixed-layer illite-montmorillonites ha been {{investigated}} by comparison of diffraction patterns of ethylene glycol and {{ethylene glycol monoethyl ether}} treated samples with calculated one-dimensional diffraction profiles. The calculated profiles {{take into account}} the effects of particle size distribution, chemical composition, and convolution factors as well as proportions of layers and interstratification type. On the basis of detailed matching of diffraction patterns of monomineralic illite-montmorillonites of known chemical composition it is concluded that there are three types of interstratification: (l) random, (2) allevardite-like ordering, and (3) super-lattice units consisting of three illite and one montmorillonite layers (IMII). By comparison ofsuites of calculated profiles with the diffraction patterns of many samples of illite-montmorillonites it i concluded that virtually all illite-montmorillonites with <b>expandabilities</b> from about 40 to 100 per cent are randomly interstratified (allevardite being exceptional); at < 40 per cent montmorillonite layers they almost always have ordered interstratification. Allevardite-like ordering predominates in illite-montmorillonites which have ordered interstratification, with the IMII superlattice varieties confined to samples with about 10 per cent montmorillonite layers...|$|R

500|$|Reception of the {{new design}} has been {{generally}} negative. The performance has been widely lauded, especially handling video tasks on the dual GPU units, with some reviewers noting the ability to apply dozens of filters to realtime 4K resolution video in Final Cut Pro X.

Technical reviewers praised the OpenCL API under which the machine's powerful twin GPUs and its multi-core CPU can {{be treated as a}} single pool of computing power. [...] However, in late 2013 through early 2014, some reviewers have noted the lack of internal <b>expandability,</b> second CPU, serviceability, and questioned the then-limited offerings via Thunderbolt 2 ports. By 2016, reviewers started to agree that the Mac Pro was lacking in functionality and power, and should be updated by Apple.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Clay mineral assemblages in both shales and {{sandstones}} of Miocene age {{have been}} studied in a well from the Ulleung Basin, a back-arc basin in the East Sea. Samples were examined from burial depths of ~ 800 to 3000 m. At the shallowest depths the shales contain assemblages dominated by R 0 mixed-layer illite-smectite (I-S) together with illite, kaolinite and minor chlorite. The sandstones also contain I-S, but are dominated by large amounts of authigenic kaolinite. In both shales and sandstones I-S becomes R 1 ordered at ~ 1000 m depth and at 2000 m depth, and deeper, I-S <b>expandabilities</b> are < 20 %. At ~ 2400 m depth, kaolinite in the sandstones is replaced by abundant Li-tosudite, indicating that clay mineral diagenesis has been affected by a hydrothermal episode. Furthermore, organic maturity data indicate {{that much of the}} succession has experienced considerably higher temperatures in the past. Vitrinite reflectance data are best modelled by a short lived (0. 1 - 0. 01 Ma) heating event in the Pliocene. This suggests that the shallow depths over which the smectite to illite reaction is completed and the extensive kaolinitization of the Miocene sandstones may also be related to the hydrotherrnal event.

In what follows, all spaces will be T 1 -spaces, and if {Gξ | ξ ∈ Ξ} {{is a family}} of subsets of a set X, we will assume that Gξ = Gη {{whenever}} ξ = η. Recall that a space X is called expandable (resp., discretely expandable) if for every locally finite (resp., discrete) family {Fξ | ξ ∈ Ξ} of subsets of X there exists a locally finite family {Gξ | ξ ∈ Ξ} of open subsets of X such that Fξ ⊆ Gξ for each ξ ∈ Ξ. The notions of σ-expandability and discrete σ-expandability were introduced by P. Y. Zhu [Sci. Math. Jpn. 65 (2007), no. 2, 173 – 178; MR 2299202 (2007 k: 54016) ], and the notions of (discrete) θ-expandability and (discrete) subexpandability by Y. Katuta [Fund.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{transformation}} of sodium and potassium smectite in omixed-layer clay was followed in hydrothermal kinetic experiments. Glasses of beidellite composition and the Wyoming bentonite {{were used as}} starting materials. Temperatures ranged between 260 and 490 ~ at 2 kbar pressure, and run times ranged between 6 hr and 266 days. The course of the reactions {{was found to be}} strongly affected by interlayer chemistry. When potassium was the interlayer cation, increasing reaction produced the series: randomly interstratified illite/smectite-ordered interstratified illite/smectite-illite. This sequence is equivalent to that formedin shales during burial diagenesis. With interlayer sodium an te peratures above 300 ~ an aluminous beidellite (Black Jack analog) -rectorite-paragonite series was realized. The difference between these two diagenetic fami-lies is discussed. Below 300 ~ sodium beidellite formed randomly interstratified mixed-layer clay much hke potassium beidellite, except that a higher layer charge was equi ed to produce sodium mica-like layers. The higher charge resulted fromsodium's higher hydration energy. The difference in hydration energy between potassium and sodium may account for the fixation of potassium rather than sodium in illite during burial diagenesis. The appearance of ordered interlayering in mixed-layer phases i also related to interlayer chemistry. Ordering formed in sodium clays at high <b>expandabilities,</b> whereas it never appeared in the potassium clays above approximately 35 % expandable. The appearance of ordering may be partly related to the polarizing power of the m~ca-like layers. Phase diagrams, constructed from the kinetic experiments and f o the composition and occurrence of natural clays, are presented for the systems paragonite and muscovite- 2 quartz-kaolinite-excess water.
