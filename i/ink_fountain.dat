50|$|The <b>ink</b> <b>fountain</b> stores a {{quantity}} of ink in a reservoir and feeds small quantities of ink to the distribution rollers from the <b>ink</b> <b>fountain</b> roller and the ink ductor roller. The ink ductor roller is a movable roller that moves {{back and forth between}} the <b>ink</b> <b>fountain</b> roller and an ink distribution roller. As the ductor contacts the <b>ink</b> <b>fountain</b> roller, both turn and the ductor is inked. The ductor then swings forward to contact an ink distribution roller and transfers ink to it. There are generally two types of ink distribution rollers: the ink rotating rollers (or ink transfer rollers), which rotate in one direction, and the ink oscillating rollers (or ink vibrating rollers), which rotate and move from side to side. The ink distribution rollers receive ink and work it into a semiliquid state that is uniformly delivered to the ink form rollers. A thin layer of ink is then transferred to the image portions of the lithographic plate by the ink form rollers.|$|E

The {{most common type of}} fountain consists of a metal blade that is held in place near the fountain roller. The gap between the blade and the <b>ink</b> <b>fountain</b> roller can be controlled by adjusting screw keys to vary the amount of ink on the fountain roller. The printer adjusts the keys in or out as the <b>ink</b> <b>fountain</b> roller turns to obtain the desired quantity of ink. In simple presses, the printer must turn these screws by hand. In modern presses, the adjusting screws are moved by servomotors which are controlled by the printer at a press console. Thus the printer can make ink adjustments electronically. If the printer needs to increase or decrease ink in an area of the plate (print), he need only adjust the needed keys to allow more or less ink flow through the blade. The ink flow can also be controlled by the rotation velocity of the <b>ink</b> <b>fountain</b> roller.|$|E

50|$|In printing, anilox is {{a method}} used to provide a {{measured}} amount of ink to a flexo printing plate An anilox roll is a hard cylinder, usually constructed of a steel or aluminum core which is coated by an industrial ceramic whose surface contains millions of very fine dimples, known as cells. ==Usage== Depending on the detail of the images to be printed, the press operator will select an anilox roll with a higher or lower line screen. Low line screen rolls are used where a heavy layer of ink is desired, such as in heavy block lettering. Higher line screens produce finer details and are used in four-color process work such as reproducing photographs. Often a job will require a different line screen for each color to be printed. Experienced press operators are skilled at determining the appropriate rolls for a given print job.Depending {{on the design of}} the printing press, the anilox roll is either semi-submerged in the <b>ink</b> <b>fountain,</b> or comes into contact with a so-called metering roller, which is semi-submerged in the <b>ink</b> <b>fountain.</b> In either instance, a thick layer of typically viscous ink is deposited on the roll. A doctor blade is used to scrape excess ink from the surface leaving just the measured amount of ink in the cells.

Pressroom practices have evolved more out of experience than on the basis of any theory. The objective of this paper is to develop a mathematical model for the non-image area of the offset lithographic plate. A model of this kind would provide a rationalization for the observed behavior in lithographic process. The study concentrates on the various materials and the phenomena involved. Properties of aluminum oxide surface and gum arabic that make them suitable for the process have been presented. Rheological properties of ink have been discussed to show their effect on the print quality. Most importantly the subject of surface energetics has been used to explain the interfacial behavior of the three phases involved - <b>ink,</b> <b>fountain</b> solution and plate surface. The study of the interfacial behavior helps in arriving at the final model. There are several phenomena taking place in making lithography work. Adsorption of gum arabic, wetting of the plate by fountain solution and film splitting at the nip exit are explained and the interrelationship between them derived. Surface energetic equations and Griffith 2 Ì† 7 s free energy for fracture have been used to present the final model for the system.

40|$|This thesis {{claims a}} {{relationship}} between the film splitting sound emission from the printing press nip and the dynamic interaction occurring there between <b>ink,</b> <b>fountain</b> solution and substrate in offset lithography. The film splitting sound derives from the cavitation formed by the pressure drop {{in the second half of}} the print nip flow passage. As the ink film is strained, the cavities expand and eventually implode into breaking filaments at the nip exit, while emitting a partly audible, broadband, high frequency, noisy sound. A free-field microphone, A/D-converter and laptop computer were used to record pressure signals in the frequency range of 10 Hz to 50 kHz emitted by a variety of printing instruments and presses for a range of offset ink and paper types. After signal acquisition and filtering two signal averages of power and frequency were estimated. This average power increased with increasing loads of sheet-fed offset ink on an ink distributor, in accordance with a mass-conservation model developed. The behaviour of average frequency and power over different ink load ranges indicated transitions between different flow regimes. A glossy fine-coated paper gave higher average power than a corresponding matte paper during printing with such inks on a laboratory device, possibly due to an air sealing effect. The sound from tack measurements with the Deltack instrument during setting of heat-set offset inks printed on MWC papers showed a relation between the measured tack rise and average power, reflecting changes in splitting mechanism during the course of setting. With the Hydroscope instrument the interaction between these heat-set inks and fountain solution was studied, with the measured tack and sound emission displaying a clear, but non-linear, correlation. A heat-set offset pilot trial showed that the acoustic response from the printing nip sensitively and systematically detected changes in (LWC) paper type, optical density, ink-fount balance, and press stability. Pilot trials of cold-set offset inks on newsprint by sheet-fed presses indicated a strong correlation between evolution in average power, optical density and fountain solution consumption during the first thousand sheets normally needed for stabilisation. Acoustic measurements of ink film splitting have, aside from the laboratory studies performed by one Japanese group, previously received little attention, with the current study showing that a great deal of information useful to the printer can be accessed from this sound emission. Although the detailed mechanisms for ink film splitting have to be further studied and supported by mathematical simulation, the sensitivity of the acoustic method recommends its implementation for monitoring and control of offset printing.

An emulsification curve can {{shed some light on}} how ink might perform on a press but this alone is not enough. The objective of this thesis research was to study the interaction of <b>fountain</b> solution and <b>ink</b> as used in the printing of newspapers, in terms of ink water pick-up rates and capacity. Further, this is a study of the effect of the <b>fountain</b> solution and <b>ink</b> interaction on ink transfer, drying, rub resistance, set-off and strength. In this study, three different black news inks and three different fountain solutions have been used to make a total of nine different <b>ink</b> and <b>fountain</b> solution combinations. One set was a specific black news <b>ink</b> and <b>fountain</b> solution combination, Flint Low Rub Black and Anchor Neutral Fountain Solution, used in the printing of USA Today at Boston Offset in Norwood, MA. The paper, a 30 # newsprint, was the only newsprint used throughout the testing. Water pick up rates have been determined and emulsification curves have been developed {{with the use of a}} Duke Tester for all nine <b>ink</b> and <b>fountain</b> solution combinations. The effect of these water pick-up rates on the rheological characteristics has been studied with the use of a Brookfield Rotational Viscometer. With the use of a motorized Little Joe printability tester, ink was laid down on the newsprint at a constant volume and any changes in ink strength were measured with a densitometer. Rub resistance was examined with a Rub Tester and a densitometer. The experimental data from this study show a direct correlation between the water pick-up capacity of an ink and the affect this has on the ink rheology and ink performance. The tests and data revealed that each ink had a tendency to pick-up more of the alkaline fountain solution than the neutral solution. The least was picked up with the acid fountain solution. The more <b>fountain</b> solution the <b>inks</b> picked up, the greater the changes in viscosity, strength, dryback and rub-off. With the low-rub premium and the dense black, the viscosity rose higher as the <b>ink</b> picked-up more <b>fountain</b> solution. The soy low-rub ink reacted differently. The soy ink had an initial drop in viscosity then, as the ink began to pick up more fountain solution, the viscosity seemed to stabilize.

40|$|In offset lithography, ink {{has been}} shown to pickup {{significant}} quantities of fountain solution as emulsified droplets. Good printability of lithographic inks is dependent on the balance between the flow of <b>ink</b> and water (<b>fountain</b> solution). Water pickup of ink is directly related to emulsification capacity. Emulsification must be controlled by using the correct fountain solution and proper surface tension value of <b>fountain</b> solution.

40|$|The {{permanence}} of printed documents and books {{appears to be}} primarily dependent on paper stability. Other researchers implicate pH as {{a major factor in}} the deterioration rate of paper and acidity as major the cause of this deterioration. During the lithographic printing process, ink is in direct contact with fountain solution, which can be acidic or alkaline. Fountain solution is a mixture of water and chemicals used to keep the non-image areas of a lithographic plate moist. On press the intimate contact of <b>ink</b> with <b>fountain</b> solution creates a fountain solution-in-ink emulsion. The emulsion used here is a stable suspension of fountain solution droplets within the ink. The objective of this study was to determine if ink/fountain solution emulsion, which is printed on paper during lithographic printing, affects the rate of deterioration of paper. The stability of four commonly available papers was observed. These paper types were groundwood, publication grade, coated book, and uncoated book. Samples of the four paper groups were printed with four different ink formulations. The ink formulations were ink, ink and distilled water, <b>ink</b> and acidic <b>fountain</b> solution, and <b>ink</b> and alkaline <b>fountain</b> solution. Samples of the unprinted and printed paper were subjected to an accelerated - aging process by heating the samples for 72 hours at 100 C. The properties of unaged and aged papers were evaluated by pH determination, folding endurance, and tearing resistance. On the basis of statistical analysis of the data, inferences were made about the effect of the ink formulations on the paper properties. This experiment indicates that ink/fountain solution emulsion did affect the paper pH, but this effect is due to the ink with little change in pH due to the addition of acidic or alkaline fountain solution to the ink. The results of folding endurance and tearing resistance tests after accelerated aging established no clear pattern of variance that would indicate the differences observed in these properties were due to the pH change associated with the ink/fountain solution emulsions. Several unexpected occurrences were exhibited by this experiment. These include: groundwood was the paper least affected by the aging process; the pH of coated paper increased with the application of ink/fountain solution emulsion; a decrease in tearing resistance was associated with alkaline fountain solution...|$|R
