5|$|Redback {{antivenom}} {{was developed}} by Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, then a government body involved with discovering antivenoms for many venomous Australian creatures. Production involves the milking of venom from redbacks and repeatedly inoculating horses with non-lethal doses. The horse immune systems makes polyclonal antibodies. Blood plasma, containing the antibodies, is extracted by plasmapheresis. The plasma is treated with pepsin, and the active F(ab')2 fragments are separated and purified. Each vial contains 500 units of redback antivenom in approximately 1.5 ml, which is enough to inactivate 5mg of redback spider venom in a test tube. The antivenom has been safely administered to women {{in various stages of}} pregnancy. Redback antivenom has been widely used in Australia since 1956, although evidence from controlled studies for <b>its</b> <b>effectiveness</b> has been lacking. Recent trials show antivenom has a low response rate little better than placebo, and any effect is less than might be achieved with optimal use of standard analgesics. Further studies are needed to confirm or refute <b>its</b> <b>effectiveness.</b> It appears clinically active against arachnidism caused by Steatoda spiders; however, as these cases are often mild and the evidence of <b>its</b> <b>effectiveness</b> is limited, this treatment is not recommended. Similarly, the antivenom has been reported as effective with bites of L. katipo, and L. tredecimguttatus. Animal studies also support its use against envenomation from other widow spiders, having successfully been tested against venom from L. mactans, L. hesperus, and L. tredecimguttatus (synonym L.lugubris).|$|E

5|$|Benzoyl {{peroxide}} (BPO) is a first-line {{treatment for}} mild and moderate acne due to <b>its</b> <b>effectiveness</b> and mild side-effects (mainly skin irritation).

Additionally, benzoyl peroxide is mildly effective at breaking down comedones and inhibiting inflammation. Benzoyl peroxide may be paired with a topical antibiotic or retinoid such as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Captain Louis Mountbatten's 5th Flotilla of K class destroyers {{were painted}} Mountbatten pink in 1940. Mountbatten {{observed}} a Union-Castle Liner disappear from convoy during an autumn sunset {{because of the}} company's unusual lavender-mauve-gray hull color. Mountbatten reasoned the color would be effective camouflage during dawn and dusk periods, and devised a similar shade by mixing medium gray {{with a small amount}} of venetian red. <b>Its</b> <b>effectiveness</b> was much disputed; but it was applied to other destroyers, a few cruisers, and numerous small warships which maintained the scheme through 1944 for use in coastal waters.|$|E
5|$|Countershading is {{less often}} used for {{military}} camouflage, despite Second World War experiments that showed <b>its</b> <b>effectiveness.</b> English zoologist Hugh Cott encouraged the use of techniques including countershading, but despite his authority on the subject, failed to persuade the British authorities. Soldiers often wrongly viewed camouflage netting {{as a kind of}} invisibility cloak, and they had to be taught to look at camouflage practically, from the enemy observer's point of view. At the same time in Australia, zoologist William John Dakin advised soldiers to copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.|$|E

Despite <b>its</b> clear pharmacologic <b>effectiveness,</b> <b>its</b> clinical <b>effectiveness</b> in treating opioid dependence has been disappointing, {{primarily due to}} non-compliance with taking the medication.
