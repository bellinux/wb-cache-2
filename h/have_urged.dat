5|$|India's {{labour force}} is growing by 2.5% every year, but {{employment}} is growing only at 2.3% a year. Official unemployment exceeds 9%. Regulation and other obstacles have discouraged {{the emergence of}} formal businesses and jobs. Almost 30% of workers are casual workers who work only when {{they are able to}} get jobs and remain unpaid {{for the rest of the}} time. Only 10% of the workforce is in regular employment. India's labour regulations are heavy even by developing country standards and analysts <b>have</b> <b>urged</b> the government to abolish them.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} project became controversial as environmental protection non-governmental organizations (NGOs) drew public {{attention to a}} possible threat that may arise to seven species of bats. Subsequently, the NGOs alleged that the project is illegal, environmentally unsafe, financially not feasible, and technically questionable. Project legality was disputed because {{it is based on}} a 1999 environmental impact assessment (EIA), while Croatian legislation requires that EIAs must not be more than two years old. Flooding of Vilina Cave is cited as an environmental concern, while the financial issues are based on previous cost overruns by Hrvatska elektroprivreda—the state-owned company planning the development—in other projects. One objection to the technical aspects of the project is the possibility that the groundwater may trigger earthquakes. Opponents of the project <b>have</b> <b>urged</b> the Prime Minister of Croatia to cancel development of the plant.|$|E

Concerns were also expressed for Pulau Merambong near the western boundary of Malaysia and Singapore. The Menteri Besar of Johor, Abdul Ghani Othman, assured the public that Pulau Pisang belongs to Johor under a 1900 agreement between Sultan Ibrahim of Johor and British administrators in colonial Singapore. Nonetheless, Malaysian agencies have taken up efforts to stake claims over a hundred islands, reefs, rocks and other features in the South China Sea, Malacca Straits, and off Sabahan waters that Malaysia could lose to China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Two of these islands are Pulau Unarang off eastern Sabah near the Indonesian border, and Pulau Perak {{to the west of}} Penang.|$|E

25|$|Like most Daylamites at the time, the Buyids were Shia {{and have}} been called Twelvers. However, {{it is more likely}} that they began as Zaydis. As the reason of this turning from Zaydism to Twelverism, Moojen Momen {{suggests}} that since the Buyids were not descendants of Ali, the first Shi'i Imam, Zaydism would <b>have</b> <b>urged</b> them to install an Imam from Ali's family. For that reason Buyids tended toward Twelverism, which has an occulted Imam, which was more politically attractive to them.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} year, Titus Lartius Flavus was appointed the first dictator, {{and as his}} magister equitum he nominated Cassius. The reason for the institution of these offices was the fear of impending war with both the Sabines and the Latins. After a failed round of negotiations, war was declared against the Sabines, but as both sides were reluctant to come to blows, no hostilities ensued. War with the Latins came in 498 BC, with the Battle of Lake Regillus. Following the Roman victory, Cassius is said to <b>have</b> <b>urged</b> the senate to destroy the Latin towns.|$|E

25|$|At the 2010 {{meeting of}} the International Whaling Commission in Morocco, representatives of the 88 member nations {{discussed}} {{whether or not to}} lift the 24-year ban on commercial whaling. Japan, Norway and Iceland <b>have</b> <b>urged</b> the organization to lift the ban. A coalition of anti-whaling nations has offered a compromise plan that would allow these countries to continue whaling, but with smaller catches and under close supervision. Their plan would also completely ban whaling in the Southern Ocean. More than 200 scientists and experts have opposed the compromise proposal for lifting the ban, and have also opposed allowing whaling in the Southern Ocean, which was declared a whale sanctuary in 1994 (Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary).|$|E
25|$|Liberal Muslims <b>have</b> <b>urged</b> that ijtihad, {{a form of}} {{critical}} thinking, be used to develop a more progressive form of Islam {{with respect to the}} status of women. In addition, Islamic feminists have advocated for women's rights, gender equality, and social justice grounded in an Islamic framework. Although rooted in Islam, pioneers of Islamic feminism have also used secular and western feminist discourses and have sought to include Islamic feminism in the larger global feminist movement. Islamic feminists seek to highlight the teachings of equality in Islam to question patriarchal interpretations of Islamic teachings. Others point out the incredible amount of flexibility of shariah law, which can offer greater protections for women if the political will to do so is present.|$|E

25|$|Unemployment in India is characterised by chronic (disguised) unemployment. Government {{schemes that}} target {{eradication}} of both poverty and unemployment – which {{in recent decades}} has sent millions of poor and unskilled people into urban areas in search of livelihoods – attempt {{to solve the problem}} by providing financial assistance for starting businesses, honing skills, setting up public sector enterprises, reservations in governments, etc. The decline in organised employment, due to the decreased role of the public sector after liberalisation, has further underlined the need for focusing on better education and created political pressure for further reforms. India's labour regulations are heavy, even by developing country standards, and analysts <b>have</b> <b>urged</b> the government to abolish or modify them {{in order to make the}} environment more conducive for employment generation. The 11th five-year plan has also identified the need for a congenial environment to be created for employment generation, by reducing the number of permissions and other bureaucratic clearances required. Inequalities and inadequacies in the education system have been identified as an obstacle, which prevents the benefits of increased employment opportunities from reaching all sectors of society.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the later}} part of American history, and into modern times, the {{relationship}} between American and European music has been a discussed topic among scholars of American music. Some <b>have</b> <b>urged</b> for the adoption of more purely European techniques and styles, which are sometimes perceived as more refined or elegant, while others have pushed {{for a sense of}} musical nationalism that celebrates distinctively American styles. Modern classical music scholar John Warthen Struble has contrasted American and European, concluding that the music of the United States is inherently distinct because the United States has not had centuries of musical evolution as a nation. Instead, the music of the United States is that of dozens or hundreds of indigenous and immigrant groups, all of which developed largely in regional isolation until the American Civil War, when people from across the country were brought together in army units, trading musical styles and practices. Struble deemed the ballads of the Civil War [...] "the first American folk music with discernible features that can be considered unique to America: the first 'American' sounding music, as distinct from any regional style derived from another country." ...|$|E
