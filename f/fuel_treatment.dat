40|$|After nearly 100 {{years of}} fire exclusion, {{introduced}} pests, and selective harvesting, {{a change in}} forest composition has occurred in many Inland West forests of North America. This change in forest structure has frequently been accompanied by increases in root diseases and/or an unprecedented buildup of fuels. Consequently, many forest managers are implementing plans for <b>fuels</b> <b>treatments</b> to {{lower the risk of}} severe wildfires. Impacts on root disease should be considered before selecting appropriate <b>fuels</b> <b>treatments.</b> Complex interactions exist among conifer root diseases, <b>fuels</b> <b>treatments,</b> forest structure, species composition, stand history, and other environmental factors. As forest managers prescribe <b>fuels</b> <b>treatments,</b> their success in lowering the risk of severe wildfire will depend in part on the impacts of these treatments on root disease.

Objective: Assess whether <b>fuel</b> <b>treatments</b> reduce fire intensity and spread and increase carbon storage under climate change. Methods: We used a simulation modeling approach that couples a landscape model of forest disturbance and succession with an ecosystem model of carbon dynamics (Century), to quantify the interacting effects of climate change, <b>fuel</b> <b>treatments</b> and wildfire for carbon storage potential in a mixed-conifer forest in the western USA. Results: Our results suggest that <b>fuel</b> <b>treatments</b> have the potential to ‘bend the C curve’, maintaining carbon resilience despite climate change and climate-related changes to the fire regime.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Fuel</b> <b>treatments</b> {{have been}} widely used as a tool to reduce catastrophic {{wildland}} fire risks in many forests around the world. However, it is a challenging task for forest managers to prioritise where, when and how to implement <b>fuel</b> <b>treatments</b> across a large forest landscape. In this study, an optimisation model was developed for long-term fuel management decisions at a landscape scale. Using a simulated annealing algorithm, the model optimises locations and timing of <b>fuel</b> <b>treatments,</b> while considering changes in forest dynamics over time, fire behaviour and spread, values at risk, and operational feasibility. The model employs the Minimum Travel Time algorithm in FlamMap and the Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator to assess spatial and temporal effects with and without <b>fuel</b> <b>treatments.</b> The objective function is set tominimise total expected loss from a landscape due towildfires throughout the planning horizon. The model was applied to a 14 000 -ha study landscape located {{on the west side of}} the Bitterroot Valley in Montana.

Objectives: To contrast {{the relative importance of}} <b>fuel</b> <b>treatment</b> effort, ignition management effort and weather for simulated total area burned and area burned by moderate-to-high intensity fire, and to determine the level of consensus among independent models. Methods: Published and previously unreported data from simulation experiments using three landscape fire models, two incorporating weather from south-eastern Australia and one with weather from a Mediterranean location, were compared. The comparison explored variation in <b>fuel</b> <b>treatment</b> and ignition management effort across ten separate years of daily weather. Importance of these variables was measured by the Relative Sum of Squares in a Generalised Linear Model analysis of total pixels burned and pixels burned with moderate-to-high intensity fire. Results: Variation in <b>fuel</b> <b>treatment</b> effort, from 0 to 30 % of landscape treated, explained less than 7 % of variation in both total area burned and area burned by moderate-to-high intensity fire.

Fuel treatments aimed directly at patch management could effec-tively lower the risk of future fires that may spread along various directions and with different spread speeds and durations.
