5|$|Utilitarianism {{is a type}} of consequentialist ethical theory. According to such theories, {{only the}} outcome of an action is morally {{relevant}} (this contrasts with deontology, according to which moral actions flow from duties or motives). Utilitarianism is a combination of consequentialism and the philosophical position hedonism, which states that pleasure, or <b>happiness,</b> <b>is</b> the only good worth pursuing. Therefore, since only the consequences of an action matter, and only happiness matters, only happiness that is the consequence of an action is morally relevant. There are similarities with preference utilitarianism, where utility is defined as individual preference rather than pleasure.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1844, Thayer left the {{lithography}} business {{and was replaced by}} John Bufford, a lithographer who worked for Thayer in Boston from 1939 through 1844. Previously, from 1835 through 1839, Bufford owned his own firm in New York under the title Bufford Lithographer. By the end of 1844 through 1851, the Boston company name was changed to J. H. Bufford & Co. The next, third edition, listed Bufford Lithographer so the third edition must have been printed after the beginning of {{the fall of}} 1844 but before the end of 1844. J. H. Bufford & Co. printed other Ives' games but this third edition of Ives' The Mansion Of <b>Happiness</b> <b>is</b> the only Ives' game to list Bufford Lithographer. Green was again used on one of the litho stones but the end space was a green circle. The other litho stone printed black.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between health and <b>happiness</b> <b>was</b> explored using a cross-sectional survey of 383 community-dwelling older adults. As {{a function of}} self-reported health, median <b>happiness</b> <b>was</b> increasing at a decreasing rate; <b>happiness</b> variability <b>was</b> decreasing at a decreasing rate. In multivariable logistic regression, lowest-quartile <b>happiness</b> <b>was</b> associated with poverty, unfavorable subjective health, debilitating pain and urinary incontinence, {{but not with the}} comorbidity count or other comorbidities. The results, robust to common method bias, suggest that subjective health measures are better predictors of happiness than objective measures are, except for conditions that disrupt daily functioning or are associated with social stigma...|$|R

5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing <b>happiness</b> <b>is</b> lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} written and {{recorded}} {{in two months}} while the band was still on tour in support of their previous record, <b>Happiness...</b> <b>Is</b> Not a Fish That You Can Catch, which had only been released 14 months prior. A combination of lead singer-songwriter Raine Maida's prolific songwriting {{at the time and}} lead-guitarist Mike Turner's discovery of The Age of Spiritual Machines in a bookstore hurried the completion of the album. The band only took a break from recording to organize and perform at Summersault in 2000. Unlike their previous releases, this one features a more organic, acoustic sound, and less obvious layering and electronic texturing.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Mavis starts dating {{the equally}} shy Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield), {{but it remains}} platonic. Jerry dies {{of a heart attack}} in 1975 before being able to express his romantic intentions. She meets {{salesman}} Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin) the following year. They date, but the relationship is strained by Derek's interfering mother, who believes that Mavis is not good enough for her son. The relationship remains non-committal until 1983, when another man competes for Mavis's hand, the artistic Victor Pendlebury (Christopher Coll). Mavis is torn as she likes both but chooses Derek in the end. On their wedding day in 1984 Mavis has second thoughts about marrying Derek and jilts him at the altar. Her guilt turns to indignation when she learns that Derek– feeling the same way she does– did not attend the ceremony either. Derek goes on to an unhappy marriage with Angela Hawthorne (Diane Fletcher), but in 1986 he begins wooing Mavis again, realizing he made a mistake when he let her go. Mavis eventually decides Derek is the man for her and the couple marry in September 1988. The other residents of Coronation Street consider Mavis and Derek something of a joke, but neither care as they are genuinely in love. They spend evenings reading aloud to each other and discussing the events of the day. They remain happy despite the occasional problem, but their <b>happiness</b> <b>is</b> cut short in 1997 when Derek dies suddenly of a heart attack after a road rage incident. Devastated, at his funeral Mavis chastises those who mocked her marriage over the years.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to identify factors associated with happiness in the elderly. A cross-sectional, population-based {{study was conducted in}} 1, 431 elderly under the ISA-Camp 2008 project. The survey used a two-stage probabilistic cluster sample. Prevalence of <b>happiness</b> <b>was</b> measured over time according to socio-demographics variables, health behaviors, and health conditions. High prevalence of <b>happiness</b> <b>was</b> associated with: marital status (married), active working, activity and insufficient leisure-time activity, occasional consumption of alcoholic beverages, daily consumption of fruit, vegetables, and leafy vegetables, normal body mass index, and sleeping less than 10 hours/night and sleeping well. The highest prevalence of long-term <b>happiness</b> <b>was</b> observed among elderly with no reported illness, with better self-rated health, and with less disability. <b>Happiness</b> <b>was</b> strongly related to health indicators, suggesting the adequacy of complementary use of this indicator for evaluating health promotion programs in the elderly...|$|R

40|$|Hokkaido – a {{northern}} island of Japan that was settled by ethnic Japanese {{during the late}} 19 th century and the early 20 th century – may remain to be a hybrid of interdependent culture of the mainland Japan and independent culture associated with frontier settlement. We thus anticipated that contemporary Hokkaido residents would exhibit either independent or interdependent psychological profiles depending on the types of behaviors that were required in a given situation. As expected, <b>happiness</b> <b>was</b> associated with positive disengaging emotions (e. g., pride in the self) – an independent profile – in situations that required personal goal pursuit and interpersonal influence; however, <b>happiness</b> <b>was</b> associated with positive engaging emotions (e. g., feelings of closeness) – an interdependent profile – in situations that required interpersonal harmony and adjustment. In contrast, such situational dependency was not observed for either mainland Japanese or Americans. For mainland Japanese <b>happiness</b> <b>was</b> associated with positive engaging emotions whereas for Americans <b>happiness</b> <b>was</b> associated with positive disengaging emotions...|$|R

When Alicia steals £500 worth of stock, Leyla accuses Amy but David defends her and Alicia admits it was her. Amy kisses David on the cheek {{to thank him for}} his support and misinterpreting his concern, makes further advances but runs away after David rejects her. When she comes home, she blackmails David and tells Victoria that she slept with him but later admits that she lied. Amy, Val and Eric move into their new home at the barn conversion but her <b>happiness</b> <b>is</b> short-lived as a young man from her past, Jared, tracks her down. He threatens to tell her new family and friends about her past and demands money to keep quiet until Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell) intervenes, realizing something is wrong. She tells Zak about her past and makes him promise to keep quiet. She pays Jared but when threatened by Zak, he reveals that Amy's affair with his father caused his family to break down. Zak makes Jared leave but Amy discovers she is pregnant and tells Cain, who demands she have a termination. Victoria suggests Amy tell Val but at the clinic, learns that her pregnancy is too advanced for a termination and the baby is due in December. She tells Belle Dingle (Eden Taylor-Draper) about the baby but insists that Belle keep it secret, scared of Cain's reaction. Amy gives birth to a baby boy in the church graveyard. Thinking he is dead, Amy wraps him in her jumper before leaving him in a telephone box and goes to David's house. She tells him what has happened and he learns that the baby has been found alive and taken to hospital. Knowing Amy needs medical attention, he waits for her to fall asleep and calls an ambulance, Val and Eric. At the hospital, she apologizes for keeping her pregnancy a secret and initially decides to keep the baby, now named Kyle, delighting Val and Eric. On Christmas Day 2011, Amy is bathing Kyle but freezes when she remembers her mother dropping her in the bath and giving her to social services. Amy runs away, leaving Kyle with Val, and confides in Victoria who helps her decide to give Kyle up for adoption. Val is upset by Amy's decision and that Eric is supporting her, making them drift apart. Val tries to win Amy back with a family trip to Portugal but goes alone and clears the bank account. Amy is upset when Eric begins dating Brenda Walker (Lesley Dunlop) and attempts to keep them apart; however, she realizes how happy Brenda makes Eric and supports the relationship.|$|E

25|$|The true {{human is}} an incorporeal contemplative {{capacity}} of the soul, and superior to all things corporeal. It then follows that real human <b>happiness</b> <b>is</b> independent of the physical world. Real <b>happiness</b> <b>is,</b> instead, dependent on the metaphysical and authentic human being found in this highest capacity of Reason. “For man, and especially the Proficient, is not the Couplement of Soul and body: the proof is that man can be disengaged from the body and disdain its nominal goods.” (Enneads I.4.14) The human who has achieved happiness will not be bothered by sickness, discomfort, etc., as his {{focus is on the}} greatest things. Authentic human <b>happiness</b> <b>is</b> the utilization of the most authentically human capacity of contemplation. Even in daily, physical action, the flourishing human’s “…Act is determined by the higher phase of the Soul.” (Enneads III.4.6) Even in the most dramatic arguments Plotinus considers (if the Proficient is subject to extreme physical torture, for example), he concludes this only strengthens his claim of true happiness being metaphysical, as the truly happy human being would understand that which is being tortured is merely a body, not the conscious self, and happiness could persist.|$|E

Thus, happiness predicts for lower mortality, which may partly be mediated by more physical activity and lower morbidity...|$|R
