Our group performed such studies under microgravity conditions on the International Space Station ISS over the last 12 years complementary to the work on ground. Low temperature plasma physics {{is the basis for}} this research and a large technological knowhow has been developed to build the space experiments at our institute. This special knowhow have been transferred to a new field of applied research, the so-called plasma medicine and plasma hygiene. Here, cold atmospheric plasmas (CAPs) are used to kill bacteria, virus, fungi or spores on sensitive surfaces like the human skin at atmospheric pressures. Due to the know-how of building space plasma devices our group was the first in the world that could design, built and qualify a plasma source for the use in clinical trials for the treatment of chronic wounds. The results were very convincing – the wounds were disinfected through the plasma treatment and even more promising, they showed faster wound healing. The applications of CAP in plasma medicine and plasma hygiene are vast and many ideas exist in the community. The plasma could even be used to decontaminate space hardware in terms of planetary protection. A recent study by DLR-ME and MPE showed that CAP could be a new alternative method to decontaminate space vehicles for exploration to moons or Mars. I will present an overview on the three main topics of our research: complex plasma on the ISS, application of CAP on ground in plasma medicine and hygiene and back to space with the application of the decontamination of space equipment.

Epidemic waves followed {{the introduction of}} every serotype (DEN 1 to 3), and reduction in susceptible individuals possibly accounted for decreasing case frequency.

In contrast, huge resources are obviously available, which are underused in the IT sector, similar as e. g. in the renewable energy sector. This is especially for grid with its fast turnover rates very astonishing considering the barriers for further development put forward by the inability to satisfy the need for such resources. The phenomenon is a typical example of the Inverse Tragedy of the Commons, i. e. resources are underexploited in contrast to the unsustainable and destructing overexploitation in the Classic Tragedy of the Commons. An analysis of IT and the grid sector which attempts to share resources for better usage efficiency, reveals two challenges, which lead {{to the heart of the}} paradox: i) From a macro perspective all grid infrastructures involve not only mere technical solutions but also dominantly all of the autopoietic social sub-systems ranging from religion to policy. ii) On the micro level the individual players and their psychology and risk behaviour are of major importance for acting within the macro autopoietic framework. Consequently, the challenges of grid implementation are similar to those of other pressing global issues as e. g. climate protection. This is well described by extending the Human Ecology triangle to a rectangle: invironment-individual-society-environment. By applying this extension of this classical field of <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>basic</b> and applied <b>research</b> to the grid sector, i. e. by further extension to an e-Human Grid Ecology rational, the Grid Inverse Tragedy of the Commons can be understood and approached regarding the internalization challenge into e-Society and e-Life, from which then guidelines for the day-to-day management can be derived.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{long known that}} firms can benefit {{substantially}} from <b>basic</b> <b>research.</b> Recently, however, the open innovation literature has questioned whether firms should conduct these <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> activities in-house and has suggested that outsourcing is more appropriate both for small and large firms. However, existing empirical work investigates the performance implications of R&D outsourcing in general, but {{does not take into}} account the differences between <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> on the one hand and more applied R&D on the other. This paper therefore studies whether outsourced <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> indeed contributes equally to firm productivity as in-house <b>basic</b> <b>research,</b> while explicitly incorporating the moderating effect of firm size. A production function approach is applied to firm-level data stemming from three waves of the Flemish R&D survey, combined with data from firms' annual accounts. The results show that small firms benefit from outsourcing their <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> activities. For medium-sized and large firms, however, in-house <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> is more productive than outsourced <b>basic</b> <b>research.</b> These results contradict the general belief that small firms benefit little from <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> and cast doubts on the recent trend to close medium-sized and large firms' corporate labs. status: publishe...|$|R
