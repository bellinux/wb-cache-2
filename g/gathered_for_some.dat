The passage was [...] very rapid, {{and the weather}} favourable. He had the honour, with [...] his wife and {{daughter}} and other companions of his voyage, to [...] receive an invitation to dine at Fredensborg on Monday. He found [...] there the entire circle of illustrious personages who have been [...] <b>gathered</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time in a family party, with a very few [...] exceptions. The singularly domestic character of this remarkable [...] assemblage, and the affectionate intimacy which appeared to [...] pervade it, made an impression upon him not less deep than the [...] demeanour of all its members, which was so kindly and so simple, [...] that even the word condescending could hardly be applied to it. [...] Nor must Mr. Gladstone allow himself to omit another striking [...] feature of the remarkable picture, in the unrestrained and [...] unbounded happiness of the royal children, nineteen in number, who [...] appeared like a single family reared under a single roof.|$|E
50|$|The sisters woke at 6:00 a.m. and {{organized}} their rooms. At 7:30 they {{gathered in the}} hospital chapel for a common rule of prayer followed by the reading of a gospel, an epistle, a psalm, and perhaps a brief sermon by the priest serving that day. The sisters departed from the chapel after receiving a blessing from the priest and greeting the mother superior. They then <b>gathered</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> tea before going to their daily obediences. Those who were not immediately needed at their obedience remained in the chapel for the Divine Liturgy.Sisters {{were responsible for the}} reading and chanting in both churches. The chant was generally of a simple monastic style, with concert singing very seldom used. The choir members also did handiwork in the community workshop, where all the clothing of the sisters was made.Following morning prayers, the sisters would be found at their various obediences: some in the hospital awaiting the doctors making rounds, others in the clinic to provide treatment such as massages, injections, etc., for the ailing, others in the school, and yet others in the kitchen or other areas of the house.Twice a week between the hours of 11:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. the spiritual father offered the sisters a lecture, one week on the catechism, and the following week one on the holy fathers. The sisters prepared for Holy Communion at least four times a year during the major fasts, though they were allowed to receive more often if they wished.At 12:30 lunch was served with the reading {{of the life of the}} saint of the day during the meal. Meals were prepared in accordance with church fasting rules. Tea was served at 4:00 p.m. followed by vespers and matins at 5:00 p.m. Sisters who have completed their obediences were present at these services. Before feast days and Sundays, all-night vigils were held. At 7:30 p.m. dinner was served. There was common evening prayer at 9:00 p.m. in the hospital chapel. The sisters retired to their cells following prayer, receiving a blessing from the superior as they departed. By 10:30 p.m. all prepare for sleep, and by 11:00 p.m. there was quiet and all lights were extinguished.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The National Child Development Study (NCDS) originated in the Perinatal Mortality Survey (see SN 5565), which examined social and obstetric factors associated with still birth and infant mortality among over 17, 000 babies born in Britain in one week in March 1958. Surviving members of this birth cohort have been surveyed on eight further occasions in order to monitor their changing health, education, social and economic circumstances - in 1965 at age 7, 1969 at age 11, 1974 at age 16 (the first three sweeps are also held under SN 5565), 1981 (age 23 - SN 5566), 1991 (age 33 - SN 5567), 1999 / 2000 (age 41 / 2 - SN 5578), 2004 - 2005 (age 46 / 47 - SN 5579), 2008 - 2009 (age 50 - SN 6137) and 2013 (age 55 - SN 7669). There have also been surveys of sub-samples of the cohort, the most recent occurring in 1995 (age 37), when a 10 % representative sub-sample was assessed for difficulties with basic skills (SN 4992). Finally, during 2002 - 2004, 9, 340 NCDS cohort members participated in a bio-medical survey, carried out by qualified nurses (SN 5594, available under more restrictive Special Licence access conditions; see catalogue record for details). The bio-medical survey did not cover any of the topics included in the 2004 / 2005 survey. Further NCDS data separate to the main surveys include a response and deaths dataset, parent migration studies, employment, activity and partnership histories, behavioural studies and essays - see the NCDS series page for details. Further information about the NCDS {{can be found on}} the Centre for Longitudinal Studies website. The Warnock Study of Handicapped School Leavers, 1976 was carried out in the summer and autumn of 1976, with selected members of the NCDS when they were 18 years of age. Information was <b>gathered</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> 508 individuals, both handicapped and non-handicapped. The study was carried out for the Committee of Enquiry into the Education of Handicapped Children and Young People (the Warnock Committee) by a team based at the National Children's Bureau. The central aim of the study was to provide information on how handicapped young people negotiated the crucial transition from school to work, the employment opportunities available to them and to describe their early experiences in the labour market. For the second edition (February 2012), the Centre for Longitudinal Studies made improvements to the existing data and documentation, including revised variable names, addition of variable and value labels and missing values, and the addition of an identifier variable. For full details, see the documentation. Main Topics : The purpose of the study was to describe some early labour market experiences of handicapped young people. The questionnaire covered areas such as: education, leaving school, employment, income, health and household composition...|$|E

40|$|This book is {{intended}} as the course-booklet for a course {{sponsored by the}} Union of Monastic Superiors. The participants <b>gather</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> initial lectures, and then depart with the books and study on their own. The questions {{at the end of}} each chapter are intended for essays to be sent in for comment; but they will still be useful as a focus for private study. The book is obviously not intended as a continuous commentary on the text of the gospel. Rather it is a series of snapshots or of probes on particular topics. I hope these will give an orientation which will guide the reader into a deeper understanding of the evangelist’s approach, giving an insight into the message, and so making it easier to read and appreciate the Good News of Jesus which the evangelist brings to us. Some justification should be given for the topics chosen and the order in which they are presented. Before the gospel istself is approached, a preliminary chapter is necessary, discussing the context of the world in which the evangelist wrote. Specifically on Matthew, a preliminary chapter investigates the methods and literary techniques which are characteristic of the evangelist and constitute, so to speak, his personal finger-print. Only after this is it appropriate to discuss the material on which Matthew was working, an...|$|R

40|$|Background: Laryngeal airway {{narrowing}} from subglottic stenosis (SGS) may be congenital or acquired, {{with many}} SGS cases acquired following intubation or laryngotracheal injury. Two main approaches to reconstructive surgical management exist: laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR) and partial cricotracheal resection (CTR). LTR and CTR procedures have been undertaken in Glasgow {{since the early}} 1980 s. A retrospective audit of parents’ perspectives on {{quality of life for}} their children showed parental concerns related to breathing, respiratory tract infection and voice quality; in addition to concerns relating to independence and the ability to lead a normal life. This study evaluated in detail a range of vocal parameters in children over the age of 5 who have had LTR/CTR at the hospital in Glasgow. Methods: 21 % of the existing cohort of children who had LTR or CTR at the hospital opted {{to take part in the}} study. Awake laryngoscopy and voice recordings using a standard protocol were taken for each participant and prepared for a range of acoustic and perceptual analyses and comparison to available normative data. Parent and child perspectives on voice related quality of life were also <b>gathered.</b> Results: <b>For</b> <b>some</b> children there were normal laryngoscopy ratings along with aspects of normally evaluated voice. For others voice quality remains impaired. These will be presented in relation to the laryngoscopy and voice data. Conclusion: <b>For</b> <b>some</b> children, normal voice is a potential outcome following LTR/CTR and this finding is of particular value for professionals supporting young children about to have LTR or CTR procedures...|$|R
40|$|In a 21 cm neutral {{hydrogen}} {{survey of}} approximately 55 deg 2 {{out to a}} redshift of cz = 8340 km s − 1, we have identified 75 extragalactic HI sources. These objects comprise a well-defined sample of extragalactic sources chosen by means that are independent of optical surface brightness selection effects. In this paper we describe the Arecibo survey procedures and HI data, follow-up VLA HI observations made of several unusual sources, and Kitt Peak B-, R-, and I-band photometry for {{nearly all of the}} galaxies. We have also <b>gathered</b> information <b>for</b> <b>some</b> of the optically detected galaxies within the same search volume. We examine how samples generated by different types of search techniques overlap with selection by HI flux. Only the least massive HI object, which is among the lowest mass HI sources previously found, does not have a clear optical counterpart, but a nearby bright star may hide low surface brightness emission. However the newly-detected systems do have unusual optical properties. Most of the 40 galaxies that were not previously identified in magnitude-limited catalogs appear to be gas-dominated systems, and several of these systems have HI mass-to-light ratios among the largest values ever previously found. These gas-dominated objects also tend to have very blue colors, low surface brightnesses, and no central bulges, which correlate strongly with their relative star-to-gas content...|$|R

She could peer out of her little window and see dark, silent forms come up from the ravine at the back of the cabin, and leave the same way. None of them went round to the front door, where Bate Wood smoked and kept guard. Joan was able to hear only scraps of these earnest talks; and from part of one she <b>gathered</b> that <b>for</b> <b>some</b> reason or other Kells desired to bring himself into notice. Alder Creek must be made to know that a man of importance had arrived. It seemed to Joan that this was the very last thing which Kells ought to do. What magnificent daring the bandit had! Famous years before in California--with a price set upon his life in Nevada--and now the noted, if unknown, leader of border robbers in Idaho, he sought to make himself prominent, respected, and powerful.
