In this paper, we examined the social responsibility performance of higher educational institutions in Nigeria. Four research questions were asked to produce the findings that: (1) <b>host</b> <b>communities</b> rate the institutions moderate in their social responsibility performance,(2) the most acknowledged social responsibility of the institutions by the communities is the offer of concessionary admission to indigenes of <b>host</b> <b>communities,</b> (3) <b>host</b> <b>communities</b> expect special employment opportunities from the institutions and (4) that the level of satisfaction of the communities regarding social responsibility of the institutions is very low. The paper concludes that higher institutions should boost their relationship with <b>host</b> <b>communities</b> through increased response to social issues...|$|R

These modes of incorporation affect how a child will assimilate into U.S. society, and determine how vulnerable the child will be towards downward assimilation. Factors that enhance such vulnerability include racial discrimination, location, {{and changes in the}} economy that have made it harder for intergenerational mobility.|$|E

Compared to the wider region, the Kakuma camp has better health facilities and a higher percentage of children in full-time education, which resulted in a general notion that the refugees were better off than the locals. The <b>host</b> <b>community</b> is composed largely of nomadic pastoralists who stick to their traditions and don't co-operate with refugees. Camp is becoming a normal part of the regional socio-economic landscape and a part of livelihood options available in the region.

25|$|Parasite ecology is complex, usually {{involving}} hosts {{that have}} multiple parasites (multi-parasite hosts), parasites that have multiple hosts (multi-host parasites), and competition within a host. These interactions affect parasite and host reproduction and therefore evolution, including of the virulence of parasites and of methods of transmission. Reviewing the field, T. Rigaud and colleagues noted in 2010 {{that among the}} outcomes demonstrated empirically are that multiple infection can affect virulence, and can trigger evolutionary change; that the parasites involved in the same host may have contrasting transmission modes; and that assemblages of multiple parasites can be more virulent than would be expected from each individual parasite. Rigaud and colleagues also consider trade-offs of virulence among hosts (that adaptation for higher virulence in one host means lower virulence in others), predicting that when there are many hosts, the outcome will be non-specialist parasites with relatively low virulence. Where hosts differ in quality, Rigaud and colleagues predict that parasites should become optimally virulent in their primary host. On the other hand, they also predict that the more diverse the <b>host</b> <b>community,</b> the lower the incidence of parasites should be, because infecting hosts that are unsuitable or resistant means the loss of those parasites (wasted transmission).|$|E

[...] He defended Muslims in Britain, saying that [...] "we live in peace with the <b>host</b> <b>community,</b> we are not allowed to target people here", and claimed that the police had inspected and allowed the controversial placards used in the demonstration. [...] Choudary was criticised by his fellow panellists, who included Ann Cryer, then MP for Keighley, Humera Khan, of the al-Nisa Muslim Women's Group (who accused him of demonising Islam), Sayeeda Warsi, the vice-chair of the Conservative Party, Professor Tariq Ramadan (who claimed that Choudary's actions were designed to evoke a strong response from the media), and Roger Knapman, the leader of the UK Independence Party. [...] On 15 March 2006 he was among five men arrested in connection with the demonstration, which had been organised by al Ghurabaa. [...] He was arrested again on 4 May at Stansted Airport for an alleged breach of bail, and charged with organising the protest without notifying police.

40|$|Abstract. The Kinabalu Park in Sabah (Malaysian-Borneo) {{represents}} multiple tourism {{opportunities for}} its stakeholders, <b>host</b> <b>communities</b> and tourists.

The designated study area includes villages nearby Kinabalu Park. Through the popularity of the park and various other attractions within the area, tourism activities contributes to socio-cultural impacts towards its <b>host</b> <b>communities.</b> The perceptions and attitudes of the locals towards tourism are identified and evaluated. By having the input of <b>host</b> <b>communities</b> as part of conserving tourism whilst meeting certain principles of sustainable tourism, the paper aims to attain interesting findings about the perceptions of the <b>host</b> <b>communities</b> towards socio-cultural impacts of tourism on their community. The paper further aims to recommend for the continuous improvement of sustainable tourism development at Kinabalu Park and its surroundings. ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{first major}} job that faced the {{development}} committee was finding and selecting a suitable {{site for a}} 700 unit housing project in northern New Jersey. The United States Housing Authority provided two site selection experts, and the New Jersey State Planning Commission provided assistance throughout the site selecting process. The final location had to be relatively inexpensive to purchase, be located near major utility networks for water, gas, electric and sewer connections, and be in a financially stable <b>host</b> <b>community</b> with underutilized public facilities and services. Major urban areas in northern New Jersey were eliminated early {{because there were no}} plots of land large enough for the project. The marshy rural areas near the shipyards were also found to be unacceptable early on. Quickly the committee began focusing its attention on the surrounding suburban communities, which were very popular among its work constituency. [...] Suburban communities, however, lacked financial stability, because they lacked the industrial rateables necessary to keep residential property taxes low. [...] The people of these prospective host communities were also frightened that the new project would be a direct liability rather than an asset for their towns.|$|E
2500|$|Sex {{trafficking}} victims face {{threats of}} violence from many sources, including customers, pimps, brothel owners, madams, traffickers, and corrupt local law enforcement officials. Raids as an anti-sex trafficking measure have to potential to help, and also to protect sex trafficked victims. Because of their potentially complicated legal status and their potential language barriers, the arrest or fear of arrest creates stress and other emotional trauma for trafficking victims. Victims may also experience physical violence from law enforcement during raids. The challenges facing victims often continue of course, after their experience of [...] "rescue" [...] or removal from coercive sexual exploitation. In addition to coping with their past traumatic experiences, former trafficking victims often experience social alienation in the host and home countries. Stigmatization, social exclusion, and intolerance often {{make it difficult for}} former victims to integrate into their <b>host</b> <b>community,</b> or to reintegrate into their former community. Accordingly, one of the central aims of protection assistance, is the promotion of (re)integration. Too often however, governments and large institutional donors offer little funding to support the provision of assistance and social services to former trafficking victims. As the victims are also pushed into drug trafficking, many of them face criminal sanctions also.|$|E
