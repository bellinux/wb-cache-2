Consequently, investment in rice production decreased and {{a major portion of}} the land shifted to the cultivation of perennial tree crops and seasonal crops.

5|$|Work {{performed}} by slaves falls into five general categories: domestic, with epitaphs recording at least 55 different household jobs; imperial or public service; urban crafts and services; agriculture; and mining. Convicts provided {{much of the}} labour in the mines or quarries, where conditions were notoriously brutal. In practice, there was little division of labour between slave and free, and most workers were illiterate and without special skills. The greatest number of common labourers were employed in agriculture: in the Italian system of industrial farming (latifundia), these may have been mostly slaves, but throughout the Empire, slave <b>farm</b> <b>labour</b> was probably less important than other forms of dependent labour by people who were technically not enslaved.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Calais, factors outside of Edward's control forced him to wind down the war effort. In 1348, the Black Death struck England with full force, killing a third {{or more of the}} country's population. This loss of {{manpower}} led to a shortage of <b>farm</b> <b>labour,</b> and a corresponding rise in wages. The great landowners struggled with the shortage of manpower and the resulting inflation in labour cost. To curb the rise in wages, the king and parliament responded with the Ordinance of Labourers in 1349, followed by the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempts to regulate wages could not succeed in the long run, but in the short term they were enforced with great vigour. All in all, the plague did not lead to a full-scale breakdown of government and society, and recovery was remarkably swift. This was to a large extent thanks to the competent leadership of royal administrators such as Treasurer William Edington and Chief Justice William de Shareshull.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the most}} {{immediate}} consequences of the Black Death in England was a shortage of <b>farm</b> <b>labour,</b> and a corresponding rise in wages. The medieval world-view was unable to interpret these changes in terms of socio-economic development, and it became common to blame degrading morals instead. The landowning classes saw the rise in wage levels {{as a sign of}} social upheaval and insubordination, and reacted with coercion. In 1349, King Edward III passed the Ordinance of Labourers, fixing wages at pre-plague levels. The ordinance was reinforced by Parliament's passing of the Statute of Labourers in 1351. The labour laws were enforced with ruthless determination over the following decades.|$|E

The wars were an outcome of constant friction between the Bapedi and the Boers, who claimed that Bapedi carrying arms were continually stealing livestock, whilst the Bapedi claimed that neighbouring Boer settlers stole children to be forced into <b>farm</b> <b>labour.</b> Further friction was caused by the refusal of Sekukuni to allow prospectors to search for gold in territory he considered to be sovereign and independent under his authority. The First Sekukuni War of 1876 was conducted by the Boers, and the two separate campaigns of the Second Sekukuni War of 1878/1879 were conducted by the British.|$|E

Of 1,450,000 prisoners, 750,000 were employed in agricultural labour and 330,000 in industry. As able-bodied men were at the front, the lack of manpower was felt in all European belligerents and especially in Germany. The armaments industry, agriculture and mines were the three branches concerned. Prisoners of war represented an indispensable segment of the workforce.
