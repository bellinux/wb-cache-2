Plaintiffs sued in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri under 42 U.S.C. 1981, 1982, 1983, and 2000e, alleging that a race-based denial of a home purchase violated federal civil rights laws, especially the requirement in 42 U.S.C. 1982 that: ‘All citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.’” ...|$|E

50|$|Quite {{a number}} of Nikolsburg Jews {{continued}} to earn their livelihood in Vienna, where they were permitted to stay for some time on special passports. The <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence,</b> which was conceded to the Jews in Austria in 1848, {{reduced the number of}} resident Jews in Nikolsburg to less than one-third of the population which it contained {{at the time of its}} highest development.

In 1938, prior to the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the city population totaled about 8,000 mostly German-speaking inhabitants. Out of these, 472 were Jewish at this time. The Jewish settlement in Nikolsburg ceased to exist during World War II, as only 110 managed to emigrate in time, and 327 of Mikulov's Jews did not survive the Holocaust.|$|E
5000|$|The machinations of {{the clergy}} were checked by Casimir IV the Jagiellonian (1447 - 1492).

To a Jewish deputation from the communities of Poznań, Kalisz, Sieradz, Łęczyca, Brest, and Wladislavov which applied to him for the renewal of the charter, he said in his new grant: [...] "We desire that the Jews, whom we protect especially {{for the sake of our}} own interests and those of the royal treasury, shall feel contented during our prosperous reign." [...] In confirming all previous rights and privileges of the Jews: the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> and trade; judicial and communal autonomy; the inviolability of person and property; and protection against arbitrary accusation and attacks; the charter of Casimir IV was a determined protest against the canonical laws, which had been recently renewed for Poland by the Council of Kalisz, and for the entire Catholic world by the Diet of Basel. The charter, moreover, permitted more interaction between Jews and Christians, and freed the former from the jurisdiction of the clerical courts. Strong opposition was created by the King's liberal attitude toward the Jews, and was voiced by the leaders of the clerical party.|$|E

It demarcates three distributive values – adequacy, equality, and benefitting the less advantaged.

40|$|Initially, the European Union had {{a purely}} {{economic}} connotation, as his intent was the {{free movement of}} factors of production, {{in order to create}} a competitive internal market and achieving a rational distribution of resources. For this reason, the individual was seen simply as a worker and for this purpose the first aspects that are disciplined within the EU are those contained in this sphere. In the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community (EEC), the freedom of free movement was reserved for only a few special categories of workers, who were active subjects economically, since what resulted essential at the time was the creation of an internal market. Later the Maastricht Treaty, on one side marks the transition from the EEC to the EU, on the other presents for the first time the "European citizenship", making the free movement an autonomous right of every citizen belonging to a Member State. In this way the free movement is exercised not only for the economic purposes of the Treaties. In December 2000 the Charter of Fundamental Rights or the Charter of Nice was compiled and signed, which defines that the EU seeks to promote a balanced development and ensures free movement of persons, goods, services and capital, and also the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence.</b> Main objective of this manuscript is an analysis of the differences and similarities between the EU and non-EU citizens...|$|E
40|$|From the {{passport}} regime {{to the freedom}} of movement Migration doctrine of the soviet period as a system of official views and regulations, as a leading political principle was based on {{the passport}} system, labour legislation and housing policy. The soviet model of industrialization with its orientation on labour-intensive sectors of national economy, labour division between large economic regions and leveling of economical development in the republics of the USSR was accompanied by acceleration of labour resources mobility. The large-scale state programmes were spread out for regulating of the migration flows. The organized recruitment of workers and agricultural resettling of families were the most efficient ones. The system of professional and regional differentiation of wages and salaries was created for attraction of workers to regions with a lack of labour resources. But the main instrument of controlling and regulating of migration flows in the USSR remained during the soviet period without change: it was the passport system but not economic policy, human rights and civil freedoms. The <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> choice was brought to naught. The migration doctrine has radically changed in Ukraine after the dissolution of the USSR. In January 1994, the Ukranian Parliament adopted the Law "On the Procedure of Exit from and Entry into Ukraine by Citizens of Ukraine " that guaranteed the right to leave the Ukraine and to return in without restriction. This law burst the old order. With its adoption the article 11 of Law of Ukraine "On Employment " admitting the labour or undertaking activity of Ukranian citizens during their stay abroad acquired the additional force.
