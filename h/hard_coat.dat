25|$|Pollen {{is a fine}} to coarse powdery {{substance}} comprising pollen grains which are male microgametophytes of seed plants, which produce male gametes (sperm cells). Pollen grains have a <b>hard</b> <b>coat</b> made of sporopollenin that protects the gametophytes {{during the process of}} their movement from the stamens to the pistil of flowering plants or from the male cone to the female cone of coniferous plants. If pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone, it germinates, producing a pollen tube that transfers the sperm to the ovule containing the female gametophyte. Individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to see detail. The study of pollen is called palynology and is highly useful in paleoecology, paleontology, archaeology, and forensics.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} has experimentally investigated the influence on vibration characteristics of thin cantilever cylindrical shell (TCS) with <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> under cantilever boundary condition. Firstly, the theoretical model of TCS with <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> is established to calculate its natural frequencies and modal shapes {{so as to}} roughly understand vibration characteristic of TCS when it is <b>coated</b> with <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> material. Then, by considering its nonlinear stiffness and damping influences, an experiment system is established to accurately measure vibration parameters of the shell, and the corresponding test methods and identification techniques are also proposed. Finally, {{based on the measured}} data, the influences on natural frequencies, modal shapes, damping ratios, and vibration responses of TCS with <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> are analyzed and discussed in detail. It can be found that <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> can {{play an important role in}} vibration reduction of TCS, and for the most modes of TCS, <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> will result in the decrease of natural frequencies, but the decreased level is not very big, and its damping effects on the higher frequency range of the shell are weak and ineffective. Therefore, in order to make better use of this coating material, we must carefully choose the concerned antivibration frequency range of the shell; otherwise it may lead to some negative effects...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{nonlinear}} vibration {{mechanism of}} <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> thin plate based on macroscopic vibration theory and proposes finite element iteration method (FEIM) to theoretically calculate its nature frequency and vibration response. First of all, strain dependent mechanical property of <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> is briefly introduced and polynomial {{method is adopted}} to characterize the storage and loss modulus of coating material. Then, the principle formulas of inherent and dynamic response characteristics of the <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> composite plate are derived.

Finally, a composite plate coated with MgO + Al 2 O 3 is taken as a study object and both nonlinear vibration test and analysis are conducted on the plate specimen with considering strain dependent mechanical parameters of <b>hard</b> <b>coating.</b> Through comparing the resulting frequency and response results, the practicability and reliability of FEIM have been verified and the corresponding analysis results can provide an important reference for further study on nonlinear vibration mechanism of <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> composite structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{parameters of}} <b>hard</b> <b>coating,</b> such as storage modulus and loss factor, {{are affected by}} preparation technology significantly and have the strain dependent characteristic. So the effective identification of these mechanical parameters becomes a challenge task. In this study, a hard-coating cantilever thin plate under base excitation was taken as the research object, and an inverse method was developed to identify these mechanical parameters. Firstly, the principles of identifying storage modulus and loss factor of <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> were presented according to the inverse method. Then, from the need of parameters identification, the analytical model and calculation formula of equivalent strain for the hard-coating composite plate were derived. Next, also for parameter identification, the vibration experiments about the cantilever plate coated with NiCoCrAlY+ yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> were performed. Finally, the mechanical parameters of NiCoCrAlY+YSZ <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> with strain dependent characteristic were identified by the proposed method. The identification {{results show that the}} change rules of storage modulus and loss factor of <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> with the strain amplitude are almost consistent with the results listed in the other similar references.

The tail does not curl over the back, but is held upright when the dog is active.

It is the whitest white you can conceive of, and the blindingest. A Bermuda house does not look like marble; it is a much intenser white than that; and, besides, there is a dainty, indefinable something else about its look that is not marble-like. We put in a great deal of solid talk and reflection over this matter of trying to find a figure that would describe the unique white of a Bermuda house, and we contrived to hit upon it at last. It is exactly the white of the icing of a cake, and has the same unemphasized and scarcely perceptible polish. The white of marble is modest and retiring compared with it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. PVD <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> is a {{well-known}} surface treatment technology for steels to improve wear resistance and, to some extent, corrosion resistance. In principle, <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> {{can be carried out}} for Al alloys, but due to the natural oxide layer and the insufficient load-bearing capacity of the soft base material, the application of this technology for wear protection of components is not regarded as being particularly promising. The research activities described in this paper focused on electron beam (EB) surface alloying with a Co-based additive, and the influence of two different hardness levels (270 HV 0. 1 and 390 HV 0. 1) on the improvement of the local load-bearing capacity of Al alloys with thin PVD hard coatings. A further focus of this research was on the material-specific aspects of the coating deposition. Compared to steels, the <b>hard</b> <b>coated</b> surface of Al alloys is rougher and the measured adhesion of the coating is significantly lower. For this purpose, different technological PVD parameters (e. g. Ti interlayer, deposition temperature, and time) were adapted to optimize the coating properties – especially adhesion. The paper deals with comparative studies of single (PVD <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> of Al base material) and duplex treatment (EB alloying of Al base material and subsequent PVD <b>hard</b> <b>coating)</b> by means of improvement of the coating and com-pound hardness, friction and wear behavior (pin-on-disc test), as well as the corrosion resistance (potentiodynamic measurements in 0. 05 M H 2 SO 4). While the level of improvement in wear resistance {{as a result of the}} duplex treatments strongly depended on the adhesion of the thin coatings, the corrosion behavior was strongly influenced by the PVD deposition process and coating thickness...|$|R
