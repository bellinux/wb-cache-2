2500|$|Sandwiched {{between the}} canal and the River Lud is a sewage {{treatment}} plant. The treated effluent is discharged into the canal below the lock site. Beyond the works are Alvingham Fisheries, {{and then a}} bridge which carries Lock Road over the canal. Alvingham Lock has two semi-circular <b>drain</b> <b>openings</b> in its western wall, and an inverted syphon carries water from the River Lud under the lock, to feed the mill pond for Alvingham Mill. The canal then passes the church of St Mary, once the chapel for a Gilbertine Priory, which dates from the eleventh to fourteenth centuries. It was the parish church for North Cockerington, and is Grade I listed. In the same churchyard is the parish church of St Adelwold, also Grade I listed, and build in the thirteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The churches separate Alvingham Water Mill from the canal. The present building was constructed in 1782 by John Maddison, with extensions in 1900, and it was restored in 1972. Most of the machinery, including an [...] diameter breast shot water wheel, dates from 1782, and was in regular use following restoration. The building replaced an earlier structure, as a water mill {{is known to have}} existed on the site since 1155. Water from the mill stream flows into Westfield Drain and returns to the canal a little further downstream. This is only possible because of the lowered water levels in the canal. Before closure to navigation, there was another inverted syphon under the canal, which returned the water to the River Lud, but this has been blocked up and abandoned.|$|E
50|$|Home remedy drain {{cleaners}} include {{boiling water}} poured into <b>drain</b> <b>openings</b> to clear soap and hair clogs; or, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) poured into a drain, followed by vinegar.|$|E
50|$|Advantages of {{chemical}} drain cleaners include ready availability of some formulations through retailer stores and potential {{ease of use}} for removing soft hair and grease clogs that accumulate close the <b>drain</b> <b>openings.</b>|$|E
50|$|If a {{blockage}} {{is present}} in the puncti, doctors may suggest a procedure called punctoplasty, performed to widen the <b>drain</b> <b>opening.</b> This usually takes 20-30 minutes and is performed under local anesthesia.|$|R
50|$|Handheld drain augers are {{typically}} designed to clean portions of a drain within 8 metres (25 ft) of the <b>drain</b> <b>opening.</b> The cable of a handheld drain auger is driven into a drain by the mechanical force created when the operator rotates a drum that anchors the cable.|$|R
5000|$|Fatalities have {{occurred}} around drains {{as a result}} of this [...] "suction entrapment." [...] In these situations, a portion of the body, hair, or clothing may become stuck against the drain and may become impossible to release, resulting in drowning. Properly designed drains in swimming pools and spas mitigate this effect by either adding multiple drains, or increasing the surface area of the <b>drain</b> <b>opening,</b> with the use of many holes or safety covers. Since drain suction increases rapidly when a portion of the <b>drain</b> <b>opening</b> is blocked, having two drains or a larger drain inlet allows alternate suction paths for the pump. Swimming pool safety devices are available to automatically turn off an operating pump if a rapid increase in suction is detected (as could happen during a suction entrapment incident).|$|R
50|$|Air burst drain {{cleaners}} use accelerated carbon dioxide, air {{or other}} gas to rupture the clog membrane. Accelerated gas creates a force on standing water that can dislodge clogs that accumulate close to <b>drain</b> <b>openings.</b>|$|E
50|$|If {{a single}} sink, toilet, or tub or shower drain is clogged {{the first choice}} is {{normally}} a drain cleaner that can remove soft obstructions such as hair and grease clogs that can accumulate close to interior <b>drain</b> <b>openings.</b> Chemical drain cleaners, plungers, handheld drain augers, air burst drain cleaners, and home remedy drain cleaners are intended for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|As mentioned, {{the area}} beneath a spray pool {{typically}} has <b>drain</b> <b>openings</b> {{so that the}} water it produces will not flood the surrounding landscape. In some instances, the water collected in these drains is recycled back into the spray mechanism, thereby conserving water. Additionally, the water emanating from the spray nozzles is continually drawn from a fresh water supply as previously mentioned.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{of three}} storeys, the small North, or Stem, Tower {{was reduced to}} two storeys in 1693. The upper chamber had a fireplace, while the lower chamber was a pit prison. Accessed only from a trap-door above, this chamber has a <b>drain</b> <b>opening</b> to the sea, which washes in at high tide.|$|R
50|$|For {{the common}} plunger, the cup is pushed {{down against the}} <b>drain</b> <b>opening,</b> either {{pressing}} hard into the drain to force air in, or pushing down until the rubber cup is flattened and then pulling out, creating a vacuum that attracts material. The intent is to loosen or break up a blockage caused by excessive material in the drain.|$|R
50|$|If {{more than}} one {{plumbing}} fixture is clogged the first choice is normally a drain cleaner that can remove soft or hard obstructions along {{the entire length of}} the drain, from the <b>drain</b> <b>opening</b> through the main sewer drain to the lateral piping outside the building. Electric drain cleaners and sewer jetters are intended for this purpose.|$|R
50|$|The {{church of}} St Mary at Portchester survives, inside the Roman wall of Porchester Castle, {{returned}} to parochial use. It is substantially a Norman building, {{and hence the}} one the priory originally used. No trace of the conventual buildings survive above ground except for some <b>drain</b> <b>openings</b> and the marks of the abutment of the cloister against the south wall of the nave.|$|E
50|$|Advantages of {{air burst}} drain {{cleaners}} include {{the potential to}} immediately clear clogs and slow-running drains, in contrast to chemical cleaners that can take more time to work. Air burst cleaners can dislodge obstructions that are further away from <b>drain</b> <b>openings</b> than can a plunger, and {{in contrast to a}} drain augers do not risk scratching the ceramic surfaces of sinks, bathtubs and toilets.|$|E
50|$|While {{technically}} {{listed as}} amphibious, the Gama Goat's swimming capability {{was limited to}} smooth water crossings of ponds, canals and streams due to the very low freeboard {{and the lack of}} a propeller. Propulsion in the water was supplied by the six spinning wheels, and bilge pumps were standard equipment. Drivers had to remember to close the hull's <b>drain</b> <b>openings</b> before swimming the vehicles. Some models had extra equipment installed that made them too heavy to swim, such as heavy-duty winches, communications shelters that made them top heavy, or radar gear.|$|E
50|$|Suspect drains can be {{identified}} by placing a glass jar or taping a clear plastic bag over them, and periodically checking for adult flies. A clear plastic cup coated inside with vegetable oil or petroleum jelly can also be used. Partially covering the <b>drain</b> <b>opening</b> with sticky adhesive tape is another method used to identify breeding sources.|$|R
50|$|Fox, Ash, and Kylie {{slip into}} Bean's farm. Ash frees Kristofferson and braves enemy fire {{to release a}} rabid beagle named Spitz to keep the farmers at bay. The animals become {{accustomed}} to living in the sewers with others considering moving in (including Kristofferson's father who Fox and Felicity learn is getting better). Ash and Kristofferson settle their differences and become good friends. Fox leads his family, Kylie, and Agnes to a <b>drain</b> <b>opening</b> built into {{the floor of a}} supermarket owned by the three farmers.|$|R
50|$|Liquid {{formulations}} of corrosive alkaline drain cleaners can contain sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and lye (sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide) in concentrations up to 50 percent. Other corrosive mixtures come as two-part cleaners that are mixed {{as they are}} poured in the <b>drain</b> <b>opening.</b> Inside the <b>drain</b> the two solutions react to release a gas, and surfactants trap the gas as dense foam. The intent of this foaming action is to coat {{the inside of the}} drain pipe to dislodge more of the substances that form the clog. Because liquid alkaline drain cleaners are essentially a base dissolved in water, this is denser than water and can sink to the source of the clog.|$|R

50|$|Disadvantages of {{chemical}} drain cleaners include {{a lack of}} effectiveness for removing clogs far from the <b>drain</b> <b>opening</b> (for example, clogs that occur in toilets or in the main sewer drain), an inability to remove most solid obstructions, and the safety considerations outlined below.Danger arises from chemical drain cleaners' potential to injure eyes, lungs, and skin; and damage to clothing and household materials such as wood, paint, aluminum, and fiberglass. Chemical drain cleaners should be used only according to the manufacturer's instructions, as other use may cause injury. Strongly corrosive and acid drain cleaners {{are among the most}} hazardous household products available to the public. Chemical drain cleaners can cause strong reactions—sometimes explosively—with other chemicals that may have been used previously, which can result in serious injury to anyone in the vicinity.|$|R
60|$|Placing the {{umbrella}} {{in such a}} position that it came {{between himself and the}} bull, he laid himself flat down in the <b>drain.</b> The <b>opening</b> was far too narrow to admit his broad shoulders, except when turned sidewise. The same treatment was not applicable to other parts of his person, but, by dint of squeezing and collapsing, he got down, nestled under the bank, and lay still.|$|R
500|$|Ballcourt B1 is {{immediately}} {{south of the}} Group B plaza, with the northern entrance to the ballcourt directly accessing the plaza itself. It is an enclosed sunken ballcourt, as was common in the Maya highlands during the Late Postclassic. The ballcourt is aligned north-south with two transverse end zones forming a capital I shape. The ballcourt has two entrances {{in the form of}} inset stairways in the end zones, in the centre of the ballcourt's north and south walls. The side walls of the playing alley are slightly sloped and are topped by a cornice; the playing alley is flanked by two low benches set against the east and west walls. The end zones also possess sloping walls. All the ballcourt walls were built of large stones. The ballcourt playing area measures [...] north-south and is [...] wide between the benches. The end zones measure [...] east-west. The ballcourt was originally coated in stucco painted in a variety of colours; very little of this coating now remains. A <b>drain</b> <b>opening</b> empties runoff rainwater from {{the east side of the}} northern end zone; the drain continues under Platform B 2 and empties outside the retaining wall of Group B.|$|R
50|$|In Central Asia, human {{disturbances}} {{are minimal}} as {{this area has}} a harsher environment and is more sparsely populated. In {{this part of the}} world, bears may be found in steppe, which is sparser and more desert-like than grassland habitats in North America that occur at similar latitudes, and some bears may live out their lives even in desert edge, such as those that live in the Middle East (Syrian bears) and the rare Gobi bear which is native only to the Chinese-Mongolian desert of its name and isolated from other populations. Alpine meadows are the typical habitat in the Himalayan and Tibetan populations of brown bear. In Siberia, the species seems well-adapted to living in almost all parts of the extensive pine forests, usually coming to waterways or poorly <b>drained</b> <b>openings</b> and bogs while feeding and sheltering in broad roots and trunks in the interior. Eastern Russian forests hold arguably the largest number of brown bears in the world outside of possibly Alaska and northwestern Canada. The brown bears of Hokkaido are also largely forest dwelling, but dwell in mixed forests dominated by broadleaf trees such as beech.|$|R
50|$|The {{lacrimal}} lake is {{the pool of}} tears in the lower conjunctival cul-de-sac, which <b>drains</b> into the <b>opening</b> of the tear drainage system (the puncta lacrimalia). The volume of the {{lacrimal lake}} has been estimated to be between 7 and 10 µL.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} opening tidal {{barriers}} (floodgates) upon water table levels and lateral transport of solutes adjacent drains was investigated at two sites on a coastal floodplain. The sites had contrasting geomorphology, soil texture and sediment hydraulic properties. The site with lower hydraulic conductivity (0. 3 – 0. 9 m day− 1) soils (Romiaka) {{also had a}} higher elevation and hydraulic gradients towards the <b>drain.</b> While floodgate <b>opening</b> at Romiaka enhanced the amplitude of pre-existing tidal interaction with adjacent shallow groundwater, altered hydraulic gradients and caused some salt seepage, lateral solute movement from the drain was highly attenuated (3 ̆c 103 ̆em). The site with very high hydraulic conductivity soils (Shark Creek; 3 ̆e 125 m day− 1) had a lower elevation and seasonally fluctuating hydraulic gradients. The introduction of a tidal pressure signal into the <b>drain</b> by <b>opening</b> the floodgate at Shark Creek caused tidal forcing of groundwater over 300 m from the <b>drain.</b> Floodgate <b>opening</b> at this site also caused changes in groundwater hydraulic gradients, leading to incursion of saline drain water into shallow groundwater over 80 m from the drain. Lateral movement of solutes was relatively rapid, due to macropore flow in oxidised acid sulfate soil horizons, and caused substantial changes to shallow groundwater chemical composition. Conversely, when groundwater hydraulic gradients were towards the drain at this site there was substantial lateral outflow of acid groundwater into drains. This study {{highlights the importance of}} assessing the hydraulic properties of soils next to drains on coastal floodplains prior to opening floodgates, particularly in acid sulfate soil backswamps, in order to prevent unintended saline intrusion into shallow groundwater...|$|R

5000|$|The basic {{components}} of a mature mammary gland are the alveoli (hollow cavities, a few millimeters large) lined with milk-secreting cuboidal cells and surrounded by myoepithelial cells. These alveoli join to form groups known as lobules. Each lobule has a lactiferous duct that <b>drains</b> into <b>openings</b> in the nipple. The myoepithelial cells contract under the stimulation of oxytocin, excreting the milk secreted by alveolar units into the lobule lumen toward the nipple. As the infant begins to suck, the oxytocin-mediated [...] "let down reflex" [...] ensues and the mother's milk is secreted — not sucked from the gland — into the baby's mouth.|$|R
40|$|Raised {{intracranial}} {{pressure in the}} absence of ventricular dilatation is common in cryptococcal meningitis and associated with increased mortality. We report the case of a patient with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis, who developed increasing CSF pressure and visual impairment on therapy despite serial lumbar punctures. Insertion of a temporary lumbar <b>drain</b> controlled the <b>opening</b> pressure and resulted in full visual recovery. The advantages and necessary precautions with this approach are reviewed, and alternative protocols for the use of lumbar drains discussed...|$|R
40|$|Mediterranean lagoons {{rather than}} hydrochemical or sed-imentological ones (FRISONI et al., 1984). We studied the {{qualitative}} and quantitative composition of the macrobenthic fauna in Drana lagoon (Evros delta, N. Aegean Sea) during summer of 1981, 1997 and 1998. Since 1987 Drana lagoon has been isolated from the sea due to the obstruction of its narrow opening. MATERIAL AND METHODS The Evros Delta {{is located at the}} NE end of the Aegean Sea (Fig. 1). The Drana lagoon, one of the four lagoons of the delta (Fig. 1), is biologically significant since, among others, a large number of avifauna species inhabits the area. Fresh water occasionally enters the lagoon area mainly from the stream Mikri Maritsa and from drainage channels (Fig. 1). In the past the lagoon communicated with the sea through a narrow opening 4 m wide. In order for the Drana lagoon to be <b>drained,</b> its <b>opening</b> wa...|$|R
50|$|The oculus {{was used}} by the Romans, one of the finest {{examples}} being that in the dome of the Pantheon. Open to the weather, it allows rain to enter and fall to the floor, where it is carried away through <b>drains.</b> Though the <b>opening</b> looks small, it actually has a diameter of 27 ft allowing it to light the building just as the sun lights the earth. The rain also keeps the building cool during the hot summer months.Pliny in his Natural History call counters also oculus, oculi.|$|R
40|$|Most {{drainage}} theories {{ignore the}} effect of <b>drain</b> tube <b>openings</b> on water table drawdown. Kirkham and Schwab (1951) and Schwab and Kirkham (1951) developed methods for predicting {{the effect of}} circular <b>openings</b> in <b>drain</b> tubes on drainage rates for ponded surface conditions. Their results showed that drainage rates for standard drain tubes are typically 50 to 60 % of those for a completely open tube. The effects of the perforation area on drawdown and transient drainage rates are smaller than on drainage rates under ponded conditions (Skaggs, 1978). However, the effect may still be important. Some tubing companies advertise the advantages of large perforation areas. Agencies such as the US Soil Conservation Service (1977) and the Bureau of Reclamation (1978) require a minimum water entry area of 21 cm 2 /m. While there have been theoretical studies {{of the effect of}} perforations on transient state drainage (Skaggs and Tang, 1979), there are limited experimental studies of these effects. This paper reports the results of laboratory studies to determine the influence of drain tube perforations on water-table drawdown and drain flow...|$|R
50|$|Seacocks {{are left}} open or are closed {{depending}} on the situation. Seacocks feeding into or out of a closed system, like the engine cooling system, are almost always left open. Seacocks connected to something open, such as a sink drain, might be opened up in port but closed when at sea. The {{reason for this is}} that when the boat is level, the <b>drain</b> or other <b>opening</b> will always be above the waterline, and so water will only flow out. At sea, when the boat rolls in the waves, the opening may sometimes be below the waterline. If the seacock is open, water may flood the boat, causing it to sink.|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{components}} and devices {{are exposed to}} a wide variety of climatic conditions, therefore the protection of electronic devices from humidity is becoming a critical factor in the system design. The ingress of moisture into typical electronic enclosures has been studied with defined parameters such as openings in the enclosure (<b>drain</b> holes, intentional <b>openings</b> or leak) and sealing and casing material. Related corrosion reliability issues due to humidity buildup have been evaluated using an interdigitated surface insulation resistance pattern placed inside the enclosure during exposure. The moisture buildup inside the enclosure has been simulated using an equivalent RC circuit consisting of variables like controlled resistors and capacitors to describe the diffusivity, permeability, and storage in polymers...|$|R
5000|$|The bubbler pool {{could be}} <b>drained</b> by <b>opening</b> its sluice gates. However, the valves {{controlling}} it were underwater, {{located in a}} flooded corridor in the basement. So volunteers in wetsuits and respirators (for protection against radioactive aerosols) and equipped with dosimeters, entered the knee-deep radioactive water and managed to open the valves. These were the engineers Alexei Ananenko and Valeri Bezpalov (who knew where the valves were), accompanied by the shift supervisor Boris Baranov. [...] Upon succeeding and emerging from the water, according to many English language news articles, books and the prominent BBC docudrama Surviving Disaster - Chernobyl Nuclear, the three {{knew it was a}} suicide-mission and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after. Some sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant. However, research by Andrew Leatherbarrow, author of the 2016 book Chernobyl 01:23:40, determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration. Alexei Ananenko continues to work in the nuclear energy industry, and rebuffs the growth of the Chernobyl media sensationalism surrounding him. While Valeri Bezpalov was found to still be alive by Leatherbarrow, the elderly 65 year old Baranov had lived until 2005 and had died of heart failure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{roof of the}} {{building}} was flat and of poured concrete construction, and as such was the first known example {{of this type of}} roof in Cairns, and among the earliest in Queensland. It was waterproofed by a layer of bitumen and <b>drained</b> by five <b>openings</b> on the parapet on the north side, which connected to two down-pipes. This space was accessible to the public and was referred to as the [...] "plateau" [...] in Waters' design proposal, and as the [...] "roof garden" [...] by staff members. During World War I musicians used it as a stage for patriotic performances. Along the Spence and Lake Street sides the roof was protected by an ornamented parapet incorporating finials, arches, and balustrades of interlocked concrete circles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ground level}} in drained marshes {{subsides}} over time. All polders {{will eventually be}} below the surrounding water level {{some or all of}} the time. Water enters the low-lying polder through infiltration and water pressure of ground water, or rainfall, or transport of water by rivers and canals. This usually means that the polder has an excess of water, which is pumped out or <b>drained</b> by <b>opening</b> sluices at low tide. Care must be taken not to set the internal water level too low. Polder land made up of peat (former marshland) will sink in relation to its previous level, because of peat decomposing when exposed to oxygen from the air. [...] Polders are at risk from flooding at all times, and care must be taken to protect the surrounding dikes. Dikes are typically built with locally available materials, and each material has its own risks: sand is prone to collapse owing to saturation by water; dry peat is lighter than water and potentially unable to retain water in very dry seasons. Some animals dig tunnels in the barrier, allowing water to infiltrate the structure; the muskrat is known for this activity and hunted in certain European countries because of it. Polders are most commonly, though not exclusively, found in river deltas, former fenlands and coastal areas.|$|R
