40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the optimal error estimates and <b>energy</b> <b>conservation</b> properties of the alternating direction implicit finite-difference time-domain (ADI-FDTD) method which is a popular scheme for solving the 3 D Maxwell equations. Precisely, for the case with a perfectly electric conducting (PEC) boundary condition we establish the optimal second-order error estimates in both space and time in the discrete $H^ 1 $-norm for the ADI-FDTD scheme and prove the approximate divergence preserving property that if the divergence of the initial electric and magnetic fields are zero then the discrete $L^ 2 $-norm of the discrete divergence of the ADI-FDTD solution is approximately zero with the second-order accuracy in both space and time. A key ingredient is two new discrete energy norms which are second-order in time perturbations of two new <b>energy</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>laws</b> for the Maxwell equations introduced in this paper. Furthermore, we prove that, in addition to two known discrete energy identities which are second-order in time perturbations of two known <b>energy</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>laws,</b> the ADI-FDTD scheme also satisfies two new discrete energy identities which are second-order in time perturbations of the two new <b>energy</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>laws.</b> This means that the ADI-FDTD scheme is unconditionally stable under the four discrete energy norms. Experimental results are presented which confirm the theoretical results. Comment: 25 page...|$|R

2500|$|The {{conservation}} of energy is a common feature in many physical theories. From a mathematical point of view it is understood {{as a consequence of}} Noether's theorem, developed by Emmy Noether in 1915 and first published in 1918. The theorem states every continuous symmetry of a physical theory has an associated conserved quantity; if the theory's symmetry is time invariance then the conserved quantity is called [...] "energy". The <b>energy</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>law</b> is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time; energy conservation is implied by the empirical fact that the laws of physics do not change with time itself. Philosophically this can be stated as [...] "nothing depends on time per se".|$|E
