5|$|After rescuing {{the three}} girls, Ayres tried to jump herself, but {{overcome}} by smoke inhalation, fell limply from the window, striking the projecting shop sign. She missed {{the mattress and}} the crowd below and <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> pavement, suffering spinal injuries. Ayres was rushed to nearby Guy's Hospital where, because of the public interest that her story excited, hourly bulletins were issued about her health and Queen Victoria sent a lady-in-waiting to enquire after her condition.|$|E
5|$|In February 2000, {{a tree in}} the Adventureland section <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> DRR's Holiday Red {{freight train}} while it was in motion, {{damaging}} the awnings and their supports on the gondolas as well as knocking off the cupola {{on top of the}} caboose before the train came to a stop. No injuries occurred {{as a result of this}} accident.|$|E
5|$|At 02:45, Amethyst {{was able}} to pull across the bows of Niémen, inflicting a devastating raking fire on the French ship which caused terrible damage. Niémen surged forward into Amethyst, but the {{collision}} caused little damage and at 03:00 Amethyst again raked her opponent, this time from the east. The frigates were so close that shot from Amethyst started fires among Niémens hammock netting, placed along the decks to deter boarding actions. At 03:15, Niémens mizenmast and main topmast collapsed and another fire {{broke out in the}} main top, but Amethyst was also severely damaged and at 03:30 her mainmast <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> deck from a combination of shot damage and stress in high winds. Niémens mainmast also collapsed a few minutes later. Both frigates had stopped firing at 03:25, as the confusion on their decks was brought under control.|$|E
50|$|A {{prolonged}} peace {{followed for}} Britain, until {{the beginning of}} the Crimean War in 1854. After the Train's disbandment, logistical support <b>fell</b> solely <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Commissariat's shoulders.|$|R
5000|$|On February 28, 1973, Aeroflot Flight X-167, a Yak-40 (CCCP-87602), <b>fell</b> back <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> runway at Semipalatinsk Airport during takeoff due to crew error, {{killing all}} 32 on board.|$|R
50|$|On 22 December 1970, {{a launch}} of a target vehicle for ASAT tests lost thrust at liftoff and <b>fell</b> back <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> pad at Plesetsk, {{exploding}} and badly damaging it.|$|R
5|$|In Nuevo León, fifteen {{people were}} {{confirmed}} to have died: one bricklayer who died after a housing unit under construction collapsed {{on top of}} him; two men {{and a woman who}} died after their vehicle rolled over and crashed into a semi-trailer truck due to the intense rainfall; a 25-year-old who was swept away by swift currents and pinned against a fence; an elderly man who died after a wall toppled over him, a woman who died after a large boulder from a rock slide fell on her home, and a young man who <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Arroyo Topo Chico. Eight more bodies were found after floodwaters began receding, although one {{is believed to have been}} washed away from a cemetery. Twenty people in Nuevo León were reported missing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 16 June, Hess rushed his guards and {{attempted}} suicide by jumping over the railing of the staircase at Mytchett Place. He <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> stone floor below, fracturing the femur of his left leg. The injury required that the leg be kept in traction for 12 weeks, with a further six weeks bed rest before he was permitted to walk with crutches. Captain Munro Johnson of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who assessed Hess, noted that another suicide attempt was likely to occur in the near future. Hess began around this time to complain of amnesia. This symptom and some of his increasingly erratic behaviour may have in part been a ruse, because if he were declared mentally ill, he could be repatriated under the terms of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E
5|$|There were {{calls for}} {{platform}} screen doors {{to be installed}} at above-ground stations after several incidents in which passengers were killed by oncoming trains when they <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> railway tracks at above-ground stations. Underground stations already featured platform screen doors since 1987. The authorities initially rejected the proposal by casting doubts over functionality and concerns about the high installation costs, but made an about-turn when the government announced plans to install half-height platform screen doors on the above-ground stations in January 2008, citing lower costs due to it becoming a more common feature worldwide. They were first installed at Jurong East, Pasir Ris and Yishun stations in 2009 under trials to test their feasibility.|$|E
5000|$|After a {{passenger}} {{had left the}} train near the Hilliard street bridge at the North End, he walked off <b>the</b> trestle and <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> to <b>the</b> road beneath. When conductor rushed to help him, the man got up uninjured and just exclaimed: [...] "Where am I, anyway?" ...|$|R
50|$|LC-36A was {{the scene}} of the biggest on-pad {{explosion}} in Cape history when Atlas-Centaur AC-5 <b>fell</b> back <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> pad on March 2, 1965. The accident spurred NASA to complete work on LC-36B which had been abandoned when it was 90% finished.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of this funding change the cost of running <b>the</b> SCP's <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> local councils. <b>The</b> drive to save costs due to the {{recession}} led in 2010 and 2011 to many councils reviewing their spending in this area.|$|R
5|$|The first {{match that}} aired {{was for the}} WWE Intercontinental Championship in a Steel cage match, a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets of mesh metal around, in, or against {{the edges of the}} wrestling ring. Jeff Hardy was {{defending}} the title against Johnny Nitro. The match included various high-flying moves like top-rope kicks and powerbombs {{off the top of the}} cage. Near the end of the match, Hardy pulled Nitro from the top of the cage and nearly scored a pinfall after a Swanton Bomb, but Nitro put his foot on the bottom rope. Nitro then made it over the cage, but just as Nitro was about to jump, Hardy dropkicked the door open, and Nitro <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> top of the door, paining him between his legs. As Nitro was on top of the door, Hardy kicked the cage door, and walked out the door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{floating}} {{stage on}} which Jarre and his musicians performed {{was built on}} top of four large barges. Large purpose-built display screens were built, {{and one of the}} buildings {{to be used as a}} backdrop was painted white. One large mirror ball being transported to the event <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> roadside, causing a degree of confusion as some people mistook it for a fallen satellite. World War II searchlights were installed, to illuminate the sky and surrounding architecture. Along with thousands in the surrounding streets and parks, 200,000people watched Jarre and guests such as guitarist Hank Marvin perform in less than ideal conditions. Inclement weather had threatened to break the stage from its moorings, putting paid to the original plan to float the stage across the Royal Victoria Dock. Wind speeds were so high that television cameras were blown over. On the second evening the audience, which included Diana, Princess of Wales, was soaked by rain and wind.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{construction}} in 1874, the Whipple truss {{bridge over the}} South Branch Potomac River served Romney and travelers along the Northwestern Turnpike for 63 years. In 1935, the West Virginia State Road Commission began organizing a project to replace the Whipple truss bridge, and construction of the new bridge had begun by 1936. In November of that year, a car collided with {{the south side of}} the eastern Whipple truss span, which knocked the span completely off its eastern abutment. The car plunged into the South Branch Potomac River, followed by the compromised truss span, which collapsed on top of the car. Unaware of the span's collapse, a car traveling from the west drove off the end of the west span at the bridge's center pier, and <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> collapsed span. According to the Hampshire Review, the only serious injury sustained was a broken wooden leg. Following the collapse of the eastern Whipple truss span, a temporary wooden span was hastily constructed between the western truss span and the eastern abutment, so that traffic was uninterrupted until the new bridge was completed and opened on June 21, 1937. The 1937 bridge was used until 2010 when it was replaced by the current South Branch Bridge.|$|E
50|$|On January 13, 1968, 4 {{minutes into}} {{a game against the}} Minnesota North Stars at the Met Center, Bill Masterton was checked by Larry Cahan and Ron Harris, and <b>fell</b> {{backwards}} <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> ice. The force of {{the back of his head}} hitting the ice caused significant internal bleeding. Masterton lost consciousness and never regained it: he died two days later.|$|R
5000|$|The 1977 Granville train {{disaster}} in Sydney, Australia, which involved {{the collapse of}} a bridge after its support pylons were struck by a train. The concrete road overpass <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> carriages of <b>the</b> train, crushing them. 83 died and more than 210 were injured.|$|R
5000|$|The famous Oldenburg {{meteorite}} ('Bissel' fragment, 4.84 kg) is {{also kept}} in the museum's collection. The meteorite <b>fell</b> in 1930 <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> villages of Bissel (parish of Großenkneten) and Beverbruch (parish of Garrel).|$|R
5|$|On 6 April 1941, {{when the}} World War II German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia began, Morava was based at Stara Kanjiža on the Tisza river, as the flagship of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division. This force {{was responsible for}} the Hungarian border, and came under the operational control of the 7th Infantry Division Potiska. The remainder of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division consisted of the river tug R-XXI, the river transport Senta, and a few mobilised customs motorboats, based further south on the Tisza at Senta. On 7 April, Morava withdrew to Senta, where she was attacked by German aircraft. According to her commander, Poručnik bojnog broda Božidar Aranđelović, her crew shot down one German aircraft and captured a Luftwaffe Oberstleutnant. On 10 April, Morava was ordered to withdraw to conform with the retreat of the 2nd Army Group of the Royal Yugoslav Army from Bačka and Baranja. On the evening of 11 April, Morava anchored at the confluence of the Danube and Sava near Belgrade, along with her fellow monitors Vardar and Sava, and Aranđelović took command of the flotilla. The three captains conferred, and decided to scuttle their vessels due to the high water levels in the rivers and low bridges, which meant insufficient clearance for the monitors to navigate freely. The crews of the monitors were transshipped to two tugboats, but when one of the tugboats was passing under a railway bridge, demolition charges on the bridge exploded prematurely and the bridge <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> tugboat. Of the 110 officers and men aboard the vessel, 95 were killed.|$|E
5|$|The theatre burnt down on 17 June 1789 during evening rehearsals, and {{the dancers}} fled the {{building}} as beams <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> stage. The fire had been deliberately set on the roof, and Gallini offered a reward of £300 for capture of the culprit. With the theatre destroyed, each group laid their own plans for a replacement. Gallini obtained a licence from the Lord Chamberlain to perform opera at the nearby Little Theatre, and he entered into a partnership with R. B. O'Reilly to obtain land in Leicester Fields for a new building, which too would require a licence. The two quarrelled, and each then planned to wrest control of the venture from the other. The authorities refused to grant either of them a patent for Leicester Fields, but O'Reilly was granted a licence for four years to put on opera at the Oxford Street Pantheon. This too, would burn {{to the ground in}} 1792. Meanwhile, Taylor reached an agreement with the creditors of the King's Theatre and attempted to purchase the remainder of the lease from Edward Vanbrugh, but this was now promised to O'Reilly. A further complication arose as the theatre needed to expand onto adjacent land that now came into the possession of a Taylor supporter. The scene was set for a further war of attrition between the lessees, but at this point O'Reilly's first season at the Pantheon failed miserably, and he fled to Paris to avoid his creditors.|$|E
5|$|Another virtual safety car period ensued on lap 34, {{caused by}} Verstappen who crashed his {{car into the}} barrier after locking up his tyres. As the VSC ended on lap 37, Ricciardo once more failed {{in an attempt to}} regain the lead. At the chicane coming out of the tunnel, Hamilton misjudged the corner and backed Ricciardo off at the exit of the chicane, causing the latter to {{complain}} about the move on team radio. While the incident was investigated by the stewards, the decision was not to take action against Hamilton. At that point, the order stood as follows: Hamilton, Ricciardo, Pérez, Vettel, Alonso, Rosberg, Hülkenberg, Sainz, Button and Gutiérrez. The top four drivers pulled away cleanly {{from the rest of the}} field behind them. On lap 50, the two Sauber cars collided at Rascasse corner, after Felipe Nasr had ignored instructions from the pit lane to let his teammate Ericsson behind him pass. Another VSC period was called while both Sauber drivers made pit stops to repair damages, only for both to retire some laps later. In front, the race carried on in the same order. On lap 68, the fourth virtual safety car period occurred when a large plastic sheet <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> start–finish straight. Hamilton was able to extend his lead over Ricciardo at that point, setting the fastest lap of the race on lap 71. Three laps from the finish, rain started to fall again, although no driver changed tyres before the chequered flag fell. Hamilton crossed the finish line to take victory ahead of Ricciardo and Pérez. This win for Hamilton marked his second at Monaco, the other being in 2008. These two races featured many similarities, such as the Hamilton starting third on the grid, the race starting in wet conditions and finishing in the dry, as well as Hamilton taking the lead on lap 33. Vettel hung on to fourth, followed by Alonso in fifth. Rosberg however lost his sixth place to Nico Hülkenberg on the very last lap.|$|E
30|$|When {{the upper}} magnet was applied, the microdroplets were magnetized, fly upward {{and stick to}} the PS surface due to its strong hysteresis. On the other hand, when the {{magnetic}} force was reversed, <b>the</b> microdroplet <b>fell</b> down <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> initial surface. The principal key point of this application is that the reversible transport is made without any lost of liquid.|$|R
5000|$|This was {{the origin}} of the Blutfahne (blood-flag), which became stained with the blood of two SA members who were shot: the flagbearer Heinrich Trambauer, who was badly wounded, and Andreas Bauriedl, who <b>fell</b> dead <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> fallen flag. [...] A bullet killed Scheubner-Richter. [...] Göring was shot in the leg, but escaped. The rest of the Nazis {{scattered}} or were arrested. Hitler was arrested two days later.|$|R
50|$|Dickson {{died from}} the {{lingering}} effects of an accident. Near {{the end of his}} first session in Congress, Dickson stood up from the chair in which he was sitting in order to consult a book. He did not notice that the chair overturned, and when he attempted to resume his seat, Dickson <b>fell</b> heavily <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> floor. The concussion to his spine resulted in gradual paralysis, and within a few months he lost the use of his lower limbs.|$|R
5|$|Damage {{from the}} {{hurricane}} was comparatively less in New Brunswick than in Nova Scotia, {{but was still}} considerable. The rough seas impacted ships offshore the province, disrupting the lobster industry. Two groups of lobster fishermen went missing in the Northumberland Strait; they were later found. Thousands of lobster traps and several wharves were either damaged or destroyed in the strait. Hundreds of boats were set adrift or sunk in the strait as well. Several boats in Rothesay and Westfield were also lost. A man in Dixon Point lost CA$1,000of live lobsters due to the storm. A wharf in Shediac was washed away. Fifty boats were sunk off Cap-Pelé, while in Greville, four scows were destroyed. The rising seawater inundated a bridge crossing the Millstream River under 3ft (0.9m) of water. A bridge crossing the Little River and another bridge in Cocagne were also damaged. Dykes in the Baie Verte area were damaged, resulting in {{thousands of dollars in}} damages. Further inland, winds caused infrastructural and agricultural damage. Winds peaked at 85mph (135km/h) at Lakeburn Airport. The strong winds disrupted power and telecommunication services in Moncton. Streets were blocked by trees blown down by strong winds. Offshore, three yachts were destroyed. A tree <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Gagetown United Church {{as a result of the}} winds, causing considerable damage. Grain and apple crops were also destroyed in Gagetown. In Saint John, chimneys were toppled. Flying debris injured several people, and power outages also greatly affected the city. High waves in conjunction with strong gusts scattered boats in the nearby Saint John River. Tents in the Sussex Military Camp were destroyed. The hurricane's effects resulted in a car accident which injured eight people. Though no fatalities were confirmed in New Brunswick, a person went missing in Bathurst, who was later presumed dead.|$|E
25|$|On September 4, 2012, a 54-year-old man <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> tracks at the North Hollywood {{station and}} {{was hit by}} an {{oncoming}} train. He was rescued by firefighters and paramedics, but died at the hospital.|$|E
25|$|On July 7, 2014, 22 {{guests were}} {{stranded}} {{for over two}} hours after a tree branch <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> coaster track. Four of the 22 guests were injured, but none serious enough to require a hospital visit.|$|E
50|$|A major {{earthquake}} {{took place}} in Taiwan during 31 March 2002 destroying a construction crane at the rooftop, which was at floor number 47. <b>The</b> crane <b>fell</b> down <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Xinyi Road beneath the tower, crushing several vehicles and causing five deaths - two crane operators and three workers who were not properly harnessed. However, an inspection showed no structural damage to the building, and construction work was able to restart within a week.|$|R
50|$|In 1378, fire {{destroyed}} {{the roofs of}} the four towers, which were repaired with help from saved financial resources. A strong storm in 1434 provided later troubles. Three of the four gables of the towers were thrown down. One of the gables struck a nearby fish market, two others <b>fell</b> directly <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> vault over the main altar. The vault was later repaired, and a commemorative bell dated with the year 1436 was hung.|$|R
50|$|Nova {{encountered}} Blackout {{on his way}} {{to exact}} revenge, and Blackout easily defeated the young hero. Before Nova could catch up with him, Blackout returned to the labs, killing Croit and his new assistant by letting them “merge with the color spectrum” (actually, by shunting them to the Darkforce dimension). Following another skirmish with Nova, Blackout himself vanished into this dimension when he <b>fell</b> back <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> stabilizer during the battle, destroying it.|$|R
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1994 the bridge deck {{launching}} gantry <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Gwent viaduct, causing the 200tonne bridge deck unit to fall onto the deck below. Although this delayed the project by ten weeks, the builders still completed the bridge on schedule two years later.|$|E
25|$|After {{a minute}} or so, a dark plume of smoke was {{observed}} rising from the wreckage. The fire was traced to a ruptured oil tank above the right engine. The leaking oil <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> hot engine and ignited. The fire was not fed by jet fuel.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} a {{prominent}} feature of the village, but is inconspicuous from the Market Place. In 2006 it was damaged when gale force winds blew down {{two of the four}} pinnacles, one of which <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> roof causing damaging costing more than £100,000 to repair. Folkingham parish is part of the South Lafford Group of parishes in the Lafford Deanery, Diocese of Lincoln.|$|E
5000|$|In 1139 {{a strong}} {{earthquake}} happened in Ganja and practically destroyed the city. The earthquake {{was so strong}} that top part of Mount Kapaz to the south-west of the town was broken and <b>fell</b> down <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Aghsu River and created Lake Göygöl and other small lakes. King Demetrius I of Georgia took the advantage of the earthquake to attack and loot the defenseless Ganja. He captured the gates as his trophy.|$|R
50|$|It was now 9.39pm and {{numerous}} police units were {{rushing to the}} scene. Knight dropped the empty Mossberg shotgun {{on the ground and}} took up a prone firing position with his M14 rifle. At this point Vesna Markovska broke cover from behind her car and made for the footpath on the eastern side of Hoddle Street. As she stepped <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> footpath she was spotted by Knight who fired a shot which seriously wounded her. When she <b>fell</b> back <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> roadway Knight fired two further shots which killed her.|$|R
50|$|The statue {{stood for}} 54 years until Rhodes {{was hit by}} the 226 BC earthquake, when {{significant}} damage was also done to large portions of the city, including the harbour and commercial buildings, which were destroyed. The statue snapped at the knees and <b>fell</b> over <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> land. Ptolemy III offered {{to pay for the}} reconstruction of the statue, but the oracle of Delphi made the Rhodians afraid that they had offended Helios, and they declined to rebuild it.|$|R
