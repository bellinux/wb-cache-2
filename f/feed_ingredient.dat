2500|$|In 1999, the Dioxin Affair {{occurred}} when 50kg of PCB transformer oils {{were added to}} a stock of recycled fat used {{for the production of}} 500 tonnes of animal feed, eventually affecting around 2,500 farms in several countries. The name Dioxin Affair was coined from early misdiagnosis of dioxins as the primary contaminants, when in fact {{they turned out to be}} a relatively small part of the contamination caused by thermal reactions of PCBs. The PCB congener pattern suggested the contamination was from a mixture of Aroclor 1260 & 1254. Over 9 million chickens, and 60,000 pigs were destroyed because of the contamination. [...] The extent of human health effects has been debated, in part because of the use of differing risk assessment methods. [...] One group predicted increased cancer rates, and increased rates of neurological problems in those exposed as neonates. A second study suggested carcinogenic effects were unlikely and that the primary risk would be associated with developmental effects due to exposure in pregnancy and neonates. Two businessmen who knowingly sold the contaminated <b>feed</b> <b>ingredient</b> received two-year suspended sentences for their role in the crisis.|$|E

40|$|Nine {{individual}} <b>feed</b> <b>ingredients</b> and 12 mixed diets {{were used}} {{in an attempt to}} select the most suitable regression equation for predicting energy value and nitrogen digestibility from chemical analyses. Samples were analyzed for crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), crude fiber (CF), ash, moisture and nitrogen-free extract (NFE). <b>Feed</b> <b>ingredients</b> were corn, sorghum grain, wheat (trial 1), alfalfa meal, wheat bran, rice bran (trial 2), soybean meal, meat and bone meal and sunflower meal (trial 3). Levels ranged from 9. 9 to 53. 9 % for CP, from 1. 5 to 25. 5 % for CF, and from 1. 7 to 27. 3 % for ash. A total of 72 pigs with average initial weight of 25 kg (55 lb) {{were used in}} three conventional digestion trials to measure the dry matter digestibility (DMD), nitrogen digestibility (ND), digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) of diets and <b>feed</b> <b>ingredients.</b> <b>Feed</b> <b>ingredients</b> were substituted for the basal diets at 50, 30 and 20 % in trial 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The DMD, ND, DE and ME were measured by difference between determined values for the test ingredient and the basal diet. Fiber was the major factor depressing DMD, ND, DE and ME in both diets and <b>feed</b> <b>ingredients.</b> Levels of crude fiber and protein affected the ratio of ME to DE in <b>feed</b> <b>ingredients</b> as in the following equation: ME/DE, % = 100. 4 -. 12 CP -. 15 CF (r =. 94, P<. 01). High correlations were found between ME and DE and DMD in diets and <b>feed</b> <b>ingredients.</b> The DE and ME in <b>feed</b> <b>ingredients</b> could be predicated from only CF and ash by the following equations: DE, kcal/ g DM = 4. 360 -. 0652 CF -. 0489 ash (r =. 93, P<. 0 l); and ME, kcal/g DM = 4. 277 -. 0676 CF -. 0516 ash (r =. 95, P<. 00 l). These results suggest that nitrogen digestibility and digestible energy of <b>feed</b> <b>ingredients</b> and complete diets for swine can be estimated from chemical analyses...|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} in the world population, high cost of conventional animal <b>feed</b> <b>ingredients</b> and low protein intake in most developing countries has necessitated animal scientists to search for alternative sources of <b>feed</b> <b>ingredients.</b> This can enhance the production of animals with short generation intervals such as poultry to overcome the protein deficiency. This paper reviews cereal grains and cereal by-products as alternative <b>feed</b> <b>ingredients</b> for formulating poultry diets. Results obtained from various sources indicate that diets formulated with alternative cereal grains and cereal by-products had no adverse effects on body weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion ratio and carcass quality of broiler chickens, cockerels and egg quality of laying hens. Inclusion of different levels of brewers’ dried grain, maize offal, rice bran and broken rice are quite acceptable in poultry diets. Therefore, sorghum, millet, maize offal, rice bran and wheat offal, millet bran, spent sorghum grain and broken rice could be recommended as alternative sources of <b>feed</b> <b>ingredients</b> in poultry diets...|$|R

50|$|Distillers dried grains with {{solubles}} (DDGS), {{which are}} rich in energy and protein, {{have been used in}} place of corn and soybean meal in some livestock and poultry feeds, and corn DDGS have become the most popular, economical, and widely available alternative <b>feed</b> <b>ingredient</b> for use in U.S. swine diets in all phases of production. The U.S. Grain Council reported that corn DDGS is used primarily as an energy source in swine diets because it contains approximately the same amount of digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) as corn, although the ME content may be slightly reduced when feeding reduced-oil DDGS. A 2007 study highlighted the recent trends in the use of DDGS, as many producers are including 20% DDGS in diets of swine in all categories. Although 20% is the recommended level of inclusion, some producers are successfully using greater inclusion rates. Inclusion rate of up to 35% DDGS has been used in diets fed to nursery pigs and finishing pigs.|$|E
