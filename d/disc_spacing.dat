Prior to a planting operation, a secondary disc harrow with narrow <b>disc</b> <b>spacing</b> of 8", 9", and even 10" [...] with disc sizes ranging from 20", 22", 24", to 26" [...] can be used. Other similar secondary tillage tine implements or rotary harrows are also widely used. When choosing secondary tillage equipment, soil type as well as soil moisture content at the time must be considered. Lighter secondary disc harrows are primarily used to break down soil clods into smaller pieces. By so doing, water penetrates more easily into the soil, soil aeration is increased, and the activity of soil biota is enhanced; the final result is a seed bed that is suitable for planting.|$|E

The property of dielectric material is addressed, and field modes in a cylindrical resonator are discussed. It is identified that the fundamental mode of HE 11 δ generates the far field with a higher directivity than other modes. More effective field enhancement in the radiation direction could be achieved by using multiple-disc antenna arrays. Simulation examples indicate that the directivity of a disc antenna array varies with the <b>disc</b> <b>spacing.</b> The maximum directivity is observed when the <b>disc</b> <b>spacing</b> is approximately equal to the half of the vacuum wavelength. The maximum directivity can be improved significantly when the disc number is increased. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|An {{internal}} failure mode for a soil-nailed system consists of failure at nail heads, slope facing, nail strength, along grout–soil interface and pullout failure. A {{better understanding of}} pullout of soil nail thus becomes important to assess the stability of a soil-nailed system. In the present study, {{an investigation into the}} pullout behaviour of soil nail with circular discs along the shaft has been carried out by a three-dimensional finite element analysis using Abaqus/Explicit routine. A total of 67 simulations have been performed to accurately predict the pullout behaviour of soil nail. The soil nail under study has circular discs along its shaft varying in numbers from 1 to 4. The pullout of this soil nail in a pullout test box has been simulated with a constant overburden pressure of 20  kPa acting on the nail. The pullout load–displacement characteristics, stresses around soil nail and failure mechanism during pullout are studied. Variations of dimensionless factors such as normalised pullout load factor and bearing capacity factor have been obtained with different combinations of parameters in terms of relative <b>disc</b> <b>spacing</b> ratio, anchorage length ratio, embedment ratio, diameter ratio and displacement ratio. From the results of analyses, it is found that nail with more circular discs requires higher pullout load.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to quantify the {{relationship of}} the esophagus to the CVB, <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> and LC. 30 patients were selected for a retrospective review of computed tomography (CT) scans. Measurements between the esophagus and the C 5, C 6, and C 7 vertebral bodies as well as the C 5 / 6 and C 6 / 7 <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> were performed in the midline, 3  mm right and left of midline, and at the edge of the LC on both sides. The closest distance of the esophagus to the CVB and <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> occurs at the midline (range 1. 02 – 1. 31  mm at each level). The furthest distance occurred at the edge of the right LC (range 2. 67 – 3. 30  mm at each level).

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of rock fragmentation underneath disc cutters {{is not fully}} understood although a number of experimental and numerical investigations {{have been carried out}} in this field. Linear elastic fracture mechanics is widely applied for the analysis of crack problems in rock mechanics. In this study, the higher order displacement discontinuity method is modified for the analysis of crack problems using the cubic variations of displacement discontinuities and three special crack tip elements. It is shown how a new formulation of the indirect boundary element method known as the displacement discontinuity method (DDM) can be used to determine the stress intensity factors of the cracks produced in rocks underneath disc cutters of tunnel boring machines (TBMs). Crack initiation angles and propagation paths in the rock can also be predicted using this numerical procedure and a mixed mode fracture criterion (for example, the maximum tensile stress criterion). In this numerical approach, three special crack tip elements are used to increase the accuracy of the displacement discontinuities near the crack tips. This method has been used to find approximately the effect of the specific disc parameters (except speed) on the thrust force, the rolling force, and the specific energy. Crack propagation in rocks under disc cutters is numerically modeled and an optimum ratio of <b>disc</b> <b>spacing</b> to penetration depth of about 10 is obtained, in good agreement with the theoretical and experimental results in the literature. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to quantify the}} changes in disc cutter performance between dry and saturated rock. The tests were conducted using samples of limestone and sandstone to determine whether changes in performance are consistent across rock types. A linear rock cutting machine was used to conduct the tests with a rolling disc cutter. The tests were performed at varying depths with fixed <b>disc</b> <b>spacing.</b> Cutting forces were measured in the different rocks and cutting depths with rock yield determined and specific energy calculated. Comparing the results between cutting in dry and saturated rock showed reductions in cutting forces of 52 % and 7 % respectively for sandstone and limestone.

The changes in specific energy were similar with a 43 % and 9 % reduction in sandstone and limestone. This difference in behaviour between the two rocks was also reflected in rock strength. A comparison of the strength between dry and saturated rock found the change was non-uniform with a 64 % and 17 % reduction in uniaxial compressive strength in the saturated sandstone and limestone samples respectively. When using a rolling disc cutter, rock cutting performance and rock strength were found to alter between dry and saturated conditions. In the case of a sandstone sample there were significant reductions in cutting forces, specific energy and strength whereas in limestone there were only marginal reductions in these parameters...|$|E
40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional {{analysis}} of long-term follow-up (LTFU) data from 4 randomized controlled trials of operative versus nonoperative treatment for chronic low back pain. OBJECTIVE: To examine {{the influence of}} spinal fusion on adjacent segment <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height {{as an indicator of}} disc degeneration at LTFU. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is ongoing debate as to whether adjacent segment disc degeneration results from the increased mechanical stress of fusion. METHODS: Plain standing lateral radiographs were obtained at LTFU (mean, 13 ± 4 yr postrandomization) in 229 of 464 (49 %) patients randomized to surgery and 140 of 303 (46 %), to nonoperative care. <b>Disc</b> <b>space</b> height and posteroanterior displacement were measured for each lumbar segment using a validated computer-assisted distortion compensated roentgen analysis technique. Values were reported in units of standard deviations above or below age and sex-adjusted normal values. Patient-rated outcomes included the Oswestry Disability Index and pain scales. RESULTS: Radiographs were usable in 355 of 369 (96 %) patients (259 fusion and 96 nonoperative treatment). Both treatment groups showed significantly lower values for <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height of the adjacent segment than norm values. There was a significant difference between treatment groups for the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height of the cranial adjacent segment (in both as-treated and intention-to-treat analyses). The mean treatment effect of fusion on adjacent segment <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height was - 0. 44 SDs (95 % CI, - 0. 77 to - 0. 11; P = 0. 01; as-treated analysis); there was no group difference for posteroanterior displacement (0. 18 SDs, 95 % confidence interval, - 0. 28 to 0. 64, P = 0. 45). Adjacent level <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height and posteroanterior displacement were not correlated with Oswestry Disability Index or pain scores at LTFU (r = 0. 010 - 0. 05; P > 0. 33).

40|$|Spondylosis deformans and diffuse {{idiopathic}} skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) {{are usually}} incidental ﬁndings {{and in most}} dogs are either asymptomatic or associated with mild clinical signs. Severe spondylosis defor- mans and DISH can result in complete bony fusion of consecutive vertebral segments. One of the recognised complications following vertebral fusion in human patients is the development of adjacent segment disease, which is deﬁned as degenerative changes, most commonly degenerative intervertebral disc disease, in the mobile vertebral segment neighboring a region of complete vertebral fusion. A similar syndrome following cervical fusion in dogs has been termed the domino effect. The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the hypothesis that vertebral fusion occurring secondary to spondylosis deformans or DISH in dogs would protect fused intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> from undergoing degeneration, but result in adjacent segment disease at neighbouring unfused intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces.</b> Eight dogs with clinical signs of thora- columbar myelopathy, magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracolumbar vertebral column, and spondylosis deformans or DISH producing fusion of ≥ 2 consecutive intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> were evaluated.

40|$|ABSTRACT Surgical {{treatment}} of intervertebral disc degeneration aims {{to restore the}} height of the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> and the release of involved neurological structures. Like any surgical treatment in orthopedics, {{the success or failure of}} the lumbar procedure involves the possibility of performing an adequate planning of each particular event. In the case of lumbar stabilization surgery with interbody fusion, it is essential to know the ideal height of the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> for the fusion to be successful. Objective: To demonstrate that the ideal height of the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> corresponds approximately to one third of {{the height of the}} vertebral body. Methods: X-ray images were taken in AP and lateral views of hospital residents to measure L 4 -L 5 vertebral bodies as well as the <b>disc</b> <b>space.</b> The rule of three was used to check the height of the disc and vertebral bodies. Results: It was verified that the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> corresponds to 31 % of the size of the vertebral body, taking 0. 31 as the constant. Conclusions: The size of the disc corresponds to one third of the vertebral body, taking 0. 31 as the constant. The multiplication of the constant by the height of the vertebral body results in the exact height of the disc. Thus, in the presence of degeneration of the intervertebral disc, it is possible to know the size of the disc and, therefore, the size of the interbody cage...|$|R

A blind randomized crossover-design {{study was conducted}} to quantitatively compare the intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> between axial and anterior lean cervical traction in sitting position. A total of 96 radiographic images from the baseline measurements, axial and anterior lean tractions in 32 asymptomatic subjects were digitized for further analysis. The intra- and inter-examiner reliabilities for measuring the intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> were in good ranges (ICCs = 0. 928 - 0. 942). With the application of anterior lean traction, the statistical increases were detected both in anterior and in posterior <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> compared to the baseline (0. 29 mm and 0. 24 mm; both P < 0. 01) and axial traction (0. 16 mm and 0. 35 mm; both P < 0. 01). The greater intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> obtained during anterior lean traction might be associated with the more even distribution of traction forces over the anterior and posterior neck structures.

30|$|Historically, {{debridement}} {{and drainage}} of disc abscess has been performed through open surgery and anterior {{exposure of the}} spine.

To assess the severity and {{reasons for the}} reduction of <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> distraction after successful autograft fusion of the lumbar spine and its clinical consequences. Summary of Background Data. Anterior lumbar interbody fusion is an established treatment for lumbar disc degeneration. It Is not firmly established whether the grafted level narrows after surgery, and if so, what the clinical consequences are. Methods. This study assessed 67 patients who underwent anterior lumbar interbody fusion at L 4 -L 5 with autologous iliac crest graft. The <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height and angle between L 4 and L 5 were serially measured. Times until fusion {{and the presence of}} symptoms before and after surgery and at the latest follow-up assessment were noted. Results. The mean follow-up period was 14 years (range, 2. 5 - 32 years). The fusion rate was 96 % (64 of 67 patients), and the mean time to fusion was 9 months. In the group that had successful fusion, there was an initial increase in <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> distraction followed by a reduction in 55 patients (86 %). The mean preoperative <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height was 12. 1 mm, which increased immediately after surgery to 16. 2 mm, but had been reduced to 12. 6 mm at the latest follow-up assessment. The reduction in distraction occurred within the first 3 months after surgery and was correlated with age, but not with recurrence of symptoms, the amount of initial distraction, or the gender of the individual. A similar trend was seen with L 4 -L 5 segmental angulation. Conclusions. Reduction of <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> distraction after anterior lumbar interbody fusion using tricortical iliac crest bone graft is a common finding.
