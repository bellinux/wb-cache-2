5|$|Wighard (or Wigheard; died between 664 and 667) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop-elect of Canterbury. What {{little is known}} about him comes from 8th-century writer Bede, but {{inconsistencies}} between various works have led to confusion about the exact circumstances of Wighard's election and whether he was ever confirmed in that office. What <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he died in Rome after travelling there for confirmation by the papacy of his elevation to the archbishopric. His death allowed Pope Vitalian to select the next archbishop from amongst the clergy in Rome.|$|E
25|$|What <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Miguel was the queen's {{favourite}} child. After {{the death}} of her firstborn, it was Miguel who received most of her attention, rather than Pedro, who was closer to his father.|$|E
25|$|Fred and John Lillywhite, as well {{as their}} elder brother, James (b. 1825), all went into {{business}} as sports outfitters. Perhaps because of this multiplicity of Lillywhites, latter day accounts of their non-cricketing activities sometimes conflict as to who did what. What <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Fred was a manager, probably from 1848 to 1855, in the firm of Lillywhite Brothers, a tobacconist and sports outfitter in Islington, then on the outskirts of London.|$|E
3000|$|It <b>is</b> not <b>clear</b> if the {{pressure}} condition (3.32) {{is needed to}} obtain a resonance strip—see Theorem  11 below.

The upper bound (3.34) is optimal for Im z = 0 [...] thanks to a general result of Bony–Burq–Ramond [27], [80, § 7.1].|$|R

50|$|What <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> now <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the West's {{fascination with}} the {{primitive}} {{has to do with}} its own crises in identity, with its own need to clearly demarcate subject and object even while flirting with other ways of experiencing the universe.|$|R
25|$|The Aboriginal {{history from}} this area is not {{especially}} well recorded. There was a mountain clan, the Ja-itma-thang, centred on the Omeo area, but this clan would have interacted regularly with nearby tribes, including the Gunai or Kurnai of Gippsland proper. Population levels are uncertain, but were likely highly underestimated by European settlers, especially with consideration given {{to the fact that}} observation in the mountains and forests of Gippsland is far more difficult than in the more open parts of Australia. What <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> like elsewhere, population levels quickly declined following European occupation due to both disease and conflict, and people from this clan are no longer found in the area.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why they built the Ogmore Valley as a {{standard}} gauge railway in a broad gauge area, forcing the decision to build a dock at considerable expense. It may have been unavoidable owing to the Gauge Act of 1846. If so then perhaps {{it would have been}} cheaper to build the line as dual gauge from the start instead of building a dock. Perhaps even this was not permissible. The Llynvi Valley Railway was formed in 1861 by reopening pre-1846 lines. This is probably why it was permitted to use broad gauge. What <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Brogdens sold off the Ulverston and Lancaster {{at about the same time}} as they started the Ogmore Valley Railway.|$|E
25|$|What <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Harappan {{society was}} not entirely peaceful, with the human {{skeletal}} remains demonstrating {{some of the highest}} rates of injury (15.5%) found in South Asian prehistory. Paleopathological analysis demonstrated that leprosy and tuberculosis were present at Harappa, with the highest prevalence of both disease and trauma present in the skeletons from Area G (an ossuary located south-east of the city walls). Furthermore, rates of cranio-facial trauma and infection increased through time demonstrating that the civilization collapsed amid illness and injury. The bioarchaeologists who examined the remains have suggested that the combined evidence for differences in mortuary treatment and epidemiology indicate that some individuals and communities at Harappa were excluded from access to basic resources like health and safety, a basic feature of hierarchical societies world-wide.|$|E

Olajide Laleye, {{told the}} News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) by {{telephone}} {{that the investigation}} would establish what happened. “However, what <b>is</b> already <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Nigerian Army troops did not initiate firing and only acted in self-defence after being fired upon,” Laleye said.|$|R

5|$|Before Sky made a formalised bid, Murdoch asked Chisholm {{to speak}} to Dyke about making a joint offer. The events of <b>that</b> meeting <b>are</b> vague, but what <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Chisholm came to the {{decision}} of not working with ITV. He instead chose to pursue an alliance with the BBC, aware of the cultural importance of Match of the Day. In February 1992, Quinton met Murdoch over lunch to go over his expectations, {{with the idea of}} a Premier League dedicated channel high on his priority. ITV had in the same month revealed plans to offer the league £80m over four years in exchange for exclusive rights. Dyke believed their deal would fend off BSkyB, but the BBC's quiet stance weakened ITV's position.|$|R
25|$|In 1160, Malcolm {{returned}} to Scotland having spent months campaigning {{in the service}} of the English on the Continent. After successfully dealing with a considerable number of disaffected magnates at Perth, the Chronicle of Holyrood and the twelfththirteenth-century Chronicle of Melrose reveal that he launched three military expeditions into Galloway. The circumstances surrounding these invasions is unclear, although what <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Fergus submitted to the Scots before the end of the year. Specifically, according to Gesta Annalia I, once the Scots subdued the Gallovidians, the conquerors forced Fergus to retire to the abbey of Holyrood, and hand over his son, Uhtred, as a royal hostage. The Chronicle of Holyrood and the fifteenth-century Ordinale of Holyrood corroborate Fergus' monastic retirement, with the former source further recording Fergus' grant of the lands of Dunrod to the abbey.|$|E
25|$|In later {{books of}} the Old Testament, Aaron and his kin are not {{mentioned}} very often except in literature dating to the Babylonian Exile and later. The books of Judges, Samuel and Kings mention priests and Levites, but do not mention the Aaronides in particular. The book of Ezekiel, which devotes much attention to priestly matters, calls the priestly upper class the Zadokites after one of King David's priests. It does reflect a two-tier priesthood with the Levites in subordinate position. A two-tier hierarchy of Aaronides and Levites appears in Ezra, Nehemiah and Chronicles. As a result, many historians think that Aaronide families did not control the priesthood in pre-exilic Israel. What <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> high priests claiming Aaronide descent dominated the Second Temple period. Most scholars think the Pentateuch reached its final form early in this period, which may account for Aaron's prominence in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers.|$|E
25|$|The {{fall of the}} Mauryas {{left the}} Khyber Pass unguarded, and a wave of foreign {{invasion}} followed. The Greco-Bactrian king, Demetrius, capitalized on the break-up, and he conquered southern Afghanistan and parts of northwestern India around 180BCE, forming the Indo-Greek Kingdom. The Indo-Greeks would maintain holdings on the trans-Indus region, and make forays into central India, for about a century. Under them, Buddhism flourished, and one of their kings, Menander, became a famous figure of Buddhism; he was {{to establish a new}} capital of Sagala, the modern city of Sialkot. However, the extent of their domains and the lengths of their rule are subject to much debate. Numismatic evidence indicates that they retained holdings in the subcontinent right up to the birth of Christ. Although the extent of their successes against indigenous powers such as the Shungas, Satavahanas, and Kalingas are unclear, what <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Scythian tribes, renamed Indo-Scythians, brought about the demise of the Indo-Greeks from around 70BCE and retained lands in the trans-Indus, the region of Mathura, and Gujarat.|$|E
30|$|The {{causes of}} the socio-political invisibility of urban water issues cannot be {{explained}} from one perspective alone. What <b>is</b> <b>clear,</b> however, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> an unprecedented {{effort on the part}} of all engaged stakeholders to abandon traditional approaches in favour of more courageous and open strategies is a necessity.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{studies have}} {{indicated}} <b>that</b> DDE <b>is</b> an endocrine disruptor and contributes to breast cancer, but more recent studies provide strong evidence <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> no relationship between DDE exposure and breast cancer.

25|$|The {{presence}} {{of large numbers}} of bodies grouped together suggests the resistance was more protracted than originally thought, and a number of desperate last stands were made. Evidence shows that many of the bodies, today marked by cairns, were found in several large groups around the camp – including one stand of around 150 men. A Zulu account describes a group of the 24th forming a square on the neck of Isandlwana. Colonial cavalry, the NMP and the carabiniers, who could easily have fled as they had horses, died around Durnford in his last stand, while nearby their horses were found dead on their picket rope. What <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the slaughter was complete in the area around the camp and back to Natal along the Fugitive's Drift. The fighting had been hand-to-hand combat and no quarter was given to the British regulars. The Zulus had been commanded to ignore the civilians in black coats and this meant that some officers, whose patrol dress was dark blue and black at the time, were spared and escaped.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{performed}} the song on Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular, her second Thanksgiving television special which aired on ABC on November 28, 2013. She had invited singer Elton John as special guest star for the performance. After {{a performance of}} John's 1974 single [...] "Bennie and the Jets", the duo started singing [...] "Artpop". They were seated opposite {{to each other on}} piano, and Gaga was ornamented in a dress made of Coca-Cola cans. During the chorus, they were joined by The Muppets who aided with background vocals. Chris Willman from Billboard called John as the best guest performer of the special. Maricela Gonzales from Entertainment Weekly was impressed with the performance, saying that although she did not understand the message behind the song, [...] "hat <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Gaga and Elton John belong together.

500|$|Abercrombie's next {{error was}} an {{apparent}} over-reliance on {{the analysis of}} Matthew Clerk. His lack of experienced engineers caused the state of French defences to be repeatedly misread. What <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Abercrombie, in his stated desire for haste, {{did not want to}} act on Clerk's recommendation to fortify Rattlesnake Hill, and then sought to blame Clerk, claiming he was merely acting on the engineer's advice. Clerk was one of the battle's casualties, so he was unavailable to defend himself against assignment of some of the blame. Captain Charles Lee of the 44th Foot wrote, on the prospect of using cannon on Rattlesnake Hill, [...] "There was one hill in particular, which seem'd to offer itself as an ally to us, it immediately commanded the lines from hence two small cannon well planted must have drove the French {{in a very short time}} from their breast work [...] this was never thought of, which (one wou'd imagine) must have occur'd to any blockhead who was not absolutely so far sunk into Idiotism as to be oblig'd to wear a bib and bells." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{larger problem}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> by 1979, {{combined}} ZIRPA and ZANLA strength inside Rhodesia totalled at least 12,500 guerrillas and it <b>was</b> evident <b>that</b> insurgents <b>were</b> {{entering the country}} {{at a faster rate}} than the Rhodesian forces could kill or capture. In addition, 22,000 ZIPRA and 16,000 ZANLA fighters remained uncommitted outside the country. Joshua Nkomo's ZIPRA forces were preparing their forces in Zambia with the intent of confronting the Rhodesians through a conventional invasion. Whether such an invasion could have been successful in the short term against the well trained Rhodesian army and air force is questionable. However, what <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the insurgency <b>was</b> growing in strength daily and the ability of the security forces to continue to control the entire country was coming under serious challenge.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{decades of}} resuscitating {{patients}} with intravenous fluids {{in intensive care}} units, it <b>is</b> somewhat surprising <b>that</b> very little consensus exists regarding the type of fluid physicians should choose. Factors <b>that</b> influence decisions <b>are</b> often local culture or politics, hospital administrators, history (i. e. ‘I’ve always done it this way’) and budgets, as opposed to strong evidence. In the present issue of Critical Care we are presented with compelling arguments for and against the administration of colloids (as opposed to crystalloids) in paediatric sepsis. One point <b>that</b> appears to <b>be</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the ideal choice of intravenous fluid goes beyond the simple haemodynamic effect. As such, in the future, clinicians will need to consider other factors when making their decision. In addition, large-scale quality randomised studies are desperately needed to guide clinicians...|$|R

500|$|Walter was reputed for his bravery, {{bordering}} on recklessness, and was confident of success, {{as evidenced by}} his haughty reply to the 500 mercenaries. Walter's pride and arrogance, combined with his numerical advantage and his innate belief in the superiority of heavy noble cavalry over infantry, led him to fatally underestimate his opponent and order a charge across even such an adverse terrain. Impatient for action, according to Muntaner Walter formed a cavalry line of 200 Frankish knights [...] "with golden spurs", followed by the infantry, and placed himself with his banner in the vanguard. The Frankish attack failed, but the reason is unclear; Muntaner's description is short and provides no details, while Gregoras states that the heavy Frankish cavalry got completely stuck in the mud, with the Almogavars, lightly armed with swords and darts, dispatching the knights, encumbered by their heavy armour. This is the commonly accepted version among scholars as well. The Chronicle of the Morea {{on the other hand}} implies that the battle was hard-fought, which as military historian Kelly DeVries notes seems to contradict Gregoras, and that the marsh possibly simply reduced the impact of the charge instead of bogging it down entirely. What <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Catalans held, and that the Duke and most of his men fell. As the two lines clashed, the Turkish auxiliaries, reassured {{that this was not a}} ruse, descended from their camp upon the Athenian army, panicking and routing what remained of it.|$|E

50|$|What <b>is</b> {{apparently}} <b>clear,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{regardless of}} names assigned by scientists and scholars, the broad ancient Mexico region or Cem Anahuac, had many cultures and subcultures scattered {{in time and}} space, it <b>is</b> very likely <b>that</b> all had a common origin, the Nahuatl language and its derivations, and the many found similar archaeological evidence could corroborate this, regardless of the assigned name.|$|R
50|$|According to Google Trends, {{the search}} terms related to {{scrapbook}} and scrapbooking {{have seen a}} 70 percent decline since its peak in 2005-2006. However, there is much debate among the community of people who engage in memory keeping about what the decline means for the health and future of the industry as a whole. What seems to <b>be</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> traditional scrapbooking <b>is</b> once again in a transition period due to many forces including current economic issues, the influence of social media and the ease of digital sharing, and {{the rejection of the}} stereotype of traditional scrapbooks being something <b>that</b> <b>is</b> for older women. However, if one takes a closer look, {{it is easy to see}} all the ways people continue memory keeping even if it doesn't fall strictly within the definition of traditional scrapbooking as defined here.|$|R

2500|$|The Armenian {{translations}} of Eusebius and Syncellus' transmissions (Chronicon and Ecloga Chronographica, respectively) both record Berossus' use of [...] "public records" [...] {{and it is}} possible that Berossus catalogued his sources. [...] This did not make him reliable, only that he was careful with the sources and his access to priestly and sacred records allowed him to do what other Babylonians could not. [...] What we have of ancient Mesopotamian myth is somewhat comparable with Berossus, though the exact integrity with which he transmitted his sources is unknown because much of the literature of Mesopotamia has not survived.
