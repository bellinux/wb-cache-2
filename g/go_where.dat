5|$|In 2007, Meijaard, et al., {{published}} the canonical linearized equations of motion, in the Proceedings of the Royal Society A, along with verification by two different methods. These equations assumed the tires to roll without slip, {{that is to}} say, to <b>go</b> <b>where</b> they point, and the rider to be rigidly attached to the rear frame of the bicycle.|$|E

And then we just sewed it together. It was rather like the way we'd been working on the dance remixes we'd been doing before. Kind of a cut-and-paste method.|$|E
5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses {{are those that are}} formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, he has to <b>go</b> <b>where</b> only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E

Travel as many miles as you like and <b>go</b> <b>where</b> you will, it is highly {{improbable}} that you will find a spot with so many magnificent nature advantages as has St. Johns. The fine stretch of level land on which the city is located, the deep water of the two rivers, the navigable sloughs and the superb scenery which nature has painted with a master hand, makes the location an ideal one in every respect either for industries or residences.|$|E
25|$|In Korea, Chuseok (추석, 秋夕; {{also called}} Hangawi) {{is a major}} {{traditional}} holiday. People <b>go</b> <b>where</b> the spirits of their ancestors are enshrined, and perform ancestral worship rituals early in the morning. They visit the tombs of immediate ancestors to trim plants, clean {{the area around the}} tomb, and offer food, drink, and crops to their ancestors.|$|E
25|$|By X3, the X-Universe {{consists}} of around 160 sectors connected by two-way jumpgates. The main area of each sector typically contains several stations {{and up to}} four gates. The game is open-ended, allowing the player to <b>go</b> <b>where</b> they like, when they like, doing whatever they like; a player is limited only by their in-game status and resources. As such, a driving force {{of the game is}} to acquire credits (the universal currency) and status.|$|E

His clothes were taken away and he was returned to the freezing cell wearing only a flimsy hospital gown.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of New Zealand, the majority of independent Polynesian islands derive much of their income from foreign aid and remittances from {{those who live in}} other countries. Some encourage their young people to <b>go</b> <b>where</b> they can earn good money to remit to their stay-at-home relatives. Many Polynesian locations, such as Easter Island, supplement this with tourism income. Some have more unusual sources of income, such as Tuvalu which marketed its '.tv' internet top-level domain name or the Cooks that relied on postage stamp sales.|$|E
25|$|LaMountain, {{from his}} {{position}} at Fort Monroe, {{had the luxury of}} flying free. When he was enjoined with the Balloon Corps, he began insisting that his reconnaissance flights be made free. Lowe strictly instructed his men against free flight {{as a matter of policy}} and procedure. Eventually the two men agreed to a showdown in which LaMountain made one of his free flights. The flight was a success as a reconnaissance flight with LaMountain being able to <b>go</b> <b>where</b> he would. But on his return he was threatened by Union troops who could not identify him. His balloon was shot down, and LaMountain was treated harshly until he was clearly identified.|$|E

25|$|For much of {{his career}} Flew was known as a strong {{advocate}} of atheism, arguing that one should presuppose atheism until empirical evidence of a God surfaces. He also criticised the idea of life after death, the free will defence to the problem of evil, and the meaningfulness of the concept of God. In 2003 {{he was one of the}} signatories of the Humanist Manifesto III. However, in 2004 he stated an allegiance to deism, more specifically a belief in the Aristotelian God. He stated that in keeping his lifelong commitment to <b>go</b> <b>where</b> the evidence leads, he now believed in the existence of a God.|$|E
25|$|Then {{there was}} the debate within the Nader {{campaign}} over where to travel in {{the waning days of}} the campaign. Some Nader advisers urged him to spend his time in uncontested states such as New York and California. These states – where liberals and leftists could entertain the thought of voting Nader without fear of aiding Bush – offered the richest harvest of potential votes. But, Martin writes, Nader – who emerges from this account as the house radical of his own campaign – insisted on spending {{the final days of the}} campaign on a whirlwind tour of battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Florida. In other words, he chose to <b>go</b> <b>where</b> the votes were scarcest, jeopardizing his own chances of winning 5 percent of the vote, which he needed to gain federal funds in 2004.|$|E
25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to <b>go</b> <b>where</b> the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E

25|$|On Earth, Eben and Martha Kent find Kal-El in the {{spacecraft}} and pull him from {{it before it}} explodes. The Kents decide to raise him as their own and name him Clark. Clark is shown learning about his abilities as he grows up, displaying great strength and speed, x-ray vision, super hearing and super durability. Once Clark is an adult, Eben explains how he and Martha found him and that Clark {{has a responsibility to}} use his powers wisely and justly in the interest of truth, tolerance and justice. They agree that the world needs him and that he must leave their farm and <b>go</b> <b>where</b> he is needed. Clark states that he will pursue a job that will keep him close to world events, so he can be aware of emergencies immediately. Martha gives Clark a uniform made from the blankets they found him in and he decides to take on the secret identity Superman. The Kents die shortly after this conversation and Clark moves to Metropolis.|$|E
