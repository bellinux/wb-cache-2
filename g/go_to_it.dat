500|$|The {{negative}} views towards Wollstonecraft persisted {{for over}} a century. The Rights of Woman was not reprinted {{until the middle of}} the 19th century and it still retained an aura of ill-repute. George Eliot wrote [...] "there is in some quarters a vague prejudice against the Rights of Woman as in some way or other a reprehensible book, but readers who <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> with this impression will be surprised to find it eminently serious, severely moral, and withal rather heavy".|$|E
500|$|Barker was {{released}} from a local emergency room after three hours of treatment and observation for a concussion and an eye that had swollen shut. The emergency physician's record shows that he also had injuries to his face, ears, and hand. He [...] attended his school's class ring ceremony and dance that evening. He later testified, [...] "I waited 11years to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> I wasn't {{going to let that}} get in my way." [...] He left the dance early due to pain. During the trial, Barker testified that his face was badly swollen after the attack and that he suffered a loss of vision in one eye for three weeks. He said that he had suffered recurring headaches and forgetfulness since the attack.|$|E
500|$|Fionna and Cake {{are helping}} Prince Gumball {{decorate}} for the Biennial Gumball Ball when Gumball asks Fionna {{if she would}} like to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> tonight with him. Their conversation is interrupted when the Ice Queen breaks into the castle and tries to kidnap Gumball. Fionna and Cake start to fight her before she mysteriously disappears. Gumball (who is apparently unharmed) arranges a date with Fionna. At the Tree Fort, Fionna and Cake argue over whether or not Gumball asked Fionna on a date. Cake decides to come along to help Fionna out. At the Castle Gardens, the two are met by Gumball and his steed Lord Monochromicorn. The group then flies through the air while Gumball serenades Fionna with the song [...] "Oh, Fionna" [...] and eventually asks her to be his girlfriend. When Fionna and Cake get to the ball, Prince Gumball takes Fionna to his room (decorated with candles and rose petals) and locks the door. She becomes flustered and backs away when he begins to take his shirt off. A drop of water lands on her shoulder, she looks up to see the real Prince Gumball trapped inside a giant icicle on the ceiling. The fake prince is revealed to be Ice Queen. Fionna is soon incapacitated; Cake senses trouble and rushes to her rescue.|$|E

2500|$|From 1936 to 1940 Flanders was a pupil at Westminster School, {{where his}} contemporaries {{included}} Peter Ustinov, Peter Brook, Tony Benn and Donald Swann. [...] In his last term in 1940, he and Swann collaborated {{on a school}} revue called <b>Go</b> <b>To</b> <b>It!.</b> From Westminster, Flanders went up to Christ Church, Oxford, to read history. There he acted and directed for the Oxford University Dramatic Society and the Experimental Theatre Club. His roles included Brabantio in Othello, Pirandello's Henry IV and Shawcross in Auden and Isherwood's The Ascent of F6. He also wrote drama criticisms for the Oxford magazine Cherwell. In October 1941 he made his professional acting debut at the Oxford Playhouse as Valentine in Shaw's You Never Can Tell. His biographer and Oxford contemporary Michael Meyer writes of Flanders in this period: ...|$|E
2500|$|As with {{previous}} sessions, Mike Sapone acted {{as both a}} band member and co-producer, while the band were also involved in the albums production. Discussing Sapone's involvement, Lacey defined Sapone as having [...] "as much at stake with the music as we do; he's as invested in it as we are, sometimes more." [...] Accardi described Sapone as having [...] "an uncanny ability to hear something you’re doing and immediately track it to any song in his library that he stores in his brain. He'll <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> {{show it to you}} and tell you that that’s what needs to happen. Here's the better version of it. This is what you’re trying to do and you don't even realize it." [...] Most of the songs were brought to the studio in acoustic form, sometimes as a complete song and sometimes as just a part or riff. The band would then build upon these ideas, recording everything as they worked. The band members were not limited by their normal roles within Brand New, with much instrument swapping and experimenting taking place in writing individual parts. Lacey later commented that [...] "it was such a collaborative effort with the band. Vin might write a drum part or Brian might write a guitar part or whatever. We're not really keeping tabs of how much everyone has at stake on each song".|$|E
2500|$|The company {{first began}} as Mpath Interactive, a venture capital {{start-up}} co-founded in early 1995 by Brian Apgar, Jeff Rothschild and Brian Moriarty, based in Cupertino, California. It was later renamed to HearMe. [...] Mpath Interactive later moved to Mountain View, California, after acquiring Catapult Entertainment, Inc., and their online gaming service XBAND. [...] Mplayer {{began as a}} division in October 1996 to provide online gaming to subscribed users. [...] A few months prior to launching Mplayer, Mpath announced their goal for the service in a job description: Not only will people go to the Internet for information, they will also <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> to [...] meet and interact with other people. Mplayer, scheduled to debut 1996, will bring the excitement of real-time multi-player gaming to the Internet's World Wide Web for the first time. [...] It will feature popular PC-based games from well-known game publishers. Mplayer's features will include voice-capable games and chat rooms where players can converse as they play the games, watch games in progress and choose teams or opponents. In February 1997, they began to offer internet play for free for their major commercial games such as Quake, as well as card and board games such as Scrabble and Spades. In this, they {{were one of the}} first major commercial communities on the internet to offer such a service. They continued to add many new games to their offering. [...] The slogan that was used from its founding was [...] "Wanna Play?" [...] By the end of 1998, the company had a staff of 111 employees, and about 80 by late 2000. [...] The company was listed on NASDAQ beginning April 29, 1999 as MPTH, which changed to HEAR by late September of the same year.|$|E
