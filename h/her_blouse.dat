5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) asks Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to {{accompany}} him to the Six Sigmas Retreat in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, following his Bush administration and CEO debacles. There, Jack meets with the Six Sigmas, six men who each embody a core feature of Six Sigma: teamwork, insight, brutality, male enhancement, hand-shake-fulness and play-hard. They disapprove of Liz's antics during the team building exercises and demand that Jack distance himself from her {{if he wants to}} succeed, which he does. Before his dinner speech, Jack psyches himself up in the men's room, completely forgetting that he is wearing a microphone and that everyone can hear him. Liz quickly takes the stage to draw attention away from Jack's embarrassment and finally ends up ripping <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> open and dancing in front of everyone. She succeeds, and is banned from the retreat forever.|$|E

500|$|McCracken {{was noted}} for her {{eccentric}} behavior. She was uninhibited, {{and at times}} seemed to enjoy behaving outrageously. In one meeting with MGM vocal coach Kay Thompson, she removed <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> and bra to become [...] "more comfortable." ...|$|E

Clara, suffering, {{followed}} Paul into the kitchen. Mrs. Morel rose. Clara thought her a lady, even rather stiff. The young woman was very nervous. She had almost a wistful look, almost resigned.|$|R
500|$|In 1998, Marshall rejoined Jarrett in the WWF. At the {{beginning}} of her WWF career, known simply as Debra, she played the part of a shrewd businesswoman, wearing business suits. She also played the part of Jarrett's girlfriend. In late 1998, Jarrett began a feud with Goldust that culminated in December at [...] in a [...] "Striptease match". During the match, Debra hit Goldust over the head with Jarrett's trademark guitar, enabling Jarrett to win. WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels, however, disqualified Jarrett, and Debra had to strip due to the match's stipulations. As she stripped, The Blue Blazer and Jarrett covered her up. Debra, however, began utilizing a new strategy during matches, distracting Jarrett's opponents by unbuttoning <b>her</b> <b>blouse.</b> She would willingly take off <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> to show the crowd her [...] "puppies", a nickname originally bestowed upon her chest by wrestler Road Dogg and later utilized by commentator Jerry Lawler.|$|E
500|$|Mostly unconcerned about {{appearance}} and manners, biographers suggest {{she focused on}} her studies. A distinguished algebraist Olga Taussky-Todd described a luncheon, during which Noether, wholly engrossed {{in a discussion of}} mathematics, [...] "gesticulated wildly" [...] as she ate and [...] "spilled her food constantly and wiped it off from her dress, completely unperturbed". Appearance-conscious students cringed as she retrieved the handkerchief from <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> and ignored the increasing disarray of her hair during a lecture. Two female students once approached her during a break in a two-hour class to express their concern, but they were unable to break through the energetic mathematics discussion she was having with other students.|$|E
500|$|On another occasion, {{a prostitute}} {{was brought to}} Jackson's room after a concert in Madison Square Garden. There, the pop star interrogated the sex worker, asking why she was a prostitute, whether {{she wanted to have}} sex with him, and how much it would cost. The woman responded that she was a prostitute for the money, but that she would have sex with him for free because she wanted him. The prostitute then {{proceeded}} to unbutton <b>her</b> <b>blouse,</b> exposing her breasts. Apparently repulsed, Jackson turned his head and begged her to [...] "put them back". The singer suggested that they talk instead but would still pay her, which the prostitute declined to do; she was not there to talk. Instead, she gave Jackson her telephone number, urging him to call her when he wanted to [...] "get off". Jackson acknowledged the prostitute as she left, stating that he would perhaps call her one day, though he never did.|$|E

60|$|Despite Vida Sherwin's lively blue eyes, if you {{had looked}} at her in detail you would have found her face {{slightly}} lined, and not so much sallow as with the bloom rubbed off; you would have found her chest flat, and her fingers rough from needle and chalk and penholder; <b>her</b> <b>blouses</b> and plain cloth skirts undistinguished; and her hat worn too far back, betraying a dry forehead. But you never did look at Vida Sherwin in detail. You couldn't. Her electric activity veiled her. She was as energetic as a chipmunk. Her fingers fluttered; her sympathy came out in spurts; she {{sat on the edge of}} a chair in eagerness to be near her auditor, to send her enthusiasms and optimism across.|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{and she is}} feminine, despite, {{no matter}} how she does her hair, that it is as {{invariably}} smooth and well-groomed as {{all the rest of}} her. On the other hand, this perpetual well-groomedness is relieved by the latitude of dress she allows herself. She never fails of being a woman. Her sex, and the lure of it, is ever present. Possibly she may possess high collars, but I have never seen her in one on board. <b>Her</b> <b>blouses</b> are always open at the throat, disclosing one of her choicest assets, the muscular, adequate neck, with its fine-textured garmenture of skin. I embarrass myself by stealing long glances at that bare throat of hers and at the hint of fine, firm-surfaced shoulder.|$|R

2500|$|One Gong Show episode {{consisted}} of every act appearing singing the song [...] "Feelings", which was popular at the time. One {{of its most}} infamous incidents came on the NBC version in 1978, when Barris presented an onstage act consisting of two young women slowly and suggestively sucking Popsicles. Another incident, which most missed originally, was when during a [...] "Gene Gene, The Dancing Machine" [...] episode, Jaye P.

6000|$|He was {{not quite}} honest with himself, or he would have {{acknowledged}} the pleasure he took in watching Elsie's erect and graceful figure as she rode past his office window of a morning. It was pleasant to pause at {{the open door of}} her studio for a moment and say [...] "Good-morning," [...] though he received but a cold and formal bow in return. She was more alluring at her easel than in any other place, for she had several curious and very pretty tricks in working, and seemed like a very intent child, with her brown hair loosening over her temples, her eyes glowing with excitement, while she dabbed at the canvas with a piece of cheese-cloth or a crumb of bread. She dragged her stool into position with a quick, amusing jerk, holding her brush in her teeth meanwhile. <b>Her</b> <b>blouses</b> were marvels of odd grace and rich color.|$|R

He meets his solicitor, Hugo, to arrange a settlement with Marsha, pressing charges for sexual intimidation and indecent assault. Marsha arrives with Simeon, her own solicitor. Hugo starts by asking Marsha and Simeon to establish {{the facts of the}} case, but when Marsha confirms she was dressed as a clown, Hugo suggests Charlie wouldn't have known she was a woman, and turns the meeting into a belittling interrogation, a mini-courtroom drama.

60|$|For {{six weeks}} he was ill. He seemed daily to lose {{more of the}} boyishness which all his life had {{made him want to}} dance in the sun. That loss was to Ruth like a snickering hobgoblin {{attending}} the specter of death.

He was not shaved every day; he had a pale beard under his hollow cheeks....

2500|$|Russell's {{measurements}} were 38D-24-36, {{and she stood}} 5ft 7 in (97-61-91cm and 1.7 m), making her more statuesque than most of her contemporaries.

And if all eyes (and cameras) are on her chest, Jackson, 38, responds defiantly by refusing to cloak her breasts in a modest turtleneck. The cleavage is her way of saying 'fuck you.'" [...] In 2006, during an interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Jackson upheld her claim that the Super Bowl scandal was an accident.|$|E
60|$|She checked {{a torrent}} of words. Her bosom was heaving {{underneath}} <b>her</b> lace <b>blouse.</b> She was pale almost to the lips. The sudden and complete disuse of all manner of cosmetics had {{to a certain extent}} blanched her face. There was room there now for the writing of tragedy. Borrowdean, still outwardly suave, was inwardly cursing the unlucky chance which had blown the telegram her way.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most notorious}} scandal {{followed}} {{an incident in}} Rostov-on-Don on 20 May 2004.
