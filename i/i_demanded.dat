25|$|Despite {{the peace}} treaty, the {{relationship}} between the two countries remained tense. Sigismund <b>I</b> <b>demanded</b> extradition of Michael Glinski for trial, while Vasili III demanded better treatment of his widowed sister Helena. Vasili also discovered that Sigismund was paying Khan Meñli I Giray to attack the Grand Duchy of Moscow. At the same time, Albert of Prussia became the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights and was unwilling to acknowledge Poland's suzerainty as required by the Second Peace of Thorn (1466). The tension eventually resulted in the Polish–Teutonic War (1519–21) and allied Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor with Vasili III.|$|E
25|$|Especially for mining {{projects}} in upper Hungary the Fugger company required enormous capital, {{which at the}} time it could not raise. Hence Cardinal Melchior von Meckau was the main sponsor of the Fugger business in 1496. The Prince-Bishop had secretly and unknown to his church chapter invested 150.000 guilders into the Fugger company in return for interest, thereby evading the official church ban on interest. When he died in Rome in 1509 this investment was uncovered. The Pope, the bishopric Brixen and the family of Meckau all claiming the inheritance now demanded the immediate payback of these assets which would have resulted in insolvency for Jakob Fugger. It was this situation that prompted Emperor Maximilian I to step in and assist his banker. On the condition of assisting Pope Julius II in a war against the Republic of Venice the Habsburg monarch was recognized as being the rightful heir of Cardinal Melchior von Meckau. The inheritance could now be settled by amortizing outstanding debts. Fugger also had to deliver jewels as compensation to the Pope. However, in return for his support, Maximilian <b>I</b> <b>demanded</b> the continuous financial support of his ongoing military and political campaigns.|$|E
500|$|However, on Ranald's death, Godfrey seized Garmoran, {{leading to}} an {{enormous}} amount of violence between him and Ranald's heirs (Clan Ranald). In 1427, frustrated with the level of violence, King James <b>I</b> <b>demanded</b> that highland leaders should attend a meeting at Inverness. On arrival, many of the leaders were seized and imprisoned; after a quick show trial of Godfrey's heir, and in view of Clan Ranald being no less responsible for the violence, King James declared the Lordship of Garmoran forfeit.|$|E

That is how a segment of the black community that lives in Compton, lives in Inglewood, where Jackie Brown takes place, that lives in Carson, that is how they talk. I'm telling the truth. It would not be questioned if I was black, and I resent the question because I'm white. I have the right to tell the truth. I do {{not have the right to}} lie.|$|R
500|$|Bonham's Case {{was deeply}} unpopular with the Crown; Coke {{was removed from}} the Common Pleas and sent to the King's Bench, in theory a more senior office but in {{practice}} a less rewarding one in 1613. In June 1616, he was suspended from office and ordered to [...] "correct" [...] his case reports. In October 1617, James <b>I</b> <b>demanded</b> an explanation from Coke of the reasoning behind Bonham's Case. Coke claimed that [...] "the words of my report do not import any new opinion, but only a relation of such authorities of law, as had been adjudged and resolved in former times, and were cited in the argument of Bonham's case". He refused to admit to any flaws with his writings, and his only corrections were minor errors and rearrangements of the language. If he meant the case as an endorsement of judicial review instead of Parliamentary sovereignty, withdrawal of that endorsement has been inferred from his later writings.|$|E
500|$|Jaws was {{the first}} major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, {{resulting}} in a troubled shoot that went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget [...] "was $4million and the picture wound up costing $9million"; the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks. Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname [...] "Flaws". Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; [...] "I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same," [...] he said. As for his lack of experience: [...] "I was naive about the ocean, basically. I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who thinks he can conquer the elements was foolhardy, but I was too young to know I was being foolhardy when <b>I</b> <b>demanded</b> that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank." [...] Gottlieb said that [...] "there was nothing to do except make the movie", so everyone kept overworking, and while as a writer {{he did not have to}} attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived [...] "ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water".|$|E

2500|$|When {{his army}} surrendered, Charles XII of Sweden {{and a few}} {{soldiers}} escaped to Ottoman territory, founding a colony in front of Bender, Moldova. Peter <b>I</b> <b>demanded</b> Charles's eviction, and when the sultan refused, Peter decided to force it by invading the Ottoman Empire. Peter's army was trapped by an Ottoman army at the Pruth river. Peter managed to negotiate a retreat, making a few territorial concessions and promising to withdraw his forces from the Holy Roman Empire as well as allowing Charles's return to Sweden. These terms were {{laid out in the}} Treaty of Adrianople (1713). Charles showed no interest in returning, established a provisional court in his colony, and sought to persuade the sultan to engage in an Ottoman-Swedish assault on Russia. The sultan {{put an end to the}} generous hospitality granted and had the king arrested in what became known as the [...] "kalabalik" [...] in 1713. Charles was then confined at Timurtash and Demotika; later he abandoned his hopes for an Ottoman front and returned to Sweden in a 14-day ride.|$|E
