Driver B also loses control of her car, comes off the road, but doesn’t hit a pedestrian and therefore doesn’t run anyone over because there was no pedestrian.

40|$|Building on food {{security}} Cue: If small-scale farmers aren?t {{even able to}} grow enough food for their families, they certainly aren?t ready to think about cash crop production. All across Africa, millions of small farmers feel trapped in low productivity, with no way of improving either their {{food security}} or their livelihood. And for many farmers in Zambia, life {{in the last ten}} years has become more difficult not less; a succession of droughts combined with a government policy for economic liberalisation, have cut farm productivity among poorer farmers in particular. For Zambia?s Programme Against Malnutrition, known as ?Pam?, the challenge is greater than ever. This non-government organisation is now working closely with the Zambian government, through a variety of initiatives, to support small-scale farmers. The ?food security pack? scheme, for example, is currently distributing vital farming inputs, such as seed and fertilizer, to the most needy. But beyond that, the programme has also recognised the importance of farmers being able to get real economic benefits from any increase in their production. Daniel Sikazwe sent us this report on the work of the Programme Against Malnutrition in his home country, Zambia. IN:		?Ten years ago, Zambia ? OUT:		?value to food crops. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 44 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That report came from Daniel Sikazwe, and featured Mlotha Damaseke, manager of the food security pack scheme, for the Programme Against Malnutrition in Zambia. Transcript Sikazwe	Ten years ago, Zambia embarked on an ambitious liberalisation programme; subsidies in crucial areas like agriculture were removed. Some small-scale farmers found themselves out of business, while others persevered. In this programme we will try to establish what impacts liberalisation has had on small-scale farmers; how those who have continued with their farming activities have managed to stay alive in the midst of an uncertain food security situation. Mr. Mlotha Damaseke is the food security pack manager at the Programme Against Malnutrition, PAM, a non-governmental organisation that has been working with small-scale farmers over the years. What did liberalisation entail on small-scale farmers? Damaseke	The main problem is in terms of input supply. The country is quite big, the infrastructure for service delivery, is quite poor, and that left them very very vulnerable. Most of the people who are benefiting are large-scale farmers who are along the main trunk roads, but eighty percent of our producers, especially for staple foods, are small-scale farmers. This has had an adverse effect on the amount of food that is produced in the country. Sikazwe	I?ve come across a lot of small-scale farmers that have talked about working with the Programme Against Malnutrition, and that they have somehow managed to rise above the impacts of liberalisation. Can you just tell me what PAM has been doing with the small-scale farmers? Damaseke	Yes indeed. PAM was implementing a number of interventions, some of which are coming from government initiatives. For example the food security pack is targeting the small-scale farmers who have been left helpless by the liberalisation of the economy, and the droughts that have been persisting since 1991, and therefore we are assisting the farmers with inputs; so we are delivering inputs to small-scale farmers throughout the country, so that they can become productive once again, and maybe go into a commercial lending portfolio. Sikazwe	Well once you have delivered these inputs to the small-scale farmers, they produce, they need to have a market but then they are competing against heavily subsidised goods coming from South Africa, and probably some other countries. Are there any attempts by the Programme Against Malnutrition to try and help them get a market to try to rise above the challenges of liberalisation? Damaseke	In fact, as a way of addressing that problem, the programme has got a component, which is looking at management of excess produce. It?s called the cereal or seed bank component. This is a concept where communities themselves, come together; they make their own storage facilities. The aim to do that is: one, you have small-scale farmers coming at one point, putting in, each one brings whether it is one tin, or it?s one bag, or it?s ten bags, they get an inventory of each person who brings excess produce. And then they can decide when to sell. If they want to keep it for a longer period so that they can sell it when the price is right, for example during the start of the rainy season in January or February, then they sell the excess crop. So that is one way of enhancing the profitability of farming. Sikazwe	Well, there has been an argument that some small-scale farmers have been small-scale farmers for a long time; they need to graduate. And attempts that effect to make them graduate into, maybe not commercial farmers, but at least above small-scale farmers, through the aid or help that the Programme Against Malnutrition is giving to the small-scale farmers? Damaseke	Yes, the efforts are there. I think what is important is for people to realise is that before a person can feed himself or herself, there is no way that they will grow bigger. Firstly they must solve the first problem; the first problem is hunger in the house. If he solves the problem of hunger in the household, then he will think of having more. And therefore, efforts are being made to see that those who are able to feed themselves for one year, and have excess, maybe be linked to for example, the micro-bankers trust, who can lend them, on terms that they are able to pay back, and then become bigger farmers. So that is one initiative that the small-scale farmers must look for. They should not remain subsistence farmers. Sikazwe	Liberalisation has surely come to stay in Zambia. How do you look at the future of small-scale farmers? Damaseke	<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> take the initiative. The way the formation of co-operatives. If co-operatives are formed where people come together, they buy inputs together, that should be the way to go. Another way is contract cropping by out-grower schemes, that is another way to go. And also adding value to their crop; processing foods so that they don?t go to waste when they are in abundance. Whether it?s groundnuts; is it just roasting, or are you going to make peanut butter and things like that. So there is a component that is looking at adding value to food crops. End of track. The Food Security Pack manager with Zambia?s Programme Against Malnutrition explains how the programme is working to support small-scale farmers, and help them move from better food security towards commercial production...|$|E

We implemented a multi-pronged informatics intervention, based on Dual Process Theory, to prompt discontinuation of unwarranted vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam on or after day three in a large Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Two workflow changes were introduced to facilitate cognitive deliberation about continuing antibiotics at day three: (1) teams completed an electronic template note, and (2) a paper summary of clinical and antibiotic-related information was provided to clinical teams. Shortly after starting the intervention, six focus groups were conducted with users or potential users. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Iterative thematic analysis identified recurrent themes from feedback. Themes that emerged are represented by the following quotations: (1) captures and controls attention ("it reminds us to think about it"), (2) enhances informed and deliberative reasoning ("it makes you think twice"), (3) redirects decision direction ("…because [there was no indication] I just [discontinued] it without even trying"), (4) fosters autonomy and improves team empowerment ("the template… forces the team to really discuss it"), and (5) limits use of emotion-based heuristics ("my clinical concern is high enough <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> more aggressive therapy…"). Requiring template completion to continue antibiotics nudged clinicians to re-assess the appropriateness of specified antibiotics.

In central Malawi, for example, some groups of women have recently begun adding value to the wild, edible mushrooms that they collect in a nearby forest reserve. They have been helped by Meg Faville, a Peace Corps volunteer living in the area, who has encouraged the women to improve their handling and marketing of the mushrooms, building on their traditional knowledge. Patrick Mphaka recently traveled to Zithani village in Kasungu district to meet Meg, {{and to find out}} more about the progress the women have made. IN:		?I was trying to stress to the women ? OUT:		? about their newly acquired knowledge. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 16 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Patrick Mphaka was reporting from central Malawi. Transcript Faville	I was trying to stress to the women that it?s very important how you package and how you process your mushrooms to sell them in a way that is both sanitary and also in a way that is eye-catching. So what we did is I gave every woman some soap to wash her hands before then we did a short talk about how to keep things clean while you are handling mushrooms that will be sold to the public. And we also talked a bit about marketing and having a nice label that says ?From the Forest? (that we collected it from). That it was harvested by women and that they had formed this group to generate some income for their families. So, what we are doing is basically trying to empower the women to start their business and make it something that can be sustained in the future. Mphaka	Sustainability. The word we talk a lot about in development circles, but have so little, if any to show off about. A very difficult concept to achieve. Meg agrees, but is set to achieve it nevertheless. Faville	It?s a very difficult thing sustainability, and we use the word very often. But for myself, there are small ways that you can ensure sustainability that I am trying to do with the women here. First of all, it takes motivation and it takes knowledge. If these women had no idea how to find mushrooms or what mushrooms to find, then we would not have a business in the first place. So that traditional knowledge is there. So that is something they can pass on to their children, and their children can therefore sustain the business as far as maintaining that sense of knowledge and sense of guardianship towards the bush. Mphaka	One of the elements of sustainability, according to Meg, is to be able to know the measurements. How much, or how many, are you selling, and how much money will it fetch. Faville	That also ties into sustainability. We are using our creativity to create these packaged goods. For instance, the scale that we use to measure is the same scale that they measure the children every month for the early development, maintaining the weight every month, as you know. So what I do, as I alone did not measure those bags, but we made sure there was one woman in the group that knew very well how to measure. And she can in turn teach others in the future, or measure alone the next time. Mphaka	When you sit here in this village. You look around at what is happening, what do you think the outside world can do to help the people in the village so that in future, they can be self sufficient? Faville	<b>I</b> <b>think</b> that?s a problem actually is looking to the outside world instead of looking within. Women here are very strong, stronger than a lot of women that I have seen in America, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> have to recognize that within themselves, to see that they are not alone. And they also are not unable to be self reliant. They have the traditional knowledge, and they have the strength and the togetherness to make some very wonderful things accomplished here. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> someone may be from the outside like me to recognize that in them and try to empower them to be more self sufficient. Mphaka	Meg Faville, a Peace Corp volunteer resident in Zithani village in the outskirts of Chimaliro Forest in Kasungu district. Meanwhile, there are less unprocessed mushrooms for sale by the roadside in the area because the women have seen the value of processing their product. They are now happier and can sing praises about their newly acquired knowledge. (SFX - women?s song fades out). End of track.

Caldershaws, {{you must}} know, {{is one of the}} most disreputable districts in Edinburgh. One of my clerks (whom I am in the habit of employing confidentially) volunteered to inquire for 'Dandie' at 'Number Nine.' It was a ticklish business in every way; and my man wisely took a person with him who was known in the neighborhood. 'Number Nine' turned out to be (ostensibly) a shop for the sale of rags and old iron; and 'Dandie' was suspected of trading now and then, additionally, as a receiver of stolen goods. Thanks to the influence of his companion, backed by a bank-note (which can be repaid, by the way, out of the fund for the American expenses), my clerk succeeded is making the fellow speak. Not to trouble you with needless details, the result in substance was this: A fortnight or more before the date of Mrs. Eustace's death, 'Dandie' made two keys from wax models supplied to him by a new customer. The mystery observed in the matter by the agent who managed it excited Dandie's distrust. He had the man privately watched before he delivered the keys; and he ended in discovering that his customer was--Miserrimus Dexter. Wait a little! I have not done yet. Add to this information Dexter's incomprehensible knowledge of the contents of your husband's diary, and the product is--that the wax models sent to the old-iron shop in Caldershaws were models taken by theft from the key of the Diary and the key of the table-drawer in which it was kept. I have my own idea of the revelations that are still to come if this matter is properly followed up. Never mind going into that at present. Dexter (I tell you again) is answerable for the late Mrs. Eustace's death. How he is answerable I believe you are in a fair way of finding out.
