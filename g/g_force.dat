The radar set {{had to be made}} small enough to fit inside a shell, and its glass vacuum tubes had to first withstand the 20,000 <b>g</b> <b>force</b> of being fired from a gun, and then 500 rotations per second in flight.

2500|$|Kenny G {{signed with}} Arista Records {{as a solo}} artist in 1982, after label {{president}} Clive Davis heard his rendition of ABBA's [...] "Dancing Queen". He released his self-titled first album {{with the help of}} The Jeff Lorber Fusion. The album received warm reviews from critics. He achieved success quite early on, with both <b>G</b> <b>Force</b> and Gravity, his second and third studio albums respectively, achieving platinum status in the United States. At that time he collaborated with Kashif on many tracks, such as the single Love on the Rise, which was released in 1985 and went on to chart. His fourth studio album, Duotones, sold over five million copies in the U.S. alone. It featured the songs [...] "Songbird", with reached #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single [...] "Don't Make Me Wait for Love", which featured vocals from Lenny Williams, charted at #15 on the Hot 100, and #2 on the Adult Contemporary charts in 1987. Kenny G worked in the mid-to-late 1980s with jazz and R artists such as George Benson, Patti LaBelle and Aretha Franklin. The 1987 hit-single [...] "Love Power", a Dionne Warwick duet with Jeffrey Osborne that featured G as a guest saxophonist, peaked at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100, and #5 on R/Hip-Hop songs. His first live album, titled Kenny G Live, included popular songs, among which [...] "Going Home" [...] achieved great success in the People's Republic of China. G has collaborated {{with a wide variety of}} artists, such as Andrea Bocelli, Aaron Neville, Toni Braxton, DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, Natalie Cole, Steve Miller, Weezer, Dudley Moore, Lee Ritenour, The Rippingtons, Michael Bolton, Celine Dion, Frank Sinatra, Bebel Gilberto and Smokey Robinson. Influenced by the likes of saxophonist Grover Washington, Jr., his own albums are usually classified as smooth jazz.|$|E

40|$|The {{extent of}} actin {{polymerization}} in unstimulated, discoid platelets {{was measured by}} DNase I inhibition assay in Triton X- 100 lysates of platelets washed at 37 degrees C by gel filtration, or in Triton X- 100 lysates of platelets washed at ambient temperatures by centrifugation {{in the presence of}} prostacyclin. About 40 % of the actin in the discoid platelets obtained by either method existed as filaments. These filaments could be visualized by electron microscopy of thin sections. Similar results were obtained when the actin filament content of discoid platelets was measured by sedimentation of filaments from Triton X- 100 lysates at high <b>g</b> <b>forces</b> (145, 000 <b>g</b> for 45 min). However, few of these filaments sedimented at the lower <b>g</b> <b>forces</b> often used to isolate networks of actin filaments from cell extracts. These results indicate that actin filaments in discoid cells are not highly crosslinked. Platelets isolated by centrifugation in the absence of prostacyclin were not discoid, but were instead irregular with one or more pseudopodia. These platelets also contained approximately 40 - 50 % of their actin in a filamentous form; many of these filaments sedimented at low <b>g</b> <b>forces,</b> however, indicating that they were organized into networks. The discoid shape of these centrifuged platelets could be restored by incubating them for 1 - 3 h at 37 degrees C, which resulted in the reversal of filament organization. High <b>g</b> <b>forces</b> were then required for the sedimentation of the actin. Approximately 80 - 90 % of the actin in platelets washed at 4 degrees C was filamentous; this high actin filament content could be attributed to actin polymerization during the preparation of the platelets at low temperatures. These studies show that platelet activation involves mechanisms for the structural reorganization of existing filaments, in addition to those previously described for mediating actin polymerization...|$|R

50|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of {{intervertebral disc}} injury after spaceflight {{has not been}} clearly identified. The documented expansion of disc volume after spaceflight, together with the intervertebral disc injuries after reloading in Earth's gravity, suggests that the adaptive changes of the intervertebral disc in weightlessness disrupts the balance between osmotic pressure of the nucleus pulposus and the resistive collagen structure of the anuli fibrosi, thereby reducing {{the ability of the}} intervertebral disc structure to withstand re-exposure to <b>G</b> <b>forces.</b> Repeated, previous exposures to excessive <b>G</b> <b>forces</b> in high-performance jets may also have weakened the intervertebral disc structures, particularly in the cervical vertebrae, increasing the susceptibility of these discs to damage. The relative risk of spaceflight-induced intervertebral disc injury needs to be delineated by comparing the absolute risks of the astronaut population with that of a terrestrial control cohort with similar flight history.|$|R
