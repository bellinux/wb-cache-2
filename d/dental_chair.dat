25|$|Southwick, local {{physician}} George E. Fell, and {{the head}} of the Buffalo ASPCA performed a series of experiments electrocuting hundreds of stray dogs, experimenting with animals in water, out of water, electrode types and placement, and conductive material until they came up with a repeatable method to euthanize animals using electricity. Southwick went on in the early 1880s to advocate that this method be used as a more humane replacement for hanging in capital cases, coming to national attention when he published his ideas in scientific journals in 1882 and 1883. He worked out calculations based on the dog experiments, trying to develop a scaled-up method that would work on humans. Early on in his designs he adopted a modified version of the <b>dental</b> <b>chair</b> as a way to restrain the condemned, a device that from then on would be referred called the electric chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "When our brigade {{first went}} into {{camp on the}} Potomac, {{we used to be}} brought up standing, occasionally, by an ear-splitting howl of anguish. That meant that a soldier was getting a tooth pulled in a tent. But the {{surgeons}} soon changed that; they instituted open-air dentistry. There never was a howl afterward--that is, from the man who was having the tooth pulled. At the daily dental hour there would always be about five hundred soldiers gathered together in the neighborhood of that <b>dental</b> <b>chair</b> waiting to see the performance--and help; and the moment the surgeon took a grip on the candidate's tooth and began to lift, every one of those five hundred rascals would clap his hand to his jaw and begin to hop around on one leg and howl with all the lungs he had!

40|$|This study {{compares the}} colony counts of dental unit waterlines (DUWLs) between <b>dental</b> <b>chairs</b> and {{simulation}} chairs of four simulation {{units in the}} dental clinic room of the Charité/Berlin. Water samples were collected from the drinking water, the high speed handpiece before and after flushing for two minutes, the air-water-syringe and the cup filler. In lean to the guidelines 100 colony forming units per ml (CFU/ml) served as a benchmark for classifying into harmless and alarming results. The simulation chairs have generally higher colony counts than the <b>dental</b> <b>chairs.</b> At 22 °C 29 % of the samples of the simulation chairs have alarming colony counts, at 36 °C it is an amount of 47 %. The water samples of the <b>dental</b> <b>chairs</b> which were incubated at 22 °C have drinking water quality. 6 % of those which were incubated at 36 °C have colony counts over 100 CFU/ml. That {{is because of the}} continuous disinfection of the water lines of the <b>dental</b> <b>chairs</b> with the disinfectant Alpron®. The simulation chairs received no disinfection. The water of the high speed handpiece (7 % at 22 °C and 61 % at 36 °C) and the water from the air-water-syringe (43 % at 22 °C and 57 % at 36 °C) have the most colony counts. In the drinking water no alarming colony counts were detected. In 7 % of the 36 °C-samples of the water of the cup filler colony counts over 100 CFU/ml were detected. It has been shown on the example of the high speed handpiece that the colony counts significantly were reduced after a two-minute flushing of the water line. With an incubation temperature of 22 °C in 64 % of the samples alarming colony counts were found. After flushing it were 7 %. In addition to the countable colonies there were also found so-called microcolonies - to small to count according to the requirements of the Drinking Water Guidelines. The microcolonies were detected at each water sample point - even in the drinking water and the water of the cup filler. The results illustrate the benefit of a continuous disinfection of the DUWLs at all dental working places and the need for a regular flushing of the water lines, because water from a dental unit can be heavily contaminated with microorganisms...|$|R
