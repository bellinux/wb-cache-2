By disconnecting the load from the PTO under these conditions, the overrunning clutch improves safety.

40|$|In this experiment, we {{investigated}} whether the Central Nervous System uses internal forward models of <b>inertial</b> <b>loads</b> {{to maintain the}} stability of a precision grip when manipulating objects {{in the absence of}} gravity. The micro-gravity condition causes profound changes in the profile of tangential constraints at the finger-object interface. In order to assess the ability to predict the micro-gravity-specific variation of <b>inertial</b> <b>loads,</b> we analyzed the grip force adjustments that occurred when naïve subjects held an object in a precision grip and performed point-to-point movements under the weightless condition induced by parabolic flight. Such movements typically presented static and dynamic phases, which permitted distinction between a static component of the grip force (measured before the movement) and a dynamic component of the grip force (measured during the movement). The static component tended to gradually decrease across the parabolas, whereas the dynamic component was rapidly modulated with the micro-gravity-specific <b>inertial</b> <b>loads.</b> In addition, the amplitude of the modulation significantly correlated with the amplitude of the tangential constraints for the dynamic component. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the internal representation of arm and object dynamics adapts to new gravitational contexts. In addition, the difference in timescales of adaptation of static and dynamic components suggests that they can be processed independently. The prediction of self-induced variation of <b>inertial</b> <b>loads</b> permits fine modulation of grip force, which ensures a stable grip during manipulation of an object in a new environment...|$|R

Using normalized differential equations relating dimensionless quantities we show, by solving the equations either analytically or numerically, that one dimensionless constant (Xi), representing the <b>inertial</b> <b>load,</b> {{is sufficient to}} specify the behaviour during shortening of a muscle-tendon complex with linear force-velocity and force-extension properties. In the presence of gravity, an additional constant (Gamma), representing the gravitational acceleration, is required. Nonlinear force-velocity and force-extension relationships each introduce an additional constant, representing their curvature. In the absence of gravity the power output delivered to an <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> is limited to approximately 1. 4 times the maximum power of the muscle alone, and when gravity is present the power delivered is limited to approximately twice the power of muscle alone. These limits are found for the purely <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> at Xi ca. 1 and with gravity acting at XiGamma = 0. 5 with Xi arbitrarily small.

To simulate the friction/slip boundary conditions between the skin and liner, automated surface-to-surface contact was used.

40|$|Dragonfly {{wings are}} highly corrugated, which {{increases}} the stiffness and strength of the wing significantly, and results in a lightweight structure with good aerodynamic performance. How insect wings carry aerodynamic and <b>inertial</b> <b>loads,</b> and how the resonant frequency of the flapping wings is tuned for carrying these loads, is however not fully understood. To study this we made a three-dimensional scan of a dragonfly (Sympetrum vulgatum) fore- and hindwing with a micro-CT scanner. The scans contain the complete venation pattern including thickness variations throughout both wings. We subsequently approximated the forewing architecture with an efficient three-dimensional beam and shell model. We then determined the wing’s natural vibration modes and the wing deformation resulting from analytical estimates of 8 load cases containing aerodynamic and <b>inertial</b> <b>loads</b> (using the finite element solver Abaqus). Based on our computations {{we find that the}} <b>inertial</b> <b>loads</b> are 1. 5 to 3 times higher than aerodynamic pressure loads. We further find that wing deformation is smaller during the downstroke than during the upstroke, due to structural asymmetry. The natural vibration mode analysis revealed that the structural natural frequency of a dragonfly wing in vacuum is 154 Hz, which is approximately 4. 8 times higher than the natural flapping frequency of dragonflies in hovering flight (32. 3 Hz). This insight in the structural properties of dragonfly wings could inspire the design of more effective wings for insect-sized flapping micro air vehicles: The passive shape of aeroelastically tailored wings inspired by dragonflies can in principle be designed more precisely compared to sail like wings —which can make the dragonfly-like wings more aerodynamically effective...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of additional <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> in the training of maximum running speed. The objective of this research was to produce changes in kinematic and dynamic performances of maximum running speed in training with additional inertial loads applica-tion, as well as to determine the adaptive processes that were supposed to significantly influence the maximum running speed in the observed variables. An experiment with parallel groups was carried out during which the effect of experimental factors (<b>inertial</b> <b>load)</b> was on two levels. The first, control group (C), had no additional load. Second, experimental group (EA), ran with load attached to arms, and another group (EL), with load attached to legs. The research included initial and final measure-ments of variables in the phase of maximum speed (25 m- 50 m). The change of kinematic variables recorded by non-contact telemetry measurement (two-dimensional system) of a cycle of strides dur-ing sprint step in the phase of maximum running speed was analyzed.

40|$|Industrial {{applications}} increasingly require actuators {{that offer}} a combination of high force output, large stroke and high accuracy. The ElectroHydraulic Actuator (EHA) was designed by Drs. Habibi and Goldenberg originally as a high-performance actuator for use in robotics. However, {{it was determined that}} the EHA had the potential to achieve high positional accuracy. Little research has been performed in the area of high-accuracy hydraulic positioning systems. Therefore, the objective of this study to achieve nano-scale positional accuracy with the EHA while maintaining large stroke and high force output. It was planned to achieve this objective through modification of the prototype EHA and the use of fuzzy control. During this research project, both hardware and control system modifications to the EHA were performed. A high-precision optical encoder position sensor with a 50 nm resolution was mounted on the <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> to directly measure the position of the load. A number of device drivers were written to interface the MATLAB real-time control environment with the optical encoder and servo motor amplifier. A Sugeno-inference fuzzy controller was designed and implemented in MATLAB. For comparison purposes, a switched-gain controller and a proportional controller were also implemented in the control environment. The performance of the fuzzy controller was compared to the switched-gain controller and the proportional controller in a number of tests. First, the regulatory and tracking performance of the EHA with an <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> of 20 kg was examined. It was determined in the regulatory tests that the positional accuracy of the EHA with the fuzzy controller was excellent, achieving a steady state error of 50 ± 25 nm or less for step inputs in the range 5 cm to 200 nm. The positional accuracy during the tracking tests was found to be reduced compared to the regulatory tests since the actuator did not have sufficient time to settle to final accuracy due to the timevarying input signals. In all cases, {{it was found that the}} positional accuracy of the EHA with the fuzzy controller was significantly greater than with the switched-gain and proportional controllers for both regulatory and tracking signals. Testing with the <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> eliminated or changed was not performed because the position sensor was mounted to the load, making it unfeasible to alter the load during the time frame of this study. The regulatory and tracking performance of the EHA with an <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> of 20 kg plus external resistive loads of 90 to 280 N were investigated. It was found that the positional accuracy of the EHA decreased with the application of an external load to 3. 10 ± 0. 835 µm for a 1 cm step input (90 N load) and 8. 45 ± 0. 400 µm for a 3 cm step input (280 N load). Again, the positional accuracy of the EHA decreased during the tracking tests relative to the regulatory tests, for the reason stated above. This implies that the positional accuracy of the EHA with a resistive load is in the microscale, rather than the nano-scale as was put forth as the objective of this study. Nevertheless, the positional accuracy of the EHA with the fuzzy controller was found to be significantly greater than with the switched-gain and proportional controllers. It is postulated that the increase in positional error observed during the external load tests was due to an increase in cross-port leakage, relative to the <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> tests, caused by the pressure differential induced across the actuator by the external load. Methods of reducing the increase in positional error caused by external loads on the EHA remains an area for future study...|$|E

Adding springs to such oscillating drivetrains can allow to improve the energy efficiency and downsize the actuators.
