In an effort to combat emerging bacterial antibiotic resistance, we synthesize chemical compounds and test for high activity against Gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Our leading active compounds are subjected to a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test and results containing a MIC of 8 ug/ml or less are then tested for minimal binding to <b>human</b> <b>serum</b> <b>protein</b> (HSP). We analyze our active novel compounds through IR and NMR spectroscopy in order to corroborate the structural identity. We continue to search for an antibacterial compound that preserves its minimum inhibitory concentration after being combined with <b>human</b> <b>serum</b> <b>protein</b> as this would be highly effective in destroying disease causing bacteria in the clinical setting...|$|E

40|$|Expression {{levels of}} N-linked glycans derived from <b>human</b> <b>serum</b> glycoproteins {{have been shown}} to change during the {{progression}} of many diseases. Generally, N-glycans released from <b>human</b> <b>serum</b> <b>proteins</b> co-exist with endogenous serum peptides, salts, and other contaminants. Effective removal of these contaminants is essential to obtain the glycan profile of <b>human</b> <b>serum</b> <b>proteins.</b> Here, we developed a sample preparation method for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of N-linked glycans derived from <b>human</b> <b>serum</b> glycoproteins based on a zwitterionic hydrophilic material named Click TE-Cys. The high hydrophilicity of Click TE-Cys, resulting from its unique surface structure and charge distribution, facilitated removal of co-existing salts and endogenous serum peptides. Furthermore, the present enrichment approach was handled in parallel, thus saving time. Using this method, a total of 47 unique N-glycans released from <b>human</b> <b>serum</b> <b>proteins</b> were identified. The intrabatch and interbatch coefficients of variation for the 47 N-linked glycans were 8. 57 % +/- 0. 96 % and 9. 22 % +/- 1. 03 %, respectively. These results demonstrate that the present method is suitable for fast purification of N-linked glycans derived from <b>human</b> <b>serum</b> glycoproteins, and has potential for clinical application...|$|R

The prepared HAP had high adsorption capacity to <b>human</b> <b>serum</b> <b>protein</b> and the adsorption of <b>human</b> <b>serum</b> <b>protein</b> on the surface of HAP was confirmed by SEM. The factors which influenced the adsorption capacity such as the acidity, reaction time and the concentration of adsorbent were investigated in detail and the adsorption isothermal was also obtained. The adsorption capacity reduced while the pH value increased, and the adsorption reached equilibrium when shaking time was up to 40 min. The adsorption isotherm could be fitted by the pseudo-Langmuir type. The adsorption of human serum albumin on HAP was investigated, and the influences of adsorption on the conformation of human serum albumin were studied by infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopy.

40|$|With the {{potential}} wide uses of nanoparticles such as carbon nanotubes in biomedical applications, {{and the growing}} concerns of nanotoxicity of these engineered nanoparticles, the importance of nanoparticle–protein interactions cannot be stressed enough. In this study, we use both experimental and theoretical approaches, including atomic force microscope images, fluorescence spectroscopy, CD, SDS-PAGE, and molecular dynamics simulations, to investigate the interactions of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with <b>human</b> <b>serum</b> <b>proteins,</b> and find a competitive binding of these proteins with different adsorption capacity and packing modes. The π-π stacking interactions between SWCNTs and aromatic residues (Trp, Phe, Tyr) are found to {{play a critical role}} in determining their adsorption capacity. Additional cellular cytotoxicity assays, with human acute monocytic leukemia cell line and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, reveal that the competitive bindings of blood proteins on the SWCNT surface can greatly alter their cellular interaction pathways and result in much reduced cytotoxicity for these protein-coated SWCNTs, according to their respective adsorption capacity.

40|$|The human {{commensal}} bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is renowned as a causative agent of severe invasive diseases. Upon entering the bloodstream, S. aureus can infect almost every tissue and organ {{system in the}} human body. To withstand insults from the immune system upon invasion, several immune-evasive mechanisms have evolved in S. aureus, such as complement inhibition by secreted proteins and IgG-binding by surface-exposed protein A. While it is generally accepted that S. aureus cells bind a range of host factors for various purposes, no global analyses to profile staphylococcal host factor binding have so far been performed. Therefore, we explored the possibility to profile the binding of <b>human</b> <b>serum</b> <b>proteins</b> to S. aureus cells by "surface shaving" with trypsin and subsequent MS analysis of liberated peptides. This resulted {{in the identification of}} several components of the complement system, the platelet factor 4 and the isoform 1 of the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H 4 on the staphylococcal cell surface.
