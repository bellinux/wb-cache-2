5|$|Ryu has {{the ability}} to jump on and off ladders and walls, and by using the {{directional}} pad, he can climb up or down ladders. Ryu can spring off walls by holding the directional pad in the opposite direction he is facing and pressing the <b>jump</b> <b>button.</b> He cannot attack while on walls or ladders. Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between walls and columns by holding down the <b>jump</b> <b>button</b> and alternating between left and right on the directional pad. Ryu can also vertically climb a single wall by springing off it and then quickly pressing the directional pad back towards the wall.|$|E
5|$|Slalom was {{originally}} released in 1986 in the arcades {{as part of}} the Nintendo VS. System and was titled Vs. Slalom. This release featured an upright cabinet, a joystick, one <b>jump</b> <b>button,</b> monaural sound, and standard raster graphics. There was also an optional controller upgrade that featured two physical ski poles and shortened skis that the player could stand on and use to control the skier onscreen. The NES version was released by Nintendo in North America in March1987 and in Europe on October15, 1987. Slalom was Rare's first video game developed as a new company. It was also the Stamper brothers' first video game console release.|$|E
5|$|Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom is a side-scrolling {{platform}} game {{in which}} the player controls the player character Ryu Hayabusa as he investigates the events behind Irene Lew's death. In the game, Ryu can jump, hang, and climb up and down walls with the control pad; pressing the <b>jump</b> <b>button</b> while holding the control pad the direction {{away from the wall}} causes Ryu to spring off the wall. Ryu is also able to attack enemies with secondary weapons while on a wall by pressing the attack button. A new feature introduced in Ninja GaidenIII is the ability for Ryu to hang overhead from pipes or ivy; he can swing up on top or drop from them, and as with walls, he can only attack enemies while hanging with secondary weapons.|$|E
50|$|As in most beat 'em ups, a desperation {{attack is}} {{performed}} by pressing both {{the attack and}} <b>jump</b> <b>buttons</b> simultaneously. This knocks out most enemies on the screen, but the player loses {{a little bit of}} health every time he uses it.|$|R
50|$|The {{game for}} which he is best known, Alex Kidd in Miracle World, was {{released}} in 1986 and built into later versions of the Master System and the Master System II model, replacing the Snail Maze/Safari Hunt/Hang-On games of the first model. This integrated SMSII version reversed the attack and <b>jump</b> <b>buttons</b> from the earlier cartridge version to conform to that of other popular action games of the day.|$|R
50|$|Midnight Resistance {{features}} play {{mechanics and}} controls {{similar to that}} of the Contra series, and can be played by up to two players simultaneously (except Sega Mega Drive/Genesis). The main distinguishing feature is the inclusion of a rotatable joystick similar to the one used in Ikari Warriors, in addition to the traditional set of shoot and <b>jump</b> <b>buttons,</b> allowing the player to adjust his character's aim in one of eight directions by rotating the joystick clockwise or counter-clockwise. This allows the player to keep their aim in one direction while moving in another, even while crawling or jumping.|$|R
5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} in the Tony Hawk's series, Underground {{is centered on}} skateboarding {{in a series of}} levels. The player performs tricks via combinations of analog stick and button inputs. For example, the player initiates an ollie (a jump trick) by holding and releasing the <b>jump</b> <b>button.</b> During an ollie, the player may change the position of the analog stick and press one of two buttons to perform either a flip trick (such as an impossible or kickflip) or a grab trick (such as a benihana or nosegrab). The player can grind on certain edges and rails; different tricks may be performed during a grind based on the position of the analog stick. On quarter pipes, the player may execute lip tricks. While skating on flat surfaces, the player may manual in multiple ways via button combinations. Miscellaneous tricks include acid drops and wall-rides.|$|E
5|$|Some of Mighty Jill Offs {{gameplay}} is {{borrowed from}} the 1986 arcade game Mighty Bomb Jack as a tribute. Players control Jill in only three ways: moving, jumping, and slowly descending. In the air, players may cause Jill to slowly descend by rapidly pushing the <b>jump</b> <b>button</b> while pointing in the direction that they want her to go. Players can switch direction while they do this. There are three types of obstacles: spikes, fire, and spiders; the latter can move to attack Jill when she comes close. Coming into contact with these obstacles kills Jill instantly, forcing her {{to start at the}} most recent checkpointâ€”typically located at a change in room. There is only one level in the game, but with several rooms in it. The screen scrolls vertically with Jill as she ascends up the tower. Each room transition is demonstrated by a change in the room's background colour. Jill has infinite lives, allowing players to play as long as they like without having to start the game over.|$|E
500|$|The {{context-sensitive}} attacks received {{praise and}} criticism. Antista said, [...] " [...] fans will {{be thankful for}} is the triumphant return of the contextual attacks", but added that the control limitations were the [...] "only real problem", as {{the sensitivity of the}} cursor button can result in a failed combo, [...] "And the <b>jump</b> <b>button</b> sends you forward in the direction you're facing automatically." [...] Buchanan noted that the contextual attacks [...] "can prove frustratingly tricky as you have a brief amount of time to input the commands, but the controls on most handsets are quite small".|$|E
50|$|The {{controls}} for Final Fight consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for attacking and jumping respectively. Pressing the attack button repeatedly when attacking an enemy or multiple enemies {{will cause the}} player character to perform a combo. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick {{in the opposite direction}} just before landing it. The player can also perform jump attacks. Pressing the attack and <b>jump</b> <b>buttons</b> simultaneously allows the player to perform a special attack that strikes all surrounding enemies, but will drain {{a small portion of the}} player's health.|$|R
50|$|The player must direct Professor Hector to <b>jump</b> onto <b>buttons,</b> {{that each}} {{activate}} an action for R.O.B., {{in a sequence}} {{in order to get}} R.O.B. to arrange the colored discs in a certain order on the five pedestals around R.O.B.|$|R
50|$|The game is {{controlled}} with two attack buttons (strong and weak) and the directional pad for moving left, right, crouching, and <b>jumping.</b> Shoulder <b>buttons</b> {{can also be}} used to change between foreground and background and can be used to activate the character's special attack.|$|R
2500|$|Klonoa: Empire of Dreams {{works like}} a typical 2D sidescroller with the player moving Klonoa left or right on a {{scrolling}} screen while defeating enemies using his [...] "wind bullet", a special ring that can shoot a small gust of wind forward and draw an enemy in, allowing Klonoa to lift them over his head. [...] From this position, he can either throw them straight forward like a projectile, taking out any enemy they hit, or he can perform a double-jump, allowing him to reach places he couldn't normally. [...] In addition to enemies, Klonoa can also pick up large square blocks and place them wherever the player chooses. [...] By holding the <b>jump</b> <b>button</b> after Klonoa has left the ground, Klonoa flaps his ears and can float in mid-air for a short duration, which also somewhat increases his jumping height.|$|E
2500|$|A {{platform}} game (or platformer) is a [...] type {{of video}} game, and subgenre of action game. It involves guiding a player character or avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to traverse their environment. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the <b>jump</b> <b>button,</b> {{but now there}} are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen. Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well, such as climbing, swinging from vines or extendable arms, as in Ristar or Bionic Commando, or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in Alpha Waves. These mechanics, even {{in the context of}} other genres, are commonly called platforming, a verbification of platform. Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in The Legend of Zelda series, fall outside of the genre.|$|E
50|$|The <b>jump</b> <b>button</b> {{has been}} changed from B to Up in the Japanese release.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of mobile phone is swift and abundant. This research aims at converting a cycling website to a mobile phone interface and exploring the simplification design principles, which are examined by LUI (Logical User Interface), PUI (Physical User Interface), and GUI (Graphic User Interface) three facets. The research sample is recruited from bike club and design school and assigned to web-surfing groups, and cycling groups. Data show research participants are congruent in high satisfaction to the converted APP web design over the conventional one, including {{the direction and}} connection, the navigation on panorama picture, and <b>jump</b> <b>buttons.</b> However, design students also suggest the color layout of the web can be improved, and the graphic design can be more attractive...|$|R
50|$|The {{player can}} {{conserve}} ammo by attacking an enemy at close range, causing he/she {{to use a}} melee attack instead of firing a weapon. When an enemy is defeated with a close-range attack, the amount of points awarded will be doubled. The player can also attack the enemy with a jumping attack depending on the timing. The player can also throw an explosive (which serves as the character's sub-weapon) by pressing the shoot and <b>jump</b> <b>buttons</b> simultaneously while standing or crouching. The type of explosive used by the player varies depending on the character. The player can use explosives to take down several enemies in a fixed range, allowing players to accumulate more points than by killing them with simple gunfire.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the punch, kick, and <b>jump</b> <b>buttons,</b> the player now has a guard button for blocking attacks. If the player times the guard button right, their character can not only defend against an enemy's punch, they can also put certain enemies in an arm grab, leaving the enemy vulnerable to successive attacks. The arm grab only works on Williams, Roper, Steve, Jackson and the Chen brothers. There's also a [...] "Dragon Power" [...] gauge under the life gauge, which the player can fill by holding down L or R buttons. While the gauge is filling up, the player can perform special attacks which vary {{depending on how much}} power the player has accumulated, which includes a flying hurricane kick. If the power gauge is completely filled, then the player's regular attacks will gain extra strength for a limited period.|$|R
50|$|The {{player can}} {{jump in the}} {{opposite}} direction immediately upon landing, without releasing the <b>jump</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{collection}} received mostly positive reviews. The {{collection was}} slightly criticized for lacking somewhat in the extras department, and the GameCube version was criticized slightly more for {{not including the}} remixed audio for Mega Man 1-6. More controversial was {{the change in the}} GameCube edition's controls, which saw its fire and <b>jumping</b> <b>buttons</b> reversed from their original Nintendo Entertainment System configuration with no option to arrange them back making level progression much trickier as a result. Conversely, the exclusive extra in the PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions were both praised, with the GameCube version's interview being favored. The Xbox version rated slightly better than the other two versions, because of its added exclusive content as well as the exclusive bonuses from the PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions. However, it was given a score of 8.0 (versus 8.5 for the other two versions) from IGN for arriving late, in addition to occasional graphical glitches depending on screen settings, which become more apparent when played on an Xbox 360.|$|R

50|$|Kirby's basic {{abilities}} include running, jumping, flight, swimming, and inhaling. Flight involves inhaling air (Up button), {{followed with}} the press of the <b>jump</b> <b>button</b> which will make Kirby fly. By continuously pushing the <b>jump</b> <b>button,</b> Kirby can reach any height (unless something prevents him from reaching that height). At any time when Kirby has inhaled air, he can exhale by either landing {{on the ground or}} you can also release it yourself. When the air is released, Kirby will exhale a puff of air, which can be used to damage enemies or destroy blocks.|$|E
5000|$|The {{controls}} of Strider consist of an eight-way joystick and two action buttons for attacking and jumping. The player controls the protagonist Strider Hiryu, whose main weapon is a tonfa-like plasma sword known as [...] "Cypher". He can perform numerous acrobatic feats {{depending on the}} joystick/button combination used. Pressing the <b>jump</b> <b>button</b> while Hiryu is standing still will cause him to do a regular vertical jump, while pressing the <b>jump</b> <b>button</b> while pushing the joystick left or right will enable him to do a cartwheel jump. Hiryu can also slide under or through certain obstacles and enemies by first crouching down and then pressing the <b>jump</b> <b>button.</b> As well as his sliding move, both jumps {{can also be used}} to destroy weaker opponents. Hiryu is able to latch onto certain platforms, and climb across walls and ceilings using a metallic hook. While running down a sloped surface, Hiryu can gain enough momentum to allow him to do a longer cartwheel jump than usual.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the standard punch, kick, and <b>jump</b> <b>buttons</b> and a designated run button, the player now has an evade button for dodging attacks. If the player times their evasion right so as to perfectly dodge an enemy attack, they will [...] "Gleam" [...] by briefly glowing red, during which time their attacks will be more powerful. The player can collect life-replenishing sodas, money to buy items from shops, and special mixtapes that can be equipped from a pause menu. Two different tapes can be equipped at once: one to grant the brothers a powerful attack that consumes a separate energy meter, and one to alter their statistics and grant special effects (such as {{making it easier to}} stun enemies or healing HP with every connecting blow). By collecting multiple copies of a tape, its effect gradually increases until it reaches a maximum capacity. Each tape's maximum capacity can be increased further by visiting a [...] "Tapesmith" [...] and paying him Mythril, which is obtained from defeated bosses.|$|R

50|$|You {{take control}} of a little car that must avoid the other cars, as {{they will try to}} take you out of the road. You must be careful with the slopes too, as they might be {{dangerous}} at a high speed. Additionally, the car can jump to avoid the cars and to finish the course, as the finish is after a roadless zone. If you manage to time your <b>jump,</b> press <b>button</b> two to free the parachute and land safely. After you finish the four courses, the game will start again with increased difficulty.|$|R
