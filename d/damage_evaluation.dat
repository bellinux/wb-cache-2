40|$|Abstract. The {{reliability}} of flood loss evaluation {{plays an important}} role on the flood management decision-making. The uncertainties of <b>damage</b> <b>evaluation</b> are mainly due to the absence of hazard, vulnerability and economic data. The methodology used to combine data is another source of uncertainty. In order to study the sensitivity of <b>damage</b> <b>evaluation,</b> this paper compares: (a) partial and final results of a complex 1 D/ 2 D hydraulic model in an urban area; (b) four different vulnerability assessment methods; and (c) three different GIS assumptions when coupling hazard with vulnerability. We make sensitivity tests to hydraulic, vulnerability and the coupling methodology uncertainties. The city of Holtzheim, situated within the low valley of the Bruche River, of eastern France, is taken as the study case. Direct damages to buildings and contents are calculated, and indirect damages are estimated for economic activities.

40|$|The 2010 - 2011 Canterbury {{earthquake}} sequence {{provides a}} rare opportunity to study the performance of modern structures designed under well-enforced, evolving seismic code provisions and subjected to severe ground shaking. In particular, New Zealand makes widespread use of precast concrete seismic systems, including those that are designed to respond identically to cast-in-place concrete structures (emulative systems) and, in more recent years, those that take advantage of the unique jointed properties of precast construction. New Zealand building construction also makes extensive use of precast elements for gravity systems, floor systems, stairs, and cladding. Although not always classified as part of the primary seismic force-resisting system, these "secondary" elements must undergo the compatible displacements imposed in the earthquake. <b>Damage</b> <b>evaluations</b> for several of these structures subjected to strong shaking provide the ability to examine the differences in seismic performance for systems of distinct design intent and standards, including the performance of secondary elements...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFatigue life {{estimation}} or fatigue <b>damage</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{of mechanical}} components under a multiaxial {{state of stress}} time-history has {{an important role in}} virtual design phases, but this evaluation is a real problem to resolve, because this goal is not reached by classical fatigue criteria. In this context, the equivalent uniaxial stress has been chosen as the approach useful for this purpose by combining it with a strength curve for the material (i. e. S-N curve) and <b>damage</b> <b>evaluation</b> (Damaged Stress Model (DMS) and Miner's rule). So the authors have taken equivalent stresses based on a multiaxial criterion that {{can be used as a}} uniaxial stress time history for the application of <b>damage</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods to predict the fatigue life, under multiaxial random loading. The cycles were counted with the Rain Flow algorithm, using equivalent stress as a variable counting. In the case of "asymmetric" histories, the algorithm of transformation of the stress history (because of its global expected value different from zero) is required. In the case of 10 HNAP steel, stress amplitude transformation according to the Goodman relationship gives good results. The proposed algorithm was verified during fatigue tests of cruciform specimens made of 10 HNAP steel, subjected to biaxial non-proportional random tension-compression...|$|E

30|$|The SWIFT TSUNAMI {{system has}} been {{developed}} for tsunami disaster mitigation, especially for great tsunamis. We discuss the forecast results {{from the viewpoint of}} users. Users should consider the worst-case scenario from the forecasts for early warning and remember that the forecast may underestimate the tsunami size in cases of tsunami earthquakes and great-earthquake-induced seafloor failures. Because we need 30  min from the occurrence of the earthquake to obtain the SWIFT tsunami forecast, we cannot use the estimated results for the forecast at coasts {{in the vicinity of the}} epicenter within a 30 -min arrival time (Figs.  8, 9). Unfortunately, however, near-field coasts with a short arrival time experience the highest wave in many tsunami events. In addition, seismic waveform analysis and obtaining a reliable CMT solution require substantial time of 10 – 20  min even though the tsunami calculation time may be reduced. Users should recognize whether their target regions can receive a reliable forecast before or just after a significant earthquake occurrence. The forecast results at the nearest coasts may not be used before the disaster, but will be useful for post-disaster <b>damage</b> <b>evaluations</b> and remediation activities.|$|R
40|$|UV {{radiations}} are principal {{causes of}} skin cancer and aging. Suntan creams were developed to protect epidermis and derma layers against photodegradation and photooxidation. The addition of antioxidant plant extracts (i. e. essential oil) to sunscreens is habitually performed, to increase their UV protective effects and to contrast pro-radical and cytotoxic compounds present in these solutions. According to these observations, in the present work, the alteration of chemical composition and bioactive properties of Lavandula angustifolia Miller essential oil, exposed to UV light, was investigated. UV induced a significant deterioration of lavender oil biochemical profile. Moreover, the antioxidant activity of this solution, in in vitro tests and directly on B 16 -F 10 melanoma cells, greatly decreased after UV treatment. Our results also showed that essential oil was shielded from UV stress by propolis addition. Even after UV treatment, bee glue highly protected lavender oil secondary metabolites from degradation and also preserved their antiradical properties, both in in vitro antioxidant assays and in cell oxidative <b>damage</b> <b>evaluations.</b> This research proposed propolis as highly efficient UV protective and antiradical additive for sunscreens, cosmetics and alimentary or pharmaceutical products containing plant extracts...|$|R
