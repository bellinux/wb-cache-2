40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{availability}} of Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors in a variety of everyday devices, GPS trace data are becoming increasingly abundant. One potential use of this wealth of data is to infer and update the geometry and connectivity of <b>road</b> <b>maps</b> through the use of what are known as map generation or map inference algorithms. These algorithms offer a tremendous advantage when no existing <b>road</b> <b>map</b> data are present. Instead of the expense of a complete road survey, GPS trace data can be used to generate entirely new sections of the <b>road</b> <b>map</b> {{at a fraction of the}} cost. In cases of existing <b>maps,</b> <b>road</b> <b>map</b> inference may not only help to increase the accuracy of available <b>road</b> <b>maps</b> but may also help to detect new road construction and to make dynamic adaptions to road closures—useful features for in-car navigation with digital <b>road</b> <b>maps.</b> In past research, proposed algorithms had been evaluated qualitatively with little or no comparison with prior work. This lack of quantitative and comparative evaluation is addressed in thi...|$|R
