50|$|The Act {{contains}} {{detailed provisions}} regarding statements of account. The Regulations prescribe {{the form and}} content of statements {{in the case of}} small agreements. Credit providers must deliver to consumers periodic statements of account, usually once a month (but once every two months for <b>instalment</b> <b>sale</b> agreements).|$|E
50|$|The court may, in its discretion, {{refuse to}} take account of {{periodical}} payments that a judgment debtor has undertaken to make in terms of <b>instalment</b> <b>sale</b> transactions for the purchase of goods not exempted from attachment, or goods which, in the opinion of the court, cannot be regarded as household requirements.|$|E
50|$|A credit {{provider}} is {{the party}} who supplies goods or services (in terms of an <b>instalment</b> <b>sale</b> agreement, for example), or who pays money (in terms, for example, of a secured or unsecured money loan, overdraft facility, pawn transaction or mortgage loan). The credit provider is often {{also referred to as}} “the creditor,” in particular when steps are taken to recover amounts due from the consumer.|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on motor vehicle retail {{instalment}} contracts {{and their impact on}} consumer credit development, the abuses they have engendered, and the pattern of regulation which has grown around them. The article first addresses the history of the market and then examines the New York Motor Vehicle Retail <b>Instalment</b> <b>Sales</b> Act, urging legislative reform...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to present various types of {{consumer}} credits provided by sales finance companies offering <b>instalment</b> <b>sales,</b> and to compare them with loans granted by banks. Special {{attention is paid to}} the companies GE Money Multiservis, CETELEM ČR, a. s., Home Credit, a. s., ESSOX, s. r. o., and COFIDIS, s. r. o., focusing on their instalment selling terms and conditions. The banks institutions are represented by purpose and non-purpose loans offered by Česká spořitelna, a. s., Komerční banka, a. s., and Poštovní spořitelna...|$|R
50|$|Section 93 amends the Charging Orders Act 1979 {{to enable}} {{charging}} orders {{to be made}} even though the debtor is not in arrears of an order for payment of the debt by <b>instalments.</b> However, <b>sale</b> can only be ordered if instalments are missed. Section 94 gives the Lord Chancellor {{the power to make}} regulations setting minimum limits on the value of debts where these provisions can be used to prevent their being invoked unfairly or vexatiously.|$|R
50|$|In futuro debts—that is to say, debts which become {{due and payable}} in the future, {{including}} mortgage {{bonds and}} assets subject to credit agreements—are excluded from the administration order. This means that the court will exclude {{a certain amount of}} money from the weekly or monthly payments made to the administrator for the purpose of allowing the debtor to make periodical payments in terms of a credit <b>instalment</b> <b>sale</b> agreement or existing maintenance or mortgage-bond obligations.|$|E
50|$|A hire {{purchase}} agreement, {{also known as}} an <b>instalment</b> <b>sale,</b> allows the purchase {{price to be paid}} in instalments after delivery of the hired property. Ownership remains with the seller until the hirer has paid the last hire instalment. The seller’s tacit hypothec is triggered by the sequestration of the hirer. The seller has a secured claim to the outstanding instalments due in terms of the {{hire purchase}} agreement. The seller’s hypothec under a hire purchase agreement secures the seller’s claim to outstanding instalments, so that the seller has a preferential claim.|$|E
50|$|Part V {{contains}} several provisions {{relating to}} the cancellation of a regulated agreement and the withdrawal from a prospective regulated agreement. These {{are similar to those}} found in the Hire-Purchase Act 1965, but cover all consumer credit and consumer hire agreements rather than the hire-purchase and <b>instalment</b> <b>sale</b> agreements previously covered. The withdrawal from a prospective agreement is found primarily at common law; a party may withdraw from a prospective agreement at any point before it becomes a contract without obligations. He can withdraw the prospective agreement by notice to the other party, with the Act allowing the creditor to use credit brokers as agents for this purpose.|$|E
40|$|The {{equitable}} {{principle of}} relief from penalties and forfeitures {{is so far}} elementary as almost to defy analysis. Many, perhaps most, of the judicial explanations of the principle have based it upon interpretation or construction, appealing to the doctrine that equity regards intent rather than form. Yet a logical application of this doctrine would lead to results very different from those which have actually been arrived at in the decisions. Thus, a stipulation in a mortgage that the mortgagor waives his equity of redemption can hardly be interpreted as meaning {{that he does not}} waive it, yet all such stipulations are ignored and redemption granted, nevertheless. Again, a penalty for breach of contract cannot be saved by the most solemn declaration that it is intended as liquidated damages. It must be conceded that many cases have actually been, decided on the interpretation theory, producing such enormities as Iowa Land Co. v. Mickel, 41 Ia. 402 (sale of land, $ 150 out of $ 600 paid, $ 4000 in improvements, second instalment of $ 150 one day late due to a misunderstanding; held forfeited), and Doctornan v. Schroeder, 114 Atl. 810 (N. J., 1921; sale of land, $ 1000 paid, last instalment of $ 1000 thirty minutes late; held forfeited). But such cases represent the minority view, and one applicable only to <b>instalment</b> <b>sales,</b> no court pursuing this course in mortgage or liquidated damage cases...|$|R
50|$|The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit (commonly {{known as}} Martin Chuzzlewit) {{is a novel}} by Charles Dickens, {{considered}} {{the last of his}} picaresque novels. It was originally serialised between 1842 and 1844. Dickens thought it to be his best work, but it was one of his least popular novels. Like nearly all of Dickens' novels, Martin Chuzzlewit was released to the public in monthly <b>instalments.</b> Early <b>sales</b> of the monthly parts were disappointing, compared to previous works, so Dickens changed the plot to send the title character to America. This allowed the author to portray the United States (which he had visited in 1842) satirically as a near wilderness with pockets of civilisation filled with deceptive and self-promoting hucksters.|$|R
60|$|In {{general the}} Commission decides by a {{majority}} vote, except in certain specific cases where unanimity is required, of which the most important are the cancellation of German indebtedness, long postponement of the <b>instalments,</b> and the <b>sale</b> of German bonds of indebtedness. The Commission is endowed with full executive authority {{to carry out its}} decisions. It may set up an executive staff and delegate authority to its officers. The Commission and its staff are to enjoy diplomatic privileges, and its salaries are to be paid by Germany, who will, however, have no voice in fixing them, If the Commission is to discharge adequately its numerous functions, it will be necessary for it to establish a vast polyglot bureaucratic organization, with a staff of hundreds. To this organization, the headquarters of which will be in Paris, the economic destiny of Central Europe is to be entrusted.|$|R
5000|$|The {{courts have}} long held {{equitable}} jurisdiction {{to set aside}} [...] "harsh and unconscionable bargains", but prior to the Consumer Credit Act this was mainly used in cases where uninformed tradespeople have been selling goods at a loss, and was rarely used in the 20th century. The Moneylenders Act 1900 allowed the court to re-open a moneylending transaction if there was evidence that interest rates were [...] "harsh and unconscionable or otherwise such that a court of equity would give relief", unless the moneylender could justify the rates. It was rarely used {{in the field of}} consumer credit because it was limited to those sorts of consumer transactions covered by the Moneylenders Act, and did not cover hire-purchase agreements or <b>instalment</b> <b>sale</b> agreements or loan transactions from people who were not moneylenders, such as banks.|$|E
40|$|We {{will attempt}} to answer the vexing {{question}} that arises {{in the context of}} the consumer’s remedies where he has been sold defective goods after 31 March 2011 (the date on which the CPA came into general effective operation) under an instalment agreement governed by the NCA. We will therefore also focus on the nature of an <b>instalment</b> <b>sale</b> agreement, and the rights and obligations of all the parties involved in the sale of the vehicle and the eventual conclusion of an instalment agreement in terms of the NCA. Further, we will examine the interplay, if any, between those rights and obligations in terms of the NCA in the case of an instalment agreement, and the rights and obligations of a supplier and a consumer under the CPA as regards the issue of defective goods.

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the analysis of methods of fixed assets acquisition, with a focus on leasing. Its aim is to evaluate the acquisition of fixed assets through leasing in comparison with alternative forms in the limited liability company Servistrade s. r. o. in terms of the financial resource provider. The theoretical part describes fixed assets, their classification, leasing, alternative forms of property acquisition and comparison thereof. The practical part begins with the characteristics of Servistrade s. r. o. The analysis is made upon the actual data submitted by the company. For the fixed assets acquisition, the company may provide leasing, <b>instalment</b> <b>sale</b> or bank loan. Evaluation of the best variant of assets acquisition (from the Servistrade provider?s viewpoint) was done in terms of cash flow, income tax and VAT. The evaluation was also conducted {{from the perspective of the}} tenant MMC Pardubice s. r. o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between disaggregated credit extension and financial distress in South Africa. Of particular interest is to isolate the components of disaggregated credit extension that show a strong relationship with the measure of financial distress. The empirical results reveal that aggregate total domestic credit extension is robustly positively correlated with the composite indicator of financial distress, {{while there is a}} mixed relationship between the components of disaggregated credit extension and the composite indicator of financial distress. In particular, the study finds that total domestic credit extension, <b>instalment</b> <b>sale</b> credit, loans and advances to households, investments and total loans and advances are highly correlated with the composite indicator of financial distress. Therefore,the study conjures that these components could be aggregated into a single measure of credit extension that could be usedfor financial stability purposes in South Africa. Keywords.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in attempt to investigate the viability of the <b>INSTALMENT</b> <b>SALE</b> AGREEMENTS concept in the South African residential property market. The study aimed to answer the pressing question on whether the concept of an Instalment Sales Agreement would stand ground as a viable alternative/option for both the purchaser as well as the credit provider for properties ranged above the governmental subsidy schemes and programmes and below R 500 000 niche market of Gauteng. This particular research aimed to investigate the core challenges as experienced and viewed by the main stakeholders in the process of furnishing and/or the acquisition of residential property whilst investigating and addressing adequate solutions beneficial to the respective parties as viewed and interpreted from their respective vantage points. The main concerns identified include primarily whether developers would find it feasible to develop and sell the said properties on the basis of an Instalment Sales Agreement. Secondarily whether prospective clients will be willing and able to purchase and secure residential property on the basis of an Instalment Sales Agreement as an viable alternative sales model whilst, accepting the concept as a feasible and reasonable alternative to conventional and traditional property purchasing and acquisition methods on offer in order to achieve property ownership as opposed to possibly not being successful nor able to qualify to secure a home loans or government subsidy.
