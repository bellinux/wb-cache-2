5|$|Cagney's {{frequent}} co-star, Pat O'Brien, {{appeared with}} him on the British chat show Parkinson in the early 1980s and they both made a surprise appearance at the Queen Mother's command birthday performance at the London Palladium in 1980. His appearance on stage prompted the Queen Mother to rise to <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> the only time she did so during the whole show, and she later broke protocol to go backstage to speak with Cagney directly.|$|E
5|$|The female {{relies on}} her hind feet for digging. She may {{accumulate}} so much sand and mud on <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> that her mobility is reduced, making her vulnerable to predators. To lighten her labors, she lubricates {{the area with}} her bladder water. Once the nest is complete, the female deposits into the hole. The freshly laid eggs are white, elliptical, porous, and flexible. From start to finish, the female's work may take fourhours. Sometimes she remains on land overnight afterwards, before returning to her home water.|$|E
50|$|Azarenka {{returned}} from <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> injury at the Indian Wells Masters, but {{she lost her}} first match to Lauren Davis, marking her earliest ever exit from Indian Wells. A recurrence of <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> injury at Indian Wells later forced her withdrawal from Miami {{for the second consecutive}} year.|$|R
50|$|In early 2012, Jessica had {{a couple}} of minor {{accidents}} - breaking her ankle and then in a separate incident, cutting <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> on glass at a wedding, which led to nerve damage in <b>her</b> <b>foot.</b> This led to Jessica being out of action from the catwalk for a few months.|$|R

5|$|Blood {{and urine}} samples {{indicated}} {{that she had}} taken the anti-psychotic drug haloperidol, and several days earlier had used cannabis. There were no marks on her body suggestive of a struggle. The firearms officer who first saw her said <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> and hands were clean, her fingernails manicured and not broken, and her fingertips free of blood, dirt or powder. There was no trace of lead dust. The rifle magazine would have been loaded at least twice during the killings; this would usually leave lubricant and material from the bullets on the hands. A scenes-of-crimes officer, DC Hammersley, said there were bloodstains {{on the back of}} her right hand, but that otherwise her hands were clean.|$|E
5|$|During the TGS afterparty, new {{cast member}} Danny Baker (Cheyenne Jackson) admits to his boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), {{that he has}} been having an office romance but will not {{disclose}} the woman's name. While in attendance at a New York Knicks game, Jack asks more about the woman Danny is seeing and Danny reveals details, such as she has never let a man see <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> This results in Jack's realization that the woman is the show's head writer, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), and he is displeased.|$|E
5|$|For the {{supporting}} roles, Zarina Wahab was cast as Suhasini Chauhan, Vijay's mother; a role originally played by Rohini Hattangadi. Wahab {{agreed to do}} the film, due to her close association with producer, Johar. For the role of Shiksha Chauhan, newcomer Kanika Tiwri was auditioned and cast among 6500 girls. In order to feature an item number in the film, producer Johar wanted to sign Kareena Kapoor, who refused the offer and Katrina Kaif was eventually contracted. Filming for the song was demanding on Kaif, as she ended up with cuts and blisters on <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> due to the long, stretched-out schedules.|$|E

5000|$|The script had to {{be revised}} when Claudia Christian broke <b>her</b> <b>foot.</b> The scene was added in which her character, Susan Ivanova, was trying to {{negotiate}} a peace between two warring factions of Drazi when the Drazi group exploded into a brawl, and she injures <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> when the Drazi pile on top of her.|$|R
5|$|Oviri {{has long}} blonde or grey hair {{reaching}} to her knees. Her head and eyes are disproportionately large, she has adolescent breasts, while the aperture {{at the back}} of her head resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a wolf cub to her hip, a symbol of her indifference and wild power. It is not clear whether Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eug√®ne Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is at <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.|$|E
5|$|Sabina got to <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> whereupon a policewoman {{attempted}} {{to persuade her}} {{to stay on the}} ground and receive further medical attention. Sabina instead struck the officer and crossed the central reservation again, running into traffic {{on the other side of}} the motorway. Emergency workers and several members of the public caught up with her, restrained her and carried her to a waiting ambulance, at which point she was sedated. Ursula was also taken to hospital where she stayed for weeks. Sabina appeared less deranged and more calm and relaxed in police custody.|$|E
5|$|The basic garment for all Romans, {{regardless}} of gender or wealth, was the simple sleeved tunic. The length differed by wearer: a man's reached mid-calf, but a soldier's was somewhat shorter; a woman's fell to <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> and a child's to its knees. The tunics {{of poor people}} and labouring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural, dull shades, with the length determined {{by the type of}} work they did. Finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen. A man who belonged to the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes (clavi) woven vertically into the fabric: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer's status. Other garments could be layered over the tunic.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} team {{then moved to}} Harlem to film a chase scene set during a procession before moving to Coney Island, where {{the cast and crew}} underwent severely cold weather conditions. The location was used to film a scene in which Angel questions a man Izzy (George Buck) about the whereabouts of Johnny Favorite, while Izzy's wife Bo (Judith Drake) stands waist deep in the ocean. The original actress who was cast as Bo was injured when she was knocked off <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> by a wave while delivering her first line. The actress refused to reshoot the scene, which led to her being replaced by her stand-in, Drake, whom Parker found to be a better actress for the role.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no blood}} on <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> or other debris, {{such as the}} sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on her hands and {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The blood on her nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, {{it was hard to see}} how she could have carried the cartridges.|$|E
5|$|Brady and Hindley {{visited a}} {{fairground}} on 26 December 1964, {{in search of}} another victim, and noticed 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey standing beside one of the rides. When {{it became apparent that}} she was on her own, they approached her and deliberately dropped some of the shopping they were carrying close to her, before asking for the girl's help to carry some of the packages to their car, and then to their home. Once inside the house Downey was undressed, gagged and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string. Hindley maintained that she went to fill a bath for the child and found the girl dead (presumably killed by Brady) when she returned. In Chris Cowley's book Face to Face with Evil: Conversations with Ian Brady, Brady states that it was Hindley who killed Downey. The following morning Brady and Hindley drove with Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor, where she was buried, naked with her clothes at <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> in a shallow grave.|$|E

5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E
5|$|Ivy's {{alternate}} character {{designs in}} the games are a contrast to her primary designs, with the secondary from Soulcalibur to Soulcalibur III consisting of countess attire of either blue or red pants, vest, and jacket, with white boots covering <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> and her hair combed back. In Soulcalibur II, a tertiary alternate design was added consisting of a red leotard and gloves with gold trimming, with red stockings on her legs; in addition, a fourth design resembling her appearance {{at the conclusion of}} Soulcalibur was considered, incorporating a cloak and the symbol of caduceus on the front of her leotard cupping her breasts, but was unused. In Soulcalibur III, a long, rose-themed dress with hat and veil was used as a tertiary alternate, one of several considered designs. For Soulcalibur IV, a similarly themed black dress was used as her sole alternate design for the game.|$|E
5|$|JIVE Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{for the song}} to be directed by Billie Woodruff. It was produced under Geneva Films, while the choreography was created by Wade Robson. The narrative of the video shows Spears dreaming as she sleeps in her room. As the dream begins, Spears is shown in a blue and silver futuristic room with several different levels, where she sings and walks around, and puts <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> on the wall while wearing a shiny silver outfit. MTV news reporter Ellen Thompson considered it the sexiest moment of the music video. As the video continues, Spears is seen {{on top of the}} apartment building she lives in, performing a dance segment in a red top and black skirt with a few backup dancers. The following scenes shows the singer wearing white clothes and singing in the room in which she is sleeping, while her love interest comes into her room to see her. Together, they start a pillow fight that shortly ends after Spears is shown again in her room still sleeping, however, now with a smile upon her face. A longer dance segment intercalates with all the scenes during the whole video.|$|E

5|$|Knopf {{decided to}} produce The Big Pond in New York and {{appointed}} Hepburn the understudy to the leading lady. A week before opening, the lead was fired {{and replaced with}} Hepburn, which gave her a starring role only four weeks into her theatre career. On opening night, she turned up late, mixed her lines, tripped over <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> and spoke too quickly to be comprehensible. She was immediately fired, and the original leading lady rehired. Undeterred, Hepburn joined forces with the producer Arthur Hopkins and accepted {{the role of a}} schoolgirl in These Days. Her Broadway debut came on November 12, 1928, at the Cort Theatre, but reviews for the show were poor and it closed after eight nights. Hopkins promptly hired Hepburn as the lead understudy in Philip Barry's play Holiday. In early December, after only two weeks, she quit to marry Ludlow Ogden Smith, a college acquaintance. She planned to leave the theatre behind, but began to miss the work and quickly resumed the understudy role in Holiday, which she held for six months.|$|E
5|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the {{injuries}} had occurred from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} shots of several skyscrapers in New York, which are {{followed}} by scenes of the band performing in a warehouse that has {{been converted into a}} stage (similar to Vino's bar which is where the band used to regularly perform before they became popular). The crowd at the concert is seen singing along with the band. The video continually cuts the singer walking through Brooklyn in a dark dress and makeup. She walks through a train station, streets and the Brooklyn Bridge. During the bridge of the song, Lee runs through the Brooklyn Bridge and jumps on the other side, landing on <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> At the end of the video, the band meet up and walk to the beach where they walk into the sea. The final shot shows the band walking in the sea as the video fades out.|$|E
