5|$|Another {{major theme}} of East End {{history has been}} that of migration; both inward and outward. The area had a strong pull on the rural poor {{from other parts of}} England and {{attracted}} waves of migration from further afield: notably Huguenot refugees, who created a new <b>extramural</b> suburb in Spitalfields in the 17th century., Irish weavers, Ashkenazi Jews and, in the 20th century, Sylheti Bangladeshis.|$|E
5|$|Aston first gained {{full-time}} employment in 1970, {{working as a}} field officer at the Oxford City and County Museum in Oxfordshire. For a time living in a tent, {{he worked on the}} sites and monuments record and taught several <b>extramural</b> classes while based at the museum. This <b>extramural</b> teaching fitted closely with Aston's staunch belief that archaeology should be open to all who were interested in it. As part of this devotion to public outreach, he presented a radio series on archaeology that was broadcast on Radio Oxford. In 1974 he moved to Taunton to become the first County Archaeologist for Somerset, where he set up a new site record and oversaw the excavation of sites revealed by the construction of the M5 motorway. Again he also taught <b>extramural</b> adult education classes, this time for the University of Bristol. It was here that he developed a passion for aerial archaeology, and would often charter private planes in order to undertake aerial photography. Becoming a pioneer of landscape archaeology, along with Trevor Rowley he was responsible for coining the term in their 1974 book, Landscape Archaeology. With archaeologist James Bond he authored The Landscape of Towns (1976), in which he extended his use of landscape archaeology to urban areas. Recognising his contribution to the discipline, in 1976, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.|$|E
5|$|London {{had been}} a Roman {{settlement}} for four centuries and had become progressively more crowded inside its defensive city wall. It had also pushed outwards beyond the wall into squalid <b>extramural</b> slums such as Shoreditch, Holborn, and Southwark, and had reached far enough to include the independent City of Westminster.|$|E
5|$|Aleppo {{underwent}} major {{transformations in}} the Ayyubid period, specifically {{during the reign}} of az-Zahir Ghazi. Ayyubid architectural achievements focused on four areas: the citadel, the waterworks, fortifications, and the <b>extramural</b> developments. The total rebuilding of the city enclosure began when az-Zahir Ghazi removed the vallum of Nur ad-Din—which by then outlived its temporary need—and rebuilt the northern and northwestern walls—the most susceptible to outside attack—from Bab al-Jinan to Bab al-Nasr. He parceled out the building of the towers on this stretch of the wall to his princes and military officers; each tower was identified with a particular prince who inscribed his name into it. Later, az-Zahir Ghazi extended the eastern wall to the south and east, reflecting his desire to incorporate a dilapidated fortress, Qala'at al-Sharif, outside the city into Aleppo's enclosure. Bab Qinnasrin was completely rebuilt by an-Nasir Yusuf in 1256. This gate stands today as a masterpiece of medieval Syrian military architecture. Cumulatively, Ayyubid architecture left a lasting impression in Aleppo. The citadel was rebuilt, the water network was expanded, and streets and quarters were provided fountains and baths. In addition, dozens of shrines, mosques, madrasas, and mausoleums were built throughout the city.|$|E

25|$|In {{the session}} 1818–1819 Syme became {{assistant}} and demonstrator of the dissecting room of Robert Liston, {{who had started}} as an <b>extramural</b> teacher of anatomy in competition with Liston's old master, Dr John Barclay; in those years he held also resident appointments in the infirmary and the fever hospital, and {{spent some time in}} Paris practising dissection and operative surgery. In 1823 Liston handed over to him the whole charge of his anatomy classes, retaining his interest in the school as a pecuniary venture; the arrangement did not work smoothly, and a feud with Liston arose, which did not terminate until twenty years later, when Liston was settled in London.|$|E
25|$|Originally Roman, the Bishop's Gate was rebuilt by the Hansa {{merchants in}} 1471 in {{exchange}} for Steelyard privileges. Its final form was erected in 1735 by the City authorities and demolished in 1760. This gate often displayed the heads of criminals on spikes. London Wall (which is no longer extant in this sector) divided the ward and road into an intramural portion called Bishopsgate Within and an <b>extramural</b> portion called Bishopsgate Without. The Bishopsgate thoroughfare forms part of the A10 and the section {{to the north of}} the site of the original Gate is the start of Roman Ermine Street, also known as the 'Old North Road'.|$|E
25|$|The site {{remained}} {{prone to}} flooding, probably through the starting gates, until Claudius made improvements there; they probably included an <b>extramural</b> anti-flooding embankment. Fires in the crowded, wooden perimeter workshops and bleachers were {{a far greater}} danger. A fire of 36 AD seems to have started in a basket-maker's workshop under the stands, on the Aventine side; the emperor Tiberius compensated various small businesses there for their losses. In AD 64, during Nero's reign, fire broke out at the semi-circular end of the Circus, swept through the stands and shops, and destroyed much of the city. Games and festivals continued at the Circus, which was rebuilt over several years to the same footprint and design.|$|E

500|$|Aston did {{not believe}} that he would leave a {{significant}} legacy behind him. He commented that this was the case because Britain's archaeological community had failed to develop the work that he had done with Time Team and with <b>extramural</b> teaching, and that all the public outreach he had accomplished would die with him. He felt that there was no [...] "celebrity archaeologist" [...] to replace him, and ultimately felt that the situation in British archaeology made him [...] "angry and sad." ...|$|E
500|$|Merrifield was uneasy {{with the}} changes made to London's archaeological {{establishment}} by English Heritage during the early 1990s, strongly supporting {{the creation of the}} Standing Conference on London Archaeology to monitor English Heritage's actions.

500|$|Due to {{the hard}} times, 19-year-old Sienkiewicz {{took a job as}} tutor to the Weyher family in Płońsk. It was {{probably}} in this period that he wrote his first novel, Ofiara (Sacrifice); he is thought to have destroyed the manuscript of the never-published novel. He also worked on his first novel to be published, Na marne (In Vain). [...] He completed <b>extramural</b> secondary-school classes, and in 1866 he received his secondary-school diploma. He first tried to study medicine, then law, at the Imperial University of Warsaw, but he soon transferred to the university's Institute of Philology and History, where he acquired a thorough knowledge of literature and Old Polish Language. Little is known about this period of his life, other than that he moved out of his parents' home, tutored part-time, and lived in poverty. His situation improved somewhat in 1868 when he became tutor to the princely Woroniecki family.|$|E
500|$|Born in Oldbury, Worcestershire to {{a working-class}} family, Aston {{developed}} an early interest in archaeology, studying it as a subsidiary to geography at the University of Birmingham. In 1970, {{he began his}} career working for Oxford City and County Museum and there began his work in public outreach by running <b>extramural</b> classes in archaeology and presenting a series on the subject for Radio Oxford. In 1974, he was appointed as the first County Archaeologist for Somerset, there developing an interest in aerial archaeology and establishing a reputation as a pioneer in landscape archaeology [...] a term that he co-invented with Trevor Rowley [...] by authoring some of the earliest books on the subject. In 1978 he began lecturing at the University of Oxford and in 1979 became a tutor at the University of Bristol, supplementing these activities by working as an archaeological tour guide in Greece.|$|E
500|$|Already by {{the early}} 5th century however, Constantinople had {{expanded}} outside the Constantinian Wall, in the <b>extramural</b> area known as the Exokionion or Exakionion. The wall survived {{during much of the}} Byzantine period, even though it was replaced by the Theodosian Walls as the city's primary defence. An ambiguous passage refers to extensive damage to the city's [...] "inner wall" [...] from an earthquake on 25 September 478, which likely refers to the Constantinian wall, and Theophanes the Confessor reports renewed earthquake damage in 557. It appears that large parts survived relatively intact until the 9th century: the 11th-century historian Kedrenos records that the [...] "wall at Exokionion", likely a portion of the Constantinian wall, collapsed in an earthquake in 867. Only traces of the wall appear to have survived in later ages, although Van Millingen states that some parts survived in the region of the İsakapı until the early 19th century. The recent construction of Yenikapı Transfer Center has unearthed a section of the foundation of the wall of Constantine.|$|E
500|$|Aston saw Time Team as an {{extension}} of his work as an <b>extramural</b> tutor, telling a 2013 interviewer that it was [...] "a way of reaching 3 million people rather than 30 people in the village hall." [...] Commenting on the popularity of Time Team, and its role in exposing the British public to archaeology, in a 2010 interview Aston remarked that [...] "My motive was to get {{as many people as possible}} interested in archaeology, because we [...] all enjoy it and think it interesting. That was my personal aim... and on that basis I think it is a success." [...] Time Team encouraged wider public interest in archaeology and led to increasing numbers of students applying to study archaeological courses at British universities, while subscriptions to Current Archaeology magazine quadrupled to 18,000 in the show's first five years. In autumn 1998, Channel 4 started a Time Team fan club, which had 16,000 members within a few months, while Aston became a supporter of the Council for British Archaeology's Young Archaeologists' Club (YAC), and with Harding gave regular talks to YAC branches. Aston found himself giving up to 20 public lectures a year on the subject of Time Team, describing the public feedback as [...] "embarrassingly encouraging".|$|E
