500|$|After {{first meeting}} Lennon, Jim warned Paul {{that he would}} get him [...] "into trouble", {{although}} he later allowed The Quarrymen to rehearse in the dining room at Forthlin Road in the evenings. Jim was reluctant to let the teenage Paul go to Hamburg with The Beatles until Paul said the group would earn £15 per week each. As this was more than he earned himself, Jim finally agreed, but only after a visit from the group's then-manager, Allan Williams, who said that Jim should not worry. Jim was later present at a Beatles' concert in Manchester when fans surrounded drummer Pete Best, and ignored the rest of The Beatles. Jim criticised Best by saying, [...] "Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> attract all the attention? Why didn't you call the other lads back? I think that was very selfish of you". Bill Harry recalled that Jim was probably [...] "The Beatles' biggest fan", and was extremely proud of Paul's success. Shelagh Johnson—later to become director of The Beatles' Museum in Liverpool—said that Jim's outward show of pride embarrassed his son. Jim enlisted Michael's help when sorting through the ever-increasing sacks of fan letters that were delivered to Forthlin Road, with both composing [...] "personal" [...] responses that were supposedly from Paul. Michael would later have success on his own with the group The Scaffold.|$|E
500|$|Best's {{popularity}} with fans {{was a source}} of friction, as many female fans considered him to be the band's best-looking member. Radio Merseyside presenter Spencer Leigh wrote a book chronicling Best's firing, suggesting that the other members, McCartney in particular, were jealous. In the 31 August 1961 issue of Bill Harry's Mersey Beat music publication in Liverpool, Bob Wooler reported on the Beatles' local musical impact and singled out Best for special praise, calling the group [...] "musically authoritative and physically magnetic, example the mean, moody magnificence of drummer Pete Best – a sort of teenage Jeff Chandler." [...] During the Teenagers' Turn showcase in Manchester, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison walked on stage to applause, but when Best walked on, the girls screamed. Afterwards, attentive females surrounded Best at the stage door, while the other members were ignored after signing a few autographs. McCartney's father, Jim McCartney, was present at the time and admonished Best: [...] "Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> attract all the attention? Why didn't you call the other lads back? I think that was very selfish of you". Lennon called the accusations of jealousy a [...] "myth," [...] and claimed that Best was recruited only because they needed a drummer to go to Hamburg, saying, [...] "We were always going to dump him when we found a decent drummer." ...|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{stated that}} no {{contributor}} to the fund got any service that an ordinary constituent would not have received, and then anticipated the skeptical questions, [...] "Well, what did you use the fund for, Senator? Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have it?" [...] In response to his rhetorical question, he explained salary and office allowances for senators. He went through different ways that political expenses could be met. One way was to be rich, but the senator stated {{that he was not}} rich. Another way was to put one's spouse on the Congressional office payroll, as, he stated, his Democratic rival, Senator John Sparkman, had done. Nixon did not feel comfortable doing that himself with so many deserving stenographers in Washington needing work, though Pat Nixon was a [...] "wonderful stenographer" [...] and sometimes helped out in the office as a volunteer. At this point, the camera turned from Nixon {{for the first time to}} reveal Pat Nixon sitting alongside the desk. The senator indicated he could not continue his law practice, as some Congressmen did, due to the distance to California, and in any event he felt that practicing law while a lawmaker was a conflict of interest. Thus, he indicated, he had found that the best way to pay for political expenses not within his means was to allow contributors to do so. Nixon proffered the legal and accounting opinions as proof of his statements.|$|E

2500|$|Shot from 13 May to late October 1987, The Bear {{was filmed}} almost {{entirely in the}} Italian and Austrian areas of the Dolomites. Several {{additional}} scenes were also filmed in a Belgian Zoo in early 1988. The crew consisted of 200 individuals. Husband and wife team Tony and Heidi Lüdi served as the film's production designer and art director, respectively, alongside set decorator Bernhard Henrich. In their book, Movie Worlds: Production Design in Film, the Lüdis state that as the film's production designers, they [...] "were constantly faced with the question 'What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do?' To which we answered 'We turned the Alps into British Columbia.'" [...] Cinematographer Philippe Rousselot noted that [...] "the only thing Jean-Jacques was unable to control" [...] while filming in the Bavarian Alps [...] "was the weather: he did not manage to have the clouds take part in pre-production meetings." ...|$|E

40|$|Many years ago, when my {{hair was}} still thick, this justice spoke at a conference on state court {{judicial}} elections.

Is that how <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it? Without pausing for an ethical second, the bold justice from West Virginia said, “Money, my man, money. ” This is the realist backdrop or subtext for much of the discussion about Caperton and also White. At least some of the subtext includes an animosity to judicial elections and an attempt to defang them...|$|R
