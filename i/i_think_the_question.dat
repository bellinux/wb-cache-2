60|$|In {{reference}} to Bruce Castle school, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> set at rest most probably {{by the fact}} of there being no vacancy (it is always full) until Christmas, when Howitt's two boys and Jerrold's one go in and fill it up again. But after going carefully through the school, a question would arise in my mind whether the system--a perfectly admirable one; the only recognition of education as a broad system of moral and intellectual philosophy, that I have ever seen in practice--do not require so much preparation and progress {{in the mind of}} the boy, as that he shall have come there younger and less advanced than Willy; or at all events without that very different sort of school experience which he must have acquired at Brighton.

6000|$|Some people {{objected to}} spiritualism, table rappings, and such things, {{because they were}} undignified, because the ghosts cracked jokes or waltzed with dinner-tables. I do not share this {{objection}} in the least. I wish the spirits were more farcical than they are. That they should make more jokes and better ones, would be my suggestion. For almost all the spiritualism of our time, {{in so far as}} it is new, is solemn and sad. Some Pagan gods were lawless, and some Christian saints were a little too serious; but the spirits of modern spiritualism are both lawless and serious--a disgusting combination. The specially contemporary spirits are not only devils, they are blue devils. This is, first and last, the real value of Christmas; in so far as the mythology remains at all {{it is a kind of}} happy mythology. Personally, of course, I believe in Santa Claus; but it is the season of forgiveness, and I will forgive others for not doing so. But if there is anyone who does not comprehend the defect in our world which I am civilising, I should recommend him, for instance, to read a story by Mr. Henry James, called [...] "The Turn of the Screw." [...] It is one of the most powerful things ever written, and it is one of the things about which I doubt most whether it ought ever to have been written at all. It describes two innocent children gradually growing at once omniscient and half-witted under the influence of the foul ghosts of a groom and a governess. As I say, I doubt whether Mr. Henry James ought to have published it (no, it is not indecent, do not buy it; it is a spiritual matter), but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> so doubtful that I will give that truly great man a chance. I will approve the thing as well as admire it if he will write another tale just as powerful about two children and Santa Claus. If he will not, or cannot, then the conclusion is clear; we can deal strongly with gloomy mystery, but not with happy mystery; we are not rationalists, but diabolists.|$|E

40|$|What did {{you think}} you were doing?” Was the {{question}} posed by the conference organizers to me as the inventor and constructor of the first working Tangible Interfaces over 40 years ago. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> was intended to encourage me to talk about the underlying ideas and intentionality rather than describe an endless sequence of electronic bricks and that is what I shall do in this presentation. In the sixties the prevalent idea for a graphics interface was an analogue with sketching which was to somehow be understood by the computer as three dimensional form. I rebelled against this notion for reasons which I will explain in the presentation and instead came up with tangible physical three dimensional intelligent objects. I called these first prototypes “Intelligent Physical Modelling Systems” which is a really dumb name for an obvious concept. I am eternally grateful to Hiroshi Ishii for coining the term “Tangible User Interfaces” - the same idea but with a much smarter name. Another motivator was user involvement in the design process, and that led to the Generator (1979) project with Cedric Price for the world’s first intelligent building capable of organizing itself in response to the appetites of the users. The working model of that project is in MoMA. And the same motivation led to a self builders design kit (1980) for Walter Segal which facilitated self-builders to design their own houses. And indeed as the organizer’s question implied, the motivation and intentionality of these projects developed over the years in step with advancing technology. The speaker will attempt to articulate these changes with medical, psychological and educational examples. Much of this later work indeed stemming from the Media Lab where we are talking. Related topics such as “tangible thinking” and “intelligent teacups” will be introduced and the presentation will end with some speculations for the future. The presentation will be given against a background of images of early prototypes many of which have never been previously published...|$|E
40|$|Exploratory and {{descriptive}} study, from qualitative boarding, carried through in a Federal Public Hospital School of Recife, {{with the main}} objective to analyze ideas, beliefs and values that the pregnants have about their sexuality. The population consisted of pregnants taken care of in the Prenatal of the related institution and three pregnants that spontaneously talking about feelings related with the sexuality had constituted the sample. This study has been approval for the Ethics Committee in Research of the Health Sciences Center of the Federal University of Pernambuco. The information had been collected by means of talking in group, using a half-structuralized form where the interview not structuralized was used and the participative comment, after to elaborate the following questions: How <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of the sex? That feeling comes when I am next to my partner? How I pregnant feel pleasure? How is the sensation of the pleasure in my body? For the analysis the recorded transcription was carried through, with participants identification for the initial letter of its names, keeping secrecy of its identities. It was carried through after that, reading minute of each transcription that revealed the thematic: sexuality in the gestation and sexuality in the postpartum. When proceeding with the discussion {{it has been observed}} that the pregnants feelings related to its sexuality had been divergent in what they say respect to the frequency of the sexual relations, personal satisfaction, experience in previous gestation, partner’s invasion of limits, uterine sensations during and after coitus, to feel partner and baby during the sexual act, amongst others; and similar when it has been mentioned the fear to hurt the baby, concern with pain, man’s refuses that takes the feminine unreliability.

40|$|DISCUSSION PAPER: HARNAD: Let me {{just ask}} a {{question}} which everyone else who has been faithfully attending these sessions is surely burning to ask: If some rules you have described constitute universal constraints on all languages, yet they are not learned, nor are they somehow logically necessary a priori, how did language get that way? CHOMSKY: Well, {{it seems to me}} that would be like asking the question how does the heart get that way? I mean we don't learn to have a heart, we don't learn to have arms rather than wings. What is interesting to me is that the question should be asked. It seems to be a natural question, everyone asks it. And we should ask, why people ask it. My feeling is that if, say, the Martian that I was imagining were to look at earthlings and investigate them he would have no reason to doubt that language is as much an organ of the body as the eye or the heart or the liver. It's strictly characteristic of the species, has a highly intricate structure, developed more or less independently of experience in very specific ways, and so on. It has all the general properties of an organ of the body. Why does it seem so strange to us to think in those terms? In other words, why does it seem to us so strange to us to consider human beings in the mental aspects of their life as we consider any object of the natural world? Why is it so natural to insist on a dichotomy in accordance with which we treat the physical development of humans as belonging to the physical world, but not their mental development? My own feeling is, that what we have here is an inversion of a historical tradition that really ultimately has religious and other roots. Traditionally it was regarded as impossible, for all sorts of reasons, to study the human soul by the method of science. Now, what's interesting to me is, precisely within those tendencies in science that tried to be naturalistic, that tried to defend science against religions, barbarism and so on. Precisely in those branches of science the same curious refusal to deal with the facts persisted, so that the question you raise seems to pose an overwhelming paradox to an investigator. The problem seems overwhelming: to explain the growth of this particular mental organ, human language, through the interaction of a genetically determined system with experience, although analogous questions about other organs do not seem to arise with the same force. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> arises in the case of language exactly as it does in the case of the eye, the heart or the sexual organs (to pick something that matures long after birth) and so on. There is every reason to suppose that this mental organ, human language, develops in accordance with its genetically determined characteristics, with some minor modifications that give one language or another, depending on experience. But than, one would say the same about any bodily organ as far as I can see...|$|E

40|$|This paper lies at {{the edge}} of the topic of the workshop.
