5|$|The {{most common}} and empirically {{supported}} method for assessing attachment in infants (11 months–17 months) is the Strange Situation Protocol, developed by Mary Ainsworth {{as a result of}} her careful in-depth observations of infants with their mothers in Baltimore, USA (see below). The Strange Situation Protocol is a research tool that was not intended for diagnostic purposes. While the procedure may be used to supplement clinical impressions, the resulting classifications should not be confused with the psychiatric diagnosis 'Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)'. The clinical concept of RAD differs in a number of fundamental ways from the theory and research driven attachment classifications based on the Strange Situation Procedure. The idea that insecure attachments are synonymous with RAD is, in fact, not accurate and leads to ambiguity when formally discussing attachment theory as it has evolved in the research literature. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the concept of RAD is without merit, but rather that the clinical and research conceptualizations of insecure attachment and attachment disorder are not synonymous.|$|E
25|$|Significantly, it was {{not until}} the late 1990s that al-Qaeda began {{training}} Palestinians. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> resistance fighters are underrepresented in the network as a number of Palestinians, mostly coming from Jordan, wanted to join and have risen to serve high-profile roles in Afghanistan. Rather, large groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad – which cooperate with al-Qaeda in many respects – have had difficulties accepting a strategic alliance, fearing that al-Qaeda will co-opt their smaller cells. This may have changed recently, because the Israeli security and intelligence services believe that al-Qaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the Occupied Territories into Israel, and is waiting for the right time to mount an attack.|$|E

500|$|Wisemore is not {{the only}} one to serve as a means to comment on society; the {{characters}} Vermilia and Lady Matchless are used to discuss the proper role of females within society by serving as housewives. The dialogue between the two reveals that females are only in control of the domestic sphere because men have allowed them to dominate in the area. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Fielding supports the repression of females; instead, women are used as a way to discuss the internal aspects of humans including both emotions and morality. However, feminist critic Jill Campbell points out that Fielding does mock women who abuse their relationship with the internal, emotions, and morality in order to dominate and assume power. Tiffany Potter, another feminist critic, sees gender within the play in a different light; Merital's actions and words show a moderate approach to females, and [...] "Women are neither victims of deceitful men nor overdefensive virgins, but individuals who can choose to 'bestow' their favours on a man who will 'enjoy' them." ...|$|E

Inside those boundaries was a heritage of Romano-British society, laws, and customs that had evolved in the 350 years of Roman rule. Outside of those boundaries Roman rule was largely a matter of coexistence with the Roman military, without the same Roman contribution to local society, politics, laws, and customs. At the end of Roman rule, there were two societies with different histories, customs, and laws, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> any substantial difference in cultural mores.|$|R
40|$|International {{research}} consistently depicts {{young people}} leaving out-of-home care (care leavers) as being particularly disadvantaged and as having significantly reduced life chances (Munro et al., 2005; Stein, 2008).

In an extended sequence, Death relates stories of her encounters with people and culture.

40|$|This study {{covering}} the period 1951 - 52 to 1999 - 2000 finds that government deficit {{has been an}} important cause for long-run inflationary trend in India.

This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> in any way that there is more scope to finance government deficit through monetisation.

3000|$|... eThis <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> there <b>was</b> unanimous, {{universal}} {{acceptance of}} bhakti within Jainism. For example. Vattkera (circa 2 nd century A.D.) a Jaina ācārya from south India {{was an early}} critic. He argued that a saint who, prays to the Jina for freedom from birth and death, for enlightenment (bodhi-lābha) and {{for the preservation of}} auspicious thoughts at the time of Samādhi Maraṇa (death while in meditation) engages in false speech (asatya- mṛṣā). If he achieves greatness it is in spite of, not because of, such devotional outpourings. The same idea is conveyed by Samantabhadra, another renowned Digambara Jaina author of the 5 th century in his Āptamimāṃsā. Despite such voices of dissent, the lifeblood of Jainism continued to be devotional, or perhaps more modestly, continued to combine śramaṇic and devotional elements.|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the authors}} explore English as a Second Language (ESL) {{placement}} {{as a measure}} of how schools label and process immigrant students. Using propensity score matching and data from the Adolescent Health and Academic Achievement Study and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the authors estimate the effect of ESL placement on immigrant achievement. In schools with more immigrant students, the authors find that ESL placement results in higher levels of academic performance; in schools with few immigrant students, the effect reverses. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> a one-size-fits-all policy; many immigrant students, regardless of school composition, generational status, or ESL placement, struggle to achieve at levels sufficient for acceptance to a 4 -year university.

50|$|Unfortunately, in {{the absence}} of {{understanding}} and consideration of how need for cognitive closure may influence academic and/or achievement motivation, educators may erroneously conclude that a student does not have a desire to learn or that she/he has a cognitive, psychological, intellectual, or behavioral deficiency that is impeding the learning process. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> need for cognitive closure is a suitable explanation for all learning problems; however, in working with students who appear to be experiencing learning challenges manifested through amotivation or low motivation, it would not be unreasonable to explore need for cognitive closure as a potential factor.|$|E
