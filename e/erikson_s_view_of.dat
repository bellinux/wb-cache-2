40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to place the essays by James B. Thayer and Robert F. Nagel {{in the context of}} the framers 2 ̆ 7 <b>view</b> <b>of</b> human nature.

40|$|Inductive {{game theory}} has been {{developed}} to explore the origin of beliefs of a person from his accumulated experiences of a game situation. It has been restricted to a person 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the structure not including another person 2 ̆ 7 s thoughts. In this paper, we explore the experiential origin of one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the other 2 ̆ 7 s beliefs about the game situation, especially about the other 2 ̆ 7 s payoffs. We restrict our exploration to a 2 -role (strategic) game, which has been recurrently played by two people with occasional role-switching. Each person accumulates experiences of both roles, and these experiences become the source for his transpersonal view about the other. Reciprocity {{in the sense of}} role-switching is crucial for deriving his own and the other 2 ̆ 7 s beliefs. We also consider how a person can use these views for his behavior revision, and we define an equilibrium called an intrapersonal coordination equilibrium. Based on this, we show that cooperation will emerge as the degree of reciprocity increases...|$|R

40|$|In {{these remarks}} {{given at the}} Drake Constitutional Law Center Symposium, Professor Randy Barnett {{addresses}} his disagreement with Dan Farber 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the Ninth Amendment {{in his new book}} and with Kurt Lash 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the Ninth Amendment in his recent articles, and he asks why the Ninth Amendment and the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment have been overlooked. The author explains that his view is closer to Farber 2 ̆ 7 s; however, he asserts that the Ninth Amendment protects all fundamental liberties—not just some. He asserts that Lash incorrectly views the Ninth Amendment as protecting state majoritarianism rather than individual liberties. His argument relies on historically significant writings by Philadelphia Constitutional Convention delegate Representative Roger Sherman. The author responds to critics who worry that his broad <b>view</b> <b>of</b> liberty could permit courts to impede the workings of government by saying that rights do not receive absolute protection. Instead, his approach sensibly places the burden on the government to justify its restrictions on individual rights. Professor Barnett provided a detailed explanation of his theory in a significant recent book...|$|R
