In general, older Indo-European languages such as Latin, Ancient Greek, Old English, Old Norse, and Sanskrit are extensively inflected because of their temporal proximity to Proto-Indo-European. <b>Deflexion</b> has caused modern versions of some Indo-European languages that were previously highly inflected to be much less so; an example is Modern English, as compared to Old English. In general, languages where <b>deflexion</b> occurs replace inflectional complexity with more rigorous word order, which provides the lost inflectional details.

The period increased in darkness, but was unaffected by feeding, brief mechanical or electrical stimulation, longitudinal bisection of the column and excess KC 1 or MgCla; i* 6 mM-KCN abolished the rhythm. The O 2 depletion rate did not increase when the anemone contracted in response to stimulation, but it did after feeding, expo-sure to darkness, or the application of MgCla. It decreased in the presence of excess KC 1. These changes may result from alterations in shape of the anemone. The mechanism for the release of coelenteric fluid has yet to be elucidated.

40|$|Single {{micro-electrode}} voltage-clamp and current-clamp {{techniques were}} used to study cholinergic responses in single freshly isolated gastric smooth muscle cells from the toad Bufo marinus. Acetylcholine (ACh) or muscarine caused membrane depolarization, which sometimes gave rise to action potentials and contractions. The agonist-induced depolarization {{is due to the}} suppression of a voltage-dependent K+ conductance, a conclusion based on the following observations. Depolarization was accompanied by an apparent membrane conductance decrease, seen as the increased size of voltage <b>deflexions</b> in response to constant current pulses. The conductance decrease was confirmed under voltage clamp, where current <b>deflexions</b> in response to constant voltage jumps were smaller in the presence of cholinergic agonists. Muscarine induced net inward currents at potentials positive to the K+ equilibrium potential (EK), and net outward currents at potentials negative to EK. In experiments where external K+ concentration ([K+]o) ranged from 20 to 90 mM the reversal potentials shifted 58 mV positive per tenfold elevation of [K+]o, as expected for a K+ current. The steady-state current-voltage relationship revealed that the K+ current inhibited by muscarine was larger at more positive potentials than expected from driving force considerations alone. Therefore, the underlying conductance suppressed by cholinergic agonists was voltage dependent, with almost complete deactivation at potentials more negative than approximately - 70 mV and exhibiting a sigmoidal activation curve upon depolarization. The deactivation of this voltage-dependent K+ conductance caused slow current relaxations to occur in response to hyperpolarizing voltage commands from depolarized holding potentials. In experiments where [K+]o ranged from 3 to 30 mM, these current relaxations reversed direction at potentials near EK and the reversal potential shifted 52 mV positive per tenfold elevation of [K+]o, indicating that K ions carry most of the charge. The current relaxations that occurred in response to hyperpolarizing voltage commands were suppressed by ACh, muscarine and oxotremorine. The effects of muscarine persisted in nominally Ca 2 +-free solutions containing Mn 2 +. Ba 2 + mimicked the effects of muscarinic agonists. Thus, isolated smooth muscle cells exhibit a K+ current resembling the M-current of sympathetic and other neurones, which is reversibly suppressed by cholinergic agonists. The existence of a cholinergic K+ conductance decrease is of interest because it has not previously been demonstrated in smooth muscle...|$|R

6000|$|Throughout {{the years}} of Sir Robert Peel's government, Mr. Gladstone had been keenly intent upon the {{progress}} of religious affairs at Oxford. 'From 1841 till the beginning of 1845,' {{he says in a}} fragmentary note, 'I continued a hardworking official man, but with a decided predominance of religious over secular interests. Although I had little of direct connection with Oxford and its teachers, I was regarded in common fame as tarred with their brush; and I was not so blind as to be unaware that for the clergy this meant not yet indeed prosecution, but proscription and exclusion from advancement by either party in the state, and for laymen a vague and indeterminate prejudice with serious doubts how far persons infected in this particular manner could have any real capacity for affairs. Sir Robert Peel must, I think, have exercised much self-denial when he put me in his cabinet in 1843.' The movement that began in 1833 had by the opening of the next decade revealed startling tendencies, and its first stage was now slowly but unmistakeably passing into the second. Mr. Gladstone has told us[182] how he stood at this hour of crisis; how strongly he believed that the church of England would hold her ground, and even revive the allegiance not only of the masses, but of those large and powerful nonconforming bodies who were supposed to exist only {{as a consequence of the}} neglect of its duties by the national church.

A survey is made of the literature covering the twenty years since these constructions were intro-duced. This relates to: (1) the transient disturbance of single-degree-of-freedom systems (which may include damping, non-linearity, hysteresis, etc.) and of multi-degree-of-freedom systems; (2) the <b>deflexions</b> of beam columns in the theory of elastic stability; and (3) Jacobsen’s general method of graphical integration. Some new additions to the theory are given. These are: (1) a method of graphical differentiation; (2) a simplified approach to multi-degree-of-freedom systems leading to the treatment of transient loading of beams by moving and moving-and-varying loads (damping may be contemplated in these beam problems and the method that is devised easily carries over to certain plate problems); and (3) a demonstration that the graphical method can be used for deflexions-as well as bending moments-in the theory of beam columns.

During the first two or three division cycles the input resistance usually decreased {{by a factor of}} 2 - 10 and then subsequently rose during the blastula stages from a mean value of 600 ± 100 kO at stage 5 to 20 ± 0 - 5 MCI at stage 8. At all developmental stages examined, point polarization of a surface cell in the embryo by rectangular current pulses of 0 - 5 - 6 x 10 ~ 8 A produced voltage <b>deflexions</b> in other surface cells. This was seen even when several (7 - 8) cell junctions intervened between the current passing and voltage recording microelectrodes at distances of more than 1 mm. These measurements suggest that the junctional resistance is low compared with that at the surface, though the geometrical arrangement of cells is not favourable for calculation of absolute values of membrane resistance. Current spread between cells occurred apparently less easily during mid-blastula stages than at earlier stages in development, perhaps indicating an increase in junctional resistance during development.

Then the torsion index is to be turned until the ball connected with it (the repelled ball) is accurately at 30°, and finally the graduated arc belonging to the torsion index is to be adjusted so as to bring 0° upon it to the index. This state of the instrument was adopted as that which gave the most direct expression of the experimental results, and in the form having fewest variable errors; the angular distance of 30° being always retained as the standard distance to which the balls were in every case to be brought, and the whole of the torsion being read off at once on the graduated circle above. Under these circumstances the distance of the balls from each other was not merely the same in degree, but their position in the instrument, and in relation to every part of it, was actually the same every time that a measurement was made; so that all irregularities arising from slight difference of form and action in the instrument and the bodies around were avoided. The only difference which could occur in the position of anything within, consisted in the <b>deflexion</b> of the torsion thread from a vertical position, more or less, according to the force of repulsion of the balls; but this was so slight as to cause no interfering difference in the symmetry of form within the instrument, and gave no error in the amount of torsion force indicated on the graduation above.|$|E

The current-voltage relation of the non-junctional membrane was found ohmic over a membrane potential ranging from - 40 mV to + 10 mV. The mean value of Rm was 2020 omega cm 2.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the behaviour of thin webbed rolled steel joists or universal beams when they are subjected to concentrated loads applied to the flanges. The prime concern is the effect of high direct stresses causing web failure in a small region of the beam. The review shows that although many tests have been carried out on rolled steel beams and built up girders, no series of tests has restricted the number of variables involved to enable firm conclusions to be drawn. The results of 100 tests on several different rolled steel universal beam sections having various types of loading conditions are presented. The majority of the beams are tested by loading with two opposite loads, thus eliminating the effects of bending and shear, except for a small number of beams which are tested simply supported on varying spans. The test results are first compared with the present design standard (BS 449) and it is shown that the British Standard is very conservative for most of the loading conditions included in the tests but is unsafe for others. Three possible failure modes are then considered, overall elastic buckling of the web, flexural yielding of the web due to large out of plane <b>deflexions</b> and local crushing of the material at the junction of the web and the root fillets. Each mode is considered theoretically and developed to establish the main variables, thus enabling a comparison to be made with the test results. It is shown that all three failure modes have a particular relevance for individual loading conditions, but that determining the failure load given the beam size and the loading conditions is very difficult in certain instances. Finally it is shown that there are some empirical relationships between the failure loads and the type of loading for various beam serial sizes...|$|R

According to the Language Contact Hypothesis for <b>Deflexion,</b> {{supported}} by the comparison between Germanic languages, for instance, Icelandic and Afrikaans, this process is attributed to language contact. Specifically, the phenomenon occurs in the presence of large, influential groups of speakers that have acquired the leading idiom as a second language (L2 acquisition), thus by nature is limited to economical trade-offs widely considered acceptable. Though gradual, English experienced a dramatic change from Old English being a moderately inflected language using a complex case system, to Modern English, considered a weakly inflected language or even analytic. Important <b>deflexion</b> changes first arrived in the English language with the North Sea Germanic (Ingvaeonic) shifts, shared by Frisian and Low German dialects, such as merging accusative and dative cases into an objective case. Viking invasions and the subsequent Norman conquest accelerated the process.

50|$|Because the Proto-Indo-European {{language}} was highly inflected, {{all of its}} descendant Indo-European languages, such as Albanian, English, German, Ukrainian, Russian, Persian, Kurdish, Italian, Irish, Spanish, French, Hindi, Marathi, Urdu, Bengali, and Nepali, are inflected {{to a greater or}} lesser extent. In general, older Indo-European languages such as Latin, Ancient Greek, Old English, Old Norse, and Sanskrit are extensively inflected because of their temporal proximity to Proto-Indo-European. <b>Deflexion</b> has caused modern versions of some Indo-European languages that were previously highly inflected to be much less so; an example is Modern English, as compared to Old English. In general, languages where <b>deflexion</b> occurs replace inflectional complexity with more rigorous word order, which provides the lost inflectional details. Most Slavic languages and some Indo-Aryan languages are an exception to the general Indo-European <b>deflexion</b> trend, continuing to be highly inflected (in some cases acquiring additional inflectional complexity and grammatical genders, as in Czech & Marathi).|$|E
60|$|She {{had long}} ago, in her {{comings and goings}} made {{acquaintance}} with Park Chambers and reflected as {{she looked up at}} their luxurious front that they of course would supply the ideal setting for the ideal speech. There was not an object in London that, before the season was over, was more stamped upon her brain. She went roundabout to pass it, for it was not on the short way; she passed {{on the opposite side of}} the street and always looked up, though it had taken her a long time to be sure of the particular set of windows. She had made that out finally by an act of audacity that at the time had almost stopped her heart-beats and that in retrospect greatly quickened her blushes. One evening she had lingered late and watched--watched for some moment when the porter, who was in uniform and often on the steps, had gone in with a visitor. Then she followed boldly, on the calculation that he would have taken the visitor up and that the hall would be free. The hall was free, and the electric light played over the gilded and lettered board that showed the names and numbers of the occupants of the different floors. What she wanted looked straight at her--Captain Everard was on the third. It was as if, in the immense intimacy of this, they were, for the instant and the first time, face to face outside the cage. Alas! they were face to face but a second or two: she was whirled out on the wings of a panic fear that he might just then be entering or issuing. This fear was indeed, in her shameless <b>deflexions,</b> never very far from her, and was mixed in the oddest way with depressions and disappointments. It was dreadful, as she trembled by, to run the risk of looking to him as if she basely hung about; and yet it was dreadful to be obliged to pass only at such moments as put an encounter out of the question.|$|R
40|$|Cell pairs were {{isolated}} from ventricles of adult rat hearts {{so as to}} study cell-to-cell coupling. Both cells of each pair were impaled with micro-electrodes connected to balanced bridge circuits. Rectangular current pulses were passed and the resulting voltage <b>deflexions</b> monitored. The data were analysed {{in terms of a}} delta configuration of three resistive elements, the resistances of the non-junctional membrane of cell 1 and cell 2 (rm, 1 and rm, 2), and the resistance of the nexal membrane (rn). The nexal membrane resistance was found to be insensitive to voltage gradients across the non-junctional membrane (range examined: - 70 to - 10 mV) and direction of current flow. The mean value of rn was 2. 12 M omega ([K+]o = 12 mM). Taking into account morphological parameters, this corresponds to a specific nexal membrane resistance (Rn) of 0. 1 omega cm 2. Spontaneous uncoupling in which one cell remained polarized while the other one depolarized was never observed. The current-voltage relationship of the non-junctional membrane was found to be bell-shaped. The specific resistance (Rm) at the resting membrane potential (approximately - 50 mV) was 3. 2 k omega cm 2 ([K+]o = 12 mM). Comparative studies performed on single cells revealed a similar relationship Rm versus Vm. Rm at the resting membrane potential (Vm approximately - 50 mV) was 2. 5 k omega cm 2 ([K+]o = 12 mM). The specific capacitance of the non-junctional membrane (Cm) was determined from experiments on single cells. Cm was found to be independent of Vm (voltage range: - 80 to 0 mV). The mean value of Cm was 1. 66 microF/cm 2 ([K+]o = 12 mM). For comparison, experiments on cell pairs and single cells were also carried out with [K+]o = 4 mM. The values obtained for Rn, Rm and Cm did not deviate significantly from those found with [K+]o = 12 mM...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of the ciliary bundles of hair {{cells in the}} turtle cochlea was examined by deflecting them with flexible glass fibres of known compliance during simultaneous intracellular recording of the cell's membrane potential. Bundle motion was monitored through the attached fibre partially occluding a light beam incident on a photodiode array. The change in photocurrent {{was assumed to be}} proportional to bundle displacement. For <b>deflexions</b> of 1 - 100 nm towards the kinocilium, the stiffness of the ciliary bundles was estimated as about 6 X 10 (- 4) N/m, with the fibre attached {{to the top of the}} bundle. When the fibre was placed at different positions up the bundle, the stiffness decreased approximately as the inverse square of the distance from the ciliary base. This suggests that the bundles rotate about an axis close to the apical pole of the cell and have a rotational stiffness of about 2 X 10 (- 14) N. m/rad. Step displacements of the fixed end of the flexible fibre caused the hair cell's membrane potential to execute damped oscillations; the frequency of the oscillations in different cells ranged from 20 to 320 Hz. Displacements towards the kinocilium always produced membrane depolarization. The amplitude of the initial oscillation increased with displacements up to 100 nm and then saturated. For small displacements of a few nanometres, the hair cell's mechanoelectrical sensitivity was estimated as about 0. 2 mV/nm. Force steps delivered by the flexible fibre caused the bundle position to undergo damped oscillations in synchrony with the receptor potential. The mechanical oscillations could be abolished with large depolarizing currents that attenuated the receptor potential. When placed against a bundle, a fibre's spontaneous motion increased and became quasi-sinusoidal with an amplitude several times that expected from the compliance of the system. It is suggested that the hair bundle drives the fibre. We conclude that turtle cochlear hair cells contain an active force generating mechanism...|$|R
50|$|Directly {{related to}} <b>deflexion</b> {{is the fact}} that the {{languages}} become less synthetic and more analytic in nature. However, the ways in which languages undergo <b>deflexion</b> and the results of these developments are by no means uniform. For example, the modern Romance languages all continue to feature a complex verb system, while having strongly deflected their nouns, adjectives, and pronouns. German, on the hand, has further simplified the already simple Germanic verb system (even radically so in some dialects), but has preserved the three genders and four cases of early Germanic languages.|$|E

40|$|An {{initial and}} three {{subsequent}} yield surfaces were investigated for aluminium 6061 -T 651. The study was approached using theory of plates rather than thin-walled tubes {{because it was}} desired to investigate the entire two-dimensional space. The oblique shadow moiré method was employed to measure the <b>deflexions</b> of plates and the equipment used was simple, reducing considerably the scatter in the results. Since the plate thickness was a variable as far as strength criteria were concerned the {{study was limited to}} the relative shape of yield surfaces. Combinations of various ratios of bending moments were obtained in the second and fourth quadrants of the two-dimensional bending moment space by using rhomboid plates loaded anticlastically. The first and third quadrants were investigated using a superposition of a square plate supported at the four corners and loaded at the centre, and a square plate supported at two diagonally opposite corners and loaded at the centre. This approach produced combinations of various ratios of bending moments in plates loaded synclastically. To establish the initial yield surface for comparing it to subsequent yield surfaces, a series of specimens were loaded anticlastically, synclastically or subjected to uniaxial bending. The principal bending moments M 1 and M 2 at yielding were plotted in the two dimensional bending moment space. The shape of the initial locus fell between the Tresca and Mises loci. A first subsequent yield surface was established by pre-loading a series of plates anticlastically into the plastic region with M 1 = - M 2. A second subsequent yield surface was defined {{in the same manner as}} the first subsequent surface except that the direction for pre-bending into the plastic range was such that M 1 ≈ - 1 2 M 2. A third partial subsequent yield surface was found in the fourth quadrant only. The pre-loading path in this case was the same as in the first subsequent surface (M 1 = - M 2), the only difference being that the pre-loading was advanced further in the plastic region and it was followed by a recovery of the plates for three months at room temperature. The initial and the three subsequent yield surfaces were compared and important features of the behaviour of metals subjected to any type of biaxial loading and to any straining history were disclosed. © 1965...|$|R
50|$|<b>Deflexion</b> is a {{linguistic}} process related to inflectional languages.
