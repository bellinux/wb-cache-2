40|$|Purpose: {{of these}} {{researches}} {{was to determine}} influence of MMA technique and surfacing parameters of <b>gray</b> cast <b>iron</b> using CASTOLIN 27 coated electrodes on quality of deposits. Design/methodology/approach: single layer weave bead deposits and one layer overlapped multi weave bead deposits were MMA surfaced on <b>gray</b> cast <b>iron</b> type GG 25.

To determine quality of deposits hardness HRC measurements on the cross section of deposits, macrostructure and microstructure observations were done.
