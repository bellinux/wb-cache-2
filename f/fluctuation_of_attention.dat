40|$|Background: Marked {{impairments}} in and <b>fluctuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> {{are characteristic of}} dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The comparative impairment of these cognitive domains in PD and PD dementia (PD dementia) has not been studied, and {{is important to the}} conceptual understanding of parkinsonian dementias. Method: Detailed evaluations of attention and fluctuating attention (Cognitive Drug Research computerized battery) were undertaken in 278 subjects (50 DLB, 48 PD dementia, 50 PD, 80 AD, 50 elderly controls) from the Newcastle dementia register and the Stavanger PD register (controls, PD, and PD dementia patients were recruited from both centers). DLB, AD, PD, and PD dementia were diagnosed using operationalized criteria. Results: Impairments in reaction time, vigilance, and fluctuating attention were comparable in patients with DLB and PD dementia, but were less substantially impaired in patients with DLB without parkinsonism. Patients with PD had significantly greater impairment of cognitive reaction time than elderly controls, and comparable impairments of cognitive reaction time to patients with AD. Patients with PD, however, did not exhibit <b>fluctuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b> Conclusion: The profile of attentional impairments and fluctuating attention is similar in PD dementia and DLB with parkinsonism. The current findings do not support the current arbitrary distinctions between these patient groups. Importantly, patients with PD do not experience fluctuating attention...|$|E
40|$|Perceptual {{interpretation}} of the same multisensory stimuli may rely upon influence of attention on multisensory integration. We tested this hypothesis by recording the brain activity using magnetoencephalography in a passing-bouncing illusion with sound. Early activation of the attention-related brain areas and subsequent involvement of the multisensory areas {{were associated with the}} bouncing percept. Early activation of the unimodal sensory areas and later involvement of the attention-related areas were associated with the passing percept. Thus, the bouncing percept occurs when early attentional deployment facilitates multisensory integration modulating visual perception. The passing percept results from hierarchical sequence of the perceptual processes: early activation of the unimodal areas and late attentional deployment.

40|$|The dynamic {{attending}} theory {{proposes that}} rhythms entrain periodic <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> which modulate the gain of sensory input. However, temporal expectancies {{can also be}} driven by the mere passage of time (foreperiod effect). It is currently unknown how {{these two types of}} temporal expectancy relate to each other, i. e. whether they work in parallel and have distinguishable neural signatures. The current research addresses this issue. Participants either tapped a 1 Hz rhythm (active task) or were passively presented with the same rhythm using tactile stimulators (passive task). Based on this rhythm an auditory target was then presented early, in synchrony, or late. Behavioural results were in line with the dynamic attending theory as RTs were faster for in- compared to out-of-synchrony targets. Electrophysiological results suggested self-generated and externally induced rhythms to entrain neural oscillations in the delta frequency band. Auditory ERPs showed evidence of two distinct temporal expectancy processes. Both tasks demonstrated a pattern which followed a linear foreperiod effect. In the active task, however, we also observed an ERP effect consistent with the dynamic attending theory. This study shows that temporal expectancies generated by a rhythm and expectancy generated by the mere passage of time can work in parallel and sheds light on how these mechanisms are implemented in the brain...|$|R
40|$|Placebo {{analgesia}} {{is being}} increasingly appraised {{as an effective}} support of pharmacological and surgical treatments of pain. The understanding of its neurobiological and psychological basis is therefore of high clinical relevance. It {{has been shown that}} placebo analgesia is somatotopically organized and relies on endogenous opioids. However, {{it is not clear whether}} temporal <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> cue-dependent spatial <b>attention</b> account for the site specificity of placebo analgesia or whether a somatotopic placebo effect is possible without an attentional focus on the respective location. To address this issue we induced placebo expectations for one specific foot in healthy subjects, the other foot serving as a control location. The feet were stimulated in random order by painful laser stimuli. Half of the pulses were cued for stimulus location, whereas in the other half of trials the subjects were naïve about the location. We found that about half of the subjects exhibited a somatotopic placebo effect that was statistically independent of the spatial cue. We suggest that, after the induction of an initial expectation, placebo analgesia is spatially specific but does not necessarily depend on momentary <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> spatial <b>attention.</b> This result rather suggests that the somatotopy of placebo analgesia relies on the creation of spatially guided expectations or conditioning, but can be maintained without ongoing monitoring of the affected body part...|$|R
30|$|Dai himself [23], p. 3135] {{raised an}} {{important}} point when he noted that “The ability to trace the underlying psychometric function is particularly desirable when {{the performance of the}} observer undergoes a marked change as a result of learning, fatigue, <b>fluctuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> etc.”. Learning is often presumed to reflect reduction of internal noise. Unfortunately, the adaptive-tracking method itself may not take learning into account well, as no learning was mentioned in Schairer et al. [4] or in Schairer et al. [5], and no learning by listeners was evident in other papers from the same laboratory, papers concerning detection or discrimination (e.g., [13, 19, 25, 26]). In contrast, substantial learning was evident in the experiments reported here, manifested as shifts of the psychometric function to lower and lower SPLs over successive days of testing; a single complete psychometric function for a given time gap was produced by each subject on each testing day. In the present Experiments 1 and 2, learning effects were paramount despite subjects’ differences in the degree of previous laboratory listening experience (i.e., none for Subject 1 / 1 A and Subject 2 A, some for Subject 3, and very much for Subject 2). In each new stimulus condition of Experiments 1 and 2, improvement of detection threshold of as much as 10 dB occurred from the first to the second day’s trials, with successively lesser improvements over the following one or two days, just as found elsewhere for detection of longer tones [27, 28]. In Experiment 1, occasional within-day retesting with multiple probe-tone intensities showed that daily detection performance had asymptoted, but nonetheless, over successive days it continued to improve (see also [27 – 29]). As time gap in Experiment 1 changed from week to week, there was an imperceptible decline in the range of improvement in percentages-correct over successive days for a given time gap, an improvement seen elsewhere with another constant- intensities two-alternative forced-choice task [30] involving comparable time (months) and practice (thousands of trials). Of course, learning still re-occurred at each new time gap, just as found in experiments where a detected tonal frequency was changed [27]. Altogether, the learning effects noted here reflect those noted over a variety of much earlier studies, not all of which employed two-alternative forced-choice. Evidently, then, if “the underlying psychometric function is particularly desirable when the performance of the observer undergoes a marked change as a result of learning” [23], p. 3135], then such a psychometric function cannot be obtained through adaptive tracking, which cannot therefore be “a better choice than the constant-stimulus method for measuring psychometric functions” [23], p. 3135].|$|E
30|$|Psychologists {{are very}} good at {{studying}} the instant or an instantaneous slice out of a longer episode. Yet we often have very little to say about how information, or how a mental activity, is distributed over 1 h or more. Popular movies offer an opportunity to investigate such distributed information and mental activity and the linkage between them. Movies have: (1) shots that vary in duration which are separated by cuts that dictate eye movements; (2) scenes that vary in duration which control event structure and attention to the narrative; and varying (3) degrees of motion and (4) sound amplitude that also affect attention. In an investigation of 295 movies released from 1915 to 2015, we find that the film-length patterns of these four dimensions of movies have converged over the last 50 – 80 years on temporal fractal patterns (1 /f) and we find others that have not. These differences suggest that the fractal patterns are, in some sense, intentional on the part of filmmakers. Moreover, these results can be mapped onto their statements about the goals of their craft – to synchronize viewers’ attention with the rhythms of the movies. These 1 /f patterns also mimic the <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> shown in cognitive tasks (Gilden, 2001, 2009), suggesting that movie viewers’ attention patterns are not that different from those found in the laboratory.|$|R
40|$|Background Attentional deficits are {{described}} in the consensus clinical criteria for the operationalized diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) as characteristic of the condition. In addition, preliminary {{studies have indicated that}} both attentional impairments and <b>fluctuation</b> <b>of</b> attentional impairments are more marked in patients with DLB than in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), although neuropsychological function has not previously been examined in a large prospective cohort with confirmed diagnostic accuracy against postmortem diagnosis. Methods A detailed evaluation <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> and fluctuating attention was undertaken in 155 patients with dementia (85 with DLB and 80 with AD) from a representative hospital dementia case register and 35 elderly controls using the Cognitive Drug Research Computerized Assessment System for Dementia Patients computerized neuropsychological battery. Operationalized clinical diagnosis was made using the consensus criteria for DLB and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke–Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for AD. High levels of sensitivity and specificity have been achieved for the first 50 cases undergoing postmortem examination. Results The groups were well matched for severity of cognitive impairments, but the AD patients were older (mean age, 80 vs 78 years) and more likely to be female (55 % vs 40 %). Patients with DLB were significantly more impaired than patients with AD on all measures <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> and fluctuating attention (for all comparisons, t 2. 5, P<. 001), and patients from both dementia groups were significantly more impaired than elderly controls for all comparisons other than cognitive reaction time, which was significantly more impaired in DLB patients than controls but was comparable in controls and AD patients. There were, however, significant associations between the severity of cognitive impairment and the severity of both attentional deficits and fluctuations in attention. Conclusions This large prospective study confirms that slowing <b>of</b> cognitive processing, <b>attention,</b> and <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> are significantly more pronounced in DLB and AD patients, although fluctuating attention is common in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Deficits of cognitive reaction time appear to be specific to DLB, except in severe dementia. A detailed evaluation of attentional performance could make an important contribution to differential diagnosis, although the results need to be interpreted {{within the context of the}} overall severity of cognitive deficits...|$|R
40|$|Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) {{may develop}} {{progressive}} dementia late in their clinical course. Dementia in PD is mostly related to neuropathological findings of extensive Lewy bodies (LBs), {{with or without}} the coexistence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Aphasia has been reported in patients with LB diseases with AD pathology; however, there have been no reports of typical PD patients developing progressive aphasia during their clinical course. We describe a female PD patient who later developed progressive conduction aphasia characterized by phonemic paraphasia and disturbance in repetition of short sentences without disturbance in writing or auditory comprehension. No episodes <b>of</b> <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> memory complaints, or planning errors were observed. She experienced episodes of visual hallucination. Her low scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination suggested impairment <b>of</b> orientation and <b>attention,</b> and her scores on Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices test indicated impaired visuospatial functions. However, her cognitive deficits were not sufficiently severe to impair her daily life. Brain magnetic resonance images revealed atrophy of the left superior temporal gyrus and widening of the left sylvian fissure. [18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed glucose hypometabolism in the left cerebral hemisphere. These findings may be related to conduction aphasia. During the progression of PD lesions, the brainstem LB is assumed to take an upward course, extend to the limbic system, and then extend to the neocortex. Conduction aphasia observed in our patient may be associated with an unusual progression of the LB pathology from the brainstem to the left temporoparietal lobe. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} finding that {{simultaneous}} interpreters have an increased number of stutter-like disfluencies in their speech when working through noise, the thesis sets out to explore {{the relationship between the}} stutters of normal speakers under stress and pathological stuttering. Since the conditions under which pathological stuttering can be suppressed, and in particular the absence of auditory feedback, appear to involve distraction from auditory feedback, it is hypothesised that attention to auditory feedback is important in pathological stuttering. The thesis is designed to determine whether this is also true of the stutters of normal speakers under stress, particularly interpreters. The role of stress is discussed in terms of its effects on attention deployment. It is proposed that the known <b>attention</b> narrowing effect <b>of</b> stress or high arousal may be operating to direct attention intermittently to auditory feedback in all types of stuttering, including delayed auditory feedback stuttering. Experiment 1 investigates the effect of reducing, amplifying, and delaying auditory feedback, and of speech tasks requiring different patterns <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> deployment, on the occurrence of stutters. The known effects of delayed auditory feedback are found. Interpreting elicits more stutters than shadowing, and a significant relationship is found between stutters and failures to attend to simultaneous task input. Experiment 2 is designed to elicit stutters in normal speakers by inducing anxiety and <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> using electric shocks and a divided-attention speech task. Anxiety does not increase stutters, hut {{there is some evidence that}} it increases attention to auditory feedback. The divided-attention task succeeds in increasing stutters, and a control condition of masked auditory feedback reduces stutters. It is concluded that attention to auditory feedback plays a role in the stutters of normal speakers, but only when attention is divided or fluctuating, and that these findings are consistent with the view that pathological and normal stutters are related...|$|R
40|$|Rationale The {{specific}} role of neuromodulator systems in reg-ulating rapid <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> is still poorly understood. Objectives In this study, {{we examined the}} effects of clonidine and scopolamine on multiple target detection in a rapid serial visual presentation task to assess the role of the central norad-renergic and cholinergic systems in temporal attention. Method Eighteen healthy volunteers took part in a crossover double-dummy study in which they received clonidine (150 / 175 μg), scopolamine (1. 2 mg), and placebo by mouth in counterbalanced order. A dual-target attentional blink task was administered at 120 min after scopolamine intake and 180 min after clonidine intake. The electroencephalogram was measured during task performance. Results Clonidine and scopolamine both impaired detection of the first target (T 1). For clonidine, this impairment was accompanied by decreased amplitudes of the P 2 and P 3 com-ponents of the event-related potential. The drugs did not im-pair second-target (T 2) detection, except if T 2 was presented immediately after T 1. The attentional blink for T 2 was not affected, in line with a previous study that found no effect of clonidine on the attentional blink. Conclusions These and other results suggest that clonidine and scopolamine may impair temporal attention through a decrease in tonic alertness and that this decrease in alertness can be temporarily compensated by a phasic alerting response to a salient stimulus. The comparable behavioral effects of clonidine and scopolamine are consistent with animal studies indicating close interactions between the noradrenergic and cholinergic neuromodulator systems...|$|R

Until recently most Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) have been designed for clinical and research purposes partly due to their size and complexity. However, a new generation of consumer-oriented BCI has appeared for the video game industry. The MB, a headset with a single electrode, is based on electro-encephalogram readings (EEG) capturing faint electrical signals generated by neural activity.

40|$|A {{classical}} model <b>of</b> human <b>attention</b> {{holds that}} two main components <b>of</b> externally directed <b>attention</b> – stimulus-driven reorienting and executive control – rely on independent neural systems. However, questioning full independency, more recent network-based approaches to human brain function highlight {{the role of}} a common set of regions, often referred to as saliency or central executive network, in a huge variety of cognitive tasks involving externally directed attention. Furthermore, a common feature of these tasks is down-regulation of activity in the default mode network, which is upregulated when attention is directed internally. Finally, activation patterns diverge in temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), with increases during stimulus-driven, but decreases during executive control <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b> We explicitly addressed this question of specificity vs. commonality of neural networks related to stimulus-driven reorienting and executive control <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> in a task that independently manipulates both functions and probes for subjectively experienced <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> (i. e. mind-wandering). In a large sample (n = 282), reorienting was induced through invalid spatial cueing and executive control through flanker-target conflict while fMRI data were acquired. Results revealed a strong overlap of activations related to both attention functions in cingulo-opercular and fronto-parietal regions. Furthermore, activity in left anterior insula (AI) showed super-additive increases of activity during concurrent demand of both functions. Furthermore, the neural activation pattern in TPJ showed an anterior vs. posterior distinction, with reorienting related activation in anterior TPJ, but joint downregulation during concurrent demand of both functions in posterior TPJ – a region that was upregulated during subjective reports of mind-wandering. This dissociation was replicated in resting state functional connectivity analysis, embedding the anterior TPJ peak into the cingulo-opercular salience network, and posterior TPJ into the default mode network. Finally, task-based functional connectivity indicated inhibitory coupling between posterior TPJ and AI during concurrent attention demands. These results demonstrate involvement of domain-general brain networks in different attentional functions and a central role of anterior insula in regulating these networks. Implications of these findings for the relationship between lower-level domain general and higher-level socio-cognitive and socio-affective functions will be discussed. Furthermore, in light of mental training-induced changes in the investigated attentional, socio-affective, and socio-cognitive functions, we will discuss their involvement in different types of contemplative practice...|$|R

40|$|Oscillatory {{neuronal}} {{activity in}} the alpha band {{has been associated with}} both conscious perception and attention. Firstly, conscious perception of a weak sensory stimulus is preceded by alpha power decreases. Secondly, attention to a sensory event reduces alpha {{activity in the}} corresponding sensory regions. According to the widely accepted functional inhibition hypothesis, oscillatory neural activity in the alpha band reflects cortical excitability; in other words, a sensory region with low alpha power levels is more excitable. Several questions regarding the relationship between conscious perception, attention and alpha band activity have not been addressed so far. Firstly, it remained unclear whether brain states predisposing consciousness only comprise local pre-stimulus alpha power decreases, or also global network states. Secondly, it remained unclear whether alpha power decreases prior to conscious perception are confounded by <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> or not. The goal of the current thesis is to address these two open questions in the tactile modality with two magnetoencephalography studies. The first study explored brain states predisposing conscious tactile perception, with a particular focus on functional connectivity patterns in addition to alpha power modulations. To this end, a simple near-threshold detection paradigm was conducted, with weak tactile stimuli to the participants’ left index finger. Findings revealed that conscious perception is preceded by a) a relative alpha power decreases in the somatosensory cortex contralateral to stimulation, and b) a spectrally specific pattern of functional connectivity in the primary somatosensory cortex. Based on the first study, it can be concluded that brain states predisposing consciousness comprise local cortical excitability changes as well as frequency-specific network patterns. The second study focused on alpha power changes prior to conscious perception in the context <b>of</b> spatial <b>attention.</b> To this end, a near-threshold detection paradigm with a double-pulse target stimulus was combined with a spatial attention task. The results showed a) that spatial tactile attention modulates pre-stimulus alpha power, and b) that spontaneous alpha power fluctuations not explained by attention influence perception. These findings indicate that – while attention does affect pre-stimulus alpha power levels – spontaneous alpha power fluctuations predispose consciousness. Taken together, we conclude that brain states predisposing conscious perception comprise spectrally specific functional connectivity patterns, and alpha power fluctuations distinct from attention-induced alpha power modulations...|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{physiology}} of the corpus callosum, the greatest cerebral commissure, has made striking progress in recent years. Electrobiological, neurosurgical, and psychophysiological studies have demonstrated its functioning as an apparatus of immediate transmission of elementary sensory messages and of interhemispheric transfer of organized unilateral learnings. The symptoms which, in animal and in man, follow its complete section are now well known. These symptoms {{can be described as}} the manifestations of a disruption of mental unity, contrasting with the maintenance of a surprisingly good behavioural cohesion, and characterized, in conflicting situations, by the shifting dominance of one or the other hemisphere. Furthermore, the dependence of the bilateral synchrony of cortical electrical activity on the callosum has been confirmed by the long-term study of split-brain cats. In a discussion of the fundamental biological significance of the great cerebral commissure, the author stresses the theoretical importance of the recently demonstrated continuous interhemispheric exchange of callosal impulses, which reflects faithfully the <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>attention</b> level <b>of</b> the waking brain and disappears completely in deep sleep and in barbiturate narcosis. The experimental data underline the essentially dynamogenic character of this tonic activity, but a more refined analysis may reveal its inhibitory components as well. By analogy with the rostral (rhinencephalic) portion of the anterior commissure which connects the two olfactory bulbs, it is suggested that the original function of corpus callosum may have been the maintenance of a dynamic equilibrium between the two neo-cortices.

40|$|Attention {{is thought}} to improve most aspects of perception.

Here we investigated the neural basis of this effect and tested whether spontaneous <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> the attentional state can lead to low confidence in one's perceptual decision. We measured prestimulus functional magnetic resonance imaging activity in the dorsal attention network and used that activity as an index of the level <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> involved in a motion direction discrimination task. Extending our previous findings, we showed that low prestimulus activity in the dorsal attention network, which presumably reflected low level <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> was associated with higher confidence ratings. These results were explained by a signal detection theoretic model in which lack <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> increases the trial-by-trial variability of the internal perceptual response.

40|$|We {{consider}} the classical stochastic <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> spacetime geometry induced by quantum <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> massless non-conformal matter {{fields in the}} Early Universe. To this end, we supplement the stress-energy tensor of these fields with a stochastic part, which is computed {{along the lines of}} the Feynman-Vernon and Schwinger-Keldysh techniques; the Einstein equation is therefore upgraded to a so called Einstein-Langevin equation. We consider in some detail the conformal <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> flat spacetime and the <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> the scale factor in a simple cosmological modelintroduced by Hartle, which consists of a spatially flat isotropic cosmology driven by radiation and dust.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} work is {{development}} of a method of definition of {{the location of a}} source <b>of</b> <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> voltage. Methodology. The reasons <b>of</b> emergence <b>of</b> <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> voltage at an arrangement of a source both in power lines, and in the consumer's networks, are connected with changes of consumption and active and reactive capacities. As criterion for definition of the location of a source <b>of</b> <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> voltage we choose change of size of the active power received by reception substation on equivalent communication with system. The source <b>of</b> <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> voltage is external for the consumer if emergence <b>of</b> <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> voltage leads to the coordinated changes of tension and consumed in the area of active power that corresponds to a condition of the positive regulating effect of active loading on voltage (1). The source <b>of</b> <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> voltage is internal for the consumer if emergence <b>of</b> <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> voltage leads to counter changes of tension and consumed in the area of active power that resembles a condition of the negative regulating effect of active loading on voltage superficially (6). Results. The method of definition of the location of a source <b>of</b> <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> voltage in an electric network which, works by the principle of an assessment of correlation of change of power and tension in a power supply network is developed. The method allows to consider shift between extrema of curves of change of voltage of U(t) and power of Pload(t). Originality. The method of definition of an arrangement of a source <b>of</b> <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> voltage is developed. Practical value. The answer to this question where the source <b>of</b> <b>fluctuations</b> <b>of</b> voltage (in the territory of the consumer is located or in an external network) confirmed with the determined calculation, can form a basis of the expert opinion for the solution of legal disputes at an assessment of the damages caused by poor quality of electric energy...|$|R

Thus (L(y-y_n))(x_i)= 0. Because L(y-y_n) fluctuates, the <b>fluctuation</b> <b>of</b> y-y_n is possible. The <b>fluctuation</b> times <b>of</b> absolute errors {{are related to the}} number of nodes n+ 1. When n increases, the <b>fluctuation</b> times <b>of</b> absolute errors may grow.
