East of Philadelphia, the motive power is a Siemens ACS-64 electric locomotive; an <b>engine</b> <b>swap</b> is made at 30th Street Station in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|U-1 {{was laid}} {{down at the}} navy yard at Pola in July 1907, {{launched}} in February 1909, and underwent trials throughout 1910. She was commissioned in April 1911 {{and served as a}} training boat through 1914. Her periscope was damaged when she was accidentally rammed by an Austro-Hungarian cruiser in January 1914. At the beginning of World War I, U-1 was not operational because she was in drydock awaiting new batteries and replacement diesel engines. When the <b>engine</b> <b>swap</b> had been completed, U-1 served as a training boat for the Austro-Hungarian Navy through October 1915. From November that same year she conducted reconnaissance cruises out of Trieste and Pola until she was declared obsolete in early 1918. U-1 remained in service as a training boat at the submarine base on Brioni, but was at Pola {{at the end of the}} war. She was awarded to Italy as a war reparation in 1920 and scrapped at Pola. U-1 did not sink any ships during the war.|$|E

50|$|Any {{performance}} modifications {{available for}} the Nissan S30 cars {{can be applied to}} the Velo Rossa. These include brake and suspension upgrades, larger wheels and tires, and <b>engine</b> <b>swaps.</b> Chevrolet small-block <b>engine</b> <b>swaps,</b> including the LS-series, are common. More extreme <b>engine</b> <b>swaps</b> have included Jaguar V-12 engines, and a BMW V-12.|$|R
50|$|Depending {{on the car}} model, <b>engine</b> <b>swaps</b> are possible. This may {{range from}} a variant with forced {{induction}} (mounted with a supercharger or turbocharger), to swapping in a different engine from another vehicle by the same manufacturer. For example, the Nissan 350Z can have the V6 <b>engine</b> <b>swapped</b> with an RB26DETT found in the Skyline GT-R or a VK45DE from the Cima. Drivetrain and transmission swaps are also possible. For example, the Ford Focus ST170 can have, in place of its standard Getrag 6MT and FWD drivetrain, the Focus WRC's 6-speed sequential transmission and AWD drivetrain.|$|R
5000|$|Many (non-MC) CGs {{continued}} to be active in historic racing. Several of these cars were described as [...] "CG 1600s", but these {{appear to have been}} custom <b>engine</b> <b>swaps</b> rather than factory originals.|$|R
25|$|The two {{different}} engine models {{compatible with the}} 787 use a standard electrical interface to allow an aircraft to be fitted with either Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 or General Electric GEnx engines. This interchangeability aims to save time and cost when changing engine types; while previous aircraft could exchange engines for those of a different manufacturer, the high cost and time required made it rare. In 2006, Boeing addressed reports of an extended change period by stating that the 787 <b>engine</b> <b>swap</b> was intended to take 24 hours.|$|E
50|$|An <b>engine</b> <b>swap</b> is {{the process}} of {{removing}} a car's original engine and replacing it with another.|$|E
5000|$|Project Leopard - An Infiniti M30 {{converted}} to specs {{close to an}} R31 Nissan Skyline, receiving an RB25 <b>engine</b> <b>swap</b> {{as well as a}} conversion to Nissan 240SX suspension components.|$|E
50|$|In the Honda world, <b>engine</b> <b>swaps</b> {{include the}} Civic Si (B16A), The Civic Type R (B16B), Integra GSR(B18C), and the Integra Type R (B18C5) <b>engines.</b> More recently, <b>swapping</b> larger {{displacement}} Honda engines (such as the J-series V6) {{has become more}} popular. Swapping any of these motors into a lightweight 88-00 Honda Civic chassis can achieve greater performance.|$|R
50|$|Auto Modellista's {{customisation}} options also {{extends to}} visual enhancements, allowing the player {{to choose from}} many different color combinations, hood and spoiler types, plus the ability to add badges, stickers and even create license plates. <b>Engine</b> <b>swaps</b> are also available, for example, the Subaru 360 can have EJ20T in place of its EK32. <b>Swapped</b> <b>engines</b> cannot be retuned in the game.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{difference}} in engine output and modification potential between the American and JDM models, the second-generation Si sparked a popular trend of <b>engine</b> <b>swapping,</b> where tuners would replace the D-series power plant with a more powerful B-series motor.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} <b>engine</b> <b>swap</b> for MX-3 GS owners with the V6 engine is a 2.5 L V6, either a North American-spec KL-DE , found most {{commonly}} in the 1993-1997 Ford Probe GT, the 1993-1997 Mazda MX-6 LS, or the 1993-2002 Mazda 626 LX or ES, and the Japanese-spec KL-ZE , found in such vehicles as the Efini MS-8, Xedos 9, and Eunos 800. A 2.0 L V6 KF-ZE is also available, but this swap is quite difficult {{due to the}} unavailability of required components. For this reason, this particular <b>engine</b> <b>swap</b> is not often attempted.The GS, apart from the engine has dual tip exhaust, a tighter steering ratio, four disc brakes and front and rear spoiler.|$|E
5000|$|In jurisdictions such as California, with strict, {{arbitrary}} smog rules, {{it may not}} {{be possible}} to register a late-model vehicle with an <b>engine</b> <b>swap,</b> even if it can be proven to produce less pollution than the original engine (owing to [...] "visual inspection" [...] rules).|$|E
5000|$|Many {{cars were}} [...] "hopped up" [...] with engine {{modifications}} such as adding additional carburetors, high compression heads, and dual exhausts. <b>Engine</b> <b>swaps</b> were often done, {{the object of}} which was to put the most powerful engine in the lightest possible frame and body combination.|$|R
50|$|In the Super GT racing series, <b>engine</b> <b>swaps</b> can be {{considered}} {{a way of life for}} the upper tier GT500 cars, most of which are provided with specially modified racing engines from the manufacturers. GT500 class rules themselves allow for any <b>engine</b> to be <b>swapped</b> into a car as long as it is from the same manufacturer. Notable examples include Toyota swapping in highly tuned 4-cylinder engines originally from the Toyota Celica into their Toyota Supra GT500 race cars.|$|R
5000|$|The GY6 {{engine was}} {{originally}} developed by Honda {{for use in}} its motor scooters. [...] It was later adopted by many scooter and light vehicle manufacturers (ATV etc.) across Taiwan, PRC and South East Asia. The 150cc examples are popular alternatives to 50cc Honda Ruckus owners as candidates for <b>engine</b> <b>swaps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Privateer racing {{teams in}} Japan {{would use the}} AE85 and convert it to an AE86 since it is much cheaper by {{performing}} an <b>engine</b> <b>swap.</b> Using modifications such as a bolt-on turbo or supercharger, racers can strengthen their vehicle while keeping the light weight of the AE85 body.|$|E

50|$|The inexperienced Nakano, meanwhile, proved solid if not spectacular, scoring {{two points}} for sixth places at Canada (after {{the race was}} stopped {{following}} Panis' crash) and Hungary. However, he did not retain his seat for 1998, as Panis stayed on alongside Trulli and the team took on Peugeot <b>engines,</b> <b>swapping</b> with Jordan.|$|R
50|$|Because {{they were}} {{primarily}} built for racing, these cars typically had the <b>engine</b> <b>swapped</b> {{to a larger}} or more powerful one, or the existing stock engine modified (often heavily). It was very common to fit a Roots supercharger modified from original use on General Motors two-cycle diesel truck engines and mechanical fuel injection, manufactured by Algon, Hilborn, or Crower.|$|R
50|$|A {{specially}} built PA-2 {{was flown}} by Jim Ray in the 1926 Ford National Reliability Air Tour. It placed {{second in a}} race for engines under 800 cubic inches displacement, then it had its <b>engine</b> <b>swapped</b> to an OX-5 for a race the next day, and again back to a Curtiss C-6 engine {{the next day to}} win the Detroit race.|$|R
50|$|A {{car that}} has had its body work {{restored}} to as new condition but has undergone some modifications elsewhere is either a modified car or a resto-mod car, neither being completely restored nor completely modified. If a car has had an <b>engine</b> <b>swap</b> for other than the original model, that car has not been restored. Although most of the parts are original, it qualifies as modified rather than restored.|$|E
50|$|The {{very first}} car {{is now in}} Czech National Technical Museum and is still driveable. Unfortunately, before it was handed to the Museum in 1918, it was used in Austria to train drivers and it {{underwent}} some modifications, which infringed the original design (including <b>engine</b> <b>swap).</b> The engine which {{is now in the}} Präsident is probably the first one made in Kopřivnice, after the manufacture of engines started in 1900.|$|E

The LS Fest has been continuing every year since in September.|$|E
50|$|Despite being {{a modest}} car, the Civic is popular as a {{platform}} for modification and customization by the enthusiast community. Starting with the fourth generation and continuing through the 2000 model year, Civics had front double wishbone suspension and rear semi-trailing arm suspension. Ready parts interchangeability allows easy <b>engine</b> <b>swaps</b> (primarily with more powerful B16A (Civic SI), B18C (Acura Integra GSR), and various K20 Civic motors) and many other upgrades.|$|R
50|$|Four Wheeler was the first, {{and is the}} oldest, {{magazine}} for the 4x4 and off-road truck and SUV enthusiast. The first issue was published in February 1962, and in 2012, the internationally read magazine celebrated its 50th anniversary. Four Wheeler focuses on new-vehicle evaluations, project vehicles, {{the technical aspects of}} building a vehicle (such as how to install aftermarket accessories and do complete <b>engine</b> <b>swaps),</b> product tests, outdoor equipment and machines, 4x4 shows and competitions, and travel and adventure.|$|R
5000|$|Restriction of <b>engine</b> <b>swaps</b> {{from other}} model into other model, as S15 Silvia Spec-S to Spec-R {{specification}} (SR20DE→SR20DET) may be permitted but a RB26DETT into an HR32 Skyline GTS-t is not unless {{the model is}} a BNR32, nor even is converting an AE85 to AE86 is permitted. Engines from other manufacturer's car (e.g. Darren McNamara's 13B-REW powered AE86) are not permitted as well. A bolt on turbocharger or supercharger is permitted, the engine in the car can {{be determined by the}} VIN plate ...|$|R
50|$|Swapping of the four-cylinder RS engines is {{slightly}} {{more complicated than}} the V6 GS mainly due to ECU, wiring harness, and MAF combinations as well as motor mounts. The V6 swaps require specific ECU, intake manifold, and VAF sensor combinations, but there are far fewer variables to deal with. Many improvements can be made after the <b>engine</b> <b>swap</b> and during the engine tuning process {{to find the best}} combination of engine peripherals.|$|E
50|$|The German-built Ford Puma {{was based}} on the Mark IV, sharing its underpinnings. For this reason the 1.7 VCT engine from the Ford Puma has become an {{extremely}} popular <b>engine</b> <b>swap</b> into the Mark IV and Mark IV facelift Fiesta. This gives the popular hatchback an extra 100 cc over the previous largest engine size available, variable cam timing and better ratio gearbox while still retaining a factory finish as all components are a direct swap.|$|E

50|$|Many {{aftermarket}} improvements {{have been}} offered over time {{to address some of}} the flaws in the original production cars, and to improve performance. A common opinion of the car is that in stock form it is somewhat underpowered, and a variety of solutions have been implemented, from complete <b>engine</b> <b>swaps</b> (either to a larger PRV engine, or to completely different engines such as the Cadillac Northstar engine), turbocharger kits (single or twin-turbo), down to simpler solutions such as improved exhausts and other normal engine tuning work.|$|R
5000|$|The service {{department}} specialized in <b>engine</b> <b>swaps,</b> transplanting 427 {{cubic inch displacement}} (CID) [...] "Big Block" [...] Chevy engines into the very first 1967 Camaros, and soon there after into Novas, Chevelles, Impalas and even Corvettes. Nickey Chevrolet modified hundreds of cars to their customers’ specifications. A customer could walk into the dealership, pick out a car, and then have it modified to their taste. Most of these domestic modified cars are maintained in museums or private collections and are rarely seen in public.|$|R
50|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>swaps</b> {{are also}} {{somewhat}} common within the Volkswagen tuning scene, often placing Type 2 (Bus), Type 3, and Type 4 (Squareback) engines in the Type 1 (Beetle). Water-cooled engines, {{such as the}} GTI 16-valve four, VR6, or 1.8 T are commonly swapped into the Mark II GTI, Jetta, and Corrado. Less common is the swap into a Mark 1 Golf or Cabriolet, giving an amazing power-to-weight ratio, even with minimally modified powerplants. Porsche engines are also very popular {{one of the most}} popular is to take the engine from a Porsche 911 super 1600.|$|R
