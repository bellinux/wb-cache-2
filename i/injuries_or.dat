Dílny tvořivosti is an organization which focuses on work with people with brain <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> damage. I try to find out at my bachelor thesis how much Dílny tvořivosti are important for people with brain <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> damage in their integration and how they are satisfied with services which Dílny tvořivosti offer them. Bachelor thesis includes two parts, theoretical and practical. In the theoretical part consequence of brain <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> damage, functions and aims of ergotherapy and acquirement of working habits are described. There are also traced availability of social services for people with brain <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> damage and all services provided to people with brain <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> damage too. The Last chapter of the theoretical part is devoted to organization Dílny tvořivosti, its history and its services which they offer. The aim of practical part {{is to find out}} how much Dílny tvořivosti are important in integration into society.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} extent to which a current <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> {{disability}} is a significant barrier to being more active. Methods: Data on current <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> disability as a reported barrier to being more physically active were extracted from an urban-representative population survey. Multivariate logistic regression analyses assessed the association between gender, educational attainment, age, body mass index, and current physical activity levels with <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> disability as a barrier. Results: Twenty percent of the survey respondents gave current <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> disability as a reason for not being more active. There were no significant differences between male and female subjects. There was a significant trend toward a higher reporting of current <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> disability as a barrier, with increasing age (P < 0. 001). High body mass index (P < 0. 001) and current physical activity levels (...|$|R

5|$|A {{pulmonary}} contusion {{is usually}} caused directly by blunt trauma {{but can also}} result from explosion <b>injuries</b> <b>or</b> a shock wave associated with penetrating trauma. With the use of explosives during World Wars I and II, pulmonary contusion resulting from blasts gained recognition. In the 1960s its occurrence in civilians began to receive wider recognition, in which cases it is usually caused by traffic accidents. The use of seat belts and airbags reduces the risk to vehicle occupants.|$|E
5|$|After the Hessians {{entered the}} fort, the American {{officers}} attempted to placate the Hessian commander, Captain von Malmburg, {{who was in}} charge of the surrender. They invited him into their barracks, and offered him punch, wine, cake, with compliments. As they left the fort, the Hessians stripped the American troops of their baggage and beat some of them. Their officers intervened to prevent further <b>injuries</b> <b>or</b> deaths. The British captured thirty-four cannons, two howitzers, along with many tents, blankets, tools and much ammunition.|$|E

5|$|As {{with each}} All-Star Game since 1970, the eight {{starting}} position players (with no designated hitter due to playing in an NL stadium) of each league were elected by fan balloting. The remaining players were selected by a players' vote, each league's team manager, {{and a second}} fan balloting to add one more player to each roster. In all, 32players were selected to each league's team, not including players who decline to play due to <b>injuries</b> <b>or</b> personal reasons.|$|E
5|$|In North Carolina, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch {{due to the}} large influx of people expected during the holiday weekend. As such, {{there was a significant}} drop in tourism, although no significantly adverse weather occurred along the Outer Banks. High waves and some minor beach erosion was reported, but there were no deaths, <b>injuries,</b> <b>or</b> damage from Ella. By the time the hurricane passed Newfoundland, the strongest winds were to the southeast of the center, and as a result, no significant impact was reported on Canada.|$|E

He struggled in the first two first-class matches, before taking 6/101 and scoring 59 in the second match against South Africa A to end the three games with ten wickets at 32.50. He had more success in the one-dayers, taking four wickets at 17.50 at an economy rate of 2.50 in three matches.|$|E

5|$|Suffering a {{wound on}} the Borodino {{battlefield}} was effectively a death sentence, as French forces did not possess enough {{food for the}} healthy, much less the sick; consequently, equal numbers of wounded soldiers starved to death, died of their <b>injuries,</b> <b>or</b> perished through neglect. The casualties were for a single day of battle, while the Russian figures are for the 5th and the 7th, combined. Using the same accounting method for both armies brings the actual French Army casualty count to 34,000–35,000.|$|E
5|$|The playable {{character}} can lead {{a group of}} three additional allies into battle, controlling their actions to attack a single enemy or to use specific powers. Characters can be set to one of three modes: defensive, neutral, or offensive. In defensive mode, the character remains distant from battles, while offensive mode sends the character directly into battle. The main character and active allies are represented by portraits on screen that reflect their current physical or emotional state, showing sadness, anger, feeding, or the presence of <b>injuries</b> <b>or</b> staking—having been stabbed through the heart and rendered immobile.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} produced 2–5inches (50–125mm) {{of rainfall}} throughout windward {{areas of the}} Big Island of Hawaii and Maui on July28 and 29. West Wailuaiki on Maui recorded 3.87inches (98.3mm) in one day, which was the highest daily rainfall total from the hurricane. The storm also dropped precipitation on the East Maui watershed. The rainfall—particularly in Kailua-Kona on the Big Island—caused ponding on roadways, as well as flooding of small streams. However, no <b>injuries</b> <b>or</b> serious damage were reported. A station in Ka Lae briefly reported sustained winds of about 35mph (55km/h) with gusts to 45mph (75km/h).|$|E

5|$|Vessel strikes cause {{death for}} a number of marine mammals, {{especially}} whales. In particular, fast commercial vessels such as container ships can cause major <b>injuries</b> <b>or</b> death when they collide with marine mammals. Collisions occur both with large commercial vessels and recreational boats and cause injury to whales or smaller cetaceans. The critically endangered North Atlantic right whale is particularly affected by vessel strikes. Tourism boats designed for whale and dolphin watching can also negatively impact on marine mammals by interfering with their natural behavior.|$|E
5|$|A common belief {{regarding}} self-harm {{is that it}} is an attention-seeking behaviour; however, in many cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers {{are very}} self-conscious of their wounds and scars and feel guilty about their behaviour, leading them to {{go to great lengths to}} conceal their behaviour from others. They may offer alternative explanations for their <b>injuries,</b> <b>or</b> conceal their scars with clothing. Self-harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para-suicidal behaviour. People who self-harm are not usually seeking to end their own life; it has been suggested instead that they are using self-harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress. Alternatively, interpretations based on the supposed lethality of a self-harm may not give clear indications as to its intent: life risking behaviour may have no suicidal intent, whilst seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|Although Sir Flinders {{himself did}} not join the {{expedition}} in 1929, he sent Olga {{with a group of}} other archaeologists to Qau, where they spent two months recording the reliefs from the tombs of the ancient rulers. She and a few colleagues, including Gerald Lankester Harding, then joined the season's primary expedition, which was being led by James Leslie Starkey at the Tell Far'a tomb group in Palestine. During the time she would not only supervise the work of a team, but also ran an evening clinic for the Arab workers and families, as well as other local people. In all, she would help up to forty people per day with minor <b>injuries</b> <b>or</b> upset stomachs. Sir Flinders joined the group in 1930 and after reviewing Olga's work, allowed her to publish it under her own name. In 1931, during the Petrie expedition to Tell el-'Ajjul, Olga discovered a Hyksos tomb which included a horse burial.|$|E
