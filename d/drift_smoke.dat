6000|$|We {{have spoken}} {{together}} with naked hearts before this, and our hands have dipped {{into the same}} dish and thou hast been {{to me as a}} brother. Therefore I pay thee back with lies and ingratitude--as a Pathan. Listen now! When the grief of the soul is too heavy for endurance it may be a little eased by speech, and, moreover, the mind of a true man is as a well, and the pebble of confession dropped therein sinks and is no more seen. From the Valley have I come on foot, league by league, with a fire in my chest like the fire of the Pit. And why? Hast thou, then, so quickly forgotten our customs, among this folk who sell their wives and their daughters for silver? Come back with me to the North and be among men once more. Come back, when this matter is accomplished and I call for thee! The bloom of the peach-orchards is upon all the Valley, and here is only dust and a great stink. There is a pleasant wind among the mulberry trees, and the streams are bright with snow-water, and the caravans go up and the caravans go down, and a hundred fires sparkle in the gut of the Pass, and tent-peg answers hammer-nose, and pack-horse squeals to pack-horse across the <b>drift</b> <b>smoke</b> of the evening. It is good in the North now. Come back with me. Let us return to our own people! Come! ...|$|E
50|$|The fire neared many famous natural landmarks, {{including}} Hume Lake, and Hume Lake Christian Camps on {{the southern}} side of the fire. Most progress on battling the fire has been {{on the southern}} side, while the northern edge continues to burn, now 30 miles from the city of Fresno, California and Clovis, California. <b>Drift</b> <b>smoke</b> from the fire settled over Fresno, and Clovis which led the Clovis Unified School District to cancel outdoor recess and gym class on September 8.|$|E

5|$|Following {{a report}} by George Ivatt in 1945, smoke {{deflectors}} were introduced due to <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke</b> obscuring the crew's forward vision. The first locomotive to be fitted with smoke deflectors from the outset was No. 6253 City of St. Albans in September 1946. All the following four locomotives included this feature. The first unstreamlined locomotive to be retrofitted was No. 6232 Duchess of Montrose in February 1945.|$|R
50|$|From late 1931, {{after several}} bizarre forms of smoke {{deflectors}} were tried on various locomotives to stop <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke</b> obscuring the crew's forward vision, the straight sided smoke deflectors were added. These were later replaced by deflectors with angled top. From 1933 the class were {{taken off the}} top-link expresses, being superseded by the LMS Princess Royal Class and later the LMS Princess Coronation Class pacifics.|$|R

60|$|There was {{a hoarse}} shout from the trooper, and no answer, and a carbine flashed. Then Courthorne loosed the bridle, reeled {{sideways}} from the saddle, rolled half round {{with one foot}} in the stirrup and his head upon the ground, and was left behind, while the riderless horse and pursuer swept past the two men who, avoiding them by a hairsbreadth, sat motionless a moment in the thin <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was, {{considering}} the latest price of wheat, a somewhat astonishing attendance {{in the long}} room of the hotel at the railroad settlement one Saturday evening. A big stove {{in the midst of}} it diffused a stuffy and almost unnecessary heat, gaudy nickeled lamps an uncertain brilliancy, and the place was filled with the <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke</b> of indifferent tobacco. Oleographs, barbaric in color and drawing, hung about the roughly-boarded walls, and any critical stranger would have found the saloon comfortless and tawdry.|$|R
5000|$|The class earned {{themselves}} the name the [...] "whispering giants". They {{were known as}} such, not for their soft exhaust - the 520s, while {{not as much as}} their larger 500B cousins, still shook the earth on their ascent into Mount Lofty Yard. Due to their long boilers the class had the characteristic feature of requiring blower assistance while in yards to prevent blowback or <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke</b> into the cab, which was nearly entirely closed. Hence, when drifting or in stations or stationary, the class were known to quietly whisper.|$|R
60|$|I was {{so intent}} upon these peculiarities that I {{scarcely}} noticed the path we followed. Presently {{we came to}} trees, all charred and brown, and so to a bare place covered with a yellow-white incrustation, across which a <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke,</b> pungent in whiffs to nose and eyes, went drifting. On our right, over a shoulder of bare rock, I saw the level blue of the sea. The path coiled down abruptly into a narrow ravine between two tumbled and knotty masses of blackish scoriae. Into this we plunged.|$|R

Eight days from now, we shall be wide asunder; for I shall be {{on the border of}} the Pacific, and you far out on the Atlantic, {{approaching}} England. That day, if I am alive and my sublime discovery is proved and established, I will send you greeting, and my messenger shall deliver it where you are, in the solitudes of the sea; for I will waft a vast sun-spot across the disk like <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke,</b> and you will know it for my love-sign, and will say [...] "Mulberry Sellers throws us a kiss across the universe." ...|$|R
500|$|The Enola Gay (...) is a Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, {{named for}} Enola Gay Tibbets, {{the mother of}} the pilot, Colonel Paul Tibbets, who {{selected}} the aircraft while it was still on the assembly line. On 6 August 1945, during the final stages of World War II, it became the first aircraft to drop an atomic bomb. The bomb, code-named [...] "Little Boy", was targeted at the city of Hiroshima, Japan, and caused unprecedented destruction. Enola Gay participated in the second atomic attack as the weather reconnaissance aircraft for the primary target of Kokura. Clouds and <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke</b> resulted in a secondary target, Nagasaki, being bombed instead.|$|R
50|$|Even {{though the}} haze had cleared {{off a bit}} in the {{southern}} parts of the nation, Port Klang recorded a Very unhealthy series of API values which reached the Hazardous range with a reading of 487 in the morning of 25 June. The <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke</b> from the south also caused other places in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur to be blanketed by thick smog, resulting in the API coming very close to entering the Hazardous level. Seri Manjung in Perak which is 200 km away from Port Klang was also hit hard by the haze. Visibility remained poor in Kuala Lumpur and several other states.|$|R

5000|$|In January 2009, Belmont {{adopted an}} {{ordinance}} that bans smoking in city parks, all businesses, and all multi-story apartments and condominiums. The policy, {{which has been}} described as perhaps the strictest anti-smoking law in the nation, {{was the result of a}} group of retirees lobbying the city to stop secondhand <b>smoke</b> from <b>drifting</b> into their apartments from neighboring places. Public health advocates consider the ordinance to be a new front in a national battle against tobacco; officials from the American Lung Association of California said [...] "Belmont broke through this invisible barrier in the sense that it addressed <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke</b> in housing as a public health issue." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{a horrible}} stench struck Carley {{almost like a}} blow in the face, and before her {{confused}} sight {{there appeared to be}} <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke</b> and active men and running sheep, all against a background of mud. But at first it was the odor that caused Carley to close her eyes and press her knees hard against the upper log to keep from reeling. Never in her life had such a sickening nausea assailed her. It appeared to attack her whole body. The forerunning qualm of seasickness was as nothing to this. Carley gave a gasp, pinched her nose between her fingers so she could not smell, and opened her eyes.|$|R
5000|$|... 6233 was outshopped in July 1938 from Crewe Works and {{was part}} of the third batch of her class. These were unstreamlined, painted in LMS {{standard}} crimson lake livery and had a single chimney and no smoke deflectors and an estimated cost of £13,800 each.6233 was initially allocated to Camden, London. It acquired a double chimney in March 1941 and because of <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke</b> acquired smoke deflectors in September 1945 before being painted in postwar LMS black livery in September 1946. With the creation of British Railways on 1 January 1948 it was allocated to Crewe North depot. BR renumbered the locomotive to 46233 in October 1948 and repainted it in BR Brunswick green livery in 1952 or early 1953. In June 1958 it was allocated to Carlisle Upperby before eventually being withdrawn from Edge Hill depot in February 1964. During its 25 years service Duchess of Sutherland ran 1,650,000 miles - the second highest mileage by any member of the class.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} {{target for}} the bomb was the city of Kokura, but it {{was found to be}} obscured by clouds and <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke</b> from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby Yahata the previous day. This covered 70% of the area over Kokura, obscuring the aiming point. Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, burning fuel and repeatedly exposing the aircraft to the heavy defenses of Yawata, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually. By the time of the third bomb run, Japanese anti-aircraft fire was getting close, and Second Lieutenant Jacob Beser, who was monitoring Japanese communications, reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio bands.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of September 8, the number of homes {{destroyed}} reached 1,386. Texan officials also reported that they lacked the tanks and pipes necessary to load Tanker 910, a converted McDonnell Douglas DC-10 airtanker, with fire retardant, {{as well as a}} qualified aerial firefighting pilot to operate it. Air quality in neighboring Austin reportedly reached 14-year lows due to <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke</b> from the fire. In the evening of September 8, officials announced that they expected Tanker 910 to be in action by {{the morning of}} Friday September 9. However, Tanker 910 ultimately did not receive authorisation to combat the Bastrop fire, instead being used to fight a separate wildfire outside Houston.|$|R

60|$|He {{caught the}} major {{by the arm}} and rushed him into the smoke, {{apparently}} {{in the direction of the}} greatest mass of flame. The heat was suffocating, but it struck the major that the more they approached the actual scene of conflagration the heat and smoke became less, until he saw that the fire was retreating before them and the following wind. In a few moments their haven of safety--the expanse already burnt over--came in sight. Here and there, seen dimly through the <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke,</b> the scattered embers that still strewed the forest floor glowed in weird nebulous spots like will-o'-the-wisps. For an instant the major hesitated; the sheriff cast a significant glance behind them.|$|R

60|$|Ahead of {{the ship}} he {{perceived}} a great darkness lying upon a multitude of white flashes; on the starboard beam a few amazing stars drooped, dim and fitful, above an immense waste of broken seas, as if seen through a mad <b>drift</b> of <b>smoke.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{quality of}} the {{original}} design was such that No. A866 was put {{on display at the}} British Empire Exhibition at Wembley from May to November 1925, and no class-wide modifications were made until 1934. This was when the SECR and Woolwich batches began to receive new domes and front footsteps during overhauls and general repairs. These were the same design as those used on Nos.14001414, and were intended to standardise components between the batches. The SECR and Woolwich batches also received smoke deflectors to prevent <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke</b> from obscuring the driver's vision ahead. The U1 chimneys replaced the standard Nclass type on the earlier locomotives, which, along with the removal of the piston tail rods on the earlier batches, created a truly standardised appearance.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} the year, The Observer listed Think Tank as {{the best}} album of 2003, Miranda Sawyer writing that, [...] "Think Tank is the band's first warm album. They have hopped genres in the past, from baggy to mod to pop to grunge to art-rock, but the sound has always stayed urban, Western, cool. Think Tank is none of these things. It's all over the place, and that place is foreign. Odd noises, strange instruments, keening vocals; its tunes wind {{themselves}} around your heart like <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke.</b> They waft in from faraway lands; trail and trickle their scent across your life. It is the most peculiar stuff that stays with you; [...] "Ambulance"'s slurred symphony; [...] "Caravan"'s star-speckled wonder." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{country had}} been a place of terror; but the town was in its way even more depressing. Down that long valley {{there was at least}} a certain gloomy {{grandeur}} in the huge fires and the clouds of <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke,</b> while the strength and industry of man found fitting monuments in the hills which he had spilled by the side of his monstrous excavations. But the town showed a dead level of mean ugliness and squalor. The broad street was churned up by the traffic into a horrible rutted paste of muddy snow. The sidewalks were narrow and uneven. The numerous gas-lamps served only to show more clearly a long line of wooden houses, each with its veranda facing the street, unkempt and dirty.|$|R
60|$|Then another rifle flashed, {{there was}} a sudden shouting, and a tumultuous patter of naked feet, and a shadowy mass of running figures hurled {{themselves}} at the stockade. A good many of them never reached it, for the dusky barrier blazed with twinkling points of light, and a withering volley met them in the face. Then the <b>drifting</b> <b>smoke</b> was rent by brighter snapping flashes in quick succession, and the jarring thud of heavier reports broke through the crash of the rifles. This lasted for perhaps two minutes, and then there was by contrast a silence that was almost bewildering. It seemed emphasized when once or twice the ringing of a rifle came out of the streaks of drifting vapor that hung about the stockade.|$|R
50|$|However, {{air quality}} in Oregon {{degraded}} as plumes of <b>smoke</b> <b>drifted</b> northward instead of concentrating in the Central Valley.|$|R
