In Japan, squashes such as small C. moschata pumpkins (kabocha) are eaten boiled with sesame sauce, fried as a tempura dish, or made into balls with sweet potato and Japanese mountain yam.|$|E
5|$|It entered combat {{near the}} town of Cutigliano on 16 February. Preliminary {{defensive}} actions in mid February were followed by Encore Operation, a series of attacks in conjunction with troops of the 1st Brazilian Infantry Division, to dislodge the Germans from their artillery positions in the Northern Apennines on the border between Tuscany and <b>Emilia-Romagna</b> regions, in order to make possible the Allied advance over the Po Valley. While the Brazilian division was in charge of taking Monte Castello and Castelnuovo di Vergato, the 10th Mountain Division was responsible for the Mound Belvedere area, climbing nearby Riva Ridge during the night of 18 February and attacking mound Della Torraccia on 20 February. These peaks were cleared after four days of heavy fighting, as Axis troops launched several counterattacks in these positions.|$|E

25|$|From 1995 to 1999, Delbono {{served as}} an {{assessor}} {{for the city of}} Bologna with specific responsibility for the budget. In 2000, the newly elected President of the <b>Emilia-Romagna</b> region, Vasco Errani, named Delbono as the regional assessor for finance and organisation. In 2003 he was also named as vice-president of <b>Emilia-Romagna.</b> Following Errani's re-election in May 2005, Delbono was reconfirmed as vice-president and given additional responsibility for the region's relationship with Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{region of}} Tuscany {{includes}} seven coastal islands and is Italy's fifth largest region. It is bordered {{to the northwest}} by Liguria, the north by <b>Emilia-Romagna,</b> Umbria {{to the east and}} Lazio to the south. To the west is the Tyrrhenian Sea which gives the area a warm mediterranean climate. The terrain is quite hilly (over 68% of the terrain), progressing inward to the Apennine Mountains along the border with <b>Emilia-Romagna.</b> The hills serve as a tempering affect on the summertime heat with many vineyards planted on the higher elevations of the hillsides.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, in the <b>Emilia-Romagna</b> plain (ERP), the {{conversion}} of 15,000 hectare of agricultural soil (period 2003-2008) implied {{a net loss of}} 109,000 Mg per year of wheat, which accounts for the calories needed by 14% of ERP population (425,000 people). Such a loss in wheat production is just 0.02% of gross domestic product (GDP) of the <b>Emilia-Romagna</b> region which is actually a minor effect in financial terms. Additionally, the income from the new land use is often much higher than the one guaranteed by agriculture, {{as in the case of}} urbanisation or extraction of raw materials.|$|E
25|$|However, the Italian {{language}} maintained some importance, {{as can be}} seen by {{the fact}} that poets like Stefano Martzokis (Marzocchi was the surname of the father, an Italian from <b>Emilia-Romagna)</b> and Geranimos Markonos, the first from Corfù and the second from Cefalonia, wrote in Italian some of their poems {{in the second half of}} the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|In the Romagna {{region of}} <b>Emilia-Romagna,</b> the same grape is called Sangiovese di Romagna and is widely planted {{in all the}} Romagna region east of Bologna. Like its {{neighboring}} Tuscan brother, Sangiovese di Romagna has shown itself to spring off a variety of clones that can produce {{a wide range of}} quality—from very poor to very fine. Viticulturists have worked with Romagna vines to produce new clonal varieties of high quality (most notably the clones R24 & T19).|$|E
25|$|A general {{election}} {{was held on}} 26 October 1913, with {{a second round of}} voting on 2 November. Giolitti's Liberal Union narrowly retained an absolute majority in the Chamber of Deputies, while the Radical Party emerged as the largest opposition bloc. Both groupings did particularly well in Southern Italy, while the Italian Socialist Party gained eight seats and was the largest party in <b>Emilia-Romagna.</b> However, the election {{marked the beginning of the}} decline of Liberal establishment.|$|E
25|$|Malvasia {{wines are}} {{produced}} in Italy (including Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Lombardia, Apulia, Sicily, Lipari, <b>Emilia-Romagna,</b> and Sardinia), Slovenia, Croatia (including Istria), Corsica, the Iberian Peninsula, the Canary Islands, {{the island of}} Madeira, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Australia and Brazil. These grapes are used to produce white (and more rarely red) table wines, dessert wines, and fortified wines of the same name, or are sometimes used {{as part of a}} blend of grapes, such as in Vin Santo.|$|E
25|$|The Remedello, Rinaldone and Gaudo {{cultures}} are late Neolithic cultures of Italy, traces {{of which are}} primarily found in the present-day regions of Lombardy, Tuscany, Latium and Campania. They are sometimes described as Eneolithic cultures, due to their use of primitive copper tools. Other importants eneolithic cultures of the peninsula and the islands, often related to those previously mentioned, are the Laterza culture in Apulia and Basilicata, the Abealzu-Filigosa culture in Sardinia, the Conelle-Ortucchio culture in Abruzzo and Marche, the Serraferlicchio culture in Sicily, and the Spilamberto group in <b>Emilia-Romagna.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to {{historian}} Ezio Gray, {{the small}} communities of Venetian-speaking people in Corfu were mostly assimilated after the island {{became part of}} Greece in 1864 and especially after all Italian schools were closed in 1870. However, the Italian language maintained some importance, {{as can be seen}} by the fact that poets like Stefano Martzokis (Marzocchi was the surname of the father, an Italian from <b>Emilia-Romagna)</b> and Geranimos Markonos, the first from Corfù and the second from Cefalonia, wrote some of their poems in Italian {{during the second half of}} the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Umberto Boccioni {{was born}} on 19 October 1882 in Reggio Calabria. His father was a minor {{government}} employee, originally from the Romagna region in the north, and his job included frequent reassignments throughout Italy. The family soon relocated further north, and Umberto and his older sister Amelia grew up largely in Forlì (<b>Emilia-Romagna),</b> Genoa and finally Padua. At the age of 15, in 1897, Umberto and his father moved to Catania, Sicily, where he would finish school. Some time after 1898, he moved to Rome and studied art at the Scuola Libera del Nudo of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma.|$|E
25|$|Some {{producers}} {{will still}} use non-oak barrels, such as chestnut, juniper and cherry wood {{and may even}} blend batches of Vin Santo aged in different wood barrels together. This {{has the potential of}} giving the wines more layers of complexity {{in much the same way}} that vinegar producers in the <b>Emilia-Romagna</b> region use different wood types to add complexity to their vinegar. As a fall back, if their wines become too oxidised or do not develop the way the producer wishes, some Vin Santo may be intentionally converted into vinegar that is very desirable in the culinary market.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{research}} at the University of California-Davis and Istituto Agrario di San Michele all’Adige found Nebbiolo {{to be related to}} Piedmont by way of two aromatic grape varieties — the Freisa grape of Piedmont and the French Rhone variety Viognier. This research would further suggest a parent-offspring relationship between Nebbiolo and several Italian grapes including Freisa, Bubbierasco, Nebbiolo Rosé, and Vespolina of the Piedmont region, and the Lombardy grapes Negrara and Rossola nera. Additional DNA analysis also suggest a parent-offspring relationship with the Lombardy grape Brugnola, previously thought to be only a synonym for the <b>Emilia-Romagna</b> grape Fortana.|$|E
25|$|On 24 May 1939, the {{prototype}} Re.2000 conducted its maiden flight at Reggio Emilia, <b>Emilia-Romagna,</b> Italy, flown by Mario De Bernardi. According to Cattaneo, early flights had quickly demonstrated the type's favourable flying attitude, including good speed and high manoeuvrability. Only minor modifications were required after the {{successful completion of}} the initial factory flight test programme; these including changes to the exhaust, the lengthening of the carburetor air intake, and {{the replacement of the}} round windshield with a framed counterpart. Following the completion of armament trials at Furbara, Santa Marinella, in August 1939, {{the prototype}} was delivered to the Experimental Estblishment of the Regia Aeronautica to commence its formal evaluation.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also found}} {{elsewhere}} in Western Asia in ancient times. Peach cultivation also went from China, through Persia, and reached Greece by 300 BC. Alexander the Great introduced the fruit into Europe after he conquered the Persians. Peaches were well known to the Romans in first century AD, and were cultivated widely in <b>Emilia-Romagna.</b> Peach trees are portrayed in the wall paintings of the towns destroyed by the Vesuvius eruption of 79 AD, while the oldest known artistic representations of the fruit are in the two fragments of wall paintings, dated {{back to the first}} century AD, in Herculaneum, now preserved in the National Archaeological Museum in Naples.|$|E
25|$|Pliny the Elder wrote {{extensively}} {{about the first}} growths of Rome—most notably Falernian, Alban and Caecuban wines. Other first-growth vineyards included Rhaeticum and Hadrianum, along the Po river in what are now the modern-day regions of Lombardy and Venice respectively; Praetutium (not related to the modern Italian city of Teramo, historically known as Praetutium) along the Adriatic coast near the border of <b>Emilia-Romagna</b> and Marche; and Lunense in modern-day Tuscany. Around Rome itself were the estates of Alban, Sabinum, Tiburtinum, Setinum and Signinum. Southward to Naples were the estates of Caecuban, Falernian, Caulinum, Trebellicanum, Massicum, Gauranium, and Surrentinum. In Sicily was the first-growth estate of Mamertinum.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{decision}} to retire Digger Crown was official, {{it was reported that}} he would move to a stud farm in Italy. The owner also decided to let their own broodmares get covered by Digger Crown. Among those mares are Nealy Lobell, five times participant of Elitloppet. The stud farm that Digger Crown was installed in was Allevamento Folli near Bologna. When Swedish king Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia visited Italy in late March 2009, they received framed photographs from Vasco Errani, president of the region <b>Emilia-Romagna,</b> where Bologna is situated. One of the photos showed Digger Crown driven by Stig H. Johansson.|$|E
25|$|Barbera {{can adapt}} {{to a wide range}} of {{vineyard}} soils but tends to thrive most in less fertile calcareous soils and clay loam. Sandy soils can help limit the vigor and yields. The grape rarely thrives in very alkaline or saline soils. Like many grape varieties with a long history, the Barbera vine has seen mutation and clonal variation arise with different clones of the variety found in Piedmont, Lombardy, <b>Emilia-Romagna</b> and the Mezzogiorno. The different clones can be identified by the size and shape of their grape clusters with the smaller cluster clones producing the highest quality wine. In recent years, viticulturalists have been working with clonal selection to increase Barbera's resistance to the leafroll virus.|$|E
25|$|St. Lucy is also {{popular among}} {{children}} {{in some regions}} of North-Eastern Italy, namely Trentino, East Lombardy (Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona, Lodi and Mantua), parts of Veneto, (Verona), parts of <b>Emilia-Romagna,</b> (Piacenza, Parma, Reggio Emilia and Bologna), and all of Friuli, where {{she is said to}} bring gifts to good children and coal to bad ones the night between 12 and 13 December. According to tradition, she arrives {{in the company of a}} donkey and her escort, Castaldo. Children are asked to leave some coffee for Lucia, a carrot for the donkey and a glass of wine for Castaldo. They must not watch Santa Lucia delivering these gifts, or she will throw ashes in their eyes, temporarily blinding them.|$|E
25|$|The Ligures {{are said}} to {{have been one of the}} oldest populations in Italy and Western Europe, {{possibly}} of Pre-Indo-European origin. According to Strabo they were not Celts, but later became influenced by the Celtic culture of their neighbours, and thus are sometimes referred to as Celticized Ligurians or Celto-Ligurians. Their language had affinities with both Italic (Latin and the Osco-Umbrian languages) and Celtic (Gaulish). They primarily inhabited the regions of Liguria, Piedmont, northern Tuscany, western Lombardy, western <b>Emilia-Romagna</b> and northern Sardinia, but are believed to have once occupied an even larger portion of ancient Italy as far south as Sicily. They were also settled in Corsica and in the Provence region along the southern coast of modern France.|$|E
25|$|On 9 January 2009, Delbono {{announced}} that he would be resigning as vice-president of <b>Emilia-Romagna</b> and regional assessor in order to focus on his election campaign. Maria Giuseppina Muzzarelli was announced as his successor as vice-president on 3 February. The mayoral election was held on 21 and 22 June; Delbono's opponents included Alfredo Cazzola, the candidate of The People of Freedom and Lega Nord, and the UDC's Giorgio Guazzaloca, a former mayor of Bologna. Delbono received 49.4% of the vote in the first round, forcing a second round against Cazzola, who had received 29.1%. Delbono received 60.67% of the votes in the second round. Delbono was officially proclaimed as mayor of the city of Bologna on 25 June 2009.|$|E
25|$|Italian Stravecchio {{has been}} {{produced}} since the 1700s in the North of Italy, especially in <b>Emilia-Romagna</b> and Veneto, using grapes popular in winemaking such as Sangiovese and Grignolino. Colour, texture and finish are most resembling {{those of their}} French and Spanish counterparts. Most popular brands are Vecchia Romagna, Stravecchio Branca and Stock 84. Northern Italy is also noted since the Middle Ages for another type of wine spirit, Grappa, which is generally colourless but has some top-shelf varieties called barrique which are aged in oak casks and achieve the same caramel colour as regular brandies. There is a vast production of Stravecchios and Grappas in Italy, with more than 600 large, medium or small distilleries in operation. Ticino is also allowed to produce pomace brandy {{under the name of}} Grappa.|$|E
25|$|Outside Piedmont, Barbera {{is found}} {{throughout}} Italy, {{often as a}} component in mass vino da tavola blends. In the Lombardy region, {{it is seen as}} a varietal in Oltrepò Pavese with wines that range from slightly spritzy to semi-sparkling frizzante. Elsewhere in Lombardy it is blended with Croatina and {{as part of a larger}} blend component in the red wines of Franciacorta. Southeast of Piedmont, Barbera is found in <b>Emilia-Romagna</b> in the hills between Piacenza, Bologna and Parma. As in Lombardy, Barbera is often softened by blending with the lighter Croatina as it is in the Val Tidone region for the DOC wine of Gutturnio. In Sardinia, the grape is used around Cagliari in the wine known as Barbera Sarda and in Sicily, the grape is used in various blends under the names Perricone or Pignatello made near Agrigento. Barbera was an important grape in re-establishing the wine industry of the Apulia and Campania regions following World War II due to its high yields and easy adaption to mechanical harvesting. Today it is a permitted variety to be blended with Aglianico in the Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wine of Taurasi though it is rarely used.|$|E
25|$|In Italy it {{is called}} Calendimaggio or cantar maggio a {{seasonal}} feast held to celebrate the arrival of spring. The event {{takes its name from}} the period in which it takes place, that is, the beginning of May, from the Latin calenda maia. The Calendimaggio is a tradition still alive today in many regions of Italy as an allegory of the return to life and rebirth: among these Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, <b>Emilia-Romagna</b> (for example, is celebrated {{in the area of the}} Quattro Province or Piacenza, Pavia, Alessandria and Genoa), Tuscany and Umbria. This magical-propitiatory ritual is often performed during an almsgiving in which, in exchange for gifts (traditionally eggs, wine, food or sweets), the Maggi (or maggerini) sing auspicious verses to the inhabitants of the houses they visit. Throughout the Italian peninsula these Il Maggio couplets are very diverse—most are love songs with a strong romantic theme, that young people sang to celebrate the arrival of spring. Symbols of spring revival are the trees (alder, golden rain) and flowers (violets, roses), mentioned in the verses of the songs, and with which the maggerini adorn themselves. In particular the plant alder, which grows along the rivers, is considered the symbol of life and that's why it is often present in the ritual.|$|E

500|$|In Piedmont, {{the grape}} was {{sometimes}} {{used as an}} [...] "illegal" [...] blending partner with Nebbiolo for DOC classified Barolo {{with the intention of}} adding color and more fruit flavors. In the DOCs of Langhe and Monferrato, Cabernet is a permitted blending grape with Nebbiolo as well as Barbera. Wines that are composed of all three grape varieties are often subjected to considerable oak treatment to add a sense of sweet spiciness to compensate for the high tannins of Cabernet Sauvignon and Nebbiolo as well as the high acidity of Barbera. There are varietal styles of Cabernet Sauvignon produce in Piedmont with qualities varying depending on the location. In other regions of northern Italy, such as Lombardy, <b>Emilia-Romagna</b> and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, the grape is often blended with Merlot to produce Bordeaux style blends. In the Veneto region, Cabernet Sauvignon is sometimes blended with the main grapes of Valpolicella-Corvina, Molinara and Rondinella. In southern Italy, the grape is mostly used as a blending component with local varieties-such as Carignan in Sardinia, Nero d'Avola in Sicily, Aglianico in Campania and Gaglioppo in Calabria.|$|E
