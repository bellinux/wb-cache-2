5|$|Elegy Written <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Country</b> Churchyard is {{a poem by}} Thomas Gray, {{completed}} in 1750 and first published in 1751. The poem’s origins are unknown, but it was partly inspired by Gray’s thoughts {{following the death of}} the poet Richard West in 1742. Originally titled Stanzas Wrote <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Country</b> Church-Yard, the poem was completed when Gray was living near St Giles' parish church at Stoke Poges. It was sent to his friend Horace Walpole, who popularised the poem among London literary circles. Gray was eventually forced to publish the work on 15 February 1751, to pre-empt a magazine publisher from printing an unlicensed copy of the poem.|$|E

40|$|Technological {{progress}} {{has long been}} posited to be crucial <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country’s</b> economic growth. This paper argues that coordination failure <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country’s</b> new technology investment {{can be one of}} the barriers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country’s</b> capital accumulation and eco-nomic growth. The global game established by Morris and Shin(2000) is extended to a two-sector Overlapping Generation model where capital goods can be produced by two different technologies. The first is a conventional technology with constant re-turns, which are perfectly revealed to economic agents. The second is a new technology exhibiting increasing return to scale due to technological externalities, whose returns economic agents only have incomplete information about. Economic agents have to choose which technology to invest. My model reveals that under certain circumstances coordination failure in the capital good sector will occur and be manifested as the under-investment in the new technology. In this way, I explain how coordination fail-ure <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country’s</b> technology updating process leads to slower capital accumulation and economic growth. More interestingly, the model generates a positive correlation between economic growth and volatility through a new channel associated with coor-dination failure. Policy implications are discussed as well...|$|R

5|$|This Counter-Reformation {{offensive}} happened somewhat mysteriously <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country,</b> {{where there}} were no religious wars and the state had not cooperated with the Catholic Church in eradicating or limiting competing denominations.
