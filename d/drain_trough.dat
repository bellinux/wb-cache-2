30|$|The test {{facility}} consisted of mixer-viscometer, a gas addition system, a cooling system, a liquid charge system, cleaning solvent charge systems, and a data acquisition system. The gas charging system {{consisted of a}} pressurized gas bottle (usually 1800 psi), a pressure regulator, gas cooling bath and a mass flow meter. Operating pressure was preset using the pressure regulator. The gas through the preset pressure regulator was routed through an ice bath to cool it before it was metered. A Porter series 200 mass flowmeter was used to meter the flow rate and total volume of gas added to the vessel. The liquid charging system consisted of a simple funnel through which liquids {{were added to the}} vessel. The liquid charge could also be done using the cleaning system especially if it was desired to add liquid when the vessel was already pressurized. The cleaning and venting system consisted of a pump, bottom valve, <b>drain</b> <b>trough</b> and a vent. The pump could be used to draw liquid from the selected tank and send it to the vessel. The liquid could be a reactant or just cleaning solvent. The bottom valve was used to let in liquids into the vessel or drain from it. The <b>drain</b> <b>trough</b> was used to collect wastes after the experiments. The cooling system consisted of a chiller, the gas temperature control bath and a cooling jacket. The chiller was used to heat, cool or maintain temperature of the vessel contents. The gas temperature bath was intended to pre-cool the gas on hot days when the ambient temperatures were extremely high. The cooling jacket was the main heat exchange point between the chiller and the vessel contents. The shaft magnetic coupling was cooled to prevent heating due to friction. The mixing system consisted of a motor drive, torque sensor, and impeller. The vessel was 3.25 ″ internal diameter, 10 ″ height and rated for a maximum working pressure of 3000 psi. It was equipped with gas inlet and outlet valves, a sampling/drain valve at the bottom, pressure gage, safety/relief valve, and internal thermocouple. A ¼ HP variable speed motor was used to rotate the mixing shaft from 0 to 1900  rpm. A rotary shaft non-contact torque sensor model 01424 was used to measure torque directly from the shaft. A helical-blade impeller with two ¼ pitch blades was used for mixing vessel contents. The helical blades impeller was found to be more sensitive to viscosity change and hydrate formation during the trial tests. It also reduces the formation of a vortex during mixing. The process control and data acquisition system was developed using Factory Talk integrated suite software from Rockwell Automation. The recorded variables were shaft rotational speed, torque on shaft, chiller temperature, gas bath temperature, vessel temperature, vessel pressure, gas injection rate and totalized gas volume. A detailed description of the design, mathematical models, and calibration for this mixer-viscometer is published elsewhere (Bbosa 2015; Bbosa et al. 2017) Fig.  8 shows the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) for the setup. Figure  9 shows the schematic of the in-house mixer-viscometer used in characterization of hydrate slurries. Figure  10 shows the small-scale facility setup.|$|E
50|$|Valley steps {{may also}} have existed before the {{glaciation}} of mountainous terrain or may be formed {{without the aid of}} glacial processes, typically due to varying erosion resistance of the rock, or due to active faults. These are then only accentuated by glacial and / or fluvial erosion. Examples of this are the tobel valleys in sandstones or, often only underground, <b>draining</b> <b>troughs</b> in the limestone, where the valley step is formed by downward erosion.|$|R
2500|$|After De Brahm's departure, Demeré {{abandoned}} the original palisade design {{in favor of}} a single, more permanent palisade. [...] The walls of the palisade consisted of [...] upright logs, [...] of which extended from the ground at a 15-degree angle. [...] The interior of the fort covered approximately , and included a powder magazine, a blacksmith shop, barracks and officers' quarters, and supply buildings. The garrison built <b>drains,</b> <b>troughs</b> for salting beef, a meathouse, and a charcoal pit for the blacksmith. [...] The walls and bastions were completed by March 26, 1757. [...] Demeré reported the fort completed on May 30, 1757. [...] Governor Lyttelton named the fort after John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun, who had recently been appointed commander-in-chief of British forces in North America.|$|R
40|$|Context Pancreatic pseudocysts {{located in}} the {{mediastinum}} are rare. Symptomatic mediastinal pseudocysts can present with dysphagia, dyspnea, airway obstruction and/or cardiac tamponade. Generally, the standard approaches are surgery and external drainage. Recently, {{there have been many}} reports of successful endoscopic drainage mainly using a transpapillary technique. However, there have only been a handful of reports involving successful transmural drainage of mediastinal pseudocysts. Case report We report a case of a mediastinal pseudocyst developed after a severe blunt trauma. The patient presented with orthopnea and dysphagia. Multidetector computerized scanning of the abdomen and thorax revealed a thin, cystic, low-attenuation mass in the posterior mediastinum associated with compression of the esophagus and significant pericardial effusion. An endoscopic retrograde pancreatogram demonstrated a normal size pancreatic duct with an extravasation of contrast from the tail of the pancreas into the cyst. Ultimately, the cyst was successfully <b>drained</b> <b>trough</b> gastric fundus. Conclusion Symptomatic mediastinal pseudocysts communicating with the pericardial sac can be successfully drained using a transmural endoscopic approach without the need for surgery or external drainage...|$|R
50|$|The common {{front-loading}} commercial {{washing machine}} also differs from consumer models in its expulsion of wash and rinse water. While the consumer models pump used washer water out, allowing the waste line {{to be located}} above the washer, front loading commercial machines generally use only gravity to expel used water. A drain in the rear, {{at the bottom of}} the machine opens at the appointed time during the cycle and water flows out. This creates the need for a drainage trough behind machines, which leads to a filter and <b>drain.</b> The <b>trough</b> is usually part of a cement platform built for the purpose of raising the machines to a convenient height, and can be seen behind washers at most laundromats.|$|R
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "C" [...] grade rating. She derided the show's need to place The X-Files logo in the teaser, but ultimately {{concluded that the}} episode was a [...] "decent [...] to recap". John Keegan from Critical Myth wrote that the episode [...] "ranks right in the mediocre range" [...] and awarded it a 5 out of 10. He noted, [...] "Overall, this episode did very little for me. I’m sure that the writing staff could {{have come up with}} something better than a bad sixth season plot when the idea of a humorous ninth season episode came to the table. Is there any hope {{that there might be a}} truly memorable episode where Doggett is allowed to be amused?" [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five. The two argued that the entry was trying to [...] "be a 'Rain King' or a 'Terms of Endearment' and would like to recapture the sweet and charming feel of those early Season Six experiments." [...] However, they noted that because the show was in a different stage—Mulder and Scully were no longer the focus of the show's attention—that [...] "the same style falls flat on its face". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson complained that [...] "The X-Files is <b>draining</b> the <b>trough</b> of teenage angst again". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, felt that the teaser [...] "intrigues for a moment", but that the competing elements of [...] "quirky humour, body horror and teen love story quickly sink this disappointing outing." ...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this effort is the application at Ibiekuma watershed of lessons derived froma large number of published and ongoing research projects on dry season surface flow and sediment yield atthe International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) Ibadan in South western Nigeria. The period coveredspans September through November which generally constitute the second growing season. The effect of thespatial distribution of rainfall on runoff generation becomes increasingly important with the aridity oftenexperienced during this period and which necessitates an accurate assessment of available water, crucial to thedetermination of crop water irrigational requirement. Runoff measurement was obtained through watercollection system aligned with a Gerlach type <b>trough</b> <b>draining</b> a twin plot of 10. 71 ha within Ibiekuma watershedin south-central Nigeria. The study validated an exponential depth-averaged rainfall intensity formulationdeveloped at IITA for application in runoff and erosion modeling. There was a reasonably close agreementbetween predicted storm s kinetic energy using the exponential distribution and values obtained from theRevised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) with a coefficient of performance (CP) and an estimationdifference (ED) of 0. 81 and 7. 35 % respectively. Average depth of runoff for the entire period was less than amillimetre...|$|R
40|$|Glacially scoured {{morphology}} characterizes coastal piedmonts in the Terra Nova Bay area. Rounded mountain tops occur {{below the}} highest erosional trimlines on the flanks of glacial <b>troughs</b> <b>draining</b> the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) and in intervening reliefs. Complex older drifts rest on deglaciated areas above the younger late Pleistocene glacial drift. The authors use geomorphological and glacial geological surveys and surface exposure dating to reconstruct a local chronology of pre-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) {{variations of the}} EAIS and related outlet glaciers. Glacially transported erratics, as well as bedrock surfaces were sampled for cosmogenic-nuclide analysis (10 Be and 21 Ne). Bedrock samples show consistent 10 Be and 21 Ne exposure ages indicating exposure since at least 4 Ma with an erosion rate of about 17 cm/Ma; contrary to this, exposure ages of the older drift(s) range from 87 ka to 1352 ka. Furthermore, differences between 21 Ne and 10 Be exposure ages of the erratics indicate complex exposure histories with substantial periods of burial by cold-based ice. Rounded mountain tops represent relict landscape features eroded by the EAIS and its related inter-connected glacier system which overrode the whole coastal area; afterwards, the coastal piedmonts were repeatedly exposed and buried by ice from local and outlet glaciers which did not modify the pre- existing landscape...|$|R
40|$|Marine {{geophysical}} {{data from}} the Antarctic continental shelf indicate the former presence of ice streams that <b>drained</b> through bathymetric <b>troughs</b> during the last glacial cycle. Streaming flow is recorded by elongate subglacial bedforms, formed in {{the upper part of}} an acoustically transparent sediment layer. Cores from the layer demonstrate that it is a weak and porous subglacial till (“soft till”). Shear within the soft till was concentrated in zones that were 0. 1 – 0. 9 m thick. The soft till is a “hybrid” till, formed by a combination of subglacial sediment deformation and lodgment. The base of the soft till is marked by a strong reflector which represents the top of a denser and stronger “stiff till. ” The form of this reflector ranges from flat and continuous to deeply grooved and irregular, implying the operation of different mechanisms of sediment mobilization and incorporation into the soft till layer. The irregular form of the basal reflector is consistent with grooving, whereas the flat and continuous form is more consistent with sediment mobilization as a subglacial traction carpet related to changes in basal effective stress. Geophysical evidence for large-scale advection of the soft till, combined with evidence for deformation partitioning into relatively thin layers up to 0. 9 m thick, indicates that localized shear zones integrated to transport significant volumes of sediment beneath Antarctic paleo-ice streams...|$|R
50|$|In the present, Gareth has {{captured}} most of Rick's (Andrew Lincoln) {{group in a}} train car at Terminus. Rick encourages the group to fashion make-shift weapons as they relate their experiences that led to Terminus. Suddenly, Gareth's men throw a tear gas canister into the car, knocking most of them out. Moments later, Gareth has Rick, Daryl (Norman Reedus), Glenn (Steven Yeun), and Bob (Lawrence Gilliard Jr.) led to a butchering room, to be tied and gagged over a trough with other captives. In a disturbing methodical way, the captives are knocked out {{with a baseball bat}} and suffer the horror of having their throats slit open to drain their blood, allowing their blood from their slit throats to ooze into the <b>trough's</b> <b>drain</b> and allowing {{them to be able to}} process their bodies so that they can be feed to the people of Terminus. The first one to be slaughtered is shown to be Sam (Robin Lord Taylor), the missing survivor found by Rick and Carol. After the other three unnamed captives are slaughtered, Gareth arrives just before Glenn is about to be slaughtered to ask about a gun bag that he had seen Rick carrying, which Rick had buried in the woods outside of Terminus. Rick vows that he will kill Gareth with one of the weapons in the bag.|$|R
