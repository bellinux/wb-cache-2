5|$|Similarly, it is {{recorded}} that Saint Stepanos Monastery was first established in 649 A.D. {{and a new}} building constructed at the same location in the 10th century.

The mated pair will then guard the nest, while others will help them take care of the babies. The female lays white eggs, of which there are usually no more than three or four.

5|$|As {{the force}} which {{was sent to}} {{reinforce}} and extract the reconnaissance platoon took further casualties, the total Croatian losses in the fighting and its immediate aftermath amounted to 20 killed. The fate of the reconnaissance platoon was not immediately known to Croatian authorities or relatives of the troops for months, adding fuel to an already volatile atmosphere {{in the city of}} Bjelovar, where the 105th Brigade was originally based. This tension erupted a week later, with the blockade and capture of the JNA barracks in Bjelovar. The JNA denied it had any knowledge on the fate of the Croatian soldiers. Details of their deaths became known in December 1991. Croatian forces recaptured Kusonje on 30 December in Operation Papuk-91, and their bodies were exhumed in January 1992. Along with the soldiers, the bodies of 23 civilians were also exhumed from a mass grave in the village of Rakov Potok. The soldiers were re-interred in Bjelovar on 5 February 1992.

5|$|The Korean War was an {{escalation}} of border clashes between two rival Korean regimes (each {{of which was}} supported by external powers) with each Korean regime trying to topple the other through political and guerrilla tactics. In a very narrow sense, some may {{refer to it as}} a civil war, though many other factors were at play. After failing to strengthen their cause in the free elections held in South Korea during May 1950 and the refusal of South Korea to hold new elections per North Korean demands, the communist North Korean Army moved south on June 25, 1950 to attempt to reunite the Korean peninsula, which had been formally divided since 1948. The conflict was then expanded by the United States and the Soviet Union's involvement as part of the larger Cold War.

5|$|The mass {{deportation}} of Jews {{from the}} Warsaw Ghetto began on 22 July 1942 {{with the first}} shipment of 6,000 people. The gas chambers started operation the following morning.

No other trains were allowed to stop at the Treblinka station. The first daily trains came in the early morning, often after an overnight wait, and the second, in mid-afternoon. All new arrivals were sent immediately to the undressing area by the Sonderkommando squad that managed the arrival platform, and from there to the gas chambers. According to German records, including the official report by SS Brigadeführer Jürgen Stroop, 265,000 Jews were transported in freight trains from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>period</b> <b>from</b> 22 July to 12 September 1942.|$|E
