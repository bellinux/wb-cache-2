In addition to earlier demonstrated optical locking of diode laser to WG mode in a microsphere, we report on microsphere application in the microwave optoelectronic oscillator, OEO. In OEO, a steady-state microwave modulation of optical carrier is obtained in a closed loop including electro-optical modulator, fiber-optic delay, detector and microwave amplifier. OEO demonstrates exceptionally low phase noise (- 140 dBc/Hz at l 0 kHz from approximately 10 GHz carrier) with a fiber length approximately 2 km. Current technology allows to put {{all parts of the}} OEO, except the fiber, on the same chip. Microspheres, with their demonstrated Q equivalent to a kilometer fiber storage, can replace fiber delays in a truly integrated device. We have obtained microwave oscillation in microsphere-based OEO at 5 to 18 GHz, with 1310 nm and 1550 nm optical carrier, in two configurations: 1) with external DFB pump laser, and 2) with a ring laser including microsphere and a <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Also reported is a simple and efficient fiber coupler for microspheres facilitating their integration with existing fiber optics devices...|$|E

Influence of fluorine on the structure and luminescence properties of the glass were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, UV-visible spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectrometer. The results show that there is a new peak at 930 cm- 1 in IR spectra because of fluorine, and the intensity of the peak increases with the increases of fluorine content. The glass absorbed ultraviolet rays strongly, and transmitted light well in visible spectra region. The strongest absorption peak is around 403 nm.

40|$|Low noise optical {{frequency}} combs consist of equally spaced narrow-linewidth optical tones. They {{are useful in}} many applications including, for example, line-by-line pulse shaping, THz generation, and coherent communications. In such applications the comb spacing, extent of spectral coverage, degree of spectral flatness, optical tone power and tone-to-noise ratio represent key considerations.

Herein we suggest and demonstrate how <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> parametric <b>amplifiers</b> can be used to enhance all of these key comb parameters, allowing frequency span multiplication, low noise amplification with simultaneous comb spectrum flattening, and improvement in optical tone-to-noise ratio through various phase insensitive as well as phase sensitive implementation...|$|R
40|$|Laser {{frequency}} comb sources promise to enable precision astronomical spectroscopy at the 10 - 11 level, enabling observations aimed at locating potentially habitable planets. Frequency combs {{allow for the}} simultaneous generation of thousands of individual laser lines, each with optical frequency referenced to the SI second, and are capable of providing a bright, simple, and stable spectrum ideal for the calibration of grating-based astronomical spectrographs. In order for {{frequency comb}}s and spectrographs {{to be used in}} tandem, key technical challenges must be addressed. Most critically, it is necessary to increase the mode-spacing of the frequency comb to more than 20 GHz while simultaneously retaining the stability and broad optical bandwidth of the comb. This thesis also offers an overview of modern astronomical spectroscopy, along with a thorough discussion of the technical details of mode-locked lasers and frequency comb design. This thesis begins by presenting a frequency comb system with mode-spacing of 25 GHz suitable for the near-infrared between 1500 and 1700 nm. Examples are shown from the successful calibration of the Penn State University Pathfinder astronomical spectrograph located at the Hobby-Eberly telescope using the frequency comb system. In {{the second half of the}} thesis, the erbium-fiber frequency comb is shown to generate highly coherent, ultrafast, and bright pulses at 1050 nm. The short duration and high peak power of these pulses enable coherent and continuous extension of the comb to visible wavelengths. Next, an accurate model of a nonlinear <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> <b>amplifiers</b> is developed and tested, then applied to optimize the selection of fiber lengths in the design of ultrafast nonlinear fiber-optic systems. Finally, a broad-bandwidth optical filter cavity for the generation of a 980 — 1110 nm suitable for calibration of next-generation spectrographs was designed and tested...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{experimental}} and theoretical {{aspects of the}} phase-sensitive <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> parametric <b>amplifier</b> (FOPA) and their applications. FOPAs can be oper- ated as both phase-insensitive and phase-sensitive amplifiers (PSAs), with the latter requiring phase-locked input waves, which, until recently, has limited their practi- cal use. Based on the realization that a phase-insensitive FOPA, called the copier, can generate the phase-locked waves required, several applications of a copier-PSA configuration are proposed and demonstrated. These include phase excursion ampli- fication, ultra-low noise amplification, and, by using the copier for carrier recovery, black-box all-optical phase- and amplitude regeneration. A large part of this thesis deals with characterization of the PSA. The copier-PSA configuration is useful in this regard, since, by modulating the signal in between the copier and PSA, the phase-response of the PSA can be studied. The output signal was investigated {{both in terms of}} amplitude and phase, using a coherent receiver. Finally, methods to suppress stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in HNLFs are investigated. Without suppression, SBS will severely limit the available pump power for parametric amplification. The most common way to suppress the SBS is to increase the spectral width of the pump, but this is undesirable in many ap- plications, including phase-sensitive amplification. Therefore, the application of a strain gradient to the fibers to decrease the SBS is studied. However, such a gradi- ent also introduces an undesired dispersion variation, and this trade-off is evaluated as well. A cascade of HNLFs with strain gradients, separated by low-loss and low- dispersion isolators is proposed and evaluated, with a large increase in the SBS threshold demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|Four-wave mixing (FWM) in {{optical fibers}} {{refers to a}} {{nonlinear}} interaction among four different waves, in which the energy and wave-vector must be conserved. This requirement {{is often referred to}} as phase matching and depends strongly on the chromatic dispersion. FWM has received the attention in <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> parametric <b>amplifiers</b> due to the possibility to work in more optical regions than erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) widely used in DWDM networks. This feature of FOPAs makes it possible to utilize them for light amplification in S (1460 to 1530 nm) and L (1565 to 1625 nm) optical bands. Another application of FWM is the generation of equally-spaced products for the use in DWDM or WDM-PON. In the basic configuration, two pump lasers interfere in a low-dispersion fiber to induce a nonlinear phase modulation at the beat frequency, generating a few sidebands on both sides of the pump laser lines. As the sidebands propagate, further (cascaded) mixing occurs and, under proper phase matching conditions, hundreds of equally-spaced FWM products are generated, spanning a broad spectral region. Cascaded four-wave mixing can be used for DWDM optical carriers’ generation and modulation by information signal. This solution can be suitable for metropolitan area networks with average distances not more than 40 km. The first part of experiments consists of finding the optimal HNLF fiber length and pump powers for minimal DWDM optical carriers’ power nonuniformity and maximal power level. NHLF length and pump powers were varied with fixed step for 8 and 16 -channel systems. The second part of experiment consists of 8 and 16 -channel DWDM system performance simulation. All the generated and filtered DWDM carriers are modulated by Mach-Zehnder intensity modulator and inserted into G. 652 fiber.
