5|$|Elephant endotheliotropic herpesviruses (EEHV) or Elephantid <b>herpesvirus</b> 1' {{is a type}} of <b>herpesvirus,</b> {{which can}} cause a highly fatal hemorrhagic disease when {{transmitted}} to young Asian elephants. In African elephants, related forms of these viruses, which have been identified in wild populations, are generally benign, occasionally surfacing to cause small growths or lesions. However, some types of EEHV can cause a highly fatal disease in Asian elephants, which kills up to 80% of severely affected individuals. The disease can be treated with the rapid application of antiviral drugs, but this has only been effective in around a third of cases.|$|E

5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} {{acts as a}} barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble. DNA viruses, such as <b>herpesvirus</b> replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus, and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane. This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Herpesviruses</b> are {{not only}} {{infectious}} agents of worldwide distribution in humans, but have also been demonstrated in various non-human primates as well. Seventy-eight gibbons were subjected to serological tests by ELISA for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Results The prevalence of IgG antibodies against HSV- 1, HSV- 2, EBV and CMV was 28. 2 %, 28. 2 %, 14. 1 % and 17. 9 %, respectively. Conclusions Antigenic cross-reactivity is expected to exist between the human <b>herpesviruses</b> and gibbon <b>herpesviruses.</b> Gibbons have antibodies to human <b>herpesviruses</b> that may reflect zoonotic infection with human <b>herpesviruses</b> or infection with indigenous gibbon <b>herpesviruses.</b> Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} draw concrete conclusions from serological studies alone. Identification should be based on further isolation and molecular characterization of viruses from seropositive animals. </p...|$|R

ABSTRACT: Pneumonia {{is still}} {{a major problem in}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) -infected patients, and despite extensive investigation the aetiology remains unknown in many cases. The prevalence of the eight human <b>herpesviruses</b> was determined by polymerase chain reaction in 91 samples of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from 72 HIV-infected patients with 91 episodes of suspected pneumonia. The presence of <b>herpesviruses</b> was related to clinical and immunological findings and the prevalence of <b>herpesviruses</b> in HIV-infected patients was compared with the prevalence in BAL fluid from 50 healthy, immunocompetent individuals. Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and human herpesvirus- 8 (HHV 8) were found in 5. 5 %, 36 %, and 5. 5 % of BAL fluid samples from HIV-infected patients. No <b>herpesviruses</b> were detectable in BAL fluid from healthy, immunocompetent individuals. The <b>herpesviruses</b> occurred mainly in patients with CD 4 z counts v 2006106 L- 1. All patients with <b>herpesviruses</b> recovered without specific antiviral treatment. Two patients with HHV 8 had the diagnosis of Kaposi 9 s sarcoma. It is concluded that cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpesvirus- 8 are frequently present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from severely immunocompro-mised human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with pulmonary symptoms. In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from healthy, immunocompetent individuals, <b>herpesviruses</b> are absent. Apart from human herpesvirus- 8, the present results indicate that the <b>herpesviruses</b> do not play a serious pathogenic {{role in the development of}} pulmonary symptoms in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients...|$|R
40|$|The human <b>herpesviruses</b> are {{involved}} in a variety of diseases. Large-scale evaluation of the clinical and epidemiological importance of different <b>herpesviruses</b> requires high-throughput methods. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a method that has a multiplex capacity enabling simultaneous detection of several viruses in a single sample. PCR-based methods for the multiplex detection of all known human <b>herpesviruses</b> were developed on the MALDI-TOF MS system. A variety of 882 archival samples, including bronchoalveolar lavage, conjunctival fluid, sore secretion, blister material, plasma, serum, and urine, analyzed for <b>herpesviruses</b> using PCR-based reference methods, were used to evaluate the MALDI-TOF MS method. The overall concordance rate between the MALDI-TOF MS method and the reference methods was 95. 6 % (kappa = 0. 90). In summary, the MALDI-TOF MS method is well suited for large-scale detection of all known human <b>herpesviruses</b> {{in a wide variety of}} archival biological specimens...|$|R

5|$|People with AIDS have an {{increased}} risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer. Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20% of people with HIV. The second most common cancer is lymphoma, which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3 to 4%. Both these cancers are associated with human <b>herpesvirus</b> 8. Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human papillomavirus (HPV). Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) is also more common in those with HIV.|$|E
5|$|Double-strand DNA {{breaks in}} {{bacteria}} are repaired by the RecBCD pathway of homologous recombination. Breaks that occur {{on only one}} of the two DNA strands, known as single-strand gaps, are thought to be repaired by the RecF pathway. Both the RecBCD and RecF pathways include a series of reactions known as branch migration, in which single DNA strands are exchanged between two intercrossed molecules of duplex DNA, and resolution, in which those two intercrossed molecules of DNA are cut apart and restored to their normal double-stranded state. Homologous recombination occurs in several groups of viruses. In DNA viruses such as <b>herpesvirus,</b> recombination occurs through a break-and-rejoin mechanism like in bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, branch migration is facilitated by the RuvABC complex or RecG protein, molecular motors that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move the junction. The junction must then be resolved into two separate duplexes, restoring either the parental configuration or a crossed-over configuration. Resolution can occur in either a horizontal or vertical fashion during homologous recombination, giving patch products (if in same orientation during double strand break repair) or splice products (if in different orientations during double strand break repair). RuvA and RuvB are branch migration proteins, while RuvC is a junction-resolving enzyme.|$|E

40|$|A {{consensus}} primer PCR method which amplifies {{a region}} of herpesviral DNA-directed DNA polymerase (EC 2. 7. 7. 7) and which uses degenerate primers in a nested format was developed. Primers were designed to target sequences coding for highly conserved amino acid motifs covering {{a region of}} approximately 800 bp. The assay was applied to 22 species of <b>herpesviruses</b> (8 human and 14 animal viruses), with PCR products obtained for 21 of 22 viruses. In the process, 14 previously unreported amino acid-coding sequences from herpesviral DNA polymerases were obtained, including regions of human <b>herpesviruses</b> 7 and 8.
