50|$|In the United States, {{there are}} also tax {{advantages}} to perpetual insurance. The <b>deposit</b> <b>premium</b> does not yield any income to the insured. However, {{the expense of the}} annual premium for term homeowners insurance is eliminated. Therefore, the tax-adjusted, equivalent rate of return to the insured homeowner on the <b>deposit</b> <b>premium</b> can be calculated by taking the gross amount of money he or she needs to earn to net the amount of an annual premium for a term policy, divided by the amount of the <b>deposit</b> <b>premium.</b> For example, a house which costs $150,000 may typically be charged an annual premium of $1,000 for a term policy. That same house would likely require a $10,000 single <b>deposit</b> <b>premium</b> for a perpetual insurance policy of equivalent coverage. A person in the 28% Tax bracket would need to earn $1,389 in gross income to pay the annual premium. Since that amount no longer needs to be paid annually, the tax-adjusted, equivalent rate of return to the insured homeowner on the single <b>deposit</b> <b>premium</b> would be $1,389, less the after-tax returns that would have been earned on investing the <b>deposit</b> <b>premium</b> (or $600, assuming a 6% after-tax rate of return) divided by $10,000, in other words, 7.89%.|$|E
50|$|Perpetual {{insurance}} {{is a type}} of homeowners insurance policy written to have no term, or date, when the policy expires. From the effective start date, the coverage exists for perpetuity. The insured deposits money, called a <b>deposit</b> <b>premium,</b> with the insurer for insurance {{for the life of the}} risk. The deposit is many times larger than the cost of a non-refundable, annual premium for an equivalent policy with a one-year term. The insurer must earn enough income from investing the deposits to cover losses and operating expenses for the model to be economically viable. Upon cancellation, the insured is entitled to a full refund of the initial <b>deposit</b> <b>premium,</b> usually without interest. Perpetual insurance, first issued in the U.S. in Philadelphia in 1752, is still used for fire and homeowner's insurance.|$|E

40|$|This paper models {{the effect}} of bank {{competition}} and <b>deposit</b> insurance <b>premiums</b> on the spread between lending and deposit rates. In developing economies, low spreads do not always indicate bank efficiency; {{they may be the}} result of high risk taking.

In developing economies, such an outcome would be considered more desirable because it insulates existing financial intermediaries and investors against macroeconomic disturbances. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Co. and Center for Pacific Basin Business, Economics and Finance Research...|$|R
40|$|Increases in {{the number}} of bank {{failures}} during the 19802 ̆ 7 s put a strain on the deposit insurance fund that caused a great deal of concern about the role of regulators in the banking industry and the ability of the deposit insurance system to withstand credit crises. The FDIC raised <b>deposit</b> insurance <b>premiums</b> during this period to keep the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) solvent and also adopted a risk-based fee structure in 1994. The purpose of this dissertation is to analyze and empirically test the effects of these changes in <b>deposit</b> insurance <b>premiums</b> on the risk-taking behavior of commercial banks. Specifically, the purpose is to analyze the effects of these premium changes on bank total asset risk. ^ Theoretical evidence suggests that banks attempting to maximize the value of deposit insurance will increase asset risk when <b>deposit</b> insurance <b>premiums</b> increase. The empirical evidence does not consistently report this relationship. ^ The contribution of this research is as follows: First, this research tests the effect of changes in <b>deposit</b> insurance <b>premiums</b> on bank asset risk. Other studies have used options methodology and failure rate methodology. Studies employing a linear regression technique have used other variables, such as the percentage of deposits insured, to determine the effect of deposit insurance on bank risk. Second, this research employs a simultaneous equations methodology to reflect the simultaneity of bank input, output, and pricing decisions. Simultaneous equations methodology has been used in the banking literature to analyze the bank structure-performance issue, but has not been used specifically to determine effects of deposit insurance on bank performance. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how international depositors respond to national deposit insurance policies. Countries with explicit deposit insurance {{are found to}} be relatively attractive to international non-bank depositors. Deposit schemes characterized by coinsurance, a private administration, and a low <b>deposit</b> insurance <b>premium</b> appear to be particularly favored by these depositors. The sensitivity of non-bank deposits to deposit insurance policies opens up the possibility of international regulatory competition in this area. The EU directive on deposit insurance imposes minimum standards on national deposit insurance policies. This directive, however, is silent on several important features of deposit insurance such as the level of the <b>deposit</b> insurance <b>premium.</b> Hence, it may not preclude regulatory competition in Europe. deposit insurance, international deposit...|$|R

40|$|Assessing {{the risk}} of bank {{failures}} is the paramount concern of bank regulation. This paper argues {{that in order to}} assess the default risk of a bank, {{it is important to consider}} its financing decisions as an endogenous dynamic process. We provide a continuous-time model, where banks choose the deposit volume in order to trade off the benefits of earning <b>deposit</b> <b>premiums</b> against the costs that occur at future capital structure adjustments. The bank's asset value may suffer from shocks and follows a jump-diffusion process. Our main finding is that the dynamic endogenous financing decision introduces an important self-regulation mechanism, where it is crucial to distinguish between the diffusion risk and the jump risk component.

The estimation {{results suggest that the}} current premiums—charging 5, 5. 5, and 6 basis points per dollar of insured deposits—are too low, but largely reflect the rank orders of the risks of the insured banks. Moreover, the regression results indicate that asset volatility dominates bank size in determining the insurance premium. When the volatility risk is decomposed into two parts, credit risk significantly dominates interest-rate risk.

40|$|The primary aim of {{this paper}} to {{evaluate}} the cost of <b>deposit</b> insurance <b>premium</b> and assess moral hazard effect in the banking sector in Sudan. The analysis of moral hazard in this paper is based on two types of risks, credit default risk, measured as the ratio of non-performing loans to the total size of loans for each bank, and operational risk measured as technical inefficiency. The findings of the research indicate {{there is a positive}} association between insurance coverage premium and increase in each of these two risks, implying evidence of moral hazard effect. A policy implication of this result is that the moral hazard behavior in the banking sector can be mitigated by changing the current policy of flat rate <b>deposit</b> insurance <b>premium</b> to risk based insurance premium policy. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a method}} for estimating the value of deposit insurance based on option pricing theory. It follows the approach of Merton who viewed deposit insurance as, essentially, a put option {{on the value of}} the bank's assets. Three models are analysed, each embodying a different assumption about the bank closure rule. First, it is assumed that closures occur on given (annual) audit dates if the banks assets are less than its total insured deposits. Second, an endogenous closure rule is considered where the authorities allow the ailing bank to continue operating as long as the shareholders are willing to meet its operating losses. Third, an extension of model two is analysed where the authorities themselves can subsidise the ailing bank, thus postponing liquidation. The paper then estimates the value of deposit insurance in these three models using share price data from eight large UK banks. For each model the <b>deposit</b> insurance <b>premiums</b> vary significantly across banks and across models (though bank rankings across models was relatively stable). The paper concludes that option pricing models don't provide a useful guide for setting the level of <b>deposit</b> insurance <b>premiums.</b> They could, however, give insights as to the relative cost of deposit insurance across banks. ...|$|R
40|$|Risky {{banks that}} endanger the {{stability}} of the financial system should pay higher <b>deposit</b> insurance <b>premiums</b> than healthy banks and other financial institutions that have shown good financial performance. It is necessary, therefore, to have at least a dual fair premium rate system. In this paper, we develop a model for calculating dual fair premium rates. Our definition of a fair premium rate in this paper is a rate that could cover the operational expenditures of the deposit insuring organization, provides it with sufficient funds to enable it to pay a certain percentage share of deposit amounts to depositors in case of bank default, and provides it with sufficient funds as precautionary reserves. To identify and classify healthier and more stable banks, we use credit rating methods that employ two major dimensional reduction techniques. For forecasting non-performing loans (NPLs), we develop a model that can capture both macro shocks and idiosyncratic shocks to financial institutions in a vector error correction setting. The response of NPLs/loans to macro shocks and idiosyncratic innovations shows that using a model with macro variables only is insufficient, as it is possible that under favorable economic conditions some banks show negative performance or vice versa. Our final results show that stable banks should pay lower <b>deposit</b> insurance <b>premium</b> rates...|$|R

This paper introduces an incentive compatible mechanism such that fair (risk-based) <b>deposit</b> insurance <b>premiums</b> can be achieved under adverse selection.

Does the economic {{value of the}} deposit account differ from the face value and can we reliably measure it? To what extent is the economic value sensitive to yield curve changes? In this paper, we try to answer the above questions. The valuation is performed on yield curve, deposit rate and deposit balance data between December 1994 and June 2005 for a sample of Belgian bank retail savings deposits accounts. We find that the <b>deposits</b> <b>premium</b> component of Belgian savings deposits is economically and statistically significant, though sensitive to assumptions about servicing costs and outstanding balances average decay rates. We also find that deposit liability values depreciate significantly when market rates increase, thereby offsetting some of the value losses on the asset side.
