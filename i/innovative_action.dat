2500|$|In 1988, Arsys Software's Star Cruiser was an <b>innovative</b> <b>action</b> RPG {{released}} for the PC-8801. It was {{notable for}} being an early example of an RPG with fully 3D polygonal graphics, combined with first-person shooter gameplay, which would occasionally switch to space flight simulator gameplay when exploring outer space with six degrees of freedom. All the backgrounds, objects and opponents in the game were rendered in 3D polygons, many years before they were widely adopted by the video game industry. The game also emphasized storytelling, with plot twists and extensive character dialogues, taking place in a futuristic science fiction setting. It won the 1988 Game of the Year awards from the Japanese computer game magazines [...] and [...] Star Cruiser was later ported to the Mega Drive console in 1990. Another 1988 release, Last Armageddon, produced for the PC-8801 and later ported to the PC Engine CD and NES consoles in 1990, featured a unique post-apocalyptic storyline set in a desolate future where humanity has become extinct and the protagonists are demon monsters waging war against an alien species. The Scheme, released by Bothtec for the PC-8801 in 1988, was an action RPG with a similar side-scrolling open-world gameplay to Metroid. That same year, [...] introduced the unique ability to transform into a monster, which allows the player to both scare human non-player characters for unique dialogues as well as interact with all the monsters. This is a recurring highlight in the series, offering the player insight into the enemies, to an extent that very few other games allow to this day. Also that same year, War of the Dead Part 2 for the MSX2 and PC-88 abandoned certain RPG elements of its predecessor, such as random encounters, and instead adopted more action-adventure elements from Metal Gear while retaining the horror atmosphere of its predecessor.|$|E

40|$|Several {{empirical}} {{works have}} shown the robust and positive relation between growth and innovation at macroeconomic level and between firm economic performance and innovation at microeconomic level. However, the economists have had less opportunities to study such linkages during severe global downturns of the economic cycle. Moreover, the present disruptive economic downturn has forced the firms to implement survival strategies. One of such strategic behaviour regards the way of intervention on product and process areas through <b>innovative</b> <b>actions.</b> Focusing the attention on the micro level, the present work provides an empirical analysis {{on the basis of}} more than 500 Italian manufacturing firms located in Emilia-Romagna region, with the aim of disentangling the relations between pre-crisis innovation strategies and firm economic performance during the crisis as well as the linkages between the <b>innovative</b> <b>actions</b> taken to react to the recession’s challenges and the economic performance in the recession. The results suggest the existence of strong relationships between past innovative activities and the capacity to react to the challenges brought by the crisis through <b>innovative</b> <b>actions</b> along product, process and organization/HRM dimensions, although the role of complementarities among past innovative activities doe...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{regional}} economies to withstand competition and to manage change {{is related to}} their capacity to innovate. The increasing importance of knowledge in determining economic performance places innovation high on the regional development agenda. The Regional Programmes of <b>Innovative</b> <b>Actions</b> {{are seen as a}} catalyst which gives regions an opportunity to try more adventurous actions that are often otherwise postponed or ignored. It is particularly important for the least-developed regions, such as, among others, the thirteen Greek regions, that they have the chance to experiment in fields outside the norm of their structural funds programmes and develop greater co-operation and networking with more developed regions. The second publication of the Greek Regional Programmes of <b>Innovative</b> <b>Actions,</b> entitled Regional Innovation Excellence in Greece, deals thoroughly with the programmes themselves, notably by presenting a comprehensive inventory of each individual action as well as attempting to produce their first clustering categorisation. Clusters represent a different way of dividing the regional economy. Cluster policy is a ‘mature’ policy area in some countries, and one that is emerging in others. ...|$|R
50|$|Calvin M. Bower, Professor Emeritus of the University of Notre Dame and {{currently}} {{a researcher at}} the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities, was the Artistic Director of Schola Antiqua from its inception until 2008. Bower specializes {{in the history of the}} medieval sequence. Consequently, Schola Antiqua's programs in the early years often included Notker’s sequences and other monophonic settings. The ensemble’s second Artistic Director, Michael Alan Anderson, more broadly researches the role of plainchant and polyphony in devotion, ritual, and political cultures of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. Some of Anderson's research agenda is likewise embedded in the ensemble’s past and current programming. He is the winner of Chorus America's Louis Botto Award for <b>Innovative</b> <b>Action</b> and Entrepreneurial Zeal for his work with Schola Antiqua.|$|E

He further admitted that the full motion video cutscenes have some value. He acknowledged that the controls are imperfect but said they become easier with practice. GamePros brief review, however, argued that [...] "Battlemorph provides below-average terrain-skimming shooting in a typical polygon environment and features really poor control. While the tunnel and underwater areas refresh this tedious game, the dismal one-color landscapes are the same as those in half of the Jaguar games out there." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} university-community {{relations}} in 20th century America {{was characterized by}} periods of optimism and <b>innovative</b> <b>action</b> followed by disillusionment. During the years when cities were rapidly growing {{as a result of}} immigration and migration from the countryside, academics contributed to the search for solutions to urban problems and {{played a major role in}} the Progressive movement. After World War I, research became increasingly esoteric, its focus shifting to national and international issues, until, with the 1960s, efforts to find accommodations with a restive local community spawned a wide variety of new programs. The advent of new technology appeared to satisfy needs for both research and jobs, but it also produced new frictions. In the present decade, new models for university-community partnerships and cooperation have evolved and civic engagement has been linked more closely with the educational mission of the urban and metropolitan university.|$|E

In 2008, Miller was honored with the Louis Botto Award for <b>Innovative</b> <b>Action</b> and Entrepreneurial Zeal from Chorus America, given in recognition of his efforts in developing Chicago a cappella as a professional vocal ensemble. Matthew Greenberg, a founding singer in the ensemble, joined the administrative staff in 1995 and has been recognized nationally {{in his role as}} Chicago a cappella’s Executive Director. Chicago a cappella’s audiences and activity have grown ever since its founding, and the group now presents a series of concert programs each year in Chicago, Evanston, Naperville, and Oak Park, IL, performing most usually with an ensemble of nine singers. After a successful five years of service, Patrick Sinozich was designated Music Director Emeritus in 2012, and Chicago a cappella will welcome Guest Music Directors for three concert programs in 2012-13, with Artistic Director Jonathan Miller returning to direct the season-opening concert in October 2012.|$|E

The NCC {{was established}} to be [...] "a Multidisciplinary Centre - deliberately based outside London - where work on improving all aspects of childhood could be pursued. Sometimes {{this was to be}} through research, sometimes through <b>innovative</b> <b>action,</b> sometimes by informing the media or by discussing progress with politicians, administrators, or members of the many professions that touch on the field." [...] Brian and NERDT enlisted the expertise of Hazel Wigmore, as Director (from setting up to 2001), and two other teachers who were trained with her at the then Huddersfield Polytechnic, John Cashman and Raymond Ball. Brian Jackson was a man of great energy who worked relentlessly to further various causes connected with the education and welfare of children. His imaginative and innovative ideas, combined with Hazel Wigmore's relentless energy and organisational skills,enabled the setting up of unusual practical schemes and research projects, the findings of which were disseminated nationally and internationally. The first home of the National Children's Centre was in Huddersfield at Longroyd Bridge, in a 1940s building (now listed) which straddles the river on long legs and was adjacent to a bus depot and workshop.|$|E
