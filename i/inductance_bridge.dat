40|$|A new superconducting accelerometer, {{capable of}} {{measuring}} both linear and angular accelerations, is under {{development at the}} University of Maryland. A single superconducting proof mass is magnetically levitated against gravity or any other proof force. Its relative positions and orientations {{with respect to the}} platform are monitored by six superconducting <b>inductance</b> <b>bridges</b> sharing a single amplifier, called the Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID). The six degrees of freedom, the three linear acceleration components and the three angular acceleration components, of the platform are measured simultaneously. In order to improve the linearity and the dynamic range of the instrument, the demodulated outputs of the SQUID are fed back to appropriate levitation coils so that the proof mass remains at the null position for all six <b>inductance</b> <b>bridges.</b> The expected intrinsic noise of the instrument is 4 x 10 (exp - 12) m s(exp - 2) Hz(exp - 1 / 2) for linear acceleration and 3 x 10 (exp - 11) rad s(exp - 2) Hz(exp - 1 / 2) for angular acceleration in 1 -g environment. In 0 -g, the linear acceleration sensitivity of the superconducting accelerometer could be improved by two orders of magnitude. The design and the operating principle of a laboratory prototype of the new instrument is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a substrate independent empirical formulation for the <b>bridge</b> <b>inductance</b> of inductively tuned RF MEMS shunt switches, allowing a systematic design approach to tune their isolation bands. Inductive tuning of RF MEMS switches {{is achieved by}} inserting recesses in the ground plane and meanders to the bridges, allowing the tuning of the isolation band of the switch from the X-band to the mm-wave band. The <b>bridge</b> <b>inductance</b> is first extracted from parametric EM simulations of the RF MEMS shunt switches and then fitted to the proposed formulations using empirical coefficients. The accuracy of the formulations is verified with the measurements on the switches that are fabricated using an in-house surface micromachining RF MEMS process on a 500 -µm thick glass substrate. Measurement results verify that the <b>bridge</b> <b>inductances</b> can {{be determined by the}} provided empirical formulation. 1...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} method of observing adsorptive length changes in porpoise rods {{by means of}} a linear differential transformer and <b>inductance</b> <b>bridge</b> has been developed. The method was used to observe the adsorptive length change behaviour of rods of kaolinite and Vycor, when they were exposed to the vapours of H₂O, CH₃OH, C₂H₅OH, CHCl₃, CCl₄, and C₆H₆. Spreading pressure – length change slopes were measured and the variation in their values for a solid at a particular temperature discussed in terms of the structures of the absorbed phases. An attempt was made to measure the strength of the adsorbate-adsorbent and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions thermodynamically, using the BET c parameter. The effect of particle alignment during extrusion in kaolinite rods was studies by means of ultrasonic and x-ray diffraction techniques...|$|E
40|$|The superconducting {{transition}} of electrodeposited Tc films was studied {{by measuring the}} complex susceptibility of specimens. The electrodeposition was carried out under several different conditions and the preparation of metallic Tc by this method was established. For the measure-ment of complex susceptibility, a Hartshorn-type mutual <b>inductance</b> <b>bridge</b> •was constructed. The measuring system involving the bridge was examined by using Sn and Pb films, and, {{was found to have}} the sensitivity of 0. 05 pH. It has been revealed that the structural situation of specimens is well reflected in the observed complex susceptibility and that the information on dislocation and homogeneity in the sample can be obtained from the measurement. Some attempts to prepare Re samples were also performed by means of electrodeposition. KEY WORDS Superconductor / Technetium / Rhenium / Transition temperature...|$|E

40|$|It {{was felt}} that a bridge was missing from the family of bridges in the {{literature}} dealing with the comparison of capacitance, mutual inductance and/or self <b>inductance.</b> This new <b>bridge</b> would bear a similar relationship to Maxwell Abridge that the Heydweiller did to the Owen. Reference to Appendix I will show these relationships. To keep the study to reasonably comprehensive limits particular attention is {{to be paid to}} the comparison of the new bridge with Maxwell's bridge. Frequently the effects of quadrature components of bridge units on the final balance conditions are glossed over in the study of simple bridges in elementary work. These components do not always affect, appreciably, the results for moderately accurate work. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Dual Active Bridge (DAB) {{converters}} {{offer an}} unmatched capability to transfer energy {{in either direction}} between two DC sources, especially when they are operated under Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) conditions. However, the parasitic commutation <b>inductance</b> within the <b>bridge</b> phase leg devices can still lead to significant energy losses at device turn-off despite operating under ZVS conditions. These losses can become significant when one bridge has a low DC bus voltage and a consequential high magnitude output current. This paper shows how harmonic decomposition analysis {{can be used to}} constrain the bridge circulating currents to their minimum possible values at the point of phase leg commutation while still ensuring that ZVS operation is maintained. This can be used to improve the overall DAB performance under low voltage, high current operating conditions of one DC port. The capability of the theoretical analysis process is confirmed by matching experimental results for a reference DAB system...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} design and {{operation}} of a device for ac magnetic susceptibility measurements that can operate down to 1 mK. The device, a modification of the standard mutual <b>inductance</b> <b>bridge,</b> is designed with detailed consideration of the thermalization and optimization of each element. First, {{in order to reduce}} local heating, the primary coil is made with superconducting wire. Second, a low-temperature transformer which is thermally anchored to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator, is used to match the output of the secondary coil to a high-sensitivity bridge detector. The careful thermal anchoring of the secondary coil and the matching transformer is required to reduce the overall noise temperature and maximize sensitivity. The sample is immersed in liquid (3) He to minimize the Kapitza thermal resistance. The magnetic susceptibility of several magnetic compounds, such as the well-known spin gap compound NiCl(2) - 4 SC(NH(2)) (2) and other powdered samples, have been successfully measured to temperatures well below 10 mK.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of {{induction}} bridges used in low temperature physics. In Part 1 the design of a mutual <b>inductance</b> <b>bridge</b> of the Hartshorn type is discussed. This design is based on a critical analysis of impurity effects of the different parts of the Hartshorn bridge. With this equipment frequencies up to 0. 5 MHz can be used. Two methods have been developed to examine the secondary signal. In one of these use {{has been made of}} AD conversion techniques. In the other one, the secondary signal, produced by a superconducting sample, which is generally distorted, is analysed by using a Fourier expansion. In Part 2 equipment is described which enables us to measure the phase and amplitude of the harmonics of the output signal of the bridge. For synchronous detection a reference signal of the same frequency of the harmonic of interest is required. This reference signal is generated from the input signal of the bridge by means of a digital frequency multiplier with programmable multiplication factor N. In Part 3 some experimental results, showing the possibilities of the equipment, on some superconductors are presented...|$|E
