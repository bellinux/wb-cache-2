40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the current age-related hepatitis A virus (HAV) seroprevalance, vaccination status of children and to evaluate the epidemiological shift in HAV serostatus living in Tekirdağ, which is located in Thrace region, the European part of Turkey. Methods: Children 6 months- 12 years of age with simple health problems were included. Blood samples were studied for HAV IgM and IgG collectively. A questionnaire addressing several characteristics of subjects was administered to obtain basic descriptive data on HAV epidemiology. Vaccination status of the children was recorded according to the immunization cards. Findings: The overall anti-HAV IgM and anti-HAV IgG prevalance in children aged 6 months – 12 years was 3. 3 % and 25. 4 % respectively. Maximum hepatitis A IgM positivity was in the 7 - 12 years age group 4. 8 % (n= 12; P< 0. 001) and maximum <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> <b>IgG</b> positivity in the same age group was 34 % (n= 85; P< 0. 001). HAV vaccination rate among patients aged more than 2 years was 11. 03 %. HAV IgG seroprevalance was higher in children of low monthly income families (36. 1 %, n= 78; P< 0. 001) than in the intermediate (17 %, n= 31) and high income families (11. 1 %, n= 6). Conclusion: These results indicate a shift in Hepatitis A seroprevalance when compared with the previous studies. As HAV infection in childhood is decreasing, the pool of susceptible adolescents and young adults is increasing. Introduction of hepatitis A vaccination into the national immunization schedule of Turkey should be considered...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> {{infection}} {{is an important}} public health problem in our country. However, its endemicity pattern has been changing in recent years both worldwide and in our country. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the seroprevalence of <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> infection among 2 - 6 year-old children of low socioeconomic class families.

40|$|<b>Hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> virus (HAV) is {{a common}} cause of {{hepatitis}} worldwide. The mode of transmission is generally person to person or by oral intake after fecal contamination of skin or mucous membranes; less commonly, there is fecal contamination of food or water. This infection is endemic in developing countries including Thailand (prevalence about 1. 1 % in general population) (1). One of the several risk groups is medical students who are exposed to this infection during their routine daily practice. Here, the author performed a study to assess the prevalence of medical students who were not sufficiently vaccinated against this occupationally relevant infectious disease in a Thai medical school using questionnaire survey. One hundred and fifty-four students of the Chulalongkorn medical school in Thailand (age between 18 - 21 years old, 89 females and 65 males) who enrolled in this study completed a questionnaire on demographic data and their vaccination status to <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A.</b> The questionnaire is already approved for the validity and reliability in the previous pilot questionnaire testing. Interestingly, the reported rate of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccination among these medical students was only 3. 9 % (6 / 154 cases) which is considerably very low comparing {{to a recent report}} from Germany (reported rate of vaccination: 59. 5 %- 64. 1 %), where the prevalence of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> infection is lower (2). A possible explanation for the low prevalence in this work is that the vaccination for <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> is rather new in Thailand and is not already included in the national expanded program on immunization. According to this work, although medical students are at high risk of being exposed to <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> infection (3) they have a low rate of vaccination. However, because vaccination for <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> depends on the immunity of the population in that area, anti-hepatitis <b>A</b> <b>IgG</b> should be confirmed before vaccination starts. Concerning the studied medical students, none knew their own immunity status. In addition, anti-hepatitis <b>A</b> <b>IgG</b> test costs about 12 US dollars which is nearly as expensive as <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccine (about 16 US dollar). Therefore, it is not suggested to perform <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> antibody testing. Although the cost of vaccine is not too much, it seems that most students, who have no salary, {{might not be able to}} afford it. However, <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccination is not generally indicated in developing countries, such as Thailand, where due to high endemicity, most children become infected in their early childhood and therefore the disease is uncommon. The recommendation for the health care worker is still set (4). In addition, medical students might be the forgotten and neglected group. In order to increase the rate of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccination among medical students, they should be provided with free of charge vaccination early before the beginning of their medical training...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the impact {{and effectiveness of}} risk-group vaccination against <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> targeted at migrant children living {{in a country with}} low endemicity of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A.</b> METHODS: Retrospective population based data analysis. Routinely collected data on <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> incidence in migrant children and other risk groups in Amsterdam from 1 January 1992 to 2004 were analyzed and related to exposure, immunity and vaccination coverage in migrant children. RESULTS: The overall <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> incidence in Amsterdam declined after a pediatric vaccine was introduced in 1997.

Eight members of an extended family developed <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> following the arrival of an asymptomatic infant from Ethiopia who {{was brought to the}} United States by an adoption agency. Two children in the family attended an elementary school where five additional cases of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> were subsequently identified. Only three (1 %) of 208 students at the school had previously been immunized against <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A.</b> This outbreak highlights the need to immunize household members and other close contacts of families adopting children from countries where <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> is endemic, as well as all children at one year of age. <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> Outbreak from an International Adoptee 64...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ribavirin}} on fetal Rhesus monkey kidney cells (FRhK- 4) acutely or chronically infected with <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> virus was studied. The effect of ribavirin on <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> virus yield as detected by radioimmunoassay in acutely infected FRhK- 4 cells {{was dependent on}} <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> virus inoculum dose. Treatment with 100 μg/mL ribavirin completely inhibited <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> virus growth in cultures infected with 100 to 800 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50) <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> virus, but inocula of 800 to 1600 TCID 50 resulted in limited production of virus. The effect was time dependent and required more than 96 h of treatment to inhibit the virus completely. Ribavirin was less effective in treating cells persistently infected with <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> virus, although there was significant inhibition of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> virus (82 %) in persistently infected cells as well. Ribavirin had some inhibitory effect on cell growth; treatment with 25, 50 or 100 μg/mL ribavirin reduced cell growth by approximately 0, 20 and 40 %, respectively...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{assess the}} population-level impact and {{cost-effectiveness}} of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccination {{programs in the}} United States. MethodsWe developed an age-structured population model of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> transmission dynamics to evaluate two policies of administering <b>a</b> two-dose <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccine to children aged 12 to 18 months: 1) universal routine vaccination as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in 2006 and 2) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’s previous regional policy of routine vaccination of children living in states with high <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> incidence. Inputs {{were obtained from the}} published literature, public sources, and clinical trial data. The model was fitted to <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> seroprevalence (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II and III) and reported incidence from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (1980 – 1995). We used a societal perspective and projected costs (in 2013 US $), quality-adjusted life-years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and other outcomes over the period 2006 to 2106. ResultsOn average, universal routine <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccination prevented 259, 776 additional infections, 167, 094 outpatient visits, 4781 hospitalizations, and 228 deaths annually. Compared with the regional vaccination policy, universal routine <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccination was cost saving. In scenario analysis, universal vaccination prevented 94, 957 infections, 46, 179 outpatient visits, 1286 hospitalizations, and 15 deaths annually and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $ 21, 223 /quality-adjusted life-year when herd protection was ignored. ConclusionsOur model predicted that universal childhood <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccination led to significant reductions in <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> mortality and morbidity. Consequently, universal vaccination was cost saving compared with a regional vaccination policy.

40|$|<b>Hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> {{is caused}} by <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> virus (HAV). Transmission occurs by the fecal-oral route, either by direct contact with an HAV-infected person or by {{ingestion}} of HAV-contaminated food or water. Foodborne or waterborne <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> outbreaks are relatively uncommon in the United States. However, food handlers with <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> are frequently identified, and evaluation {{of the need for}} immunoprophylaxis and implementation of control measures are a considerable burden on public health resources. In addition, HAV-contaminated food may be the source of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> for an unknown proportion of persons whose source of infection is not identified. FEATURES OF <b>HEPATITIS</b> <b>A</b> <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> virus (HAV) is classified as a picornavirus. Primates are the only natural host [1]. There is only 1 HAV serotype, and immunity after infection is lifelong [2]. After ingestion, uptake in the gastrointestinal tract, and subsequent replication in the liver, HAV is excreted in bile, and high concentrations are found in stool specimens. Transmission occurs by the fecal-oral route, either by direct contact with an HAV-infected person or by ingestion of HAV-contaminated food or water. The me...|$|R
