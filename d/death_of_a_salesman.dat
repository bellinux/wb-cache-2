5|$|In {{the spring}} of 2012, Hoffman made his final stage appearance, {{starring}} as Willy Loman in a Broadway revival of <b>Death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Salesman.</b> Directed by Mike Nichols, the production ran for 78 performances and was the highest-grossing show in the Ethel Barrymore Theatre's history. Many critics felt that Hoffman, at 44, was too young {{for the role of}} 62-year-old Loman, and Chris Jones of the Chicago Tribune felt that the character had been interpreted poorly. Hoffman admitted that he found the role difficult, but he nevertheless earned his third Tony Award nomination.|$|E

A few months later, Brooks mentioned that he was working on a screenplay called Springtime for Hitler, for which he thought Wilder would be perfect in the role of Leo Bloom. Brooks elicited a promise from Wilder that he would check with him before making any long-term commitments. Months went by, and Wilder toured the country with different theatre productions, participated in a televised CBS presentation of <b>Death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Salesman,</b> and was cast for his first role in a film—a minor role in Arthur Penn's 1967 Bonnie and Clyde. After three years of not hearing from Brooks, Wilder was called for a reading with Zero Mostel, who was to be the star of Springtime for Hitler and had approval of his co-star. Mostel approved, and Wilder was cast for his first leading role in a feature film, 1968's The Producers.|$|E

25|$|Arthur Asher Miller (October 17, 1915– February 10, 2005) was an American playwright, essayist, {{and figure}} in twentieth-century American theater. Among his most popular plays are All My Sons (1947), <b>Death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Salesman</b> (1949), The Crucible (1953) and A View from the Bridge (1955, revised 1956). He also wrote several screenplays and was most noted {{for his work}} on The Misfits (1961). The drama <b>Death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Salesman</b> has been {{numbered}} on the short list of finest American plays in the 20th century alongside Long Day's Journey into Night and A Streetcar Named Desire.|$|E
25|$|In <b>Death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Salesman</b> – {{originally}} entitled “The Inside of His Head” – Miller brilliantly {{solves the}} problem of revealing his main character's inner discord, rendering Willy Loman as solid as the society in which he tries to sell himself. Indeed, many critics believe that Miller has never surpassed his achievement in this play, which stands as his breakthrough work, distinguished by an extremely long Broadway run, by many revivals, and by many theater awards, including the Pulitzer Prize in 1949. <b>Death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Salesman</b> seems destined to remain an American classic and a standard text in American classrooms.|$|E
