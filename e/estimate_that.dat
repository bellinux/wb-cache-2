5|$|After the {{valuable}} coins were issued, Lépes demanded the tithe {{for the previous}} years in one sum. Historians <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> the peasant families were required to pay six to nine gold florins, although {{the value of an}} average peasant lot was only about 40 florins. Most peasants were unable to pay this amount, especially because they also had to pay the seigneurial taxes to the owners of their parcels.|$|E
5|$|Airport {{officials}} <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> {{around a}} third of airline tickets purchased by area residents are for travel from other airports. Competition includes Piedmont Triad International Airport near Greensboro, North Carolina, as an alternate and others farther away which have service from Southwest Airlines or international flights. However, aviation industry consultant Michael Boyd compared Roanoke's level of air service favorably to similarly sized cities.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> the Solar System {{as we know}} {{it today}} will not change {{drastically}} until the Sun has fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning its evolution from the main sequence of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and into its red-giant phase. Even so, the Solar System will continue to evolve until then.|$|E

5|$|Baltic German {{astronomer}} Hermann Struve {{used the}} observed {{changes in the}} orbits of the Martian moons to determine the gravitational influence of the planet's oblate shape. In 1895, he used this data to <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> the equatorial diameter was 1/190 larger than the polar diameter. In 1911, he refined the value to 1/192. This result was confirmed by American meteorologist Edgar W. Woolard in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Downcutting and canyon {{widening}} continue {{today as}} the process of erosion continues to try to reduce the topography to sea level. In 1998 a flash flood temporarily increased the Virgin River's flow rate from 200 to 4,500ft³/s (6 to 125m³/s). Geologists <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> the Virgin River can cut another thousand feet (300m) before it loses the ability to transport sediment to the Colorado River to the south. However, additional uplift will probably increase this figure.|$|E
5|$|Granny {{was also}} used as a focal point of {{environmental}} efforts {{that resulted in the}} Endangered Species Act protections for orca. Environmentalists <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> Granny may have had a PCB load of up to 100 parts per million, and that her descendants' reproductive systems may have been damaged by exposure to pollution. Additionally, declining West Coast salmon populations put Granny and her family at risk.|$|E

30|$|Regarding {{the means}} of the {{perceived}} distances, we first noticed that for every study site the perceived distances are higher than the objective ones. In Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, every respondent lived in areas exposed to coastal flooding according to the hazards maps but they perceived living on average at 980  m from areas exposed to coastal flooding. Respondents in Barneville-Carteret perceived living on average at 245  m from exposed areas, that being 2.6 times more than the average objective distance. 27.2 % of the respondents (25 individuals) who actually lived in exposed areas (according to experts’ hazard maps) <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> they lived in exposed areas. 9.8 % of the respondents (9 individuals) who didn’t actually live in exposed areas <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> they didn’t live in exposed areas. 9.8 % (9 individuals) who didn’t actually live in exposed areas <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> they lived in exposed areas.

5|$|Regardless of {{the outcome}} of the {{continental}} migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted.|$|E

50|$|The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> {{enacting}} H.R. 4193 {{would not}} affect direct spending. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> {{there could be}} a small revenue effect because enacting the bill might change the number of federal employees who choose to contribute to the TSP, thus modifying their total tax liability. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. However, JCT <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> any revenue effects would be negligible.|$|R

5|$|Accounts vary, but historians <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> {{by spring}} 1903, between 700 and 1,000 men {{arrived in the}} Tanana Valley. This put an {{enormous}} strain on Barnette's stock of food, which rapidly rose in price with demand. Miners objected to Barnette charging $12 per bag of flour and requiring them to buy cases of canned food. They gathered outside his store and demanded he lower his prices or they would burn it down. He responded that he had riflemen inside the building, and both groups reached a compromise. Shortly afterward, Barnette headed south with his wife on a dog team, intending to gather investors to purchase more supplies.|$|E
5|$|Although JNA {{losses were}} {{undoubtedly}} substantial, the exact numbers are unclear {{because of a}} lack of official data. The JNA officially acknowledged 1,279 killed in action, including 177 officers, during the entire war in Croatia. According to Tus, the JNA's Novi Sad corps alone lost 1,300 soldiers during the campaign in eastern Slavonia. He extrapolates from this to <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> between 6,000 and 8,000 soldiers and volunteers died in eastern Slavonia, with the loss of 600 armoured vehicles and heavy weapons and over 20 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Another {{person who}} {{took up the}} {{initiative}} in the late 1950s was Rangvald Iversen, who was plant manager at Norwegian Talc at Knarrevik. The plant had large costs freighting their products across the sound on the Alvøy–Brattholmen Ferry. In 1958, he took the initiative to conduct a traffic count, which along with estimates of increased traffic from other places that had replaced a ferry with a bridge, would give estimates for the revenue from tolls. Norwegian Talc also paid for a draft plan for a bridge. In 1959, Iversen presented an <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> a bridge would cost NOK15.5 million, and on 19 December 1959, the council voted unanimously to recommend that a committee be established to continue work on the bridge plans.
