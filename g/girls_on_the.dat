25|$|Tatsuya is {{the main}} male protagonist in the story. He is very {{knowledgeable}} about {{the moon and the}} Kingdom of Sphere because he has been interested in it since he was very young.

At the general meeting he faced criticism for the bikini-clad <b>girls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cover of Town magazine, which were considered risqué at the time, but was selected after a stirring speech to the assembled 500 members of the local Conservative Association.

25|$|Since {{his death}} in 1973 and the {{discovery}} of his magnum opus, and especially since the 1990s, {{there have been many}} references in popular culture to Darger's work by other visual artists including, but not limited to, artists of comics and graphic novels; numerous popular songs; a 1999 book-length poem, <b>Girls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Run, by John Ashbery; a multi-player online game, Sissyfight 2000, and a 2004 multimedia piece by choreographer Pat Graney incorporating Darger images.

25|$|One {{of those}} {{irregularities}} {{is related to}} juror No. 12. During the trial he violated his oath on several occasions and was referred to by Anand Jon’s lawyers as hardly an impartial juror. Although prohibited, juror No. 12 had discussed the case with his tenant and told her he felt the <b>girls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stand all {{seemed to have the}} same or similar stories, and that he was under the impression they had all collaborated. Due to his fellow jurors’ anger towards him, juror No. 12 felt he was pressured to give a verdict that he didn’t want to give. Also, during deliberations, several jurors complained to the judge that juror No. 12 was refusing to properly deliberate and had made up his mind about the evidence. Although the jury foreman had requested that juror No. 12 be removed for refusal to deliberate, it was denied by Judge Wesley.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, Charlotte had an {{idea that}} would place all the {{advantages}} on her side. On advice from her father and friends, she thought {{that she and her}} sisters had the intellectual capacity to create a school for young girls in the parsonage where their Sunday School classes took place. It was agreed to offer the future pupils the opportunity of correctly learning modern languages and that preparation for this should be done abroad, which led to a further decision. Among the possibilities Paris and Lille were considered, but were rejected due to aversion to the French. Indeed, the French revolution and the Napoleonic wars had not been forgotten by the Tory spirited and deeply conservative <b>girls.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> recommendation of a pastor based in Brussels, who wanted to be of help, Belgium was chosen, where they could also study German, and music.
