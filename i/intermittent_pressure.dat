60|$|As {{with plants}} so with animals, we find {{good reason for}} {{inferring}} that while the specialities of the tegumentary parts must be ascribed to the natural selection of favourable variations, their most general traits are due to the direct action of surrounding agencies. Here we come upon the border of those changes which are ascribable to use and disuse. But from this class of changes we may fitly exclude those in which the parts concerned are wholly or mainly passive. A corn and a blister will conveniently serve to illustrate {{the way in which}} certain outer actions initiate in the superficial tissues, effects of very marked kinds, which are related neither {{to the needs of the}} organism nor to its normal structure. They are neither adaptive changes nor changes towards completion of the type. After noting them we may pass to allied, but still more instructive, changes. Continuous pressure on any portion of the surface causes absorption, while <b>intermittent</b> <b>pressure</b> causes growth: the one impeding circulation and the passage of plasma from the capillaries into the tissues, and the other aiding both. There are yet further mechanically-produced effects. That the general character of the ribbed skin on the under surfaces of the feet and insides of the hands is directly due to friction and <b>intermittent</b> <b>pressure,</b> we have the proofs:--first, that the tracts most exposed to rough usage are the most ribbed; second, that the insides of hands subject to unusual amounts of rough usage, as those of sailors, are strongly ribbed all over; and third, that in hands which are very little used, the parts commonly ribbed become quite smooth. These several kinds of evidence, however, full of meaning as they are, I give simply to prepare the way for evidence of a much more conclusive kind.|$|E
60|$|Increased use adds to {{the size}} of muscles, {{together}} with the blood-vessels, nerves, ligaments, the crests of bone and the whole bones, to which they are attached. Increased functional activity increases the size of various glands, and strengthens the sense-organs. Increased and <b>intermittent</b> <b>pressure</b> thickens the epidermis. A change {{in the nature of the}} food sometimes modifies the coats of the stomach, and augments or decreases the length of the intestines. Continued disuse, on the other hand, weakens and diminishes all parts of the organisation. Animals which during many generations have taken but little exercise, have their lungs reduced in size, and as a consequence the bony fabric of the chest and the whole form of the body become modified. With our anciently domesticated birds, the wings have been little used, and they are slightly reduced; with their decrease, the crest of the sternum, the scapulae, coracoids, and furculum, have all been reduced.|$|E

5000|$|Apart {{from the}} {{mechanism}} described above PICSO offers an unexpected regenerative potential. The mechanism is hypothesized {{to be the}} activation of vascular cells in cardiac veins in a threshold dependent way. New vasculature distal to an occluded coronary artery were described as long-term histologic changes of ischemic myocardium in presence of permanent occlusion of venous outflow in the Beck´s procedure.

Mohl describes in this hypothesis that <b>intermittent</b> <b>pressure</b> elevation results in equivalent signals normally effective during the embryonic development of the heart.

Shear stress and pulsatile stretch on venous endothelium is responsible for inducing pathways upregulating vasoactive and cardioprotective molecules.|$|E

Normal and OA cartilage was obtained at autopsy. Mononuclear cells (MNC) were isolated from synovial fluid of patients with osteoarthritis (OA-SF) or peripheral blood from healthy donors (PB). Cartilage and MNC were cultured alone and in co-culture; cultures were carried out with and without exposure to <b>intermittent</b> fluid <b>pressure.</b> Levels of <b>intermittent</b> fluid <b>pressure</b> varied from 0 to 13 kPa (0. 33 Hz), comparable with levels present during joint distraction in treatment of OA.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Experimental {{findings}} {{have suggested that}} the metabolic activities of articular cartilage can be influenced by mechanical stimuli. Our mathematical analysis predicted that cyclic compressive loading may create periods of <b>intermittent</b> sub-ambient hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> within the cartilage extracellular matrix. Based on this mathematical analysis, the present study was aimed to investigate whether the <b>intermittent</b> sub-ambient hydrostatic <b>pressure,</b> created in the cartilage extracellular matrix during cyclic compression, has a stimulative effect on the biosynthesis of chondrocytes. Method: In order to test this hypothesis, the present study developed a custom-designed sub-ambient pressure generator to subject a monolayer culture of chondrocytes to an <b>intermittent</b> sub-ambient <b>pressure.</b> Using this pressure generator, the monolayer chondrocyte culture system was analyzed for 35 S-sulfate and 3 H-proline incorporation rates for biosynthesis of proteoglycan and collagenous/noncollagenous protein molecules, respectively. Northern analyses for aggrecan and type II collagen mRNAs were also performed. Results: It was found that the <b>intermittent</b> sub-ambient <b>pressure</b> produced a 40 % increase in proteoglycan and a 17 % increase in non-collagenous protein synthesis during the pressurization period (P< 0. 05). The collagenous protein synthesis was not affected by the <b>intermittent</b> sub-ambient <b>pressure</b> regimen used in this study. After the intermittent sub-ambient pressurization, the metabolic activities of the chondrocytes returned to normal (control level). The <b>intermittent</b> sub-ambient <b>pressure</b> also produced an increase in the mRNA signals for aggrecan. Therefore, we conclude that <b>intermittent</b> sub-ambient <b>pressure</b> {{may be one of the}} potential mechanical stimulators of chondrocytes in articular cartilage during dynamic compression...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Negative {{pressure}} wound therapy (NPWT) {{is commonly}} used in the continuous mode. <b>Intermittent</b> <b>pressure</b> therapy (IPT) results in faster wound healing, but it often causes pain. Variable pressure therapy (VPT) has therefore been introduced to provide a smooth transition between 2 different pressure environments, thereby maintaining the negative pressure environment throughout the therapy. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the effects of IPT and VPT on granulation tissue formation. Method: A peripheral wound in a porcine model was treated for 72 hours with continuous NPWT (− 80 mm Hg), IPT (0 to − 80 mm Hg), or VPT (− 10 to − 80 mm Hg), using foam or gauze as wound filler. Wound contraction and force to remove the wound filler were measured. Biopsies from the wound bed were examined histologically for granulation tissue formation. Results: <b>Intermittent</b> <b>pressure</b> therapy and VPT produced similar results.

40|$|For over a century, {{there has}} been intense debate as to the reason why some cardiac {{stresses}} are pathological and others are physiological. One long-standing theory is that physiological overloads such as exercise are intermittent, while pathological overloads such as hypertension are chronic.

To test this, we applied <b>intermittent</b> <b>pressure</b> overload on the hearts of mice and tested the roles of duration and nature of the stress on the development of cardiac failure. Despite a mild hypertrophic response, preserved systolic function, and a favorable fetal gene expression profile, hearts exposed to <b>intermittent</b> <b>pressure</b> overload displayed pathological features. Importantly, <b>intermittent</b> <b>pressure</b> overload caused diastolic dysfunction, altered β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) function, and vascular rarefaction before the development of cardiac hypertrophy, which were largely normalized by preventing the recruitment of PI 3 K by βAR kinase 1 to ligand-activated receptors.

The treatment group was induced by negative pressure intermittently (pressure: 50 kPa, 30 min/times, and twice daily). The control was cultured in conventional condition. The osteogenesis of BMSCs was examined by phase-contrast microscopy, the determination of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities, and the immunohistochemistry of collagen type I.

MethodsEighteen dogs were randomly divided into 3 groups: the RCP-INT group, intermittent-retrograde cerebral perfusion at 15 mm Hg with <b>intermittent</b> <b>pressure</b> augmentation to 45 mm Hg (n = 6); the ASCP group, antegrade selective cerebral perfusion at a flow rate of 10 mL · kg− 1 · min− 1 (n = 6); and the sham group, no circulatory arrest (n = 6). Cooling (26 °C) with cardiopulmonary bypass and 60 minutes of circulatory arrest were performed in the RCP-INT and ASCP groups. The levels of tau protein in the cerebrospinal fluid and the diameters of the retinal vessels were measured.

In wound therapy, <b>intermittent</b> negative <b>pressure</b> is often preferred to continuous negative pressure as tissue exposed to intermittent therapy shows twice as much granulation tissue formation than that exposed to continuous pressure after 2 weeks of therapy. The present study was designed to elucidate the differences in microvascular blood flow in the left anterior descending artery area between continuous and intermittent myocardial topical negative pressure of - 50 mmHg. METHODS: Six pigs underwent median sternotomy. Laser Doppler probes were inserted horizontally into the heart muscle in the left anterior descending artery area at depths of approximately 5 - 6 mm. Measurements of microvascular blood flow were performed in normal myocardium and ischemic myocardium during 20 min of countinuous and <b>intermittent</b> topical negative <b>pressure</b> at - 50 mmHg.
