This report, which invokes probability-generating functions, is also an early entry in the extensive literature on statistics of branching and multiplicative processes.

2500|$|The report goes on {{to suggest}} that using a thicker ablator may improve performance, but this {{increases}} its inertia. To keep the required <b>implosion</b> <b>speed,</b> they request that the NIF energy be increased to 2MJ. One must also {{keep in mind that}} [...] can withstand only a limited amount of energy or risk permanent damage to the optical quality of the lasing medium. The reviewers question whether or not the energy of NIF is sufficient to indirectly compress a large enough capsule to avoid the mix limit and reach ignition. The report concluded that ignition within the calendar year 2012 is 'highly unlikely'.|$|E

50|$|During a weapon's crucial {{triggering}} phase, explosive {{charges that}} surround the nuclear fuel are detonated at multiple points. The result is a shock wave that moves inward (<b>implosion)</b> at supersonic <b>speeds,</b> compressing the fuel to higher and higher density. Implosion ends when the fuel reaches a supercritical density, the density at which nuclear reactions in the fuel build up an uncontainable amount of energy, which is then released in a massive explosion. To make the mockup non-nuclear, a heavy metal surrogate (such as depleted uranium or lead) stands in for the nuclear fuel, but all other components can be exact replicas. Sub-critical masses of plutonium may also be used.|$|R
