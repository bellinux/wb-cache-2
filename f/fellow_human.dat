25|$|Roman writer Ovid {{concluded}} his magnum opus Metamorphoses, in part, {{with the}} impassioned argument (uttered by {{the character of}} Pythagoras) {{that in order for}} humanity to change, or metamorphose, into a better, more harmonious species, it must strive towards more humane tendencies. He cited vegetarianism as the crucial decision in this metamorphosis, explaining his belief that human life and animal life are so entwined that to kill an animal is virtually the same as killing a <b>fellow</b> <b>human.</b>|$|E
25|$|By rationally {{seeking the}} truth, {{thinking}} freely, holding free discussions and testing teachings and authorities, freethinkers strive towards the full {{development of the}} human personality, {{with the emphasis on}} moral and rational conscience. This includes amongst other things an atheistic worldview, the choice for solidarity with <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> beings, and the realisation that life is finite and a one-off occurrence. Also, physical and emotional development is considered important for a healthy and happy life. Precisely because life is finite, it is unique and valuable, and should be experienced to the fullest. Emotionally, one needs to cope with doubt, because the critical examination of one's own dearly held beliefs, and letting go of them if they turn out to be false, is necessary to seek the truth.|$|E

500|$|The sensationalism in {{the press}} that started before the trial {{continued}} throughout the trial, the appeals process, the commutation decision, and beyond.

Roughly a thousand years prior to the main events of the series, a group of humansaided by Marcelinefled Ooo on a container ship (as seen in Stakes). They eventually settled on a secluded island chain far from the mainland. [...] Over the next thousand years, their community thrived and developed into an advanced technological society. While it was a veritable utopia, there were those few who occasionally grew dissatisfied with their rigidly structured lives and attempted to flee the island; these [...] "hiders" [...] were in turn hunted down and returned by specially trained [...] "seekers". It is revealed that Susan's real name is Kara, and that she was once a seeker in training. [...] Kara was friends with a <b>fellow</b> <b>human,</b> Frieda (voiced by Jasika Nicole), who began expressing a desire to flee the safe albeit authoritarian island. This revelation causes Kara some discomfort, so she approaches Dr. Gross (voiced by Lennon Parham), the cybernetic human in charge of training seekers, asking if the humans can live off the island. Dr. Gross convinces her that the outside is dangerous and, to prevent her from fleeing, she controls Kara with a remote control. Now fully under Dr. Gross's control, Kara stops Frieda from leaving and drags her away crying. Back in the present, Susan tells Finn her real name and decides to take Finn to Founders Island so that he can be reunited with his mother, Minerva Campbell (voiced by Sharon Horgan).|$|E
