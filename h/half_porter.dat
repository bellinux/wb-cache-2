By 1932, the brewery {{buildings and the}} warehouse building were joined as one structure, and the former machine warehouse became an independent electric plant with an ammonia tank and ice machine. A pump warehouse had been added onto {{the northwest corner of}} the former stock warehouse, and a two-story bottling plant with a basement was located {{to the north of the}} other buildings. Neuweiler produced several brands of beer: Light Lager, Cream Ale, Stock Ale, Premium Ale, Bock (seasonal), Half & <b>Half,</b> <b>Porter,</b> Stout and Hochberg. Most were available in the 12 oz.

5000|$|.....For a last objection, the Gazeteer has said, by {{a rise of}} 3/- {{per barrel}} a certain great {{brewhouse}} will be benefitted by 11,000 per annum. Perhaps is the Brewhouse I have the honour tobelong to, and perhaps it may be so much advantaged. Sir, I desire {{to be allowed to}} know somewhat of this matter, if such be the profits they make, {{it will be the first}} profits they have seen these five years. Their capital stock is not less than 120,000 and this sum in the public funds would make 6,000 per annum; remains 5,000 out of which at least one half must betaken for so much as under the circumstances of a rise on beer, it will be made of better quality; the result then is that 2 per cent would be paid by the victualler for carrying on themost laborious manufacture in England. There is then a necessity for a rise on this commodity and if it did not take place when the late additional duty on malt was imposed and when liberty was granted to the Distiller to go onin his profession, the reason was this: The London brewers willing to try what could be done in support of this charge by weakening their commodity, acted in consequence thereof and howdid the event prove? Why, their beers were small and bad to such a degree that it became a fashion with the people to drink one half twopenny and one <b>half</b> <b>porter</b> at threepence halfpenny the pot.|$|E

50|$|The second <b>half</b> of <b>Porter's</b> {{term was}} one of the {{uncommon}} times in Indiana's history where the legislature was completely controlled by a party hostile to the governor. Typical to such occasions, the assembly began to reign in the governor whose weak constitutional position made it difficult to resist. One of their first acts was to revoke all of the governor's appointment powers. He vetoed the bill on its first passage, but the assembly quickly overrode it, taking the responsibility for appointing all board members in the state, a power the governor had held since the Civil War. They also began to enact legislation designed to weaken Republican power across the state, first by creating a state board to manage the newly formed Indianapolis metropolitan police department, taking away control from the Republican-controlled city government. Along with other restrictive measures placed on the governor, they weakened the executive office to its lowest point {{in the history of the}} state. Nearly fifty years would pass before governors began to regain their former power.|$|R

By 1928 BSCP leaders decided that the only way to force the issue was to strike the company. The leadership was, however, divided on what a strike could accomplish: some rank-and-file leaders wanted to use the strike as a show of strength and an organizing tool, while Randolph was more cautious, hoping to use the threat of a strike as the lever to get the federal National Mediation Board established pursuant to the Railway Labor Act to bring the Pullman Company to the table while mobilizing support from supporters outside the industry.|$|R

The U's took the lead after 15-minutes when Ben Dickenson headed in a corner from Owen Garvan before Kurtis Guthrie added a second from the penalty spot after being fouled by former Colchester loanee Jamie Jones. Stevenage fought back with a goal late in the first half, and then equalised six minutes into the second <b>half.</b> Substitute Chris <b>Porter</b> scored his first goal since October following injury to reclaim the lead for his side, and then fellow substitute Tarique Fosu scored in injury time for a 4-2 victory.|$|R

6000|$|How {{changed the}} house is, though! The front is patched over with bills, setting forth the {{particulars}} of the furniture in staring capitals. They have hung a shred of carpet out of an upstairs window--a <b>half</b> dozen of <b>porters</b> are lounging on the dirty steps--the hall swarms with dingy guests of oriental countenance, who thrust printed cards into your hand, and offer to bid. Old women and amateurs have invaded the upper apartments, pinching the bed-curtains, poking into the feathers, shampooing the mattresses, and clapping the wardrobe drawers to and fro. Enterprising young housekeepers are measuring the looking-glasses and hangings {{to see if they}} will suit the new menage (Snob will brag for years that he has purchased this or that at Dives's sale), and Mr. Hammerdown is sitting on the great mahogany dining-tables, in the dining-room below, waving the ivory hammer, and employing all the artifices of eloquence, enthusiasm, entreaty, reason, despair; shouting to his people; satirizing Mr. Davids for his sluggishness; inspiriting Mr. Moss into action; imploring, commanding, bellowing, until down comes the hammer like fate, and we pass to the next lot.

Mingled with his ambition, to-night, were some softer fancies, rarely indulged by him in his {{forecast}} {{of the future of}} Excelsior--a dream of some fair partner in his life, after this task was accomplished, yet always of some one moving in a larger world than his youth had known. Rousing the <b>half</b> sleeping <b>porter,</b> he found, however, only the spectral gold-seeker in the vestibule,--the rays of his solitary candle falling upon her divining-rod with a quaint persistency that seemed to point to the stairs he was ascending. When he reached the first landing the rising wind through an open window put out his light, but, although the staircase was in darkness, he could see the long corridor above illuminated by the moonlight throughout its whole length. He had nearly reached it when the slow but unmistakable rustle of a dress in the distance caught his ear. He paused, not only in the interest of delicacy, but with a sudden nervous thrill he could not account for. The rustle came nearer--he could hear the distinct frou-frou of satin; and then, to his bewildered eyes, what seemed to be the figure of the dummy, arrayed in the pale blue evening dress he knew so well, passed gracefully and majestically down the corridor. He could see the shapely folds of the skirt, the symmetry of the bodice, even the harmony of the trimmings. He raised his eyes, half affrightedly, prepared to see the headless shoulders, but they--and {{what seemed to be a}} head--were concealed in a floating [...] "cloud" [...] or nubia of some fleecy tissue, as if for protection from the evening air. He remained for an instant motionless, dazed by this apparent motion of an inanimate figure; but as the absurdity of the idea struck him he hurriedly but stealthily ascended the remaining stairs, resolved to follow it. But he was only in time to see it turn into the angle of another corridor, which, when he had reached it, was empty. The figure had vanished! ...|$|R
50|$|The {{final game}} of the season was to be played on 3 May at the Community Stadium against Preston North End, who were sitting second in League One and needing to match MK Dons result against Yeovil to gain {{promotion}} to the Championship. Anything but a win against Preston would spell relegation for Colchester, while they also needed to rely on other results working in their favour to survive. With so much riding on the game, the match was selected to be shown live on Sky Sports. An end-to-end match, Colchester were put under immense pressure by Preston but defended resolutely to keep the scores at 0-0 until half-time. George Moncur was fouled in the penalty area by Preston goalkeeper Sam Johnstone ten minutes into the second <b>half,</b> and Chris <b>Porter</b> once again stepped up to take the kick. He blasted the ball over the bar, giving Preston further drive to score the goal they required to clinch promotion. However, shortly after Alex Gilbey was replaced by Sammie Szmodics and Jacob Murphy by Dion Sembie-Ferris in the 80th minute, the pair combined to win the U's a corner kick. One minute later, and Colchester had the ball {{in the back of the}} net, George Moncur the goalscorer after Chris Porter had held the ball up, placing his shot from the centre of the box past Johnstone. Colchester then held off a Preston onslaught for the remainder of normal time and the five minutes of added time. With relegation rivals Crawley, Crewe and Notts County all losing, and Leyton Orient only managing a draw, the U's stayed up by two points, finishing in 19th position and safety above Crewe who had an inferior goal difference to Colchester.|$|R
