40|$|We {{present and}} discuss {{previously}} published stratigraphic and chronological (mainly archaeological remains) {{data about the}} “Isola di Coltano Sands”(ICS), {{with the support of}} unpublished core stratigraphies and taking into account the <b>geological</b> <b>frame</b> of the Arno coastal plain. ICS outcrops in the southern portion of the extensional Viareggio Basin, forming three isolated small-sized reliefs rising up to 15 m above the present-day Arno coastal plain {{on both sides of the}} Arno River. We document that the deposits outcropping north of the Arno River (Palazzetto site) reasonably belong to the Holocene prograding beach-ridge system to which they are physically juxtaposed. Indeed, both sedimentological and morphological characteristics indicate that the Palazzetto sands were exclusively formed by wind-related processes, likely occurred during the late Holocene according to the presence of Eneolithic artefacts. Conversely, the common presence of Mousterian artefacts at the Castagnolo and Coltano sites, located south of the Arno River, documents an age older than 40 kyr (upper Pleistocene) for these reliefs. Moreover, new stratigraphic data show that ICS are constituted by alluvial deposits with evidences of repetitive fluvial erosion episodes. All these features,, indicate that ICS can be reasonably included into the Late Pleistocene Vicarello Formation, widely outcropping along the southern margin of the Leghorn Hills. In this context, an estimated age ranging between MIS 6 and MIS 3 can be hypothesized for the ICS. However, the occurrence of Upper Pleistocene reliefs formed by alluvial deposits (Coltano and Castagnolo sites) in the southern portion of the Arno coastal plain seems to conflict with the acknowledged interpretation of the area as an extensional, subsiding setting. Moreover, the sharp morphological boundary dividing the flat Holocene coastal plain from the Quaternary Leghorn Hills is roughly coincident with the SW-NE transpressive fault (Sillaro line) that subdivides the subsiding area (Viareggio Basin, to which the Arno plain belongs) from the uplifting area (Leghorn mounts). Thus, our review of the available stratigraphic and chronological data strongly suggests the occurrence of a geological connection between the southern portion of the Arno coastal plain, specifically of the Castagnolo and Coltano reliefs, and the Leghorns Hills where the Vicarello Formation outcrops. This connection, which may have strong consequences on the geotectonic interpretation of the study area, and the formation 50 age of ICS needs to be better investigated in the future with new high-resolution tectonic and absolute chronological data...|$|E
40|$|This mapping {{project is}} to fulfil part of the {{requirements}} to obtain the German diploma in geology. The final diploma work is subdivided in two parts – a thesis mapping and a thesis research project – which are often independent of each other. This mapping of the Kilauea caldera and Ka´u desert however {{is related to the}} final thesis project on brittle faulting. Hawai'i provided excellent conditions to collect data about various faulting issues. Hawai'i is almost entirely made of basalt. This very rigid material is the main material of the upper oceanic crust. It is a brittle rock of which the deformation can be studies on Hawai'i. Hawai'i is located within a tectonic plate and is therefore free of tectonic stresses. It deforms only under its own body forces. The surface is free of extensive alteration and weathering and shows a recent development of a fault- and crack system. All these advantages are paired with virtually 100 % exposed outcrops {{in the area of the}} Ka´u desert. As a student at SOEST at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1999 / 2000 I already was familiar with the Hawaiian geology. Steven Martel (GG) and Scott Rowland (HIGP) advised and supported the mapping. SOEST provided me computer, printer, software access and a large number of data sets. The data includes aerial and satellite imagery of various kinds. This enabled mapping the proximity of the fault zones in a general geological sense based on the data sets. Within the four weeks field work two tasks were done simultaneously. Fault characteristics were observed, measured and documented to be used in the thesis project and field observations were done to ground check and enhance the mapping contents. This enables putting the special faulting aspect in a large general <b>geological</b> <b>frame</b> by obtaining a general geological surface map. This report presents the results of the remote sensing based mapping. The Kilauea caldera and Ka´u desert were mapped based on the data sets LANDSAT, SPOT, AIRSAR, TIMS and a DEM. The map is done in the scale 1 : 25. 000 covering a maximum area of 255 km² (17 × 15 km) to deliver a geological surface map. In contrast to existing maps, this work handles sediment cover and surface roughness differently by defining them as individual units. Please note, that detailed faulting aspects are not covered in this report. Apart from this report and the map, a CD-ROM is included. The photographs taken during fieldwork are stored on the CD-ROM and provide additional information about the geology in the field. Please see the appendix for details in using the CD-ROM. The work period started at September 16 th 2002 by flying to Honolulu. During an approximately three week lasting period computer, printer and data access was established as well as the permission to use the software package ENVI 3. 4 to process the data at the geology department (GG) as well as at the planetary department (HIGP). Within this period the data sets were processed to a number of printouts that were used for fieldwork purposes. Details on this processing are given in chapter 3. From October 9 h to November 6 th the fieldwork was carried out in the Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park on the southernmost island Hawai'i. During this period the content and quality of the printouts/preliminary maps was checked and enhanced. The information on the remote sensing imagery was compared to the field observations to see how the image information relates to the geology. Additional data on surface units was gathered as well as numerous measurements were taken. Small-scaled features were added to the database among with a large amount of photographs. As part of the fieldwork a small amount of samples were retrieved to document the most important surface units in more detail. The remaining time on Hawai'i until the 16 th of November 2002 was spent in Honolulu to post process the datasets with ENVI. Further work on the samples and the data was carried out at the geology department of the RWTH Aachen...|$|E

The presence of this species is surprising because Bermuda is an isolated, relatively young oceanic island approximately 1000 km from the eastern United States. Here, we apply Bayesian phylogenetic analyses using a relaxed molecular clock to demonstrate that the island of Bermuda, although no older than two million years, is home to the only extant representative of one of the earliest mainland North American Plestiodon lineages, which diverged from its closest living relatives 11. 5 to 19. 8 million years ago.

Central to this objective is theconcept of habitability, the set of conditions that allows the appearance of life and successful establishment ofmicroorganisms in any one location.

We hypothesize that, given the lack of long-term, continuous habitability, if martian life developed,it was (and may still be) chemotrophic and anaerobic. Obtaining nutrition from the same kinds of sourcesas early terrestrial chemotrophic life and living in the same kinds of environments, the fossilized traces of thelatter serve as useful proxies for understanding the potential distribution of martian chemotrophs and theirfossilized traces. Thus, comparison with analog, anaerobic, volcanic terrestrial environments (Early Archean> 3. 5 – 3. 33 Ga) shows that the fossil remains of chemotrophs in such environments were common, althoughsparsely distributed, except in the vicinity of hydrothermal activity where nutrients were readily available. Moreover, the traces of these kinds of microorganisms can be well preserved, provided that they are rapidlymineralized and that the sediments in which they occur are rapidly cemented. We evaluate the biogenicity ofthese signatures by comparing them to possible abiotic features.

There are two elements of the project: 1) Biogeochemical cycles: Mangrove peats are one of the main carbon pools in the terrestrial-coastal system. Stabilisation of mangrove peats is desirable as it locks organic carbon in and reduces mineralisation which contributes to atmospheric CO 2. However, the storage and accumulation of mangrove peat carbon depends on a number factors including post burial alteration by insects and micro-organisms (bacteria and fungi). This project aims to understand the effects of termites on mangrove organic matter in mangroves. 2) Sea level change: The organic geochemistry of the peat cores tells us about past sea level rise.

40|$|Understanding {{the drivers}} {{of climate change}} {{requires}} knowledge about the global carbon (C) cycle. Although inland waters {{play an important role}} in the C cycle by emitting and burying C, streams and lakes are in general overlooked in bottom-up approached C budgets. In this thesis I estimated emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) from all lakes and streams in a 15 km 2 subarctic catchment in northern Sweden, and put it in relation to the total catchment C exchange. I show that high-latitude aquatic systems in general and streams in particular are hotspots for C emission to the atmosphere. Annually, the aquatic systems surveyed in this study emitted about 10. 8 ± 4. 9 g C m- 2 yr- 1 (ca. 98 % as CO 2) which is more than double the amount of the C laterally exported from the catchment. Although the streams only covered about 4 % of the total aquatic area they emitted ca. 95 % of the total aquatic C emission. For lake emissions, the ice break-ups were the most important annual events, counting for ca. 45 % of the emissions. Overall, streams dominated the aquatic CO 2 emission in the catchment while lakes dominated CH 4 emission, 96 % and 62 % of the totals, respectively. When summing terrestrial and aquatic C fluxes together it showed that the aquatic emissions alone account for approximately two thirds of the total annual catchment C loss. The consequence of not including inland waters in bottom-up derived C budgets is therefore a risk of overestimating the sink capacity of the subarctic landscape. However, aquatic systems can also act as C sinks, by accumulating C in sediment and thereby storing C over <b>geological</b> time <b>frames.</b> Sediment C burial rates were estimated in six lakes from a chronology based on 210 Pb dating of multiple sediment cores. The burial rate ranged between 5 - 25 g C m- 2 yr- 1, which is of the same magnitude as lake C emissions. I show that the emission:burial ratio is about ten times higher in boreal compared to in subarctic-arctic lakes. These results indicate that the balance between lakes C emission and burial is both directly and indirectly dependent on climate. This process will likely result in a future increase of C emissions from high-latitude lakes, while the C burial capacity of these same lakes sediments weaken...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} {{suggested that}} the altitudinal dependence of hydrogen isotope ratios of leaf wax n-alkanes (dDwax) {{can be used to}} estimate paleoaltitudinal changes. However, the application of dDwax-based paleoaltimetry remains difficult, as the impacts of evaporative, transpirative and biosynthetic processes on hydrogen isotope fractionations in changing environments and the influence of likely changing water vapor sources are not well explored. For this study, we sampled stream waters, soils and plant leaves along two transects spanning large gradients of altitude, precipitation amount, vapor source, temperature and vegetation type on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). dD values of stream water (as an approximation for dDp), soil water (dDsw) and plant leaf water (dDlw) as well as leaf wax n-alkanes were measured in order to quantify isotopic fractionations in the formation of leaf waxes. Most interestingly, we found a strong negative correlation between the evapotranspirative enrichment of leaf water against precipitation (elw-p), which combines the effects of soil evaporation and leaf transpiration, and the biosynthetic hydrogen isotope fractionation (ewax-lw), which describes isotopic enrichment between leaf wax and leaf water. The relationship yields a steady apparent isotopic enrichment factor (ewax-p) between leaf wax and precipitation, which is independent from climatic parameters and has an average value of 107 ± 26 ‰ for grasses (monocotyledons) and 77 ± 22 ‰ for trees (dicotyledons). Since the terrestrial n-alkanes, especially n-C 27 and n-C 29, in sediments are derived from trees and grasses, the likely change of the vegetation type in the uplift of mountains can change the isotopic estimates by about ± 30 ‰, which corresponds to an altitudinal change of 1600 m. We, therefore, suggest that hydrogen isotope ratio of sedimentary n-C 31 alkane, which is mainly derived from grasses might be better proxies to reconstruct paleoaltitudes. Our large dataset of dDwax from trees and grasses that aimed to mirror the variability of environmental factors over <b>geological</b> time <b>frames</b> showed the lapse rates were significant, but much smaller than in previous studies. Most importantly our result demonstrated that the lapse rate significantly differed for both transects (p = 0. 0068), i. e. 0. 87 ± 0. 71 ‰/ 100 m (R 2 = 0. 28, p = 0. 2841, n = 6) and 2. 28 ± 0. 82 ‰/ 100 m (R 2 = 0. 34, p = 0. 0135, n = 17) for Indian monsoon and Westerly dominated areas, respectively. This suggests that different moisture sources might strongly affected the observed lapse rates. In consequences altitude reconstructions are strongly complicated in areas with likely changing air masses like the Tibetan Plateau...|$|R

First of all, {{we do not know}} how much of the metal that is released by high-temperature venting over a given length of a ridge axis and over a specific <b>geological</b> time <b>frame</b> is actually deposited as massive sulfides or occurs as geochemical anomaly within sediments or is related to altered rocks in the upflow zone. Additionally, exploration is usually performed by identifying chemical and physical tracers in the water column limiting the search to only active deposits within or close to the neovolcanic rift zone. We also lack the ability to identify buried deposits (beneath sediments or lava) thereby underestimating the resource potential of explored areas. Systematic surveys from the ridge axis to tens of kilometers away from the axis have never been performed limiting our interpretations to a small snapshot in time. In a recent meeting at GEOMAR in Kiel, a number of researchers from various countries came together in order to discuss the necessary steps forward. We propose a regional high-resolution geological and geophysical exploration of a mid-ocean ridge segment in order to establish the metal potential of an entire slow-spreading ridge segment. Investigations will be targeted at the TAG segment (26 °N, MAR) where active and inactive massive sulfide deposits are well known and were visual observation by submersibles suggests the presence of additional massive sulfide deposits further away from the ridge axis. The metal inventory of this ridge segment, however, is still unknown despite the numerous research cruises and the presence of the 4 mio tonnes TAG deposit. As a first step we want to perform segment-scale high-resolution mapping (AUV-based bathymetry, sidescan, photomosaicing) for identifying favorable locations as well as AUV-based magnetic and subbottom profiling surveys to locate buried deposits and possibly estimate their thickness. Due to the size of the working area the simultaneous use of a fleet of AUV’s seems necessary, which requires the combined efforts of several institutes. This survey would also allow for photo surveys of large parts of the seafloor to guide in structural interpretation and provide the opportunity for large-scale habitat mapping. At later stages active and passive seismicity as well as marine EM will be employed to image the upflow zones. This information will, together with the structural interpretation, water column and petrological information as well as the regional bathymetric datasets, feed into a 3 -dimensional model of fluid flow in the crust along this ridge segment in order to constrain fluid pathways, the physicochemical conditions at depth and to ultimately budget the metal resource of this ridge segment over geological time scales. The entire project is at an early stage, however, proposals for shiptime and funding for the first surveys are being submitted this fall...|$|R
40|$|Sardinia {{represents}} a southern transect of the Variscan Belt and is classically divided from SW to NE into a fold and thrust belt Foreland, Nappe zone and Axial zone. This latter high-grade domain {{is separated from}} the Nappe zone by the so-called Posada-Asinara Line. The whole metamorphic basement is intruded by many calc-alkaline coalescent plutons forming the Corsica-Sardinia Batholith. The timing of magmatism, in Sardinia, is broadly referable to a large interval {{in the range of}} 320 - 280 Ma. Recent geological maps coupled to several chronological systematics, point out to recognize two main post-collisional magmatic peaks clustered at about 305 Ma (Older Magmatic Peak, OMP) and at 285 Ma (Young Magmatic Peak, YMP), respectively. Plutons intruding different parts of the Sardinian basement show different geological styles. Among the OMP, main differences regard: (a) the granodiorite/granite volume ratio in the main plutons; (b) the abundance of peraluminous rock-types; (c) the occurrence of mafic intrusions; (d) the abundance of late-magmatic dyke swarms. The Axial zone is dominated by monzogranites and subordinate granodiorites and leucogranites (320 - 307 Ma); tonalites and granodiorites (305 - 300 Ma), along with peraluminous granites, characterize the inner Nappe zone (i. e., Goceano, Baronie, Barbagia). Remarkably, the oldest intrusions (i. e., Barrabisa and Santa Maria: 320 Ma) are foliated and may represent a prebatholith magmatic phase. Plutons occurring in the external Nappe zone and the Foreland are generally dominated by granodiorites (e. g., Arbus, Ogliastra, Sàrrabus: 305 - 300 Ma) associated to small gabbronoritic bodies. The YMP is marked in the Axial zone by large leucogranite intrusions (Monte Lerno); gabbroic intrusions are present at 285 - 280 Ma. The YMP is dominant in the external Nappe zone and in the Foreland. This peak include monzogranites and leucogranites with minor granodiorites; specific characters are: (a) common occurrence of F-bearing, ferroan, ilmeniteseries granitoids; (b) slightly peraluminous character; (c) very shallow emplacement levels, with common greisen alteration; (d) presence of Sn-W-Mo and F ores; (e) association to swarms of tholeiitic mafic dikes. The timing and distribution of Sardinian intrusive magmatism are tentatively framed during the post-collisional evolution of the chain, in response to progressive lithospheric delamination along a N-S direction. In this model, the passive upwelling of hot astenosphere triggered dehydration melting at lower to intermediate crustal levels, associated with minor melting of the lithospheric mantle. Several major issues emerge from this schematic picture, including (a) the precise timing of the magmatic peaks, (b) the significance of the gap between them, (c) the difference in volumes and spatial distribution of the main rock-suites, (d) the <b>geological</b> and petrological <b>frame</b> at the district- to single pluton-, up to regional scale, and (e) the age of mafic dyke swarms...|$|R
