50|$|In an <b>individual</b> <b>guarantee,</b> {{such as that}} guaranteeing the {{neutrality}} of Belgium, powers which {{signed the}} treaty would be bound to individually defend a nation's neutrality regardless {{of the actions of}} the other signatories. In a collective guarantee, such as this treaty with Luxemburg, the major signatories would act in concert or would not be required to act at all. The distinction between individual and collective guarantee resulted in some confusion when the Germans invaded both Belgium and Luxemburg in August 1914. Since Germany inherited Prussia's 1867 commitment to a collective guarantee, by invading Luxemburg it rendered impossible any joint action in defense of Luxemburg's neutrality. Britain was therefore not required to intervene to defend Luxemburg. However, since Belgium was individually guaranteed by the major powers (including Britain), the British government felt obliged to defend its neutrality against German invasion.|$|E

50|$|The {{squeeze on}} the middle class is also causing {{difficulties}} when it comes to saving money for retirement because of decreased real incomes and increases in consumer prices. In 2007, 1 in 3 American workers said they hadn't saved at all for their retirement and of those who have started saving, more than half claim to have saved less than $25,000. There has also been a shift in employer retirement plans, with a shift from traditional defined benefit pension plans to 401k plans, {{in which there is no}} <b>individual</b> <b>guarantee</b> about the amount of retirement income that will be available. The percentage of workers covered by a traditional defined benefit (DB) pension plan declined steadily from 38% in 1980 to 20% in 2008. Employees in unions are more likely to be covered by a defined benefit plan, with 67% of union workers covered by such a plan during 2011 versus 13% of non-union workers.|$|E

For this purpose we utilize the collective choice function to represent resource allocation strategies. We utilize an axiomatic framework to emulate certain desirable and undesirable properties of resource allocation strategies. We utilize basic bargaining sets {{as a tool}} to investigate the individual guarantees of certain commonly encountered resource allocation strategies - max-min balancing, maximization of the sum of utilities and proportional fairness. We also provide certain interesting consequences to continuity related properties of resource allocation strategies. The basic bargaining sets along with the <b>individual</b> <b>guarantee</b> structures provide certain intuition as to what could be means for implementing a fairer pricing strategy based on the losses incurred by users currently in the system, when new users arrive in the system...|$|E
40|$|Service level {{agreements}} (SLAs) {{are typically}} used to specify rules regarding {{the consumption of}} services that are agreed between the providers of the service-based applications (SBAs) and their consumers. An SLA includes a list of terms that contain the guarantees that must be fulfilled during the provisioning and consumption of the services. Since the violation of such guarantees {{may lead to the}} application of potential penalties, it is important to assure that the SBA behaves as expected. In this paper, we propose a proactive approach to test SLA-aware SBAs by means of identifying test requirements, which represent situations that are relevant to be tested. To address this issue, we define a four-valued logic that allows evaluating both the <b>individual</b> <b>guarantee</b> terms and their logical relationships. Grounded in this logic, we devise a test criterion based on the modified condition decision coverage (MCDC) in order to obtain a cost-effective set of test requirements from the structure of the SLA. Furthermore by analyzing the syntax and semantics of the agreement, we define specific rules to avoid non-feasible test requirements. The whole approach has been automated and applied over an eHealth case study...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn Mexico, {{from the}} eighties decade, various {{documents}} were made, {{and in which}} is specified the health care of the population, including obesity, documents which have been enriched by documents recently issued yet. However, as a health problem, overweight and obesity have become major challenges, placing the country at first place in health statistics on worldwide. This situation is identified in the different zones of the country, {{such as in the}} case of the State of Mexico. The objective of this work was to understand the relationship between emission of health programs, its contents, and the performance of the participants. The present paper was documentary, retrospective, analytical, and reflective kind. In a first step, different documents issued at national and regional level, characterized by including the regulatory framework for the care of obesity, were analyzed. Subsequently, the findings of four researches were considered, which made a link between the programs and their implementation. It can be stated that in Mexico, the health care and prevention of obesity are classified as an <b>individual</b> <b>guarantee,</b> expressed in the Political Constitution. As part of the national health policies, various documents establish the prevention of obesity; however by contrasting them with the results of the four studies, an inconsistency in implementation is identified. A closely monitoring of the process of implementation of preventive programs is required, to achieve the objectives posed in national health policies...|$|E

40|$|In {{the scope}} of Service Based Applications (SBAs), a Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a {{contract}} or document that contains the conditions that must be fulfilled during the provision and consumption of the services. The research hypothesis states that a cost-effective set of test cases can be systematically obtained by means of analyzing {{the information contained in}} the SLA, which is specified using the WS-Agreement standard language. The execution of such test cases would contribute to prevent, minimize or mitigate the negative consequences derived from the violations of the SLA. In this PhD the testing of SLA-aware Service Based Applications has been addressed by means of devising SLATF (SLA Testing Framework). SLATF allows identifying a set of test requirements from the information contained in the SLA and, later, deriving the test suites to exercise such requirements. SLATF also proposed a four-valued logic in order to unequivocally evaluate the SLA and its guarantee terms. The identification of test requirements and derivation of test cases in SLATF are performed within two different approaches. On the one hand, the <b>individual</b> <b>guarantee</b> terms of the SLA are considered in order to design the tests. In this case, combinatorial testing techniques are used to combine the test requirements and obtain a reduced number of test cases. On the other hand, the logical relationships between the guarantee terms are also taken into account. In this second case, a coverage based criterion is devised in order to derive the test cases. Both testing approaches presented in this dissertation have been automated in the SLACT (SLA Combinatorial Testing) tool and evaluated in an eHealth service-based scenario...|$|E
40|$|From a contextual {{and service}} users’ perspective, this thesis investigates the poverty {{reducing}} effect of microfinance including the implementation processes and features of microfinance. Poverty {{is in this}} study conceptualised as ‘capability deprivation’ so that poverty reduction is achieved through improved capabilities for the poor. The literature review on microfinance begins with an attempt to locate the reasons for microfinance {{within the context of}} the finance-development and credit rationing literature. It also recognises the institutional-based approach to understanding the exclusion of the poor; and recognizes the role of lending group and social relations within the group in shaping individual and social capabilities of the poor. Next, it reviews some of the recent discourses in the microfinance literature. It uncovers a call in the literature for studies that look beyond impact to evaluate the features and characteristics of microfinance delivery and use from the clients’ perspective. The central arguments of this thesis include: (i) the utility or disutility of microfinance stems from the features of microfinance and its implementation strategies, as well as clients’ practices. (ii) The microfinance literature has not paid enough attention to the perspectives of service users, which can adversely affect microfinance assessments and its potential for poverty reduction. The study examines LAPO microfinance intervention in semi-urban and urban areas in Edo State, Nigeria. Given the research objective, design and methods, data collection and analysis were guided by the Interpretive, Capability and Poverty Participatory Assessment approaches. The mixed methods approach is selected as the most appropriate for addressing the research questions. Secondary data as well as primary data sourced from 35 interviews and 62 questionnaires were employed. Data analysis was conducted using qualitative, frequency distributions, cross-tabulations, Logit and OLS regression analysis. This study finds that service user perceptions of poverty place value on a stable source of livelihood, and the ability to meet basic material household needs. Hence, poverty reduction is measured as increased household capabilities as well as the increased ability to achieve successful business outcomes. The findings show that service users’ perceptions affirm the poverty reducing effect of microfinance. It also confirms the proposition that the various implementation processes and features of microfinance have unique effects on service users with differing potential for good or harm. The use of trust and personal relations as criteria for selecting group members, as well as the use of an <b>individual</b> <b>guarantee</b> to insure against risk due to imperfect information, suggests the possibility of exclusion. Heterogeneity in groups as well as low monitoring levels leave service users exposed to greater risk of moral hazard. Peer support enables service users to share ideas and build social networks vital to the success of their businesses and for raising social capital important for combating poverty. Despite the potency of the threat of social sanctions in enforcing repayment, the actual implementation of social sanctions and peer pressure comes at a cost to service users, including damaging social relations. While the targeting of women fosters their empowerment, the labelling of microfinance as a pro-women initiative has the potential to reinforce rather than challenge the prevailing gender bias in the Nigerian society. As regards loans, high repayment burden arising from the use of dynamic incentive creates the potential for harm. The use of savings as loan guarantee against peer defaults also has a similar effect. Although service users affirm the role of savings and non-financial services in the expansion of capabilities, the obscurity surrounding the access to some of the more criteria-determined non-financial services, is found to be damaging to service users’ experience. Hence, this study argues that while there are some links between poverty reduction and microfinance, these two are complexly related...|$|E

40|$|In the USA, {{previous}} to {{the implementation}} of the Affordable Care Act, about 50 million people under 65 years didn 4 t have any (private or public) health insurance. A lot of them have been temporally insured via an employer sponsored group insurance. Because of the linkage to the job, group insurance does only provide an incomplete protection against long term health costs. Alternatively, an <b>individual</b> <b>guaranteed</b> renewable contract allows for long term protection. This paper considers the possible options of a young, still good risk person. A person who is a high risk today could have been a healthy and low-risk person in the past. This article analyses essential factors explaining the attractiveness of group insurance compared to an individual long term contract. If the group insurance goes along with the abandonment of long term contracts, it can contribute to a high level of temporarily non-insured persons. As the price gap between employer-sponsored group insurance and <b>individual</b> <b>guaranteed</b> renewable contracts is partly state-induced, non-insurance can also be the result of a state-induced crowding-out of long term protection...|$|R
