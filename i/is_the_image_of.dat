25|$|In mathematics, {{representation}} {{is a very}} general relationship that expresses similarities between objects. Roughly speaking, a collection Y of mathematical objects {{may be said to}} represent another collection X of objects, provided that the properties and relationships existing among the representing objects yi conform in some consistent way to those existing among the corresponding represented objects xi. Somewhat more formally, for a set Π of properties and relations, a Π-representation of some structure X is a structure Y that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> X under a homomorphism that preserves Π. The label {{representation is}} sometimes also applied to the homomorphism itself.|$|E
25|$|Algebro-geometrically, McKay also {{associates}} E6, E7, E8 respectively with: the 27 {{lines on}} a cubic surface, the 28 bitangents {{of a plane}} quartic curve, and the 120 tritangent planes of a canonic sextic curve of genus 4. The first of these is well-known, while the second is connected as follows: projecting the cubic from any point not on a line yields a double cover of the plane, branched along a quartic curve, with the 27 lines mapping to 27 of the 28 bitangents, and the 28th line <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the exceptional curve of the blowup. Note that the fundamental representations of E6, E7, E8 have dimensions 27, 56 (28·2), and 248 (120+128), {{while the number of}} roots is 27+45 = 72, 56+70 = 126, and 112+128 = 240.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the statues}} present {{exceptional}} details. For example, one madanakai figure is shown with a fruit tree canopy, {{where a small}} fly is shown sitting on the fruit and nearby a lizard is preparing to pounce on the fly. In another, an eagle is shown attacking a sarabha, {{which in turn is}} attacking a lion, which in turn is pouncing on an elephant, which itself is seizing a snake, which in turn is shown in the act of swallowing a rat – a sight that includes a pondering sage. Secular life is shown in these images, such as an artist making a drawing or musicians lost in their music. A notable image is the depiction of 12th century Rudra-vina and a Lasya dance posture. Also included <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> a Jina of Jainism.|$|E

25|$|The Altar das Almas (Altar of Souls) {{was erected}} in 1640 by the Irmandade das Almas (Brotherhood of Souls), under the {{direction}} of canon Leonardo de Sotto Mayor (died in 1653). This altar has an allusive tile depicting the salvation of souls, and representing the Holy Trinity, Virgin Mary and Saint Dominic. At the Altar da Nossa Senhora dos Anjos (Altar of Our Lady of Angels) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> Nossa Senhora da Conceição (Our Lady of the Conception) dated to the 17th century, which was transplanted from the old Convent of São Francisco da Praia.

25|$|The main {{church of}} the city is the Basilica Colegiata de Nuestra Señora de Guanajuato built between 1671 and 1696. Overall, the church is a sober Mexican Baroque in style but there are popular {{elements}} from donations made by the area’s miners, and other elements that demonstrate the influence several of the city’s rich mining nobility. The Marquis of San Clemente and Pedro Lascuraìn de Retana were the current building’s first patrons. Later, the Counts of Valenciana left their influence as well with the donation of a clock for one of the towers and the acquisition of relics related to a saint and martyr named Faustina obtained from the Pope. These relics are in the main altar. The main portal is made of pink sandstone with “estipite” or inverted truncated pyramidal columns. The focus of the main altar <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> Our Lady of Guanajuato (Nuestra Señora de Guanjuato), who is the patroness of the city. She was donated to the city by Carlos I and his son Felipe II in 1557. In 1696, the church gained minor basilica status and full basilica status in 1957.|$|E
