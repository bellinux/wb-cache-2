5|$|According to {{quantum chromodynamics}} (QCD), quarks possess a {{property}} called color charge. There are {{three types of}} color charge, arbitrarily labeled blue, green, and red. Each of them is complemented by an anticolor – antiblue, antigreen, and antired. <b>Every</b> quark carries a color, while <b>every</b> antiquark carries an anticolor.|$|E
5|$|As planned, {{counterclockwise}} trains, to {{and from}} Jamaica and Howard Beach, would have run <b>every</b> 2 minutes during peak hours, for a frequency of 30 trains per hour (tph). Each branch would have been served by a train <b>every</b> four minutes, or 15 tph. The final environmental impact statement planned for even higher frequencies of 40 tph, or a train <b>every</b> 90 seconds in the central terminal area. However, , actual frequencies were much lower, with each branch being served by one train <b>every</b> 7 to 12 minutes during peak hours, or 5 to 8.5 tph. During middays, trains come <b>every</b> 10 to 15 minutes, with 4 to 6 tph on each branch. Late night service is less frequent: trains come <b>every</b> 15 to 20 minutes, with 3 to 4 tph on each branch. Weekend service is similar to night service, with trains coming <b>every</b> 16 minutes, or 4 tph on each branch. Trains make the journey between the terminals and either Jamaica or Howard Beach in about eight minutes.|$|E

5|$|<b>Every</b> 3-colorable graph G that {{contains}} a triangle (that is, has the complete graph K3 as a subgraph) is homomorphically equivalent to K3. This is because, on one hand, a 3-coloring of G {{is the same as}} a homomorphism G → K3, as explained below. On the other hand, <b>every</b> subgraph of G trivially admits a homomorphism into G, implying K3 → G. This also means that K3 is the core of any such graph G. Similarly, <b>every</b> bipartite graph that has at least one edge is equivalent to K2.|$|E

5|$|Expanding {{access to}} parks was {{a feature of}} many {{initiatives}} Jewell undertook as Secretary. A 2014 Secretarial Order set benchmarks to increase youth involvement, seeking to create opportunities {{for young people to}} play, learn, serve, and work in national parks. Jewell led the kickoff of the <b>Every</b> Kid <b>Every</b> Park program by leading fourth graders on a hike through Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. The <b>Every</b> Kid initiative made <b>every</b> fourth grade student, and their families, eligible for a free one-year pass to <b>every</b> national park. Jewell also backed a 2016 initiative to expedite permitting for youth organizations to explore public wild lands on overnight or multi-day trips, particularly in less popular parks.|$|E

Following this, tamp the surface with pestles or stamp with feet randomly to even out the surface. <b>Every</b> five-cun layer of earth should be compressed to three cun; <b>every</b> three-cun layer of brick and stone to one and a half cun.|$|E

5|$|Moving from {{individual}} graphs to graph families, if {{a family of}} graphs has the property that <b>every</b> subgraph of a graph in the family {{is also in the}} family, and <b>every</b> graph in the family has at most as many edges as vertices, then the family contains only pseudoforests. For instance, <b>every</b> subgraph of a thrackle (a graph drawn so that <b>every</b> pair of edges has one point of intersection) is also a thrackle, so Conway's conjecture that <b>every</b> thrackle has at most as many edges as vertices can be restated as saying that <b>every</b> thrackle is a pseudoforest. A more precise characterization is that, if the conjecture is true, then the thrackles are exactly the pseudoforests with no four-vertex cycle and at most one odd cycle.|$|E
