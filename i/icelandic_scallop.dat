40|$|Sea {{temperature}} {{is one of}} the primary factor limiting the overall geographical range of most marine species, including the <b>Icelandic</b> <b>scallop.</b> In Iceland, the sub-arctic <b>Icelandic</b> <b>scallop</b> resides at its southern limits. As a result, {{it is likely to be}} especially vulnerable to changes in the immediate environment. During the last 5 years, the stock size of Iceland scallop in Breidifjordur on the West coast of Iceland has undergone a dramatic decline. This period has been characterized by steady increase in summer sea temperature and in 2003 the temperature had reached a historical maximum of the last century. As well, since 1998, there have been fluctuations in chl-a level, with the lowest values observed in 1999 and 2000. At the same time, muscle weight has declined and a minimum weight was attained in 2001 - 2002. In the following years, natural mortality of scallops in Breidifjordur increased significantly. The mortality was however quite localized within the main fishing area in the southern part of Breidifjordur. At the same time two Coccidia parasites have been described in Iceland scallop from Breidifjordur. These parasite may have influenced the survival of the scallops. Recruitment into the fishable stock in Breidifjordur was highly variable during the 1993 - 2003, with low recruitment towards the end of the 1990 ’s. Due to high total fishing mortality during the 1990 - 2000, the fishery depended on relatively few year classes. Therefore the fragile status of the stock did not endure the medium-high exploitation rates in conjunction with several years of poor recruitment...|$|E
40|$|New {{information}} is presented on the distribution, size composition, sex ratio, maturity {{and growth of}} the <b>Icelandic</b> <b>scallop</b> (Chlamys islandica) along West Greenland. In West Greenland, populations of C. islandica are mainly distributed in the outer regions of fjords at depths between 20 – 60 m. They are distributed in areas characterized by strong tidal currents and populations are generally composed of large scallops {{in the range of}} 60 – 110 mm shell height with the majority being 75 – 100 mm. There is minor morphometric variation between areas. The sex ratio is generally 1 : 1 and they become sexually mature from 30 to 55 mm shell height at ages 4 – 9 years. There are small differences in shell height-at-age between males and females, but between area means vary from 58 to 68 mm at age 10 years. Seasonal and areal variations in both the muscle and gonad weights were also ob-served...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{decrease}} of ice cover in polar areas {{is expected to}} {{lead to an increase}} in ship traffic. In this context, the risk associated with exposure of the aquatic environment to oil-related chemicals from spills and/or accidental fuel discharges from ships will increase in the near future, potentially causing negative impacts on sensitive Arctic species. This study investigated {{for the first time the}} biomarker responses of the <b>Icelandic</b> <b>scallops</b> (Chlamys islandica) to marine diesel exposure. Antioxidant response, neurotoxic effect, gonad maturation, and lipid content were assessed in male and female scallops, Chlamys islandica after a 7 -day exposure to marine diesel. At the end of exposure, results showed an inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity in <b>Icelandic</b> <b>scallops</b> exposed to high concentration of diesel. At the end of exposure, results showed an increase in naphthalene residues in hemolymph, together with an inhibition of AChE activity in <b>Icelandic</b> <b>scallops</b> exposed to high concentration of diesel. In addition, alteration of the escape capacity was observed suggesting effects on behavior responses. Overall, this study contributes to the better knowledge of physiological effects of marine diesel in Arctic marine organisms...|$|R
