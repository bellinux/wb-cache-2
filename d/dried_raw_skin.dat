40|$|Abstract Background The two-step dilute acid {{hydrolysis}} (DAH) of softwood is costly in energy demands and capital costs. However, {{it has the}} advantage that hydrolysis and subsequent removal of hemicellulose-derived sugars {{can be carried out}} under conditions of low severity, resulting in a reduction in the level of sugar degradation products during the more severe subsequent steps of cellulose hydrolysis. In this paper, we discuss a single-step DAH method that incorporates a temperature profile at two levels. This profile should simulate the two-step process while removing its major disadvantage, that is, the washing step between the runs, which leads to increased energy demand. Results The experiments were conducted in a reactor with a controlled temperature profile. The total dry matter content of the hydrolysate was up to 21. 1 % w/w, corresponding to a content of 15. 5 % w/w of water insoluble solids. The highest measured glucose yield, (18. 3 g glucose per 100 g <b>dry</b> <b>raw</b> material), was obtained after DAH cycles of 3 min at 209 °C and 6 min at 211 °C with 1 % H 2 SO 4, which resulted in a total of 26. 3 g solubilized C 6 sugars per 100 g <b>dry</b> <b>raw</b> material. To estimate the remaining sugar potential, enzymatic hydrolysis (EH) of the solid fraction was also performed. EH of the solid residue increased the total level of solubilized C 6 sugars to a maximum of 35. 5 g per 100 g <b>dry</b> <b>raw</b> material when DAH was performed as described above (3 min at 210 °C and 2 min at 211 °C with 1 % H 2 SO 4). Conclusion The dual-temperature DAH method did not yield decisively better results than the single-temperature, one-step DAH. When we compared the results with those of earlier studies, the hydrolysis performance was better than with the one-step DAH but not {{as well as that of}} the two-step, single-temperature DAH. Additional enzymatic hydrolysis resulted in lower levels of solubilized sugars compared with other studies on one-step DAH and two-step DAH followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. A two-step steam pretreatment with EH gave rise to a considerably higher sugar yield in this study. </p...|$|R
