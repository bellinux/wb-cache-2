40|$|The {{connection}} of the mining-geological and mining-technical factors with <b>dirt</b> <b>retention</b> {{of the shaft}} waters has been determined. The ability of the cultural suspension of the sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) to the iron floculation in the acid shaft water has been revealed, the regularity of influencing different factors of the SRB metabolism on the iron deposition process in the shaft water has been revealed. The prescription execution of the industrial nutrient medium for SRB cultivation has been developed and patented. The electrolysis apparatus for correction of pH in the shaft water has been created and patented. The cleaning biotechnology of the acid shaft waters bases on the biofloculation of the heavy metals by the cultural suspension of SRB with following correction of pH has been created and patented. The fall-out processing technology has been developed. The basic results of the work have been introduced by the Institute "Uralgiproshacht" at design of the station on the cleaning of the acid shaft waters.

40|$|Antireflection (AR) {{coatings}} can {{be incorporated}} into highly transmitting glazings that, depending on their cost, performance, and durability of optical properties, can be economically viable in solar collectors, agricultural greenhouses, and PV systems. A number of AR-coated glazings have been prepared {{under the auspices of the}} International Energy Agency (IEA) Working Group on Durability of Materials for Solar Thermal Collectors. The AR coatings are of two types, including (1) various sol-gels applied to glass and (2) an embossed treatment of sheet acrylic. Typically, for unweathered glazings, a 4 % [...] 5 % increase in solar-weighted transmittance has been achieved. For AR-coated glass, reflectance values as low as 0. 5 % [...] 0. 7 % at selected wavelengths (680 [...] 720 nm) were obtained. To determine the durability of the hemispherical transmittance, several collaborating countries are testing these materials both outdoors and in accelerated weathering chambers. All materials exposed outdoors are affixed to mini-collector boxes to simulate flat-plate collector conditions. Results for candidate AR coatings weathered at geographically disperse outdoor test sites exhibit changes in spectral transmittance primarily in the high visible range (600 [...] 700 nm). Accelerated testing at measured levels of simulated solar irradiance and at different constant levels of temperature and relative humidity have been performed in different countries. Parallel testing with different levels of laboratory-controlled relevant stress factors permits the time-dependent performance of these materials to be compared with measured results from in-service outdoor exposure conditions. Coating adhesion and performance loss resulting from <b>dirt</b> and dust <b>retention</b> are also discussed...|$|R
