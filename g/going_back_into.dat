5|$|Anselm stuck {{firmly to}} {{the letter of the}} papal decree, despite Henry's {{attempts}} to persuade him to give way in return for a vague assurance of a future royal compromise. Matters escalated, with Anselm <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> exile and Henry confiscating the revenues of his estates. Anselm threatened excommunication, and in July 1105 the two men finally negotiated a solution. A distinction was drawn between the secular and ecclesiastical powers of the prelates, under which Henry gave up his right to invest his clergy, but retained the custom of requiring them to come and do homage for the temporalities, the landed properties they held in England. Despite this argument, the pair worked closely together, combining to deal with Duke Robert's invasion of 1101, for example, and holding major reforming councils in 1102 and 1108.|$|E

25|$|Various {{types of}} {{quantitative}} and semi-quantitative information {{are available to}} constrain past plate motions. The geometric fit between continents, such as between west Africa and South America is still {{an important part of}} plate reconstruction. Magnetic stripe patterns provide a reliable guide to relative plate motions <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the Jurassic period. The tracks of hotspots give absolute reconstructions, but these are only available back to the Cretaceous. Older reconstructions rely mainly on paleomagnetic pole data, although these only constrain the latitude and rotation, but not the longitude. Combining poles of different ages in a particular plate to produce apparent polar wander paths provides a method for comparing the motions of different plates through time. Additional evidence comes from the distribution of certain sedimentary rock types, faunal provinces shown by particular fossil groups, and the position of orogenic belts.|$|E

25|$|Humans often form ethnic groups, {{such groups}} {{tend to be}} larger than kinship {{networks}} and be organized around a common identity defined variously in terms of shared ancestry and history, shared cultural norms and language, or shared biological phenotype. Such ideologies of shared characteristics are often perpetuated {{in the form of}} powerful, compelling narratives that give legitimacy and continuity to the set of shared values. Ethnic groupings often correspond to some level of political organization such as the band, tribe, city state or nation. Although ethnic groups appear and disappear through history, members of ethnic groups often conceptualize their groups as having histories <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the deep past. Such ideologies give ethnicity a powerful role in defining social identity and in constructing solidarity between members of an ethno-political unit. This unifying property of ethnicity has been closely tied to the rise of the nation state as the predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th century.|$|E

The album has been furthered delayed because of Milian's marriage to The-Dream and her pregnancy. In January 2010, Milian said that she was <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the studio in the summer to record more material. Although the album had already been finished when Milian took a break for her pregnancy, she wanted to [...] "go back and re-do some of the music and make some new songs and find my new inspiration".

50|$|Tetralogy of Fallot is {{the most}} common {{congenital}} heart disease arising in 1-3 cases per 1,000 births.

50|$|Historians {{disagree}} {{on whether the}} emperor Diocletian, {{or one of his}} successors, such as Constantine I, split the Roman military into frontier armies and field armies.

Bishop and J.C.M. Coulston attribute mainly an expansion to Diocletian, and the reorganization to Constantine I and his successors. Karl Strobel sees the reorganization as the culmination of trends <b>going</b> <b>back</b> well <b>into</b> the 3rd century, with Diocletian strengthening both the frontier and field armies.|$|R
2500|$|Physiologically, in {{individuals}} with a normally functioning aortic valve, the valve is only open when the pressure in the left ventricle {{is higher than the}} pressure in the aorta. This allows the blood to be ejected from the left ventricle into the aorta during ventricular systole. The amount of blood that is ejected by the heart is known as the stroke volume. Under normal conditions, [...] >50% of the blood in a filled left ventricle is ejected into the aorta to be used by the body. After ventricular systole, the pressure in the left ventricle decreases as it relaxes and begins to fill up with blood from the left atrium. [...] This relaxation of the left ventricle (early ventricular diastole) causes a fall in its pressure. When the pressure in the left ventricle falls below the pressure in the aorta, the aortic valve will close, preventing blood in the aorta from <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the left ventricle.|$|E
