25|$|Synchronized film {{dialogue}} became {{possible in}} the late 1920s, with the perfection of the audion amplifier tube {{and the introduction of}} the Vitaphone system. Thus, the era of the silent movie came to an end. Viguié incorporated the new sound technology into his documentaries, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews</b> he conducted with political and entertainment celebrities.|$|E
25|$|Sir Alan Sugar later {{admitted}} in the post-series You're Hired special, that Miriam didn't {{deserve to be}} fired at this point, and heavily implied that he felt he should have fired Paul in retrospect. However, Sir Alan added that unless Miriam had put in an exceptionally good performance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews,</b> Tim and Saira would still have been the final two.|$|E

25|$|Palin was {{reported}} to have prepared intensively for the October 2 vice-presidential debate with Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee Joe Biden at Washington University in St. Louis. Some Republicans suggested that Palin's performance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews</b> would improve public perceptions of her debate performance by lowering expectations. Polling from CNN, Fox and CBS found that while Palin exceeded most voters' expectations, they felt that Biden had won the debate.|$|E
25|$|Claude Littner (Series 11-present) - Primarily {{assigned}} as {{an interviewer}} {{on the show}} since its conception, he was appointed by Alan Sugar as Nick Hewer's replacement following his departure from the role of adviser, with this appointment being confirmed prior to the eleventh series beginning its broadcast. Although he operates in this role throughout the competition, he retains his position as an interviewer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interviews</b> Stage, while he appears as a guest panellist on You're Fired having done so since 2012, four years before becoming an adviser to Lord Sugar.|$|E
25|$|Bonin {{was cleared}} of the sodomy {{and murder of}} Sean King because he had led police {{to the body of}} the victim in December 1980, with the {{agreement}} that his leading police to King's body could not be used against him in court, and therefore the prosecutors had discussed King's disappearance at the trial, but not the discovery of his body; he was cleared of the charges of mayhem and murder against Lundgren because, according to David López, he had strenuously denied committing this particular killing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews</b> he had granted to him.|$|E

5|$|The {{trial judge}} also {{concluded}} that Thomas had been properly informed {{of his right}} to silence, and had not been induced by the AFP officers to participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> by offer of repatriation or any other reward. Ultimately he decided that Thomas had participated voluntarily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview,</b> and that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circumstances, Thomas' lack of legal advice should not make the record of <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> inadmissible.|$|R
25|$|Helene came {{perilously close}} to being fired due to her failure to make any sales, along with suspicions by Sir Alan and his {{advisers}} (particularly Margaret) that she had consciously {{decided to take a}} backseat due to her having the least sales experience of the three members of Renaissance, but was saved by the fact that Sir Alan felt she {{had been one of the}} strongest candidates prior to her three-week losing run, and decided to give her a chance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews.</b> The You're Fired panel, while agreeing with Michael's dismissal, felt that firing Helene would have also been justifiable.|$|E
25|$|Candidate Reviews: Despite {{her having}} the weakest {{track record of}} the final four and her unwillingness to admit ever being wrong about anything, the interviewers {{unanimously}} considered Saira {{to be the most}} impressive of the candidates, giving her much praise for her prior accomplishments and salesmanship, and even feeling that her abrasiveness could be a strength in the right circumstances. The interviewers noted that while James was, on paper, the strongest of the four candidates, they found him unconvincing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews</b> and questioned whether his heart was in the process. Meanwhile, Tim was commended for his passion, determination and business knowledge, but the interviewers considered him to be naive and were concerned that stepping up to run one of Sir Alan's businesses would be a step too far, while Paul was deemed the weakest of the candidates, mostly due to his short temper and background in businesses that had very little relation to anything Sir Alan did.|$|E
25|$|Result: The interviewers {{felt that}} Stephen Higgins {{was the most}} {{impressive}} candidate out of the remaining 3 in terms of entrepreneurship. However, his CV was filled with exaggerations, and he wasn't {{shown to be a}} trustworthy teammate due to his arrogance and his self-preserved agendas. Although he appeared as a tough guy, he didn't come across with a lot of self-esteem. Geraldine was thought to be the most likeable candidate who appeared with the most determination and a good capacity to learn and develop. The problems the interviewers found with Geraldine included her distracting profile in her CV which included spelling errors, and that she didn't seem capable enough to deliver results at the level Bill wanted due to her inexperience. Steve Rayner was described as a world-class salesman. Although he has exceptionally good skills selling face to face, it was argued about whether he could rise to a much more senior position in the field of sales. Steve couldn't prove this in his CV or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews</b> (particularly to David), but it was said that he did come across with the potential to do so. It was also said that hiring Steve would be a risk, because it was revealed that he had problems with alcohol and gambling addictions in his background.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{and compares}} {{the use and}} function of the formulation [...] decision pair in three types of diagnostic <b>interviewing.</b> <b>The</b> investigatory type of interviewing, which typically occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medical <b>interview,</b> {{is characterized by the}} absence of formulations. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> exploratory type of interviewing, which typically occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> psychiatric <b>interview,</b> <b>the</b> interviewer uses the formulation-decision pair for exploring the patient's experiences. He does not, however, formulate his professional assessment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> collaborative type, which typically is found <b>in</b> psychotherapy, <b>the</b> formulation-decision pair is the main interactional device used by the interviewer for translating the patient's troubles into a professional problem definition. It is suggested that the patient's protoprofessionalization, which is typical for psychotherapy, already begins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>interview</b> and that it is an effect of the interviewer's specific use of <b>the</b> formulation-decision device <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview...</b>|$|R
25|$|In a November {{afternoon}} of 1999, Cárdenas {{learned that a}} Gulf Cartel informant was being transported through Matamoros, Tamaulipas, by the FBI and DEA. According to the story mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews</b> 11 years after this life-or-death incident, the DEA agent Joe DuBois and FBI agent Daniel Fuentes were riding in a white Ford Bronco with diplomatic plates along the streets of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. For years, both were working for the disarticulation of the cartels in Mexico, and both knew how the drug cartels worked south of the border. In {{the back seat of}} the car, a Mexican informant from a local newspaper on crime coverage guided the two agents and gave them a tour on the city's drug routes and on the homes of the drug lords of the city. They even cruised by Cárdenas' house, a pink-colored mansion with tall walls, security cameras, armed guards and roof-snipers. Within moments, according to DuBois, a Lincoln Continental was on their tail, then a stolen pickup truck with Texan plates. The federal agents were cut off and surrounded by at least five vehicles, including one by a former state police officer. Just yards away from Matamoros' police department, the agents were surrounded by a convoy of gunmen from the Gulf Cartel, which included Costilla Sánchez. Some wore police and military uniforms. Nearby, other men, also in police uniform, directed traffic.|$|E

500|$|Her Story is an {{interactive}} movie game, {{focusing on a}} series of seven fictional police interviews from 1994. As the game begins, players are presented with an old desktop, which contains several files and programs. Among the programs are instructional text files, which explain the game's mechanics. One of the programs automatically open on the desktop is the [...] "L.O.G.I.C. Database", which allows players to search and sort video clips within the database, of which there are 271. The video clips are police interviews with Hannah Smith, a British woman. The interviews are unable to be watched in their entirety, forcing players to view short clips. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews,</b> Hannah answers unknown questions to an off-screen detective, prompting players to decipher the context of the answers. Hannah's answers are transcribed, and players find clips by searching in the database for words from the transcriptions, attempting to solve the case by piecing together information. As players select clips, they can enter user tags, which are then available as searchable terms. One of the files on the desktop is a database checker, which allows players to review the amount of clips that have been viewed; as a clip is viewed, the red box in the database checker changes to green. The desktop also features the minigame Mirror Game, based on the strategy board game Reversi.|$|E
50|$|Interview phase:The <b>interview</b> phase entails <b>the</b> actual {{conduct of}} <b>the</b> <b>interview,</b> <b>the</b> {{interaction}} between the interviewer and the applicant. Initial interviewer impressions about the applicant before <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> may influence <b>the</b> amount of time an interviewer spends <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> with <b>the</b> applicant, the interviewer’s behavior and questioning of the applicant, and the interviewer’s postinterview evaluations. Preinterview impressions also can affect what the interviewer notices about the interviewee, recalls from <b>the</b> <b>interview,</b> and how an interviewer interprets what the applicant says and does <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview.</b>|$|R

500|$|While imprisoned, Kemper {{has participated}} {{in a number of}} interviews, {{including}} a segment in the 1982 documentary The Killing of America, as well as an appearance in the 1984 documentary Murder: No Apparent Motive. His interviews are notable for their contribution to understanding the mind of serial killers, with FBI profiler John E. Douglas describing Kemper as [...] "among the brightest prison inmates" [...] he ever interviewed and capable of [...] "rare insight for a violent criminal." [...] Kemper is also forthcoming about the nature of his crimes and has said that he participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews</b> to save others like himself from killing; stating {{at the end of his}} Murder: No Apparent Motive interview: [...] "There's somebody out there that is watching this and hasn't done that – hasn't killed people, and wants to, and rages inside and struggles with that feeling, or is so sure they have it under control. They need to talk to somebody about it. Trust somebody enough to sit down and talk about something that isn't a crime; thinking that way isn't a crime. Doing it isn't just a crime, it's a horrible thing, it doesn't know when to quit and it can't be stopped easily once it starts." [...] He also conducted an interview with French writer Stéphane Bourgoin in 1991.|$|E
2500|$|After graduating, Soros {{found it}} {{difficult}} to get work, and settled for a job as a traveling salesman for a fancy-goods wholesaler selling to retailers in Welsh seaside resorts. He described this period as the [...] "low point of my life," [...] and wrote letters to a number of merchant banks requesting interviews.

In a 2004 interview, Vikernes mentions that his mother [...] "is working in a large oil company".

2500|$|Waterhouse also {{published}} a {{detailed discussion of}} beliefs expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews.</b> She noted that although most people [...] "hold their belief in reincarnation quite lightly" [...] and were unclear {{on the details of}} their ideas, personal experiences such as past-life memories and near-death experiences had influenced most believers, although only a few had direct experience of these phenomena. Waterhouse analyzed the influences of second-hand accounts of reincarnation, writing {{that most of the people}} in the survey had heard other people's accounts of past-lives from regression hypnosis and dreams and found these fascinating, feeling that there [...] "must be something in it" [...] if other people were having such experiences.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the several}} memoirs {{published}} by former inmates during the post-War period, {{the most detailed}} description of the camp, according to experts, is that offered by Sara Selver-Urbach in her book Through the Window of My Home published in Israel in 1964. Selver-Urbach writes, in part,...life in Mittelsteine was sheer hell, even if a lesser hell than elsewhere, and our portion of torments and suffering was undoubtedly an indivisible part of that total, comprehensive system I have labelled [...] "A Different Planet"...Another former inmate, Ruth Minsky Sender, who in her 1986 book The Cage vividly conveys the pervasive atmosphere of terror established at Mittelsteine by the random use of torture, speaks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews</b> of the suicides among the despairing inmates.|$|E
2500|$|He also poses a {{question}} to the interviewees related to the film's title, and asks [...] "Sometimes normal people are scary to kids with autism. They talk funny or too fast.

They do" [...] and [...] "A little, yes". Cross poses the question to those with autism: [...] "What is normal anyway?". Cross interviews autistic students in the film and asks them to cite the most difficult things about their condition. Answers include [...] "making friends", [...] "driving", and [...] "making people not hate you". All students acknowledge to Cross <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews</b> that they have been teased for being different from others.|$|E
