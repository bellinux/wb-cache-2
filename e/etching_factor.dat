40|$|Abstract. The {{effectiveness}} of residual stress on forming copper patterns of {{printed circuit board}} was investigated during applied thermal conditions. Generally, the electrolytic copper foil showed a compressive residual stress about- 55 ~- 60 MPa as received, which easily caused to form copper patterns irregularly when the pattern was etched finely. The compressive residual stress was relaxed with applying heat-treatment for a few hours. However, we observed that the compressed residual stress of copper foil tended to be relaxed, constant, and compressed again during heat-treatment process, which is mainly considered as that the grain of copper is grown restrictively within a Cu thin foil layer. We suggested a quantitative method for controlling grain size, grain distribution and relaxing stress of copper foil, which was very helpful for increasing an <b>etching</b> <b>factor</b> to decrease pattern width...|$|E
40|$|Background: Silorane-based {{composites}} {{and their}} specific self-etch adhesive {{were introduced to}} conquest the polymerization shrinkage of methacrylate-based composites. It {{has been shown that}} additional etching of enamel and dentin can improve the bond strength of self-etch methacrylate-based adhesives but this claim is not apparent about silorane-based adhesives. Our objective was to compare the shear bond strength (SBS) of enamel and dentin between silorane-based adhesive resin and a methacrylate-based resin with or without additional etching. Material and Methods: 40 sound human premolars were prepared and divided into two groups: 1 - Filtek P 60 composite and Clearfil SE Bond adhesive; 2 - Filtek P 90 composite and Silorane adhesive. Each group divided into two subgroups: with or without additional etching. For additional etching, 37 % acid phosphoric was applied before bonding procedure. A cylinder of the composite was bonded to the surface. After 24 hours storage and 500 thermo cycling between 5 - 55 °C, shear bond strength was assessed with the cross head speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Then, bonded surfaces were observed under stereomicroscope to determine the failure mode. Data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Fischer exact test. Results: Shear bond strength of Filtek P 60 composite was significantly higher than Filtek P 90 composite both in enamel and dentin surfaces (p 0. 05). There was no interaction between composite type and additional etching (p > 0. 05). Failure pattern was mainly adhesive and no significant correlation was found between failure and composite type or additional etching (p > 0. 05). Conclusions: Shear bond strength of methacrylate-based composite was significantly higher than silorane-based composite both in enamel and dentin surfaces and additional etching had no significant effect on shear bond strength in enamel or dentin for each of the composites. The mode of failure had no meaningful relation to the type of composite and <b>etching</b> <b>factor...</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{preliminary}} research, one of {{the processes}} investigated for creating prototypes was ion beam proximity lithography. Ion beam proximity lithography uses stencil masks to produce patterns in ion-sensitive material (resist) which is transferred to magnetic material. The stencil mask contains a thin free standing silicon nitride membrane in which openings are formed. The pattern to be generated is first formed on a substrate that contains a photo-resist using electron beam lithography. Next the substrate is used to transfer the given pattern onto the nitride membrane (stencil mask) using the process of plasma etching. To create sufficient substrates is to maintain size uniformity of the openings which is transferred to the mask during the fabrication process (<b>etching).</b> Many <b>factors</b> contribute to the achievement and maintenance of size uniformity in the mask, such as: pressure, temperature, energy (amount of voltage), and power used when etching. To optimize the process of etching uniform patterns correctly under these parameters, the substrate {{can be used as}} a template to fabricate stencil masks of silicone nitride through the process of ion proximity beam lithography. The stencil mask can then be used as a prototype to create pattern media.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} method of {{generating}} entanglement using single photons and electron spins in the regime of resonance scattering. The technique involves matching the spontaneous emission rate of the spin dipole transition in bulk dielectric to the modified rate of spontaneous emission of the dipole coupled to the fundamental mode of an optical microcavity. We call this regime resonance scattering where interference between the input photons and those scattered by the resonantly coupled dipole transition result in a reflectivity of zero. The contrast between this and the unit reflectivity when the cavity is empty allow us to perform a non demolition measurement of the spin and to non deterministically generate entanglement between photons and spins. The chief advantage of working in the regime of resonance scattering is that the required cavity quality factors are orders of magnitude lower than is required for strong coupling, or Purcell enhancement. This makes engineering a suitable cavity much easier particularly in materials such as diamond where <b>etching</b> high quality <b>factor</b> cavities remains a significant challenge...|$|R
40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [91023043, 51105057]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [201104598]Confined etchant layer {{technique}} (CELT) is an electro- or photo-chemically induced {{chemical etching}} method for micro machining with nanometer resolution. The etching resolution can be significantly improved by {{the introduction of}} scavenging reaction, which makes CELT distinguished from conventional chemical etching or electrochemical machining. But, the scavenging reaction makes CELT have a more complicated reaction system than scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). In order to reveal the mechanism of CELT and <b>etching</b> resolution related <b>factors,</b> an axisymmetric numerical simulation model is proposed in this paper. Based on this model, the scavenging reaction, the core feature of CELT, is simulated. The simulation results of scavenger concentration's effect on the cyclic voltammetry curve (CV curve) and etching resolution are qualitatively consistent with the experiment results. It is found that the scavenging reaction and etchant's concentration distribution are dramatically affected by scavenger's concentration and the distance between the working electrode and workpiece (working distance, WD).

40|$|Objective: To compare surface {{treatments}} with CVDentUS ® ultrasound tips (UT) and KGSorensen ® diamond burs (DB) on etched (e) and non-etched (n/e) dentin. The microtensile {{bond strength}} (μTBS) was measured and fractography {{was assessed by}} scanning electron microscope (SEM). Materials and Methods: Sixteen molars were divided into four groups of four teeth each according to treatment (DB-n/e; DB-e; UT-n/e; UT-e). The teeth were restored, sectioned into samples for μTBS (n= 40) and tested on a EMIC DL- 2000 universal machine (0. 5 mm/min) and analyzed by SEM for fracture classification. Statistical Analysis: For {{analysis of the data}} on μTBS, the two-way ANOVA, using treatment and acid <b>etching</b> as fixed <b>factor,</b> and the Tukey test were used (α= 0. 05). To failures classification in cohesive in dentin (CD); cohesive in composite resin (CC); cohesive interfacial on base or top of hybrid layer (CBT); cohesive in adhesive (CA); mixed (M); interfacial on smear layer (S) the Fisher′s exact test (α= 0. 05) was performed. Results: The mean values of μTBS (in MPa) in the different groups were as follows: UT-e: 45. 31 ± 8. 16; DB-e: 34. 04 ± 9. 29; UT-n/e: 15. 17 ± 3. 71; and DB-n/e: 9. 86 ± 3. 80. On analysis of the SEM micrographs, the DB-n/e group showed total obstruction of dentinal tubules; the UT-n/e group showed partial desobstruction of dentinal tubules and irregular surface; the DB-e group showed complete desobstruction of dentinal tubules; and the UT-e group showed complete desobstruction of dentinal tubules and irregular surface. Conclusion: The combination of ultrasound treatment and acid etching provides high values of μTBS.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this {{research}} work is to characterize the Transformer Coupled Toroidal Plasma (TCTP); to understand gas phase reactions and surface reactions of neutrals in the cleaning chamber by analyzing the concentration of neutrals in downstream cleaning process chamber; {{and to make a}} global model that predicts the partial pressure of active species in the cleaning chamber. The final goal is to set-up an optimal cleaning process using the results from the experiment and the global model. The first object is to characterize the TCTP and the power consumed by plasma is measured as one approach to the characterization of plasma. MKS Astex plasma source has a very high power density. Compared to a typical industrial plasma source, the power density of the TCTP source is two orders of magnitude higher. The extremely high power density makes the plasma source very unique and its parameters very different from other plasma sources. It is discussed that there are several factors that affect the plasma power consumption. One factor is the flow rate of inlet gas and the elevated pressure due to the high flow rate of inlet gas increases the power consumption. Experimentally it is observed that the plasma power is linearly dependent upon the plasma source pressure, not upon the process chamber pressure. Another factor of controlling the power consumption is the resistivity of gases. For example, the bonding energy of N-F in NF 3 gas is different from the bonding energy of C-F bonding in C 2 F 6. Experimental result shows that C 2 F 6 + 02 gas requires more power than NF 3 gas to dissociate in the plasma due to the different resistivity. The second object is to understand gas phase reactions and surface reactions among neutrals in the cleaning chamber. The effect of nitric oxide as a silicon nitride <b>etching</b> enhancement <b>factor</b> is discussed. (cont.) It is shown that only 4. 5 % of additives (02, CO and CO 2) into NF 3 discharge doubles nitride etching rate and the enhancement of etching rate occurs regardless of the additive types. The enhancement results from the production of NO in the discharge of NF 3 gas mixture. As the amount of oxygen containing additive increases, the amount of NO increases. However, atomic fluorine decreases as the amount of oxygen containing additive increases because the additive dilutes NF 3 plasma. At low process chamber pressure, the effect of NO is offset by the dilution effect of atomic fluorine. At high pressure, addition of oxygen enhances the recombination of atomic fluorine and 25 % of 02 in NF 3 discharge decreases 54 % of atomic fluorine. Therefore, the effect of a decrease in atomic fluorine is remarkably higher than the effect of increase in the concentration of NO by adding 02 at high pressure, which leads to a decrease of nitride etching rate at 5 torr. Also, the nitride etching rates of NF 3 plasma and NF 3 /C 2 F/O 2 plasma are compared and it is shown that NF 3 /C 2 F/O 02 plasma brings better performance than NF 3 plasma in increasing the nitride etching rate. The main reason why the nitride etching rate of NF 3 /C 2 F 6 / 02 plasma is higher than that of NF 3 plasma is because nitric oxide is formed in the gas phase of NF 3 /C 2 FdO 2 plasma and the nitric oxide reacts with the nitrogen atom on the silicon nitride surface producing N 20 or N 2, while nitrogen is substituted by oxygen on the surface by the reaction. Removing nitrogen atom from silicon nitride substrate is assumed to be the rate-limiting step in the fluorine base etching of silicon nitride film. In summary, the nitric oxide makes it easier to remove the nitrogen atom from silicon nitride surface in the presence of atomic fluorine, which is the rate-limiting step for nitride etching with F base gas, therefore enhancing silicon nitride etching rate. The last object is to make a global model to predict the partial pressure of neutrals in downstream. (cont.) It is shown that incorporating kinetics into the global modeling of PECVD chamber cleaning system successfully enables the prediction of the partial pressure of atomic fluorine in NF 3 /N 2 and NF 3 / 02 discharge, which is crucial in estimating cleaning rate of TEOS film. First of all, effect of nitrogen addition in NF 3 discharge is experimentally investigated by measuring the etching rates of TEOS film and the partial pressure of neutral species. Both modeling results and experimental results make a good agreement that the addition of nitrogen in NF 3 has advantage in increasing TEOS etching rate at high chamber pressure. In other words, at high chamber pressure, TEOS etching rate is increased by adding nitrogen in NF 3 plasma. Then, the effect of oxygen in NF 3 discharge is studied. TEOS film etching rates and partial pressure of atomic fluorine in the gas phase shows that adding oxygen in NF 3 discharge increases F-F recombination, which lowers TEOS etching rate. By incorporating the above kinetics information in the global model, the partial pressure of neutral species in NF 3 / 02 discharge is successfully predicted by the global model. by Ju Jin An.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis is concerned with enhancing the etch rate of fluorine doped tin oxide (SnO_ 2 :F) under Ar/Cl_ 2 and Ar reactive ion etching conditions. The main project, involved analysing the silylation process for various silylation times, temperatures, and concentrations {{as a function of}} the photoresist etch rate in an argon plasma environment. This analysis led to the utilisation of an optimum silylation process (8 minutes at 50 deg. C 15 % Hexamethylcyclotrisilazane, HMCTS) that was found to enhance the resistance of the photoresist to <b>etching</b> by a <b>factor</b> of 12 in the 100 % argon and by a factor of 1. 8 in the argon chlorine case. The effect of silylation on the etch rate of the photoresist and tin oxide in an 90 % Ar/ 10 % Cl_ 2 plasma environment was investigated. It was found that the etch rate of the photoresist decreased whilst at the same time the etch rate of the tin oxide increased. In the 90 % Ar/ 10 % Cl_ 2 case it was observed that silylation enhanced the tin oxide etch rate by 25 % for a 150 W plasma exposure compared to the non silylated case and by #approx# 10 % compared to the non silylated case at 250 W and 350 W. A study on the etching of SnO_ 2 :F, the transparent conductive electrode for flat panel displays, using an argon plasma was carried out. Four point probe (FPP) and talystep measurements have been used to monitor changes in the resistivity and the etch rate respectively over a range of etch times and powers (up to 15. 5 minutes and 100 - 250 W). XPS experiments have been performed in order to analyse the composition of the surface layers whilst optical emission spectroscopy (OES) enabled analysis of the species present in the plasma. The XPS results show a transition from Sn(IV) to Sn(II) and subsequently to metallic Sn. OES of argon plasmas under various pump down regimes have shown the presence of hydrogen in certain conditions and this appears to affect the subsequent modification of the SnO_ 2 :F. In addition a Kelvin probe was used to measure the work function of SnO_ 2 :F, enabling the chemical and physical changes at the surface to be monitored. Essential to this analysis was the calibration of the reference brass probe of the Kelvin probe, which led to establishment of a work function value for brass of 4. 53 #+-# 0. 06 eV. Once established, utilising this work function value for brass was found to give a work function value for SnO_ 2 :F of 4. 73 #+-# 0. 05 eV. The work function of SnO_ 2 :F was then examined during argon etching in the presence of impurities for various etch times and powers. From the data recorded, it was found that the work function of SnO_ 2 :F decreased immediately upon etching, progressing towards that of metallic tin (Sn"o) with increasing etch time and power. The observed decrease in the work function of SnO_ 2 :F was ascribed to a combination of hydrogen adsorption at the surface creating a dipole layer and chemical etching of the constituent tin oxide atoms by reduction reactions producing a Sn excess. The presence of hydrogen in the short pump down (spd) but not in the lpd case indicated that hydrogen was the main species responsible for the change in the work function and resistivity and thus the effects of trace hydrogen impurities are postulated to be of significance in enhancing the etch rate of SnO_ 2 :F.
