40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} impact of The Churchill Barriers on the coastal and marine environment through analysis of nearshore and terrestrial cores using geochemical and diatom analyses, 210 Pb and 137 Cs dating and field surveying. Analyses of a core taken from near barrier 1 showed that an <b>eutrophic</b> <b>environment</b> dominated throughout the sedimentary sequence. An increase in calcium carbonate, combined with increases in strontium and sodium and a small change in diatom composition, is thought to relate to barrier construction around 1940 – 1945. A similar pattern is revealed from a core taken near barrier 4 and also from Echna Loch (Burray). On {{the east side of}} barrier 4, a large area of sand deposition has occurred {{as a result of the}} sheltered environment offered by the barrier. Sediment has been transported northwards by longshore drift and moved onshore from offshore sand bars, forming an extensive sand dune environment. The sediment deposition can be seen to a lesser extent on the east side of the barriers 1, 2 and 3.

Samples {{were collected from}} four reservoir depths in the four months; September and December 2007; and March and June 2008. The water samples for the determination of nutrients and cyanobacteria were collected using a horizontal van Dorn bottle. The samples were preserved in 4 % formaldehyde for taxonomic analysis using an optical microscope, and water aliquots were preserved in acetic Lugol solution for determination of density using an inverted microscope. High water temperatures, alkaline pH, low transparency, high phosphorous content and limited nitrogen content were found throughout the study. Dissolved oxygen stratification occurred throughout the study period whereas temperature stratification occurred in all sampling months, {{with the exception of}} June. No significant vertical differences were recorded for turbidity or total and dissolved forms of nutrients.

The First Derivative highlighted the feature around 690 nm, while most significant adjustments for field spectra were among NDVI and NIR/Red ratio and log-transformed chlorophyll-a values, with R² of 0. 78 and 0. 77, respectively. For MERIS sensor data adjustments were less significant, with R² of 0. 35 for the regression between NDVI and chlorophyll-a, possibly by interference with the signal due to the low resolution image format and narrow reservoir.

Collections were made with a plankton net of 65 micrometers mesh size. Six cladocerans species were registered: Penilia avirostris, Diaphanosoma spinulosum, Chydorus barroisi, Ceriodaphnia rigaudi, Ilyocryptus spinifer, and Moina micrura. The most frequent species was Moina micrura with 49 %. The only true marine species was Penilia avirostris, which was registered at station 1 (close to the river mouth), during high and low tide and in the dry season. The Cladocera average density decreased from 329 ind. m- 3 (August 1987, high tide) to 2 ind. m- 3 (March 1988, high tide) due to the high load of organic and chemical pollution received by the estuary. At all stations, D. spinulosum, M. micrura, and C. barroisi occurred with a wide distribution, mainly during the rainy season. C. rigaudi and I. spinifer were rare, occurring only during the rainy season.

Hierarchical classifications were performed from morphological and biochemical tests of 343 heterotrophic bacterial strains isolated from the two sites and for each habitat. Despite differences in trophic status, numerical taxonomic analysis of the pelagic bacterial strains (n = 165) showed a dominant cluster (72 % of strains) of mixed origin (close to 50 % of isolates from each site). The majority of these strains were non-fermentative rods producing neither amino-acids decarboxylases, nor acid from any carbohydrates. In the more eutrophic site (Layo), few differences of properties were observed between pelagic and periphyton-associated bacteria. On the contrary, a large part of bacteria isolated from bamboo at Kpass was characterized by specific particularities such as the degradation of arginine, tryptophan and citrate. Numerical taxonomic analysis allowed the distinguishing of specific characteristics of bacteria according to the habitat. Our results suggest that hydrological and biological conditions (especially photosynthetic exudates from periphyton) may induce an obvious specialization of the periphytic bacteria in the less eutrophic ecosystem (Kpass) compared to the bacteria isolated from the more <b>eutrophic</b> <b>environment</b> (Layo).

40|$|Abstract. Human {{interventions}} have drastically {{altered the}} hydrologic regime of the Razelm - Sinoe Lagoon System. Over {{the past four}} decades, following {{the closure of the}} main inlet (Gura Portiței) and the engineering of the other main communication inlets and channels, significant changes have occurred in the hydrological regime. This major disruption of the water and sediment circulation generated, at its turn, significant changes of the water chemistry, biology and lagoon ecosystems, transforming the system in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>environment</b> with all related consequences. Due to the significant decrease in sediment load transported along the coastal zone, the barrier beach separating the Lagoon System from the Black Sea is almost entirely subject to coastal erosion. Environmental improvement and rehabilitation is already a major demand of the local communities. Nevertheless, environmental recovery plans must be based on the detailed understanding of the water circulation in the lagoon system. This can be achieved only by the involvement of numerical modelling. Simulations have been performed using the hydrodynamic model SHYFEM, in order to obtain a response of the Razelm - Sinoe Lagoon System to the main forcings. The results show that the salinity distribution in the Lagoon System is, mainly, controlled by the freshwater discharge and, secondly, by wind, which can intensify the freshwater input. The calculated renewal times of the Razelm - Sinoe Lagoon System are very high, over one year, and classify the lagoon as a chocked system.

Surface sediments were also collected {{in order to determine}} the levels of organic contaminants in the gulf. Three main water masses were identified in the Strymonikos Gulf throughout the year: a) the surface river plume water, b) the surface and subsurface Black Sea Water and c) the near bottom (> 50 m) water of Levantine origin. High nutrient concentrations were recorded close to the mouth of the river, indicating a rather <b>eutrophic</b> <b>environment,</b> which was restricted near the river discharge. The salinity-nutrient correlations of the surface waters of the study area were linear, indicating that the riverine waters are the major source of nutrient in the gulf. DIN:P ratios varied seasonally from relatively higher values during winter and early spring to lower values in late spring-early summer. This led to a shift from likelihood P-limitation during winter and early spring to N-limitation in late spring – early summer. Total hydrocarbon concentrations measured in the sediments ranged from 19. 2 to 95. 9 Ìg/g, whereas total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) values varied between 107. 2 and 1019 ng/g. The application of different diagnostic criteria suggests a natural terrestrial origin for aliphatic hydrocarbons and pyrolytic origin for the PAHs.

From the coastal station and upstream the estuary; TEP concentrations, β-glucosidase activity, bacterial production and abundance have gradually increased. TEP were often found as bio-aggregates, scaffolding algae, detritus matter and bacteria that likely formed hotspots for enhance microbial activity. To further demonstrate the link between TEP and heterotrophic bacterial activity, confined incubations with ambient and polysaccharide-enriched estuary water were carried out. Following polysaccharide addition, elevated (~ 50 %) β-glucosidase activity rates were observed, leading to TEP hydrolysis. This newly formed bioavailable carbon resulted in significantly higher growth rates, with up to a 5 -fold increase in heterotrophic bacterial biomass, comprising mostly high nucleic acid content bacteria. Taking together {{the findings from this}} research, we conclude that even in highly <b>eutrophic</b> <b>environments</b> heterotrophic bacteria may still be carbon limited. Further, TEP as a polysaccharide matrix can act as a metabolic surrogate, adding fresh bioavailable carbon through tight associations with bacteria in eutrophic ecosystems such as the Qishon estuary...|$|R
40|$|The Ibirit&# 233; {{reservoir}} is {{an urban}} and <b>eutrophic</b> <b>environment,</b> with regular occurrences of cyanobacteria blooms. The reservoir is warm monomict and remains stratified {{most of the}} year, circulating in the dry season (winter). During the hydrological cycle of October/ 07 to October/ 08 there were four scenarios with different environmental conditions, which influenced {{the structure of the}} zooplankton community, as confirmed in a previous study. Changes in the zooplankton community structure between the scenarios were studied, aiming at analyzing the stability and persistence of this community. The Spearman&# 8217;s coefficient of correlation was used to measure the stability; the persistence was evaluated through a cluster analysis and changes in community composition were estimated by the "temporal" &# 946; diversity index. Considering the distribution patterns of abundance, the community was stable only in the transition between scenarios 1 and 2 (n = 30, r = 0. 71, p = 0. 00001), when there were no cyanobacteria blooms. The persistence of zooplankton between the scenarios was low, showing a distinct species composition for each scenario. The highest variations in species composition, observed by the values of temporal &# 946; diversity index, were the transitions between scenarios 3 - 0 (1. 45) and 0 - 1 (1. 05), and the lowest variations occurred in the transition between scenarios 1 - 2 (0. 57). The results suggest that the cyanobacteria blooms at Ibirit&# 233; reservoir are be acting as "selective filters", and are, thus, disturbances with sufficient ability to change the structure of the zooplankton community.

40|$|The pollen, spore {{and organic}} walled dinoflagelletas cyst {{associations}} of two marine sediment cores from the Java Sea off {{the mouths of}} Jelai River (South Kalimantan) and Solo River (East Java) reflect environment and vegetation changes during the last ca 3500 years in the region. A decline in primary forest taxa (e. g. Agathis, Allophylus, Dacrycarpus, Dacrydium, Dipterocarpaceae, Phyllocladus, and Podocarpus) suggest that the major change in vegetation {{is caused by the}} forest canopy opening that can be related to human activity. The successively increase of pollen of pioneer canopy and herb taxa (e. g. Acalypha, Ficus, Macaranga/Mallotus, Trema, Pandanus) indicate the development of a secondary vegetation. In Java these changes started much earlier (ca at 2950 cal yr BP) then in Kalimantan (ca at 910 cal yr BP) and seem to be more severe. Changes in the marine realm, reflected by the dinoflagellate cyst association correspond to changes in vegetation on land. They reflect a gradual change from relatively well ventilated to more hypoxic bottom/pore water conditions in a more <b>eutrophic</b> <b>environment.</b> Near the coast of Java, the shift of the water trophic status took place between ca 820 and 500 cal yrs BP, while near the coast of Kalimantan it occurred as late as {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century. We observe an increasing amount of the cyst of Polykrikos schwarzii, cyst of P. kofoidii, Lingulodinium machaerophorum, Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus and Selenopemphix nephroides at times of secondary vegetation development on land, suggesting that these species react strongly on human induced changes in the marine environment, probably related to increased pollution and eutrophication...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this present}} study was to {{describe}} environmental parameters along the Gulf of California(23 °N to 29 °N), and understand and analyze how they determine the presence and structure of coral communities. Here, high latitude non-framework coral communities thrive in limiting environmental factors. Three sites were used to illustrate changes in temperature, nutrients, and coral species diversity along an increasing latitude gradient. Bahia de Los Angelesto the north maintains monotypic colonies of Porites sp. in a cooler, <b>eutrophic</b> <b>environment,</b> while species diversity and temperature increased to the south in mesotrophic and oligotrophic conditions. The majority of zooxanthellate species present in the Gulf of California have Indo-Pacific origin, with the possibility of Porites sverdrupi being generated by allopatric speciation. Regional oceanographic conditions in theGulf of California determine community structure, more than biological factors. Coral communities are sporadically affected by hurricanes with an average frequency of 0. 62 hurricane/yr, within a radius of 100 km. Sea-surface temperatures records for the period of 136 years from the HADISST 1 data set were correlated to warm related bleaching events in the Gulf in 1982 - 83 and 1997 - 98, and to cold related bleaching in 1989. The coral communities of theGulf of California suffered moderate bleaching and mortalities in 1997 - 1998 (ENSO), even when this event {{is considered one of the}} strongest events in the century. Hurricanes and ENSO events appear to be attenuated in an increasing latitude gradient in the Gulf. Overall, the analysis indicates that the structure of coral communities in theGulf of California are dominated more by regional oceanography, than perhaps large-scale oceanographic/atmospheric events...|$|E
40|$|The {{regulation}} of bacterial community biomass and productivity by resources and predators {{is a central}} concern {{in the study of}} microbial food webs. Resource or bottom-up regulation refers to the limitation of bacteria by carbon and nutrients derived from allocthonous inputs, primary production, and heterotrophic production. Predatory or top-down regulation refers to the limitation of bacteria below levels supportable by resources alone. Large scale comparative studies demonstrate strong correlations between bacterial productivity and biomass, suggesting significant resource regulation. Comparisons of the abundances of heterotrophic flagellates and bacteria, however, imply that in some cases there may be top-down {{regulation of}} bacteria in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>environments.</b> Experimental studies in lakes support the importance of resource regulation and reveal little top-down control from protozoans. Increases in bacterial abundance and production with nutrient enrichment were limited in enclosure experiments with high abundances of the cladoceran, Daphnia. Regulation of bacteria by Daphnia may occur in many lakes seasonally and prevail in some lakes throughout the year where these animals sustain dense populations. In most situations, however, bacteria appear to be limited primarily by resources...|$|R
40|$|The {{calcareous}} sponge Paraleucilla magna {{has been}} detected at different Mediterranean sites (Taranto, Porto Cesarco, Brindisi and Naples). Its record in well studied areas where several benthic surveys have previously {{been carried out}} suggests a recent introduction of the species into the Mediterranean Sea. Until now this sponge has only been recorded from the Brazilian coast. It shows different morphologies, varying from tubular to an irregular massive shape with several folds occurring on its surface. The colour is white-cream. The surface is smooth. The consistency is friable. The oscula are 10 - 20 mm in diameter and located {{at the top of}} tubular protrusions. The skeleton consists of cortical and subatrial triactines and tetractines, together with atrial triactines, differently distributed in the sponge body. Paraleucilla magna is abundant in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>environments,</b> where seasonally it may reach very high frequency values and large dimensions. It is resistant to pollution, but it is also able to live in clean waters. The inclusion of this species among Mediterranean alien invasive species is suggested...|$|R
