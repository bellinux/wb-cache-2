The new goal {{was to find a}} new surface geometry that would combine the excellent diffusion characteristics of MLS designs with wider bandwidth. A new design was discovered, called a quadratic-residue <b>diffusor.</b> Today the quadratic residue <b>diffusor</b> or Schroeder <b>diffusor</b> is still widely used. Quadratic-Residue Diffusors can be designed to diffuse sound in either one or two directions. They too suffer from [...] "flat plate" [...] frequencies, but at a higher frequencies than MLS diffusors. Fractal constructions can be used to extend bandwidth.|$|E

The numerical simulations have been performed with a sound particles tracing based code, which allows to model the sound reflection, diffusion and absorption by building façades with any arrangement of acoustic <b>diffusors.</b> Several parameters have been studied, among which, the diffusion pattern, the relative surface on the façades, the arrangement {{and the size of}} <b>diffusors.</b> In addition, the combined effect of absorption and diffusion by <b>diffusors</b> has also been investigated. The numerical results show that a significant noise reduction can be observed on the sound attenuation {{as well as on the}} sound decay in a street, by considering <b>diffusors</b> creating uniform diffusion, with a relative surface larger than 20 %, and if possible locating on the lower part of the façades.

50|$|Diffusors (or diffusers) {{are used}} to treat sound aberrations in rooms such as echoes. They are an {{excellent}} alternative or complement to sound absorption {{because they do not}} remove sound energy, but can be used to effectively reduce distinct echoes and reflections while still leaving a live sounding space. Compared to a reflective surface, which will cause most of the energy to be reflected off at an angle equal to the angle of incidence, a <b>diffusor</b> will cause the sound energy to be radiated in many directions, hence leading to a more diffusive acoustic space. It is also important that a <b>diffusor</b> spreads reflections in time as well as spatially. Diffusors can aid sound diffusion, but this is not why they are used in many cases; they are more often used to remove coloration and echoes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{contrast}} to imaging optics <b>diffusors</b> are typically used to achieve homogeneous luminance distributions for display and lighting applications. For example, LEDs are nearly point sources and therefore optical beam shaping components are needed. Optical <b>diffusors</b> in reflection and transmission {{are commonly used}} for additional luminance homogenization. However, a detailed quantitative understanding and numerical description of their optical performance are very unconfident or still unclear. In this contribution we focus on volume <b>diffusors</b> and present results on three types of particle-matrix-material combinations. The measured straylight distributions are compared to theoretical predictions and show good agreement. From these results optimized material parameters can be derived {{in order to get}} improved volume diffusers for tailored luminance distributions...|$|R

The angular scattering profile of bulk scattering diffusing materials is determined by three bulk scattering parameters which are however not commonly available.

In this paper, the bulk scattering parameters of a concentration series of milk diluted with water were determined with the inverse adding-doubling method. Using these values as input, the macroscopic angular scattering profile was simulated using ray tracing software.
