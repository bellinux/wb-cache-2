Although Holden's involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of large cars in Australia led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability. Since 2010 Holden has incurred losses due to the strong Australian dollar, and government grants have been reduced. This led to the announcement on 11 December 2013 that Holden will cease vehicle and engine production {{by the end of}} 2017, however, the company will continue to have a large and ongoing presence in Australia importing and selling cars as national sales company.

40|$|The School of Engineering at Deakin University has {{embarked}} on a new path in engineering education with new learning model based on the principles of project based learning and design based learning. Design based learning is the driving force for the new learning model which also incorporates the principles from project based learning to deliver the skills and knowledge students require to understand and solve design problems. The new project and <b>design</b> <b>centred</b> curriculum was implemented in a third year engineering unit. This paper presents the student views on this process, their views on the knowledge transfer and the knowledge gained through this process. PURPOSE This paper focuses on the student perspectives on the project and <b>design</b> <b>centred</b> curriculum. DESIGN/METHOD This research study will illustrate the students&# 039; views on the project and <b>design</b> <b>centred</b> curriculum. The student experience of the new curriculum will be evaluated using the course experience questionnaire. The questionnaire provides the students evaluation of the teaching and the units RESULTS The analysis of the survey results will give the researchers feedback on the new curriculum in the particular unit. It will also give them an insight if the method has helped students understand the subject and it concepts better and if the approach has helped collaboration between the students and their peers. CONCLUSIONS Project based learning and design based learning approaches have been applied {{in a wide range of}} situations and it is known to simulate discussion and collaboration between the students. A new project and <b>design</b> <b>centred</b> curriculum has been applied to a third year engineering units looks at students using a self-directed approach to gain knowledge in the area and also teaching and disseminating the knowledge to their peers and colleagues. The analysis of this process will give the effectiveness of the process and inform the school of engineering of any improvements needed...|$|R

Hayek pushed for a hybrid drivetrain but the final product used a relatively conventional gasoline engine. Shortly afterward Daimler-Benz bought out SMH's remaining stake in the company. MCC was now a wholly owned subsidiary of Daimler-Benz (which soon merged with Chrysler Corporation to become DaimlerChrysler).

40|$|Abstract. Evolutionary {{computing}} and algorithms {{are well}} known tools of optimisation that are utilized for various areas of analogue electronic circuits design and diagnosis. This paper presents {{the possibility of using}} two evolutionary algorithms – genetic algorithm and evolutionary strategies – for the purpose of analogue circuits yield and cost optimisation. Terms: technologic and parametric yield are defined. Procedures of parametric yield optimisation, such as a <b>design</b> <b>centring,</b> a <b>design</b> tolerancing, a <b>design</b> <b>centring</b> with tolerancing, are introduced. Basics of genetic algorithm and evolutionary strategies are presented, differences between these two algorithms are highlighted, certain aspects of implementation are discussed. Effectiveness of both algorithms in parametric yield optimisation has been tested on several examples and results have been presented. A share of evolutionary algorithms computation cost in a total optimisation cost is analyzed...|$|R
