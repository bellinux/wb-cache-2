25|$|The hemeralopic {{aspect of}} ACHM can be {{diagnosed}} non-invasively using electroretinography. The response at low (scotopic) and median (mesotopic) light levels will be normal but the response under high light level (photopic) conditions will be absent. The mesotopic level is approximately 100 times {{lower than the}} clinical level used for the typical high level <b>electroretinogram.</b> When as described, the condition {{is due to a}} saturation in the neural portion of the retina and not due to the absence of the photoreceptors per se.|$|E
2500|$|Functional tests [...] {{may include}} <b>electroretinogram</b> and visual field testing. [...] Diagnostic {{confirmation}} and an estimation of disease severity may involve imaging tests such as retinography, fluorescein or indocyanine green angiography, {{optical coherence tomography}} and ultrasound. For example, indocyanine green angiography may detect continuing choroidal inflammation in the eyes without clinical symptoms or signs. Ocular MRI may be helpful and auditory symptoms should undergo audiologic testing. Histopathology findings from eye and skin are discussed by Walton.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{mutation}} in the rhodopsin structural protein, specifically peripherin 2 {{which is a}} membrane glycoprotein involved {{in the formation of}} photoreceptor outersegment disk, can lead to recessive RP and macular degeneration in human (19).

[...] The result showed improvement in photoreceptor structure and function which was detected by ERG (<b>electroretinogram).</b> The result showed improvement of photoreceptor structure and function which was detected by ERG. Also peripherin 2 was detected at the outer segment layer of the retina 2 weeks after injection and therapeutic effects were noted as soon as 3 weeks after injection.

Eight affected members of this family were studied electrophysiologically and psychophysically with dark adapted static threshold perimetry and dark adaptometry. The phenotypes observed fell into three categories: minimally affected with no symptoms, and normal (or near normal) electrophysiology and psychophysics; moderately affected with mild symptoms, abnormal <b>electroretinograms,</b> and equal loss of rod and cone function in affected areas of the retina; and severely affected with extinguished <b>electroretinograms</b> and barely detectable dark adapted static threshold sensitivities.

50|$|Electrooculography (EOG/E.O.G.) is a {{technique}} for measuring the corneo-retinal standing potential that exists between the front {{and the back of}} the human eye. The resulting signal is called the electrooculogram. Primary applications are in ophthalmological diagnosis and in recording eye movements. Unlike the <b>electroretinogram,</b> the EOG does not measure response to individual visual stimuli.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis of AIR can be {{difficult}} due to the overlap of symptoms with other disorders. Examination of the fundus (inner surface of eye) can show no results or it can show narrowing of the blood vessels, abnormal colouration of the optic disc, and retinal atrophy. Fundus examination results are not indicative of autoimmune retinopathy but {{they are used to}} initiate the diagnostic process. An <b>electroretinogram</b> (eye test used to see abnormalities in the retina) is used to detect AIR. An abnormal <b>electroretinogram</b> (ERG) with respect to light and dark adaptations indicates AIR. The ERG also allows differentiation between cancer-associated retinopathy and melanoma-associated retinopathy. If the ERG shows cone responses, CAR can be prematurely diagnosed. If the ERG shows a significant decrease in b-wave amplitude, MAR can be prematurely diagnosed. To confirm, analysis for anti-retinal antibodies through Western blotting of serum collected from the patient is done.|$|E

50|$|Gunnar Svaetichin (1915-1981) was a Swedish-Finnish-Venezuelan {{physiologist}} who, in 1956, showed {{by examining}} the external layers of fish retinas that <b>electroretinograms</b> display particular sensitivity to three different groups of wavelengths {{in the areas of}} blue, green and red. This provided the first biological demonstration in support of the Young-Helmholtz trichromatic theory. He also gave name to the S-potential, which was the first experimental evidence that opponency existed in the visual system.|$|R

This unique capability, not shared by other photoreceptors, could serve as a {{reference}} for the visual system to optimize light adaptation. Indeed, melanopsin has been found to regulate cone <b>electroretinograms</b> (ERGs) in mice [37] or humans [38]. More recently, it is reported that melanopsin activation level can modulate the spatial/temporal tuning patterns of visual network [36].|$|R
50|$|Pikachurin, {{along with}} laminin, perlecan, agrin, neurexin, binds to α-dystroglycan in the {{extracellular}} space. As such, pikachurin, {{as well as}} the other previously-mentioned proteins, is necessary for the proper functioning of dystroglycan. Pikachurin is necessary for the apposition of presynaptic and postsynaptic termini in the ribbon synapse; deletion of pikachurin causes an abnormal <b>electroretinogram,</b> similarly to the deletion of nestin.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSilent {{substitution}} {{and selective}} adaptation techniques {{were used to}} obtain full field S-cone and L+M-cone <b>electroretinograms</b> from 18 patients with ocular hypertension (OHT), 9 with normotensive glaucoma (NTG), 18 with early primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and 19 normal controls. Pattern <b>electroretinograms</b> were also recorded, using a reduced check size to increase the contribution of retinal ganglion cells. In the OHT and POAG groups, statistically significant reductions (P= 0. 05 – 0. 001) were observed in the amplitudes, most notably in the late negative waves of all three types of ERG compared to the controls. These are thought to reflect ganglion cell activity. The results imply a diffusely distributed loss of activity (20 – 35 %) affecting many retinal pathways to a similar extent in OHT and early POAG, with an additional amount (< 5 %) in POAG corresponding approximately to the loss associated with local field defects. The electrophysiology indicated that virtually all cases of untreated OHT have greater retinal dysfunction than the least affected cases of POAG. The NTG group showed a different pattern of loss in that the PERG was markedly affected but the S-cone ERG was not significantly reduced...|$|R
50|$|Cone monochromacy {{is a rare}} total color {{blindness}} that {{is accompanied}} by relatively normal vision, <b>electroretinogram,</b> and electrooculogram. Cone monochromacy {{can also be a}} result of having more than one type of dichromatic color blindness. People who have, for instance, both protanopia and tritanopia are considered to have cone monochromacy. Since cone monochromacy is the lack of/damage of more than one cone in retinal environment, having two types of dichromacy would be an equivalent.|$|E
