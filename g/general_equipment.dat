5|$|The Z-3 formed part of {{the bomber}} {{versions}} of the Z series, it was, however, also used as a reconnaissance aircraft by the staff flight of the particular unit. The engines and the <b>general</b> <b>equipment</b> were identical to the Z-2 standard; however two cameras — the Rb 50/30 and Rb 20/30 - were incorporated into the crew entry hatch. A handheld camera was issued to the crew to validate the success during bombing missions. Autopilot equipment was added later. The Z-2 and Z-3 were identical visually, and could only be distinguished from each other by the altered crew hatch on the Z-3. Owing to spacing problems because of the added camera equipment, the ammunition supply was reduced from 44 to 42 magazines. The power plant of the Z-3 was upgraded to the Bramo 323P-2. The Bramo P-2 remained the engine of all the remaining Z series variants.|$|E

500|$|American {{inventor}} Schuyler Wheeler patented {{an electric}} fire engine {{system in the}} United States in 1885. He filed his invention in 1882 and the patent was issued in 1885. The system included electrical infrastructure, with electric motor driven water pumps, on a horse drawn vehicle. The fire-engine vehicle was designed with the same <b>general</b> <b>equipment</b> as a regular steam fire engine of the time, but used electrically operated equipment instead of steam power. It was designed with an electrical regulator, and a switch for the main electric motor that drove the water pump, that pushed water through the fire-hoses used {{to put out the}} fire.|$|E
60|$|I {{have made}} many {{observations}} lately upon {{the structure of}} the vessel. Although well armed, she is not, I think, a ship of war. Her rigging, build, and <b>general</b> <b>equipment,</b> all negative a supposition of this kind. What she is not, I can easily perceive--what she is I fear it is impossible to say. I know not how it is, but in scrutinizing her strange model and singular cast of spars, her huge size and overgrown suits of canvas, her severely simple bow and antiquated stern, there will occasionally flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things, and there is always mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection, an unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago.|$|E

Untwining his gold chain from his neck, Balafre twisted off, with his firm and strong set teeth, about four inches from the one end of it, and said to his attendant, [...] "Here, Andrew, carry this to my gossip, jolly Father Boniface, the monk of St. Martin's; greet him well from me, {{by the same token}} that he could not say God save ye when we last parted at midnight.--Tell my gossip that my brother and sister, and some others of my house, are all dead and gone, and I pray him to say masses for their souls as far as the value of these links will carry him, and to do on trust what else may be necessary to free them from Purgatory. And hark ye, as they were just living people, and free from all heresy, it may be that they are well nigh out of limbo already, so that a little matter may have them free of the fetlocks; and in that case, look ye, ye will say I desire to take out the balance of the gold in curses upon a generation called the Ogilvies of Angus Shire, in what way soever the church may best come at them. You understand all this, Andrew?" ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{the first}} of many departures from London, where you are always more or less {{arriving}} or departing as long as you remain in England. It is indeed an axiom with the natives {{that if you want to}} go from any one point to any other in the island it is easier to come to London and start afresh for it, than to reach the point across country. The trains to and from the capital are swifter and more frequent, and you are not likely to lose your way in the mazes of Bradshaw if you consult the indefinitely simplified A B C tables which instruct you how to launch yourself direct from London upon any objective, or to recoil from it. My impression is that you habitually drive to a London station as nearly in time to take your train as may be, and that there is very little use for waiting-rooms. This may be why the waiting-room seems so small and unattractive a part of the <b>general</b> <b>equipment.</b> It never bears any such proportion to the rest as the waiting-rooms in the great Boston stations, or even that of the Grand Central in New York, and is by no chance so really fine as that of the Atchison and Topeka at Omaha, or that of the Lake Shore at Pittsburg. Neither the management nor the climate is so unkind as to keep intending passengers from the platforms, where they stand talking, or walk up and down, or lean from their carriage-doors and take leave of attendant friends with repeated pathos. With us it is either too cold or too hot to do that, and at all the great stations we are now fenced off from the tracks, as on the Continent, and unless we can make favor with the gateman, must despatch our farewells before our parting dear ones press forward to have their tickets punched. But at no London station, and far less at any provincial station in England, are you subjected to these formalities; and the English seem to linger out their farewells almost abusively, especially if they are young and have much of life before them.|$|E

Secondly, {{with the help of}} Matlab and Photoshop, the surface glossiness of the fruit or vegetable is gained. Thirdly, moisture content of a fruit or vegetable is measured through infrared moisture meter. Meanwhile, a Mathematical Model in Regression Analysis between the R value and the moisture content is established. Lastly, the non-linear relation between surface glossiness and moisture content of the fruit is found. Therefore, a new method about measuring the moisture content of fruits or vegetables through <b>general</b> photographic <b>equipments</b> is sought out...|$|R
