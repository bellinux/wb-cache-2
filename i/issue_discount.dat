40|$|An {{analysis}} of 4, 814 SEOs during 1986 - 1999 {{indicates that the}} average offering of new shares is priced at a discount of 3. 0 % from the closing price {{on the day before}} the <b>issue.</b> <b>Discounts</b> have risen steadily over time, sharply increasing the indirect costs of issuing seasoned equity. There is evidence of increased clustering of offer prices at integers, and of greater importance in the analyst coverage provided by underwriters. Adjusting for other factors, we find that issues with integer offer prices, and underwriters with highly regarded analysts, are increasingly associated with larger discounts. The rise in discounts is consistent with an increased ability of investment bankers to extract rents from issuing firms...|$|R
50|$|The {{portion of}} the loan that is repaid {{consists}} of a repayment of capital and a payment of interest. Original <b>issue</b> <b>discount</b> rules separate the {{portion of the}} repayment that is attributable to interest and then taxes that amount at ordinary income rates. These rules prevent the avoidance of tax that might otherwise be available by characterizing the repayment as a capital gain, which is taxed at a lower rate, or by deferring the recognition of income until the bond is repaid at maturity.|$|E
50|$|Original <b>Issue</b> <b>Discount</b> (OID) {{is a type}} of {{interest}} that is not payable as it accrues. OID is normally created when a debt, usually a bond, is issued at a discount. In effect, selling a bond at a discount converts stated principal into a return on investment, or interest. The accurate determination of principal and interest is necessary in United States tax law to determine the basis of property and to determine whether an amount paid is deductible and includible as interest, or simply a nontaxable debt repayment.|$|E
50|$|The {{methods and}} {{procedures}} by which municipal debt is issued are governed by an extensive system of laws and regulations, which vary by state.

If a bond measure is proposed in a local election, a Tax Rate Statement may be provided to voters, detailing best estimates of the tax rate required to levy and fund the bond. In cases where no election is held, depending on applicable local law, voters may be entitled to petition the approval to referendum (i.e., a public vote) within a specified period of time; bonds are typically not issued prior to the expiration of any such referendum period.|$|E

40|$|We use daily short-selling data {{to examine}} whether short selling around {{seasoned}} equity offerings (SEOs) reflects informed or manipulative trading. Around SEO announcements, we find no evidence of informed short selling. Around issue dates, higher levels of pre-issue short selling are significantly related to larger <b>issue</b> <b>discounts</b> for non-shelf-registered offerings. This evidence is consistent with manipulative trading. We show that SEC Rule 105 constrains some but not all manipulative trading. Our results reverse previous research that uses monthly short-interest data, because daily data allow more powerful tests. Our evidence helps explain the increased popularity of shelf registrations. Although short selling usually enhances price efficiency, we document a situation where short selling reduces price efficiency. The Author 2010.

50|$|The {{alternative}} is to elect out of the installment method. In that case, the seller reports the fixed amounts (taking original <b>issue</b> <b>discount</b> into account for future fixed payments) plus the fair {{market value of the}} right to contingent payments. The taxpayer pays tax up front in the year of the sale on this total amount realized. The taxpayer then has a basis in the right to contingent payments equal to the amount reported as fair market value. The good news here is that the seller gets a little piece of the open transaction doctrine, and may fully recover basis in the contingent piece of the sale before reporting any additional contingent payments in future years. Where the profit ratio would have been high anyway and the fair market value of the contingent payments are low, the taxpayer may experience favorable consequences by effectively paying a little more tax up front and in return getting the first crop of contingent payments tax-free, while eliminating the risk of an unusable future capital loss.|$|E

Some cite this view to shift the policy emphasis from entitlement cost control to the restructuring of the U. S. health sector, including private health care. But this new consensus is flawed. Using standard accounting practices and including all major government entitlement programs, population aging will play an equal role with health care cost growth over the next seventy-five years and a significantly larger role than health spending {{over the next few}} decades.

50|$|Purchasers of {{municipal}} bonds {{should be aware}} that not all municipal bonds are tax-exempt, and not all tax-exempt bonds are exempt from all federal and state taxes. The laws governing the taxability {{of municipal}} bond income are complex. At the federal level they are contained in the IRS Code (Sections 103, 141-150), and rules promulgated thereunder. Additionally, special rules apply to certain types of investors (e.g., financial institution and property and casualty insurance companies) or in certain situations. For example, there is no IRS Code exemption for capital or other gains received from the sale of a municipal bonds and special rules apply for secondary market discount and original <b>issue</b> <b>discount</b> on municipal bonds. Each state will have its own laws governing what bonds, if any, are exempt from state taxes. For publicly offered bonds and most private placements, at the time of issuance a legal opinion will be provided indicating that the interest bonds are tax-exempt; these opinions do not customarily address collateral tax treatment. Offering documents, such as an official statement or placement memorandum, will contain further information regarding tax treatment of interest on the bonds. Investors {{should be aware that}} there are also post-issuance compliance requirements that must be met to ensure that the bonds remain tax-exempt. The IRS has a specific section of their website, www.irs.gov, devoted to tax exempt bonds and compliance with federal requirements.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{mathematical}} principles {{behind the}} taxation of bonds and other securities {{in the form}} of debt instruments are elucidated. The main tax rules of current importance in portfolio management in the United States are sorted out and expressed in formulas as an aid to financial modeling and computerization. As a foundation, the theory of constant yield to maturity is developed with generality ample enough to cover situations where the dates on which interest is compounded may not be equally spaced. Various inconsistencies are identified in the approaches to tax computation embodied in current regulations, such as the method of fractional exponents and the way of characterizing original <b>issue</b> <b>discount</b> or premium. Consistent alternatives to these approaches are proposed...|$|E

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of over 3, 000 {{seasoned}} equity offerings (SEOs) from 1983 to 1998, we test {{the hypothesis that the}} U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 10 b- 21, which disallows the covering of short positions with newly issued SEOs, makes pre-offer stock prices less informative, which, in turn, causes the new seasoned equity to be priced at a discount. Consistent with the hypothesis, we find that the year the rule went into effect coincides with the year from which we begin observing significant SEO discounts. Further, we find that "ex ante" uncertainty and SEO discounts are positively related. We also conduct tests specifically related to short selling, and we also consider an exhaustive set of alternative explanations for the discounts. Based on all of the evidence, we conclude that it is the rule that makes <b>issue</b> <b>discounts</b> larger in the 1990 s. Copyright 2004 by the Eastern Finance Association. ...|$|R

40|$|Share {{purchase}} plans (SPPs) {{are offered}} exclusively to a company’s registered shareholders, who may purchase up to $ 5, 000 worth of shares in a 12 -month period {{at a discount}} to the market price and without any brokerage charge. They have {{become one of the}} most frequently used mechanisms for raising publicly traded equity capital in Australia, yet little is known about them from a financial markets perspective. We address this deficiency by documenting the characteristics of Australian firms that have adopted SPPs and assessing their short-term and long-term valuation implications. We find that SPPs are more likely to be issued by firms with lower levels of liquidity and relatively large numbers of shareholders. They have a negative announcement effect, which is associated with the size of the issue, the prior share-price runup, the issue-price discount, the firm’s industry, and whether there is enough time for non-shareholders to buy shares in order to participate. Long-run underperformance is also found over extended periods, consistent with much of the seasoned equity offering (SEO) literature. The SPP-issuer did not perform as badly if it was in the mining industry, if it was audited by a ‘Big-N ’ firm, or if the issue was underwritten. Conversely, the greater the <b>issue</b> <b>discount,</b> the worse the issuer’s long-run performance. Keywords...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} reports {{an application}} of Critical Realist methodology {{to the problem of}} identifying the causal relationships between corporate finance and industrial investment. The study employs both econometric analysis of aggregate time-series data for the UK and US for the period 1952 - 2001 and other quantitative methods, including an analysis of individual cashflow statements, as well as qualitative studies of the annual reports and financial statements of individual firms. The econometric analysis consists mainly of the estimation and testing of single equation and vector error correction models based on a co-integrating relationship. The aggregate data reveal the anomaly that large industrial firms invariably use equity markets to finance business acquisitions but not capital formation. This can be explained by a differential new equity <b>issue</b> <b>discount</b> based on a fresh interpretation of Keynes’s analysis of liquidity preference under fundamental uncertainty. This account makes an important link between the theories of Keynes and Kalecki. The resulting hypothesis is tested and confirmed by an individual study of all 217 new issues over £ 1 m made by continuing UK listed industrial companies in 1999. The thesis concludes that public policy and future research on aggregate investment will be more fruitful if based upon the Post Keynesian understanding of uncertainty, although this requires a major reconsideration of current standard theoretical and empirical methodologies. A distinctive conclusion is that econometric analysis can reveal the detailed nature of regular patterns grounded in conventional behaviour and institutions, but must not be used uncritically in the framing and testing of economic hypotheses...|$|E
