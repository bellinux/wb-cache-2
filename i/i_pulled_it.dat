25|$|I saw Owen and {{the other}} two players put their head in their hands and fired {{thinking}} it would perhaps do as a dejection pic. To be honest, had it happened earlier in the game when I had more time and things were less frantic, I probably would have deleted it as you couldn't make out the faces on the crowd {{on the back of the}} camera, and it was only when <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> up on the laptop later that I realised what I had.|$|E
500|$|The play had Nagesh {{himself in}} the title role, along with Major Sundarrajan and S. N. Lakshmi who reprised their roles in the film. Balachander {{recalled}} in 2009 that when he wrote Server Sundaram with Nagesh in mind, he suffered anxious moments: [...] "I was convinced of the story, {{but there was a}} risk in promoting Nagesh, but <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> off". A. V. Meiyappan, the founder of AVM Productions, acquired the rights to the play and also shared Krishnan–Panju's wish to make a film based on it. The film adaptation was produced by Guhan Films, a subsidiary of AVM. Balachander was recruited as the film's screenplay and dialogue writer. Krishnan–Panju directed the film, although Balachander had shown a keen interest in directing it himself. Meiyappan accepted the inclusion of Nagesh in the film after watching the latter's performance in the play. Nagesh, who in turn was impressed with S. N. Lakshmi's performance in the play, asked Balachander to have Meiyappan include her in the film. K. R. Vijaya was cast as Sundaram's love interest Radha, and R. Muthuraman was cast as his friend Raghavan. Singer T. M. Soundararajan made a guest appearance in the song [...] "Avalukkena", as did poet Vaali's wife Ramani Thilagam. Goundamani, who later became a successful comedian in Tamil cinema, made his acting debut with this film in an uncredited, non-speaking role.|$|E
2500|$|A strange-looking whale {{can be seen}} {{flying around}} the large statue {{during most of the}} video, {{specifically}} {{at the end of the}} video. The whale in the video was Joe Hahn's idea. He has been quoted as saying, [...] "It's not like <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> out of my ass; it made sense to me." [...] The reasoning behind its inclusion is still unknown. The whale could be identified as a [...] "space whale" [...] which takes the concept that life (or time) is too short for one to absorb all its mass surroundings. The whale also makes a brief appearance in the music video for [...] "Shadow of the Day".|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] I said. [...] "Perhaps {{we can do}} it all by ourselves. Wind {{the line}} quickly around the top of the stake as <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's mighty rough walking here," [...] {{they heard}} Tad Sobber complain. [...] "I've got a thorn right through my shoe. Wait till <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> out, will you?" [...] And {{he came to}} a halt not over ten yards from where the Rover boys were hidden.|$|R
5000|$|Interviewed {{some time}} after the incident, Fowler stated: [...] I don’t {{remember}} how many times <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> the trigger, but I think <b>I</b> just <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> once, but <b>I</b> might have <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> three times. <b>I</b> don't remember. I didn't know his name at the time, but his name was Jimmie Lee Jackson. He weren't dead. He didn't die that night. But I heard about a month later that he died.|$|R
60|$|He pointed {{with the}} pistol to a bell-handle behind me. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> in silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother {{took the}} oranges {{out of the}} knapsack, and then <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> up again. I told her that I had plenty more for myself.|$|E
60|$|I {{called to}} Euphemia {{and told her}} that I had found the old tavern sign. She came to look at it, and <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> out.|$|E
5000|$|Why don't {{you try to}} get Sir Laurence Olivier? I mean, he doesn't find it too {{difficult}} to choke to death playing Hamlet. My bag is comedy, Mr. Wachsberger, and you're asking me if I'm prepared to deliver helpless kids into a gas chamber? Ho-ho. Some laugh—how do <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> off? [...] Jerry Lewis ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Reggie," [...] he said, [...] "I'm on the trail. This time I'm {{convinced}} that <b>I</b> shall <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> off. I've remembered something of vital importance." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, MacLeod's {{two books}} of short stories, The Lost Salt Gift of Blood (1976) and As Birds Bring Forth the Sun and Other Stories (1986), were re-published {{in the volume}} Island: The Collected Stories. MacLeod {{compared}} his fiction writing to playing an accordion. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> out like this," [...] he explained, [...] "it becomes a novel, and when I compress it like this, it becomes this intense short story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{the color}} of the thing in your hand. There was more light when <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> out of the leaves yonder. Are you {{convinced}} now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I presume, madame, {{that this}} is your husband's coat,' I remarked. 'You will, I am sure, forgive me, if I am {{compelled}} to--' <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> through the window as I spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "I slept, but was anew {{awakened by}} a ghastly feeling that the blanket was being dragged and {{creeping}} off the bed. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> up again, but anew began the slow movement of descent.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall get a room somewhere," [...] said Uncle Chris, [...] "and {{start looking}} about me. I {{wonder if the}} old Holland House is still there. I fancy <b>I</b> heard they'd <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> down. Capital place. I had a steak there in the year.... But <b>I</b> expect they've <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> down. But <b>I</b> shall find somewhere to go. I'll write and tell you my address {{directly}} I've got one." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{secret to}} singing Isolde, she said, was [...] "comfortable shoes." [...] After a {{disagreement}} with the Australian soprano Joan Sutherland, Nilsson was asked if she thought Sutherland's famous bouffant hairdo was real. She answered: [...] "I don't know. <b>I</b> haven't <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a silly child I am!" [...] thought she, taking courage. [...] "It {{is really}} the most {{beautiful}} shrub that ever sprang out of the earth. <b>I</b> will <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> up by the roots, and carry it home, and plant it in my mother's garden." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Coiffured," [...] she confided, [...] "by an artist. Not an {{ordinary}} hairdresser at all. He only {{works for a}} few of our aristocracy and one or two leading ladies on the stage. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> half down and built it up again, but it's an improvement, isn't it?" ...|$|E
60|$|Nov. 7.—Now {{it began}} to be settled fair weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, {{and part of the}} 12th (for the 11th was Sunday) I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with much ado brought it to a {{tolerable}} shape, but never to please me; and even in the making <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> in pieces several times.|$|E
60|$|Nov. 7. Now {{it began}} to be settled fair weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, {{and part of the}} 12th (for the 11th was Sunday, {{according}} to my reckoning) I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with much ado, brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to please me; and, even in the making, <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> in pieces several times.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, darling. I {{must show}} you my arrangements." [...] And she rose. [...] "This," [...] she said, [...] "you see, goes under there, and that under here; and that again goes under this. Then {{they all go}} under that, and then <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> this. <b>It's</b> lovely." ...|$|R
60|$|Presently I {{recalled}} the cord {{that had been}} attached to the parcel when it fell at my side, and after a little groping my hand {{came in contact with}} it again. It depended from above, and when <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> upon <b>it</b> <b>I</b> discovered that it was rigidly fastened, possibly at the pit's mouth.|$|R
5000|$|I wouldn’t {{say it was}} {{a return}} to the old style soul of my early days, but <b>I</b> {{definitely}} <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> from the same source of raw and gritty need. The result was like a slow fever, building on the beat, pushing up the temperature with each breath of the staccato horns and pushing through to delirium as we came up on the fade.|$|R
60|$|Now {{the bottle}} came slowly through. It {{was a small}} beer-bottle, I think, and several times I was afraid {{it was going to}} stick fast and cut off {{communication}} between me and the outer world--that is to say, between me and Agnes. But at last the cork and the neck appeared, and <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> through. I did not drink any of it, but immediately applied my mouth to the tube.|$|E
60|$|Again {{he caught}} my ear. But now I {{was ready for}} him. It was useless to try to shake him off. He was too heavy and {{powerful}} for that. So I brought a small, but effective weapon into play. The weapon {{was nothing more than}} a pin that held together a rent in my trousers made the day previous. Without hesitation <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> out and ran it a good half-inch into his leg.|$|E
6000|$|... "Five {{minutes more}} and a party were {{gathered}} {{at the foot of}} the rock, and a strong rope was tied to the cloth. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> up. A rope ladder was attached to it, and the top rung was in a minute or two in my hands. To it was tied a piece of paper with the words: 'Can you fasten the ladder?' I wrote on the paper: 'No; but I can hold it for a light weight.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the best}} thing you can do," [...] Captain Holland said, [...] "though it is so dark that you would not be able to see, if you did. When you get to the bottom, untie the rope, <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> gently down, and call out to me whether the lowest piece of stick touches the ground. If it does not, <b>I</b> will <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> up again and fasten on some more. I have got a dozen spare ones with me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Term [...] "Chatty Cathy" [...] {{can be used}} {{to refer}} to a {{particularly}} talkative person. In the 1987 John Hughes movie Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Steve Martin scolds John Candy: [...] "It's like going on a date with a Chatty Cathy doll. I expect you have a little string on your chest, you know, that <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> out and have to snap back. Except <b>I</b> wouldn't <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> out and snap it back - you would. Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh!" [...] The How I Met Your Mother episode titled [...] "Spoiler Alert" [...] shows the main character Ted dating a very talkative woman named Cathy.|$|R
60|$|I {{reflected}} a moment. 'Lend me your pencil,' <b>I</b> said. He <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> out--his arms were almost unhurt, fortunately. I scribbled {{a line to}} Elsie. 'Tie my plaid to the rope and let it down.' Then I waved to her to pull up again.|$|R
60|$|She {{put both}} arms round his neck; {{and gave him}} a shower of kisses all in one. I indignantly withdrew. The door had been imperfectly closed when I had entered the room: it was ajar. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> open--and found myself face to face with Nugent Dubourg, {{standing}} by the table, with his letter from Liverpool in his hand! He must have certainly heard Lucilla cast my own words back in my teeth--if he had heard no more.|$|E
60|$|Nov. 7. Now {{it began}} to be settled fair weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, {{and part of the}} 12th (for the 11th was Sunday), I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with much ado brought it to a {{tolerable}} shape, but never to please me; and even in the making <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> in pieces several times. Note, I soon neglected my keeping Sundays, for omitting my mark for them on my post, I forgot which was which.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was now {{absolutely}} {{impossible for}} either of them safely to leap from the car unless <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> down, and my mind was not capable of even considering such an alternative. To meet him here upon the ground, in this awful solitude! To die together, but not in each other's arms; to perish from this bright earth; {{to reach out to}} my Irene; to call to her as she reached out and called to me, when the terrible monster-- It was too much! ...|$|E
60|$|I swung this hook {{cautiously}} to {{the roof}} several times before it finally found lodgment; gently <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> on <b>it</b> to strengthen its hold, but whether it would bear the weight of my body I did not know. It might be barely caught upon the very outer verge of the roof, so that as my body swung {{out at the end}} of the strap it would slip off and launch me to the pavement a thousand feet below.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I can't {{say exactly}} where it will be," [...] he answered, [...] "but if you will {{go down to the}} shore of the lake and blow four times on the dinner-horn I'll come to you, cave and all. <b>I</b> can easily <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> over the water." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2004 while Miller {{prepared}} to host his CNBC program {{he told the}} Associate Press that his show {{was not going to}} do any jokes about George W. Bush, he explained [...] "I like him. I'm going to give him a pass. I take care of my friends." [...] Miller would explain this further in a 2008 interview, [...] "I thought it was so integral that he got re-elected that I laid off him for awhile. There's {{something to be said for}} standing up in front of a roomful of press and saying I'm not going to do Bush jokes. At least it was honest, and I could see they were gobsmacked. There's jokes I get presented with everyday that I'll take out because they're ripping on people I know. Guess what, if they're my friend, <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> out. I'm not interested in hurting people, and it's not just because of 9/11." ...|$|R
