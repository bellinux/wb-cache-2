60|$|The indescribable {{sensation}} {{with which}} this simple <b>information</b> <b>filled</b> Brant startled {{him more than}} the news itself. Hope, joy, fear, distrust, and despair, alternately distracted him. He recalled Miss Faulkner's almost agonizing glance of appeal {{to him in the}} drawing-room at Susy's, and it seemed to be equally consistent with the truth of what he had just heard--or some monstrous treachery and deceit of which she might be capable. Even now she might be a secret emissary of some spy within the President's family; she might have been in correspondence with some traitor in the Boompointer clique, and her imploring glance only the result of a fear of exposure. Or, again, she might have truly recanted after her escapade at Gray Oaks, and feared only his recollection of her as go-between of spies. And yet both of these presumptions were inconsistent with her conduct in the conservatory. It seemed impossible that this impulsive woman, capable of doing what he had himself known her to do, and equally sensitive to the shame or joy of such impulses, should be the same conventional woman of society who had so coldly recognized and parted from him.|$|E

But {{at the same time}} the unique characteristics of smart spaces offers us more opportunities to filter these re-sources. To help users find the resource that they want and need we have de-signed a multi-aspect recommendation system that takes into account not only the features of the resource and the user, but also context data like the location and current activity. The developed system is flexible enough to be applied to different resource types and scenarios.

The catches occurred from June to December, in an area delimited by 06 º 22 '- 07 º 52 'S and 33 º 26 '- 34 º 58 'W. A total of 641 sperm whales were killed in this period. The average sex ratio was 2. 05 females to each male. The mean largest frequency of females was recorded {{in the first and}} the last months of the season, and that of males in July/August. The mean total length (TL) of males was 11. 4 m (minimum 7. 2 m, maximum 17. 6 m). The females had a mean TL of 10. 1 m (minimum 8. 6 m, maximum 12. 9 m). A decrease was observed in the TL of females along the years. Fetuses were observed in 8. 3 % of the catches. They had TL between 0. 24 and 4. 3 m. All sperm whales had food in their stomachs, showing that they feed in the area. As in other places north to the 40 ºS, there was a higher frequency of females than males. The difference between the time of maximum catch of males and females may reflect a temporal segregation in the arrival of sperm whales in the area.

Nevertheless, there still exist many problems, such as the serious data sparsity problem and the cold start problem. In order to solve the two problems, many researchers have put forward several solutions. These studies can be divided into two categories. The first category is filling the user-item matrix by default or by prediction [3]. Filling the user-item matrix by default is inefficient and erases users’ personalized <b>information.</b> <b>Filling</b> the user-item matrix by prediction is to predict scores according to the nearest neighbors of users or items. It is usually a one-time effort without considering the effects of users and user prediction order on recommendation accuracy, resulting in predication deviation on its nearest neighbors.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} disparities in the {{equilibrium}} of regional labor markets {{is crucial in}} a developing country as Brazil, where personal and regional inequalities are extremely pronounced, even with the recent efforts to alleviate them. Following the recent literature on the determinants of productivity differentials in a regional context, this paper aims to discuss how agglomerations economies {{are present in the}} equilibrium outcomes of the Brazilian formal labor market. There has been a wide discussion on how to correctly identify agglomeration economies given all the different types of endogeneity found in the labor market relationships, as well as taking into account all the relevant aspects that may affect the results. We make use of an employer-employee panel database from the Ministry of Labor (RAIS - Annual Report on Social <b>Information,</b> <b>filled</b> by all registered firms in Brazil) with information for six year (2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2009 and 2012). The first part of the paper presents a discussion how higher wages can be found in denser areas, where the economic activity is more concentrated. Then, a literature review of agglomeration economies provides the main line of analysis to be pursued With the panel data setting, it is not only possible to account for individual unobserved characteristics constant in time, but also for sectorial and municipal fixed effects. Moreover, identifying skills according to the occupational position of the individuals in each firm, we control for the proximity to different skill levels (in the sector and municipality) to account for different levels of production knowledge externalities. Individual fixed effects control the potential endogeneity of the labor quality. In the case of labor quantity endogeneity, even if there is no consensus of how to best control for it, instruments based on long time lags are considered. The results show that there is a positive and significant effect of density over wages (Urban Economics literature), even when controlling for other relevant characteristics. Moreover, a measure of market potential, related to the New Economic Geography literature, does not capture this positive relationship with wages in the same way, changing sign in a specific setting. Finally, considering a quantile regression approach, there is an indication that agglomeration economies reinforce wage inequality, with a higher effect for {{the upper part of the}} wage distribution...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{the most}} common cancer among women in the Czech Republic is {{represented}} by malignant tumour in breast. The nationwide mammographic screening programme was officially introduced in the Czech Republic in September 2002 and {{it is based on}} regular and preventive mammographic screening to women in order to detect early any neoplastic disease even in cases when women do not have any symptoms or difficulties. The main aim of the mammographic screening is to confirm or to disprove malignancy and if the malignancy is detected then {{to make sure that it}} is in the earliest stage. The thesis focuses on the development of the mammographic screening in the Czech Republic but it also pursue the number of mammographic screenings to number of recording of carcinoma no matter whether it is about the whole number of recorded carcinoma or the number of carcinoma in terms of mammographic screening and also in number of private patience. The first aim of the thesis was to find out which doctor often sends their patients to mammographic screening whether it is a general practitioner of a gynaecologist. These data were found out from the Mammographic screening Centre in Havlíčkův Brod. The second aim was to analyse the most frequent reason of patients, who requested the screening themselves. To collect the data it was done by a questionnaire method which answered sixty women. Thirty of them answered it in a clinic Medipoint Ltd and other thirty of them in the Mammographic screening Centre Havlíčkův Brod. The questionnaire was done by women younger than 40 years old who were tested for the ultrasound screening as by women over 40 years old who were tested for the mammographic screening. The <b>information</b> <b>filled</b> in this questionnaire included the date, the region they are from, age, and the reason why they came privately for the mammographic or ultraviolet screening. The hypothesis, that the number of mammographic screening requested by private patients is increasing, was confirmed due to the collected data from the Mammographic screening Centre in Havlíčkův Brod. As a result from the research we can see that since 2002, when the mammographic screening programme began nationwide, has been an enormous progress in the mammographic screening in the Czech Republic. Nowadays more women request to be tested for the mammographic screening in spite of the rising incidence of the cancer the mortality remains stable. This proves that this mammographic screening programme has a positive effect on the prevention of this illness...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years smart {{buildings}} topic has received much attention as well as Building Information Modelling (BIM) and interoperability as independent fields. Linking these topics is an essential research target to help designers and stakeholders to run processes more efficiently. Working on a smart building {{requires the use of}} Innovation and Communication Technology (ICT) to optimize design, construction and management. In these terms, several technologies such as sensors for remote monitoring and control, building equipment, management software, etc. are available in the market. As BIM provides an enormous amount of information in its database and theoretically it is able to work with all kind of data sources using interoperability, it is essential to define standards for both data contents and format exchange. In this way, a possibility to align research activity with Horizon 2020 is the investigation of energy saving using ICT. Unfortunately, comparing the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) Industry with other sectors it is clear how in the building field advanced information technology applications have not been adopted yet. However in {{the last years}}, the adoption of new methods for the data management has been investigated by many researchers. So, basing on the above considerations, the main purpose of this thesis is investigate the use of BIM methodology relating to existing buildings concerning on three main topics: • Smart data management for architectural heritage preservation; • District data management for energy reduction; • The maintenance of highrises. For these reasons, data management acquires a very important value relating to the optimization of the building process and it is considered the most important goal for this research. Taking into account different kinds of architectural heritage, the attention is focused on the existing and historical buildings that usually have characterized by several constraints. Starting from data collection, a BIM model was developed and customized in function of its objectives, and providing information for different simulation tests. Finally, data visualization was investigated through the Virtual Reality(VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). Certainly, the creation of a 3 D parametric model implies that data is organized according to the use of individual users that are involved in the building process. This means that each 3 D model can be developed with different Levels of Detail/Development (LODs) basing on the goal of the data source. Along this thesis the importance of LODs is taken into account related to the kind of <b>information</b> <b>filled</b> in a BIM model. In fact, basing on the objectives of each project a BIM model can be developed in a different way to facilitate the querying data for the simulations tests. The three topics were compared considering each step of the building process workflow, highlighting the main differences, evaluating {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} BIM methodology. In these terms, the importance to set a BIM template before the modelling step was pointed out, because it provides the possibility to manage information in order to be collected and extracted for different purposes and by specific users. Moreover, basing on the results obtained in terms of the 3 D parametric model and in terms of process, a proper BIM maturity level was determined for each topic. Finally, the value of interoperability was arisen from these tests considering that it provided the opportunity to develop a framework for collaboration, involving all parties of the building industr...|$|E
