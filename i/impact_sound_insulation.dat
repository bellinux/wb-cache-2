The current international standards and governmental regulations stipulate maximum <b>impact</b> <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> on construction slabs of buildings to increase acoustical comfort of interiors of dwellings as mentioned by Cost Action TU 0901 : 2014 study. In Turkey, {{the most common}} slab construction is one way hollow core slab with EPS filler. However, according to the feedback given by users who live in multi storey dwellings <b>impact</b> <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> of expanded polystyrene used construction slabs of dwellings is more than acceptable values. In the literature, there is not any information about <b>impact</b> <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> performance of one way hollow core slab with EPS filler {{and the effects of}} EPS density differences on impact sound so a comparative study on <b>impact</b> <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> of the one-way hollow core slab with EPS filler was conducted. The study aimed to determine what is <b>impact</b> <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> performance of expanded polystyrene fillers in one way hollow core slab system and the effect of density difference of EPS fillers in one way hollow core systems used in dwellings. The study has also highlighted the importance of missing impact sound isolation standards and regulations in Turkey. The research was based on TS EN ISO 10140 - 3 : 2011 laboratory measurement of <b>impact</b> <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> of building elements and the data collected was analyzed according to TS EN ISO 717 - 2 : 2013. A sample one way hollow core slab system which is used in real life constructions was designed and built with 16 kg/m 3 and 10 kg/ m 3 EPS fillers. The results showed that one way hollow core slab with EPS fillers demonstrate very low <b>impact</b> <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> performance when compared with recommended values, standards and regulations accepted by many European countries.

40|$|Abstract [652] Along time, {{architecture}} {{has shown}} a constant trend for clean style and pure plastic lightness. In consequence, the acoustic performance of buildings has become poorer in respect to their <b>sound</b> <b>insulation.</b> At {{the same time that}} the building envelope became more permeable to sound, urban environment developed and noise sources in cities became more diversified. Noise break-in works against an advantage that modern man acquired: the sensation of protection and privacy provided by their homes.

This paper proposes a critical analysis of the history of housing as far as its acoustic degradation is concerned.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{unwanted}} noise in buildings has grown continuously {{over the last}} twenty years and impact noise through separating floors has been identified as a particularly important problem. One accepted method for improving <b>impact</b> <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> is to use floating floors in which the walking surfaces are isolated from the supporting structure by a resilient layer. Traditionally the resilient layers comprise mineral or glass fibre quilts but other materials such as flooring grade polystyrene are increasingly used. Recently, shallow profile floating floors comprising flexible open cell polyurethane foam resilient layers have been developed. These systems are attractive for refurbishment projects since they can simply be placed on existing floors in order to improve their <b>impact</b> <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> whilst raising the existing floor level less than systems comprising fibre quilts. Shallow profile floating floors with thin layers of flexible open cell polyurethane foam are the subject of investigation as part of this research work. This thesis reviews the previous research on polyurethane foams and evaluates the usefulness of the Standard Tests on these materials for assisting in the selection of foam for use as resilient layers under lightweight floors. Both the static and dynamic behaviour of flexible open cell polyurethane foam are investigated and recycled polyurethane foam is shown to be particularly useful for use under floating floors Its characteristic behaviour under compressive strain is described for the first time. This thesis shows that by modifying the Standard Method for the determinaf on of the dynamic stiffness of resilient layers under floating floors (BS EN 29052 - 1), the effect of the air contained in the open cell foam specimens can be included in the Standard laboratory test. The modification makes it possible to evaluate the dynamic stiffness of low airflow resistivity resilient polyurethane resilient layers using the apparatus described in BS EN 29052 - 1 for the first time. Field measurements of impact sound pressure level conducted using sections of lightweight shallow profile floating floor on a concrete supporting floor are described. The measured improvements in <b>impact</b> <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> achieved by using the sections of floating floor are compared with the improvements predicted using the results from the modified Standard laboratory tests on the foams used as resilient layers. It is shown that by compensating for the mass impedance of the Standard tapping machine hammers good correlation between predicted and measured data is achieved. A simple method for predicting the weighted standardised impact sound pressure level (L'nT,w) in the receiving room is proposed which shows excellent correlation with L'nT,w obtained from the measured data. The work shows that BS EN 29052 - 1 is more widely applicable than the Standard itself states {{and for the first time}} identifies a method of predicting the performance of lightweight shallow profile floating floors with polyurethane foam resilient layers.

Upon the floor construction's load-bearing beams, one or multiple layers of boards are normally attached. Particle boards and/or plaster boards are installed using screws and/or glue. In the case of using glue solely, there is a potential to improve the <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> if glue with elastic properties is used instead of a traditional one which will harden completely. Results from using different kinds of elastic layers between floors as well as different kinds of board glues, all tested on identical constructions, are presented in terms of airborne <b>sound</b> reduction and <b>impact</b> <b>sound</b> pressure level.

40|$|The {{analytical}} methods for computation of <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> of multi-layer cylindrical constructions are formulated in the paper. The relationship between multi-layer and one-layer constructions is specified. With {{the use of}} {{analytical methods}} described in the paper, <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> of one-layer and multi-layer constructions was computed. The results obtained showed that <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> of a one-layer construction of the same thickness was by two orders less {{in comparison with the}} <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> of multi-layer construction...|$|R
40|$|Graduation thesis {{presents}} calculated {{estimation of}} the <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> of airborne <b>sound</b> between rooms in accordance with standard SIST EN 12354 - 1 and Technical guideline TSG - 1 - 005 : 2012. We have obtained and calculated <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> data for common structural elements (wall and floor) {{that are used in}} construction (brick walls, plasterboard walls, concrete wall and floor constructions …). <b>Sound</b> <b>insulation</b> data for the element is the base for calculation of <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> between rooms, because in addition to the <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> of border element, the <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> between rooms is also influenced by other parameters (size of rooms, contacts between the elements of rooms …). The calculation only takes into account propagation of the sound trough construction and not the direct passage of sound and indirect sound transmission through the second room. It also includes brief presentation of three Slovenian and one foregion computer programs used for calculating the <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> between rooms that are in accordance with current legislation and available on the Slovenian market. The appendix chapter includes comparison of the minimum requirements from the technical guidelines according to the type of the building and purpose of the room between which we're checking the <b>sound</b> <b>insulation...</b>|$|R
