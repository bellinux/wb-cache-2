40|$|Models {{tested in}} the NASA Ames 12 -Foot Pressure Wind Tunnel over an angle of attack range from 0 deg to 90 deg are mounted on a <b>floor</b> <b>strut</b> that {{protrudes}} from a fairly large support bump. In high-angle-of-attack tests (angle of attack = 40 deg to 90 deg), for which the floor support was originally designed, {{the effects of the}} flow angularities produced by the bump are often negligible. This is not so for low-angle-of-attack tests (0 deg to 40 deg). Since there are no standard means for correcting test data for this bump effect, low-angle-of-attack testing with the bump is not recommended by the Ames wind-tunnel staff. This paper presents an exploratory study of a technique for correcting balance forces and experimental pressures for combined wall and bump effects. This is done by modeling the aircraft, wind-tunngl walls, and bump, with PAN AIR. The wall-and-bump-induced increments in the lift coefficient and pitching-moment coefficient predicted by PAN AIR are compared with increments obtained from the Ames 12 -foot tunnel with the bump and an 8 x 12 low speed wind tunnel which has no bump...|$|R
40|$|Current design {{concepts}} for transport aircraft aim at increasing the aircraft efficiency and {{performance by the}} introduction of advanced composite materials, such as carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP). These novel transport aircraft designs may show dissimilar dynamic response behaviour due to differences in failure modes and energy absorption characteristics compared with the current transport aircraft designs made of aluminium alloys. For that reason, crash concepts are being developed to utilise the high specific energy absorption of composite materials for predefined load conditions. In the context of this paper, crash concepts for future CFRP transport aircraft were developed in which most of the kinetic energy is absorbed by tension energy absorbers integrated in the cabin and cargo floor, and by crushing energy absorbers integrated in the cabin <b>floor</b> support <b>struts.</b> The developed crash concepts define mainly parallel activation of different crash devices to achieve smooth energy absorption for different crash load scenarios. Crushing of the energy absorbers integrated in the cabin <b>floor</b> support <b>struts</b> is controlled by a novel structural design in this fuselage area. So far, this research is limited to conceptual studies performed {{on the basis of a}} generic CFRP fuselage design. Numerical simulations using the explicit finite-element (FE) code Abaqus/Explicit were performed to derive qualitative and quantitative results for an assessment of the crash concepts. A hybrid FE/macro model approach was used that combines typical FE discretisation with macro models for main failure representation. Two different crash kinematics were considered which distinguish between the failure patterns of the frame structure of the lower fuselage shell. The simulation results presented in this paper in terms of energy plots, passenger accelerations, and crash sequences identify favourable crash performance for a load scenario with fully loaded cabin and an impact velocity of 9. 1 m/s (30 ft/s). Significant amount of kinetic energy could be absorbed by tension loads. Parallel activation of crash devices resulted in smooth crash kinematics with reduced trigger loads. By utilisation of the cabin <b>floor</b> support <b>strut</b> area as an energy absorption zone, sufficient energy absorption capacity could be provided even for load scenarios with increased impact energies. The results, presented in this paper, are the basis for further detailed research work on this tension crash concept...|$|R
5000|$|Upon its release, [...] "Love Never Felt So Good" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Surprised {{by the quality}} of the song, Aisha Harris from Slate magazine wrote that Timberlake's version [...] "sounds like an outtake from Off the Wall" [...] and further commented: [...] "If producers are going to put out more MJ music, let's hope it continues to sound this good." [...] Carl Willott of Idolator offered a positive outlook on the duet version, stating: [...] "... where and Jackson's voices make for an uncannily natural combination... the other great thing is that it’s not trying to be an event, it's just a breezy dance <b>floor</b> <b>strut</b> that wouldn’t feel out of place on Off the Wall or The 20/20 Experience." [...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post called the solo Jackson rendition [...] "terrific. It's airy, sweet, funky and pretty much impossible to dislike," [...] though he would go on to pan the Timberlake remix, which he commented [...] "surfaces all the grody feelings that came rushing in 2010 with Jackson's first posthumous album, Michael." [...] Gavin Edwards from Rolling Stone said, [...] "even if it isn't on a par with Jackson's best work, it sounded like it could have easily been the sixth single off Bad, which is more impressive than it sounds."Stephanie Chase from Contactmusic said that [...] "It's not groundbreaking or an exceptional example of his artistry, but it gives a good indication that Xscape could serve as a fitting tribute to Jackson and his legacy. Jon O'Brien from Yahoo! commented: [...] "the classy disco-soul of this single could easily have been lifted from Off the Wall or Thriller." ...|$|R
50|$|The Newcomb House is a {{historic}} bungalow located at 675-677 N. El Molino Ave. in Pasadena, California. The house was built in 1914 for Dr. R. H. Newcomb. The house {{is an example of}} an airplane bungalow, an uncommon style of bungalow named for its resemblance to a biplane. The broad first-floor roof is designed to resemble a wing when viewed from the small second <b>floor,</b> and the <b>strut</b> and fretwork on the porch gable {{is similar to that of}} an airplane. The American Craftsman style was also used in the house's detailed woodwork. The house is one of the later houses built in its neighborhood, an area containing many bungalow designs, and is therefore part of {{a historic}} local progression of bungalow designs.|$|R
50|$|Behind {{the cockpit}} {{the top of}} the {{fuselage}} was slightly domed. When the Styx was configured as a trainer, a forward section of this covering was removed and a second seat, dual controls and a windscreen were fitted. The main flight instruments were mounted under the wing leading edge so they could be seen from both cockpits. The pupil's downward view was through a pair of circular windows on each side. A partition separated him from the instructor and his access was by a upward-hinged door on the starboard side which gave access to the full length of the space behind the primary cockpit. Alternatively, the roof could be retained and the clear, ventilated compartment space used to carry a stretcher, supported above the <b>floor</b> on oleo <b>struts</b> and loaded via the side door.|$|R

The entrance opens into a hall that contains a half turn timber stair with landings that rises to the temple on the upper floor. To {{the south of the}} entrance is a store room and to the east is the supper room entered through a set of timber double doors. Symmetrically located each side of the supper room are French doors that open out onto the north and south verandahs. The floors are 6" [...] tongue and grooved timber boards. The walls to the supper room are horizontal beaded boards and the ceiling is the exposed heavy joists of the upper <b>floor</b> with herringbone <b>strutting.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Caravelle 10A and 10B, which {{differed}} only in {{the engines}} used and were {{commonly referred to as}} the Super Caravelle, featured the improvements of the VI.R in addition to a high degree of further design changes. The more high-profile modifications including a stretch of the fuselage by 33-inches, a highly altered wing, an aerodynamic fairing behind the fin of the tailplane, expanded cargo capacity via raised <b>floor</b> support <b>struts,</b> and higher cabin windows; other changes including the adoption of variable-displacement pumps for the hydraulic system and the use of AC-based generators in place of earlier DC counterparts along with an auxiliary power unit (APU). The redesigned wing was equipped with double-slotted Fowler flaps, additional and repositioned stall vanes, aerodynamic improvements to the wing root and adjustments to the leading edge which improved the performance of the wing during the crucial takeoff and landing phases of flight. However, despite its commercial success, the Caravelle was soon displaced from being the focus of Sud Aviation's development efforts while the majority of the company's design engineers were progressively reallocated onto an entirely new project which was intended to produce a successor to the Caravelle. The project was relatively ambitious, having the aim of producing a viable supersonic transport that possessed the same general size and range as the Caravelle. It was decided that the envisioned supersonic airliner should be naturally named after the firm's recent success, thus the Super-Caravelle name was applied to the design. Ultimately, the work on the Super-Caravell would be merged with similar work that had been undertaken by Britain's Bristol Aeroplane Company, and would result in the development of Concorde.|$|R
