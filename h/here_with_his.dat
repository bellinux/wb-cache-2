5|$|Beer, as {{he still}} named himself, studied with Antonio Salieri and the German master {{and friend of}} Goethe, Carl Friedrich Zelter. Louis Spohr {{organised}} a concert for Beer at Berlin in 1804 and continued his acquaintance with the lad later in Vienna and Rome. A portrait of Jacob commissioned by the family at this time shows him 'confidently facing the viewer, his hair romantically dishevelled… his left hand rests on the keyboard, and his right hand grasps a musical manuscript… plac its subject {{in the tradition of}} the young Mozart'. Beer's first stage work, the ballet Der Fischer und das Milchmädchen (The Fisherman and the Milkmaid) was produced in March 1810 at the Court Opera in Berlin. His formal training with the Abbé Vogler at Darmstadt between 1810 and 1812 was, however, of crucial importance, and at around this time he begins to sign himself 'Meyer Beer'. <b>Here,</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> fellow students (who included Carl Maria von Weber), he learnt not only the craft of composition but also the business of music (organising concerts and dealing with publishers). Forming a close friendship with Weber and other pupils, Meyerbeer established the Harmonischer Verein (Musical Union), whose members undertook to support each other with favourable press criticism and networking. On 12 February 1813 Beer received the first of the string of honours he was to accumulate throughout his life when he was appointed 'Court Composer' by Grand Duke Ludwig of Hesse-Darmstadt.|$|E

25|$|The eight-year-old Wolfgang Mozart stayed <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> father Leopold Mozart and {{his sister}} Nannerl in 1764–5, during a well-publicised European musical tour. The Mozarts were lodgers of Thomas Williamson, a maker of corsets or stays. During Mozart's stay, {{the address of the}} {{building}} was 15 Thrift Street. More houses were built after 1773 {{at the north end of}} the street (whose name reverted to Frith Street), resulting in the current address of 20 Frith Street. See below, §Numbering changes in Frith Street.|$|E
25|$|During the winter, Northampton {{fought a}} long and hard winter {{campaign}} with the apparent objective of seizing a harbour {{on the north side}} of the peninsula. Edward III had probably planned to land <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> main force during summer 1346. However, the English achieved very little for their efforts. Northern Brittany was Joanna of Dreux’ home region and resistance here was stiff. The only bright spot for the English was victory at the Battle of La Roche-Derrien, where the small town was captured and a garrison installed under Richard Totesham.|$|E
25|$|Here too is the Welsh MP Henry Richard, a mid-19th-century {{secretary}} of the Peace Society, instrumental in encouraging the first university in Wales at Aberystwyth along with its founder Sir Hugh Owen, whose own memorial is {{to the east of}} the Abney Park Cedar Circle. Also buried here is Betsi Cadwaladr, a Welsh nurse who worked in the Crimea with Florence Nightingale. The Peace Society is well represented at Abney Park; two of its other 19th-century secretaries, Rev. Nun Morgan Harry and Rev. John Jefferson are also buried here.

25|$|Cankerton or Cankerton Hollow {{is rarely}} {{indicated}} by name; {{it was the}} home of James Orr, farmer who died on 6 April 1859 aged 43 (born 31 May 1845). His wife Mary King Brown had died on 12 July 1845 aged just 25 (born 20 September 1820). Another John Orr farmed <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> spouse Janet Wilson. He died on 21 January 1847, aged 68, and she died on 16 October 1889, aged 79, having moved into High Chapeltoun {{to live with her}} brothers. Husband & spouse were buried at the Laigh Kirk, Stewarton. Cankerton, originally Cankerton was also found locally as a surname, but the etymology is unclear, a 'canker' usually meaning a 'blight, a fungal disease' of trees or cereals. A Cankerton Estate is listed under a survey of coal deposits.|$|E
500|$|On 19 December {{they reached}} New Zealand where Darwin thought the tattooed Māori to be savages with {{character}} of a much lower order than the Tahitians, and noted that they and their homes were [...] "filthily dirty and offensive". He saw missionaries bringing improvement in character {{as well as new}} farming practices with an exemplary [...] "English farm" [...] employing natives. Richard Matthews was left <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> elder brother Joseph Matthews who was a missionary at Kaitaia. Darwin and FitzRoy were agreed that missionaries had been unfairly misrepresented in tracts, particularly one written by the artist Augustus Earle which he had left on the ship. Darwin also noted many English residents of the most worthless character, including runaway convicts from New South Wales. By 30 December he was glad to leave New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|The Bahia Palace, set in {{extensive}} gardens, {{was built}} in the late 19th century by the Grand Vizier of Marrakesh, Si Ahmed ben Musa (Bou-Ahmed). Bou Ahmed resided <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> four wives, 24 concubines and many children. With a name meaning [...] "brilliance", it was intended to be the greatest palace of its time, designed to capture the essence of Islamic and Moroccan architectural styles. Bou-Ahmed paid special attention to the privacy of the palace in its construction and employed architectural features such as multiple doors which prevented passers-by from seeing into the interior. The palace took seven years to build, with hundreds of craftsmen from Fes working on its wood, carved stucco and zellij. The palace is set in a two-acre (8,000 m²) garden with rooms opening onto courtyards. The palace acquired {{a reputation as one of}} the finest in Morocco and was the envy of other wealthy citizens. Upon the death of Bou-Ahmed in 1900, the palace was raided by Sultan Abd al-Aziz.|$|E

2500|$|There in fact exists an Anglo-American Encyclopedia, {{which is}} a plagiarism, {{differently}} paginated, of the tenth edition of the Encyclopedia, and in which the 46th volume is TOT-UPS, ending on p.917 with Upsala, [...] and followed by Ural–Altaic in the next volume; Uqbar would fall in between. In the 11th edition of the Britannica, Borges's favorite, there is an article in between these on [...] "Ur"; which may, in some sense, therefore be Uqbar. Different articles in the 11th edition mention that Ur, as {{the name of a}} city, means simply [...] "the city", and that Ur is also the aurochs, or the evil god of the Mandaeans. Borges may be punning on the sense of [...] "primaeval" [...] <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> repeated use of Ursprache, or on the story's own definition of [...] "ur" [...] in one of Tlön's languages as [...] "a thing produced by suggestion, an object elicited by hope".|$|E

2500|$|Earlier in the 19th century, one of {{the hottest}} issues for {{political}} and social reform was the abolition of slavery, and Stoke Newington and the Quakers, separately and together, played a prominent role in this. Indeed, William Wilberforce himself planned to be buried in the village at St Mary's Church with his sister, his will being overturned on his death since parliament considered a state funeral at Westminster Abbey more fitting. Wilberforce's son-in-law, the abolitionist lawyer James Stephen, was also a frequent visitor, as his father lived at the Fleetwood Summerhouse adjacent to Abney Park. Dr Thomas Binney, the [...] "Archbishop of Non-conformity", has a portrait in the National Portrait Gallery that shows him at the Anti-Slavery Society Convention (with Josiah Conder); Binney is buried close to the Church Street entrance in Abney Park Cemetery. Christopher Newman Hall, who was influential on the side of slavery emancipation in the American Civil War, is buried <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> father. So is the Rev. James Sherman, who wrote the introduction to Harriet Beecher Stowe's hugely influential Uncle Tom's Cabin. The novel was partly based on Josiah Henson, whose escape to freedom in Britain was assisted by the philanthropist Samuel Morley, who is buried in the cemetery. The Rev. Joseph Ketley, a Congregational missionary and abolitionist in Demerara, is also interred here, as is Rev. Dr John Morison, patron of the escaped slave and influential African-American autobiographer Moses Roper.|$|E
