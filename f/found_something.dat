5|$|In December 2010, it was {{reported}} that only 20% of the game was complete. Numerous features {{were not included in the}} final product due to time and budget constraints. The developers originally planned to add a special weapon designed to be used underwater and acquired from Chris at the end of the eight episode, but the plot of the game changed during development and the team had to discard it. Additionally, the land in the distance that can be seen from the ship in the first episode was originally going to be the setting of the last episode, where Jill would have <b>found</b> <b>something</b> from her past.|$|E
5|$|While at the {{hospital}} to meet with Simone, Hoffman is met by reporter Pamela Jenkins, {{who claims to have}} <b>found</b> <b>something</b> at the meatpacking plant. He later meets with Jill Tuck at her clinic and takes control of the games, and is given five envelopes from the box left to her in John Kramer's will, each containing photos of people to be tested. After he leaves, a flashback reveals that John brought Amanda Young to Jill, who had deemed her a lost cause, as proof of his methods. A later flashback, as Jill delivers a package from the box to {{the hospital}}, shows that Jill met with John at the plant hours before his death, where he gave her the box's key and his promise that she would be protected when the games ended.|$|E

Alex visits Christopher Sim’s home and the school where he taught before the war; both are maintained as shrines to his memory. He locates and meets with Hugh Scott, in spite of Scott’s obvious reluctance. Scott will not say anything about theTenandrome mission, except {{to confirm that the}} survey ship <b>found</b> <b>something</b> and that there was a good reason to keep it secret. Alex startles Scott by guessing that the Tenadrome had found a Dellacondan warship, but Scott will say no more.|$|E

25|$|Nobb {{suggests}} {{the only way}} the rebels can withstand Griffon is by rebuilding Paznos, a massive mobile fortress. Max and Monica travel to Heim Rada to begin restoring the origin point of the Gundorada Workshop. As they go about rebuilding the village, they are again attacked by the Death Ark. They confront Gaspard and he tells them he is just like them; fighting for a parent. He explains that his changeling father died when he was a child, and he and his mother (Rikako Aikawa/Samantha Newark) were run out of town. Eventually, she died, but beforehand, she told him he must find something worth protecting. Gaspard realizes he hasn't found such a thing, and now lives only for hatred. He tells them they must defeat Griffon, and asks if he can join them. However, the magic of Griffon turns him into a dragon and forces him to fight them. They reluctantly kill him. However, a child Gaspard is then shown meeting his mother in their old house, where she tells him she is proud that he <b>found</b> <b>something</b> worth protecting.|$|E

500|$|As {{captain and}} first line centre for Team Canada, Crosby played with {{different}} line mates {{in almost every}} game as the coaching staff struggled to find players capable of keeping pace with the superstar centre at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, and again at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. Crosby's fellow countryman and Olympic teammate, Rick Nash of the New York Rangers was questioned by the media about this, at one point saying, [...] "I think he's a tough guy to keep up with. He's so fast. The way he thinks about the game seems like it's far beyond everyone else's process. It's {{the same thing in}} the last Olympics, keep shuffling around until you <b>found</b> <b>something</b> that fit.” ...|$|E
500|$|For Peel, Thunderbirds is [...] "without a {{doubt the}} peak of the Supermarionation achievement". Suggesting that the series is pitched at a [...] "more adult" [...] level than its predecessors, he adds that its sense of adventure, {{effective}} humour and [...] "gripping and convincing" [...] episodes ensured that [...] "everyone in the audience <b>found</b> <b>something</b> to love about it." [...] Simon Heffer, a fan of Thunderbirds in childhood, commented positively on the series for The Daily Telegraph in 2011: [...] "All the elements we children discerned in whatever grown-up television we had been allowed to watch were present in Thunderbirds: dramatic theme and incidental music; well-developed plots; goodies and baddies; swaggering Americans, {{at a time when the}} whole of Britain was in a cultural cringe to them; and, of course, glamorous locations... Then, of course, there was the nail-biting tension of the rescues themselves..." [...] Film critic Kim Newman describes the series as a [...] "television perennial".|$|E
500|$|By 1758, {{the fort}} was largely complete; the only ongoing work {{thereafter}} consisted of dressing {{the walls with}} stone. Still, General Montcalm {{and two of his}} military engineers surveyed the works in 1758 and <b>found</b> <b>something</b> to criticize in almost every aspect of the fort's construction; the buildings were too tall and thus easier for attackers' cannon fire to hit, the powder magazine leaked, and the masonry was of poor quality. [...] The critics apparently failed to notice the fort's significant strategic weakness: several nearby hills overlooked the fort and made it possible for besiegers to fire down on the defenders from above. [...] Lotbinière, who may have won the job of building the fort only because he was related to Governor Vaudreuil, had lost a bid to become Canada's chief engineer to Nicolas Sarrebource de Pontleroy, one of the two surveying engineers, in 1756, all of which may explain the highly negative report. Lotbinière's career suffered for years afterwards.|$|E

500|$|The {{photographs}} in the original cassette release of Buddha were photographs taken by friend of the band Cam Jones. Kerry Key, drummer for the Iconoclasts and friend of the band, also is credited with artwork in the original cassette. To produce the artwork, Hoppus and Jones spent an afternoon together taking [...] "artsy" [...] {{photographs in}} and around Raynor's backyard. The cover art {{is a picture of}} a Buddha statue, which was a present from Hoppus' stepfather that the bassist grabbed on the way to Raynor's for the photos. After developing the photos, they took them to a copy shop to run off color copies. Afterwards, they cut, pasted and rearranged them until they <b>found</b> <b>something</b> suitable. The lyric sheets were handwritten and photocopied. Hoppus and his family in Ridgecrest would spend hours folding and combining pieces of artwork to compile the Buddha cassette. When this was complete, Hoppus would load the cassettes into his car and deliver them to local record stores around town.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast on October 29, 2009, [...] "Greg Pikitis" [...] {{was seen by}} 4.96 million household viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. It was only a slight drop from the previous week, despite direct competition from game two of the 2009 World Series on Fox. [...] "Greg Pikitis" [...] drew a 2.1 rating/5 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49. The episode received generally positive reviews. Many commentators said the awkward exchanges between Ron and Wendy at the Halloween party seemed to be hinting at a possible romance between the two in future episodes. Matt Fowler of IGN said [...] "Greg Pikitis" [...] was [...] "probably the best conceived and most hilarious episode" [...] of Parks and Recreation so far. Fowler said he liked the Leslie and Andy pairing, and he was relieved the show <b>found</b> <b>something</b> [...] "meaty and meaningful" [...] {{to do with the}} character. Fowler said Ann's party was less funny, but advanced many of the supporting characters.|$|E
500|$|The group {{deliberately}} {{left out}} the grammatically correct question mark from the album title because aesthetically, [...] "it did not look right". The booklet insert contains stylized separate portraits of the Strokes, Raphael, Gentles, and Bowersock, all photographed by Lane. For the American market and the October 2001 release, the cover art of Is This It was changed to a psychedelic photograph of subatomic particle tracks in a bubble chamber. RCA product manager Dave Gottlieb commented that [...] "it was straight up a band decision", while Gentles indicated that Casablancas had wanted it to appear globally. According to the band's manager, the frontman phoned him before the Japan and Europe release and said, [...] "I <b>found</b> <b>something</b> even cooler than the ass picture." [...] At the time, the Lane photograph was already at the presses and {{was included in the}} July and August 2001 versions. The Strokes' 2003 biography mentions the fear of objections from America's conservative retail industry and right-wing lobby as reasons for the artwork's alteration.|$|E

An unpleasant scene, Mr. Vanstone, if your opinion of your housekeeper's sanity is well <b>founded.</b> <b>Something</b> far more serious, if my opinion that her intellect is unsettled happens to turn out the right one." ...|$|R
500|$|Murdock {{begins the}} season {{wearing a black}} costume (called the [...] "vigilante outfit" [...] by production), {{inspired}} by the one worn by the character in Frank Miller's The Man Without Fear, rather than the more traditional red, horned suit. This was done to highlight the formation of Matt Murdock as Daredevil, with the costume evolving over time as the character develops. Marvel Comics' Chief Creative Officer Quesada conceptualized the look based on DeKnight's specifications. On the design process, DeKnight revealed that [...] "we tried practically everything, design-wise. We experimented {{with a lot of}} different head pieces. One version was a ski mask with the eyes sewn shut. We tried everything until we <b>found</b> <b>something</b> that just felt right." [...] DeKnight and Quesada explained that the idea was for Murdock to start out with a homemade outfit that fits more in the [...] "real-world" [...] of the series, and to then evolve it into the classic Daredevil suit. Maslansky noted that they wanted the outfit to [...] "look like something that Matt Murdock could put together himself, that he could either order off the Internet or shop around town....we wound up with pretty practical choices for him. His shirts are compression shirts and his pants wound up being from an army/navy store." [...] Concerning the black mask, Maslansky noted that a balance between aesthetic and safety was required, and that it was made of layers of cotton mesh that [...] "really conform to his head" [...] but also allowed Cox to see through the mask.|$|E
2500|$|The gamma {{function}} {{has caught}} {{the interest of}} some of the most prominent mathematicians of all time. Its history, notably documented by Philip J.

In the words of Davis, [...] "each generation has <b>found</b> <b>something</b> of interest to say about the gamma function. Perhaps the next generation will also." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critic Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian {{stated that}} [...] "the savoury, serio-comic tang of the Coens' film-making style is recognisably present, as is their predilection for the weirdness of hotels and motels".
