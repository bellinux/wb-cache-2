5000|$|One of {{the early}} results from the project was the {{successful}} demonstration of a repeatable method of joining the polymer fiber to standard silica fibre. This was a major development and allowed {{for the first time}} POF Bragg gratings to be used in real applications outside of the optics lab. One of the first uses for these sensors was in monitoring the strain of tapestries shown in Figure 4,. In this case conventional electrical strain sensors and silica fiber sensors were shown to be strengthening the tapestries in areas where they were fixed. Because the polymer devices are much more flexible they do not distort the material as much and therefore give a much most accurate measurement of the strain in flexible materials. Temperature and humidity sensing using a combined silica / POF <b>fiber</b> <b>sensor</b> has been demonstrated. [...] Combined strain, temperature and bend sensing has also been shown. Using a fiber Bragg grating in an eccentric core polymer has been shown to yield a high sensitivity to bend.|$|E

To establish a novel technical platform for real-time in vivo detection and to analyze average blood pressure and other blood flow parameters, a small, accurate, flexible, and nontoxic Fabry-Perot <b>fiber</b> <b>sensor</b> was designed. The carotid sheath was implanted through intubation of the rabbit carotid artery (n = 8), and the blood pressure and other detection data were determined directly through the veins.

Pairwise comparisons among the blood pressure results obtained using the three methods indicated that real-time blood pressure information obtained through the <b>fiber</b> <b>sensor</b> technique exhibited better correlation than the data obtained with the other techniques. The highest correlation (correlation coefficient of 0. 86) was obtained between the <b>fiber</b> <b>sensor</b> and pressure sensor.
