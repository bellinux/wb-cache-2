5|$|LEMS usually {{occurs in}} people over 40 years of age, but may occur at any age. The {{diagnosis}} is usually confirmed with <b>electromyography</b> and blood tests; these also {{distinguish it from}} myasthenia gravis, a related autoimmune neuromuscular disease.|$|E
5|$|Directly {{assessing}} nerve conduction {{of electrical}} impulses can exclude other causes of acute muscle weakness, {{as well as}} distinguish {{the different types of}} Guillain–Barré syndrome. Needle <b>electromyography</b> (EMG) and nerve conduction studies may be performed. In the first two weeks, these investigations may not show any abnormality. Neurophysiology studies are not required for the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is usually made on <b>electromyography</b> (EMG), {{which is one}} of the standard tests in the investigation of otherwise unexplained muscle weakness. This involves the insertion of small needles into the nerves supplying several muscles, administering small electrical impulses through these needles, and measuring the electrical response of the muscle in question. Two EMG investigations can be characteristic in LEMS: compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) and single-fiber examination.|$|E
5|$|Hypokalemia (low blood {{potassium}} levels) commonly {{occurs during}} attacks; levels below 3.0mmol/l are typically encountered. Magnesium and phosphate levels are often {{found to be}} decreased. Creatine kinase levels are elevated in two thirds of cases, usually due to a degree of muscle injury; severe elevations suggestive of rhabdomyolysis (muscle tissue destruction) are rare. Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) may show tachycardia (a fast heart rate) due to the thyroid disease, abnormalities due to cardiac arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), and conduction changes associated with hypokalemia (U waves, QRS widening, QT prolongation, and T wave flattening). <b>Electromyography</b> shows changes similar to those encountered in myopathies (muscle diseases), with a reduced amplitude of the compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs); they resolve when treatment has commenced.|$|E
5|$|Other diagnoses {{that are}} {{typically}} considered include fractures, tumors, or systemic disease if plantar fasciitis pain fails to respond appropriately to conservative medical treatments. Bilateral heel pain or heel {{pain in the}} context of a systemic illness may indicate a need for a more in-depth diagnostic investigation. Under these circumstances, diagnostic tests such as a CBC or serological markers of inflammation, infection, or autoimmune disease such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, HLA-B27, uric acid, or Lyme disease antibodies may also be obtained. Neurological deficits may prompt an investigation with <b>electromyography</b> to evaluate for damage to the nerves or muscles.|$|E
5|$|If an {{underlying}} muscle disease is suspected, for instance {{if there is}} no obvious explanation or there have been multiple episodes, {{it may be necessary to}} perform further investigations. During an attack, low levels of carnitine in the blood and high levels of acylcarnitine in blood and urine may indicate a lipid metabolism defect, but these abnormalities revert to normal during convalescence. Other tests may be used at that stage to demonstrate these disorders. Disorders of glycolysis can be detected by various means, including the measurement of lactate after exercise; a failure of the lactate to rise may be indicative of a disorder in glycolysis, while an exaggerated response is typical of mitochondrial diseases. <b>Electromyography</b> (EMG) may show particular patterns in specific muscle diseases; for instance, McArdle's disease and phosphofructokinase deficiency show a phenomenon called cramp-like contracture. There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electromyography</b> {{may show}} pudendal nerve motor latency.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, NeuroSky added a blink and <b>electromyography</b> {{function}} to the MindSet.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 OCZ Technology {{developed}} a device {{for use in}} video games relying primarily on <b>electromyography.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{clarify the}} diagnosis, medical workup most {{commonly}} involves laboratory tests, though, in some cases, imaging, nerve conduction studies, <b>electromyography,</b> and vibrometer testing {{may also be}} used.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electromyography</b> (EMG) is used {{to records}} the {{electrical}} activity of skeletal muscles. A device called an electromyograph measures the electrical potential of muscle cells to monitor muscle movement.|$|E
25|$|Anatomically, {{myoclonus}} may {{originate from}} lesions of the cortex, subcortex or spinal cord. The presence of myoclonus above the foramen magnum effectively excludes spinal myoclonus; further localisation relies on further investigation with <b>electromyography</b> (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG).|$|E
25|$|Muscle {{strength}} testing {{can be used}} {{to determine}} the presence of a neuromuscular disease, but cannot determine its cause. Additional testing, such as <b>electromyography,</b> can provide diagnostic information, but information gained from muscle strength testing alone is not enough to diagnose most neuromuscular disorders.|$|E
25|$|Electrodiagnostic testing (also called electrophysiologic) {{includes}} nerve conduction {{studies which}} involves stimulating a peripheral motor or sensory nerve and recording the response, and needle <b>electromyography,</b> where a thin needle or pin-like electrode is {{inserted into the}} muscle tissue to look for abnormal electrical activity.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of muscular dystrophy {{is based on}} the results of muscle biopsy, increased creatine phosphokinase (CpK3), <b>electromyography,</b> and genetic testing. A physical examination and the patient's medical history will help the doctor determine the type of muscular dystrophy. Specific muscle groups are affected by different types of muscular dystrophy.|$|E
25|$|An evoked {{potential}} or evoked response is an electrical potential recorded from {{the nervous system}} of a human or other animal following presentation of a stimulus, as distinct from spontaneous potentials as detected by electroencephalography (EEG), <b>electromyography</b> (EMG), or other electrophysiologic recording method. Such potentials are useful for electrodiagnosis and monitoring.|$|E
25|$|Key {{physiological}} measurements {{indicators of}} sleep include EEG of brain waves, electrooculography (EOG) of eye movements, <b>electromyography</b> (EMG) of skeletal muscle activity. Simultaneous collection of these measurements is called polysomnography, {{and can be}} performed in a specialized sleep laboratory. Sleep researchers also use simplified electrocardiography (EKG) for cardiac activity and actigraphy for motor movements.|$|E
25|$|SPS {{was first}} {{described}} in 1956. Diagnostic criteria were {{proposed in the}} 1960s and refined two decades later. In the 1990s and 2000s the roles of antibodies in the condition became more clear. SPS patients generally have GAD antibodies, which seldom occur in the general population. In addition to blood to tests for GAD, <b>electromyography</b> tests can help confirm the condition's presence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electromyography</b> (EMG) is {{a method}} of {{detecting}} the electrical activity that occurs when muscles are activated, thus determining which muscles an animal uses for a given movement. This can be accomplished either by surface electrodes (usually in large animals) or implanted electrodes (often wires thinner than a human hair). Furthermore, the intensity of electrical activity can correlate {{to the level of}} muscle activity, with greater activity implying (though not definitively showing) greater force.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{neurophysiology}} {{is concerned}} with testing the physiology or function of the central and peripheral aspects of the nervous system. These kinds of tests {{can be divided into}} recordings of: (1) spontaneous or continuously running electrical activity, or (2) stimulus evoked responses. Subspecialties include electroencephalography, <b>electromyography,</b> evoked potential, nerve conduction study and polysomnography. Sometimes these tests are performed by techs without a medical degree, but the interpretation of these tests is done by a medical professional.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of antibodies against GAD {{is the best}} indication of the condition that can be detected by blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. Anti-GAD65 is found in about 80 percent of SPS patients. Anti-thyroid, anti-intrinsic factor, anti-nuclear, anti-RNP, and anti-gliadin are also often present in blood tests. <b>Electromyography</b> (EMG) demonstrates involuntary motor unit firing in SPS patients. EMG can confirm the diagnosis by noting spasms in distant muscles {{as a result of}} subnoxious stimulation of cutaneous or mixed nerves. Responsiveness to diazepam helps confirm that the patient is suffering from SPS, as this decreases stiffness and motor unit potential firing.|$|E
25|$|Musculoskeletal imaging: PET {{has been}} shown to be a {{feasible}} technique for studying skeletal muscles during exercises like walking. One of the main advantages of using PET is that it can also provide muscle activation data about deeper lying muscles such as the vastus intermedialis and the gluteus minimus, as compared to other muscle studying techniques like <b>electromyography,</b> which can be used only on superficial muscles (i.e., directly under the skin). A clear disadvantage, however, is that PET provides no timing information about muscle activation because it has to be measured after the exercise is completed. This is due to the time it takes for FDG to accumulate in the activated muscles.|$|E
25|$|For some people, sensations {{from the}} {{previous}} night's dreams are sometimes spontaneously experienced in falling asleep. However they are usually too slight and fleeting to allow dream recall. At least 95% of all dreams are not remembered. Certain brain chemicals necessary for converting short-term memories into long-term ones are suppressed during REM sleep. Unless a dream is particularly vivid and if one wakes during or immediately after it, {{the content of the}} dream is not remembered. Recording or reconstructing dreams may one day assist with dream recall. Using technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and <b>electromyography</b> (EMG), researchers have been able to record basic dream imagery, dream speech activity and dream motor behavior (such as walking and hand movements).|$|E
25|$|The most usual {{trigger in}} sleep bruxism that leads {{a person to}} seek medical or dental advice is being {{informed}} by sleeping partner of unpleasant grinding noises during sleep. The diagnosis of sleep bruxism is usually straightforward, and involves the exclusion of dental diseases, temporomandibular disorders, and the rhythmic jaw movements that occur with seizure disorders (e.g. epilepsy). This usually involves a dental examination, and possibly electroencephalography if a seizure disorder is suspected. Polysomnography shows increased masseter and temporalis muscular activity during sleep. Polysomnography may involve electroencephalography, <b>electromyography,</b> electrocardiography, air flow monitoring and audio–video recording. It {{may be useful to}} help exclude other sleep disorders; however, due to the expense of the use of a sleep lab, polysomnography is mostly of relevance to research rather than routine clinical diagnosis of bruxism.|$|E
25|$|There are few {{disorders}} on {{the differential}} diagnosis for carpal tunnel syndrome. Cervical radiculopathy can be mistaken for carpal tunnel syndrome since it can also cause abnormal or painful sensations in the hands and wrist. In contrast to carpal tunnel syndrome, the symptoms of cervical radiculopathy usually begins in the neck and travels down the affected arm and may be worsened by neck movement. <b>Electromyography</b> and imaging of the cervical spine can help to differentiate cervical radiculopathy from carpal tunnel syndrome if the diagnosis is unclear. Carpal tunnel syndrome is sometimes applied as a label to anyone with pain, numbness, swelling, and/or burning in the radial side of the hands and/or wrists. When pain is the primary symptom, carpal tunnel syndrome {{is unlikely to be}} the source of the symptoms. As a whole, the medical community is not currently embracing or accepting trigger point theories due to lack of scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Physicians may {{consider}} diagnosing botulism if the patient's history and physical examination suggest botulism. However, these clues {{are often not}} enough to allow a diagnosis. Other diseases such as Guillain–Barré syndrome, stroke, and myasthenia gravis can appear similar to botulism, and special tests {{may be needed to}} exclude these other conditions. These tests may include a brain scan, cerebrospinal fluid examination, nerve conduction test (<b>electromyography,</b> or EMG), and an edrophonium chloride (Tensilon) test for myasthenia gravis. A definite diagnosis can be made if botulinum toxin is identified in the food, stomach or intestinal contents, vomit or feces. The toxin is occasionally found in the blood in peracute cases. Botulinum toxin can be detected by a variety of techniques, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), electrochemiluminescent (ECL) tests and mouse inoculation or feeding trials. The toxins can be typed with neutralization tests in mice. In toxicoinfectious botulism, the organism can be cultured from tissues. On egg yolk medium, toxin-producing colonies usually display surface iridescence that extends beyond the colony.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have been}} done with <b>electromyography</b> to trace {{skeletal}} muscle activity in some hyperkinetic disorders. The electromyogram (EMG) of dystonia sometimes shows rapid rhythmic bursts, but these patterns can almost always be produced intentionally. In the myoclonus EMG, there are typically brief, and sometimes rhythmic, bursts or pauses in the recording pattern. When the bursts last for 50 milliseconds or less they are indicative of cortical myoclonus, but when they last up to 200 milliseconds, they are indicative of spinal or brainstem myoclonus. Such bursts can occur in multiple muscles simultaneously quite quickly, but high time resolution must {{be used in the}} EMG trace to clearly record them. The bursts recorded for tremor tend to be longer in duration than those of myoclonus, although some types can last for durations within the range for those of myoclonus. Future studies would have to examine the EMGs for tics, athetosis, stereotypies and chorea as there are minimal recordings done for those movements. However, it may be predicted that the EMG for chorea would include bursts varying in duration, timing, and amplitude, while that for tics and stereotypies would take on patterns of voluntary movements.|$|E
25|$|Identification of {{the exact}} causes usually begins with a {{thorough}} medical history, including detailed questioning about symptoms, bowel habits, diet, medication and other medical problems. Digital rectal examination is performed to assesses resting pressure and voluntary contraction (maximum squeeze) of the sphincter complex and puborectalis. Anal sphincter defects, rectal prolapse, and abnormal perineal descent may be detected. Anorectal physiology tests assess {{the functioning of the}} anorectal anatomy. Anorectal manometry records the pressure exerted by the anal sphincters and puborectalis during rest and during contraction. The procedure is also able to assess sensitivity of the anal canal and rectum. Anal <b>electromyography</b> tests for nerve damage, which is often associated with obstetric injury. Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency tests for damage to the pudendal motor nerves. Proctography, also known as defecography, shows how much stool the rectum can hold, how well the rectum holds it, and how well the rectum can evacuate the stool. It will also highlight defects {{in the structure of the}} rectum such as internal rectal intussusception. Dynamic pelvic MRI, also called MRI defecography is an alternative which is better for some problems but not as good for other problems. Proctosigmoidoscopy involves the insertion of an endoscope (a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera) into the anal canal, rectum and sigmoid colon. The procedure allows for visualization of the interior of the gut, and may detect signs of disease or other problems that could be a cause, such as inflammation, tumors, or scar tissue. Endoanal ultrasound, which some consider to be the gold standard for detection of anal canal lesions, evaluates the structure of the anal sphincters, and may detect occult sphincter tears that otherwise would go unseen.|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from the}} {{decreased}} calcium influx, [...] {{a disruption of}} active zone vesicle release sites also occurs, which may also be antibody-dependent, since people with LEMS have antibodies to components of these active zones (including voltage-dependent calcium channels). Together, these abnormalities lead to the decrease in muscle contractility. Repeated stimuli {{over a period of}} about 10 seconds eventually lead to sufficient delivery of calcium, and an increase in muscle contraction to normal levels, which can be demonstrated using an electrodiagnostic medicine study called needle <b>electromyography</b> by increasing amplitude of repeated compound muscle action potentials.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Electromyography</b> (especially {{electrodes}} {{used for}} surface EMG) ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Electromyography</b> (shows that {{weakness}} {{is caused by}} destruction of muscle tissue rather than by damage to nerves.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Defecography, sigmoidoscopy, [...] transrectal ultrasound, mucosal biopsy, {{anorectal}} manometry and <b>electromyography</b> {{have all been}} used to diagnose and study SRUS. Some recommend biopsy as essential for diagnosis since ulcerations {{may not always be}} present, and others state defecography as the investigation of choice to diagnose SRUS.|$|E
2500|$|Electrodiagnostic testing (<b>electromyography</b> {{and nerve}} {{conduction}} velocity) can objectively verify the median nerve dysfunction. [...] Normal nerve conduction studies, however, do not exclude {{the diagnosis of}} CTS. Clinical assessment by history taking and physical examination can support a diagnosis of CTS. If clinical suspicion of CTS is high, treatment should be initiated despite normal electrodiagnostic testing.|$|E
2500|$|Adaptation in the neuromechanical {{sense is}} the body's {{ability to change}} an action to better suit the {{situation}} or environment {{in which it is}} acting. [...] Adaptation can be a result of injury, fatigue, or practice. [...] Adaptation can be measured in a variety of ways: <b>electromyography,</b> three-dimensional reconstruction of joints, and changes in other variables pertaining to the specific adaptation being studied.|$|E
2500|$|Muscles signals {{stimulated by}} {{neurological}} impulses are collected using <b>electromyography</b> (EMG). [...] These muscle signals {{are indicative of}} neural activity. [...] In certain instances, EMG data can be indicative of neuroplasticity and learning of motor tasks. [...] The muscular system, specifically skeletal muscle, creates movement around bone joints, and {{the central nervous system}} is imperative in directing skeletal muscles in motor movements.|$|E
2500|$|SPS {{was first}} {{described}} by Moersch and Woltman in 1956. Their {{description of the}} disease was based on 14 cases that they had observed over 32 years. Using <b>electromyography,</b> they noted that motor-unit firing suggested that voluntary muscle contractions were occurring in their patients. Previously, cases of SPS had been dismissed as psychogenic problems. Moersch and Woltman initially called the condition [...] "stiff-man syndrome", but the first female patient was confirmed in 1958 and a young boy was confirmed to have it in 1960. Clinical diagnostic criteria were developed by Gordon et al. in 1967. They observed [...] "persistent tonic contraction reflected in constant firing, even at rest" [...] after providing patients with muscle relaxants and examining them with <b>electromyography.</b> In 1989, criteria for an SPS diagnosis were adopted that included episodic axial stiffness, progression of stiffness, lordosis, and triggered spasms. The name of the disease was shifted from [...] "stiff-man syndrome" [...] to the gender-neutral [...] "stiff-person syndrome" [...] in 1991.|$|E
