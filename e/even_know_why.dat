25|$|Hitchens was a vocal {{supporter}} of Republicanism in the United Kingdom, advocating {{the abolition of}} the Monarchy, and in 1990 published the book-long polemic The Monarchy: A Critique of Britain's Favourite Fetish. His 1998 documentary Princess Diana: The Mourning After accused the British media of playing an essential role in creating a national, unchallengeable, and at times hysterical cult of personality surrounding the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, whereas previously they had been extremely critical of her and the monarchy after she had separated and divorced from Charles, Prince of Wales, and {{was having an affair with}} Egyptian billionaire son Dodi Fayed. Hitchens claimed the public were behaving irrationally, and that many appeared to not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> they were mourning. He also scrutinised the level of censorship against criticism of Diana and the monarchy but was accused, in a review by The Independent, of exaggerating on this point.|$|E

Butler convinced Iommi, who in turn broke up the current line-up, dismissing vocalist Tony Martin and bassist Neil Murray. [...] "I do regret that {{in a lot of}} ways", Iommi said.

2500|$|None of {{the jurors}} doubted that Fish was insane, but ultimately, as one later explained, they felt he should be {{executed}} anyway. They {{found him to be}} sane and guilty, and the judge ordered the death sentence. Fish arrived at prison in March 1935, and was executed on January 16, 1936, in the electric chair at Sing Sing. He entered the chamber at 11:06p.m. and was pronounced dead three minutes later. He was buried in the Sing Sing Prison Cemetery. Fish is said to have helped the executioner position the electrodes on his body. His last words were reportedly, [...] "I don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> I'm here." [...] According to one witness present, it took two jolts before Fish died, creating the rumor that the apparatus was short-circuited by the needles that Fish inserted into his body. These rumors were later regarded as untrue, as Fish reportedly died in the same fashion and time frame as others in the electric chair.|$|E
2500|$|Colbert {{had planned}} to appear at the College of Charleston on October 27, {{but was unable to}} make the event due to a {{scheduling}} conflict. One beauty shop owner in Charleston turned down a request from one of the Colbert Reports staffers to use her shop as a staging ground for a Colbert campaign stop, finding the campaign unfunny and insufficiently serious. [...] "I don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> he's running in South Carolina," [...] said the Charlestonian. Bob Coble, mayor of Columbia, was more welcoming. On Sunday October 28, 2007, Coble presented Colbert a key to the city, [...] "a proclamation that Colbert is truly 'South Carolina's Favorite Son,'" [...] and a [...] "necktie with Palmetto trees." [...] Residents of the city had previously stated that although they knew Colbert would [...] "use the visit as comedic fodder," [...] they hoped the visit would bring humor and press coverage to the city. Colbert met with former Democratic governor Jim Hodges, who signed Colbert's campaign petition and offered himself as a possible vice presidential choice. Colbert declared to cheering crowds that [...] "I love South Carolina almost as much as South Carolina loves me!", and that his slogan for improving the state in the 21st century will be [...] "First to secede, first to succeed." [...] Colbert also made an appearance the same day at the University of South Carolina, where, playing to interstate rivalry, he promised to [...] "crush the state of Georgia".|$|E

5000|$|Dewey's {{campaign}} {{was met with}} a level of pessimism by Gold Democrats on whose support his campaign depended. Some even threw their support to Bryan, since they believed him to be the stronger candidate. As early as three days into his candidacy, his campaign having been damaged by the aforementioned missteps, rumors abounded regarding Dewey's impending withdrawal which proved false. Further injuries, however, were made {{when it became clear that}} the Democratic Party leaders of Vermont were hostile to Dewey and wholly committed to Bryan. Ohio similarly went for Bryan, though with the caveat there that some leaders suggested that all mention to silver in the party platform be dropped. By May 5 John Roll McLean, the brother-in-law of and effective campaign manager for Dewey, defected from the campaign and was widely considered to now be silently supporting Bryan. By May 17 Dewey recognized that there was very little chance for him to gather enough delegates among the Western and Southern states to possibly keep Bryan from attaining two-thirds of the delegates at the convention, publicly commenting that he no longer <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> <b>why</b> he had decided to run for president at all; He effectively withdrew around this time. After this there was a major boom for his nomination as vice president on the ticket alongside Bryan; however Dewey resolutely refused to be considered ...|$|R

40|$|Historically, programmers {{have been}} trained to program using “well-designed”, academically-approved {{programming}} languages with verbose syntax designed to enhance the correctness of computer programs. However, practicing programmers are increasingly turning to programming languages that eschew burdensome syntax. One unanswered question is whether software implemented using a “less-rigorous” language does, in fact, suffer higher error rates. 1 Literature Review Some Computer Scientists have noted that a quiet transition from traditional robust programming languages to light-weight informal “scripting ” languages is underway. John Osterhout 1 has observed that: Although many people are participating in the change, few realize that the change is occurring and <b>even</b> fewer <b>know</b> <b>why</b> it is happening[?][p. 23].

The Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad y Telecomunicaciones is {{a leader}} company in Costa Rica which {{provides}} electrical and communication services, it {{is in charge of}} land line, mobile phone and internet services. In the last years the institution has been committed to the country to provide a first class service, besides of competing with companies in the field of communications at the forefront of technology. Therefore, it is necessary to administrate the different goods and services. The Electromechanical Process, Operation and Maintenance area are dedicated to preventive and corrective electromechanical maintenance of the National Telecommunication System and it is extremely important to have monitoring emergency plants located in cellular phone base stations, telecommunication area is known as Base Tranceiver Sation (BTS), in order to know different variables necessary for its proper operation. When a fault is indicated or made known to the maintenance staff through phone calls, customer complaints or power cuts made by electricity companies, stealing of equipment (batteries, ground wires, among others) should start the operation emergency plants, but often they don’t start running and the battery bank is not enough to supply the BTS, pulling out the operation and depriving the customers of service. The maintenance area staff has to go to the site without <b>even</b> <b>knows</b> <b>why</b> the emergency plant did not start with normal backup to the power outage. Thus, monitoring the emergency plant is essential to have a clearer picture in an eventuality. We propose a prototype system that allows transmitting alarms, to assist the Operations and Maintenance Department to speed up the process of responding to contingencies generated by different factors already mentioned above. The system is based on the transmission of variables from emergency plants, using two Arduinos, which take care of performing communication by two important means, as it is the GSM / GPRS signal, as well as Ethernet port through (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) WiMAX, obtaining with this a redundant system of communication...|$|R
