It is practised in religious ceremonies in Hindu temples in Bali, but is now banned in many countries on grounds of cruelty.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the high}} value placed on works of art, even famous artists were of low social status among the <b>Greeks</b> <b>and</b> Romans, who {{regarded}} artists, artisans, and craftsmen alike as manual labourers.

5|$|Kermes {{is a red}} dye {{from the}} dried bodies of the females of a scale insect in the genus Kermes, {{primarily}} Kermes vermilio.

5|$|The {{behaviour}} of the Crusaders appalled the <b>Greeks</b> <b>and</b> Muslims, {{creating a}} lasting barrier between the Latin world {{and both the}} Islamic and Orthodox religions.

5|$|A Venetian fleet forced Vatatzes' {{naval forces}} to withdraw, {{but after the}} Venetians {{departed}} for home the <b>Greeks</b> <b>and</b> Bulgarians besieged Constantinople again in November 1235.

Since {{the survival of the}} Latin Empire was in jeopardy, Pope Gregory urged the crusaders to defend Constantinople instead of the Holy Land. A combined naval force from Venice, Genoa, Pisa and Geoffrey II of Achaea broke through the blockade. Asen soon abandoned his alliance with Vatatzes, who was forced to lift the siege in 1236.|$|E
40|$|This is an {{experimental}} study of syntactic and tonal correlates of focus in <b>Greek</b> <b>and</b> Russian. Three experiments were carried out the results of which indicate: First, the dominant word order is SVO in both <b>Greek</b> <b>and</b> Russian. Second, focus distinctions have inverse word order effects, according to which syntactic elements of focus elicitations are dislocated at sentence beginning and sentence end for <b>Greek</b> <b>and</b> Russian respectively. Third, focus has a local tonal range expansion and a global tonal range compression in both <b>Greek</b> <b>and</b> Russian...|$|R

5|$|All these controversies {{have led}} {{ethnic groups in}} Macedonia to use terms in {{conflicting}} ways. Despite {{the fact that these}} terms may not always be used in a pejorative way, they may be perceived as such by the ethnic group to which they are applied. Both <b>Greeks</b> <b>and</b> ethnic Macedonians generally use all terms deriving from Macedonia to describe their own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other side, or the region in general.|$|E
5|$|An {{ethnically diverse}} region, Abkhazia was {{nominally}} {{led by the}} titular Abkhaz people, who made up less than 30% of the population; other major groups included Georgians, Armenians, <b>Greeks,</b> <b>and</b> Russians. Even though they did not form the majority, the Abkhaz were heavily favoured, and the Abkhaz language was promoted, {{a result of the}} korenizatsiia policies of the era. An Abkhaz national identity was promoted through these policies, instilling a sense of Abkhaz nationalism.|$|E
5|$|At Fontainebleau, Catherine {{arranged}} entertainments {{that lasted}} for several days, including fancy-dress jousting and chivalrous events in allegorical settings.

The fighting climaxed with the tower losing its magical properties and bursting into flames. In another spectacle, singing sirens swam past the king, and Neptune floated by in a chariot drawn by seahorses.|$|E

5|$|Complicating {{the account}} of this period {{is the issue of}} the Peace of Callias, which {{allegedly}} ended hostilities between the <b>Greeks</b> <b>and</b> the Persians. The very existence of the treaty is hotly disputed, and its particulars and negotiation are ambiguous. Ernst Badian believes that a peace between Athens and Persia was first ratified in 463 BC (making the Athenian interventions in Egypt and Cyprus violations of the peace), and renegotiated {{at the conclusion of the}} campaign in Cyprus, taking force again by 449–448BC.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{now that}} the <b>Greeks</b> (<b>and</b> {{therefore}} {{the rest of the}} region) would not have peace if left alone, Rome decided to establish its first permanent foothold in the Greek world, and divided the Kingdom of Macedonia into four client republics. Yet, Macedonian agitation continued. The Fourth Macedonian War, 150 to 148 BC, was fought against a Macedonian pretender to the throne who was again destabilizing Greece by trying to re-establish the old kingdom. The Romans swiftly defeated the Macedonians at the Second battle of Pydna.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of the Alps, 154 French {{soldiers}} were {{captured by the}} Italians.

They were held at the POW camp in Fonte d'Amore in Sulmona, along with 600 <b>Greeks</b> <b>and</b> 200 Britons, treated, by all accounts, in accordance with the laws of war. Their fate is unknown after Italy's armistice with the Allies, when they presumably came under German control.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} {{languages of}} the Republic of Cyprus are <b>Greek</b> <b>and</b> Turkish. In Northern Cyprus, Turkish was made the only official language by the 1983 constitution.
