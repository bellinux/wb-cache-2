40|$|Examines {{the health}} {{literacy}} experiences among Māori and their whānau carers who use palliative care. Executive summary The New Zealand Palliative Care Strategy recognised {{the need for}} local and national policies that support {{the specific needs of}} Māori. Two kaupapa Māori research projects (ie, projects carried out within a Māori philosophical framework) were commissioned by the Ministry of Health and the Health Research Council of New Zealand Māori Health <b>Joint</b> <b>Venture</b> <b>programme.</b> While there are increasing numbers of research projects about access to palliative care for Māori and others, these are the first studies to have taken a health literacy perspective. Health literacy impacts on both providers and patients. The Institute of Medicine defines health literacy as ‘the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions’. For health professionals, health literacy is about their ability to communicate health information and build skills and knowledge. For health organisations, health literacy is about the appropriateness of the health information and services they provide for patients and their families, as well as the organisational systems and processes that support health professionals to build health literacy. The aim of the research projects documented in this report was to identify, from a health literacy perspective, issues for Māori and their whānau (extended family) in accessing palliative care services. By identifying these issues, the research was designed to contribute to better service delivery of palliative care and improved access to palliative care for Māori and their whānau. The first project was led by the University of Auckland (Kidd et al 2014) in partnership with UniServices, Workbase, and the Māori and palliative care communities. This project was carried out in the Bay of Plenty and Auckland regions. The second research project was led by the Rauawaawa Kaumātua Charitable Trust Project Team (2013) in collaboration with research team members from the Te Kotahi Research Institute (University of Waikato), Te Rūnanga o Kirikiriroa, Te Puna Oranga and the Palliative Care Unit (Waikato District Health Board), and the Waikato Clinical School (University of Auckland). This project was carried out in the Waikato region. This document combines the original research of both projects, and unless otherwise specified the analysis is derived from both studies. Generally the two projects reached similar conclusions. The preparation of this document was commissioned by the Ministry of Health and the Health Research Council...|$|R

40|$|MBA - WBSThe {{increasing}} tend towards, {{and importance}} of, inter-organisational collaborative agreements, such as <b>joint</b> <b>ventures,</b> is widely recognised. While {{the benefits of}} <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> have been extensively promoted, many such ventures continue to fail. Research into <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> {{has been described as}} either focusing on an in-depth analysis of a selected narrow issue or sweeping generalisations of a more general magnitude, with emphasis on <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> formation motives, <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> structuring and partner selection and characteristics. More recently, a growing volume of literature strongly supports the notion that <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance might be more fully understood by the examination of the behavioural characteristics of the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> team. This study aims to establish how the behaviours of an engineering <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> team influence the venture’s performance. The methodology applied in this study is qualitative, interpretive research using the case study method. The qualitative case study investigated the implementation of an international engineering <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> between Hatch Africa, Mott Macdonald and Goba engineering companies for the delivery of the Transnet mega projects programme in South Africa. The researcher utilised semi-structured interviews and documentary investigation to construct a rich database in order to provide a holistic view of how behavioural characteristics of the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> team influences <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance. Seven key behavioural groupings, consisting of commitment, trust, cooperation/coordination/interdependence/reciprocity, communication, conflict resolution, role of management/management style and learning were analysed. Four key themes emerged namely: organisational hierarchy; the effect of time; organisational set up and design; and the current market conditions. Organisational and individual learning, communication and the role of management/management style emerged as the behavioural groupings which had the greatest affect, either positively or negatively, on <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance. Commitment, cooperation and coordination also emerged as having a significant impact on <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance while trust was found to have an indirect influence on <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance. Interdependence, conflict resolution and reciprocity were found to have less of an impact on <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance. ii By considering the results of this research, managers of <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> partner firms and <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> management teams themselves can focus their attention, both at the commencement and set up stage of the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> as well as during the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> development, on the behaviours which have the biggest impact on the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance, thereby improving the probability of success in the <b>joint</b> <b>venture...</b>|$|R

Compared to <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with developed and other developing countries, <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with NICs are characterized with low total investment, low investment per worker, low machinery investment per worker, high average number of Indonesian workers and expatriates, and high percentage of output intended for export. ^ In all industries, <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with developed countries are more capital intensive than <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with LDCs. In terms of market orientation, <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with LDCs are more export oriented than <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with developed countries. ^ Labor productivity and labor income growth are the most important contributions of <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> to manufacturing industries. Significant structural change in the manufacturing sector occurred during the study period. The output and value added shares of labor-intensive industries decreased in favor of capital-intensive industries. Labor productivity, employment, and firm size also increased notably. The study shows that <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> made significant contributions to the changes. ^ In examining Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s ability to attract foreign direct investment in manufacturing <b>joint</b> <b>ventures,</b> the study finds that GNP growth and the ratios of gross domestic investment to GNP, the value of manufactured imports to GNP, the value of exports to value of imports, and the value of commerce, transportation and communication output to GDP are important determinants.
