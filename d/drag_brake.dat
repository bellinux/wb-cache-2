The guidance scheme is characterized by a spiral turn to dissipate excess potential energy (altitude) prior to a standard straight-in final approach.

50|$|The most usual {{cause of}} damage is <b>drag</b> <b>braking</b> on severe gradients. Because the brake blocks apply {{directly}} on the tire, it is heated up, relaxing the interference fit. It is not feasible to fit the tire with such a heavy interference as to eliminate this risk entirely, and the retaining ring will ensure that the tire can only rotate on the wheel center, maintaining its alignment. In rare instances the rotation could be so severe as to wear the retaining ring down till it breaks, which could result in derailment.|$|R

5000|$|While {{energy is}} always lost during a brake event, a {{secondary}} factor that influences efficiency is [...] "off-brake drag", or drag {{that occurs when}} the brake is not intentionally actuated. After a braking event, hydraulic pressure drops in the system, allowing the brake caliper pistons to retract. However, this retraction must accommodate all compliance in the system (under pressure) as well as thermal distortion of components like the brake disc or the <b>brake</b> system will <b>drag</b> until the contact with the disc, for example, knocks the pads and pistons back from the rubbing surface. During this time, there can be significant <b>brake</b> <b>drag.</b> This <b>brake</b> <b>drag</b> can lead to significant parasitic power loss, thus impacting fuel economy and overall vehicle performance.|$|R

50|$|On October 23, 1975, this {{spacecraft}} {{was separated}} from the Orbiter, and landing was made with the sun near zenith, at 0517 UT, on October 25.A system of circulating fluid was used to distribute the heat load. This system, plus precooling prior to entry, permitted operation of the spacecraft for 65 min after landing. During descent, heat dissipation and deceleration were accomplished sequentially by protective hemispheric shells, three parachutes, a disk-shaped <b>drag</b> <b>brake,</b> and a compressible, metal, doughnut-shaped, landing cushion.|$|E

25|$|One {{week before}} live action filming commenced, Visual Effects Supervisor Brian Johnson {{and his team}} began work on the visual effects {{sequences}} for the first episode at Bray Studios near Maidenhead, Berkshire on 5 November 1973. For the first six weeks, no usable footage resulted until the team discovered a <b>dragging</b> <b>brake</b> had affected film speed. Studio rehearsals commenced at Elstree Studios near Borehamwood, Hertfordshire on 12 November 1973. During filming of the first episode, {{it became apparent that}} the troubled Elstree was under the threat of imminent closure. One weekend, the company secretly relocated sets, props, costumes, etc., to the nearby Pinewood Studios at Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, resulting in a union blacklisting of the production.|$|R

5000|$|The brakes were problematic: a 1971 {{survey of}} {{passenger}} cars registered in Sweden during 1967 place the HB Viva {{at the top}} of a list of cars identified as having faulty brakes as part of an annual testing procedure. [...] Problems were concentrated on uneven <b>braking</b> and <b>dragging</b> <b>brakes,</b> generally at the rear, and affected 26% of the cars tested. [...] Second on the list, with 24% of cars triggering brake fault reports, was the similarly configured Opel Kadett estate. [...] Although it avoided the bottom spot in other individual categories, the poor score achieved by the brakes left the Viva with the highest overall rate of failure of the 34 passenger cars included in sufficient numbers to feature in the reports of the Swedish test results.|$|R
40|$|A {{thermal model}} of railway tread braking has {{previously}} been developed for use in calculations of wheel and brake block temperatures. Block(s) and wheel are coupled via a contact interface that controls the heat generation and also the heat partitioning between block and wheel. Heat transfer from the rolling wheel into the rail is accounted for. The thermal model was calibrated using results from both standard brake rig tests and tests when a “rail-wheel” {{was introduced in the}} rig. Furthermore, the model was successfully calibrated using results from field studies. In the present work, the thermal model is utilised to study temperatures and partitioning of heating power during different braking set-ups and braking loads. First, the influences from geometrical changes are studied, with parameters such as wheel design, wheel wear and block wear. Also the effect of brake block configuration is studied. Second, the influence from brake block material is considered. Third, the influences from braking parameters are studied. Gradient braking on mountain descents is simulated but also the related case of brake system malfunctioning. Stop braking is studied. Fourth, the importance of rail chill is investigated with respect to shape and size of the contact patch between wheel and rail. A general result from the present parametric study is that rail chill is important for a useful simulation of wheel temperatures and heat partitioning at <b>drag</b> <b>braking.</b> Rail chill consumes a considerable part of the total heat at <b>drag</b> <b>braking</b> and it becomes increasingly important as the tread temperature rises. For example, {{at the end of a}} brake cycle at 30 kW per wheel for 30 min with composition brake blocks using a 920 mm wheel, 21 % of the total heat enters the rail...|$|R
40|$|A new {{technique}} {{has been developed}} to enhance the use of upper atmosphere aerobraking for increased performance from orbital transfer vehicles. This technique utilizes a pressure supported <b>drag</b> <b>brake</b> and the orbital transfer vehicle main engine to modulate aerodynamic drag and also to alleviate the aerodynamic heating during a grazing pass through the atmosphere. Performance analyses of vehicles utilizing all-propulsive or aerobraking during round trip missions from low earth orbit (LEO) to geo-synchronous earth orbit (GEO) and back shows that aerobraking allows a given vehicle to deliver approximately twice as much payload to GEO and return. Aerobraking also provides {{more than twice the}} round trip payload...|$|E
30|$|Computer-aided {{engineering}} (CAE) {{is often}} used to predict the performance of automotive brake discs. Ventilated and full brake discs were compared using CAE in [4]. The cooling ribs are located between two friction plates through which air flows in the positive radial direction, dissipating heat. It was observed that up to 77 % of the heat was dissipated by the cooling ribs in a <b>drag</b> <b>brake</b> scenario [4]. On the other hand, in an emergency stop scenario, this number is smaller, as the cooling area of the rib is heated up less due to there being too little time to conduct heat towards the cooling ribs. The dissipation percentage depends on the braking regime, since it is time- and temperature-dependent.|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{investigations}} {{have led to}} the consideration of two classes of energy efficient aeroassisted orbital transfer vehicle (AOTV) concepts, with high and low L/D. The AOTV represent reentry space vehicles which are to fly hypersonically in the continuum upper reaches of the atmosphere. Problems arise in connection with convective and nonequilibrium radiative heating. As the possibilities for obtaining needed information by experimentation are limited, reliance must be placed on computational techniques to simulate testing of design concepts. A new relaxation algorithm for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations has been developed in the context of recent work with a conservative flux difference eigenvector split implicit upwind scheme CSCM (conservative supracharacteristics method). Attention is given to the CSCM implicit method, and early results for axisymmetric bluff body flow including complete forebody and base flow for a free flight range model <b>drag</b> <b>brake</b> AOTV...|$|E

40|$|Tread brakes {{are still}} a common {{frictional}} braking system used on metro and suburban trains. Here the wheels are safety-related components {{and there is a}} need to develop design specifications and guidelines to ensure that the wheels perform properly under the service conditions to which they are exposed. In the present paper, a model is proposed and developed that represents typical conditions in metro and suburban operations, in particular during sequential stop braking. The analysis also considers <b>drag</b> <b>braking,</b> mechanical loading, residual stresses and wheel–axle interference fit. Finite element modelling, with an advanced temperature-dependent material model, together with a fatigue analysis is employed to quantify the wheel’s performance.
