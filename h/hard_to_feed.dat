40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the relationship between}} composition and properties of polypropylene/triticale straw composites. Polypropylene/triticale composites were prepared by twin-screw extrusion process and injection molding. Regarding the appropriate way to feed natural fibers into the process, a pre-extrusion step is necessary because natural fibers are fluffy and <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> in this shape without compromise the consistency of fibers flow rate. A special pelletizing step of fibers was added prior to composites extrusion step. The effects of triticale content, the presence of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (PP-g-MA) as coupling agent and of CaO as reactive additive in the formulation, on composites properties are discussed. The obtained composites were characterized in terms of morphology and microstructure, rheology, thermal and mechanical properties. The morphological observations show that a good dispersion of triticale straw in polypropylene (PP) can be achieved {{and an increase in}} polymer/fiber adhesion at the addition of coupling agent can be obtained. Composite viscosity and mechanical properties were increased with triticale content up to 40 % volume. Mechanical properties were further improved in the presence of PP-g-MA and CaO. The tensile strength was continuously increased from 32. 5 MPa up to 44. 4 MPa when triticale content increases from 10 at 40 %vol. for the composites formulated with PP-g-MA and CaO. The same trend was observed concerning the flexural properties. The reactive additive (CaO) provides superior strength and modulus and upgrades the triticale from regular filler to reinforcement categories. The recycling behavior and the flammability of composites are also disclosed. The results demonstrate that triticale straw is a good reinforcement with a great potential in thermoplastic composites field if the processing procedure and formulation are appropriate.

40|$|Solar thermal {{gasification}} of {{biomass is a}} promising route to renewable fuel production. In order to design efficient solar biomass gasifiers, the kinetic rate of the char gasification step must be determined. The key advantages of solar {{thermal gasification}} are the ability to operate at temperatures significantly higher than those used in traditional gasifiers and to operate with steam instead of oxygen to produce a product stream with higher energy content. High temperature steam gasification kinetics are rarely studied in the literature, and the methods that are commonly used to measure low temperature gasification kinetics are often not applicable at high temperatures, for example due to heat and mass transfer limitations. The work presented in this thesis comprises studies designed to advance {{the state of the}} art in high temperature steam gasification by investigating char gasification kinetics, incorporating those kinetics into a CFD model, and facilitating gasification studies in aerosol flow through the development of a novel particle feeding system. A primary goal of this work was to develop a low-cost method to obtain an empirical rate expression for steam-char gasification. A modified fixed bed reactor was used to limit the effects of heat transfer, steam consumption, and hydrogen inhibition in order to ensure that the rate was measured at known conditions. After minimizing the above effects within the constraints of our laboratory system, the reaction rate was so rapid that our factory configured non-dispersive infrared analyzer could not provide high enough temporal resolution. In analyzing the data, we observed that the outlet flow meter could respond very quickly to changes in the gasification rate. After further analysis and testing, it was determined that the flow meter alone could be used to measure the rate of gasification within the fixed bed. This gas flow measurement technique was able to provide high resolution data with a very low cost and simple to use flow meter. Using the gas flow measurement technique, data were collected over a range of temperatures, steam concentrations, hydrogen concentrations and degrees of conversion. The results were used to develop an empirical rate expression based on the Random Pore Model for the dependence on conversion and a Langmuir-Hinshelwood type expression for the dependence on the reactor conditions. To demonstrate the power of an accurate kinetic rate expression, a simplified CFD model of a small fixed bed gasifier was developed using the commercially available Ansys Fluent software package. Validation experiments were performed in a laboratory scale fixed bed reactor. The model was able to accurately predict the overall reaction rate throughout time, and to lend insight into steam gasification in a fixed bed configuration. In addition to the investigation of high temperature steam char kinetics, a novel particulate feeding system was developed to aid in aerosol flow studies. Aerosol flow reactors are a valuable tool for measuring extremely fast reaction rates with very small particles, but they require the feedstock to be delivered pneumatically at a very consistent rate. The feeding system developed in this thesis is capable of feeding a variety of organic and inorganic particles with a diameter of less than 150 µm, and has successfully fed milled biomass containing a high fraction of <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed,</b> high aspect ratio particles. It has been successfully used in several studies in our lab to measure gasification kinetics with a variety of feedstocks...|$|E

40|$|Background: It is {{important}} for midwifery students to have appropriate and timely access to clinical placement to support their theory learning. This placement must be supported by midwives {{who are able to}} share their expertise and knowledge in a supportive manner. In clinical placement students are immersed in the culture of midwifery and are socialised to the profession. Students first learn by rote and master individual skills however by third year students are expected to understand that midwifery knowledge is complex and shifting, and not always well defined or even explicit. The quality of this placement influences the students’ learning and their understanding of the culture of the midwifery profession. Midwifery practice is conducted against a background of a long standing midwifery shortage. The growth in scholarship supports the emerging professional status. Midwives work in an interdependent relationship with the medical profession with competition evident at times for normal birthing. Amongst this concerns about the safety of birthing are regularly raised and societal expectations are such that midwifery care is delivered under constant public scrutiny. In a society that values technology and seeks reassurance, expertise in low risk birthing is not highly valued. Method: Ethical approval was gained from The University of Waikato, NZ. An invitation to participate was sent to all midwives who regularly work with midwifery students within a midwifery school in New Zealand. Two focus groups, with six midwives in each group, were held in a community venue using semi structured interviews. The transcripts were then thematically analysed. Results: The first theme described the midwives work with students. The midwives enjoyed the mutual learning that occurred working alongside a student. At third year students were expected to demonstrate the mix and match of midwifery care, rather than rote learning. They were encouraged to understand that every experience has a learning opportunity. The midwives described working with students who had experienced ‘putdowns’ in the past and how they worked to build the students’ confidence. They found students varied in their initiative. The ability for the student to anticipate what might occur was valued by the midwives. Third year placement was described by the midwives as the time of students “pulling it all together”. Learning to be professional seemed {{to be one of the}} biggest challenges for some students. Many had issues with professional issues such as confidentiality, personal organisation and timekeeping. Midwives stated that at times they found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> back some of the professional issues to the student. The second theme described the implications for midwives’ practice. The midwives were aware of the responsibility they had to ensure the student practiced in a safe manner. They were conscious of their own “potential [...] . to muck it up”. At times they described juggling different expectations from the woman and the student. The midwives were aware of the scrutiny that some students placed on the midwife’s practice. This did not always feel comfortable for the midwives. The midwives also described how they did not enjoy providing written feedback on the students’ performance and in particular struggled with students who were not achieving at the expected level. Discussion: The relationship between the student and the midwife is very important to support the students’ learning in a safe environment. Midwives need to allow time to understand the students learning needs, and to debrief after working together to ensure the appropriate learning has occurred. The midwives described the “mix and match” they expected students to demonstrate in their third year, rather than a series of skills. It is this complexity of midwifery knowledge that we claim as a profession, and is the hardest to learn since many aspects are not well documented or understood. However the process of critical thinking has been documented and this explains the importance of expert practitioners describing the thinking and rationale that lie behind their decision making. This dialogue is very important to support student learning. The midwives saw themselves as role models for the students and felt it was important to share their knowledge to grow the profession. However they also felt they juggled the conflicting demands on them describing the tensions between the needs of the woman and the student, and the tensions the midwives experienced as she moved between the role of teacher, supporter and assessor of the student. The notion of “hero, martyr and workaholic” pervades midwifery literature and was evident in many of the stories the midwives shared. Students were expected to show this same commitment and were criticised for not doing so...|$|E
