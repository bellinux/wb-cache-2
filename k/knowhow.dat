25|$|It {{is likely}} that Brazil has {{retained}} the technological capacity and <b>knowhow</b> to produce and deliver a nuclear weapon. Experts at the Los Alamos National Laboratory have concluded that in view of its previous nuclear activities, Brazil {{is in a position}} to produce nuclear weapons within three years. If Brazil decided to pursue a nuclear weapon, the centrifuges at the Resende enrichment plant could be reconfigured to produce highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons. Even a small enrichment plant like Resende could produce several nuclear weapons per year, but only if Brazil was willing to do so openly.|$|E
500|$|Charness {{singled out}} the film's famous title number and states, [...] "it's a very kinetic moment, for {{though there is}} no {{technically}} accomplished dance present, the feeling of swinging around in a circle with an open umbrella is a brilliantly apt choice of movement, one that will be readily identifiable by an audience which might know nothing kinesthetically of actual dance... Accompanying this movement is a breathless pullback into a high crane shot that takes {{place at the same time}} Kelly is swinging into his widest arcs with the umbrella. The effect is dizzying. Perhaps the finest single example of the application of camera <b>knowhow</b> to a dance moment in Donen-Kelly canon." [...] He also complimented Donen's direction in the [...] "Moses Supposes" [...] number, including [...] "certain camera techniques which Donen had by now formularized... the dolly shot into medium shot to signify the ending of one shot and the beginning of another." [...] Although Donen credits earlier musicals by René Clair, Lubitsch and Astaire as [...] "integrated", he also states that [...] "in the early musicals of Lubitsch and Clair, they made it clear from the beginning that their characters were going to sing operatically. Gene and I didn't go that far. In 'Moses Supposes', he and Donald sort of talk themselves into a song." [...] Donen's Royal Wedding and Give A Girl A Break continued to use special effect shots to create elaborate dance sequences, and Kelly used even more sophisticated animation in his film Invitation to Dance.|$|E
2500|$|This {{is a true}} jetpack: a {{backpack}} that provides jet-powered flight. Most of the volume is the fuel tank, with twin turbine jet engines gimbal-mounted on each side. [...] The control system {{is identical to the}} Bell Rocket Belt: tilting the handgrips vectors the thrust – left-right & forward-back – by moving the engines; twisting left hand moves two nozzle skirts for yaw; twisting the right hand counterclockwise increases throttle. Jetpack Aviation was started by Australian businessman David Mayman with the technical <b>knowhow</b> coming from Nelson Tyler, prolific inventor of helicopter-mounted camera stabilizers and one of the engineers that worked on the Bell Rocketbelt that was used in the 1984 Olympics.|$|E
2500|$|Since gender, age, racial, income, and {{educational}} {{gaps in the}} digital divide have narrowed compared to past levels, some researchers suggest that the digital divide is shifting from a gap in access and connectivity to ICTs to a Knowledge divide. A knowledge divide concerning technology presents {{the possibility that the}} gap has moved beyond access and having the resources to connect to ICTs, to interpreting and understanding information presented once connected. Generations of youth within the 8 to 18 age range called 'Generation M' have grown up alongside the exponential growth of the Internet and personal computer and because of this, in many situations, 'Generation M' has surpassed the technological <b>knowhow</b> of their parents and teachers simply because of their extended experience with technology, which usually started in early stages of life. [...] From their foundational experiences 'Generation M' has developed innovative ideas and products based on these continually improving electronic resources and tools which have helped augment the span and quality of information and knowledge transmission. Thus the digital divide in the United States is no longer just a matter of lack of access as mentioned previously but a sort of race where the generations that created computers and the Internet must now keep up with the improving skill level of 'Generation M'. The exponential development of ICT has also developed situations where there is a great disparity in ICT skill levels among people of the same generation due to the differences in internet connection speeds in addition to differing levels of access and availability which can dictate the type and overall amount of media and information people are able to consume.|$|E

He also described the six sets of skills that underlie the public and private leadership behaviors: (1) group problem-solving and planning; (2) group decision-making; (3) interpersonal ability, which has a strong overlap with emotional intelligence (4) managing group process; (5) assertiveness; (6) goal-setting.|$|E

5000|$|In many {{contracts}} {{involving the}} use of <b>knowhow</b> (and associated IP), 'technical assistance' may be encountered {{as a part of}} the contractual process, particularly in developing country contracts. The assistance comprises services which are not in the nature of IP but are needed by the licensee to accomplish its objectives. They are of a specialized nature linked to the <b>knowhow,</b> for instance, procurement of equipment, the setup of a production facility or training of licensee personnel, on-site and off-site. These costs would bear no relationship to the royalties, although they are most often provided by the licensor. ( [...] See *Licensing Guide For Developing Countries', World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), 1977, Section H).|$|E
5000|$|This {{combination}} of royalties is met with in 'technology contracts' {{where more than}} one form of intellectual property is licensed out combined, possibly, with a <b>knowhow</b> license, and in many cases, with a straight <b>knowhow</b> license alone. [...] Where the transfer of know-how is solely the province of contract, the lumpsum often works as 'insurance' against misuse of know-how by the licensee, {{since there is no}} protective statute for it (unlike with patents and trademarks), while the 'running royalty' can be insurance for the licensee in that the licensor would provide inputs so as to maximize income (thus to the benefit of both). Alternatively, the running payments may be to spread an otherwise lumpsum component.|$|E
