Turan, which is the Persian name for the areas of Central Asia beyond the Oxus up to the 7th century (where the story of the Shahnameh ends), was generally an Iranian-speaking land.|$|E

25|$|Turks, as an <b>ethno-linguistic</b> <b>group,</b> {{have been}} {{influenced}} by the Shahnameh since advent of Saljuqs. Toghrul III of Seljuqs is said to have recited the Shahnameh while swinging his mace in battle. According to Ibn Bibi, in 618/1221 the Saljuq of Rum Ala' al-Din Kay-kubad decorated the walls of Konya and Sivas with verses from the Shahnameh. The Turks themselves connected their origin not with Turkish tribal history but with the Turan of Shahnameh. Specifically in India, through the Shahnameh, they felt themselves to be the last outpost tied to the civilized world by the thread of Iranianism.|$|E
25|$|As {{the largest}} ethnic group in Afghanistan, Pashtuns {{have been the}} {{dominant}} <b>ethno-linguistic</b> <b>group</b> for over 300 years. During the Delhi Sultanate era, the 15th–16th century Lodi dynasty briefly replaced the preexisting rulers in North India until Babur completely deposed the Lodi dynasty. Other Pashtuns fought the Safavids and Mughals before obtaining an independent state in the early 18th century, which began with a successful revolution by Mirwais Hotak followed by conquests of Ahmad Shah Durrani. The Barakzai dynasty played a vital role during the Great Game from the 19th century to the 20th century as they were caught between the imperialist designs of the British and Russian empires.|$|E

25|$|The patrilineal {{definition}} {{is based on}} an important orthodox law of Pashtunwali which mainly requires that only those who have a Pashtun father are Pashtun. This law has maintained the tradition of exclusively patriarchal tribal lineage. This definition places less emphasis on what language one speaks, such as Pashto, Dari, Hindko, Urdu, Hindi or English. There are various communities who claim Pashtun origin but are largely found among other ethnic groups in the region who generally do not speak the Pashto language. These communities are often considered overlapping groups or are simply assigned to the <b>ethno-linguistic</b> <b>group</b> that corresponds to their geographic location and mother tongue. The Niazi is one of these group.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} spoken languages, the ethnic group {{composition}} also remains {{a point of}} debate, mainly regarding the largest and second-largest ethnic groups, the Persians and Azerbaijanis, {{due to the lack}} of Iranian state censuses based on ethnicity.

Mazenderanis and Gilaks) constituting 61% of the population, Kurds 10%, Lurs 6%, and Balochs 2%.

He linked the origin of the Dorians to the mythic Myrmidons of the Trojan war, and their leader Achilles.|$|E

2500|$|Depending on the {{definition}} chosen for these terms, {{a number of}} persons could alternatively be considered the inaugural holder of the office.

Its Supreme Council, led by the Supreme President, coordinated provincial and district councils.
