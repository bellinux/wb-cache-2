50|$|Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, {{sold under}} the brandname <b>Fansidar,</b> is a {{combination}} medication used to treat malaria. It contains sulfadoxine (a sulfonamide) and pyrimethamine (an antiprotozoal). For the treatment of malaria it is typically used along with other antimalarial medication such as artesunate.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{treatments}} {{may include}} drugs like <b>Fansidar,</b> mercaptopurine: More {{commonly used in}} Europe.

50|$|It is {{primarily}} active against Plasmodium falciparum, but also against Plasmodium vivax. Due {{to the emergence}} of pyrimethamine-resistant strains of P. falciparum, pyrimethamine alone is seldom used now. In combination with a long-acting sulfonamide such as sulfadiazine, it was widely used, such as in <b>Fansidar,</b> though resistance to this combination is increasing.|$|E
50|$|Sulfadoxine and {{sulfamethoxypyridazine}} {{are specific}} inhibitors of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis pathway of malaria parasites. They are structural analogs of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and compete with PABA to block its conversion to dihydrofolic acid. Sulfonamides {{act on the}} schizont stages of the erythrocytic (asexual) cycle. When administered alone sulfonamides are not efficacious in treating malaria but co-administration with the antifolate pyrimethamine, most commonly as fixed-dose sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (<b>Fansidar),</b> produces synergistic effects sufficient to cure sensitive strains of malaria.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} adverse effects involve {{a group of}} {{symptoms}} called cinchonism; almost everyone taking quinine has mild cinchonism , which can include headache, vasodilation and sweating, nausea, tinnitus, hearing impairment, vertigo or dizziness, blurred vision, and disturbance in color perception [...] More severe cinchonism includes vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, deafness, blindness, and disturbances in heart rhythms. [...] Cinchonism is much less common when quinine is given by mouth, but oral quinine is not well tolerated (quinine is exceedingly bitter and many patients will vomit after ingesting quinine tablets): Other drugs, such as <b>Fansidar</b> (sulfadoxine with pyrimethamine) or Malarone (proguanil with atovaquone), are often used when oral therapy is required. Quinine ethyl carbonate is tasteless and odourless, but is available commercially only in Japan. Blood glucose, electrolyte and cardiac monitoring are not necessary when quinine is given by mouth.|$|E
50|$|Artemisinin is a {{sesquiterpene}} lactone with an endoperoxide {{bridge and}} has been produced semisynthetically as an antimalarial drug. The efficacy of tea made from A. annua {{in the treatment of}} malaria is dubious. Research has found that artemesinin is not soluble in water and the concentrations in these infusions are considered insufficient to treat malaria. In 2004, the Ethiopian Ministry of Health changed Ethiopia's first line antimalaria drug from sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (<b>Fansidar),</b> which has an average 36% treatment failure rate, to artemether/lumefantrine (Coartem), a drug therapy containing artemesinin which is 100% effective when used correctly, despite a worldwide shortage {{at the time of the}} needed derivative from A. annua. A 2012 review said that artemisinin-based remedies are the most effective drugs for the treatment of malaria. A 2013 review suggested that although Artemisia annua may not cause hepatotoxicity, haematotoxicity, or hyperlipidemia, it should be used cautiously during pregnancy due to a potential risk of embryotoxicity at a high dose.|$|E

40|$|Background The most {{difficult}} problem in eradicating malaria is {{the resistance of}} P. falciparum to drugs. Mandailing Natal has the highest malaria incidence in North Sumatera. Objective This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of chloro- quine and <b>Fansidar</b> in treating falciparum malaria. Methods A randomized double-blind study was done from April to May 2001. Eighty-three patients with acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infection were randomized into two groups. Group I (35 patients) received chloroquine and group II (48 pa- tients) received <b>Fansidar.</b> Blood examinations were performed on the 1 st, 2 nd, 7 th, and 28 th days. Results The resistance of P. falciparum to drugs in the chloro- quine group were found in 10 patients with R II and 1 patients with R III, while in the <b>Fansidar</b> group, there were 14 patients with R II.

40|$|This study (conducted in 1996 - 99) {{examines}} {{the association of}} mutations in pfmdr 1, dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) genes of Plasmodium falciparum with in-vivo drug resistance in West Papua, Indonesia. Initially, 85 patients infected with P. falciparum were treated with chloroquine, of whom 21 were cleared of parasites, 49 had parasitaemias classified as RI, RII or RIII resistance and 1 patient had recrudescent parasitaemia. <b>Fansidar</b> (pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine) was the second-line treatment and 18 patients were cleared of parasites and 31 had continuing infections classified as RI, RII or RIII resistance and 1 patient had recrudescent parasitaemia. The pfmdr 1, dhfr and dhps genes were examined for mutations previously shown {{to be associated with}} resistance to these drugs. In this study, mutations in pfmdr 1 were associated with chloroquine resistance and mutations in both dhfr and dhps were associated with <b>Fansidar</b> resistance in vivo. Interestingly, Gly- 437 in dhps along with Arg- 59 /Asn- 108 in dhfr were associated with RI, RII and RIII resistance whereas Glu- 540 was highly associated with only RII and RIII <b>Fansidar</b> resistance. This finding supports the hypothesis that the molecular basis of RI, RII and RIII <b>Fansidar</b> resistance involves an accumulation of mutations in both dhfr and dhps. These results suggest that mutations in both dhfr and dhps genes are a good predictor of potential <b>Fansidar</b> treatment failure...|$|E
40|$|The Histologic {{studies on}} the spleen was carried out with Chloroquine, <b>Fansidar,</b> Cotecxin and Amalar to observe any {{pathologic}} effect(s) on the tissue on comparative basis.

Also animals with <b>fansidar</b> administration showed clumping of periateriolar lymphoid cells in the white pulp not shown {{in the control group}} without any drug. In the Amalar group the spleen showed sinuisoidal dilation in the red pulp with macrophages scattered around it but not in the form of activation. For cotecxin drug there was the degeneration of periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths with residue of the infiltrated cells in the arterioles.

40|$|Whether {{children}} with malarial anaemia should receive supplementation with iron or folic acid is uncertain. Therefore, {{the effects of}} supplementary treatment with iron or folic acid, given together with chloroquine or pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine (<b>Fansidar),</b> has been assessed in 600 Gambian {{children with}} uncomplicated falciparum malaria. After one month, haematological recovery was significantly better in the group treated with <b>Fansidar</b> than in the chloroquine-treated group (difference in mean haemoglobin level = 0. 54 g/dL, P = 0. 01). Children who received iron had a significantly better response than those given placebo (differences in mean haemoglobin level after one month and at dry season follow-up = 0. 70 g/dL, P = 0. 006, and 0. 81 g/dL, P = 0. 001, respectively). Iron supplementation {{was not associated with}} increased prevalence of malaria. Supplementation with folic acid did not improve the haematological response but, among children who received <b>Fansidar,</b> the treatment failure rate was significantly higher among those given folic acid than among those given placebo.

40|$|Between 1987 and 1990, {{susceptibility}} of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine and to <b>Fansidar</b> {{was measured}} in vivo in 151 volunteers using the standard 7 -day test. All volunteers lived in Arso PIR, Irian Jaya. A 25 mg/kg dose of chloroquine base was administered over a three-day period to 92 volunteers positive for P. falciparum rings (greater than 10 rings/ 200 white blood cells). Fifty volunteers (54 %) showed results consistent with resistance. Twenty-nine were classified RII, and 21 RIII. In November 1989, a single curative dose of <b>Fansidar</b> was administered to 59 volunteers divided among three groups with 18 months, four years, and life-long exposure to endemic malaria. The proportion of volunteers in each group still positive for P. falciparum on day 7 of followup was 54 %, 0 %, and 14 %, respectively. Thus, immune status profoundly effected clinically response to <b>Fansidar.</b> Standard in vitro microtests were also performed on parasites from 11 volunteers against chloroquine, amodiaquine, quinine, pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine, and and mefloquine.

40|$|The parasitological, {{clinical}} and haematological responses to chloroquine treatment were studied in children during a 28 -day follow-up {{in an area}} of Côte d'Ivoire with intermediate chloroquine resistance. The parasitological, {{clinical and}} haematological responses to <b>Fansidar</b> were also investigated in patients who returned to the health centre within 28 days with symptoms of malaria. Of 82 children aged 0 - 9 years who completed the study, only 67 % were parasite-negative on thick blood film on day 7, which decreased to 21 % by day 28. While chloroquine treatment still produced clinical remission at day 7 in 95 % of the children, 35 % had recurrent fever with concomitant parasitaemia before day 28. All fever cases subsequently treated with <b>Fansidar</b> remained parasite-negative over a period of 28 days. On day 28 the haematocrit levels were higher in those children who responded successfully to treatment with either chloroquine or <b>Fansidar</b> than in the children who were still parasite-positive but without fever (two-tailed t-test, P = 0. 02). The rate of resistance to chloroquine was most pronounced among the younger children (< 5 years), 18 % of whom showed clinical failure by day 14.

40|$|Patients with {{falciparum malaria}} were studied in Thailand, {{an area of}} known {{chloroquine}} resistance.

40|$|Malaria {{prophylaxis}} is relative, not absolute, but {{can provide}} much protection. Travellers must take prophylactics regularly while in malarious areas {{and for one}} month thereafter; despite doing so, they may still develop malaria. For areas without chloroquine-resistant malaria, chloroquine, 300 mg base weekly, or proguanil, 100 - 200 mg daily, are preferred. In areas of chloroquine sensitivity there may be places with resistance to proguanil and pyrimethamine, but these places are not delineated. The risk of breakthrough of malaria is, therefore, least with chloroquine, but problems of potential side effects and regular medication are fewer with proguanil than chloroquine. Proguanil is preferred for long-term prophylaxis. Malaria poses a greater hazard for pregnant women and infants than do prophylactics. Pyrimethamine/sulphadoxine (<b>Fansidar)</b> or pyrimethamine/diaminodiphenyl sulphone (maloprim) are the preferred drugs for areas with prevalent chloroquine-resistant plasmodium falciparum. <b>Fansidar</b> is taken {{once a week and}} Maloprim also is usually recommended to be taken once a week...|$|E

40|$|Incomplete malaria control {{efforts have}} {{resulted}} in a worldwide increase in resistance to drugs used to treat the disease. A complex array of mutations underlying antimalarial drug resistance complicates efficient monitoring of parasite populations and limits the success of malaria control efforts in regions of endemicity. To improve the surveillance of Plasmodium falciparum drug resistance, we developed a multiplex ligase detection reaction-fluorescent-microsphere-based assay (LDR-FMA) that identifies single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P. falciparum dhfr (9 alleles), dhps (10 alleles), and pfcrt (3 alleles) genes associated with resistance to <b>Fansidar</b> and chloroquine. We evaluated 1, 121 blood samples from study participants in the Wosera region of Papua New Guinea, where malaria is endemic. Results showed that 468 samples were P. falciparum negative and 453 samples were P. falciparum positive by a Plasmodium species assay and all three gene assays (concordance, 82. 2 %). For P. falciparum infections where the assay for each gene was positive, 2 samples carried resistance alleles for all three genes, 299 carried resistance alleles for dhfr and pfcrt, 131 carried resistance alleles for only one gene (dhfr [n = 40], dhps [n = 1], or pfcrt [n = 90]), and 21 carried only sensitive alleles at all three genes. Mixed-strain infections characterized 100 samples. Overall, 95. 4 % (432 / 453) of P. falciparum-infected samples carried at least one allele associated with resistance to <b>Fansidar</b> or chloroquine.

No significant variation in frequencies was observed for the microsatellite loci over the whole study period or between seasons. However, genes involved in resistance to chloroquine showed consistent, significant increases in frequencies over time (rate of annual increase, 0. 027 /year for pfcrt and 0. 018 /year for pfmdr 1).

In {{areas of}} intense malaria {{parasite}} transmission, preliminary {{studies of the}} rate of reinfection after curative therapy suggest that small sample size studies of vaccine efficacy are feasible. However, the effect of transmis-sion rate, which may vary considerably between transmission seasons, on reinfection rate has not been assessed in areas of mesoendemicity with seasonal transmission. To address this question, the Plasmodium falciparum reinfection rate after curative therapy was measured in Sotuba, a Malian village with historically low transmission rates, as estimated by the entomological inoculation rate (EIR). The reinfection rate after curative <b>Fansidar</b> (sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) treatment was 80. 7 % (88 / 109). The EIR during the 13 -week study period (seasonal transmission) varied between 1 and 4. 5 infected bites/person/month. The finding that reinfection rates were high despite low EIRs suggests that a low EIR may be sufficient to support small sample size vaccine efficacy trials in mesoendemic areas...|$|E
