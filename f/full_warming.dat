40|$|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has {{recently}} released its Third Assessment Report (TAR), in which new projections are given for global-mean warming {{in the absence}} of policies to limit climate change. The <b>full</b> <b>warming</b> range over 1990 to 2100, 1. 4 ° to 5. 8 °C, is substantially higher than the range given previously in the IPCC Second Assessment Report. Here we interpret the new warming range in probabilistic terms, accounting for uncertainties in emissions, the climate sensitivity, the carbon cycle, ocean mixing, and aerosol forcing. We show that the probabilities of warming values at both the high and low ends of the TAR range are very low. In the absence of climatemitigatio...|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} letter, Ricke and Caldeira (2014 Environ. Res. Lett. 9 124002) {{estimated}} that the timing between an emission and the maximum temperature response is a decade on average. In their analysis, they took into account uncertainties about the carbon cycle, the rate of ocean heat uptake and the climate sensitivity but did not consider one important uncertainty: {{the size of the}} emission. Using simulations with an Earth System Model we show that the time lag between a carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission pulse and the maximum warming increases for larger pulses. Our results suggest that as CO 2 accumulates in the atmosphere, the <b>full</b> <b>warming</b> effect of an emission may not be felt for several decades, if not centuries. Most of the warming, however, will emerge relatively quickly, implying that CO 2 emission cuts will not only benefit subsequent generations but also the generation implementing those cuts.

50|$|Mackintosh {{is often}} {{compared}} to Billie Holiday, but that comparison is superficial at most. What these singers {{have in common}} is the capacity to immerse themselves into a song and sing {{it as if it were}} their own story. But other than that, Mackintosh's sound is very much her own. She has a multi octave range, but uses two distinctly different voices to emote her music. Her lower voice is more bluesy in character and has a <b>full</b> <b>warm</b> sound, her high voice has a husky feel to it; it's melancholic with a little rough edge to boot. Mackintosh is instantly recognizable and her timing and phrasing are exemplary.|$|R

5|$|The fixed {{reed and}} fairly uniform {{diameter}} of the clarinet give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical stopped pipe. Recorders use a tapered internal bore to overblow at the octave when the thumb/register hole is pinched open, while the clarinet, with its cylindrical bore, overblows at the 12th. Adjusting {{the angle of the}} bore taper controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (harmonics). Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes aspects of the harmonic timbre or voice of the clarinet because this changes the speed of reed vibrations. Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of the reed vibrate as possible, making the sound <b>fuller,</b> <b>warmer,</b> and potentially louder.|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{characteristics}} of SI engine exhaust during cold start and warm up period were investigated for different ambient temperatures (- 2 to 32 °C). A Euro 1 emission compliance SI car {{was tested using}} a real world urban driving cycle to represent typical city driving patterns and simulate ECE 15 urban driving cycle. The test car was equipped with 27 thermocouples along the engine and exhaust pipes so as to measure metal and exhaust gas temperatures along the engine, exhaust and catalyst. The {{characteristics of}} thermal properties of engine, exhaust system and catalyst were studied {{as a function of}} warm up time and ambient temperature. The temperature and time of the light-off of catalyst were investigated so as to evaluate the effect of thermal properties of the catalyst on emissions. The results show that the coolant water reached the <b>full</b> <b>warm</b> up about 5 minutes in summer and 9 minutes in winter after a cold start. Lubricating oil reached the <b>full</b> <b>warm</b> up in 10 minutes in summer and 14 minutes in winter after a cold start. The light-off time of TWC was about 3 minutes in summer and 6 minutes in winter in terms of catalyst substrate temperatures. The determination of catalyst light off has been studied and discussed in terms of catalyst substrate temperatures and gas temperatures. The ambient temperature had little influence on engine out exhaust gas temperatures. The heat loss from the engine out to the catalyst was at highest level in the first 5 ~ 6 minutes and after this point the heat available at the catalyst was relatively stable. The thermal properties of the engine and exhaust system had significant influence on emissions. The results indicate that in some urban driving conditions such as short journeys in cities especially under cold weather conditions, the function of catalysts for emission reductions is very limited...|$|R

50|$|Traditional Finnish cuisine is a {{combination}} of European, Fennoscandian and Western Russian elements; table manners are European. The food is generally simple, fresh and healthy. Meat, berries, milk and ground vegetables are typical ingredients whereas spices are not common due to their historical unavailability. In years past, Finnish food often varied from region to region, most notably between the west and east. In coastal and lakeside villages, fish was a main feature of cooking, whereas in the eastern and also northern regions, vegetables and game were more common. In Finnish Lapland, reindeer was also important. The prototypical breakfast is oatmeal or other continental-style foods such as bread. Lunch is usually a <b>full</b> <b>warm</b> meal, served by a canteen at workplaces. Dinner is eaten at around 17.00 to 18.00 at home, and it is also common to have a supper later in the evening.|$|R

40|$|Global {{forecasts}} {{were made}} with the 0. 25 -degree latitude version of GEOS- 5, with the RAS scheme and with the Kain-Fritsch scheme. Examination {{was made of the}} Katrina (2005) hurricane simulation. Replacement of the RAS convective scheme with the K-F scheme results in a much more vigorous Katrina, closer to reality. Still, the result is not as vigorous as reality. In terms of wind maximum, the gap was closed by ~ 50 %. The result seems to be due to the RAS scheme drying out the boundary layer, thus hampering the grid-scale secondary circulation and attending cyclone development. The RAS case never developed a <b>full</b> <b>warm</b> core, whereas the K-F case did. Not shown here: The K-F scheme also resulted in a more vigorous storm than when GEOS- 5 is run with no convective parameterization. Also not shown: An experiment in which the RAS firing level was moved up by 3 model levels resulted in a stronger, warm-core storm, though not as strong as the K-F case. Effects on storm track were noticed, but not studied...|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, mere {{coarseness}} of structure, indiscriminate hardihood, is {{at least}} a point of some unworthiness in a plant. That it should have no choice of home, no love of native land, is ungentle; much more if such discrimination as it has, be immodest, and incline it, seemingly, to open and much-traversed places, where it may be continually seen of strangers. The tormentilla gleams in showers along the mountain turf; her delicate crosslets are separate, though constellate, as the rubied daisy.
