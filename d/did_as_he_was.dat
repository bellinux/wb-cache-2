5|$|The {{order and}} {{regularity}} that prevailed on board, {{from the moment}} the ship struck till she totally disappeared, far exceeded anything that I had thought could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be wondered at seeing that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> directed and there was not a murmur or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I never saw any embarkation conducted with so little noise or confusion.|$|E
2500|$|The Third Battle of Ypres {{caused the}} British far fewer {{casualties}} than the Battle of the Somme and the substantial {{success of the}} occupation of the ridges around Ypres, {{the first stage of}} the offensive strategy and inflicted comparable losses on the Germans, who were far less capable of replacing losses and which contributed to their defeat in 1918. When he asked the Canadian Corps commander, Arthur Currie, to capture Passchendaele Ridge during the final month of the battle, Currie flatly replied [...] "It's suicidal. I will not waste 16,000 good soldiers on such a hopeless objective" [...] and then <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> told.|$|E
60|$|The negro {{heaved a}} sigh of discomfiture, and <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bid.|$|E
60|$|After <b>doing</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> instructed, Moran had {{not much}} trouble in fitting it into place.|$|R
60|$|The doctor turned {{round in}} his chair; but <b>he</b> hesitated in <b>doing</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> desired.|$|R

60|$|The Vicomte <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> asked. Then {{he turned}} towards the door.|$|E

60|$|Dante, while <b>doing</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> desired, {{felt like}} {{one who has}} {{suddenly}} waked up from a dream, and endeavours in vain to recollect it.|$|R
60|$|The {{captain had}} no choice but to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bid, so hastily {{provisioning}} his ship he started that same evening on his return voyage.|$|R
60|$|The other <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bidden, and George {{pointed toward}} the door.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Snodgrass <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> desired; and Mr. Samuel Weller {{forthwith}} presented himself.|$|E
60|$|Davidson <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> ordered, {{and again}} the Egyptian was left alone with Halliwell.|$|E
60|$|Busby, subdued {{by several}} {{hours on the}} floor, <b>was</b> {{disposed}} to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> told, and Hanscom unbound his legs and permitted him to rise.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> {{getting so}} {{tightened}} up in situation that <b>as</b> yet <b>he</b> could only <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> told, and keep his temper <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could.|$|R
60|$|Becasigue {{was glad}} enough to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bid, {{and in a}} few minutes the old woman {{returned}} with a basket brimming over with oranges and grapes.|$|R
60|$|Jacques <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bid, and Larochejaquelin led the men {{back to the}} trenches.|$|E
60|$|The man <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> told, and Walthew, {{following}} him, asked Blanca {{to get a}} light.|$|E
60|$|So {{the young}} man <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> told, and brought the horse back to the king.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course Gnädige Frau will escort {{the little}} child {{up to the}} Prince," [...] pursued the woman; [...] "but <b>he</b> will <b>be</b> quite good, and <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> told." ...|$|R
50|$|Frank Whitwell {{does not}} {{play a vital role}} in the book, but is an {{intelligent}} boy. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> always <b>doing</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> told and plans on going into the ministry.|$|R
6000|$|Conscious of Bertha's emotion, {{he did not}} {{immediately}} <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bidden. [...] "I wish you'd talk this over with Julia," [...] he ended gently; [...] "she's a very wise little woman." ...|$|R
60|$|Rochester <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bid. Then he {{took his}} {{handkerchief}} and tried to staunch the blood.|$|E
60|$|The red-nosed man <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> desired, and {{instantly}} commenced on the toast with fierce voracity.|$|E
60|$|The {{gardener}} <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bid, {{and soon}} placed the cradle {{in the hands}} of the intendant.|$|E
6000|$|... '"You don't mean to say," [...] says Tom, <b>doing</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{told and}} giving him back the paper, [...] "that I'm to wait here long, do you? It's a {{precious}} dismal place." ...|$|R
60|$|Jim {{would have}} obeyed almost any order at that moment. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> so dazed with fear {{as not to}} know what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about, and {{mechanically}} <b>he</b> began to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bidden.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{hard you}} are on a fellow, Cousin Milly," [...] grumbled the youngster, rising to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bid; but the {{expression}} of his jammy face showed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> no unwilling slave.|$|R

60|$|Bob thought, <b>as</b> <b>did</b> both Dick and Jim, that Harnett was foolishly particular; but, {{since the}} young {{engineer}} was so decided about the matter, {{he thought it}} best to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> requested.|$|R
6000|$|... 214. Then {{the phase}} of its spinning. The mystery of that divine spiral, from finest to firmest, which renders lace {{possible}} at Valenciennes--anchorage possible, after Trafalgar--if Hardy had but <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bid.|$|R
60|$|On the {{following}} morning the Prince asked his host {{if he could get}} him any work to <b>do,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> quite unknown in the neighbourhood, and had not enough money to take him home.|$|R
