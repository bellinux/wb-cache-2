50|$|On 6 May 1926, {{the bill}} for <b>expropriation</b> <b>without</b> <b>compensation</b> was voted on by the Reichstag. DBcause of the bourgeois majority, it was passed. If the bill had been adopted without amendment, a {{referendum}} would have been avoided.|$|E
50|$|The {{petition}} {{was initiated}} by the German Communist Party (KPD), who were then joined, with some reluctance, by the Social Democrats (SPD). It {{was not only the}} KPD and SPD voters who supported <b>expropriation</b> <b>without</b> <b>compensation.</b> Many supporters of the Centre Party and the German Democratic Party (DDP) were also in favour. In some regions voters of conservative national parties also supported expropriation. Associations of the aristocracy, the churches of the two major denominations, large-scale farming and industrial interest groups as well as right-wing parties and associations supported the dynastic houses. Their calls for a boycott finally brought about the failure of the referendum. <b>Expropriation</b> <b>without</b> <b>compensation</b> was replaced by individual compensation agreements, which regulated the distribution of the estates among the states and the former ruling families.|$|E
50|$|The {{first time}} a law was {{declared}} unconstitutional was in 1971 when a law demanded that a foundation under the University of Copenhagen was to transfer its collection of Icelandic manuscripts and its capital to the University of Iceland without compensation. The foundation contested that this was violating the constitutional ban on <b>expropriation</b> <b>without</b> <b>compensation.</b> The supreme {{court ruled that the}} foundation was to transfer the manuscripts without compensation but not its capital.|$|E
5|$|Expelled former ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema {{launched}} the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), taking a strong anti-ANC position within its ultra-left economic platform, such as {{calling for the}} <b>expropriation</b> of land <b>without</b> <b>compensation</b> and the nationalisation of South Africa's mines and the South African Reserve Bank. EFF won 25 seats in the assembly in the 2014 elections, taking the lead over older parties including COPE, FF+, and UDM.|$|R
50|$|The {{highlight}} of Dahlen is {{the ruins of}} the former Dahlen Castle. Built by Heinrich Graf von Bünau (on land left to him by his heiress wife Augusta Helena von Döring who died in 1728) between 1744-1751, the castle was originally one of the residences of the von Bünau family and latterly of the Sahrer von Sahr-Schönberg family which lost all its possessions due to <b>expropriation</b> and banishment <b>without</b> <b>compensation</b> by the post-war communists in 1945. It was completely gutted by fire in 1973, just after it had been fully restored. The insurance compensation was misappropriated by the then regime to build a new catering school in Brandenburg.|$|R
50|$|After World War I the {{multi-ethnic}} state Austria-Hungary {{was split}} up. By the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye Pausram {{became part of}} the new Czechoslovakian Republic. Following the Munich Agreement German troops marched into the town in October 1938. From that time onward the town belonged to the Gau Niederdonau until 1945. During the war 68 inhabitants fell or remained missing. On April 16, 1945, Soviet troops invaded Pausram; four days later on April 20, 1945 Czech squatters were brought into town. The remaining German men were detained and the women and children were taken inland for compulsory labour. In this time there were four civilian victims. After the end of World War II the town fell back to Czechoslovakia. As a result of the Beneš decrees the <b>expropriation</b> <b>without</b> any <b>compensation</b> and the expulsion of the remaining people to Germany was carried out. The town was recolonized because there were only 28 inhabitants left. In 1996 the expelled persons of Pausram repaired the damaged roof of the church and renovated the chapel of St. Rosalia and the War Memorial.|$|R
5000|$|The {{deportation}} of Japanese Peruvians to the United States {{also involved}} <b>expropriation</b> <b>without</b> <b>compensation</b> {{of their property}} and other assets in Peru. At war's end, only 79 Japanese Peruvian citizens returned to Peru, and about 400 remained in the United States as [...] "stateless" [...] refugees. The interned Peruvian nisei who became naturalized American citizens would consider their children sansei, meaning three generations from the grandparents who had left Japan for Peru.|$|E
50|$|Politicians {{and historians}} have differing {{interpretations of the}} events. While the {{official}} East German version of history stressed {{the actions of the}} Communist Party of the time, West German historians pointed to the substantial burdens that the referendum initiatives put on the cooperation between the SPD and the republican parties of the bourgeoisie. Attention is also drawn to the generational conflicts that emerged in this political dispute. The campaign for <b>expropriation</b> <b>without</b> <b>compensation</b> is also sometimes seen as a positive example of direct democracy.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{the state}} of the economy, the most debated {{domestic}} issue {{of the first half of}} 1926 was the question of compensation for the former ruling houses of Germany. In 1925, the Reichsgericht had declared the expropriation of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha from July 1919 to be unconstitutional and repealed it. In reaction, draft bills had been tabled in the Reichstag by Communists (requesting complete <b>expropriation</b> <b>without</b> <b>compensation)</b> and others (giving the Länder the right to finally settle this issue with the noble houses and barring recourse to the courts).|$|E

5|$|In his {{newspaper}} Berliner Arbeiterzeitung (Berlin Workers Newspaper), Gregor Strasser was {{highly critical of}} Goebbels' failure to attract the urban vote. However, the party as a whole did much better in rural areas, attracting as much as 18 per cent {{of the vote in}} some regions. This was partly because Hitler had publicly stated just prior to the election that Point 17 of the party programme, which mandated the <b>expropriation</b> of land <b>without</b> <b>compensation,</b> would apply only to Jewish speculators and not private landholders. After the election, the party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in the agricultural sector. In May, shortly after the election, Hitler considered appointing Goebbels as party propaganda chief. But he hesitated, as he worried that the removal of Gregor Strasser from the post would lead to a split in the party. Goebbels considered himself well suited to the position, and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and the media.|$|R

50|$|The <b>expropriation</b> <b>without</b> <b>compensation</b> had again been {{supported}} in the strongholds of the Centre Party. The {{same was true}} of large urban electoral districts. There too, the referendum had appealed to voters from the middle-class, national, conservative spectrum. Although, in some cases, there were more votes cast than in the petition for a referendum, the support from the agricultural {{parts of the country}} (especially east of the Elbe) was again below average. The participation rate was also low in Bavaria, compared to other regions, despite the overall increase compared with the petition.|$|E
5000|$|The {{housing market}} in Venezuela shrunk {{significantly}} with developers avoiding Venezuela {{due to the}} massive number of companies who have had their property expropriated by the government. [...] According to The Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal, Venezuela had the weakest property rights in the world, scoring only 5.0 {{on a scale of}} 100; <b>expropriation</b> <b>without</b> <b>compensation</b> is common. The shortage of housing is so significant that in 2007, a group of squatters occupied Centro Financiero Confinanzas, a cancelled economic center that was supposed to symbolize Venezuela's growing economy.|$|E
50|$|The Fürstenenteignung was the {{proposed}} expropriation of the dynastic {{properties of the}} former ruling houses of the German Empire {{during the period of}} the Weimar Republic. These princes had been deposed in the German Revolution of 1918-19. Dispute over {{the proposed}} expropriation began in the months of revolution and continued in the following years in the form of negotiations or litigation between individual royal houses and the states (Länder) of the German Reich. The climactic points of the conflict was a successful petition for a referendum {{in the first half of}} 1926, followed by the actual referendum for <b>expropriation</b> <b>without</b> <b>compensation,</b> which failed.|$|E
50|$|When Parliament {{abolished}} {{slavery in}} its territories in 1833, Britain advised {{other countries that}} slave ships that put into its ports would forfeit the slaves <b>without</b> <b>compensation.</b> After British abolition of slavery in its colonies, effective in 1834, its officials freed slaves from the Enterprise (1835), and the Hermosa (1840), <b>without</b> <b>compensation.</b>|$|R

50|$|Property {{rights are}} guaranteed, {{but are not}} absolute, because {{property}} has a social and environment role which implies obligations (Article 58). In case of conflict between individual property rights and a law enacted for reasons of public utility or social interest, the public or social interest prevails. There may be Expropriation for reasons of public utility or social interest, subject to judicial authorization and prior compensation. A 1999 constitutional amendment removed the possibility for <b>expropriation</b> <b>without</b> <b>compensation.</b> As a result, expropriation without prior compensation is only constitutional in case of war (Article 59). Complementing property rights, article 60 enshrines the State's duty to promote access to individual or collective property.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} votes that the KPD and SPD had {{achieved}} in the Reichstag elections in December 1924 was exceeded by almost 18 percent. Particularly striking was {{the high level of}} support in the strongholds of the Centre Party. Here, the number of supporters of the petition was much higher than the total {{number of votes}} received by the KPD and SPD.at the previous general election. Even domains of liberalism such as Württemberg exhibited similar trends.Particularly marked were the gains recorded in large cities. <b>Expropriation</b> <b>without</b> <b>compensation</b> was supported not just by supporters of the workers' parties but also by many voters in the centre and right-wing parties.|$|E
50|$|The Communist and Socialist parties {{believed}} in expropriating the former ruling houses without giving compensation. Attempts {{to make this}} happen through the Reichstag always failed due to the opposition of the other parties. The liberal DDP and DVP, the Catholic Centre Party and the nationalist DNVP all saw such attempts as extremist attacks on property rights. The DVP and the DNVP also opposed these attempts due to their monarchist leanings (although both parties had relegated a restoration to a long-term goal by this stage, effectively recognising the republic). The Communists and the Socialists hoped that the public would be more sympathetic. By 1926 over 30,000 signatures expressing support for <b>expropriation</b> <b>without</b> <b>compensation</b> were gathered. This forced a referendum on the issue, under Article 73 of the Weimar Constitution.|$|E

50|$|The Central Bank of Venezuela is {{responsible}} for developing monetary policy for the Venezuelan bolívar which is used as currency. The President of the Central Bank of Venezuela serves as the country's representative in the International Monetary Fund. The U.S.-based conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, cited in The Wall Street Journal, claims Venezuela has the weakest property rights in the world, scoring only 5.0 {{on a scale of}} 100; <b>expropriation</b> <b>without</b> <b>compensation</b> is not uncommon. Venezuela has a mixed economy dominated by the petroleum sector, which accounts for roughly a third of GDP, around 80% of exports, {{and more than half of}} government revenues. Per capita GDP for 2016 was estimated to be US$15,100, ranking 109th in the world. Venezuela has the least expensive petrol in the world because the consumer price of petrol is heavily subsidized.|$|E
50|$|Two days later, on 25 November 1925, the Communist Party also {{initiated}} a bill. This {{did not provide}} for any balancing of interests between {{the states and the}} royal houses, but instead specified <b>expropriation</b> <b>without</b> <b>compensation.</b> The land was to be handed over to farmers and tenants; palaces were to be converted into convalescent homes or used to alleviate the housing shortage; and the cash was to go to disabled war veterans and surviving dependants of those who had fallen in the War. The bill was addressed less to the parliament, where it was unlikely to gain a majority, as to the populace. The petition for a referendum was meant to allow the people to express its will for a radical change in the ownership of property, first of all with respect to the seized property of the ruling houses.|$|E

It has backed calls to improve state housing for all poor people in South Africa and wants to lower and even scrap the rents being paid to government by poor communities on the Cape Flats. Its other policies cover a wide range of issues, from improving education to prison reform, the provision of better state healthcare, wide-scale industrialisation and dealing with the country's high unemployment levels.|$|E

At the same time, the houses of Germans were confiscated <b>without</b> <b>compensation.</b> The land and farmhouses were distributed to small-scale farmers, rural workers and colonists {{from other parts of}} the country.|$|R

5000|$|It was {{expected}} that on 20 June 1926 {{the number of those}} in favour of <b>expropriation</b> <b>without</b> <b>compensation,</b> would be higher. There were a number of reasons to expect that: because the vote in June would be decisive, greater mobilization of the voters on the left could be expected than in the March petition. The failure of all previous attempts at parliamentary compromise had lent support to those voices in the bourgeois parties that were also in favour of such a radical change. For example, youth organizations of the Centre Party [...] and the DDP called for a [...] "yes" [...] vote. The DDP was split into supporters and opponents. The party leadership, therefore, left it to the DDP supporters to choose which side they would vote for. In addition, those organizations that represented the interests of the victims of inflation, now recommended voting for the expropriation.|$|E
5000|$|A major {{conflict}} {{erupted in}} spring 1926 when {{a referendum on}} <b>expropriation</b> <b>without</b> <b>compensation</b> was initiated by the SPD and the Communists. Before the referendum, representatives of the coalition parties tried to forestall it by offering the SPD an alternative compromise law. This called for a special court in which these conflicts between noble houses and Länder (state) governments could be addressed. It also included the possibility of declaring a substantial share of the princes' assets as [...] "government property". However, both SPD and DNVP were unwilling to accept this compromise. Talks on the issue ceased on 28 April. A few days earlier the cabinet, on the initiative of the centre parties and the president, had expressed its view on {{the constitutionality of the}} compromise law, opining that it would require a two-thirds majority. On 30 April, the cabinet approved a draft law (closely resembling the compromise). On 14 May, the Reichsrat approved this law with a two-thirds majority. The referendum took place on 20 June. Although the vast majority of participating voters voted yes, it failed to achieve the required absolute majority of those entitled to vote.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between foreign direct investment in the mineral sector and environmental regulation in developing countries. It argues that two major trends in global mineral investment have emerged in recent years: increased competition amongst developing countries to attract mineral investment, and the development and proliferation of a standard set of legal protections for mineral investors including access to international arbitration, prohibitions of <b>expropriation</b> <b>without</b> <b>compensation,</b> and commitments to stability of the regulatory regime. Both of these trends may have implications for environmental policy, which are examined in the paper both in general terms and {{in the context of}} a detailed case study concerning mineral exploitation in Ghana's forest reserves. © Springer Science+Business Media B.
