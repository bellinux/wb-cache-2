5|$|The Natural History is {{generally}} divided into the organic {{plants and animals}} and the <b>inorganic</b> <b>matter,</b> although there are frequent digressions in each section. The encyclopedia also notes the uses made {{of all of these}} by the Romans.

5|$|How life {{originated}} from <b>inorganic</b> <b>matter</b> remains an unresolved problem in biology. One prominent {{hypothesis is that}} life {{first appeared in the}} form of short self-replicating RNA polymers. On this view, life may have come into existence when RNA chains first experienced the basic conditions, as conceived by Charles Darwin, for natural selection to operate. These conditions are: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. The fitness of an early RNA replicator would likely have been a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (i.e., determined by the nucleotide sequence) and the availability of resources. The three primary adaptive capacities could logically have been: (1) the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type), (2) the capacity to avoid decay, and (3) the capacity to acquire and process resources. These capacities would have been determined initially by the folded configurations (including those configurations with ribozyme activity) of the RNA replicators that, in turn, would have been encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences.|$|E
5|$|Soil is {{the living}} {{top layer of}} mineral and organic dirt that covers {{the surface of the}} planet. It is the chief {{organizing}} centre of most ecosystem functions, and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology. The decomposition of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing minerals and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the pedosphere where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the detritivores that regulate soil formation. Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where <b>inorganic</b> <b>matter</b> is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called bioturbation. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil microorganisms are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils. Paleoecological studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period. Other events, such as the evolution of trees and the colonization of land in the Devonian period {{played a significant role in}} the early development of ecological trophism in soils.|$|E

25|$|Jung drew {{an analogy}} between the psyche and {{light on the}} {{electromagnetic}} spectrum. The center of the visible light spectrum (i.e., yellow) corresponds to consciousness, which grades into unconsciousnessness at the red and blue ends. Red corresponds to basic unconscious urges, and the invisible infra-red {{end of the spectrum}} corresponds to the influence of biological instinct, which merges with its chemical and physical conditions. The blue end of the spectrum represents spiritual ideas; and the archetypes, exerting their influence from beyond the visible, correspond to the invisible realm of ultra-violet. Jung suggested that not only do the archetypal structures govern the behavior of all living organisms, but that they were contiguous with structures controlling the behavior of <b>inorganic</b> <b>matter</b> as well.|$|E
25|$|Prions, the {{infectious}} agent of CJD, {{may not be}} inactivated by means of routine surgical instrument sterilization procedures.

No cases of iatrogenic transmission of CJD have been reported subsequent to the adoption of current sterilization procedures, or since 1976. Copper-hydrogen peroxide has been suggested {{as an alternative to the}} current recommendation of sodium hydroxide or sodium hypochlorite. Thermal depolymerization also destroys prions in infected organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>matter,</b> since the process chemically attacks protein at the molecular level, although more effective and practical methods involve destruction by combinations of detergents and enzymes similar to biological washing powders.|$|E
500|$|Shortly afterwards, Wallace {{became a}} spiritualist. At {{about the same}} time, he began to {{maintain}} that natural selection cannot account for mathematical, artistic, or musical genius, as well as metaphysical musings, and wit and humour. He eventually said that something in [...] "the unseen universe of Spirit" [...] had interceded {{at least three times}} in history. The first was the creation of life from <b>inorganic</b> <b>matter.</b> The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals. And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in humankind. He also believed that the [...] of the universe was the development of the human spirit. These views greatly disturbed Darwin, who argued that spiritual appeals were not necessary and that sexual selection could easily explain apparently non-adaptive mental phenomena. While some historians have concluded that Wallace's belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism, other Wallace scholars have disagreed, and some maintain that Wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas. Reaction to Wallace's ideas on this topic among leading naturalists at the time varied. Charles Lyell endorsed Wallace's views on human evolution rather than Darwin's. Wallace's belief that human consciousness could not be entirely a product of purely material causes was shared by a number of prominent intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, many, including Huxley, Hooker, and Darwin himself, were critical of Wallace. As the historian of science Michael Shermer has stated, Wallace's views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of the emerging Darwinian philosophy, which were that evolution was not teleological (purpose driven) and that it was not anthropocentric (human-centred). Much later in his life Wallace returned to these themes, that evolution suggested that the universe might have a purpose and that certain aspects of living organisms might not be explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes, in a 1909 magazine article entitled The World of Life, which he later expanded into a book of the same name; a work that Shermer said anticipated some ideas about design in nature and directed evolution that would arise from various religious traditions throughout the 20th century.|$|E

30|$|Industrial {{demand for}} {{modified}} starch triggers {{the rise in}} number and expanding in scale of starch factories. The modified starch processes generate wastewater containing organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>matters</b> that affect wastewater treatment, especially in chemical modification such as oxidation. A large amount of NaCl was produced during the oxidized modified starch production processes in the wastewater (Chavalparit and Limpaseni 1995). This {{is because of the}} addition of chemical substances to the process and the adjustment of pH with HCl. The presence of high salt concentration has been traditionally considered as inhibitory for biological wastewater treatment (Fusuwankaya et al. 2009; Kokabian et al. 2013) and caused paralysis of the original wastewater treatment system.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Distribution of {{hazardous}} substances and their release potential were investigated in industrial construction and demolition waste (ICDW) of several chemical and metallurgical factories.

In this study, wash-off coupled with ultrasonic process, immobilization and natural degradation experiments were performed on the simulated ICDW on basis of different pollutants. Up to 65 % of Cl was reduced through ultrasonic wave pretreatment. Addition of CaO and construction & demolition waste(C&D) powder inhibited the mobilization of heavy metals with rainfall tremendously, among which Cr and Cu, in particular, was cut by 80 - 100 % in aqueous. Compared with being stacked and abandoned inside the workshop, heat and direct sunlight largely accelerated the degradation of pyrethroids.

40|$|In the Netherlands, green {{residues}} such as verge grass are {{a possible}} alternative to (partially) replace traditional fossil fuels. A feasible {{way of doing}} this, without large modification costs on existing power plants, is biomass co-firing. However, grass has high moisture content, poor grindability properties and high ash content, which have prevented it from being directly co-combusted. Pre-treatments consisting of mechanical dewatering and thermal treatment (torrefaction) could greatly improve the feedstock properties in an energy efficient way. This study firstly investigates the effect of mechanical fractionation on the biomass composition, with focus on the mass losses of carbohydrates, lignin, extractives and <b>inorganic</b> <b>matters</b> during pressing. Secondly, an experimental bench-top, batch torrefaction setup was built. This test rig could provide valuable data from drying and torrefaction experiments, {{which could be used}} for modeling purposes and operating experiences for designing a larger-scale torrefaction plant in the future. Also, a preliminary study on the biomass torrefaction behavior was done by analyzing the experimental products. Mechanical dewatering was found to be quite effective for handling herbaceous biomass feedstock as it removes approximately 30 % of the moisture; this pre-treatment also improves the biomass quality by removing about half of the <b>inorganic</b> <b>matters,</b> which could cause slagging and fouling problems during combustion. Besides this, chemical analysis incorporating extraction, hydrolysis and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) showed that pressing had removed about 10 wt% of the carbohydrates and 20 wt% of acid insoluble lignin. In addition, studies on extractive free samples proved that extractives had a catalytic effect on the thermal reactivity of biomass, which means that removal of extractives could lead to (slightly) higher thermal decomposition temperature. Depending on the process conditions, dried biomass will suffer a 20 % - 50 % mass loss during torrefaction. Results from the chemical analysis on the torrefied grass had shown the reduction of carbohydrates content at different torrefaction temperatures. The resulted solid product, biochar, has a higher energy density than the primary feedstock and it is easier to store and transport. Also, torrefaction makes the biomass feedstock more brittle and less fibrous, which would benefit the fuel preparation for co-firing.
