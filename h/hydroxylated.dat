5|$|As much as 80% of {{therapeutic}} doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver. Conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid, and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact {{is referred to}} as the acyl glucuronide; the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also <b>hydroxylated</b> to gentisic acid. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important.|$|E
25|$|Mescaline is biosynthesized from {{tyrosine}} or a <b>hydroxylated</b> phenylalanine. In Lophophora williamsii (Peyote), dopamine converts into mescaline in a biosynthetic pathway involving m-O-methylation and aromatic hydroxylation.|$|E
25|$|Parecoxib sodium is a {{water-soluble}} inactive ester amide prodrug of valdecoxib, a novel second-generation COX-2-specific inhibitor and {{the first}} such agent to be developed for injectable use. It is rapidly converted by hepatic enzymatic hydrolysis to the active form valdecoxib. The compound then undergoes another conversion, which involves both cytochrome P450-mediated pathway (CYP2C9, CYP3A4) and non-cytochrome P450-mediated pathway, to <b>hydroxylated</b> metabolite and glucuronide metabolite. The <b>hydroxylated</b> metabolite, that also has weak COX-2-specific inhibitory properties, is then further metabolized by non-cytochrome P450 pathway to a glucuronide metabolite. These metabolites are excreted in the urine.|$|E
25|$|In drying seeds, {{serotonin}} {{production is}} a {{way to get rid of}} the buildup of poisonous ammonia. The ammonia is collected and placed in the indole part of L-tryptophan, which is then decarboxylated by tryptophan decarboxylase to give tryptamine, which is then <b>hydroxylated</b> by a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, yielding serotonin.|$|E
25|$|Calcifediol is {{transported to}} the {{proximal}} tubules of the kidneys, where it is <b>hydroxylated</b> at the 1-α position (lower right of the molecule) to form calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, 1,25(OH)2D). The conversion of calcifediol to calcitriol is catalyzed by the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-hydroxylase, which {{is the product of}} the CYP27B1 human gene. The activity of CYP27B1 is increased by parathyroid hormone, and also by low calcium or phosphate.|$|E
25|$|Children are {{particularly}} affected by aflatoxin exposure, {{which leads to}} stunted growth, delayed development, liver damage, and liver cancer. Adults have a higher tolerance to exposure, but are also at risk. No animal species is immune. Aflatoxins {{are among the most}} carcinogenic substances known. After entering the body, aflatoxins may be metabolized by the liver to a reactive epoxide intermediate or <b>hydroxylated</b> to become the less harmful aflatoxin M1.|$|E
25|$|PAHs {{transform}} {{slowly to}} a wide range of degradation products. Biological degradation by microbes is a dominant form of PAH transformation in the environment. Soil-consuming invertebrates such as earthworms speed PAH degradation, either through direct metabolism or by improving the conditions for microbial transformations. Abiotic degradation in the atmosphere and the top layers of surface waters can produce nitrogenated, halogenated, <b>hydroxylated,</b> and oxygenated PAHs; some of these compounds can be more toxic, water-soluble, and mobile than their parent PAHs.|$|E
25|$|In animals, {{biosynthesis}} of melatonin occurs through hydroxylation, decarboxylation, acetylation and a methylation {{starting with}} L-tryptophan. L-tryptophan {{is produced in}} the shikimate pathway from chorismate or is acquired from protein catabolism. First L-tryptophan is <b>hydroxylated</b> on the indole ring by tryptophan hydroxylase to produce 5-hydroxytryptophan. This intermediate (5-HTP) is decarboxylated by pyridoxal phosphate and 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase to produce serotonin. Serotonin is itself an important neurotransmitter, but is also converted into N-acetylserotonin by serotonin N-acetyltransferase and acetyl-CoA. Hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase and S-adenosyl methionine convert N-acetylserotonin into melatonin through methylation of the hydroxyl group.|$|E
25|$|Cystatin C is a non-glycosylated, basic protein (isoelectric {{point at}} pH 9.3). The crystal {{structure}} of cystatin C {{is characterized by}} a short alpha helix and a long alpha helix which lies across a large antiparallel, five-stranded beta sheet. Like other type 2 cystatins, it has two disulfide bonds. Around 50% of the molecules carry a <b>hydroxylated</b> proline. Cystatin C forms dimers (molecule pairs) by exchanging subdomains; in the paired state, each half is made up of the long alpha helix and one beta strand of one partner, and four beta strands of the other partner.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to conjugation and the 17-ketosteroid pathway, testosterone {{can also be}} <b>hydroxylated</b> and oxidized in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. 6β-Hydroxylation {{and to a lesser}} extent 16β-hydroxylation are the major transformations. The 6β-hydroxylation of testosterone is catalyzed mainly by CYP3A4 {{and to a lesser extent}} CYP3A5 and is responsible for 75 to 80% of cytochrome P450-mediated testosterone metabolism. In {{addition to}} 6β- and 16β-hydroxytestosterone, 1β-, 2α/β-, 11β-, and 15β-hydroxytestosterone are also formed as minor metabolites. Certain cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 can also oxidize testosterone at the C17 position to form androstenedione.|$|E
25|$|Sibutramine is well absorbed {{from the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract (77%), but undergoes considerable first-pass metabolism, reducing its bioavailability. The drug itself reaches its {{peak plasma level}} after 1 hour and has also a half-life of 1 hour. Sibutramine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP3A4 into two pharmacologically-active primary and secondary amines (called active metabolites 1 and 2) with half-lives of 14 and 16 hours, respectively. Peak plasma concentrations of active metabolites 1 and 2 are reached after three to four hours. The following metabolic pathway mainly results in two inactive conjugated and <b>hydroxylated</b> metabolites (called metabolites 5 and 6). Metabolites 5 and 6 are mainly excreted in the urine.|$|E
25|$|Azathioprine is a prodrug, a {{substance}} {{that is not an}} active drug itself but is activated in the body. This happens in several steps; at first it is slowly and almost completely converted to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) by reductive cleavage of the thioether (–S–). This is mediated by glutathione and similar compounds in the intestinal wall, the liver and on red blood cells, without the aid of enzymes. 6-MP is metabolized analogously to natural purines, giving thioguanosine triphosphate (TGTP) and thio-deoxyguanosine triphosphate (TdGTP) via thioinosine monophosphate (TIMP) and several further intermediates. On a second path, the sulfur atom of 6-MP and TIMP is methylated. The end products of azathioprine metabolism are thiouric acid (38%) and various methylated and <b>hydroxylated</b> purines, which are excreted via the urine.|$|E
25|$|Erythropoietin {{levels in}} blood are quite {{low in the}} absence of anemia, at around 10 mU/ml. However, in hypoxic stress, EPO {{production}} may increase up to 1000-fold, reaching 10,000 mU/ml of blood. In adults, EPO is synthesized mainly by interstitial cells in the peritubular capillary bed of the renal cortex, with additional amounts being produced in the liver, and the pericytes in the brain. Regulation is believed to rely on a feedback mechanism measuring blood oxygenation and iron availability. Constitutively synthesized transcription factors for EPO, known as hypoxia-inducible factors, are <b>hydroxylated</b> and proteosomally digested in the presence of oxygen and iron. During normoxia GATA2 inhibits the promoter region for EPO. GATA2 levels decrease during hypoxia and allow the promotion of EPO production.|$|E
25|$|Tyrosine and {{phenylalanine}} {{serve as}} the metabolic precursors to synthesis of mescaline. Tyrosine can either undergo a decarboxylation via tyrosine decarboxylase to generate tyramine and subsequently undergo an oxidation at carbon 3 by a monophenol hydroxylase or first be <b>hydroxylated</b> by tyrosine hydroxylase to form L-DOPA and decarboxylated by DOPA decarboxylase. These create dopamine, which then experiences methylation by a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) by an S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent mechanism. The resulting intermediate is then oxidized again by a hydroxylase enzyme, likely monophenol hydroxylase again, at carbon 5, and methylated by COMT. The product, methylated at the two meta positions {{with respect to the}} alkyl substituent, experiences a final methylation at the 4 carbon by a guaiacol-O-methyltransferase, which also operates by a SAM-dependent mechanism. This final methylation step results in the production of mescaline.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin is {{extensively}} metabolized by {{the liver}} via oxidation and N-demethylation. Based on in vitro research, the major enzymes {{involved in the}} metabolism of doxepin are the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, with CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 also involved to a lesser extent. The major active metabolite of doxepin, nordoxepin, is formed mainly by CYP2C19 (>50% contribution), while CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 are involved to a lesser extent, and CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are not involved. Both doxepin and nordoxepin are <b>hydroxylated</b> mainly by CYP2D6, and both doxepin and nordoxepin are also transformed into glucuronide conjugates. The elimination half-life of doxepin is about 15–18hours, whereas that of nordoxepin is around 28–31hours. Up to 10% of Caucasian individuals show substantially reduced metabolism of doxepin that can result in up to 8-fold elevated plasma concentrations of the drug compared to normal.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} common methods of {{antifouling}} comes from growing polymer chains from a surface, often by poly(ethylene glycol) or PEG. However, challenges exist in creating a functionalized surface to which PEG chains may be grown, especially in aqueous environments. Researchers {{have been able to}} study the methods by which the common blue mussel Mytilus edulis is able to adhere to solid surfaces in marine environments using mussel adhesive proteins, or MAPs. MAPs typically comprise several proteins, of which the most common repeating sequence is Ala-Lys-Pro-Ser-Tyr-trans-2,3-cis-3,4-dihydroxyproline (DHP) -Hyp-Thr-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) -Lys. The inclusion of the <b>hydroxylated</b> DHP and DOPA amino acids is thought to contribute to the adhesive nature of the MAPs. Recent studies have looked into using a short chain of DOPA residues as an adhesive end-group for antifouling PEG polymers which show promise in adsorbing onto certain metal surfaces. Increasing the number of DOPA residues to three greatly improves the total amount of adsorbed DOPA-PEG polymers and exhibits antifouling properties exceeding most other 'grafting-to' polymeric functionalization methods.|$|E
2500|$|Heme D {{is another}} {{derivative}} of heme B, but {{in which the}} propionic acid side chain at the carbon of position 6, which is also <b>hydroxylated,</b> forms a γ-spirolactone. Ring III is also <b>hydroxylated</b> at position 5, in a conformation trans to the new lactone group. [...] Heme D is the site for oxygen reduction to water of many types of bacteria at low oxygen tension.|$|E
2500|$|... siRNAs have a {{well-defined}} structure: a short (usually 20 to 24-bp) double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with phosphorylated 5' ends and <b>hydroxylated</b> 3' ends with two overhanging nucleotides.|$|E
2500|$|Many eukaryotes {{have the}} ability to {{synthesize}} carnitine, including humans. [...] Humans synthesize carnitine from the substrate TML (6-N-trimethyllysine), which is in turn derived from the methylation of the amino acid lysine. [...] TML is then <b>hydroxylated</b> into hydroxytrimethyllysine (HTML) by trimethyllysine dioxygenase, requiring the presence of ascorbic acid. [...] HTML is then cleaved by HTML aldose, yielding 4-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde (TMABA) and glycine. [...] TMABA is then dehydrogenated into gamma-butyrobetaine, in an NAD+-dependent reaction, catalyzed by TMABA dehydrogenase. [...] Gamma-butyrobetaine is then <b>hydroxylated</b> by gamma butyrobetaine hydroxylase into L-carnitine, requiring iron in the form of Fe2+.|$|E
2500|$|Whether {{it is made}} in {{the skin}} or ingested, {{cholecalciferol}} is <b>hydroxylated</b> in the liver at position 25 (upper right of the molecule) to form 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (calcifediol or 25(OH)D). This reaction is catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme vitamin D 25-hydroxylase, the product of the CYP2R1 human gene, and expressed by hepatocytes. Once made, the product is released into the plasma, where it is bound to an α-globulin carrier protein named the [...] vitamin D-binding protein.|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "benzene" [...] derives {{historically}} from [...] "gum benzoin" [...] (benzoin resin), an aromatic resin {{known to}} European pharmacists and perfumers since the 15th {{century as a}} product of southeast Asia. An acidic material was derived from benzoin by sublimation, and named [...] "flowers of benzoin", or benzoic acid. The hydrocarbon derived from benzoic acid thus acquired the name benzin, benzol, or benzene. Michael Faraday first isolated and identified benzene in 1825 from the oily residue derived from the production of illuminating gas, giving it the name bicarburet of hydrogen.H6, although he doesn't realize it because he (like most chemists at that time) used the wrong atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12). In 1833, Eilhard Mitscherlich produced it by distilling benzoic acid (from gum benzoin) and lime. He gave the compound the name benzin. In 1836, the French chemist Auguste Laurent named the substance [...] "phène"; this word has become the root of the English word [...] "phenol", which is <b>hydroxylated</b> benzene, and [...] "phenyl", the radical formed by abstraction of a hydrogen atom (free radical H•) from benzene.|$|E
2500|$|Vitamin D {{from the}} diet or skin {{synthesis}} is biologically inactive; enzymatic conversion (hydroxylation) {{in the liver}} and kidney is required for activation. [...] As vitamin D can be synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sufficient sunlight, {{it is not an}} essential dietary factor, and so not technically a vitamin. [...] Instead it could be considered as a hormone, with activation of the vitamin D pro-hormone resulting in the active form, calcitriol, which then produces effects via a nuclear receptor in multiple different locations. [...] Cholecalciferol is converted in the liver to calcifediol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol); ergocalciferol is converted to 25-hydroxyergocalciferol. [...] These two vitamin D metabolites (called 25-hydroxyvitamin D or 25(OH)D) are measured in serum to determine a person's vitamin D status. [...] Calcifediol is further <b>hydroxylated</b> by the kidneys to form calcitriol (also known as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol), the biologically active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the blood, having a major role regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate, and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of bone. Calcitriol also has other effects, including some on cell growth, neuromuscular and immune functions, and reduction of inflammation.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the exact}} route of {{vanillin}} biosynthesis in V. planifolia is currently unknown, several pathways are proposed for its biosynthesis. Vanillin biosynthesis is generally {{agreed to be}} part of the phenylpropanoid pathway starting with L-phenylalanine, which is deaminated by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) to form t-cinnamic acid. The para position of the ring is then <b>hydroxylated</b> by the cytochrome P450 enzyme cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H/P450) to create p-coumaric acid. Then, in the proposed ferulate pathway, 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA ligase (4CL) attaches p-coumaric acid to coenzyme A (CoA) to create p-coumaroyl CoA. Hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT) then converts p-coumaroyl CoA to 4-coumaroyl shikimate/quinate. This subsequently undergoes oxidation by the P450 enzyme coumaroyl ester 3’-hydroxylase (C3’H/P450) to give caffeoyl shikimate/quinate. HCT then exchanges the shikimate/quinate for CoA to create caffeoyl CoA, and 4CL removes CoA to afford caffeic acid. Caffeic acid then undergoes methylation by caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) to give ferulic acid. Finally, vanillin synthase hydratase/lyase (vp/VAN) catalyzes hydration of the double bond in ferulic acid followed by a retro-aldol elimination to afford vanillin. Vanillin can also be produced from vanilla glycoside with the additional final step of deglycosylation. In the past p-hydroxybenzaldehyde was speculated to be a precursor for vanillin biosynthesis. However, recently it was demonstrated by radiolabelled precursor studies that [...] p-hydroxybenzaldehyde do not synthesis vanillin or vanillin glucoside in the vanilla orchids.|$|E
50|$|Cholecalciferol is then <b>hydroxylated</b> in {{the liver}} to become {{calcifediol}} (25-hydroxyvitamin D3). Calcifediol is then <b>hydroxylated</b> again in the kidney, and becomes calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) or active vitamin D3.|$|E
50|$|For many PAHs it {{has been}} proven that they are conjugated, in phase II, with either glucuronide, sulfate or glutathione. More {{research}} on this topic is necessary for benzocfluorene. Glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of PAH metabolites are generally excreted in the bile and urine.Glutathione conjugates are further metabolized to mercapturic acids in the kidney and are excreted in the urine. The <b>hydroxylated</b> metabolites of the PAHs are excreted in human urine both as free <b>hydroxylated</b> metabolites and as <b>hydroxylated</b> metabolites conjugated to glucuronic acid and sulfate.|$|E

50|$|JWH-018 {{administered}} to rats {{resulted in the}} excretion of an indole-N-desalkyl metabolite {{as well as several}} <b>hydroxylated</b> metabolites in urine. The highest signals were observed for the <b>hydroxylated</b> N-desalkyl metabolites. Hydroxylation took place on the side chain and in both aromatic systems, the naphthalene and the indole rings, as could be shown by mass shift of the corresponding fragments and by MS3 experiments. Human metabolites were similar although most metabolism took place on the indole ring and pentyl side chain, and the <b>hydroxylated</b> metabolites were extensively conjugated with glucuronide.|$|E

50|$|The most {{frequently}} <b>hydroxylated</b> residue in human proteins is proline. This {{is due to}} the fact that collagen makes up about 25-35% of the protein in our bodies and contains a hydroxyproline at almost every 3rd residue in its amino acid sequence. Hydroxylation occurs at the γ-C atom, forming hydroxyproline (Hyp), which stabilizes the secondary structure of collagen due to the strong electronegative effects of oxygen. Proline hydroxylation is also a vital component of hypoxia response via hypoxia inducible factors. In some cases, proline may be <b>hydroxylated</b> instead on its β-C atom. Lysine may also be <b>hydroxylated</b> on its δ-C atom, forming hydroxylysine (Hyl).|$|E
5000|$|Based on {{deuterium}} tracking studies, the biosynthetic pathway for aubucin {{from the}} cyclized lactone intermediate is organism specific. [...] In Gardenia jasminoides, the cyclized lactone intermediate is glycosylated to form boschnaloside that is then <b>hydroxylated</b> on C10; boschnaloside is oxidized to geniposidic acid; geniposidic acid is then decarboxylated to form bartisioside; bartisioside is then <b>hydroxylated</b> to form aucubin. The Scrophularia umbrosa biosynthetic pathway {{is different from}} Gardenia jasminoides. In Scrophularia umbrosa, the lactone intermediate is glycosylated and oxidized at the C11 carbonyl to form 8-epi-dexoy-loganic acid, which is then converted to deoxygeniposidic acid; deoxygeniposidic acid is <b>hydroxylated</b> at C10 to geniposidic acid; decarboxylation and hydroxylation of C6 leads to aubucin.|$|E
