During multiplayer games, each player will only see their respective screen (in full HD) appear on the television through their respective 3D glasses, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> a split screen (e.g. player 1 will only see player 1's screen displayed through their 3D glasses).|$|E
25|$|The Biblical prophets, {{including}} Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah, had {{a concept}} of the divine that differed significantly {{from that of the}} nature religions. According to Jewish mythology, their lives were full of miracles, signs, and visions from God that kept Jewish mythology alive, growing, and distinct from the pagan mythologies of its neighbors. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> the God of Israel as just one national god, these prophets saw him as the one God of the entire universe.|$|E
25|$|Josie {{arrives in}} Albert Square in August 1998 {{to visit her}} son, Mick McFarlane (Sylvester Williams) whom she {{believes}} {{to be a successful}} musician. However, Mick's music career failed and he has ended up selling CD's on a market stall in the Square, as well as running the Bridge Street café's night bistro. Josie, who has high aspirations for herself and her family, is not pleased to find out that her son has been lying about his professional status, but Josie also harbours a few secrets of her own. Josie's husband recently died, but before his death he was defrauded in a Jamaican property scam, leaving Josie bankrupt. Josie fosters a young girl named Kim (Krystle Williams), whom she claims is a distant relative of Mick's. Kim is the illegitimate daughter of her philandering husband, and after her mother's death, Josie kindly took her in <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> her go into care. When Mick is finally made privy to this information he is extremely shocked and even more surprised to find out that both Josie and Kim plan to stay in Walford instead of returning to Jamaica. Despite his initial misgivings, Mick soon welcomes his mother and new sister into his home. Josie and Kim later move into number 3c Albert Square, where Josie becomes friendly with her downstairs neighbours, Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Lilly Mattock (Barbara Keogh), although Josie and Dot bicker constantly.|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers made {{extensive}} use of macro photography. Production designer Shepherd Frankel said, [...] "It's more visually interesting to depict things from Ant-Man's point of view <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> him from a normal perspective. But we wanted a realistic realization, not Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with its oversized set pieces." [...] Rebecca Baehler served {{as the director of}} macro photography, taking cues from Carpenter. Carpenter said vibration became [...] "a tremendous problem" [...] when moving the camera during the macro photography because [...] "one inch off the ground is like fifteen feet in the air. From an ant's perspective, you move four inches, to a human perspective, that's a football field!" [...] The solution required the filmmakers to search for a creative solution, so they turned to Baehler, who had a background in commercial [...] "tabletop" [...] photography. In order to add Rudd's performance as Ant-Man when in the macro world, a Centroid facial capture set up was used, with a five-camera array of Alexas surrounding Rudd. Rosenfeld explained, [...] "One camera was set up vertically while the others were horizontal with overlapping image areas, all set to record at 48 frames per second. This maximized resolution and provided 3D modeling [...] Paul's performance." [...] Reed would then call out story moments with Rudd performing [...] "facial expressions that would later be composited on a CG Ant-Man." ...|$|E
500|$|Soap opera {{commentator}} Jenn Bishop {{said she}} {{found it difficult to}} explain Todd's popularity, and that if she is perplexed about her feelings regarding him, it is understandable that others would be as well. [...] "If I were to give a surface level assessment of Todd, I'd say he's an abhorrent character with little to no redeeming qualities," [...] she said. [...] "His actions, which span from the immoral to criminal, can be downright heinous. I wouldn't want to know Todd, let alone be around him in real life. Nor would I want any woman to have any sort of relationship with him." [...] <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> Todd as an antihero, she saw him as more of [...] "an anti-anti-hero" [...] and stated that what added to his appeal was that his rape storyline was authentic. [...] "While Todd is not the first (or the last) soap character to have committed this crime, the realness of this particular storyline didn't leave {{a lot of room for}} rewrites," [...] Bishop commented. [...] "For example, Luke's rape of Laura on General Hospital was rewritten and for years was referred to as a 'seduction.' There was no 'grey area'. This [...] could not be dismissed as simply the behavior of a romantic rogue." [...] To Bishop, the end result of this aspect, and that the writers had Todd generally pay for his crimes, [...] "was the development of a dynamic, unpredictable, multi-faceted character with many traits that conflict with one another" [...] and [...] "ll this makes for one messed up guy, intriguing to the viewers and one I can't help but like".|$|E

2500|$|Some Greek {{philosophers}} went further. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> {{each event}} {{as an act}} of will, they developed a notion of impersonal, universal law: they finally abandoned mythopoeic thought, postulating impersonal laws behind all natural phenomena. These philosophers may not have been scientific by today's rigid standards: their hypotheses were often based on assumptions, not empirical data. However, by the mere fact that they looked behind the apparent diversity and individuality of events in search of underlying laws, and defied [...] "the prescriptive sanctities of religion", the Greeks broke away from mythopoeic thought.|$|E
2500|$|The classic {{symptom of}} {{keratoconus}} {{is the perception}} of multiple [...] "ghost" [...] images, known as monocular polyopia. This effect is most clearly seen with a high contrast field, such {{as a point of}} light on a dark background. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> just one point, a person with keratoconus sees many images of the point, spread out in a chaotic pattern. This pattern does not typically change from day to day, but over time, it often takes on new forms. People also commonly notice streaking and flaring distortion around light sources. Some even notice the images moving relative to one another in time with their heart beat.|$|E
60|$|To this {{question}} his daughter replied {{only with a}} laugh; and {{as it had been}} asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> his <b>seeing</b> too little, she might have fancied too much.|$|R

At that point, Jesse explains that if given the choice, he would marry her <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> never <b>seeing</b> her again.

2500|$|Eventually, Răutu {{resigned}} {{himself to}} adopting Gheorghiu-Dej's view. He is purported {{as the author}} of a Jewish self-hatred catchphrase, taken up by the (predominantly Romanian PMR) leaders: [...] "Jews should lose their habit of controlling things". As the party began expelling significant numbers of its Jewish members, a confidential note circulated at the top confirmed that, even in 1958, Răutu was expressing strongly antisemitic feelings. According to one eyewitness account, Răutu attacked artist Iosif Molnár for having illustrated the Romanian edition of Anne Frank's Diary with a stylized yellow badge. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> this {{as a symbol of the}} Holocaust, Răutu accused Molnár of promoting Zionism, then ordered him to attend a [...] "self-criticism" [...] session.|$|E
2500|$|However, his {{positive}} impact on television became a negative one for Broadway. Caesar fans preferred to stay home on Saturday nights to watch his show <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> live plays. [...] "The Caesar show became such a Saturday-night must-see habit—the Saturday Night Live of its day," [...] states Nachman, that [...] "...Broadway producers begged NBC to switch the show to midweek." [...] Comedy star Carol Burnett, who later had her own hit TV show, remembers winning tickets to see My Fair Lady on Broadway: [...] "I gave the tickets to my roommate because I said, Fair Lady's gonna be running for a hundred years, but Sid Caesar is live and I'll never see that again." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} Austen was writing, the {{historical}} novels of Walter Scott and early realist novels of Maria Edgeworth had already initiated the realist tradition. Austen's novels are sometimes {{seen as an}} outgrowth of these new genres. In an early review of Emma, Scott himself praised Austen's ability to copy [...] "from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the [...] correct and striking representation of that which is daily taking place around him". However, as Austen scholar William Galperin has argued, Austen could not have participated in 19th-century realism—the realism with which she later became associated—because it {{had not yet been}} fully defined. He argues Austen's novels were part of the beginning phases of realism. Therefore, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> Austen as a realist writer, he sees her as a picturesque writer on the cusp of realism. Her attention to detail, probability, and oppositionality, lead him to call her the [...] "historian of the everyday".|$|E

2500|$|... "Hegelianism {{promised to}} make {{absolute}} knowledge available {{by virtue of}} a science of logic. Anyone with the capacity to follow the dialectical progression of the purportedly transparent concepts of Hegel's logic would {{have access to the}} mind of God (which for Hegel was equivalent to the logical structure of the universe). Kierkegaard thought this to be the hubristic attempt to build a new tower of Babel, or a scala paradisi — a dialectical ladder by which humans can climb with ease up to heaven. Kierkegaard's strategy was to invert this dialectic by seeking to make everything more difficult. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> scientific knowledge as the means of human redemption, he regarded it as the greatest obstacle to redemption. Instead of seeking to give people more knowledge he sought to take away what passed for knowledge. Instead of seeking to make God and Christian faith perfectly intelligible he sought to emphasize the absolute transcendence by God of all human categories. Instead of setting himself up as a religious authority, Kierkegaard used a vast array of textual devices to undermine his authority as an author and to place responsibility for the existential significance to be derived from his texts squarely on the reader."

2500|$|Ruiz de Burton is {{critical}} of US foreign policy in her fiction, accusing it of imperialist and hegemonic tendencies, contradictory to its intentions and foundation. [...] In 1823, US President James Monroe delivered a statement declaring the US foreign policy regarding the Western Hemisphere henceforth, which became later known as the Monroe Doctrine. [...] His message declared that the Western Hemisphere's move toward democracy and away from monarchy was inevitable and that the United States would usher in that transformation and protect {{any country in the}} Americas from future colonization by any European powers. [...] This Doctrine remained virtually ignored in US politics until President James Polk told Congress in 1845 that [...] "The American system of government is entirely different from that of Europe...a system of self-government which seems natural to our soil and which will ever resist foreign interference". [...] However, the character Don Felipe in The Squatter and the Don says [...] "Of course the ideas of this continent are different from those of Europe, be we all know that such would not be the case if the influence of the United States did not prevail with such despotic sway over the minds of the leading men of the Hispanic American republics. [...] If it were not for this terrible, this fatal influence - which will eventually destroy us- the Mexicans, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> anything objectionable in the proposed change, would be proud to hail a prince who, after all, has some sore of claim to this land, and who will cut us loose from the leading strings of the United States." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 7 August 1793 General of Division Hilarion Paul Puget de Barbantane {{accepted}} the army command from the representatives on mission, assuring {{them that he}} wanted to [...] "wash out his original sin" [...] of being an aristocrat. At the same time, General of Division Luc Siméon Auguste Dagobert was sent inland with 3,000 reinforcements to the Cerdagne. Dagobert with 6,500 soldiers defeated Manuel la Peña at Puigcerdà on 28 August. Meanwhile, Ricardos pursued a strategy of surrounding Perpignan by fortified camps. He built camps at Argelès-sur-Mer to the southeast, [...] Ponteilla to the southwest, Olette to the west and Peyrestortes to the northwest. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> an opportunity to strike at the dispersed Spanish army, Barbantane was seized with fright. Leaving General of Division Eustache Charles d'Aoust in charge of Perpignan, Barbantane retreated with one division to Salses-le-Château, then the terrified man went to Narbonne to look for reinforcements. Finally, Barbantane wrote his resignation which was accepted. He was of course arrested, but amazingly he avoided the guillotine. Napoleon later described him as [...] "useless". In the crisis, the government sent for General of Division Louis Marie Turreau to lead the army. To fill the command vacuum, the representatives on mission called for the return of Dagobert from the Cerdagne, appointed d'Aoust as temporary commander and named General of Brigade Jacques Gilles Henri Goguet, a former doctor, to lead the division at Salses. In the Battle of Peyrestortes on 17 September, d'Aoust with 8,000 troops defeated Lieutenant General Juan de Courten's 6,000 men. Since Spanish had occupied Vernet on the outskirts of Perpignan, d'Aoust attacked and recaptured this position in the morning. In the evening d'Aoust, Goguet and Representative Joseph Cassanyes improvised a successful assault on the camp at Peyrestortes, driving the Spanish forces south of the Têt River and capturing 500 men, 43 guns and seven colors. The cautious Ricardos never budged while his camps were being overrun and the French soon recovered Villefranche-de-Conflent as well.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we explore issues of {{embodied}} control that relate to current and future technologies in which body movements function as an instrument <b>of</b> control. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> just <b>seeing</b> ourselves in control, {{it is time to}} consider how these technologies actually control our moving bodies and transform our lived spaces. By shifting the focus from devices to choreographies among devices, we perform a theoretical analysis of the multidimensional aspects that reside within embodied interaction with technology. We suggest that it is beneficial to acknowledge and reformulate the phenomena of embodied control that go beyond the instrumental user-to-device control scheme. Drawing upon the phenomenology of the body, ecological psychology, and embodied cognitive science, we identify three different dimensions of embodied control: instrumental, experiential, and infrastructural.
