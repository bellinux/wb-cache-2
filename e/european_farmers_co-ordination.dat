40|$|Abstract Background Tracing {{the genetic}} origin of central <b>European</b> <b>farmer</b> N 1 a {{lineages}} {{can provide a}} unique opportunity to assess the patterns of the farming technology spread into central Europe in the human prehistory. Here, we have chosen twelve N 1 a samples from modern populations which are most similar with the farmer N 1 a types and performed the complete mitochondrial DNA genome sequencing analysis. To assess the genetic and phylogeographic relationship, we performed a detailed survey of modern published N 1 a types from Eurasian and African populations. Results The geographic origin and expansion of farmer lineages related N 1 a subclades have been deduced from combined analysis of 19 complete sequences with 166 N 1 a haplotypes. The phylogeographic analysis revealed that the central <b>European</b> <b>farmer</b> lineages have originated from different sources: from eastern Europe, local central Europe, and from the Near East via southern Europe. Conclusions The results obtained emphasize that the arrival of central <b>European</b> <b>farmer</b> lineages did not occur via a single demic diffusion event from the Near East {{at the onset of the}} Neolithic spread of agriculture into Europe. Indeed these results indicate that the Neolithic transition process was more complex in central Europe and possibly the farmer N 1 a lineages were a result of a 'leapfrog' colonization process. </p...|$|R
25|$|Agriculture {{arrived in}} the Netherlands somewhere around 5000 BC with the Linear Pottery culture, who were {{probably}} central <b>European</b> <b>farmers.</b> Agriculture was practised only on the loess plateau in the very south (southern Limburg), but even there it was not established permanently.

50|$|The U.S. in World War I, was a {{critical}} supplier to other Allied nations, as millions of <b>European</b> <b>farmers</b> were in the army.

50|$|Nevertheless, {{the first}} Europeans {{arrived in the}} area in 1760, and the farm Melkhoutkraal (literally {{translating}} from Afrikaans as 'milk wood kraal’) was established on the eastern shore of the Knysna Lagoon. Stephanus Terblans, the first <b>European</b> <b>farmer</b> to settle in the area, was given a loan permit to farm here in 1770.|$|R
50|$|A {{separate}} study analyzed 22 skeletons from European hunter-gatherer sites dated 13400-2300 BC.

50|$|According to Anthony, the {{development}} of the Proto-Indo-European cultures started with the introduction of cattle at the Pontic-Caspian steppes, which until ca. 5200-5000 BCE were populated by hunter-gatherers.
