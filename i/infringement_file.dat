40|$|Recently, P 2 P {{technology}} {{has become so}} popular {{that a large number}} of files are being exchanged by millions of users concurrently. However, due to the significant growth of P 2 P file sharing, even copyrighted files are also actively exchanged so copyright infringement has become a serious issue. In particular, P 2 P file sharing is recognized as a killer application for the P 2 P technology, and several P 2 P file sharing systems have been used by many users from the late 90 ’s to the present, including Napster, Gnutella, Kazaa and Bit Torrent. However, the popularization of such P 2 P file sharing causes several undesired issues in recent years, such as the illegal sharing of copyrighted contents violating the copyright law and the act as a hotbed of cyber-crimes such as phishing scams and leaks of personal information. In this work, we propose a solution to ensure copy right violation in P 2 P systems. Keywords- Peer to Peer systems, copyright <b>infringement,</b> <b>file</b> sharing, digital rights management, pollution attack, index poisoning, watermarking and fingerprinting...|$|E
