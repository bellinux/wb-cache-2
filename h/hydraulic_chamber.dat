5000|$|This {{process is}} based on the 1950s patent for hydramolding by Fred Leuthesser, Jr. and John Fox of the Schaible Company of Cincinnati, Ohio in the United States. It was {{originally}} used in producing kitchen spouts. This was done because in addition to the strengthening of the metal, hydromolding also produced less [...] "grainy" [...] parts, allowing for easier metal finishing.In sheet hydroforming (SHF) there are bladder forming (where there is a bladder that contains the liquid; no liquid contacts the sheet) and hydroforming where the fluid contacts the sheet (no bladder). Bladder forming is sometimes called flexforming. Flexforming is mostly used for low volume productions, as in the aerospace field.Forming with the fluid in direct contact with the part can be done either with a male solid punch (this version is sometimes called hydro-mechanical deep drawing) or with a female solid die.In hydro-mechanical deep drawing, a work piece is placed on a draw ring (blank holder) over a male punch then a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>chamber</b> surrounds the work piece and a relatively low initial pressure seats the work piece against the punch. The punch then is raised into the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>chamber</b> and pressure is increased to as high as 100 MPa (15000 psi) which forms the part around the punch. Then the pressure is released and punch retracted, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>chamber</b> lifted, and the process is complete.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes {{three aspects}} of the comprehensive rotorcraft analysis. First, a physics-based methodology for the modeling of hydraulic devices within multibody-based comprehensive models of rotorcraft systems is developed. This newly proposed approach can predict the fully nonlinear behavior of hydraulic devices, and pressure levels in the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>chambers</b> are coupled with the dynamic response of the system. The proposed model evaluates relevant hydraulic quantities such as chamber pressures, orifice flow rates, and pressure relief valve displacements. This model {{could be used to}} design lead-lag dampers with desirable force and damping characteristics. The second part of this research is in the area of computational aeroelasticity, in which an interface between computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational structural dynamics (CSD) is established. This interface enables data exchange between CFD and CSD with the goal of achieving accurate airloads predictions. In this work, a loose coupling approach based on the delta-airload method is developed in a finite-element method based multibody dynamics formulation, DYMORE. A loose coupling analysis between a CFD code, OVERFLOW- 2, and a CSD program, DYMORE, is performed to validate this aerodynamic interface. The ability to accurately capture the wake structure around a helicopter rotor is crucial for rotorcraft performance analysis. In the third part of this thesis, a new representation of the wake vortex structure based on Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) curves and surfaces is proposed to develop an efficient model for prescribed and free wakes. The proposed formulation has the potential to reduce the computational cost {{associated with the use of}} the Helmholtz¡¯s law and the Biot-Savart law when calculating the induced flow field around the rotor. An efficient free wake analysis will considerably decrease the computational cost of comprehensive rotorcraft analysis, making the approach more attractive to routine use in industrial settings. Ph.

40|$|A physics based {{methodology}} for modeling of hydraulic devices within multibody-based comprehensive models of rotorcraft systems is developed. The proposed models are developed in two stages. At first, models are developed for three basic hydraulic elements: the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>chamber,</b> the hydraulic orifice {{and the pressure}} relief valve. These models consist of nonlinear differential equations involving empirical parameters. Next, these basic elements are combined to yield device models for linear hydraulic actuators, simple hydraulic dampers, and hydraulic dampers with pressure relief valves. The proposed hydraulic device models are implemented in a multibody code and calibrated by comparing their predictions with test bench measurements for the UH- 60 helicopter lead-lag damper. While predicted peak damping forces {{are found to be}} in good agreement with measurements, the model does not predict the entire time history of damper force to the same level of accuracy. The validated model of the UH- 60 lead-lag damper model is coupled with a comprehensive model of the vehicle. Measured aerodynamic loads are applied to the blade and predicted damper forces are compared with experimental measurements. A marked improvement in the prediction is observed when using the proposed model rather than a linear approximation of the damper behavior.

40|$|Stiffness {{has long}} since governed the way people choose automobiles. Stiffer {{suspensions}} allow for the better handling necessary in sporty cars while softer suspensions provide the comfort expected in luxury cars. Automobiles have also been limited by ride height: a higher ride height will yield more clearance from bumps along the ground. However, lower ride height lowers {{the center of gravity}} of the car, which is desired for safety. The purpose of this work is to propose a way of using axiomatic design to device a system that uses orifice controlled dampers, pneumatic springs and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>chambers</b> to achieve a fully customizable suspension system and ride height regulation. In addition, a way to create the best possible user experience is proposed by using control theory to keep the car chassis at the same level at all times, thus giving the user the ability to have a smooth ride at any suspension setting, even stiff suspension systems in the case of sporty car settings. To achieve the goals of this work, a short-long arm (SLA) suspension system was modeled and modified. The SLA suspension system is the most common front wheel independent suspension system that is used today. (cont.) By keeping a similar overall design for the proposed system, adaptability of the proposed system is increased. The coil spring of the common SLA suspension system is replaced by an air spring with a fluid chamber in series. The air spring has a variable spring stiffness that is related to the volume of air inside. Because air is compressible, the volume changes with the force applied, yielding a nonlinear relationship that must be compensated for by an active control system that monitors the overall volume of the air spring and compensates for any changes during use by addition or removal of air. The fluid chamber is responsible for keeping the chassis at the same level at all times by taking into account the changing volume of the air spring and the changes in the road by having incompressible fluid pumped {{in and out of the}} chamber. by Amy L.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{technique has}} been developed {{that is capable of}} (1) controlling the triaxial stress state in the specimen, (2) dynamically loading the specimen in multiaxial compression, and (3) allowing the recovery of the sample after loaded by a single and well-defined pulse for the characterization of the failure mode. Hydrostatic pressure is introduced to the test section of a compression Kolsky bar to create dynamic triaxial loading conditions on sand specimens. Both the test section and the free end of the transmission bar in a Kolsky bar setup are fitted with two <b>hydraulic</b> pressure <b>chambers.</b> After a desired hydrostatic pressure is applied to the specimen, an impact-generated axial load is applied through the incident bar for characterizing the dynamic shear response. Quasi-static and dynamic triaxial compression experiments have been performed on Quikrete # 1961 ® fine grain dry sand. The sand specimens are confined triaxially and the amount of confining pressure (25 - 150 MPa) is varied by controlling hydraulic pressure. The profile of the dynamic loading pulse is controlled through pulse shaping such that the specimens deform at constant axial engineering strain rates under uniform dynamic stresses. The experimental results show that the compressive stress-strain response of the sand is sensitive to hydrostatic pressure levels but insensitive to strain rates. After test, specimens are investigated using gradation, particle breakage factor and surface morphology. The effect of dynamic loading on the failure behavior of sand grain shows ductile to brittle failure transition. ...|$|R

40|$|Cylindrical shells {{have large}} {{industrial}} applications ranging from pressure vessels, engine cylinders and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>chambers</b> to chemical and {{power plants and}} they are typically subjected to severe mechanical or thermo-mechanical environmental conditions. The fatigue life, pressure and thermal load bearing capacities of thick-walled cylinders can be considerably improved by inducing near the bore compressive residual hoop stresses. Shrink-fit and autofrettage processes have been effectively applied to generate favorable compressive residual stresses. The main goal of this research study is to fundamentally investigate the compound cylinders subjected to autofrettage and shrink-fit processes and develop new design processing technique and practical design optimization strategies to enhance their fatigue life under cyclic thermo-mechanical loads. First, the residual stresses of compound cylinders subjected to different combinations of shrink-fit and autofrettage processes have been evaluated using the developed finite element model in the ANSYS environment. The stresses due to different cyclic thermo-mechanical loads have also been calculated for the different combinations of compound cylinders considering the fully coupled thermo-elastic finite element model. To validate the finite element model, an experimental setup {{has been designed to}} measure the temperature history at three different locations through the wall thickness and also hoop strain at the outer surface of a two-layer compound cylinder under internal quasi-static and cyclic thermal loads. The experimental results have then been compared with those obtained from the finite element model. Moreover, to compare the performance of compound cylinders under different thermo-mechanical loads, the fatigue life due to cyclic pressure, cyclic thermal pulses and cyclic combined thermo-mechanical pulses has been calculated using ASME code for high pressure vessel. Next, to enhance the residual stress distribution along the wall thickness of the cylinder, a new double autofrettage process has been introduced. In the proposed double autofrettage process, an outer autofrettage cycle is performed prior to a standard inner autofrettage cycle. This can provide an increase in the beneficial compressive residual stresses at the near bore area of the cylinder while decreasing the detrimental tensile residual stress at the outer part of the cylinder. The proposed process has then been utilized to construct new combinations of autofrettage, shrink-fit and double autofrettage processes. The residual stress distribution through the thickness and fatigue life of these new combinations have been evaluated and compared with those based on conventional combinations of shrink-fit and autofrettage processes. Finally, a practical design optimization methodology has been developed to identify the optimal configuration of autofrettaged and shrink-fitted cylinders. Optimization problems based on the high-fidelity finite element model is computationally very expensive and may not render accurate optimum results. Considering this in the presented research, design of experiment (DOE) and response surface method (RSM) have been used in combination with the finite element model to create smooth response surface functions which can accurately describe the behavior of the residual hoop stresses with respect to the change of design variables. The developed response surface functions have been effectively utilized in the design optimization problems to simultaneously maximize the residual compressive hoop stress and minimize the residual tensile hoop stress through the thickness of the compound cylinder. Nonlinear mathematical programming technique based on the powerful sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm has been used in combination with the genetic algorithm (GA) in order to accurately capture the global optimal solutions. At the end, the residual hoop stress distribution and fatigue life of the optimum configurations for each combination of autofrettage and shrink-fit processes have been evaluated and compared. ...|$|R

The accuracy of the bond graph model was verified by comparing its response to the response of an actual hydraulic system and the correlation of these results is high concerning the shape, magnitude and response times. Three different tests were conducted, depending on the motion profile of the valve spool, from which an important conclusion drawn is that a long duration in the valve spool return motion has the most noticeable effect on the maximum vertical travel of the load as it significantly reduces the load oscillation amplitude after the load has reached its topmost position. What follows is an increase of the residual pressure in the <b>hydraulic</b> cylinder top <b>chamber</b> with a lesser effect on the load maximum velocity.

40|$|The engine {{excitation}} forces, {{arising from}} gas pressure and unbalance force, are widely {{considered among the}} main vibration sources for the road vehicles. Even though the current engine mount designs are acceptable for vibration isolation of the transmitted forces from engine to chassis, the performance improvement of the engine mounting system is still required for the tendency of light weight and higher power of the vehicle. In this thesis, a coupled three degree-of-freedom engine mount system with both elastomeric and hydraulic mounts, are developed. The system performance is evaluated through simulation {{with the purpose of}} isolating the vibrations in entire frequency range and under engine excitation force. The engine dynamic model is established based on the analysis of the kinematics and dynamics of its components and gas variation. The unbalanced inertia force caused by engine reciprocating and rotating parts is derived as the vertical excitation force. The net torque, generated by the inertia forces and gas pressure, is formulated using geometrical relationship of the engine components.

In this study the design and performance assessment of a semi-active suspension model of tractor cabin was considered. Tractor full vibration model was developed first, and subsequently a semi-active ON-OFF damper model was designed. The examination of the model indicated that doubling the piston area and the volume of <b>hydraulic</b> accumulator air <b>chamber,</b> led to 39 % increase and 31 % reduction of the resonance frequency of transmitted vibrations to the driver, respectively.

Moreover, the numerical comparison of the model outputs with and without activation of semi-active cabin suspension, while the model was stimulated with the same input function, led to 43 % improvement in RMS acceleration of the transmitted vibrations to the tractor seat.

To test this idea, precocious maturation of the exodermis was induced with a humid air gap inside a hydroponic <b>chamber.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> conductivity (Lppc) was measured on completely submerged roots (with an immature exodermis) and on air-gap-exposed root regions (with two mature exodermal layers) using a pressure chamber.

To evaluate the efficiency of this treatment process, flow and tracer transport analysis {{have been used in}} the literature using Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) and large-eddy simulations (LES). The {{purpose of this study is}} two-fold. First a unifying analysis of the flow field is presented and similarities and differences in the numerical results that were reported in the literature are discussed. Second, the vorticity field is identified as the key parameter to use in separating the mean flow (jet zone) and the recirculating zones. Based on the concepts of vorticity gradient and flexion product, it is demonstrated that the separation of the recirculation zone and the jet zone, fluid-fluid flow separation, is possible. The separation of the recirculation zones and vortex core lines are characterized using the definition of the Lamb vector. The separated regions are used to characterize the mixing efficiency in the chambers of the contact tank. This analysis indicates that the recirculation zone and jet zone formation are three-dimensional and require simulations over a long period of time to reach stability. It is recognized that the characteristics of the jet zones and the recirculation zones are distinct for each chamber and they follow a particular pattern and symmetry between the alternating <b>chambers.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> efficiency coefficients calculated for each chamber show that the chambers having an inlet adjacent to the free surface may be designed to have larger volumes than the chambers having wall bounded inlets to improve the efficiency of the contact tank.

40|$|A piezoelectrically-driven {{hydraulic}} amplification microvalve {{for use in}} high {{specific power}} hydraulic pumping applications was designed, fabricated, and experimentally characterized. High frequency, high force actuation capabilities were enabled through the incorporation {{of one or more}} bulk piezoelectric material elements beneath a micromachined annular tethered-piston structure. An hydraulic amplification mechanism was employed to amplify the limited stroke of this piezoelectrically-driven piston structure to a significantly larger motion (40 - 50 x) of a micromachined valve membrane with attached valve cap. This valve cap was actuated through its stroke to open and close against a fluid orifice. These design features enabled the valve device to simultaneously meet a set of high frequency (1 - 10 kHz), high pressure(0. 1 -IMPa), and large stroke (15 - 40,um) requirements that had not previously been satisfied by other microvalves presented in the literature. This research was carried out through a series of modeling, design, fabrication, assembly, and experimental testing tasks. Linear and non-linear modeling tools characterizing the structural deformations of the active valve sub-systems were developed. These tools enabled accurate prediction of real-time stresses along the micromachined valve membrane structure during deflection into its non-linear large-deflection regime. A systematic design procedure was developed to generate an active valve geometry to satisfy membrane stress limitations and valve power consumption requirements set forth by external hydraulic system performance goals. (cont.) Fabrication challenges, such as deep-reactive ion etching (DRIE) of the drive element and valve membrane structures, wafer-level silicon-to-silicon fusion bonding and silicon-to-glass anodic bonding operations, preparation and integration of piezoelectric material elements within the micromachined tethered piston structure, die-level assembly and bonding of silicon and glass dies, and filling of degassed fluid within the <b>hydraulic</b> amplification <b>chamber</b> were overcome. The active valve structural behavior and flow regulation capabilities were evaluated over a range of applied piezoelectric voltages, actuation frequencies, and differential pressures across the valve. For applied piezoelectric voltages up to 500 Vpp at lkHz, the valve devices demonstrated amplification ratios of drive element deflection to valve cap deflection of 40 - 50 x. These amplification ratios correlated within 5 - 10 % of the model expectations. Flow regulation experiments proved that a peak average flow rate through the device of 0. 21 mL/s under a lkHz sinusoidal drive voltage of 500 Vpp, with valve opening of 17 pm, against a differential pressure of 260 kPa could be obtained. Tests revealed that fluid-structural interactions between the valve cap and membrane components and flow instabilities (due to transition between the laminar and turbulent flow regimes through the valve orifice) limited the valve performance capabilities. by David C.
