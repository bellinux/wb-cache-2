Carbenicillin activity was not significantly altered by incubation with pus. Equal volumes of antibiotic and purulent sediment decreased the effective concentration of polymyxin B, colistin <b>sulfate,</b> or <b>gentamicin</b> from 100 μg/ml to 3 to 6 μg/ml. One milliliter of purulent sediment bound more than 700 μg of gentamicin and 1, 500 μg of polymyxin B or colistin sulfate. This effect occurred rapidly, proceeded at 4 and 37 C, was stable for 24 to 48 h, and was altered, but not abolished, by varying the pH of the solution. Antibiotic activity could be removed from pus by high concentrations of protamine sulfate, heparin, sodium chloride, or potassium chloride, suggesting binding rather than inactivation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{diffusion}} in agar of antibiotics prepared in homogenates of tissue, tissue supernatant fluids, whole serum, and buffer solution. Penicillin, erythromycin, cephalothin, <b>gentamicin,</b> and colistin <b>sulfate</b> were studied. With {{the exception of}} erythromycin in supernatant fluid of human tonsil, zones of inhibition in agar were consistently smaller in homogenate and supernatant fractions of tissue than in serum and buffer. Thus, a significant error of underestimation occurred when a buffer standard curve was used for assaying antimicrobial activity in homogenates of tissue. This error ranged from 23 to 66 % in 10 % guinea pig liver homogenate and from 43 to 78 % in 20 % liver homogenate. A similar, but smaller error of under-estimation resulted with supernatant fractions of tissue except with erythromycin, for which a 25 to 56 % error of overestimation occurred when activity in supernatant fraction of tonsil was read off a buffer standard curve.

40|$|There {{is concern}} that heavy metals and {{biocides}} {{contribute to the}} development of antibiotic resistance via co-selection. Most antifouling paints contain high amounts of such substances, which risks turning painted ship hulls into highly mobile refuges and breeding grounds for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The objectives of this study were to start investigate if heavy-metal based antifouling paints can pose a risk for co-selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and, if so, identify the underlying genetic basis. Plastic panels with one side painted with copper and zinc-containing antifouling paint were submerged in a Swedish marina and biofilms from both sides of the panels were harvested after 2. 5 - 4 weeks. DNA was isolated from the biofilms and subjected to metagenomic sequencing. Biofilm bacteria were cultured on marine agar supplemented with tetracycline, <b>gentamicin,</b> copper <b>sulfate</b> or zinc sulfate. Biofilm communities from painted surfaces displayed lower taxonomic diversity and enrichment of Gammaproteobacteria. Bacteria from these communities showed increased resistance to both heavy metals and tetracycline but not to gentamicin. Significantly higher abundance of metal and biocide resistance genes was observed, whereas mobile antibiotic resistance genes were not enriched in these communities. In contrast, we found an enrichment of chromosomal RND efflux system genes, including such with documented ability to confer decreased susceptibility to both antibiotics and biocides/heavy metals. This was paralleled by increased abundances of integron-associated integrase and ISCR transposase genes. The results show that the heavy metal-based antifouling paint exerts a strong selection pressure on marine bacterial communities and can co-select for certain antibiotic-resistant bacteria, likely by favoring species and strains carrying genes that provide cross-resistance. Although this does not indicate an immediate risk for promotion of mobile antibiotic resistance, the clear increase of genes involved in mobilizing DNA provides a foundation for increased opportunities for gene transfer in such communities, which might also involve yet unknown resistance mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|In {{the case}} of {{external}} ophthalmic infections, repeated instillations of antibiotics are required to reach therapeutic level, above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). An additional administration of a corticosteroid is often needed, in order to limit the precorneal damages caused by the infection.

40|$|Objective. Intravesical {{instillation}} of <b>gentamicin</b> <b>sulfate</b> {{has been}} used empirically as prophylaxis and to treat bacilluria in spinal-cord-injured patients undergoing clean intermittent catheterization. To assess the risks of absorption {{and the effects of}} storage conditions on antimicrobial potency, a series of studies were conducted. Methods. Four studies were carried out: (1) An infected fulgurated rat bladder model was created {{to determine the effects of}} inflammation and infection on absorption. (2) A canine model with bilateral vesicoureteral reflux and elevated bladder pressures (> 40 cmH 2 O) assessed the effects of reflux and storage pressure. (3) The effects in patients with associated conditions including renal transplantation, myelomeningocele, vesicoureteral reflux, and bladder augmentation, were analyzed. (4) To determine the effects of storage conditions, solutions of <b>gentamicin</b> <b>sulfate</b> (480 mg <b>gentamicin</b> <b>sulfate</b> in 1 L 0. 9 % NaCI) were made that controlled for pH, storage temperature, and duration. Results. (1) Increased absorption was found in 43 percent of rat serum samples. (2) None of the dogs demonstrated measurable absorption. (3) None of the patients likewise had measurable absorption. (4) All solutions were equally potent when tested against a panel of common urinary pathogens. Storage up to two months at room temperature without alkalinization had no effect on potency. Conclusions. Instilled intravesical <b>gentamicin</b> <b>sulfate</b> has a low risk of absorption and is highly effective. Severe bladder inflammation can increase transvesical absorption.

40|$|Aim: Owing to the {{widespread}} use of antibiotic drugs in both human and animals, {{we thought it would be}} important to determine the effect of these on lactoperoxidase (LPO; E. C. 1. 11. 1. 7) activity during lactation. The in vitro effects of <b>gentamicin</b> <b>sulfate</b> and ampicillin sodium drugs on bovine LPO enzyme activity in breast-milk were investigated. Materials and Methods: LPO was purified with Amberlite CG 50 resin, CM Sephadex C- 50 ion-exchange chromatography, and Sephadex G- 100 gel filtration chromatography from skimmed bovine milk. Rz(A 412 /A 280) value for the purified LPO was found to be 0. 8. Inhibition or activation effects of the drugs on LPO enzyme were determined using 2, 21 -azino–bis (3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) as a chromogenic substrate at pH = 6. 0. Results: The purified enzyme showed a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). I 50 values of <b>gentamicin</b> <b>sulfate</b> and ampicillin sodium drugs exhibiting inhibition effects were obtained by drawing % Activity- [drugs] graphs. The obtained I 50 values of <b>gentamicin</b> <b>sulfate</b> and ampicillin sodium were 3. 71 mM and 0. 89 mM, respectively. Ki constants of the drugs were found by means of Lineweaver-Burk graphs.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed for analyzing these samples {{in order to}} detect their corrosion properties. In the electrochemical analysis section (GAMRY potentiostat), a corrosion rate of 72 milli inch per year was found for the sample coated with a 12 deionized phosphonic acid (Di-PA) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) and 9 chitosan/carboxymethyl cellulose (CHI/CMC) multilayers. The Mg alloy samples were coated with cationic polyelectrolyte (chitosan) and anionic polyelectrolyte (CMC) using a layer-by-layer (LBL) coating method. Both polymer solutions were 0. 0015 gm. /liter. In the antibacterial test section, gentamicin was investigated for how it would adhere on the Mg substrate surface and {{how it would be}} an antibacterial agent against Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. This experiment involved different sets of samples. From a coating point of view, a bare layer, self-assembly monolayer, polyelectrolyte layer, and combination of self-assembly monolayer and polyelectrolyte layer were analyzed.

Equal amounts of gentamicin and clindamycin sustained the antibacterial effect and prevented regrowth. The most effective release curves of gentamicin and clindamycin found with an in vitro model were used for monitoring release profiles of these antibiotics from impregnated sewing rings by investigating combinations of <b>gentamicin</b> <b>sulfate,</b> gentamicin crobefat, and clindamycin palmitate. Sewing rings impregnated with 4 mg of <b>gentamicin</b> <b>sulfate,</b> 14 mg of gentamicin crobefat, and 20 mg of clindamycin palmitate gave an initial gentamicin burst and afterwards yielded a lower sustained release of gentamicin and clindamycin palmitate.

The release of <b>gentamicin</b> <b>sulfate</b> for a period of five days from the nanoclay-enriched hydrogels would supply anti-microbial agents in a sustained and controlled manner and assist in preventing microbial growth and biofilm formation on the titanium implant surface. A pilot study, using mouse osteoblasts, confirmed that the nanoclay enriched surfaces are also cell supportive as osteoblasts readily, proliferated and produced a type I collagen and proteoglycan matrix...|$|E
40|$|Nanotechnology is a {{promising}} approach both for restoring or enhancing activity {{of old and}} conventional antimicrobial agents and for treating intracellular infections by providing intracellular targeting and sustained release of drug inside infected cells. The present paper introduces a formulation study of gentamicin loaded biodegradable nanoparticles (Nps). Solid-oil-in water technique was studied for <b>gentamicin</b> <b>sulfate</b> nanoencapsulation using uncapped Polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA-H) and Polylactide-co-glycolide-co-Polyethylenglycol (PLGA-PEG) blends. Screening design was applied to optimize: drug payload, Nps size and size distribution, stability and resuspendability after freeze-drying. PLGA-PEG concentration resulted most significant factor influencing particles size and drug content (DC) : 8 w/w% DC and 200 nm Nps were obtained. Stirring rate resulted most influencing factor for size distribution (PDI) : 700 rpm permitted to obtain homogeneous Nps dispersion (PDI = 1). Further experimental parameters investigated, by 23 screening design, were: polymer blend composition (PLGA-PEG and PLGA-H), Polyvinylalcohol (PVA) and methanol concentrations into aqueous phase. Drug content was increased to 10. 5 w/w%. Nanoparticle lyophilization was studied adding cryoprotectants, polyvinypirrolidone K 17 and K 32, and sodiumcarboxymetylcellulose. Freeze-drying protocol was optimized by a mixture design. A freeze-dried Nps powder free resuspendable with stable Nps size and payload, was developed. The powder was tested on clinic bacterial isolates demonstrating that after encapsulation, <b>gentamicin</b> <b>sulfate</b> kept its activity...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{major factor}} {{contributing}} {{to the failure of}} orthopedic and orthodontic implants is post-surgical infection. Coating metallic implant surfaces with anti-microbial agents has shown promise but does not always prevent the formation of bacterial biofilms. Furthermore, breakdown of these coatings within the human body can cause release of the anti-microbial drugs in an uncontrolled or unpredictable fashion. In this study, we used a calcium alginate and calcium phosphate cement (CPC) hydrogel composite as the base material and enriched these hydrogels with the anti-microbial drug, <b>gentamicin</b> <b>sulfate,</b> loaded within a halloysite nanotubes (HNTs). Our results demonstrate a sustained and extended release of gentamicin from hydrogels enriched with the gentamicin-loaded HNTs. When tested against the gram-negative bacteria, the hydrogel/nanoclay composites showed a pronounced zone of inhibition suggesting that anti-microbial doped nanoclay enriched hydrogels can prevent the growth of bacteria.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this study}} we {{evaluated}} gentamicin palmitate salt and <b>gentamicin</b> <b>sulfate</b> salt mixed with bone chips after storage at 80 °C. Different concentration rates of <b>gentamicin</b> <b>sulfate</b> and gentamicin palmitate were mixed with human bone chips and stored for 1 – 6 months at 80 °C. Nonstored samples were used as control. The release of the antibiotics from the bone {{was carried out in}} phosphate-buffered saline. Antibiotic concentrations in the elutions were determined with microbiological agar diffusion assay using Bacillus subtilis. Susceptibility tests were carried out using Staphylococci strains. The rate of gentamicin base (GB) released from bone was similar for all gentamicin salts and all storage conditions. The elutions released were efficient on reducing S. aureus and S. epidermidis CFU during all storage time. In resume, the capacity of bone grafts to act as gentamicin carriers has been confirmed in this study. GSþGP showed equivalent efficacy against S. aureus and S. epidermidis compared with GS pure. The lower delivery rate of GSþGP, related to its affinity with fat tissue can be an advantage for longer release times, increasing the local protection against infections. Storage at 80 °C does not interfere on the gentamicin salts activity used. 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Orthop Re...|$|E
40|$|<b>Gentamicin</b> <b>sulfate</b> or {{neomycin}} sulfate injected intraperitoneally into 24 - to 27 -g mice at {{a dose of}} 6. 2 mg per mouse elicited botulism-like {{responses in}} less than 30 min, but a dose of 3. 1 mg per mouse had no observable effect. The normally nontoxic 3. 1 -mg aminoglycoside dose aggravated the illness induced by an earlier injection of Clostridium botulinum type A or B toxin; it was usually lethal in 2 to 20 min if the preexisting illness was moderate to severe and worsened the condition of mice for about 30 min if the preexisting botulism was mild. The aminoglycoside had no effect when given shortly after the botulinum toxin was injected intraperitoneally; the sensitized state followed a latent period. It rapidly produced botulism-like effects when given to mice which had responded to a mixture of botulinum toxin and another mouse toxic agent with an illness that did not include signs of botulism. An unexpected illness devoid of botulism-like effects was encountered during intestinal colonization of mice by C. botulinum. The appearance of botulism-like signs soon after 3. 1 mg of <b>gentamicin</b> <b>sulfate</b> was injected supported other suggestions that this illness included botulism that was masked by {{the effects of a}} second cause...|$|E
