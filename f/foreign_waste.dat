Contracting out MSW to foreign companies meant that the Zabbaleen would lose access to garbage, which was {{the basis of their}} recycling and sorting activities. In the documentary Garbage Dreams, Laila, a social worker in Mokattam Village, says, [...] "The city contracted with <b>foreign</b> <b>waste</b> disposal companies because they perceived the Zabbaleen to be old-fashioned. But they didn't come tell us, [...] "You need to modernize your ways." [...] This was all done behind our backs. [...] "we're replacing you with the companies." [...] So we can be like the developed countries." [...] In contrast, because officials from the Cairo Cleaning and Beautification Authority (CCBA) regarded the Zabbaleen recycling methods as unhygienic and backwards, they were optimistic about the process and hoped for a positive impact on Cairo's environment. However, because the mechanized equipment of the foreign companies are too large for the streets of Cairo, citizens were required to bring their trash to designated collection centers and bins, which were not always placed in easily accessible locations. Therefore, residents preferred to continue to have their trash picked up from their doors by the Zabbaleen, who were able to come directly to their doors even if their homes were located in narrow alleys. Eventually, the foreign companies realized that they needed the Zabbaleen and thus, subcontracted them. This system failed, however, because the companies underpaid the Zabbaleen. According to Fahmi and Sutton, [...] "while company sources mention salaries ranging between LE 300 to LE 450 per month (US $50–$75), some Zabbaleen claim that the salaries on offer are actually closer to LE 150 per month." [...] One Zabbal with eight children gave a similar figure: whereas he used to make LE 10 a day (US $1.60), foreign contractors offered him LE 5 a day.|$|E
5000|$|As an attorney, Lee also {{represented}} Class A low-level radioactive waste facility provider EnergySolutions Inc. {{in a highly}} publicized dispute between {{the company and the}} Utah public and public officials that caused controversy during his Senate election. Utah's government had allowed the company to store radioactive waste in the state so long as it was low-grade [...] "Class A" [...] material. When the company arranged to store waste from Italy, many objected to the waste being foreign and that it could potentially be more radioactive than permitted. Lee argued that the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution allowed the company to accept <b>foreign</b> <b>waste</b> and that the waste could be reduced in grade by mixing it with lower grade materials, while the government of Utah sought to ban the importation of <b>foreign</b> <b>waste</b> using an interstate radioactive waste compact. EnergySolutions eventually abandoned its plans to store Italian radioactive waste in Utah, ending the dispute, with the 10th U.S. Circuit court later ruling that the compact had the power to block foreign radioactive waste from being stored in Utah.|$|E

The waste trade is a highly risky activity, associated strongly with environmental damage, market failures, and issues of equity and social justice, the predominant theme {{in the literature on}} the trade so far. The movement of wastes across national frontiers is agency-driven: deliberate decisions are made by waste disposal firms to accept <b>foreign</b> <b>wastes</b> for disposal, and by the government agencies which issue waste importation permits or otherwise allow hazardous wastes to enter the country. At the same time, waste importation, along with many other issues concerning hazardous waste management, is often strongly opposed by a wide range of forces, usually including environmental groups and the weight of public opinion...|$|R

30|$|Another {{important}} {{application of}} MU-hLCA is in studying circular economy that promotes the sustainable concept of make-use-reuse-recycle (Stahel 2016; Weisz et al. 2015), as it enables the modelling of life cycle emissions when virgin materials are substituted by recycled materials in an economy-wide scale. Circular economy can bring substantial {{benefits from the}} environmental, social, and economic points of view, where employment, welfare and gross domestic product could be enhanced (Breene 2016; McKinsey and Company 2016). China has recently decided to disallow imports of <b>foreign</b> <b>waste</b> from countries including Australia (Lasker et al. 2017). To overcome the negative implications of this new policy and to reduce reliance on external providers of waste management services, Australia needs to harness the benefits of reusing and recycling, and reinvigorate local recycling initiatives and transition to a circular economy. MU-hLCA contributes towards the efforts of quantifying the environmental benefits of recycled materials, and can potentially analyse the socioeconomic benefits as well, provided suitable satellite data are available.|$|E
30|$|The park {{administration}} {{does not have}} enough resources to monitor the activities of the tourists or the residents, and it is not able to provide infrastructure improvements to the residents. Therefore, the park gains from the support of the community in monitoring, self-control and nature conservation. The community observes the tourists, and if they ‘see people doing the wrong things’ (AMOMAR Member 3), they report them to the park administration, the park guards, the police or the monitors. This process preserves nature beyond just the impact of the residents and the tourists. For example, the residents clean the beach of <b>foreign</b> <b>waste</b> that washes ashore from large ocean tankers. The park administrators appreciate this behavior. ‘I know some parks that do not have a community and they put two park guards there to look after it, but everybody succeeds in entering the park, making a mess there and devastating the park.

40|$|Studies {{over the}} last two decades have shown that {{mammalian}} nonmacrophagic liver endothelial cells clear the blood from numerous physiological and <b>foreign</b> <b>waste</b> macromolecules, such as polysaccharides and proteins released during extracellular matrix turnover, intracellular macromolecules, modified serum proteins, and bacterial and fungal proteins [Smedsrød, B., Pertoft, H., Gustafson, S. & Laurent, T. C. (1990) Biochem. J. 266, 313 – 327]. These macromolecules are released daily in gram-amounts in a normal human body and are effectively taken up and degraded by the liver endothelial cells. Recent studies show that bony fishes harbor a similar system of specialized nonmacrophagic scavenger endothelial cells in either kidney [Smedsrød, B., Gjøen, T., Sveinbjørnsson, B. & Berg, T.

Using specific and extremely effective endocytosis, these fish scavenger endothelial cells function as their mammalian counterpart to eliminate soluble waste macromolecules from the circulation. We show here that species from all seven vertebrate classes carry a population of nonmacrophagic scavenger endothelial cells that efficiently eliminate an array of circulating waste macromolecules. Thus representing an important part of the vertebrate innate immune system, these scavenger endothelial cells display the following distribution in the different vertebrate classes: Gills in Agnatha and Chondrichtyes; heart or kidney in Osteichtyes; and liver in Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} the Great American Desert of the pre-Civil War era {{ceased to be}} a desert and how the modern American desert became American. The project begins after the Louisiana Purchase {{with the advent of the}} Great American Desert, the historical geography that framed the Great Plains as an American Sahara and thus as a foreign land unfit for agricultural occupation. Modern historians and historical geographers have largely dismissed the Great American Desert as a geographic myth. This work takes a different approach. One of the central contentions here is that it is impossible to know precisely what nineteenth-century Americans meant when they used the word desert because they used the word desert in a variety of ways that do not conform to modern usage. Sometimes they used it reference to arid landscapes; other times they used it—without climatic specificity—to describe any tract of land deemed <b>foreign,</b> barren, <b>waste,</b> or unreclaimed (including forests and wetlands). All of which explains why roughly half of the conterminous United States—the Great Plains, eastern California, Oregon, and Washington, and much of everything in between—has, at time or another, been mapped or described as desert. An environmental and cultural history of US territorial exploration and expansion from Lewis and Clark to the operations of the U. S. Geological Survey at the end of the nineteenth century, the larger arc of the study plots how the old territorial regime of desert as foreign wasteland eventually gave way, or at least came to coincide, with a new territorial regime—a territorial regime that not only framed deserts as arid lands, but converted deserts from foreign into domestic territory through expressions of affection for the desert West. The principal aim here is not develop an operative definition of the word desert, or determine whether or not nineteenth-century Americans actually believed the Great Plains were comparable to the Great Desert of North Africa, but rather to track changes in the socio-cultural meaning of deserts in American territorial discourse and how those changes in meaning informed the larger project of American continentalism...|$|R

It is the fact of travel [...] whether as a tourist, an immigrant or a refugee [...] that makes the disruption of toilet habits possible. The moment of cultural defamiliarization occurs when the body is placed {{in a situation of}} difference where "Chineseness" and all the cultural practices associated with being Chinese are placed into question. The threatened loss of meaning in the confrontation with <b>foreign</b> technologies of <b>waste</b> may be complicated by considering Julia Kristeva's concept of "abjection": the reaction to the loss of the distinction between subject and object or between self and other. The loss of control over the disposal of personal waste, the confrontation with one's own materiality as a body, are heightened in the situation of travel or of geographical dislocation. Abjection can clarify the role of toilets in Chinese diasporic cultural production on two levels: the cultural level where culture is revealed as separate from the "pre-cultural" and specific cultures are revealed in all their specificity; second, the individual level where abjection names the moment of separation from the mother/motherland, when we begin to recognize a boundary between "me" and other, between "me" and "(m) other. ...|$|R

40|$|The article reviews {{existing}} global {{concept in}} the field of waste production and consumption. The  purpose  of this investigation is {{the development of a new}} hierarchy of waste mana-gement and adjustment of the existing waste management strategy, acceptable to Russia. To analyze the current situation of waste production and consumption there was studied <b>foreign</b> experience in <b>waste</b> management and considered the situation of waste in the Russian Federation and Sverdlovsk region. Analytical, statistical and theoretical methods of work were used. The new hierarchy of desirable waste management is based on the following order: selective collection of waste, particularly household, their recycling and thereby minimize them, and then their treatment and further disposal. This new hierarchy will significantly reduce the burden on the environment and land resources. The revised strategy for solid waste management should consist of 6 blocks, ranked in a logical sequence: organizational, legal, science and research, economic, controlling, educational. Each of them includes a list of activities. Term strategy implementation is 5 years, followed by a possible prolongation. To improve the efficiency of work {{in the field}} of solid waste management in Russia must be created a new waste recycling industry, which can be provided by necessary infrastructure for the collection, transportation, recycling and disposal of solid waste products. It is also required to monitor environmental pollution waste using geographic information systems and provide educational work among population and the leaders of the industrial and communal enterprises. In the article in addition to the world concept the authors took into account an economic component, which includes analysis of the costs of environmental protection measures and economic damage caused by waste disposal. The paper also provides an industry deformed structure of the Russian economy, which explains the inability to provide optimal environmental costs and reduce the economic costs of the ever-growing volume of waste solid products. According with the economic laws the authors determined the amount of state financing of a new waste recycling industry. The amount of which is about 1 % of GDP. These money can be directed to the creation and funding of waste recycling industry, which in the future may become profitable. The results of this investigation are necessary for adjustment and improvement the mana-gement in Russia in order to improve the environmental and national security of the country. </p...|$|R
60|$|The famous set of {{pictures}} called “Marriage à la Mode”, {{and which are}} exhibited at Marlborough House [1853], in London, contains {{the most important and}} highly wrought of the Hogarth comedies. The care and method with which the moral grounds of these pictures are laid is as remarkable as the wit and skill of the observing and dexterous artist. He has to describe the negotiations for a marriage pending between the daughter of a rich citizen Alderman and young Lord Viscount Squanderfield, the dissipated son of a gouty old earl. Pride and pomposity appear in every accessory surrounding the earl. He sits in gold lace and velvet—as how should such an earl wear anything but velvet and gold lace? His coronet is everywhere: on his footstool on which reposes one gouty toe turned out; on the sconces and looking-glasses; on the dogs; on his lordship’s very crutches; on his great chair of state and the great baldaquin behind him; under which he sits pointing majestically to his pedigree, which shows that his race is sprung from the loins of William the Conqueror, and confronting the old alderman from the City, who has mounted his sword for the occasion, and wears his alderman’s chain, and has brought a bag full of money, mortgage-deeds, and thousand-pound notes, for the arrangement of the transaction pending between them. Whilst the steward (a Methodist, therefore a hypocrite and cheat, for Hogarth scorned a Papist and a Dissenter) is negotiating between the old couple, their children sit together, united but apart. My lord is admiring his countenance in the glass, while his bride is twiddling her marriage ring on her pocket-handkerchief; and listening with rueful countenance to Counsellor Silvertongue, who has been drawing the settlements. The girl is pretty, but the painter, with a curious watchfulness, has taken care to give her a likeness to her father, as in the young viscount’s face you see a resemblance to the earl, his noble sire. The sense of the coronet pervades the picture, as it is supposed to do the mind of its wearer. The pictures round the room are sly hints indicating the situation of the parties about to marry. A martyr is led to the fire; Andromeda is offered to sacrifice; Judith is going to slay Holofernes. There is the ancestor of the house (in the picture it is the earl himself as a young man), with a comet over his head, indicating that the career of the family is to be brilliant and brief. In the second picture, the old lord must be dead, for madam has now the countess’s coronet over her bed and toilet-glass, and sits listening to that dangerous Counsellor Silvertongue, whose portrait now actually hangs up in her room, whilst the counsellor takes his ease on the sofa by her side, evidently the familiar of the house, and the confidant of the mistress. My lord takes his pleasure elsewhere than at home, whither he returns jaded and tipsy from the “Rose”, to find his wife yawning in her drawing-room, her whist-party over, and the daylight streaming in; or he amuses himself with the very worst company abroad, whilst his wife sits at home listening to <b>foreign</b> singers, or <b>wastes</b> her money at auctions, or, worse still, seeks amusement at masquerades. The dismal end is known. My lord draws upon the counsellor, who kills him, and is apprehended whilst endeavouring to escape. My lady goes back perforce to the alderman in the City, and faints upon reading Counsellor Silvertongue’s dying speech at Tyburn, where the counsellor has been executed for sending his lordship out of the world. Moral:—Don’t listen to evil silver-tongued counsellors: don’t marry a man for his rank, or a woman for her money: don’t frequent foolish auctions and masquerade balls unknown to your husband: don’t have wicked companions abroad and neglect your wife, otherwise you will be run through the body, and ruin will ensue, and disgrace, and Tyburn. The people are all naughty, and Bogey carries them all off.|$|R
