In normal individuals who are fed thy-roid there is a similar increase in calcium and phosphorus excretion, and in myxedema there is a diminished excretion which rises toward normal following thyroid therapy.

40|$|Although the {{pathogenesis}} of endocrine disorders has only recently been recognized, disorders of the thyroid gland have been recorded since ancient times, {{primarily because of the}} gland’s strategic location in the neck. Goiter, enlargement of the gland, was described early in history and endocrine goiter was also mentioned. The earliest written references go back as far as the Chinese of the second millennium BC, Greek and Roman authors of classical times, and medieval manuscripts. In his history of goiter, Greenwald contended that {{there was no evidence of}} goiter in the Americas before the coming of the white man, although the protruding eyes of possible <b>exophthalmic</b> <b>goiter</b> are seen in Peruvian ceramic sculpture from 2000 years ago...|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to study the {{relation}} of magnesium to other inorganic salt metabolism, three diseases other than hyperparathyroidism come to mind. The thyroid gland {{has been shown to}} exert an enormous influence on calcium metabolism, and in <b>exophthalmic</b> <b>goiter,</b> even though the blood calcium level is normal, there is the largest calcium excretion found in any disease (1). In steatorrhea is found a very high fecal calcium excretion and often, as a result of deficient calcium absorption, a low blood calcium level with resultant tetany (2, 3, 4). Obviously, it is of interest to study the magnesium excretion in these two diseases. Addison's disease represents a different problem. It has been shown by Loeb (5) and b...|$|E
40|$|Patients with toxic nodular goiter {{present an}} {{increased}} urinary excretion of iodine. This {{is greater than}} that observed in patients with exoph-thalmic goiter (1). The blood iodine and the basal metabolic rate are also increased, but {{to a lesser degree}} than in <b>exophthalmic</b> <b>goiter</b> (1). In non-toxic nodular goiter, however, the urinary excretion of iodine, the blood iodine, and the basal metabolic rate are normal or may be even decreased (3). More recently we have found that the iodine metabolism of <b>exophthalmic</b> <b>goiter</b> is greatly aug-mented (2). This is shown in the elevated blood iodine, the increased excretion of iodine through one or all excretory channels, and the increased negative iodine balance on a low iodine intake. It consequently appeared desirable to extend bal-ance studies to patients with nodular goiter, in order better to compare the iodine metabolism in these three thyroid diseases. We have therefore determined the iodine balance of two patients with non-toxic nodular goiter over a total period of 36 days and that of two patients with toxic nodular goiter over a total period of 54 days. METHODS Our experimental and laboratory methods have been given (2, 4, 5). A constant regimen of hospital management was begun five to six days prior to investigation and then maintained throughout the period of study. The daily diets were selected from a limited number of foods. They were low in iodine and calcium content, ade-quate in other respects, and as attractive as pos-sible. They were constant for each individual during the preoperative period. The iodine con-tent of the food as actually served to each patient was determined (2) ...|$|E

40|$|A PRELIMINARY {{report on}} the use of thiouracil in the {{preoperative}} man-agement of 12 toxic hyperthyroid patients at the Lahey Clinic was published in May 1944. 1 We were convinced of the effectiveness of this drug and since then we have continued to use thiouracil as a preoperative therapeutic agent in a total of 64 patients. The patients treated were severely toxic and would have incurred more than the average surgical risk if they had been prepared in the usual manner by administration of Lugol's solution. Most of these patients would have required multiple stage operations, but with thiouracil most went through a subtotal thyroidectomy safely and with no reaction. Our observations on this group were as follows. There were 51 females and 13 males with both types of hyperthyroidism— 50 patients had primary hyperthyroidism or <b>exophthalmic</b> <b>goiter</b> and 14 patients had adenomatous goiter with hyperthyroidism. The ages varied from 11 years (a girl with severe, <b>exophthalmic</b> <b>goiter)</b> to 72 years. The average age was 43 years; 27 patients were over 50 years of age. The duration of the hyperthyroidism ranged from three months to 15 years. Twenty-nine patients had had the disease for over two years; of these, 15 had been ill more than four years. The average weight loss of the group was 29 pounds, with a loss of as much as 98 pounds in one case. The initial basal metabolic rate varied from + 21 per cent to + 9 8 per cent, the average rate being + 5 1 per cent. These patients were all considered to have severe hyperthyroidism because of their being in the older age group, because they had had the disease {{for a long time and}} had high basal metabolic rates. Fifteen patients with adenomatous goiter were classified as thyrocardiacs, having either heart failure or auricular fibrillation without heart failure. PLAN OF TREATMENT Our early experience quickly taught us that when thiouracil f is used the maximum improvement must be strived for; in other words, patients should not be sent to operation until a normal or nearly normal basal meta-bolic rate is recorded. The objection to partial control is illustrated by two patients (figures 1 and 2) who were sent for operation, the first patient afte...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we intend to}} survey the {{association}} between mortality {{from a group of}} metabolic diseases, and certain climatic and socio-eco-nomic factors in the United States Registration Area for the period from 1921 to 1930 inclusive. The diseases selected for study were diabetes mellitus, <b>exophthalmic</b> <b>goiter,</b> Addison's disease, leukemia and pernicious anemia. The original interest in this study was stimulated by a desire to analyze more closely the statistical situation which has permitted re-cent investigators to conclude that climatic factors are responsible for a major portion of the geographical variability in mortality from such metabolic diseases. In their studies a particular emphasis has been put upon diabetes in view, no doubt, of the conspicuous position of this disease among metabolic disorders and its apparently increasing im-portance as a cause of death. We have not restricted a re-examination of this question to climatic factors. The obvious gross association between climate and socio-economic status in the United States, and the recognized bearing of the latter on health and on accurate reporting of vital statistics casts serious doubt on studies of disease and climate which do not consider social and economic factors...|$|E
40|$|Thyroidectomy hastens, while gonadectomy delays, {{but does}} not {{permanently}} prevent, involution of the thymus. Suprarenalectomy alone not only delays involution of the thymus and lymphoid tissue but may cause their regeneration. Thyroidectomy prevents this reaction even after combined suprarenalectomy and gonadectomy. Suprarenalectomy plus gonadectomy is a more powerful stimulus for thymus and lymphoid regeneration than either of these influences alone. The combined effect of these two factors results in certain lymphoid and thymus hyperplasia in rabbits which persists until regeneration of accessory interrenal tissue corrects the physiological defect. The syndrome thus experimentally produced resembles status lymphaticus and is believed to depend mainly on a partial loss of certain functions of the interrenal and sex glands rather than of the chromaffin tissue. The normal and abnormal lymphoid and thymic hyperplasias of infancy and childhood {{are believed to be}} manifestations of a functional underdevelopment of the interrenal and sex glands of varying intensity. The so called lymphatic constitution which underlies or accompanies <b>exophthalmic</b> <b>goiter,</b> Addison's disease, and acromegaly also appears to be dependent on a partial suppression of certain functions of the interrenal and sex glands...|$|E

40|$|IF one may {{judge from}} the litera-ture ophthalmoplegia {{as a sign}} of Graves ' disease is {{extremely}} rare. Yet other eye signs as exophthalmos, lack of coordination between the move-ments of the upper lid and the eleva-tion or depression of the visual axis and many others are well recognized and constitute some of the cardinal signs of <b>exophthalmic</b> <b>goiter.</b> Heuer (i) in 1916 reviewed the literature of the disturbance in function of the cra-nial nerves associated with exoph-thalmic goiter and reported a case of external ophthalmoplegia with Graves' disease. He pointed out how infre-quently it occurred but that the ocular muscles were the most frequently in-volved of the cranial nerves. He dis-cussed the possible mechanism of the development of the phenomenon but arrived at no definite conclusion. Holloway, Fry and Wentworth (2) recently studied in detail the ocular signs in one hundred unselected cases of goiter and mention that in two cases of goiter they observed paresis of the superior oblique muscles. Because a complete ophthalmoplegia externa preceded other clinical signs and symptoms of a typical Graves' disease syndrome by months, the fol-lowing case is reported: CASE REPORT W.

40|$|Thyrotoxicosis {{is almost}} {{invariably}} {{associated with a}} certain degree of cardiovascular disturbance. Tachycardia is always one of the first signs of this malady. Demonstrable enlargement of the heart fre-quently follows. Cardiac arrhythmia, especially auricular fibrillation, and congestive heart failure often constitute the important part of the clinical picture during the later part of the course of the disease. Occasionally the patient's death may be directly attributable to car-diac insufficiency. Although various views have been put forward, the cause and nature of these circulatory derangements remain in-completely understood. Attempts to find characteristic histological changes in the myocardium have been without success. The isolated reports of damage to the heart muscle (1) (2) (3) (4) give no convincing evidence that the lesion was specific. That the thyroid heart is not a permanent condition has been recently emphasized by Thomas (5). One of the patients reported by this author died from heart failure, but presented no significant myocardial damage on postmortem examina-tion. On the other hand investigations into the physiological pathol-ogy of the disease have been less disappointing. Years ago Plesch (6) demonstrated an increased minute volume in the patients suffering from <b>exophthalmic</b> <b>goiter.</b> Stewart (7) by his special technic found in Graves ' disease an exceptionally large blood flow in the hands and this he thought was in agreement with the flushing of the skin which is commonly seen. More recently the cardiac output in hyper-thyroidism has aroused a renewed interest (8) (9) (10) (11) (12). In spite of the widely different methods employed, all investigators with the single exception of Rabinowitch and Bazin (9) have come to the same conclusion as that reached by Plesch. Blumgart, Gargill and Gilligan (13) studied 13 thyrotoxic patients and showed that th...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} {{publications of}} this series (1, 2), it has been demonstrated that <b>exophthalmic</b> <b>goiter</b> {{is associated with a}} calcium and phosphorus excretion elevated in excess of the increased general metabolism. Several conditions have a high urinary calcium excretion. As far as is now known, such a high calcium output when elevated in both urine and feces is found only in hyperthyroidism and vitamine D deficiencies (3). A patient with osteomalacia, carefully studied by Gargill, Gilligan, and Blumgart (4), showed an analogous high urinary and fecal calcium excretion, which returned to normal after large doses of vitamine D. It was, therefore, of interest to determine whether hyperthyroid cases, because of the elevated metabolic demand, could be suffering from vitamine D deficien-cies due to an increased need for vitamines. The idea gains some support in the work of Plimmer (5) of Cowgill and Klotz (6) and of Himwich, Goldfarb and Cowgill (7), which indicates that the amount of vitamine B required by the organism is determined chiefly by its caloric requirement. In hyperthyroidism the publications of McCarrison (8) have directed attention to the relation of diet and hyperthyroidism, and Rabinowitch (9) and Fraser and Cameron (10) have published observations which suggested that the addition of vitamines A and D to iodine gave a some-what greater improvement in Grave's disease, than did iodine alone. In the following observations, this problem was studied by giving ir-radiated ergosterol to hyperthyroid patients who were maintained on an otherwise constant regime. METHODS The same careful metabolic routine fully described in previous pub-lications (11), was followed. Further descriptions of this technic need not be added here. The diet was essentially neutral in its acid-base contents as calculated from Sherman's tables (12). The constituents were similar to those of Table VII in paper XI {{of this series}} (13), though the total amounts were increased to conform with the caloric needs o...|$|E
