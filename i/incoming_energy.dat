5|$|Climate models use {{quantitative}} methods {{to simulate the}} interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface and ice. They are used {{for a variety of}} purposes; from the study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system, to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, <b>incoming</b> <b>energy</b> as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.|$|E
25|$|NIF is also {{exploring}} {{new types}} of targets. Previous experiments generally used plastic ablators, typically polystyrene (CH). NIF's targets also are constructed by coating a plastic form {{with a layer of}} sputtered beryllium or beryllium-copper alloys, and then oxidizing the plastic out of the center. In comparison to traditional plastic targets, beryllium targets offer higher overall implosion efficiencies for the indirect-drive mode where the <b>incoming</b> <b>energy</b> {{is in the form of}} x-rays.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{feedback}} is a stabilising mechanism acting to oppose changes to coastal morphology and establish equilibrium. A coastal environment in equilibrium {{is able to}} dissipate or reflect <b>incoming</b> <b>energy</b> without the occurrence of sediment input or output and change to morphology. For example; when a beach in equilibrium erodes during a storm it forms an offshore bar that in turn forces waves to break over it. By doing this the waves {{lose a lot of}} energy and dissipate before reaching the shoreline, significantly reducing further erosion. When the storm calms, the bar is then re-worked back on to the beach.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} natural and {{man-made}} mechanisms can affect the global energy balance and force changes in Earth's climate. Greenhouse gases are one such mechanism. Greenhouse gases absorb and emit some of the outgoing energy radiated from Earth's surface, causing that heat to be retained in the lower atmosphere. As explained above, some greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries, and therefore can affect Earth's energy balance over a long period. Radiative forcing quantifies the effect of factors that influence Earth's energy balance, including changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases. Positive radiative forcing leads to warming by increasing the net <b>incoming</b> <b>energy,</b> whereas negative radiative forcing leads to cooling.|$|E
2500|$|A {{problem with}} solar cells {{is that the}} high energy photons that hit the surface are {{converted}} to heat. [...] This is a loss for the cell because the incoming photons are not converted into usable energy. [...] The idea behind the hot carrier cell is to utilize some of that <b>incoming</b> <b>energy</b> which is converted to heat. [...] If the electrons and holes can be collected while hot, a higher voltage {{can be obtained from}} the cell. [...] The problem with doing this is that the contacts which collect the electrons and holes will cool the material. [...] Thus far, keeping the contacts from cooling the cell has been theoretical. [...] Another way of improving the efficiency of the solar cell using the heat generated is to have a cell which allows lower energy photons to excite electron and hole pairs. [...] This requires a small bandgap. [...] Using a selective contact, the lower energy electrons and holes can be collected while allowing the higher energy ones to continue moving through the cell. [...] The selective contacts are made using a double barrier resonant tunneling structure. [...] The carriers are cooled which they scatter with phonons. [...] If a material with a large bandgap of phonons then the carriers will carry more of the heat to the contact and it won't be lost in the lattice structure. [...] One material which has a large bandgap of phonons is indium nitride. [...] The hot carrier cells are in their infancy but are beginning to move toward the experimental stage.|$|E
