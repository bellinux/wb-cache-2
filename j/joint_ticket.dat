25|$|As {{a reward}} for his loyal services, Gaius Marius ran with Aquillius under a <b>joint</b> <b>ticket</b> for the consulship of 101 BC. After the consulship, with Rome {{struggling}} with famine caused by the slave revolt on Sicily, Aquillius was sent to put it down. Aquilius completely subdued Salvius and his insurgents and got an ovation in Rome in 100 BC. In 98 BC, Aquillius was accused by Lucius Fufius of maladministration in Sicily. In the trial he was defended by Marcus Antonius, Consul in 99 BC, and {{even if there were}} strong proofs of his guilt, he was acquitted because of his bravery in the war.|$|E

Southwest recently built a <b>joint</b> <b>ticket</b> counter lobby for the D and E terminals, one large security check point for the two terminals and additional concessions. A hammerhead expansion to the E concourse was finished in February 2010. However, Southwest subsequently ended nonstop service to PHL from most of its non-focus cities due to competition with US Airways. The January 2013 lease extension obtained by US Airways was contingent on a number of future enhancements, and the lease renewal provided some funding.|$|E

Michigan has two official Governor's Residences; one is in Lansing, {{and the other is}} at Mackinac Island. The other constitutionally elected executive officers are the lieutenant governor, who is elected on a <b>joint</b> <b>ticket</b> with the governor, the secretary of state, and the attorney general. The lieutenant governor presides over the Senate, but only voting when ties occur, and {{is also a member of}} the cabinet.

2500|$|Seeking {{re-election}} at the 2003 convention {{at which}} Jack Layton was elected party leader, Giambrone faced a strong challenge from respected [...] New Brunswick NDP leader Elizabeth Weir.

Many delegates balked, especially at the assumption that they could push through a sudden constitutional change in a party often dearly concerned with internal process. The <b>joint</b> <b>ticket</b> was withdrawn, and Giambrone won a second term against Weir and a challenger from the NDP Socialist Caucus.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, the {{severing}} of {{the link}} between NET and Nottingham City Transport, which affected <b>joint</b> <b>ticketing</b> arrangements, may have contributed to a fall in passenger numbers on phase one.

2500|$|Nevertheless, in 2010 he {{declared}} himself {{a candidate for}} the post of deputy leader under the new system, losing to the incumbent Adrian Ramsay. During his Deputy Leader campaign, Wall continued to promote the view that a [...] "right" [...] wing of the Green party is attempting to subvert its democracy, agreeing that [...] "talk of 'modernising' the Green Party [...] actually code for changing inner Party democracy and changing the politics of the Party". Nevertheless, Wall's opponents, the <b>joint</b> <b>ticket</b> of Adrian Ramsay and Caroline Lucas, continue to promote both reform of the party and a left-leaning politics.

2500|$|In February 2004, Schröder {{resigned}} {{as chairman of}} the SPD amid growing criticism from across his own party of his reform agenda; Franz Müntefering succeeded him as chairman. On 22 May 2005, after the SPD lost to the Christian Democrats (CDU) in North Rhine-Westphalia, Gerhard Schröder announced he would call federal elections [...] "as soon as possible". A motion of confidence was subsequently defeated in the Bundestag on 1 July 2005 by 151 to 296 (with 148 abstaining), after Schröder urged members not to vote for his government in order to trigger new elections. In response, a grouping of leftwing SPD dissidents and the neo-communist Party of Democratic Socialism agreed to run on a <b>joint</b> <b>ticket</b> in the general election, with Schröder’s rival Oskar Lafontaine leading the new group.|$|E

In those states, {{the winners of the}} governor primaries and the winners of the lieutenant governor primaries run together as <b>joint</b> <b>tickets</b> in the general election. The governor and lieutenant governor would therefore be from the same party, but may not necessarily be political allies.

2500|$|Corporation {{tickets were}} issued on the Company’s trams between the Nottingham {{terminus}} on Parliament Street and Cinderhill, rebooking being necessary at the latter point on journeys either way. The Company issued a special colliers' ld. ticket, available to colliers going {{to and from}} work in their [...] "pit clothes", irrespective of distance. One passenger answering to this description boarded a Company car on Alpine Street and asked for his ld. ticket, wanting to go to Nuthall. This placed the conductor in a quandary as he had no corresponding ticket for the Corporation, but being an obliging person, he issued a ld. <b>joint</b> <b>ticket</b> which was marked [...] "Parcel or Perambulator"! The said passenger was most insulted by this and informed the conductor so in language not too polite. When the conductor said that he could not do anything about it, the passenger's ire was so roused that he punched the conductor on the nose. Litigation ensued.|$|E
2500|$|Any {{illusion}} that the 1986 election may have created about Mahathir's political dominance was short-lived. In 1987, he was challenged {{for the presidency}} of UMNO, and effectively the prime ministership, by Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. Razaleigh's career had gone backwards under Mahathir, being demoted from the Ministry of Finance to the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Razaleigh was supported by Musa, who had resigned as Deputy Prime Minister the previous year. While Musa and Mahathir were originally close allies, the two had fallen out during Mahathir's premiership, with Musa claiming that Mahathir no longer trusted him. Razaleigh and Musa ran for the UMNO presidency and deputy presidency on a <b>joint</b> <b>ticket</b> against Mahathir and his new choice for deputy, Ghafar Baba. The tickets were known as Team B and Team A respectively. Mahathir's Team A enjoyed {{the support of the}} press, most party heavyweights, and even Iskandar, now the Agong, although some significant figures, such as Abdullah Badawi, supported Team B. In the election, held on 24 April 1987, Team A prevailed. Mahathir was re-elected a by a narrow margin, receiving the votes of 761 party delegates to Razaleigh's 718. Ghafar defeated Musa by a slightly larger margin. Mahathir responded by purging seven Team B supporters from his ministry, while Team B refused to accept defeat and initiated litigation. In an unexpected decision in February 1988, the High Court ruled that UMNO was an illegal organisation as some of its branches had not been lawfully registered. Each faction raced to register a new party under the UMNO name. Mahathir's side successfully registered the name [...] "UMNO Baru" [...] ("new UMNO"), while Team B's application to register [...] "UMNO Malaysia" [...] was rejected. UMNO Malaysia, under the leadership of Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah and with the support of both of Malaysia's surviving former Prime Ministers Abdul Rahman and Hussein, registered the party Semangat 46 instead.|$|E
60|$|We {{should be}} {{advancing}} too rapidly into {{this portion of}} our story were we to concern ourselves deeply at the present moment with the feud as it raged before the evening came round, {{but it may be}} right to indicate that the desire for tickets at last became a burning passion, and a passion which in the great majority of cases could not be indulged. The value of the privilege was so great that Madame Melmotte thought that she was doing almost more than friendship called for when she informed her guest, Miss Longestaffe, that unfortunately there would be no seat for her at the dinner-table; but that, as payment for her loss, she should receive an evening ticket for herself and a <b>joint</b> <b>ticket</b> for a gentleman and his wife.
