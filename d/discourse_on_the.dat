5|$|During the Enlightenment, {{intellectual}} {{sympathy for}} astrology fell away, {{leaving only a}} popular following supported by cheap almanacs. One English almanac compiler, Richard Saunders, followed {{the spirit of the}} age by printing a derisive <b>Discourse</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Invalidity of Astrology, while in France Pierre Bayle's Dictionnaire of 1697 stated that the subject was puerile. The Anglo-Irish satirist Jonathan Swift ridiculed the Whig political astrologer John Partridge.|$|E
5|$|Ian McCormick diagnoses the {{pamphlet}} as representing a gradual change in European <b>discourse</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{character of the}} sodomite: previous publications had discussed sexual deviance (conceived in contemporary terms) as a general evil; with Satan's Harvest Home a new attention {{was brought to the}} individual character of persons who committed sodomy. He argues that 'before the seventeenth century, sodomy was not even precisely differentiated from its demonic associations with werewolves, heretics, sorcerers, and the like. Increasingly, however, it came to be linked with pride, excess of diet, idleness, and contempt of the poor.' The pamphlet's equation of effeminacy with homosexuality is identified by Michael Kimmel as distinctive for the period.|$|E
5|$|As the {{inception}} of the United Nations as an intergovernmental entity slowly began formalizing in 1944, delegates from 44 of its early member states met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, now commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods conference. Delegates remained cognizant {{of the effects of the}} Great Depression, struggles to sustain the international gold standard during the 1930s, and related market instabilities. Whereas previous <b>discourse</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> international monetary system focused on fixed versus floating exchange rates, Bretton Woods delegates favored pegged exchange rates for their flexibility. Under this system, nations would peg their exchange rates to the U.S. dollar, which would be convertible to gold at $35 USD per ounce. This arrangement is commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods system. Rather than maintaining fixed rates, nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar and allow their exchange rates to fluctuate within a 1% band of the agreed-upon parity. To meet this requirement, central banks would intervene via sales or purchases of their currencies against the dollar. Members could adjust their pegs in response to long-run fundamental disequillibria in the balance of payments, but were responsible for correcting imbalances via fiscal and monetary policy tools before resorting to repegging strategies. The adjustable pegging enabled greater exchange rate stability for commercial and financial transactions which fostered unprecedented growth in international trade and foreign investment. This feature grew from delegates' experiences in the 1930s when excessively volatile exchange rates and the reactive protectionist exchange controls that followed proved destructive to trade and prolonged the deflationary effects of the Great Depression. Capital mobility faced de facto limits under the system as governments instituted restrictions on capital flows and aligned their monetary policy to support their pegs.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet {{party leader}} Leonid Brezhnev adopted a more conciliatory tone than his {{orthodox}} colleagues.

Edward Gierek of Poland and János Kádár of Hungary also placed themselves within the orthodox camp in their speeches to the conference, but kept a lower profile and expressed certain individual nuances.|$|E

25|$|German Americans by {{this time}} usually had only weak ties to Germany; however, they were fearful of {{negative}} treatment they might receive if the United States entered the war (such mistreatment was already happening to German-descent citizens in Canada and Australia).

They were increasingly marginalized, however, and by 1917 had been excluded almost entirely from national <b>discourse</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject.|$|E
