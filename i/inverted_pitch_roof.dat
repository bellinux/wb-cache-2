Two alternatives emerged: an accurate reconstruction of the mansard roof, or a flat <b>pitched</b> <b>roof.</b> Timber was in short supply, so a <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> requiring 214 sqm sq ft of timber was chosen, instead of a mansard roof requiring 930 sqm sq ft.

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{purposes}} of a roof is to resist water. Two broad categories of roofs are flat and <b>pitched.</b> Flat <b>roofs</b> actually slope up to 10° or 15° but are built to resist standing water. <b>Pitched</b> <b>roofs</b> are designed to shed water but not resist standing water which can occur during wind-driven rain or ice damming. Typically residential, <b>pitched</b> <b>roofs</b> are covered with an underlayment material beneath the roof covering material as a second line of defense. Domestic roof construction may also be ventilated to help remove moisture from leakage and condensation.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} accuracy of computer programmes to simulate the illuminance level in atrium buildings compare to the measurement of those in physical models. The case was taken in atrium building with 4 types of <b>roof</b> i. e. <b>pitched</b> <b>roof,</b> barrel vault <b>roof,</b> monitor <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> (both monitor <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> and monitor barrel vault roof), and north light roof (both with north orientation and south orientation). The results show that both methods have agreement and disagreement. They show {{the same pattern of}} daylight distribution. In the other side, in terms of daylight factors, computer simulation tends to underestimate calculation compared to physical model measurement, while for average and minimum illumination, it tends to overestimate the calculation...|$|R

40|$|Wind {{tunnel model}} studies {{were carried out}} to {{determine}} the external wind pressure distributions on large, low-rise buildings with <b>roof</b> <b>pitches</b> of 15 degrees and 35 degrees. The studies showed {{a significant increase in the}} magnitude of the mean and peak negative pressure coefficients with an increase in length to span aspect ratio, on the downwind roof and leeward wall, near the windward gable-end of building with a steep 35 degrees <b>pitch</b> <b>roof,</b> for oblique approach winds. These oblique approach winds also generate large design wind load effects on the frames near the gable-end. There is little variation in mean and peak pressure coefficients with aspect ratio, across the frame of the building with a moderate 15 degrees <b>pitch</b> <b>roof.</b> AS/NZS 1170. 2, which specifies increased suction pressures with aspect ratio on the downwind roof slope and leeward wall of steep <b>pitch</b> <b>roof</b> buildings compared to the previous edition of the standard, provides satisfactory design wind load effects on frames near gable-end. However, some design load effects on frames near the gable-end of the 15 degrees <b>pitch</b> <b>roof</b> building are underestimated by AS/NZS 1170. 2...|$|R

5000|$|The six-story {{building}} was constructed from local limestone with a nail-less timber frame and a <b>pitched</b> <b>roof.</b> In 1907 a tornado ripped up {{the roof and}} top story, which the operators replaced with a flat plank roof. A more classically accurate <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> was restored in recent years. [...] The mill {{is powered by a}} 20 ft water wheel. [...] Most of the mill's original machinery is still intact and operable.|$|R

30|$|Similarly, <b>pitched</b> <b>roofs</b> (Roofs 2, 4, 9) were sampled using {{systematic}} transects, which {{permit the}} description of maximum variation across an environmental gradient over the shortest distance (Kent and Coker, 1994). The diversity of roof constructions from this primary survey was united for analysis because of the limited sample size but also through reference to the methodological approach of Buttschardt (2001), whose surveys included two <b>pitched</b> <b>roofs</b> {{in a sample of}} less than ten EGRs.|$|R

50|$|Another {{important}} distinction is between <b>pitched</b> green <b>roofs</b> and flat green <b>roofs.</b> <b>Pitched</b> sod <b>roofs,</b> a traditional feature of many Scandinavian buildings, {{tend to be}} of a simpler design than flat green roofs. This is because the <b>pitch</b> of the <b>roof</b> {{reduces the risk of}} water penetrating through the roof structure, allowing the use of fewer waterproofing and drainage layers.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{shapes of}} roofs are flat, mono-pitched, gabled, hipped, butterfly, arched and domed. There are many {{variations}} on these types. Roofs constructed of flat sections that are sloped {{are referred to}} as <b>pitched</b> <b>roofs</b> (generally if the angle exceeds 10 degrees). <b>Pitched</b> <b>roofs,</b> including gabled, hipped and skillion roofs, make up the greatest number of domestic roofs. Some roofs follow organic shapes, either by architectural design or because a flexible material such as thatch has been used in the construction.|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} a large, brick church in the late Gothic Revival style with {{elements}} of the Decorated Gothic style. It was designed by McMurphy & Story in Augusta. It has a steeply <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> and rectangular nave. The facade has a gabled central section flanked by two towers. One tower has a <b>pitched</b> <b>roof.</b> The other has a tall, white spire with a gold cross. The rectangular nave has a timbered roof. It has stained-glass windows in Florentine arches.|$|R
