His father had fought the disease twice, {{and both were}} predisposed to it through Lynch syndrome.

5|$|When Simone {{was given}} the task {{to write a book}} about Madonna, she was {{enthusiastic}} about the opportunity, since she had admired the singer's musical output and her ambitious nature which has led to a successful career in show-business. Simone recalled how Madonna <b>had</b> <b>struggled</b> through her early days in New York city, and through her tough business mind and musical intuition had succeeded in crafting her own niche.|$|E
5|$|A report {{into the}} {{experience}} of refugees resettled in Brighton and Hove under the scheme between October 2006 and October 2007 was published by the Sussex Centre for Migration Research at the University of Sussex in December 2007. The report found that the refugees <b>had</b> <b>struggled</b> to gain employment and English language skills. Another evaluation report undertaken for the Home Office and published in 2011 also found that only small numbers of resettled refugees were in paid employment, noting that many were still more concerned about meeting their basic needs.|$|E

5|$|Gary Megson was {{appointed}} Norwich manager {{on a temporary}} basis {{for the second time}} in eight months: he had also briefly filled this role after Deehan's departure. Megson remained in charge until the end of the 1995–96 season before leaving the club. Mike Walker, who <b>had</b> <b>struggled</b> at Everton, was re-appointed as the club's manager. He was unable to repeat the success achieved during his first spell and was sacked in the 1997–98 season with Norwich mid-table in the First Division.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, {{with the}} {{recommendation}} of Oklahoma athletic director Jap Haskell, Tatum was hired as the Sooners' head coach and brought Wilkinson as an assistant. Tatum replaced Dewey Luster, who resigned due to ill health. Luster <b>had</b> <b>struggled</b> in the position as the Second World War put a continuous and heavy drain on athletes at the University of Oklahoma. The final game before Luster's resignation was a 0–47 loss {{at the hands of}} Oklahoma A, which rounded out Oklahoma's 1945 season with a 5–5 record.|$|E
5|$|In June 1886, Holmes {{received}} an honorary degree from Yale University Law School.

The younger Amelia died the following year after a brief malady. Despite his weakening eyesight and a fear that he was becoming antiquated, Holmes continued to find solace in writing.

5|$|The 1894–95 {{season was}} the 14th season of {{competitive}} association football and third {{season in the}} Football League played by Small Heath F.C., an English football club based in Birmingham. In 1893–94, Small Heath finished in {{second place in the}} divisional championship and gained promotion by defeating Darwen 3–1 in a test match. The club <b>had</b> <b>struggled</b> financially during the season, and there were suggestions that it might have disbanded had promotion not been secured. In their first season in the First Division, they finished in 12th place in the 16-team division, thus avoiding the possibility of relegation via the test matches.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees <b>had</b> <b>struggled</b> {{prior to}} Ruppert and Huston's purchase, having only one winning record in their {{previous}} eight seasons. They made Pipp their starting first baseman {{in time for}} Opening Day of the 1915 season. The Yankees added Home Run Baker in 1916, and they formed {{the center of the}} Yankees' batting order. Pipp led the American League in home runs with 12 in 1916; Baker finished second with 10. Pipp hit nine home runs in 1917, again leading the league.|$|E
5|$|Vincenzo Nibali {{was also}} {{cited as a}} {{potential}} winner of the race, following a difficult season. He <b>had</b> <b>struggled</b> during the Tour de France and was subsequently {{thrown out of the}} Vuelta for holding on to a team car. He had therefore made Il Lombardia a significant target. Nibali had performed strongly in the other late-season Italian classics, while his team had shown its strength in supporting Diego Rosa to victory in Milano–Torino. Fabio Aru, who had won the Vuelta, was not present: he was riding the Tour of Almaty instead.|$|E

5|$|Although he had {{attained}} {{success as}} a producer, Kanye West aspired to be a rapper, but <b>had</b> <b>struggled</b> to attain a record deal. Record companies ignored him {{because he did not}} portray the gangsta image prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time. After a series of meetings with Capitol Records, West was ultimately denied an artist deal. According to Capitol Record's A, Joe Weinberger, he was approached by West and almost signed a deal with him, but another person in the company convinced Capitol's president not to. Desperate to keep West from defecting to another label, then-label head Damon Dash reluctantly signed West to Roc-A-Fella Records. Jay-Z, West's colleague, later admitted that Roc-A-Fella was initially reluctant to support West as a rapper, claiming that many saw him as a producer first and foremost, and that his background contrasted with that of his labelmates.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev <b>had</b> <b>struggled</b> {{with several}} ailments since 1974, most notably heart disease, leukemia, jaw cancer, {{emphysema}} and circulatory disease, {{all of which}} had been exacerbated by his heavy smoking and obesity. There had been rumours of Brezhnev's death ever since the mid-1970s; he had been absent from important meetings demanded by protocol and it was rumoured that his health was in decline. Brezhnev had rarely appeared in public for most of 1982 and was usually surrounded by doctors, although the Soviet Government insisted that he was not ill. He suffered a severe stroke in May 1982, but refused to relinquish office until he died on 10 November 1982 after suffering a heart attack. He was honoured with a state funeral in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis on the Red Square after a five-day period of nationwide mourning.|$|E

5|$|Examples of Rossier's {{views of}} Switzerland {{are held in}} several {{institutions}} and private collections in that country. Rossier took the first commercial photographs of China and Japan, and they are now quite rare. He complained at times of the adverse effects of the climate on his photographic chemicals {{and some of his}} negatives may have been damaged en route to London from Asia. Though his surviving images are scarce, his importance to the early history of photography in Asia is great. Before his arrival in Japan in 1859, Japanese students of photography <b>had</b> <b>struggled</b> to produce satisfactory images, but Rossier's experience, instruction, and contacts with suppliers of photographic materials were extremely helpful in the development of an autonomous photographic tradition in Japan.|$|E
5|$|In March, {{hundreds}} {{of political prisoners}} were freed, with Gaddafi falsely claiming {{that there were no}} further political prisoners in Libya. In June, Libya's government issued the Great Green Charter on Human Rights in the Era of the Masses, in which 27 articles laid out goals, rights and guarantees to improve the situation of human rights in Libya, restricting the use of the death penalty and calling for its eventual abolition. Many of the measures suggested in the charter would be implemented the following year, although others remained inactive. Also in 1989, the government founded the Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights, to be awarded to figures from the Third World who <b>had</b> <b>struggled</b> against colonialism and imperialism; the first year's winner was South African anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela. From 1994 through to 1997, the government initiated cleansing committees to root out corruption, particularly in the economic sector.|$|E
5|$|John {{had lost}} most of his ancestral lands in France to King Philip II in 1204 and <b>had</b> <b>struggled</b> to regain them for many years, raising {{extensive}} taxes on the barons to accumulate money {{to fight a war}} which ended in expensive failure in 1214. Following the defeat of his allies at the Battle of Bouvines, John had to sue for peace and pay compensation. John was already personally unpopular with many of the barons, many of whom owed money to the Crown, and little trust existed between the two sides. A triumph would have strengthened his position, but in the face of his defeat, within a few months after his return from France John found that rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising resistance to his rule.|$|E

5|$|Mind Meld: Secrets Behind the Voyage of a Lifetime is a 2001 American {{documentary}} film in which actors William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy discuss the Star Trek science fiction franchise {{and its effects}} on their lives. Shatner and Nimoy portrayed the characters James T. Kirk and Spock respectively in the , the , and their film sequels. They talk about differences they had with Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, and about the strained relationships between Shatner {{and some of the other}} cast members. It was in this film that Nimoy first publicly revealed that he <b>had</b> <b>struggled</b> with alcoholism while he was acting in the original television series. Shatner talks about the death of his third wife, Nerine Kidd, who accidentally drowned in a pool in 1999 after suffering from alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|The 1955 Dodgers {{got off to}} {{a strong}} start. Even so, an Associated Press article noted that Alston was reticent in {{response}} to questions and that he did not seem like a manager who had won ten consecutive games. The 1955 Brooklyn team won the pennant and its only World Series championship. They clinched the NL pennant earlier in the year than any team had in NL history. In the World Series, Alston started Johnny Podres, who had a mediocre 9-10 regular season record, in the third and seventh games; Podres won both games. The pitcher <b>had</b> <b>struggled</b> with arm problems for much of the season.|$|E
5|$|The SPARS enjoyed {{success in}} the work place, but they also {{suffered}} a degree of intolerance at times.

Attitudes toward them ranged from enthusiasm and amusement to open hostility. But not all the objections were personal or petty. Many of the men simply failed to see the need for women in the service, while others felt it was an unnecessary expense. However, if the women were equal to the job the men were willing to give them their due. Many men, regulars and reservists, supported them, taught them the ropes, and gave them encouragement.|$|E
