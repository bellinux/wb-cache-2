25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started first. We were playing the riff on an {{accordion}} and Guy came in one morning and said, 'I'm afraid I have to put my foot down. I don't want to speak out of turn, but I will not allow this song to be played on an accordion - that has to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the Mylo bunch'. So then we thought — let's just make one album.|$|E
25|$|However, the B-25's as {{high level}} bombers were flying without escort fighters. Although better armed were still treated badly by swarms of Zeros. On 24 May 6 B-25s {{attacked}} Lae Airfield {{and one of}} them came back. Harassing missions were flown out of Jackson Field with the A-24s until 29 July when an eight ship convoy was spotted 50 miles north of Buna, Papua New Guinea. Five of seven A-24s that had taken off to attack the convoy were shot down by enemy fighter planes. They initially had an escort of P-39's. Somewhere over the Owen Stanley Mountains they lost their escort and decided to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> out them. Subsequently, they ran into 24 Japanese fighters over Buna. In the succeeding battle against overwhelming Zero odds and shattering anti-aircraft fire the Squadron suffered heavy losses.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after {{finishing}} off their Alive 2006/2007 tour, Daft Punk {{began working on}} new material in 2008. Thomas Bangalter of the duo recalled, [...] "the two of us would <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> a lot of keyboards, guitars, drums, and stuff and started to do demos for six, seven months." [...] Daft Punk were pleased with the work in terms of composition, but were dissatisfied with the production aspect, as they relied on samples and loops of their own performances: [...] "We could play some riffs and stuff but not keep it [...] for four minutes straight." [...] Daft Punk put these demos aside and started work on the [...] film soundtrack later in 2008. As Bangalter mentioned after the film's release in 2010: [...] "Making music for a movie is very humbling. We’ve been working on some of our music concurrently." [...] Daft Punk then decided to work extensively with live musicians on what would become Random Access Memories: [...] "We wanted {{to do what we}} used to do with machines and samplers, but with people." [...] They avoided the use of samples on the album, {{with the exception of the}} closing track [...] "Contact".|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, [...] "L'Affair Henry the, ahem, touchiest {{sporting}} {{controversy in}} living memory" [...] received its own episode of Scannal, the TV series dedicated to scandalous events. The Evening Herald reviewer {{called it an}} [...] "entertaining, tightly-packaged edition" [...] of the show but also opined, [...] "Where Scannal stumbled, however, was in its failure to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> both feet on the cringe-inducing elephant in the room: John Delaney's embarrassing plea to Fifa boss, the odious Sepp Blatter, to let Ireland be [...] "the 33rd team" [...] at the World Cup".|$|E
2500|$|Swift {{explained}} to Billboard. [...] "I {{think the reason}} I said that was because I made the record {{exactly the same way}} I made the last three. I knew I hadn't jumped out of my comfort zone, which at the time was writing alone and working with Nathan. [...] the song was a real turning point for Red the album. When I wrote that song my mind started wandering to all the places we could go. If I were to think outside the box enough, <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> different people, I could learn from and have what they do rub off on me as well as have what I do rub off on them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Public {{perception}} is that the Iraqis were confrontational and blocking {{the work of the}} inspectors. In 98% of the inspections, the Iraqis did everything we asked them to because it dealt with disarmament. However when we got into issues of sensitivity, such as coming close to presidential security installations, Iraqis raised a flag and said, [...] "Time out. We got a C.I.A. out there that's trying to kill our president and we're not very happy about giving you access to the most sensitive installations and the most sensitive personalities in Iraq." [...] So we had these modalities, where we agreed that if we came to a site and the Iraqis called it 'sensitive,' we <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> four people.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999 Merton {{replaced}} Nick Hancock {{as host of}} Room 101, a chat show {{in which}} guests are offered the chance to discuss their pet hates and consign them to the oblivion of Room 101. His first guest was Hancock. He hosted 64 editions. In 2007, his final guest was Ian Hislop (who became the first interviewee to appear twice, having also been on an edition with Hancock). Hislop's selections purposely included items that Merton was known to like, such as The Beatles and the films of Charlie Chaplin. [...] Hislop's final choice was Merton himself, done to represent his departure from the show. [...] Merton cast himself in the room to end the show, although {{on the condition that}} Hislop would <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> him.|$|E
2500|$|On September 21, 2006, Roskam {{said that}} the U.S. should [...] "stay the course" [...] and that U.S. troops should not return home until Iraq is safe. He criticized his {{opponent}} Tammy Duckworth (an Iraq veteran)'s views on withdrawal, saying [...] "the Sixth District is not a cut-and-run district." [...] On October 23, 2006, Roskam {{said it was a}} mistake the U.S. didn't <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> full force in Iraq. Later, he expressed support for quarterly status reports to Congress on Iraqi troop training. Roskam supported the 2007 escalation in troops in Iraq, saying, [...] "There are encouraging reports coming out of Iraq that Baghdad is becoming more secure, and the insurgency is being mitigated. This is a pivotal time. Iraqis need to seize this opportunity to provide security for themselves so we can begin to reduce our troop numbers on the ground." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{press release}} also {{revealed}} {{she had worked}} with Salaam Remi, something which Love confirmed {{when he said he}} had worked on a song with Remi called [...] "Love Is the Greatest" [...] that he hoped would make the album. Of these recordings, only [...] "Motivation" [...] made the album appearing as song number three, while its Rebel Rock Remix appears on the deluxe edition as track thirteen. In another interview Rowland told the Daily Star that she had spoken to will.i.am about working on the album and was also keen to get Sean [...] "Diddy" [...] Combs on the album. Shondrae 'Bangladesh' Crawford who is best known for producing [...] "Diva" [...] and [...] "Video Phone" [...] by Rowland's ex-bandmate and close friend Beyoncé, revealed to Rap-Up that he had also been in the studio with Rowland. Of the collaborations, Bangladesh said, [...] "the music that we've done is just hard, it's edgy, but it's still sexy, and it's not raunchy ... What I like to do when I <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> artists, I like to recreate and reinvent 'em, even if they didn't need that." [...] Another song recorded for the album was the Brian Kennedy-produced dance song [...] "On and On" [...] which was written by Kennedy, Merritt, Rowland and Robert Allen. [...] "On and On" [...] was used in episode fifteen of the MTV reality TV series The Hills. Both Bangladesh and Kennedy productions are omitted from the album.|$|E

2500|$|Heavy Rain was {{critically}} acclaimed. The UK Official PlayStation Magazine reviewer Tim Clark wrote, [...] "I'm convinced it's {{one of the}} freshest, most exciting, {{and even}} important games on PS3 so far." [...] Clark praised the effective controls of the game, {{as well as the}} pacing of the story, which the reviewer described as key, and perfectly designed to create an [...] "exhausting, exhilarating, and, crucially, involving" [...] experience. He concluded by saying that, [...] "Certainly there's nothing quite like it on PS3, or indeed any other system. Put gaming conventions aside, <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> no expectations other than this is something new and massively good-looking, and you'll be rewarded with a unique experience that lurches between genius and madness, manages to be genuinely emotional, and that you'll be bursting to talk about with your friends." [...] GamesMaster complimented Heavy Rain for being [...] "incredibly original and compelling", as [...] "the atmosphere is incredible – full of driving rain (which becomes central to the plot), fizzing neon lights, dark apartments and warehouses. It's a dark noir game, not a bright adventure." [...] The game was given a GamesMaster Gold Award. IGN's Chris Roper praised the game's [...] "fantastic story that's {{one of the best in}} gaming." [...] However, he pointed out that the game's beginning is very slow, and might turn off some players. GameZone's Michael Lafferty wrote, [...] "There are some flaws, but taken as a package, Heavy Rain is a remarkable achievement in gaming that creates an interactive experience that goes beyond the pages of a good novel or film noir. This is a game that needs to be experienced." [...] Winda Benedetti wrote about the maturity of Heavy Rain as well as Remedy Entertainment's psychological action thriller Alan Wake for MSNBC, praising both titles for being [...] "emotionally powerful" [...] as well as having [...] "said goodbye to the tired alien invasions and over-the-top fantasy stories so often found in video games. Instead, they peer into the dark reaches of the very real human heart to deliver stories that are thrilling, chilling and utterly absorbing." ...|$|E
