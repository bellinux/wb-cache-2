40|$|Abstract. The {{ability for}} {{providing}} a hardware platform {{which can be}} customized on a per-application basis under software control has established Reconfigurable Computing (RC) as a new computing paradigm. A machine employing the RC paradigm {{is referred to as}} a Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machine (FCCM). So far, the FCCMs have been classified according to implementation criteria. For the previous classifications do not reveal the entire meaning of the RC paradigm, we propose to classify the FCCMs according to architectural cri-teria. To analyze the phenomena inside FCCMs, we introduce a formalism based on microcode, in which any <b>custom</b> <b>operation</b> performed by a field-programmed computing facility is executed as a microprogram with two basic stages: SET CONFIGURATION and EXECUTE <b>CUSTOM</b> <b>OPERATION.</b> Based on the SET=EXECUTE formalism, we then propose an architectural-based taxonomy of FCCMs. ...|$|R
