5|$|A new, {{redesigned}} MacBook {{line was}} launched on March 9, 2015. Available in silver, gold or space grey, it is thinner than the MacBook Air and removes the traditional MagSafe charging port (along {{with all other}} ports, except the <b>headphone</b> <b>jack)</b> {{in favor of the}} multi-purpose USB-C port. It also features a Retina display. On April 19, 2016, Apple updated the 12-inch Retina MacBook with new sixth-generation Intel Core M processors, longer battery life and a rose gold option.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{offers several}} other accessories, {{most of which}} are {{adapters}} for the proprietary 30-pin dock connector, the only port besides the <b>headphone</b> <b>jack.</b> A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has a dock connector and audio line-out port. The iPad can use Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs. The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter ("wall charger") compatible with iPods and iPhones, and a 10 Watt charger is included.|$|E

Each generation of iPad requires a corresponding dock. A dock that included a physical keyboard was only supported for the original iPad, but all generations are compatible with Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs. The iPad can be charged with a 10 W standalone power adapter, which is also compatible with iPods and iPhones.|$|E
50|$|The Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter {{allows the}} use of {{headsets}} with 3.5 millimeter <b>headphone</b> <b>jacks</b> with the original Xbox One controller, which didn't include the 3.5 mm jack. An adapter for 2.5 millimeter <b>headphone</b> <b>jacks</b> (except for ones with a dongle-like adapter) is also included.|$|R
5000|$|Electronics with jacks for {{accessories}} were traditionally {{described as}} having 3/32" [...] (common for tape recorder motor control), 1/8" [...] (earphone), or 1/4" [...] (<b>headphone)</b> <b>jacks.</b> This was later replaced by the 2.5 mm headset (common on older mobile phones). Now nearly all <b>headphone</b> <b>jacks</b> use 3.5 mm connectors.|$|R

The iPad can use Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs. The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter ("wall charger") also used for iPods and iPhones, and a 10 W charger is included with the iPad.|$|E
5|$|Contrasting {{with the}} company's usual method for {{designing}} motherboards, the first components that Asus {{placed on the}} device's PCB were the speakers. This was done to ensure the other components did not force speaker placement towards one side, which would harm sound quality. The design saw the implementation of two microphones to ensure the user's hand placement on the device would not muffle sound during videoconferencing, while the <b>headphone</b> <b>jack</b> {{was moved to the}} bottom of the device, preventing the headphone wire from draping across the screen.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One uses a 4.7 inch, 1080p Super LCD 3 {{touchscreen}} display with a {{pixel density}} of 468 ppi. The backside {{of the device}} houses the camera, the LED flash, and the secondary microphone. At {{the top of the}} device is a 0.14-inch (3.6mm) <b>headphone</b> <b>jack</b> and the power/lock key, which also functions as an infrared blaster. At the bottom is the primary microphone and a microUSB port for both data connections and charging; the device can stream HDMI via the microUSB port using MHL.|$|E
50|$|A <b>headphone</b> (or earphone) <b>jack</b> is {{commonly}} {{one of the}} three standard sizes of 3-conductor TRS <b>headphone</b> <b>jacks,</b> but the term could refer to any socket used for this purpose.|$|R

50|$|The control CPU is an Intel P8098. Same DAC, {{but with}} 16 bits of input signal {{resolution}} (see below). A stereo 1/4″ TRS <b>headphones</b> <b>jack</b> is added.|$|R
5|$|The iPad can use Wi-Fi network {{trilateration}} from Skyhook Wireless {{to provide}} location information to {{applications such as}} Google Maps. The 3G model supports A-GPS to allow its position to be calculated with GPS or relative to nearby cellphone towers; {{it also has a}} black strip on the back to aid 3G reception. The iPad has a <b>headphone</b> <b>jack</b> and a proprietary Apple dock connector, but no Ethernet or USB port. However, the Apple Camera Connection Kit accessory provides two dock connector adapters for importing photos and videos via USB and SD memory cards.|$|E
5|$|All ports {{have been}} {{replaced}} with either two or four combination USB-C 3.1 ports that support Thunderbolt 3 and dual DisplayPort 1.2 signals, any {{of which can be}} used for charging. The MacBook Pro is incompatible with some older Thunderbolt 3 certified peripherals, including Intel's own reference design for Thunderbolt 3 devices. Furthermore, MacOS on MacBook Pro blocks certain classes of Thunderbolt 3 compatible devices from working by blacklisting them. Devices using HDMI, previous generation Thunderbolt, and USB will require an adapter to connect to the MacBook Pro. The models come with a 3.5 mm <b>headphone</b> <b>jack,</b> although TOSLINK functionality of older generation MacBook Pros has been removed.|$|E

5|$|The main CPU of the Sega CD is a 12.5MHz 16-bit Motorola 68000 processor, {{which runs}} 5MHz {{faster than the}} Genesis processor. It {{contains}} 1 Mbit of boot ROM, allocated for the CD game BIOS, CD player software, and compatibility with CD+G discs. 6 Mbit of RAM are allocated to data for programs, pictures, and sounds; 512 Kbit to PCM waveform memory; 128 Kbit to CD-ROM data cache memory; and an additional 64 Kbit are allocated as the backup memory. Additional backup memory {{in the form of}} a 1 Mbit Backup RAM Cartridge was also available as a separate purchase, released near the end of the system's life. Audio is able to be supplied through the Ricoh RF5C164, and two RCA pin jacks allow the Sega CD to output stereophonic sound separate from the Genesis. Combining stereo sound from a Genesis to either version of the Sega CD requires a cable between the Genesis's <b>headphone</b> <b>jack</b> and an input jack on the back of the CD unit. This is not required for the second model of the Genesis.|$|E
25|$|The <b>headphone</b> <b>jack</b> and dock {{connector}} swapped locations so {{that the}} <b>headphone</b> <b>jack</b> was {{to the left of}} the dock connector. Therefore, the fifth generation iPod Nano used a different Apple Universal Dock insert than the fourth generation.|$|E
25|$|In particular, Apple's vice {{president}} Phillip Schiller, who announced the change, was mocked extensively online for stating that removing the <b>headphone</b> <b>jack</b> took 'courage'. An online petition {{created by the}} consumer group SumOfUs, that accuses Apple of planned obsolescence and causing substantial electronic waste by removing the <b>headphone</b> <b>jack,</b> reached over 300,000 signatures.|$|E
