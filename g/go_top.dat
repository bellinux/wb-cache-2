5|$|In {{a crucial}} Premier League match away to Everton on 3 May, Nasri {{provided}} the assist for Edin Džeko's game-winning goal as City {{came from behind}} to win 3–2 and <b>go</b> <b>top</b> of the table with two matches remaining. On 11 May, Nasri scored Manchester City's opening goal in a 2–0 defeat of West Ham United as the club won the 2013–14 Premier League title.|$|E
5|$|The unbeaten run {{came to an}} end at Christmas, with {{back-to-back}} defeats in matches against West Bromwich Albion {{causing the}} club to fall to fourth place. The team commenced 1968 with a seven match unbeaten run, starting with consecutive 3–0 wins at Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United, and culminating in a 5–1 defeat of Fulham to <b>go</b> <b>top</b> of the table. The run {{came to an end}} with a defeat at Don Revie's Leeds United, which also meant City were overtaken {{at the top of the}} table by local rivals Manchester United. A visit to United's Old Trafford ground then followed. United took an early lead, but City rallied to win 3–1.|$|E
5|$|Bolton {{struggled}} {{in the following}} two seasons, but survived in the Premiership. The 2001–02 season began with a shock as they destroyed Leicester 5–0 at Filbert Street to <b>go</b> <b>top</b> of the table. Despite a 2–1 win away at Manchester United, becoming the first team since {{the formation of the}} Premiership to come from behind and win a league game at Old Trafford, they went into a deep slump {{during the middle of the}} season and needed a Fredi Bobic hat-trick against Ipswich Town to survive. Despite losing the final three games, 16th place was secured. The 2002–03 season began with a poor start and, despite another win away at Manchester United, they were bottom until a 4–2 win against Leeds United at Elland Road. Despite suffering from a lack of consistency, Bolton achieved the results needed and secured survival in a final day 2–1 victory over Middlesbrough.|$|E
5000|$|The band have {{released}} three singles on the Glasgow-based label, Measured Records. Two singles <b>went</b> <b>top</b> 5 and one <b>went</b> <b>top</b> 20 in the Scottish Chart. Their debut album One More Won't Kill Us {{was released on}} 5 February 2007.|$|R

5|$|Manchester United drew {{their first}} and only home blank of the season against Newcastle United, but made amends with a 3–2 victory over bottom team Blackburn Rovers. Defensive frailties, most notably from Schmeichel, were on show away to Sheffield Wednesday as the team missed the chance to <b>go</b> <b>top</b> of the table. A brace from winger Jens Niclas Alexandersson and a debut goal scored by Wim Jonk {{consigned}} Ferguson to his second defeat {{in the league and}} extended a barren run at Hillsborough; United had won only a single game in their last eight visits. On 29 November, Manchester United hosted Leeds United and a valiant performance by the visitors looked to have gained them a draw, after going two goals down in the first half. A moment of brilliance from Butt however secured the three points for the Red Devils and kept up the pressure on the challengers.|$|E
5|$|Colbeck {{had been}} playing since January with a groin injury, which {{hampered}} his preparations for the 2008–09 season and prevented him from playing in Bradford's first three pre-season friendly matches. His suspension also {{kept him out of}} Bradford's first two games of the season, but he returned for a 2–0 victory against Macclesfield Town. He provided a cross for Peter Thorne to open the scoring after ten minutes. Colbeck helped City to <b>go</b> <b>top</b> of the league six matches into the season, and although he scored his first goal of the season in the seventh game, City lost 3–1 to Bournemouth. He added a second in a 2–2 home draw with Gillingham, before he broke a bone in his foot the following week against Grimsby Town. Colbeck was unable to play for nearly three months. He returned from injury in January by playing in two reserve games, leading up to his first-team return on 24 January as a late second-half substitute for Omar Daley in a 3–3 draw with Luton Town. Colbeck broke back into the starting eleven the following month, once again for Daley, who was ruled out for the season with his own knee injury. He was a regular in the team {{for the rest of the}} season, playing a further 16 games but he struggled for form and was unable to add to his two goals.|$|E
25|$|On 17 October, the Pura Cup began, {{with the}} Bulls {{taking on the}} Tasmanian Tigers. Tasmania were {{effectively}} 17 for 7 in the second innings when rain intervened, ending the match in a draw. A day later, Victorian Bushrangers completed a four-wicket victory at the WACA Ground to <b>go</b> <b>top</b> of the Pura Cup table. The week-end from 22 to 23 October saw a full round of ING Cup games, the Blues beating the Southern Redbacks to <b>go</b> <b>top</b> of the table, while the Bulls and the Western Warriors also chased down targets to record wins.|$|E

A low-scoring draw with Gloucestershire followed, which left both sides struggling in the relegation zone.|$|E
25|$|On 16 March 2014, Gerrard {{scored two}} {{penalties}} and missed another in Liverpool's 3–0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford.

These goals took him above Kenny Dalglish as Liverpool's sixth-top goalscorer of all time.|$|E
25|$|On 19 August, Manchester City beat reigning Premier League champions Manchester United to <b>go</b> <b>top</b> of the 2007–08 Premier League {{after three}} games without conceding a goal.

25|$|June {{started with}} a draw in the Championship against Derbyshire, before taking a last-wicket National League win against Middlesex at Lord's to <b>go</b> <b>top</b> of the National League. Four days later, they {{travelled}} to the Riverside Ground to take on Durham in a top-of-the-table battle in the Championship, but Essex lost by an innings and 19 runs inside three days to fall to fourth. However, they recorded National League wins over Gloucestershire and Worcestershire, to take a four-point lead in the National League before the Twenty20 break.|$|E
25|$|Playing in the First Division for the 1974–75 season. Carlisle {{won their}} first three {{fixtures}} to <b>go</b> <b>top</b> of the English football pyramid, {{partly due to}} the likes of Chris Balderstone, scoring the penalty which put them at the top, and Bobby Parker who both went on to make at least 375 league appearances for Carlisle. The success was short lived however, they finished the season in bottom place and were relegated. Highlight victories include doing a double over Everton, and home victories over eventual champions Derby County, and former title holders Ipswich Town, Arsenal, Burnley, Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers.|$|E
25|$|The {{third week}} of August saw Sussex thump Middlesex inside two days, beating them by an innings and 232 runs - the highest margin of victory in the entire season - to {{temporarily}} <b>go</b> <b>top</b> of Division One, only 18 days after they had been precariously positioned in the relegation zone. However, the week ended with another loss to Leicestershire in the National League, which meant that Leicestershire also involved themselves in the title battle in Division Two. Three days later, Sussex beat Warwickshire in the same competition, mainly thanks to figures of 6-27 from Michael Yardy. In the County Championship, however, they lost to Warwickshire, before finishing August with two National League victories over Scotland and Surrey.|$|E

25|$|Durham {{came back}} from the Twenty20 Cup to play a Championship match against Lancashire and fell to their first defeat of the season - which was also the highest margin of defeat thus far in the County Championship, beating Durham's innings-and-216-run win over Leicestershire three months earlier. Meanwhile, they lost their National League lead without playing a game, as Sussex Sharks beat Kent Spitfires to <b>go</b> <b>top</b> - and six days later, when Durham had the chance to go past Sussex again, they lost to Warwickshire in a game {{featuring}} less than 300 runs in total. Durham rounded off the month with three matches without loss, however, as they beat Derbyshire in the League and Somerset in the Championship to have a 24.5-point lead {{at the end of the}} month. In the League, however, Warwickshire overtook them as they fell to third place.|$|E
25|$|The {{first round}} of the league stage of the C Trophy was played out on 23 April. In the South Conference, Essex (in a 10-over affair), Gloucestershire, Hampshire and Somerset (after Marcus Trescothick's 158) {{recorded}} wins, while Derbyshire, Lancashire and Worcestershire won in the North. Sri Lanka began their tour the following day, drawing with a British Universities XI at Fenner's, and {{the second round of the}} Championship took place from 26 April to 29 April with seven matches. Durham fell back to earth after their initial win, giving up 421 runs in the first innings to Lancashire and losing by 128 runs, while Pakistanis Naved-ul-Hasan and Mushtaq Ahmed claimed 14 of 20 wickets for Sussex in their win at Hampshire, who failed to pick up batting points for the second time this season. Kent chased down 354 for the loss of three wickets against Middlesex at Lord's, and Warwickshire, despite giving up 433 in the fourth innings, beat Yorkshire to <b>go</b> <b>top</b> of the table.|$|E
25|$|Durham's 100%-record {{was broken}} by the rain, as the National League matches with Scottish Saltires and Sussex Sharks were rained off to leave Durham second in the National League table behind Yorkshire. On 5 May, they {{suffered}} their first loss, as Derbyshire beat them by one wicket. However, two Championship matches followed from 6 May to 13 May, and Durham lengthened their run of Championship victories to four, beating Somerset at home and Lancashire at Old Trafford. Two days after beating Lancashire, Durham beat Yorkshire in the National League to <b>go</b> <b>top</b> of the table, and Yorkshire stayed in the North for a Championship match - Durham's win streak was broken as they teams drew, but Durham took ten points, as they finished their fourth innings on 226 for 8 chasing 245. The month was rounded off with a draw against Durham UCCE and two National League matches, one win and one loss (their first League loss of the season) to leave Durham with a 7.5-point lead in the Championship and a four-point lead in the League (although Yorkshire in second place had two games in hand).|$|E

5000|$|Player is an American {{rock band}} that made their mark {{during the late}} 1970s.

500|$|Before {{the start}} of 1976–77 season, Keegan said, [...] "There's a {{tremendous}} ambition among all the lads to win the European Cup. We've won {{everything else in the}} last five years and there's a feeling that the European Cup is going to be next." [...] Liverpool started by losing only two of their first 16 games in the League to <b>go</b> <b>top</b> by September. Despite a Christmas period blip including a 5–1 loss to Aston Villa, Liverpool won their tenth League title. The 1977 European Cup Final was Liverpool's first. McDermott, Smith and Neal goals gave a 3-1 win over Borussia Mönchengladbach. They lost the 1977 FA Cup Final 2-1 to Manchester United to miss out on a trophy treble.|$|E
500|$|The {{visit of}} champions Liverpool in early December {{was seen by}} Graham and the media {{as a test of}} Arsenal's {{championship}} credentials. Arsenal entered the match boasting the division's best attacking record, while Liverpool conceded the fewest in the competition. In the game Liverpool went ahead through left winger John Barnes, but their lead was short lived as Smith equalised. Both sides spurned chances to win the game late on and the score stayed 1–1 at full time; Kenny Dalglish, the Liverpool player-manager however was delighted with a point and said afterwards: [...] "That was as entertaining as any of the other four games we have played against each other this season." [...] Arsenal failed to score {{for the first time in}} the season when they played league leaders Norwich City on 10 December 1988. The team returned to winning ways during the Christmas period. More than 37,000 spectators saw Arsenal defeat Manchester United by two goals to one, and on Boxing Day a brace from Marwood ensured Arsenal beat Charlton Athletic to <b>go</b> <b>top</b> of the league table. They continued their good form on New Year's Eve, beating Aston Villa 3–0.|$|E
500|$|Using the new system, results improved. In September 1954 City beat Arsenal to <b>go</b> <b>top</b> of the league, {{though not}} without {{personal}} cost for Paul, as an elbow from Arsenal's Tommy Lawton {{resulted in the}} loss of four teeth. City could not sustain their title challenge, finishing seventh, but Paul's team enjoyed a successful run in the FA Cup, reaching the final, where they faced Newcastle United. An early goal by Jackie Milburn and an unfortunate injury to Jimmy Meadows on 18 minutes left City playing with 10 men and gave them an uphill task. Paul took the responsibility of changing tactics: [...] "Like certain generals I believe that in dire emergency it is often better to attack. I clapped my hands and yelled [...] "Let's show these Geordies the stuff that's taken us to Wembley"". The performance in the remainder of the first half was improved, resulting in an equalising goal by Bobby Johnstone, but in the second half Newcastle scored twice to win 3–1. Publicly, Paul vowed to take his team to Wembley again, but privately he blamed himself for the defeat, questioning whether he had failed as captain.|$|E
