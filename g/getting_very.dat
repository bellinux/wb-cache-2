5|$|On February 11, Neill {{left the}} Alamo, {{determined}} to recruit additional reinforcements and gather supplies. He transferred command to Travis, the highest-ranking regular army {{officer in the}} garrison. Volunteers comprised much of the garrison, and they were unwilling to accept Travis as their leader. The men instead elected Bowie, who {{had a reputation as}} a fierce fighter, as their commander. Bowie celebrated by <b>getting</b> <b>very</b> intoxicated and creating havoc in Béxar. To mitigate the resulting ill feelings, Bowie agreed to share command with Travis.|$|E
5|$|The first {{main event}} match {{of the night}} was between the World Heavyweight Champion Jack Swagger and his challenger, Big Show. Big Show {{dominated}} the match, with Swagger <b>getting</b> <b>very</b> little offense. As a result, Swagger got frustrated and hit Big Show with the World Heavyweight Championship title belt, and was disqualified. After the match, Swagger attacked Big Show with a steel chair, but Big Show was able to stop him with a chokeslam. Big Show then performed his knockout punch on Swagger, before leaving the area.|$|E
5|$|On February 3, Davy Crockett {{appeared}} with thirtyTennesseans. Neill went on furlough on February 11 {{to visit his}} sick family, leaving Travis, {{a member of the}} regular army, in command. Bowie was older than Travis with a better reputation and considered himself a colonel, thus outranking Travis, a lieutenant colonel. He refused to answer to Travis, who called an election for the men to choose their own commander. They chose Bowie, infuriating Travis. Bowie celebrated his appointment by <b>getting</b> <b>very</b> drunk and causing havoc in San Antonio, releasing all prisoners in the local jails and harassing citizens. Travis was disgusted, but twodays later the men agreed to a joint command; Bowie would command the volunteers, and Travis would command the regular army and the volunteer cavalry.|$|E

25|$|It was a {{defensive}} battle for 58 minutes, with both teams <b>getting</b> <b>very</b> {{close to the}} goal line, only to come away with field goals. Down 9–6 in the fourth quarter, the Spartans scored on a 30-yard touchdown pass from Kirk Cousins to Blair White with 1:37 left in the game. But the Hawkeyes would respond by taking the ball down the field. Finally, on 4th and goal at the 7-yard line with 2 seconds remaining, Ricky Stanzi connected with Marvin McNutt for the game-winning touchdown.|$|E
25|$|I {{know that}} some people are <b>getting</b> <b>very</b> {{defensive}} about Black Swan and my role in it, but back-stabbing is not my purpose when people ask me about the legitimacy of the dance shots in the movie. I only care to speak the truth. The truth is that no one, not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come anywhere close {{to the level of a}} professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. She is so talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in Black Swan. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit that they deserve.|$|E
500|$|By 1975, punk {{was being}} used to {{describe}} acts {{as diverse as the}} Patti Smith Group, the Bay City Rollers, and Bruce Springsteen. As the scene at New York's CBGB club attracted notice, a name was sought for the developing sound. Club owner Hilly Kristal called the movement [...] "street rock"; John Holmstrom credits Aquarian magazine with using punk [...] "to describe what was going on at CBGBs". Holmstrom, McNeil, and Ged Dunn's magazine Punk, which debuted at the end of 1975, was crucial in codifying the term. [...] "It was pretty obvious that the word was <b>getting</b> <b>very</b> popular", Holmstrom later remarked. [...] "We figured we'd take the name before anyone else claimed it. We {{wanted to get rid of}} the bullshit, strip it down to rock 'n' roll. We wanted the fun and liveliness back." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing in The Guardian, critic Anthony Berkeley Cox, writing {{under the}} name Francis Iles, noted that the two minor {{grammatical}} errors he spotted were [...] "likely to spoil no one's enjoyment" [...] of the novel as he considered that On Her Majesty's Secret Service was [...] "not only up to Mr. Fleming's usual level, but perhaps even a bit above it." [...] Writing in The Guardians sister paper, The Observer Maurice Richardson pondered {{if there had been}} [...] "a deliberate moral reformation" [...] of Bond. However, he notes Bond still has his harder side when needed. Richardson also thought that [...] "in reforming Bond Mr. Fleming has reformed his own story-telling which had been <b>getting</b> <b>very</b> loose". Overall he thought that [...] "O.H.M.S.S. is certainly the best Bond for several books. It is better plotted and retains its insane grip until the end".|$|E
500|$|According to Angelou, the book's title {{came from}} the rent parties of the 1920s and 1930s, where people would pay the host an {{inexpensive}} entry fee and then eat and drink throughout the weekend. As Angelou stated, people would [...] "sing and swing and get merry like Christmas so one would have some fuel with which to live {{the rest of the}} week". These parties, also called [...] "parlor socials", were attended by members of the working class who were unable to afford to go to Harlem's more expensive clubs. As critic Mary Jane Lupton stated, [...] "The concept of the rent party helps describe Angelou's position...She is a single mother from the South who goes to California and sings and swings for a living. She entertains others for little money as a singer, B-girl, and dancer, without <b>getting</b> <b>very</b> merry at all". Scholar Sondra O'Neale described the phrase as [...] "a folkloric title symbolic of the author's long-deserved ascent to success and fulfillment".|$|E
500|$|Rob Zombie's contribution, Werewolf Women of the SS, starred Nicolas Cage as Fu Manchu; Udo Kier as Franz Hess, {{the commandant}} of Death Camp 13; Zombie's wife, Sheri; and Sybil Danning as SS officers/sisters Eva and Gretchen Krupp (The She-Devils of Belzac). Professional wrestlers Andrew [...] "Test" [...] Martin and Oleg [...] "Vladimir Kozlov" [...] Prudius also featured, plus Olja Hrustic, Meriah Nelson, and Lorielle New as the Werewolf Women. According to Zombie, [...] "Basically, I had two ideas. It was {{either going to}} be a Nazi movie or a women-in-prison film, and I went with the Nazis. There're all those movies like Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS; Fräulein Devil; and Love Camp 7—I've always found that to be the most bizarre genre." [...] Zombie is also quoted as saying [...] "I was <b>getting</b> <b>very</b> {{conceptual}} in my own mind with it. [...] A lot of times these movies would be made like, 'Well, you know, I've got a whole bunch of Nazi uniforms, but I got this Chinese set too. We'll put 'em together!' They start jamming things in there, so I took that approach." ...|$|E

2500|$|As the Revolutionary War approached, {{members of}} the General Assembly were <b>getting</b> <b>very</b> hawkish, and when Wanton was elected for the seventh time in 1775, he refused {{to agree to the}} raising of an army of 1500 men, and would not {{commission}} new officers.

[...] While he was not overtly Loyalist, he did not see a war with Great Britain to be {{in the interest of the}} colony. [...] He retired to his home in Newport where he was undisturbed during the war, and died before its conclusion, in 1780.|$|E

(...) We even had a fake title for the film. We called it 'A Spiritual Journey'." [...] Maher continued: [...] "The hour is <b>getting</b> <b>very</b> late {{to be able to}} indulge in having key decisions made by religious people.
