5|$|Because of the {{emergence}} of MDR-TB, surgery has been re-introduced for certain cases of TB infections. It involves removal of infected chest cavities ("bullae") in the lungs {{to reduce the number of}} bacteria and to increase exposure of the remaining bacteria to antibiotics in the bloodstream. Hopes of completely eliminating TB were ended with the rise of drug-resistant strains in the 1980s. The subsequent resurgence of tuberculosis resulted in the declaration of a global <b>health</b> <b>emergency</b> by the World Health Organization in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Shilts made {{comparisons}} to the government's disparate {{reaction to the}} Chicago Tylenol murders, and the recent emergence of Legionnaire's Disease in 1977. In October 1982, seven people died after ingesting cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules. The New York Times wrote a front-page story about the Tylenol scare every day in October, and produced 33 more stories about the issue after that. More than 100 law enforcement agents, and 1,100 Food and Drug Administration employees worked on the case. Johnson & Johnson disclosed they spent $100million attempting to uncover who had tampered with the bottles. In October 1982, 634 people were reported having AIDS, and of those, 260 had died. The New York Times wrote three stories in 1981 and three more stories in 1982 about AIDS, none on the front page. The Tylenol Crisis was a criminal act of product-tampering; Legionnaire's Disease was a public <b>health</b> <b>emergency.</b> Twenty-nine members of the American Legion died in 1976 at a convention in Philadelphia. The National Institute of Health spent $34,841 per death of Legionnaire's Disease. In contrast, the NIH spent $3,225 in 1981 and about $8,991 in 1982 for each person who died of AIDS.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1960s, Flint has faced several crises.

From 1960 to 2010, {{the population of the}} city nearly halved from 196,940 to 102,434. In the mid-2000s, Flint became known for its high crime rates and has repeatedly been ranked among the most dangerous cities in the United States. The city was under a state of financial emergency from 2002–2004 and again from 2011–2015. Since 2014, the city has faced a major public <b>health</b> <b>emergency</b> due to lead poisoning in the local water supply that has affected thousands of residents, as well as an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease due to tainted water.|$|E
25|$|Public <b>Health</b> <b>Emergency</b> Preparedness {{initiatives}} are {{managed by the}} CDC via the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response. Funds aim to support communities in preparing for public health emergencies, including pandemic influenza. Also managed by the CDC, the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) consists of bulk quantities of medicines and supplies for use during such emergencies. Antiviral stockpiles prepare for shortages of antiviral medications in cases of public health emergencies. During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009-2010, guidelines for SNS use by local health departments was unclear, revealing gaps in antiviral planning. For example, local health departments that received antivirals from the SNS did not have transparent guidance {{on the use of}} the treatments. The gap made it difficult to create plans and policies for their use and future availabilities, causing delays in treatment.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Schneider began {{investigating}} asbestos-related {{deaths in}} Libby, Montana, for the P-I. His investigation found asbestos particles {{had been released}} by a closed vermiculite mine, causing contamination of workers' clothing. The mine operator, W.R. Grace and Company, was alleged to have known {{about the dangers of}} exposure to the asbestos processed at the Libby mine and failed to disclose the risks to workers and government agencies in a timely manner. The asbestos contamination, according to Schneider, had killed at least 192 people in Libby, including the wives and children of miners, and at least 375 people were diagnosed with potentially fatal diseases associated with asbestos. The release of the story, entitled [...] "Uncivil Action: A Town Left to Die", gained national attention and led to litigation against W.R. Grace and the indictment of executives on federal charges of knowing endangerment, obstruction of justice, and wire fraud after the company declared bankruptcy and illegally transferred funds and assets to new companies. The Environmental Protection Agency launched an investigation into the Libby mine after the release of the story, and later established a Superfund cleanup site in Libby, declaring in 2009 that the town was under a public <b>health</b> <b>emergency.</b>|$|E

Relief organizations scrambled to locate suitable areas for relocating evacuees on a large scale. Many of the survivors in the Superdome were bussed to the Reliant Astrodome in Houston, Texas. Houston agreed to shelter an additional 25,000 evacuees beyond those admitted to the Astrodome, including one [...] "renegade bus" [...] that was commandeered by private citizen Jabbar Gibson, who had been released on bond from the Orleans Parish Prison {{just days before the}} storm hit, and had a previous criminal conviction. By September 1, the Astrodome was declared full and could not accept any more evacuees. The George R. Brown Convention Center nearby was opened to house additional evacuees. San Antonio, Texas also agreed to house 25,000 refugees, beginning relocation efforts in vacant office buildings on the grounds of KellyUSA, a former air force base, and Reunion Arena in Dallas, Texas was mobilized to house incoming evacuees, and smaller shelters were established in towns across Texas and Oklahoma. Arkansas also opened various shelters and state parks throughout the state for evacuees.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{passage of}} laws {{requiring}} {{that all children}} receive appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment means children with special health care needs who {{are at increased risk}} for <b>health</b> <b>emergencies</b> have entered regular public classrooms. Therefore, teachers must deal not only with <b>health</b> <b>emergencies</b> of normal children, but with emergencies of children with special health care needs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of a nurse-led educational intervention for 324 teachers on their knowledge of and anxiety about management of children having <b>health</b> <b>emergencies.</b> The intervention resulted in increased knowledge and decreased anxiety about emergency response. This study demonstrated the feasi-bility and value of nurses educating teachers about school emergencies and in placing the indi-vidual health care plan into action...|$|R
