The popularity of celebrity advertising is founded upon advertiser’s belief on message credibility by well-known personalities to achieve greater attention, recall and behavioural intention among consumers. The present study assesses the impact of celebrity credibility on the underlying purchase intention of Malaysian consumers toward the footwear industry, by exploring the mediating role of attitude toward advertisement between celebrity credibility and purchase intention. The influence of <b>endorser’s</b> characteristics and cultures on consumer’s behavioural intention is explained through the applications of the Theory of Identification (Kelman, 1961, 2006) and the Meaning Transfer Model (McCracken, 1989) in this study. Descriptive findings collected from 200 potential consumers have suggested attitude toward advertisement as the catalyst of <b>endorser’s</b> identification, for cultivating dimensions of celebrity credibility (trustworthiness, expertise and attractiveness) into transactional intention. The phenomenon of integration approaches of single phenomenon, with two theoretical perspectives (Mayer & Sparrowe, 2013) is demonstrated in this product marketplace...|$|R

5|$|Another one of Bowerman's pupils, Phil Knight, {{partnered with}} Bowerman and {{revolutionized}} the sport with {{the formation of}} the shoe company giant, Nike. Knight graduated from the University of Oregon in 1959 and went on to Stanford University for graduate school. There, he developed the idea to import Japanese running shoes to the American market. After earning his MBA from Stanford, he returned to the University of Oregon where he and Bowerman struck a handshake deal in 1964, each with a $500 investment into a company called Blue Ribbon Sports to import Japanese running shoes. In the late 1960s, Bowerman's pursuit of lighter shoes for his athletes led him to develop a sole by pouring rubber into his wife's waffle iron, inventing the modern running shoe. After Knight decided to rename the company Nike and develop its own shoes, Bowerman's invention became the prototype for the company. The shoe made its debut in the 1972 Olympic Trials at Hayward Field with Steve Prefontaine as one of the early <b>endorsers.</b> Although Bowerman retired from coaching in 1972, he remained on Nike's board until 1999.

Method and Results. Using an experimental between-subjects design (N = 480) <b>endorser’s</b> attractiveness and gender were manipulated in print advertisements for four different products. Including pivotal determinants of purchasing behaviour (e. g., impression on product quality) multiple regression analysis showed that identification but not attractiveness had a small but significant incremental predictive value on purchasing behaviour.

In line with the Elaboration Likelihood Model of persuasion, the third-person perspective in the appraisal of the DTCA’s was further found to manifest particularly under conditions of the ‘peripheral cues’ of expert endorsement and milder side-effects.

40|$|The {{cultural}} lens {{through which}} an ad is viewed can affect {{the extent to which}} an endorser of the product in an ad and the message s(he) communicates are thought about in relation to one another. Consumers with a collectivist mindset tend to think about information relationally. Consequently, they consider the endorsement in relation to the endorser and this affects their memory for both. It also affects recipients' concern with the fit between the <b>endorser's</b> message and the endorser and consequently influences their judgments of both the ad and the product being advertised. When people have an individualist mindset, on the other hand, they appear to treat the endorser and the endorsement as independent pieces of information and are less sensitive to their fit. Four studies support these conclusions and provide insights into how endorser-message relatedness impacts persuasion under different cultural mindset conditions.

40|$|It {{is widely}} known that {{citizens}} use cues [...] such as party labels, polls, candidates' appearances, and endorsements [...] when making political decisions. What {{is still in}} doubt, however, is whether and under what conditions particular cues help different types of citizens to improve their decisions in different contexts. Indeed, given the multitude of cues {{that exist in the}} real world, the varied levels of sophistication among citizens, and the wide variety of situations in which citizens may find themselves, it seems unlikely that cues are equally effective for all citizens, at all times, and in all places. In my dissertation, I identify conditions under which particular cues help citizens to improve their decisions. More concretely, I assess 1) whether and under what conditions a single cue helps both sophisticated and unsophisticated citizens to improve their decisions, 2) whether and under what conditions multiple cues work better than one cue alone, and 3) whether and under what conditions citizens can learn from the statements of multiple speakers. My theoretical and empirical results show that : The statements of an endorser only improve the decisions of both sophisticated and unsophisticated citizens when the <b>endorser's</b> incentives are clear. Once the <b>endorser's</b> incentives become less transparent, this cue no longer helps citizens to improve their decisions consistently, nor does it consistently close the gap between sophisticated and unsophisticated citizens. Two cues are not necessarily better than one cue. That is, when one cue enables citizens to achieve large improvements in their decisions, the presence of a second cue does not help citizens to improve their decisions further. However, when neither cue is particularly useful by itself, these cues help citizens to make better decisions than they make with only one cue. Competition between two experts does not necessarily induce both experts to make truthful statements; thus, citizens are unable to improve their decisions under these circumstances. Indeed, competition between experts only induces truthful statements and enables the citizen to learn once it is combined with institutions. Taken together, my results demonstrate that cues are not equally effective for all citizens in all context...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} is to discover the impact that celebrity endorser has on consumers’ purchase intention through a cross-cultural exchange of celebrities {{in the field of}} marketing. The strategy of using celebrities to endorse a brand or product has been used by the marketers for decades now. The ultimate popularity of this method can be explained by witnessing the presence of an international celebrity face in every second advertisement seen on television or billboards. Many researchers have written and tested this approach in the western countries. Through contemplating them as a source of origin of the technique, this research aims to provide some academic literature in a country like Pakistan. The thesis begins with an introduction of the topic followed by literature review that sets a foundation of the research by providing an insight to the knowledge already existent by various academicians. The framework that has been proposed on celebrity <b>endorser’s</b> country of origin and its effect on consumers’ purchase intention is base on the existing literature. The research carried out is empirical and the methodology adopted for the research is quantitative in nature. Data has been collected through an online questionnaire survey answered by 150 respondents. The results of this research came up with interesting outcomes, which contradicted to the literature that suggests celebrity <b>endorser’s</b> credibility have potential to enhance consumers’ purchase intention. The impact of the celebrities’ credibility varied among the two selected countries where Pakistani celebrity was rated as a high credible source as compared to the Indian celebrity. However, Indian celebrity endorser showed the maximum potential for creating direct brand equity by increasing consumers’ interest in purchasing the product in comparison to the Pakistani celebrity. The selection of right celebrity endorser is a critical aspect as it affects the consumers’ attitude toward the advertisement, the brand and their purchase intention. Celebrity endorsements vary with respect to different countries and the culture they practice. This research is valuable for the brand managers of domestic and international companies/brands in Pakistan as it highlights that the cross-cultural exchange of celebrities would work in their favor. This is summarized under conclusion and has set a base for future managerial implications...|$|R
