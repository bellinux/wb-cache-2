50|$|Having become lovers, Lisa and Paul visit a Museum {{to see the}} Antigone 21, a lifelike psychosculpture of Lisa. While <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> at the sculpture, Paul allows Nat Hamlin to surface. The two argue (within Paul's head) {{about which}} {{personality}} has more right to exist. Nat declares that Paul is a fictitious construct, and does not deserve to live having been made up by the doctors at the Rehab Center. Paul counters by using {{the logic of the}} court, which found Nat guilty and deserving of his punishment. The two can not agree. Hamlin quietly goes away, while Paul gains newfound confidence to control and hopefully destroy Hamlin.|$|R

5000|$|Tintoretto's Last Supper (below) {{focuses on}} light and motion, {{bringing}} {{the image to}} dramatic life. Unlike more traditional views of the Last Supper, Tintoretto depicts Heaven opening up into the room, and the angels <b>looking</b> on <b>in</b> <b>awe,</b> <b>in</b> line with the old Catholic maxim that [...] "If the angels were capable of envy, they would envy the Eucharist." ...|$|R

50|$|Porky {{receives}} a package from his uncle Pinkus. Inside {{is a tiny}} silkworm. The silkworm knits garments whenever the word sew is spoken.

The worm sews a brassiere, which Porky disposes of bashfully.|$|R

The curtain over the panes being drawn back a little he, by a very natural impulse, <b>looked</b> <b>in,</b> just as <b>he</b> made ready to turn the handle. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> without a thought, without intention, without curiosity of any sort. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> because <b>he</b> could not help <b>looking</b> <b>in.</b> <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in,</b> and discovered Mr Verloc reposing quietly on the sofa.|$|R
60|$|Wilfrid {{stood still}} with astonishment as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> at the door, which Mr. Atherton had himself opened in {{response}} to his knock.|$|R

While the Prince hates the work in the garden and is always being punished, Peter is enamored and loves tending to and watching the presents he planted grow.|$|R
