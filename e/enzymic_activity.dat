40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{of data from}} in vitro studies was performed to identify the key <b>enzymic</b> <b>activities</b> in feed enzyme additives, and their dose rates, that improve degradation of alfalfa hay and corn silage. All studies were conducted in our laboratory using similar in vitro procedures and all enzyme assays used the same conditions (pH 6. 0 and temperature 39 °C) and substrates. Data from 8 research studies with 83 enzyme treatments using 45 enzyme products were summarized for alfalfa hay, and data from 6 research studies with 61 enzyme treatments using 23 enzyme products were included for corn silage. Added endoglucanase, exoglucanase, xylanase and protease activity, in addition to endoglucanase:xylanase ratio, {{were included in the}} analyses as candidate key <b>enzymic</b> <b>activities.</b> Incremental gas production (IGP) and improvement of dry matter degradability (IDMD) and neutral detergent fibre degradability (INDFD) were included as response variables. Initially, relationships between added <b>enzymic</b> <b>activities</b> and response variables were determined by linear regression analysis. Then, a mixed model analysis accounting for the random effect of study and linear and quadratic effects of added <b>enzymic</b> <b>activities</b> was used to describe the relationships. For alfalfa hay, simple linear regression analysis showed low, but significant, relationships between IGP and added endoglucanase, xylanase or exoglucanase (r 2 ≤ 0. 09, P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with no relationships between <b>enzymic</b> <b>activities</b> and IDMD or INDFD. In contrast, mixed model analysis showed a positive linear relationship (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) between IGP and added protease activity (r 2 = 0. 50) and between INDFD and exoglucanase activity (r 2 = 0. 75). For corn silage, simple linear regressions showed low, but positive relationships (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), for IDMD with endoglucanase (r 2 = 0. 08), exoglucanase (r 2 = 0. 12), or endoglucanase:xylanase ratio (r 2 = 0. 23) and for INDFD with added endoglucanase (r 2 = 0. 09), exoglucanase (r 2 = 0. 34), endoglucanase:xylanase ratio (r 2 = 0. 08), and protease (negative effect, r 2 = 0. 06). Mixed model analysis confirmed linear relationships (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with these activities, but improved predictions (IDMD: R 2 = 0. 39 – 0. 49; INDFD: R 2 = 0. 36 – 0. 56). For both forages, quadratic effects of added <b>enzymic</b> <b>activities</b> only marginally improved the prediction equations in most cases. Overall, added activities of exoglucanase had the strongest, positive, association with fibre degradation for both forages...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{properties of}} carbohydrate metabolism are being studied. The present contribution focuses mainly on those processes involving {{the transfer of}} carbon fragments among sugars. It is shown how enzymatic activities fix {{the way the system}} self-organizes stoichiometrically at the steady state. It is proven that there exists a specific correspondence between the set of all possible <b>enzymic</b> <b>activities,</b> the activity set, and the set of stoichiometrically compatible flux distributions through the pathway. On the one hand, there are <b>enzymic</b> <b>activities</b> that do not allow a stoichiometrically feasible coupling at the steady state of the reactions involved in the conversion. On the other hand, there are <b>enzymic</b> <b>activities</b> that are related to one or more flux distributions at the steady state (i. e. with one or several rate vectors respectively). For this latter group, it can be demonstrated that the structure of the system depends on other non-structural factors, such as boundary constraints and the kinetic parameters. As a consequence, it is suggested that this kind of metabolic process must be viewed as a complex reaction network instead of a sequential number of steps. Some implications of these derivations are illustrated for the particular conversion of CO 2 [...] > C 3. General remarks are also discussed within the framework of network models of cell metabolism...|$|R

5000|$|Kikkoman {{soy sauce}} is {{naturally}} brewed. After soaking {{in water for}} an extended period, soy beans are steamed at high temperature before they are mixed with crushed roasted wheat.

The results of amino acid analysis and sequence determination revealed that only Tyr- 7, Tyr- 70 and Tyr- 77 were modified in notexin. Modification of Tyr- 7 resulted in decreases in lethal toxicity and <b>enzymic</b> <b>activity</b> by 70. 2 % and 22. 7 % respectively. Conversely, modification of Tyr- 77 caused a 1. 8 -fold increase in <b>enzymic</b> <b>activity,</b> {{in contrast with the}} loss of 52. 5 % of lethality. A drastic decrease in lethal toxicity was observed when both Tyr- 7 and Tyr- 70 were modified, whereas the <b>enzymic</b> <b>activity</b> decreased by only 35. 8 %. Likewise, the derivative in which Tyr- 7 and Tyr- 77 were modified retained 44. 4 % of <b>enzymic</b> <b>activity,</b> but showed a marked decrease in lethal toxicity. It is obvious that modification of tyrosine residues causes a decrease in lethal toxicity of notexin, which does not directly correlate with the change in <b>enzymic</b> <b>activity.</b> On the other hand, the antigenicity of NBS derivatives remained unchanged. The modified derivatives retained their affinity for Ca 2 +, indicating that the modified tyrosine residues did not participate in Ca 2 + binding.

40|$|SUMMARY A {{spectrophotometric}} method using umbelliferone derivatives {{has been developed}} {{for the study of}} <b>enzymic</b> <b>activities</b> of mycobacteria. Arylsulphatase activity can be estimated in six hours rather than in 10 days as in the conventional method. The technique may be applied to a study of whole cells or to cell-free extracts. Mycobacteria, even the so-called rapidly growing strains, have, in comparison with many other bacterial genera, a slow growth rate and a corre-spondingly slow rate of metabolism. Although a few fairly rapid semiquantitative tests are available, for example, tests of amidase activity (Bonicke, 1962), most of these tests are usefully applicable only to rapidly growing mycobacteria. There is a need for a rapid, sensitive, and quantitative test system for the determination of a number of <b>enzymic</b> <b>activities</b> of both whole mycobacteria and cell-free extracts. 4 -Methyl umbelliferone fluoresces intensely in ultraviolet (UV) light and causes a corresponding absorption of UV at 360 nm. This property enables <b>enzymic</b> <b>activities</b> to be assayed by measuring the liberation of the umbelliferone from umbelliferone-linked substrates in a fluorimeter or spectrophoto-meter. Maddocks and Greenan (1975) have devised a simple spot test for the presence of various enzymes in Escherichia coli using commercially available umbelliferone-linked substrates. In this study, the feasibility of using such substrates for the quantita-tion of mycobacterial enzyme activity is investi-gated. For the development of the technique, aryl-sulphatase activity has been principally studied because this enzyme (Whitehead et al., 1953) has been widely used in a semiquantitative test for the differentiation of mycobacteria...|$|R

40|$|Lysine-oxoglutarate reductase and saccharopine {{dehydrogenase}} are <b>enzymic</b> <b>activities</b> that catalyse {{the first}} two steps of lysine degradation through the saccharopine pathway in upper eukaryotes. This paper describes the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone encoding a bifunctional enzyme bearing domains corresponding to these two <b>enzymic</b> <b>activities.</b> We partly purified those activities from mouse liver and showed {{for the first time}} that both a bifunctional lysine-oxoglutarate reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase and a monofunctional saccharopine dehydrogenase are likely to be present in this organ.

The 2. 4 kb short transcript probably codes for the monofunctional dehydrogenase. Sequence analyses show that the bifunctional enzyme is likely to be a mitochondrial protein.

These results indicate that alpha-galactosidase I is a monomeric protein and that both <b>enzymic</b> <b>activities</b> associated with the enzyme reside on the same polypeptide chain...|$|R
40|$|The {{induction}} of the glutathione S-transferases by phenobarbital and polycyclic hydrocarbons was {{studied in}} {{male and female}} rats. Administration of phenobarbital resulted in 60 - 80 % increase in S-aryl and S-aralkyl enzyme specific activities, whereas the S-epoxide and S-alkyl activities were increased by 30 - 40 %. In following the sequence of induction, the former two activities were noted to reach peak activities before {{an increase in the}} latter two activities was observed. Both 3 -methylcholanthrene and 3, 4 -benzopyrene were shown toi nduce these four <b>enzymic</b> <b>activities,</b> although without the discrimination between pairs of activities noted with phenobarbital. No change in Km accompanied the increase in Vmax. after induction by drugs, and no change occurred in Ki for sulphobromophthalein inhibition. Significantly lower enzyme specific activities were found for three of the activities studied in female rats but no difference was observed in the S-alkyltransferase activity. However, the proportional increase in the <b>enzymic</b> <b>activities</b> in response to phenobarbital was the same in males and females. These studies demonstrate the drug induction of a group of cytosolic drug-metabolizing enzymes as well as the identification of sex differences in these activities...|$|R
