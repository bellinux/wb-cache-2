5|$|His {{youthful}} {{love for}} the fairy-tale element in Shakespeare prefigured his later expressions of Catholic liturgy. Messiaen {{was not interested in}} depicting aspects of theology such as sin; rather <b>he</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> the theology of joy, divine love and redemption.|$|E
5|$|Hand still {{regarded}} {{his main}} job as judging. As circuit leader, {{he sought to}} free himself and his judges from too great an administrative burden. <b>He</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> maintaining good relations with his fellow judges and on cleansing the court of patronage appointments. Despite the Manton case and constant friction {{between two of the}} court's judges, Charles Edward Clark and Jerome Frank, the Second Circuit under Hand earned {{a reputation as one of}} the best appeal courts in the country's history.|$|E

5|$|In March 1922, Prokofiev {{moved with}} his mother {{to the town of}} Ettal in the Bavarian Alps, where for over a year <b>he</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> an opera project, The Fiery Angel, based on the novel by Valery Bryusov. His later music had {{acquired}} a following in Russia, and he received invitations to return there, but decided to stay in Europe. In 1923, Prokofiev married the Spanish singer Carolina Codina (1897–1989, stage name Lina Llubera) before moving back to Paris.|$|E
5|$|The {{criticism}} {{did little}} to dissuade Etty from attempting to reproduce the success of Cleopatra, and <b>he</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages.|$|E
5|$|When {{the conservatives}} lost the Impeachment case, {{there was a}} change of {{government}} and the charges against Hol were dropped. Two years later, he received an economic compensation from the Parliament. After some quiet years in which <b>he</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> engineering work, Hol returned to politics {{as a member of}} the city council of Skien, representing the local temperance movement. He stood for parliamentary election twice, without success.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements, Reshef {{focused on}} clearing the Tirtur Road. He left {{a battalion of}} around 30 tanks between the junction and {{the western part of}} the Chinese Farm, and prepared to attack with two armored battalions provided by Sharon. <b>He</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> the section of the Tirtur Road defended by an Egyptian battalion forming the left flank of the 16th Infantry Brigade. One of Reshef's battalions attacked from the north-east, the other from the west. The Egyptian battalion managed to halt the advance, aided by fire from tanks and anti-tank weapons on the slopes of Missouri, a hill north-west of the Chinese Farm, causing Reshef to break off his attack.|$|E
5|$|Although Shaw's works since The Apple Cart {{had been}} {{received}} without great enthusiasm, his earlier plays were revived in the West End throughout the Second World War, starring such actors as Edith Evans, John Gielgud, Deborah Kerr and Robert Donat. In 1944 nine Shaw plays were staged in London, including Arms and the Man with Ralph Richardson, Laurence Olivier, Sybil Thorndike and Margaret Leighton in the leading roles. Two touring companies took his plays all round Britain. The revival in his popularity did not tempt Shaw {{to write a}} new play, and <b>he</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> prolific journalism. A second Shaw film produced by Pascal, Major Barbara (1941), was less successful both artistically and commercially than Pygmalion, partly because of Pascal's insistence on directing, {{to which he was}} unsuited.|$|E
5|$|During {{his later}} {{creative}} years, Rodin's work turned increasingly toward the female form, and themes of more overt masculinity and femininity. <b>He</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> small dance studies, and produced numerous erotic drawings, sketched {{in a loose}} way, without taking his pencil from the paper or {{his eyes from the}} model. Rodin met American dancer Isadora Duncan in 1900, attempted to seduce her, and the next year sketched studies of her and her students. In July 1906, Rodin was also enchanted by dancers from the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, and produced some of his most famous drawings from the experience.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, after a one-month {{university}} trip to Tours, France, Ebner {{began studying}} Romance languages, German philology, and translation at the University of Vienna. At {{this time he}} was already working for a literary circle and Viennese literature magazine. After graduation in 1988 and 1989 <b>he</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> various professional careers, such as translation, foreign language teaching and IT projects. In the 1990s, Ebner published articles and books on software and networking topics; while these books were written in German, he also wrote some articles in English. In 1999, he spent six weeks in North Carolina, and was the co-author of a book in English about PC servers.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 the {{situation}} was further complicated when MGM/UA was sold to Qintex, which wanted to then merge with Pathé Communications; the Bond back catalogue was leased to Pathé at a lower-than-market value, without consulting Danjaq – who sued MGM/UA Communications, which was itself {{the target of a}} failed takeover bid by Pathé. In August 1990 Albert Broccoli appointed his daughter Barbara Broccoli alongside Michael G. Wilson as producers at Eon, while <b>he</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> matters at Danjaq. The dispute between Danjaq and MGM/UA was protracted and delayed production of Bond 17, but was finally settled in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The summer {{transfer}} {{window at}} Real Sociedad saw {{the arrival of}} Alonso's childhood friend Mikel Arteta. Arteta was ecstatic {{at the prospect of}} partnering Alonso in midfield but his excitement was short lived. Alonso was not picked for Real Sociedad's pre-season friendlies, signalling that an offer by Liverpool was being treated seriously. The Basque side announced on 20 August 2004 that they had made a deal worth £10.7million with Liverpool and Alonso had agreed terms with the Merseyside team. Alonso did not lament the fact that a move to Real Madrid had not materialised. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> integrating with the new Spanish contingent at Liverpool under the guidance of former Valencia manager Rafael Benítez.|$|E

5|$|Bernhard Mahler {{supported}} his son's ambitions for a music career, and {{agreed that the}} boy should try for {{a place at the}} Vienna Conservatory. The young Mahler was auditioned by the renowned pianist Julius Epstein, and accepted for 1875–76. He made good progress in his piano studies with Epstein and won prizes {{at the end of each}} of his first two years. For his final year, 1877–78, <b>he</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> composition and harmony under Robert Fuchs and Franz Krenn. Few of Mahler's student compositions have survived; most were abandoned when he became dissatisfied with them. He destroyed a symphonic movement prepared for an end-of-term competition, after its scornful rejection by the autocratic director Joseph Hellmesberger on the grounds of copying errors. Mahler may have gained his first conducting experience with the Conservatory's student orchestra, in rehearsals and performances, although it appears that his main role in this orchestra was as a percussionist.|$|E
5|$|Following the Austrian Grand Prix on 16 July, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at three circuits from 18–21 July {{to prepare for}} the Grand Prix. McLaren, Benetton, Jordan, Jaguar, Sauber and BAR went to Silverstone over three days. Olivier Panis, McLaren's test driver, set the fastest time {{on the first day of}} testing. Jaguar test driver Luciano Burti crashed at Stowe corner where his car's suspension, front and rear wings, and sidepod were damaged. The resulting incident caused a brief halt to testing and Jaguar shipped a spare car for the next day's testing. Panis remained fastest on the second day. Trulli damaged his suspension and rear wing, resulting in repairs which limited his team's testing time. Burti suffered another incident when he lost his right rear wheel. Fisichella topped the third and final day's running. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent four days at the Fiorano Circuit where <b>he</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> testing engine and aerodynamic development whilst Michael Schumacher did practice starts and component testing on the fourth day.|$|E
5|$|Froome {{had shown}} his form {{during the season}} with overall {{victories}} at the Vuelta a Andalucía and the Critérium du Dauphiné, a race {{considered to be the}} warm-up for the Tour. Contador had earlier in the season won the Giro d'Italia and was aiming to become the first rider since Marco Pantani in 1998 to achieve the Giro-Tour double. He was also aiming to hold all three Grand Tour titles simultaneously, having won the 2014 Vuelta a España. Thirteen days {{before the start of the}} Tour, Contador won the Route du Sud, defeating Quintana by seventeen seconds. Quintana placed second in the 2013 Tour, winning the mountains and young rider classifications. He was absent in 2014 as <b>he</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> the Giro d'Italia, which he won. His major victory of the 2015 season was the Tirreno–Adriatico. The defending champion Nibali was considered a contender, although his best result of the season was tenth in the Tour de Romandie, and placed thirteenth at the Dauphiné.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{publication}} of his memoirs, Chaplin began work on A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), a romantic comedy based on a script he had written for Paulette Goddard in the 1930s. Set on an ocean liner, it starred Marlon Brando as an American ambassador and Sophia Loren as a stowaway found in his cabin. The film differed from Chaplin's earlier productions in several aspects. It was his first to use Technicolor and the widescreen format, while <b>he</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> directing and appeared on-screen only in a cameo role as a seasick steward. He also signed a deal with Universal Pictures and appointed his assistant, Jerome Epstein, as the producer. Chaplin was paid $600,000 director's fee as well {{as a percentage of the}} gross receipts. A Countess from Hong Kong premiered in January 1967, to unfavourable reviews, and was a box-office failure. Chaplin was deeply hurt by the negative reaction to the film, which turned out to be his last.|$|E
5|$|While in college, West {{hoped to}} play both {{baseball}} and football. However, spring practice for football interfered with West's {{ability to be}} on the baseball team as well. <b>He</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> football and umpired high school baseball games on the side. In his three seasons at Elon, West was the starting quarterback and the team won three conference championships. He was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) on the 1973 team that lost the Division I National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics title game to Abilene Christian; the Abilene Christian team was led by future professional football players Clint Longley and Wilbert Montgomery. West left Elon holding three passing records that were not broken for 20 years, and was inducted into the Elon Sports Hall of Fame in 1986, in the same class as former North Carolina State women's basketball coach Kay Yow.|$|E
