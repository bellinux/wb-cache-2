5|$|A {{population-based}} study {{completed by}} the National Alcohol Research Center {{found that women who}} identify as lesbian or bisexual are less likely to abstain from alcohol. Lesbians and bisexual women have a higher likelihood of reporting problems with alcohol, as well as not being satisfied with treatment <b>for</b> <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> programs. Many lesbian communities are centered in bars, and drinking is an activity that correlates to community participation for lesbians and bisexual women.|$|E
5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, {{emergency}} medicine can {{also play a}} significant role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling <b>for</b> <b>substance</b> <b>abuse,</b> and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the first line of defense in disaster scenarios.|$|E
5|$|The book {{contains}} {{content from}} twenty-nine contributors, including psychologists, counselors, {{teachers and school}} therapists. It also includes content from Brown and Logan. General topics discussed in the work include family, alcohol abuse, relationships, self-esteem, sex and gender, and personality. Specific topics {{in the field of}} psychology include clinical psychology, cognition, abnormal psychology, evolutionary psychology, gambling addiction, Pavlovian conditioning and family therapy. Contributor Denis M. McCarthy, assistant {{professor of psychology at the}} University of Missouri, analyzes risk factors for alcoholism presented in The Simpsons.

The competencies also apply to allied professionals (e. g., primary health care providers, enforcement officials, Elders, volunteers, and social workers) interacting with individuals who have <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> issues.

The goal of this project—comprised of Technical Competencies <b>for</b> Canada’s <b>Substance</b> <b>Abuse</b> Workforce, Behavioural Competencies <b>for</b> Canada’s <b>Substance</b> <b>Abuse</b> Workforce, and supporting tools—is to enhance professionalism in the field by providing resources to: •	identify knowledge and skill sets <b>for</b> the <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> workforce and allied professionals •	support employers in hiring, retention, and staff development •	assist educators and trainers in developing strategies for learning •	provide Canadians with a more consistent quality of service delivery from the <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> workforce...|$|R
25|$|Because of {{the high}} {{frequency}} of American Indian alcoholism, a stereotype {{has been applied to}} all American Indians. As with most groups, the incidence of substance abuse is related to issues of poverty and mental distress, both of which may be, in part, the result of racial stereotyping and discrimination. Treatment <b>for</b> <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> by Native Americans is more effective when it is community-based, and addresses the issues of cultural identification.|$|E

They also introduced new methods to motivate clients and worked with them to develop long-term goals for their care. Although the studies conducted by these initiatives did not have control groups, their results were promising and became the basis for more rigorous efforts to study and develop models of integrated treatment.|$|E

However, he injured a hamstring in training, delaying his comeback until West Coast's home game against Sydney on 21 July at Subiaco Oval. He gained 38 disposals and six marks in the game, inspiring West Coast's win.|$|E

Clinicians assessing and treating substance abusers must establish therapeutic rapport to counter denial and other negative attitudes directed towards treatment. In addition, the clinician must determine substances used, the route of administration, dosage, and time of last use to determine the necessary {{short and long term}} treatments. An appropriate choice of treatment setting must also be determined. These settings may include outpatient facilities, partial hospitals, residential treatment centers, or hospitals. Both the immediate and long term treatment and setting is determined by the severity of dependency and seriousness of physiological complications arising from the abuse.|$|E

On August 24, the Browns acquired center Lennie Friedman from the Chicago Bears for a conditional 2007 draft choice.

25|$|After Osbourne {{left the}} Betty Ford Center {{where he had}} been treated <b>for</b> <b>substance</b> <b>abuse,</b> Lee {{presented}} him with the music he had written while Osbourne was away. Osbourne was purportedly very satisfied with {{the quantity and quality of}} Lee's new music, much of which would be used for the 1986 album, The Ultimate Sin. The album was awarded platinum status in May 1986 and was awarded double platinum status in October 1994. Lee and Osbourne once again toured extensively, this time with Phil Soussan on bass, John Sinclair on keyboards and Randy Castillo on drums. In Kansas City, Missouri on April 1, 1986, a concert was filmed which would be released later that year as the home video The Ultimate Ozzy. In 1987, after touring with Ozzy Osbourne in support of The Ultimate Sin album, Lee was fired in a telegram from Sharon Osbourne while working on one of his muscle cars back in Los Angeles. Lee was completely caught off guard at the time of his firing and was under the impression he had a solid working gig with the Osbourne camp.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance {{occurs to}} the muscle-relaxant, anticonvulsant, and sleep-inducing effects of benzodiazepines, and upon {{cessation}} a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome occurs. This {{can lead to}} benzodiazepines being taken for longer than originally intended, as people continue to take the drugs {{over a long period}} of time to suppress withdrawal symptoms. Some people abuse benzodiazepines at very high doses and devote a lot of time to doing so, satisfying the diagnostic criteria in DSM IV <b>for</b> <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> and dependence. Another group of people include those on low to moderate therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines who do not abuse their benzodiazepines but develop a tolerance and benzodiazepine dependence. A considerable number of individuals using benzodiazepines for insomnia escalate their dosage, sometimes above therapeutically-prescribed dose levels. Tolerance to the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines has been clearly demonstrated in rats. In humans, there is little evidence that benzodiazepines retain their anti-anxiety effects beyond four months of continuous treatment; there is evidence that suggests that long-term use of benzodiazepines may actually worsen anxiety, which in turn may lead to dosage escalation, with one study finding 25% of patients escalated their dosage. Some authors, however, consider benzodiazepines to be effective long-term; however, it is more likely that the drugs are acting to prevent rebound anxiety withdrawal effects. Tolerance to the anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxing effects of benzodiazepines occurs within a few weeks in most patients.|$|E
