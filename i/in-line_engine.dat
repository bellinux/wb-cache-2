5|$|The RLM {{was still}} not {{interested}} in the Ju 87 and was not impressed that it relied on a British engine. In late 1935, Junkers suggested fitting a DB 600 <b>in-line</b> <b>engine,</b> with the final variant to be equipped with the Jumo 210. This was accepted by the RLM as an interim solution. The reworking of the design began on 1 January 1936. The test flight could not be carried out for over two months {{due to a lack of}} adequate aircraft. The 24 January crash had already destroyed one machine.|$|E

25|$|In 1929, Menasco {{designed}} his own engine, the 4-A, {{the first}} of what was to become Menasco's main product line, the inverted, <b>in-line</b> <b>engine.</b> Menasco designed and built a variety of four- and six-cylinder inverted air-cooled aircraft engines, some with supercharging.|$|E
25|$|The Miles M.15 {{was built}} in {{response}} to Air Ministry specification T.1/37 which called for a two-seat basic trainer. Two other aircraft manufacturers also built contenders: Parnall Aircraft provided the Heck 3 and Heston Aircraft their Heston T.1/37. The Airspeed AS.36, General Aircraft GAL.32 and Percival P.20 were also proposed against specification T.1/37, but not built. At first sight, the M.15 looked rather like the earlier Miles Magister, a low cantilever wing monoplane with tandem open cockpits and a fixed, spatted main undercarriage plus tailwheel, powered by a single inverted de Havilland Gipsy series <b>in-line</b> <b>engine.</b> Despite this, the two types differed significantly in powerplant, form and construction.|$|E
500|$|These {{problems}} {{were to be}} resolved by installing the Daimler-Benz DB 600 engine, but delays in development forced {{the installation of the}} Jumo 210 Da <b>in-line</b> <b>engine.</b> Flight testing began on 14 August 1936. Subsequent testing and progress fell short of Richthofen's hopes, although the machine's speed was increased to [...] at ground level and [...] at , while maintaining its good handling ability.|$|E
50|$|The {{favourable}} {{power-to-weight ratio}} of the rotaries was their greatest advantage. While larger, heavier aircraft relied almost exclusively on conventional <b>in-line</b> <b>engines,</b> many fighter aircraft designers preferred rotaries {{right up to the}} end of the war.|$|R
50|$|In mid-1935 Lockheed's chief engineer, Hall Hibbard, began {{discussing}} with Al Menasco, {{the president}} of the Menasco Motors Company in Burbank, the merits of coupling two Menasco C6S Super Buccaneer six-cylinder <b>in-line</b> <b>engines</b> mounted side-by-side, driving a single propeller.|$|R
50|$|The Iris {{cars were}} luxury {{vehicles}} with large, water-cooled four-cylinder <b>in-line</b> <b>engines.</b> Between 1906 and 1908 a six-cylinder 40 HP was available, {{but it is}} probable that only one unit was built. A striking feature of all models was the diamond shaped radiator grille.|$|R

The R-3 was an experimental tug for gliders and had an expanded radio system so the crew could communicate with the glider crew by way of the tow rope. The R-4 differed from the R-2 in the Jumo 211J powerplant.|$|E

2500|$|The Bleriot 111 was a low-wing single-engined {{monoplane}} with {{an enclosed}} passenger cabin {{and an open}} cockpit for the pilot forward of the cabin. The first variant was the Bleriot 111/1 which first flew on 24 January 1929 powered by a [...] Hispano-Suiza 6Mbr 6-cyl. water-cooled <b>in-line</b> <b>engine.</b> In October 1929 a second variant flew (known as the 111bis or 111/2) which had a modified landing gear. The 111/2 was re-engined with a [...] Gnome & Rhône 9Ady radial engine and re-designated 111/3. The 111/3 was flown {{as part of the}} Patrouille Blériot which gave exhibitions and demonstrations around France and Spain in the 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was flat}} sided, with a conventional rounded decking running forward {{as far as}} the engine cowling. [...] It tapered to the rear, more in plan than elevation and carried a tailplane with a sharply swept leading edge mounted on top of the fuselage and externally braced from below. [...] The elevators were more rounded, and well separated to allow rudder movement. The fin and horn balanced rudder together were almost triangular, with the latter rounded at tip and base. [...] The rear cockpit was over the trailing edge of the wing and the front cockpit at the leading edge. [...] The Trainer was powered by a 90hp (67kW) Blackburn Cirrus Minor four cylinder inverted <b>in-line</b> <b>engine,</b> driving a two-bladed propeller.|$|E
2500|$|The SM.80 also flew with a 112kW (150hp) CNA C.VI six-cylinder <b>in-line</b> <b>engine.</b> [...] The third aircraft, {{registered}} in 1934, was more radically re-engined; a four-seater, {{it was named}} the SM.80bis. [...] This is powered by two pusher configuration, 56kW (75hp) seven-cylinder radials Pobjoy R engines, placed further aft than the single engine of the SM.80 but located above the wing {{on either side of}} the fuselage on very similar mountings. [...] The cabin is positioned about 950mm (2ft) further forward but otherwise the two models were structurally identical. [...] The SM.80bis was 80kg (175lb) heavier and significantly slower, with a decrease of maximum speed of (16mph), though climb rates were similar. [...] The speed decrease has been attributed to the extra drag of the twin engine arrangement, since the SM.80 and SM.80bis had the same overall engine power.|$|E
