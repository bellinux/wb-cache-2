5|$|Some {{surviving}} charters from Coenred's reign reveal him to {{have been}} the overlord of the East Saxon rulers. Offa, an East Saxon king, made a grant in the territory of the Hwicce (to which he may have been connected by a marriage of his father, Sigeheard) which was later confirmed by Coenred. In the charter, Coenred refers to Offa as his underking. Coenred and his successor also confirmed grants to Waldhere, the Bishop of London, evidence that London was firmly under Mercian overlordship. Later Mercian kings treated London as their direct possession, rather than as a province ruled by an underking, but Coenred did not <b>go</b> <b>that</b> <b>far.</b> A grant of land in Herefordshire to a nun named Feleburg has survived, as have forged charters in Coenred's name granting privileges to St Paul's Cathedral, and to the Abbey of Evesham.|$|E
5|$|Some {{members of}} the Norwegian black metal scene were {{motivated}} to take violent action against this influence – for instance, the church burnings by black metal musicians Varg Vikernes, Samoth, Faust, and Jørn Inge Tunsberg, among others. While most bands or individuals did not <b>go</b> <b>that</b> <b>far,</b> an undercurrent of racism, nationalism, and anti-Semitism continues to permeate parts of the black metal scene. Many Viking metal artists, however, including bands such as Enslaved and Einherjer, simply express interest in Vikings and Norse mythology and entirely reject the Satanic inclination of black metal, writing almost exclusively on Norse themes, without any racist or anti-Semitic undertones. Whereas black metal during the 1990s took a militant and destructive stance toward the status quo, Viking metal looked {{to the past and}} took a populist, anti-system approach which eschewed violence. Viking metal is both pre-Christian and post-apocalyptic– it looks to a pre-Christian past and imagines a post-Christian future. While opposition to Christianity drove the formation of Viking metal, some bands that play, or have played, Viking metal, such as Slechtvalk, Drottnar, and Holy Blood, subscribe to Christian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you <b>go</b> <b>that</b> <b>far</b> and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

[...] The Conservatives supported this legislation, though they later cast aspersions on it by suggesting that of the Liberals re-elected, two had never left Canada.

The NAACP issued the statement: [...] "Congratulations to Halle Berry and Denzel Washington for giving us hope and making us proud. If this is a sign that Hollywood is finally ready to give opportunity and judge performance based on skill and not on skin color then it is a good thing." [...] This role generated controversy. Her graphic nude love scene with a racist character played by co-star Billy Bob Thornton was the subject of much media chatter and discussion among African Americans. Many in the African-American community were critical of Berry for taking the part. Berry responded: [...] "I don't really see a reason to ever <b>go</b> <b>that</b> <b>far</b> again.

Accompanying this movement is a breathless pullback into a high crane shot that takes {{place at the same time}} Kelly is swinging into his widest arcs with the umbrella. The effect is dizzying. Perhaps the finest single example of the application of camera knowhow to a dance moment in Donen-Kelly canon." [...] He also complimented Donen's direction in the [...] "Moses Supposes" [...] number, including [...] "certain camera techniques which Donen had by now formularized... the dolly shot into medium shot to signify the ending of one shot and the beginning of another." [...] Although Donen credits earlier musicals by René Clair, Lubitsch and Astaire as [...] "integrated", he also states that [...] "in the early musicals of Lubitsch and Clair, they made it clear from the beginning that their characters were going to sing operatically.

[...] Jemison {{graduated from}} Stanford in 1977, receiving a B.S. in chemical engineering and fulfilling the requirements for a B.A. in African and Afro-American Studies. At Stanford, she choreographed a musical and dance production called Out of the Shadows. She took initiative to get even further involved in the black community by serving as head of the Black Students Union in college. Jemison said that majoring in engineering as a black woman was difficult because race was always an issue in the United States. [...] "Some professors would just pretend I wasn't there. I would ask a question and a professor would act as if it was just so dumb, the dumbest question he had ever heard. Then, when a white guy would ask the same question, the professor would say, 'That's a very astute observation.'" [...] In an interview with the Des Moines Register in 2008 Jemison said that it was difficult to go to Stanford at 16, but thinks her youthful arrogance may have helped her. [...] "I did have to say, 'I'm going to do this and I don't give a crap (damn).'" [...] She points out the unfairness of the necessity for women and minorities to have that attitude in some fields.|$|E

2500|$|Wilford's right hand, {{the second}} in command on the train and has been the {{spokesperson}} for Wilford for the past 17 years. About the character, Swinton said, [...] "Mason is a pretty monstrous construct so we felt {{we were dealing with}} extremes, but the truth was that we didn't have to <b>go</b> <b>that</b> <b>far.</b> Look at Hitler with his dyed black hair and Gaddafi with handmade medals stuck on his jacket." [...] Swinton prepared for the role by studying clowning politicians throughout history, and Mason is, in Swinton's words, [...] "a complete smash cut of all the monstrous, maniacal, political clowns." [...] Swinton added that the character is a mix of Margaret Thatcher, Colonel Gaddafi, Adolf Hitler and Silvio Berlusconi. The Lancashire accent Swinton uses is based on someone from her early life who had the accent and to her, [...] "was an early example of authority". Tilda and Bong met at the Cannes Film Festival when We Need to Talk About Kevin played and both wanted to work together. In one original scenario, Mason was a middle-aged man and first mentioned as [...] "peaceful", so Bong changed it and offered it to Swinton. Bong added, [...] "I originally talked to John C. Reilly about playing Mason." [...] On Mason's appearance, Bong stated, [...] "Tilda actually wanted to take the look further and I had to pull her back. She at the time really wanted to transform herself and look different than she ever looked before. I was all for it. Obviously there was something that started the whole look." [...] Additionally Swinton stated, [...] "As we were playing we had these ideas, like fantastic pendulous breasts [...] And Jamie Bell loved wearing them of course. We have a picture of him. Our crew picture involves [...] wearing Mason's breasts." [...] Bong was inspired by a photo Ondrej Nekvasil found of a lady inside the National Museum of Natural History, and he showed the image to Tilda who [...] "loved it". The appearance of Mason was based on Roxie Collie Laybourne.|$|E
2500|$|Australia {{had less}} need than England to {{increase}} the scoring rate as a draw would save the Ashes, but the burden of batting last meant that they should overhaul England's total by 50 runs because {{of the danger of}} being spun out on the last day. Bill Lawry and Bobby Simpson looked keen enough with 28 runs in the first half hour even though Fred Trueman hit Simpson on the shoulder with a beamer. He had Lawry caught behind for 12 and welcomed Brian Booth with a bouncer and a yorker that nearly bowled him, followed by a lbw appeal from Brian Statham. After this it was the turn of the spinners Fred Titmus and David Allen who bowled 90 over between them in the innings at a rate of 16-17 an hour and with great accuracy. Titmus bowled Booth in his second over, appealed for leg before wicket against Norm O'Neill before he had scored and had Simpson caught by Trueman at leg-slip to give him 2/10 off 8 overs and to leave Australia 71/3. Neil Harvey had been lowered down the order because of his bruise finger and Peter Burge came out for a few minutes before play ended at 5:38 pm. In the Sunday press conference Ted Dexter thought that England would {{have a good chance of}} winning and that three days would be enough to force a win, a minority view. On the Monday morning O'Neill was full of confidence after his century at Adelaide and refused to be tied town, or to submit to the flat wicket. He struck 6 fours in the morning session, and Burge 3, compared to the miserly 3 boundaries made on Saturday. He cause was helped by England's shoddy fielding, wicket-keeper Alan Smith failed to stump O'Neill off Allen on 70 and dropped Burge off Statham on 63. O'Neill went after lunch, driving Allen into the outstretched hand of Tom Graveney at short mid-on for 73, having added 109 with Burge. This brought Neil Harvey to the crease in his farewell Test on his home ground to great applause and welcomed by the England team, as was Alan Davidson. Rain now interfered with play and there were two 20–25 minutes breaks, which upset his concentration, even so he added 51 with Burge before being caught by the substitute fielder Peter Parfitt off Statham (1/76) for 22, Colin Cowdrey being off the field with an eye infection and Trueman was off with a strained thigh. Dexter (1/24) [...] tried to bowl around the wicket to Davidson, who had tried to have the sightscreen moved over, only to find that it could not <b>go</b> <b>that</b> <b>far</b> to the left, so Dexter went back to bowling over the wicket, but the palaver had unsettled the batsman and he holed out to Allen. Richie Benaud hit a Dexter bouncer to the boundary and dominated the strike for the last two overs to make 13 not out, leaving Burge on 98 and Australia 285/5, still 36 runs behind. Burge took four overs to reach his hundred the next morning, in slower time than Barrington, and was lbw trying to sweep Titmus for 103. Garth McKenzie was caught and bowled by Titmus, but Neil Hawke hung on for an hour adding 44 with Benaud (57) before they were both caught by Graveney to give Titmus 5/103 off 47.2 overs and Allen 2/87 off 43 overs. The Australians were not riled so much by the crowd as the English batsmen had been, partly as O'Neill and Benaud had been making strokes, but also by the interest in seeing whether they could lead in the first innings. This they did, a total of 349 giving a slim lead of 28 runs.|$|E
