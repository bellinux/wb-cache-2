30|$|A fatigue {{analysis}} method and procedure are established for analyzing fatigue <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> deepwater test strings subjected to wave action. The {{results show that}} the fatigue <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> the deepwater test string fluctuates with the water depth, and damage varies considerably with position. The <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> the sections adjacent to the splash zone and the lower flex joint are much greater. The fatigue <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> the deepwater test string tends to increase as the top tension decreases and with wave height. Moreover, the <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> the flex joint areas is sensitive to the top tension, whereas the <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> the upper sections of the test string is sensitive to the wave height.|$|R
