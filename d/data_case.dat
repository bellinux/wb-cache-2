40|$|First-order {{logic is}} the {{traditional}} basis for knowledge representation languages. However, its applicability to many real-world tasks is limited by its inability to represent uncertainty. Bayesian belief networks, on the other hand, are inadequate for complex KR tasks due to the limited expressivity of the underlying (prepositional) language. The need to incorporate uncertainty into an expressive language {{has led to a}} resurgence of work on first-order probabilistic Logic. This paper addresses one of the main objections to the incorporation of probabilities into the language: &quot;Where do the numbers come from? &quot; We present an approach that takes a knowledge base in an expressive rule-based first-order language, and leams the probabilistic parameters associated with those rules from <b>data</b> <b>cases.</b> Our approach, which is based on algorithms for learning in traditional Bayesian networks, can handle <b>data</b> <b>cases</b> where many of the relevant aspects of the situation are unobserved. It is also capable of utilizing a rich variety of <b>data</b> <b>cases,</b> including instances with varying causal structure, and even involving a varying number of individuals. These features allow the approach to be used {{for a wide range of}} tasks, such as learning genetic propagation models or learning first-order STRIPS planning operators with uncertain effects. ...|$|R

Likewise, interviews and surveys of flight controllers indicate that mission teams are commonly concerned with team member coordination and communications, and that interpersonal conflicts and tensions do exist.|$|E

40|$|Restricted maximum {{likelihood}} {{was used to}} estimate variance and covariance components in a multiple trait unequal information setting. Estimates were obtained by two forms of an expectation maximization algorithm and a third shortcut algorithm, which uses expectation maximization for the within component and the 2 ̆ 2 method of scoring 2 ̆ 2 for the between sire component. Eleven data sets were simulated to establish the behavior of each algorithm {{under a variety of}} conditions. The shortcut algorithm converged uniformly faster than both expectation maximization algorithms. Priors close to the converged values were more helpful in reducing the number of iterations for the expectation maximization algorithms than the shortcut algorithm. Starting iteration with unknown covariances was more detrimental than values for the covariances which were one-half, twice, or three times the values at convergence, especially for the expectation maximization algorithms;Dairy Herd Improvement data from the Northeastern United States were analyzed. Data were 49, 918 cows with mature equivalent 305 d milk yield (trait 1) and number of services (trait 2), of which 15, 656 also had number of services as heifers (trait 3). Two separate analyses were conducted to study the effect of the unequal number of traits per cow. The missing <b>data</b> <b>case</b> included all cows, with or without number of services as heifers, and the equal <b>data</b> <b>case</b> included only cows with number of services as a heifer and cow. The model included fixed herd-year-seasons, random sires and error. There were 352 sires in the missing <b>data</b> <b>case</b> and 327 in the equal <b>data</b> <b>case.</b> Sires were assumed to be unrelated. Estimates of heritabilities, and genetic and error correlations for the equal <b>data</b> <b>case</b> were: h[subscript]sp 12 =. 14, h[subscript]sp 22 =. 02, h[subscript]sp 32 =. 01, r[subscript] g 12 =. 59, r[subscript] g 13 =. 07, r[subscript] g 23 =. 68, r[subscript] e 12 =. 15, r[subscript] e 13 =. 00, r[subscript] e 23 =. 03; and h[subscript]sp 12 =. 22, h[subscript]sp 22 =. 02, h[subscript]sp 32 =. 01, r[subscript] g 12 =. 30, r[subscript] g 13 = -. 24, r[subscript] g 23 =. 43, r[subscript] e 12 =. 15, r[subscript] e 13 =. 00, r[subscript] e 23 =. 03 for the missing <b>data</b> <b>case.</b> Parameter estimates changed by accounting for missing traits.

Given complete data, we describe the simple problem of single parameter learning for intuition and then expand to belief networks under appropriate system decomposition.
