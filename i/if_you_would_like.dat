25|$|The pink {{sandstone}} {{sculptures of}} Mathura evolved during the Gupta period (4th to 6th century) {{to reach a}} very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. Newer sculptures in Afghanistan, in stucco, schist or clay, display very strong blending of Indian post-Gupta mannerism and Classical influence, Hellenistic or possibly even Greco-Roman. Meanwhile, elsewhere in India, less anatomically accurate styles of human representation evolved, leading to the classical art {{that the world is}} now familiar with, and contributing to Buddhist and Hindu sculpture throughout Asia. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> more information on this topic please let us recommend.|$|E
