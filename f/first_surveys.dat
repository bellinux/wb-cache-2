He was credited with finding major oil fields in Venezuela in 1922, in Michigan in 1927, in southern Illinois in 1936, and the Cumberland Field in Oklahoma in 1940. In 1927, he and his staff used geophysical data to find the large Van oil field in Texas, and in 1937 it was also used by him and his staff (working with Superior Oil) to find the Creole field in Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico, which was the first offshore oil well in the world in tidal waters; see also Offshore oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico and Oil platform history. He was profiled in National Petroleum News in 1929, was called [...] "one of the leading geologists of the world" [...] in a 1940 article about oil reserves, and was quoted as an [...] "authority on oil reserves" [...] in Popular Mechanics in 1944. He spoke regularly at regional and national conferences about oil discoveries.|$|E
