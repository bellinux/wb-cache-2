5|$|Braham flew in {{the first}} wave. As Braham's wave reached Leeuwarden in the Netherlands and while {{four of the five}} RAF fighters made no contact, Braham {{attracted}} two enemy night fighters. The Messerschmitt Bf 110s were from IV./Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (Night Fighter Wing 1). Five had taken off under the command of Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer—who finished the war as the most successful night fighter of all time with 121 air victories. Schnaufer led his flight out toward the echo but turned back himself after engine trouble. Using his Serrate radar detector, Braham and his radar operator picked up the emissions made by the German fighters' Lichtenstein radar. He gained on and shot down Feldwebel Georg Kraft, an Experten with 15 air victories from 4./NJG 1. Kraft was killed. Another Bf 110 had witnessed the action and attempted to engage Braham but was outmanoeuvred and dispatched also. Its pilot, Feldwebel Heinz Vinke was the only member of his crew to survive. Braham considered shooting at one crew member, likely Vinke, who he had seen parachute out of the aircraft, but Bill Gregory persuaded him not to. Braham's Beaufighter was nearly struck by debris from the last victim. Braham had a habit of opening fire at very close range and the resulting disintegration of the Messerschmitt hurled debris at the closely following Beaufighter. One reason for firing at close-range was Braham's high state of fatigue. In such a state Braham could barely keep <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open.</b> Whenever he peered ahead they smarted and misted.|$|E
25|$|July 5: Jeremiah Weinberger, 23. Met Dahmer at a gay bar in Chicago {{and agreed}} to {{accompany}} him to Milwaukee for the weekend. Dahmer drilled through Weinberger's skull and injected boiling water into the cavity. He later recalled Weinberger's death to be exceptional, as {{he was the only}} victim who died with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open.</b> Weinberger's decapitated body was kept in the bathtub for a week before being dismembered; his torso was placed in the 57-gallon drum.|$|E
500|$|At {{the rifle}} range Lody was {{strapped}} into a chair. He refused {{to have his}} eyes bandaged, as he wished to die with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open.</b> A few moments later {{the inhabitants of the}} Tower heard [...] "the muffled sound of a single volley". His body was taken away to be buried in an unmarked grave in the East London Cemetery in Plaistow. The War Office issued a terse announcement of the execution a few days later on 10 November: [...] "Sentence is duly confirmed." ...|$|E

500|$|Meeker {{had taken}} an ox team and wagon to Portland's Lewis and Clark Exposition in 1905; en route he had kept <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> for places to set up {{suitable}} monuments on the Cowlitz Trail, on which pioneers had journeyed from the Columbia River to Puget Sound. He made arrangements with locals in towns along that trail {{to raise money to}} build monuments there. He gave lectures as a fundraiser, but raised little money. He took his team and wagon for daylong shakedown trips, despite the mocking of some who remembered him as Hop King. [...] After several days camped on his lawn as practice for the trip, and then in other nearby locales, Meeker set out from Olympia on February 19, 1906.|$|E
500|$|The film {{industry}} is a subject of satire as well. For example, Japanese censorship often involved masking prohibited sections of the screen. Here Suzuki preemptively masked his own compositions but animated them and incorporated them into the film's design. In the story, after Hanada finds {{he is unable to}} kill Misako he wanders the streets in a state of confusion. The screen is obscured by animated images with accompanying sounds associated to her. The effects contributed to the eclectic visual and sound design while signifying his obsessive love. Author Stephen Teo proposed that the antagonistic relationship between Hanada and Number One may have been analogous of Suzuki's relationship with studio president Kyūsaku Hori. He compared Hanada's antagonizers to those who had been pressuring Suzuki to rein in his style over the previous two years. Teo cited Number One's sleeping with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> and urinating where he sits, which the character explains as techniques one must master to become a [...] "top professional." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goodloe came to Meadville {{even though}} he knew it was {{unlikely}} he would be ordained by a Unitarian church, because none would accept a black minister. President Southworth wrote, [...] "I find this morning in putting the possibilities squarely before him that he has come here with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> knowing that it is probably not a good way into the orthodox ministry, but ready to take the consequences." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gaye {{released}} his first single, [...] "Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide", in May 1961, with the album The Soulful Moods of Marvin Gaye, following a month later. Gaye's initial recordings failed commercially {{and he spent}} most of 1961 performing session work as a drummer for artists such as The Miracles, The Marvelettes and blues artist Jimmy Reed for $5 (US$ in [...] dollars) a week. While Gaye took some advice on performing with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> (having been accused of appearing as though he were sleeping), he refused to attend grooming school courses at the John Roberts Powers School for Social Grace in Detroit because of his unwillingness to comply with its orders, something he later regretted.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, Rudd and Dale Earnhardt swapped rides, with Rudd {{moving over}} to the No. 15 Ford for Bud Moore. Rudd was {{involved}} in a horrific crash in the Busch Clash at Daytona, in which his car went airborne (in a crash that Ned Jarrett described as something like a [...] "bucking horse") before suffering a concussion. His eyes were swollen so badly he taped <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> to be able to race in the Daytona 500. After learning of this long after the fact, NASCAR instituted the policy of examining all drivers involved in wrecks to ensure {{that they will be able}} to race safely the next week. He won his first race for this team in only his second start at Richmond and improved to seventh in points. He moved up one spot in points in the following season, and then a career-best 5th-place finish in 1986. Despite an additional 2 victories in 1987, Rudd left Moore Engineering at the end of the season.|$|E
2500|$|After Vinnie Paul slammed Superjoint Ritual, saying Anselmo {{could not}} even keep <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> Anselmo replied, [...] "I just hear a big and sad yellowbelly crybaby fuckin' knowing that his meal ticket is in a {{different}} fuckin' band... You would have to know those guys to really understand where I was coming from. They're scared of their own fuckin' shadows. And, all that said, I wish them the best of fuckin' luck. I still love 'em." [...] Anselmo had engaged in a war of words with Dimebag {{since the fall of}} Pantera, culminating in the statement [...] "Dimebag deserves to be beaten severely" [...] in the December 2004 edition of the UK's Metal Hammer magazine. Initially, he denied making the statement, but later changed his story in a VH1 Behind the Music special on Pantera, claiming that the comment had been lighthearted and made off the record. However, Vinnie Paul told the press that he had heard the audio files of the interview and that Anselmo had not been misquoted.|$|E

2500|$|Mark Ruffalo as Doctor. The doctor also becomes {{something}} of a leader; in an early scene, he reveals {{that he has been}} elected as his ward's official representative {{to the rest of the}} community. Meirelles originally sought to cast actor Daniel Craig as Doctor, but negotiations were not finalized. Ruffalo said that his character loses the illusion of his self-perspective and perceives his wife as being a person he could aspire to. Ruffalo said, [...] "That's a very difficult moment for anybody, to have all their perceptions completely shattered, but I think the Doctor finally comes to a peace about his inabilities and his downfall, and admits to an admiration for his wife's strengths." [...] The actor wore a layer of makeup to appear older and also wore contact lenses to be blind while having <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open.</b> The actor said of the experience as a blind character, [...] "At first it's terrifying and then it's frustrating and then it gets quiet... we're tormented by our eyesight... you don't know this until you go blind... As an actor I suddenly felt free." ...|$|E

50|$|According to Kirzinger, {{the hardest}} thing he went through while {{performing}} as Jason in Freddy vs. Jason (2003) was sinking into the lake. They shot the scene in a tank which was highly chlorinated and had debris {{to make it look}} like lake water. Director Ronny Yu wanted the close-up of Ken's eye and wanted him to sink into the water keeping <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>open.</b> He also could not breathe because it would be visible on film. He was lying on top of the water and had to let himself sink down to the bottom of the tank without breathing and keeping <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>open.</b> Kirzinger really held his breath, and the chlorine in the water burned <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
