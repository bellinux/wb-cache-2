40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} part of a new product design project. Its scope is the {{enhancement}} of a <b>hybrid</b> <b>boiler,</b> which is an innovative product using different energy sources (natural gas and electricity with a share of renewable energy). One of the key points in this project is to make this boiler more communicative by wiring it to an information system. This system called “Thermibox” gives us a way of monitoring boiler parameters when it works on the field in a real use case. Moreover, as a complete information system, the Thermibox could be a significant link between the products, the customer and our company which designs and manufactures the product. Within TRIZ framework, the goal {{of this study is to}} show a new way of documenting expected contradictions and finding physical and technical contradictions that were not expected while designing the product by using a smart monitoring system. The main purpose is to define a set of parameters that could have a correlation and then find how they interact by monitoring them and using algorithms taken from data mining. The system should also be able to classify the contradictions according to their frequency or their intensity and help us finding the available resources to solve them. On the one hand, this tool could give us the necessary information to design a new product as soon as we have a functional prototype, or to improve an existing one for a new version. The created information should be an adequate input to roll out the TRIZ process and work on contradictions that would have been hard to identify in the normal way. On the other hand, if the contradictions we brought to light can be formalized easily, the balance between system parameters could be used in an active way to optimize the regulation and parameterization of the product...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} comply with climate goals in the future, all {{relevant}} sectors must implement extensive decarbonisation measures. For power system models, this implies that more complex interactions of bi-and multivalent technologies in the heat, industry and transport sector have to be included. Coupled with higher shares of renewable generation, these interactions lead to significant modelling challenges for large-scale power system models. Focusing on the heat sector, this study develops two aggregation methods for representing <b>hybrid</b> <b>boilers,</b> monovalent heat pumps and CHP systems in an adequate but computationally efficient way. The performance of the aggregation methods is evaluated and compared to the disaggregated reference case in terms of result accuracy and solution time for two load scenarios. It {{has been shown that}} the proposed aggregation method 2 which is based on the heating technology efficiencies yields a sound approximation of the disaggregated reference...|$|R
40|$|A <b>hybrid</b> {{combustion}} <b>boiler</b> (100). The boiler (100) {{is characterized}} {{in that it}} comprises a hybrid atmospheric burner (10) having a catalytic element (11) crossed by a fuel-rich mixture. Between the catalytic element (11) and a heat exchanger (SC) there is a secondary air flow (F 3) introduction pipe, so as to obtain a flame (FLM) given by the ignition of the reformed gas produced when the fuel-rich mixture crosses the catalytic element (11), so that the heat transfer to the heat exchanger (SC) occurs mainly by radiation IR throughout the visible and in the near infrared spectrum...|$|R
50|$|The sole Class 20 {{locomotive}} was numbered 2485. It was a <b>hybrid,</b> with a <b>boiler</b> {{which had}} been inherited from a Class 19A locomotive {{which had been}} equipped with a Watson Standard no. 1A boiler. The driving wheels were from scrapped Class 8 locomotives. The trailing pony truck {{was similar to that}} of the Class 19C, but the leading Bissel truck was specially designed. The bar frames and cylinders were imported.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{systematically}} synthesizing hybrid controllers that satisfy multiple requirements is considered. We present a technique, {{based on the}} principles of optimal control, for determining the class of least restrictive controllers that satisfy the most important requirement (which we refer to as safety). The system performance with respect to the lower priority requirement (which we refer to as efficiency) can then be optimized within this class. We motivate our approach by three examples, one purely discrete (the problem of reachability in finite automata) one <b>hybrid</b> (the steam <b>boiler</b> problem) and one primarily continuous (a flight vehicle management system). 1 Introduction In this paper we concentrate on the problem of controlling hybrid systems, that is "steering" them using continuous and discrete inputs in an attempt to ensure that the system behavior satisfies certain requirements. For most real systems multiple requirements are imposed on the design. For example, for [...] ...|$|R

The system performance with respect to lower priority objectives (which we refer to as efficiency) can then be optimized within this class. We motivate our approach by showing how the proposed synthesis technique simplifies to well known results from supervisory control and pursuit evasion games when restricted to purely discrete and purely continuous systems respectively. We then illustrate the application of this technique to two examples, one <b>hybrid</b> (the steam <b>boiler</b> benchmark problem), and one primarily continuous (a flight vehicle management system with discrete flight modes). 1 Introduction Hybrid systems, or systems that involve the interaction of discrete and co [...] ...|$|R
