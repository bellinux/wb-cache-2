5000|$|Four SOE {{agents and}} instructors—Thor Helliessen, Jan Allan, Ruben Langmo and Johannes S. Andersen—were sent to Norway and parachuted into Nordmarka north of Oslo in October 1942. Their primary {{mission was to}} help the {{resistance}} movement Milorg with the assassinations of Norwegian Nazis and informers by training selected Milorg personnel for the task. If asked by Milorg they would also help as executioners. According to Chief of Defence, General Wilhelm von Tangen Hansteen, the group should only act upon decisions by the Home Forces, and they brought no liquidation lists from the UK. The {{problem was that the}} operation had not been approved by Milorg in advance. In a meeting between Milorg leaders Jens Christian Hauge and Arthur Hansson and the expedition leader, it turned out that Bittern operated with a list of persons that SOE wanted to get rid of. The list contained 62 names, which not only included informers and torturers, but also Nazi politicians such as the government [...] "ministers" [...] Hagelin, Lie and Fuglesang. Milorg feared that the reprisals might be terribly harsh compared with the benefits of such assassinations, based on recent experience from Telavåg and Majavatn. It was decided that the agents should be used as instructors for military training and hand-to-hand combat, and the four persons were split into two teams. While one team solved its tasks satisfactorily, the other team's behaviour led to a scandal. After episodes of heavy drinking, too much talking, and other <b>hazardous</b> <b>behaviour,</b> Milorg demanded the two SOE agents to be recalled to the United Kingdom.|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between athlete drinking motives and hazardous drinking across differing levels of sporting participation (club vs elite-provincial vs elite-international). Methods: Data from 1214 New Zealand sports people was collected. We assessed hazardous drinking with the WHO's AUDIT questionnaire and sportspeople's psychosocial reasons for drinking with the ADS. Level of sporting participation (club/social, provincial/state, or international/ olympic level) was also assessed. Results: <b>Hazardous</b> drinking <b>behaviours</b> differed across levels of sporting participation, with elite-provincial sportspeople showing the highest level of hazardous drinking, club/social sportspeople the next highest and elite-international sportspeople the lowest. Sportspeople who placed a greater emphasis on drinking as a reward for participating in their sports tended to display more <b>hazardous</b> drinking <b>behaviours,</b> but other ADS motives differed over level of sporting participation. Elite-provincial sportspeople and elite-international sportspeople placed more emphasis on drinking as a way to cope with the stresses of participating in their sports. A relationship between team/group motives and AUDIT scores was fully mediated by positive reinforcement motives, and partially mediated by stress-related coping motives. Conclusions: These findings have implications for alcohol education programs targeted at sportspeople and sport administration, and may help improve the efficacy and focus of intervention programs...|$|R
40|$|Extreme {{weather events}} {{are likely to}} occur more often under climate change and the {{resulting}} effects on ecosystems {{could lead to a}} further acceleration of climate change. But not all extreme weather events lead to extreme ecosystem response. Here, we focus on <b>hazardous</b> ecosystem <b>behaviour</b> and identify coinciding weather conditions. We use a simple probabilistic risk assessment based on time series of ecosystem behaviour and climate conditions. Given the risk assessment terminology, vulnerability and risk for the previously defined hazard are estimated on the basis of observed <b>hazardous</b> ecosystem <b>behaviour.</b> We apply this approach to extreme responses of terrestrial ecosystems to drought, defining the hazard as a negative net biome productivity over a 12 -month period. We show an application for two selected sites using data for 1981 – 2010 and then apply the method to the pan-European scale for the same period, based on numerical modelling results (LPJmL for ecosystem behaviour; ERA-Interim data for climate). Our site-specific results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, using the SPEI to describe the climate condition. The site in Spain provides an example of vulnerability to drought because the expected value of the SPEI is 0. 4 lower for hazardous than for non-hazardous ecosystem behaviour. In northern Germany, on the contrary, the site is not vulnerable to drought because the SPEI expectation values imply wetter conditions in the hazard case than in the non-hazard case. At the pan-European scale, ecosystem vulnerability to drought is calculated in the Mediterranean and temperate region, whereas Scandinavian ecosystems are vulnerable under conditions without water shortages. These first model-based applications indicate the conceptual advantages of the proposed method by focusing on the identification of critical weather conditions for which we observe <b>hazardous</b> ecosystem <b>behaviour</b> in the analysed data set. Application of the method to empirical time series and to future climate would be important next steps to test the approach...|$|R
40|$|In The Netherlands, young novice drivers (18 - 24 {{years of}} age) show a crash rate that is five {{times higher than}} that of {{experienced}} drivers (30 - 59 years of age). The rate of young males is even seven times as high. The main reasons are lack of driving experience and <b>hazardous</b> <b>behaviour</b> typical of adolescents and young adults. Road safety effects may be achieved among this group by introducing a 'graduated driving licence'. The 2 toDrive experiment that enables adolescents to pass their driving test at the age of 17, upon which they are only allowed to drive accompanied until they reach the age of 18, is an important move towards a graduated driving licence. Other likely measures are training higher order skills, such as traffic insight, self-assessment, hazard perception, risk awareness and risk acceptance and rewarding good behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Most {{healthcare}} organisations are service-oriented, fundamentally {{centred on}} critical {{services provided by}} medical and nursing staff.

40|$|We {{currently}} have little {{understanding of the}} influence of learning opportunity, whether social or environmental, and maternal role on tool-use acquisition in young wild chimpanzees. This study aims to fill this gap by focusing on the acquisition of ant-dipping among chimpanzees of Bossou, Guinea. Ant-dipping is a <b>hazardous</b> tool-use <b>behaviour</b> aimed at army ants (Dorylus spp.). Bossou chimpanzees target these ants both at nests (high risk) and trails (low risk) and employ two techniques to consume them: direct mouthing and pull-through. We present data for 13 mother-offspring pairs (1 - 10 years old). Mothers with young < or = 5 years old dipped significantly more often at trails than at nests, thus minimizing the risk posed to themselves and their young. Infants thus benefited from better conditions to observe and practice ant-dipping. Mothers also varied greatly in their percent time spent ant-dipping and offspring differed in their learning opportunity. Our results suggest that high opportunity young started to observe and perform ant-dipping sooner and were better at ant-dipping than low opportunity young. Although mothers and weaned offspring correlated positively in their percent time spent dipping and proficiency, they did not match in technique used or tool length. Finally, we propose that the learning trajectory of young may predict individual and sex differences in adulthood. This study demonstrates the important role of mothers and learning opportunity in the acquisition of a <b>hazardous</b> tool-use <b>behaviour</b> and suggests that chimpanzee material culture is a product of a complex interaction between social processes and ecological factors...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{underlying}} relationships between self-reported mental health items measuring both positive and negative emotional and behavioural symptoms at the population level in young people. Improved measurement of the full range of mental well-being and mental illness may aid in understanding the aetiological substrates underlying the development of both mental wellness as well as specific psychiatric diagnoses. A general population sample aged 14 to 24 years completed self-report questionnaires on anxiety, depression, psychotic-like symptoms, obsessionality and well-being. Exploratory and confirmatory factor models for categorical data and latent profile analyses were used to evaluate the structure of both mental wellness and illness items. First order, second order and bifactor structures were evaluated on 118 self-reported items obtained from 2228 participants. A bifactor solution was the best fitting latent variable model with one general latent factor termed ‘distress’ and five ‘distress independent’ specific factors defined as self-confidence, antisocial behaviour, worry, aberrant thinking, and mood. Next, six distinct subgroups were derived from a person-centred latent profile analysis of the factor scores. Finally, concurrent validity was assessed using information on <b>hazardous</b> <b>behaviours</b> (alcohol use, substance misuse, self-harm) and treatment for mental ill health: both discriminated between the latent traits and latent profile subgroups. The findings suggest a complex, multidimensional mental health structure in the youth population rather than the previously assumed first or second order factor structure. Additionally, the analysis revealed a low hazardous behaviour/low mental illness risk subgroup not previously described. Population sub-groups show greater validity over single variable factors in revealing mental illness risks. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the structure of self reported mental health is multidimensional in nature and uniquely finds improved prediction to mental illness risk within person-centred subgroups derived from the multidimensional latent traits...|$|R
40|$|Warnings are {{intended}} to improve safety (decreasing injury, illness and loss) by communicating the presence and nature of a potential hazard and encouraging behaviour that will minimise or avoid a negative outcome. Warnings {{can be seen as}} representations of risk, therefore it is likely that an individual’s attitude towards risk, their risk-taking propensity, may affect the way they perceive warnings. Establishing this relationship has important practical implications. If high risk-taking propensity can predict non-compliance, then attempts may be made to increase compliance within high risk-takers by tailoring warnings to such individuals. This thesis aims to explore empirically the relationship between measures of risk-taking propensity and warnings, with potential application to the prevention of <b>hazardous</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Study One investigated the potential relationship between risk-taking propensity and warning perception using an exploratory approach. The results confirmed that various measures of risk-taking propensity predicted warning perceptions, in particular on intentions to comply with the warnings. Studies Two and Three revealed that the relationship between risk-taking and warning perception is domain specific to a certain extent and that it is stronger when contextual information about a hazard is provided. Study Four explored potential underlying mechanisms and revealed that while the mental simulation of positive outcomes of non-compliance was found to be influential, anticipated regret significantly mediated the relationship between risk-taking propensity and intended compliance. Study Five attempted to minimise the discrepancy between high and low risk-takers through warning design manipulation. Despite a strong effect of sensation seeking on intended compliance the warning manipulations implemented had no effect on warning perceptions. This thesis offers a significant contribution to the literature, by establishing empirically the effect of risk propensity on warnings perception and by providing insight into the theoretical underpinnings of this relationship.

The additional variables were found to increase the predictive utility of the TPB. The results have a number of theoretical and practical implications.

30|$|The {{results of}} {{investigations}} into causes of LX accidents have identified inappropriate or inadequate human behaviour {{as the main}} source of the problem. Human factors play an important role for both the road and the rail. Violations of traffic regulations, disregard of warning signals, and trespassing by road vehicle drivers and pedestrians contribute to most of the fatalities. In terms of rail, staff with safety related responsibilities (i.e. manually operated LXs, warnings given by train drivers, supervision, and fall back operations) are particularly vulnerable to human errors. Therefore, design of new technological solutions intended to minimise the impact of human behaviour ought to be based on an analysis of human factors in the context of limiting safety risks at LXs. Such an approach is expected to produce a twofold benefit: it will help increase people’s awareness of risk at LXs and it will minimise the impact of intentional and unintentional <b>hazardous</b> human <b>behaviour.</b> The solution suggested {{at the end of this}} article will consider the highest operational risk at automatic LXs with warning devices and half barriers.

It examines what this might mean for the global youth employment agenda, specifically focusing on a cross-cultural comparison of what young people are actually doing in terms of work and employment. This analysis poses significant questions for a youth employment policy focus that is currently promoting the ‘double universal’ of both youth and employment as ‘black box’ forms of transformation. However, as social scientists have shown, the category of ‘Youth’ itself is frequently left undefined and unclear, {{more often than not}} focusing solely on young men and their <b>hazardous</b> <b>behaviour,</b> ignoring girls, sexual minorities, intra-group diversity and quite often the positive impact of what youth are already doing. At the same time, despite a policy surge, ideas around ‘employment’ through development are also ill-defined and lacking context, with evidence emerging of the increasing gap between jobs people can do and the array of jobs available. As this report explores, people classified as ‘not working’ are often also producing and performing multiple forms of ‘value’ which do not fit neatly into tightly defined development parameters.

40|$|The {{undesired}} {{formation of}} decomposition {{products in the}} accidental scenarios that involve the release of chemicals is a core issue in process safety assessment. The secondary substances may be {{much different from the}} original ones and, in particular, more dangerous for humans or for the ecosystem. Nevertheless, no robust and widely accepted method exists for the assessment of this kind of hazards. In the present study, an approach to the assessment of this hazard was developed in the more general framework of the analysis of the inherent safety of chemical processes. The toxicological, physical and chemical parameters mostly influencing the <b>hazardous</b> <b>behaviour</b> of a released substance are identified by specific environmental fate models and used in the evaluation of hazard footprints. From these data, hazard indexes are determined, that express in a quantitative way the overall behaviour of a substance with respect to specific categories of hazards (acute toxicity, chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity for humans, ecotoxicity). This allows a comprehensive representation of the hazard profile of a substance. Since the data used for the evaluation of the different parameters are usually scant, a simplified estimation procedure was developed, based on the identification of structure-activity relationships. The application of the described approach to several case studies confirmed the effectiveness of the tool for the comparison of the hazards derived by undesired substance decomposition in accidental scenarios...|$|E

For women in traditionally male jobs, SMR was 2. 82 (1. 41 - 5. 05), whereas galley and catering staff had SMRs close to the general female population. The high mortality among women in traditional male jobs could be explained by a high risk of fatal accidents including occupational accidents. In the whole cohort, there were fewer deaths from natural causes than expected but an excess risk of death due to lung cancer, heart diseases, and non-natural deaths. CONCLUSION: The increased mortality could primarily be explained by an excess risk of fatal accidents and suicide. Especially, female seafarers entering traditional male jobs had a high risk of fatal accidents, not only at sea but also ashore. An excess risk of dying of lung cancer and heart diseases probably reflects a high tobacco consumption. Female seafarers are probably influenced by their occupation towards <b>hazardous</b> <b>behaviour</b> and a high risk lifestyle but people with a high risk lifestyle may also be attracted by or forced into high risk jobs such as traditional male jobs at sea...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Aims: To {{assess the}} psychometric {{structure}} and {{construct validity of}} the alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT) in a Great Britain population sample. Methods: A stratified multi-stage random sample of 7849 participants completed the AUDIT as part of a computer assisted interview. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted testing one to three factor models. The factors in these models were correlated with demographic variables and scores relating to perceived wellbeing, verbal IQ, and neurotic and psychosis symptoms to assess {{construct validity of the}} factor solutions. Results: A two factor solution was deemed to appropriately fit the data, measuring alcohol consumption and alcohol related problems. Correlations between the two factors on demographic, wellbeing, neurosis and psychosis symptomology were significantly different. Conclusions: The two factor solution suggests an advantage to investigating factor specific cut off scores for both consumption and alcohol related problems given their difference in predictive validity on both health and demographic variables. The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) was designed as a brief screening instrument to detect <b>hazardous</b> drinking <b>behaviours</b> in the past year (Reinert and Allen, 2002). It {{is one of the most}} commonly used screening instruments and aims to detect problem drinking rather than established alcoholism (Allen et al., 1997) ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} {{prevalence and}} predictors {{of participation in}} the online drinking game ‘neknomination’ amongst university students. Method: A convenience sample of 145 university students participated in a study about drinking behaviours, completing a questionnaire about their participation in neknomination, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, and the Resistance to Peer Influence Scale. Results: Out of 145 students sampled, 54 % took part in neknomination in the previous month. Mann–Whitney U tests revealed significantly higher scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, and significantly lower scores on the Resistance to Peer Influence Scale, for those who had participated in neknomination. A significant correlation was also shown between specific peer pressure to neknominate, and engagement in neknomination. A logistic regression analysis indicated that scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, but not the Resistance to Peer Influence Scale, predicted classification as an individual who participated in neknomination. Conclusions: We found that over half of respondents had participated in a neknomination game in the past month, with almost all male respondents having done so. Participation in neknomination was strongly associated with general <b>hazardous</b> drinking <b>behaviour</b> but not with resistance to peer influence. Further research is needed to understand the role of engagement with social media in drinking games and risky drinking...|$|R
40|$|Polypharmacy, {{broadly defined}} as the chronic co-prescription of several drugs [1], has long been {{recognized}} as problematic. The greater the number of medicines a patient takes, the greater the risk of adverse effects of any one medicine, and the greater the risk of drug–drug interactions. Thus, polypharmacy is an accepted risk for poor health outcomes, including hospitalizations and mortality [2]. The number of drugs per patient (or polypharmacy) {{has come to be}} used as a measure of potentially <b>hazardous</b> professional <b>behaviour,</b> and is sometimes used in conjunction with the term ‘inappropriate prescribing’. Nonetheless, the prevalence of polypharmacy is rising inexorably [3]. This rise is driven, principally, by the rising prevalence of multimorbidity, i. e. the co-occurrence of two or more chronic long-term diseases or conditions in one patient [4]. The issue is compounded by clinical guidelines that advocate the use of several medicines in the management of individual diseases and their associated risk factors [5]. The result is a dilemma for prescribers: on the one hand there is the need to keep the number of medicines to a minimum, while on the other ensuring that the patient receives what evidence-based guidelines advocate as being in their best interest [6].  Journal of Comorbidity 2015; 5 (1) : 29 – 3...|$|R
