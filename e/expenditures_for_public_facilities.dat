30|$|The {{results show}} that the {{introduction}} of tuition fees led to a significant decrease in <b>expenditure</b> <b>for</b> the rent. Expressed as percentages, the corresponding declines amount to 45  % overall and to even 52  % for women. Furthermore, tuition fees reduced <b>expenditure</b> <b>for</b> food in the pooled sample and for women (by 7 and 8  %). The coefficient is, however, not significant for men. In contrast to that, tuition fees increased <b>expenditure</b> <b>for</b> the car (by 13  % in the pooled sample and 14  % for women). These patterns indicate that students (mainly women) have changed their living situation in response to the additional <b>expenditure</b> <b>for</b> tuition fees. Students whose parents live in the surrounding region of the university may decide to live together with their parents to avoid paying rent. Sharing a flat or living with parents may also explain the lower <b>expenditure</b> <b>for</b> food. Furthermore, it may hint to the different mobility behavior expressed by higher spending for a car. Individual mobility may become necessary for commuting between home and university. <b>Expenditure</b> <b>for</b> local <b>public</b> transport is unlikely to vary between students who live near to the university and those who commute from the surrounding region because fees <b>for</b> local <b>public</b> transport are usually obligatory for students. 9 Therefore, variation in <b>expenditure</b> <b>for</b> <b>public</b> transport is not due to different <b>expenditures</b> <b>for</b> local <b>public</b> transport but stems probably from differences in <b>expenditure</b> <b>for</b> longer distance traveling, e.g., for traveling to parents or to friends. For women, tuition fees decreased <b>expenditure</b> <b>for</b> <b>public</b> transport by 16  %. A reason for this may be that women live more often with their parents, as <b>expenditure</b> <b>for</b> traveling home is lower in that case. The share of females in the treatment group living with their parents increased from 20  % (2006) to about 24  % (2009). In the control group, the corresponding share was about 18  % in both years. For men, the introduction of tuition fees increased <b>expenditure</b> <b>for</b> <b>public</b> transport by 14  % but the coefficient is only weakly significant.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{suggests}} that a critical reassessment {{of the theory of}} <b>public</b> <b>facility</b> location is long overdue. A comprehensive theory should contain three standard analytical components: location as access; location as externality; and definition of the policy context <b>for</b> <b>public</b> <b>facility</b> planning. Recent empirical research on mental health facility location is used to illustrate the significance of these analytical themes. Ten years ago, Michael Teitz published an important paper which advocated the development of a distinctive theory <b>for</b> urban <b>public</b> <b>facility</b> location (Teitz 1968). In the decade that followed, a considerable litera-ture has appeared around this theme (Freestone 1977). That the majority of this subsequent research has remained within the bounds of the initial paradigm is a tribute to the synthesis achieved by Teitz. The contention of this essay is, however, that a fundamental realignment of the <b>public</b> <b>facility</b> location theory paradigm is necessary. There are two reasons for this asser-tion. First, in spite of the richness of the paradigm defined by Teitz, hi...|$|R
