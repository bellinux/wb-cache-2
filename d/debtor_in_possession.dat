40|$|When {{a company}} {{experiences}} financial distress, a control contest often follows. Management fights {{to remain in}} control of the company, and shareholders, creditors and others try to influence management’s exercise of that control—or wrest it away. This is not a new phenomenon. The degree of influence now exerted by corporate stakeholders in the distressed context, however, is strikingly different than in the past. Recent headlines highlight that stakeholder control issues are at the forefront of financially-distressed situations large and small. The U. S. government, as creditor, dictated the terms of Chrysler’s and General Motors’ bankruptcies. It also demanded and received preferred stock from several troubled financial institutions, giving those institutions little time or flexibility to consider or reject the terms of the government’s offer. And the U. S. government is not alone in using high-pressure tactics with distressed companies; stakeholders—particularly lenders and other significant creditors—employ such tactics consistently and routinely. This article analyzes the intensified contest for control in corporate reorganizations and whether, as a result, existing bankruptcy laws adequately protect the interests of all of a debtor’s stakeholders. Efforts by a stakeholder to influence control often lead to conflicts of interests and multiple, competing demands on bankruptcy fiduciaries, i. e. <b>debtors</b> <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> and statutory committees. In theory, these fiduciaries should shun their personal interests and any undue influence by particular stakeholders. <b>In</b> practice, however, <b>debtors</b> and committees frequently are unable or unwilling to do so, and bankruptcy courts often do not learn of conflicts, if at all, until it is too late. Accordingly, this article suggests the use of a third-party neutral to correct information asymmetry and promote objectivity and fairness in the bankruptcy process...|$|R

50|$|A <b>debtor</b> <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> in United States {{bankruptcy}} {{law is a}} person or corporation who has filed a bankruptcy petition, but remains in possession of property upon which a creditor has a lien or similar security interest.

50|$|Chapter 11 affords the <b>debtor</b> <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> {{a number}} of {{mechanisms}} to restructure its business. A <b>debtor</b> <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> can acquire financing and loans on favorable terms by giving new lenders first priority on the business's earnings. The court may also permit the <b>debtor</b> <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> to reject and cancel contracts. Debtors are also protected from other litigation against the business through the imposition of an automatic stay. While the automatic stay is in place, creditors are stayed from any collection attempts or activities against the <b>debtor</b> <b>in</b> <b>possession,</b> and most litigation against the debtor is stayed, or put on hold, until it can be resolved in bankruptcy court, or resumed in its original venue. An example of proceedings that are not necessarily stayed automatically are family law proceedings against a spouse or parent. Further, creditors may file with the court seeking relief from the automatic stay.|$|E
40|$|The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 (the Code) posed palpable {{threats to}} secured creditors. It {{was drafted by}} a {{commission}} that was at least as concerned with the rights of debtors as with the rights of creditors. It was modified and adopted by a Congress {{that might have been}} the most liberal since World War II and signed into law by President Carter at the apogee of the left 2 ̆ 7 s power, two years before the Reagan election that marked the rise of the right and the beginning of the left 2 ̆ 7 s decline. The power of the left was exerted most forcefully on behalf of consumer debtors who are not the subject of this paper. [ [...] . ] The thesis of this paper is that the predictions from the Code and the early interpretations of the Code have proved wrong. I believe that chapter 11 s of public companies now form a market that facilitates dealings among secured and unsecured creditors, debtors, employees and others. In that market, the secured creditor has achieved a power and status (as this is written in 2004) that at least equals his status prior to the Code and, perhaps, exceeds it. In this paper I consider only secured creditors in chapter 11 cases of public companies. Secured creditors have achieved this resurrection by clever use of the provisions of the Code and, more importantly, by using their economic power to get agreements from <b>debtors</b> and <b>debtors</b> <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> that mitigate the sting of injurious provisions of the Code. Part of the sting of these provisions has been removed by changes in bankruptcy judges 2 ̆ 7 attitudes and by creditors 2 ̆ 7 guiding debtors to courts where judges might be sympathetic to the secured creditors 2 ̆ 7 arguments and to the enforcement of agreements between debtors or DIP 2 ̆ 7 s and their secured creditors. I divide the discussion into five major subjects: I. Change in judicial attitude concerning the time that a debtor should be allowed to linger in bankruptcy. II. Securitization and other security substitutes that remove assets from bankruptcy 2 ̆ 7 s reach. III. Early liquidation under section 363. IV.

30|$|Our {{data set}} {{includes}} 1236 properties, relating to 909 debtors, that were sold between May 2006 and January 2011. 470 of these properties were sold through foreclosure auctions, and 248 by over-the-counter trades. Redemption {{took place in}} 376 of the cases. 19 The remaining 142 objects are classified as ‘miscellaneous’. This ‘miscellaneous’ category comprises properties for which the realized market price {{could not be found}} because, for example, the intention of liquidating was not pursued any further due to extensive rights of third parties. In cases of redemption, there is no objective market price since there is no market-oriented realization. If the debtor’s EAD is smaller than the property’s market value, and if the liability is completely repaid with the redemption payment, this yields a proceeds ratio of less than 1. However, this cannot necessarily {{be traced back to the}} property alone. If a <b>debtor</b> is <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> of more than one property, a package price is paid. Splitting the price would always be subject to a criticism that an arbitrary figure had been chosen, as the debtor’s willingness to pay for the individual properties is unknown. Therefore, the property in a redemption case will not be considered in the following analysis. Hence, in these cases as well as for the 142 ‘miscellaneous’ cases, the realized market price is missing. For the explanatory model, we therefore only consider 718 objects for which a realized market price is known, here from foreclosure auctions and over-the-counter trades.|$|R
40|$|If someone lends {{money to}} another person, he trusts {{that he will}} get his money back. Particularly {{in the context of}} {{commercial}} relationships, {{there is a need for}} more security. Such security can be achieved by a so-called security right on someone’s property. If the debtor does not pay back the borrowed money, the secured creditor can use his security right to sell the property. From the proceeds, he may recover his claim. The most common example of such a security right is the mortgage on a house. Another security right is the right of pledge. Movable goods and claims can be pledged. In former days, a good could only be pledged if the good was actually handed over to the creditor. If the debtor did pay his loan, he got his property back. One could think of the pawnshop. Since 1992, the Dutch Civil Code offers the possibility to pledge a good, while the <b>debtor</b> stays <b>in</b> <b>possession.</b> This means that the debtor can then continue to use the good, for example if the pledged good is a machine that is necessary for the business operations of the debtor. This PhD thesis analyzes the consequences such invisible security right leads to. Imagine the situation that a third person buys the pledged good from the debtor. Or that a third party gives a loan to the debtor because he thinks that there are enough means of recovery against the debtor’s property. Should there be stricter requirements for invisible security rights? Is the insolvency administrator obliged to give the pledged machine, which is necessary for the business operations, back to the creditor? These and other questions are answered in the PhD thesis. Additionally, solutions are developed to address the arising problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{essential}} idea of real {{security is}} that the debtor transfer to the creditor a possessory interest in a specific item or aggregate of property, chattel or realty, to serve as security for the loan. There are four possible generic types: (1) the debtor vests both ownership and possession of the property in the creditor, subject to a personal obligation to reconvey on repayment; (2) the <b>debtor</b> vests ownership <b>in</b> the creditor, but retains possession of the property by leave of the creditor; (3) the debtor retains ownership of the property, but grants possession irrevocably to the creditor until repayment of the debt; and (4) the debtor retains both ownership and possession of the property, but transfers to the creditor a possessory interest in the property. These four types represent stages of increasingly sophisticated abstraction in the relationship of legal interests denominated as real security. Roman law knew all four of these modes under the names of muncipatio cum fiducia or in iure cessia cum fiducia (commonly known and hereafter designated simply as fiduci), pignus, and hypotheca. The exact character of the real security encompassed by each of these terms is difficult to ascertain and lately has oc- casioned some dispute among Roman law scholars. As a preliminary working definition it may be stated that fiducia. indicated the transfer of ownership to the creditor, who generally but not always retained possession as well; pignus indicated the retention of ownership by the debtor, but the transfer of possession to the creditor; and hypotheca indicated the retention of both ownership and possession by the debtor, but {{with the creation of}} a possessory interest in the creditor. It is {{the purpose of this article}} to present an appraisal of the historical evolution of the Roman real securities and a neutral delineation of the substantive law underlying each possible mode - ownership and <b>possession</b> <b>in</b> the creditor, ownership in the creditor with <b>possession</b> <b>in</b> the <b>debtor,</b> <b>possession</b> <b>in</b> the creditor but ownership <b>in</b> the <b>debtor,</b> and ownership and <b>possession</b> <b>in</b> the <b>debtor</b> with a possessory interest in the creditor entitling him to eventual legal possession...|$|R
