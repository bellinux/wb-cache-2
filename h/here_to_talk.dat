25|$|I {{would be}} a traitor to these poor burned bodies if I came <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> good fellowship. We have tried you good people {{of the public and}} we have found you wanting. The old Inquisition had its rack and its {{thumbscrews}} and its instruments of torture with iron teeth. We know what these things are today; the iron teeth are our necessities, the thumbscrews are the high-powered and swift machinery close to which we must work, and the rack is here in the firetrap structures that will destroy us the minute they catch on fire.|$|E
500|$|Donovan taught Lennon {{a guitar}} finger-picking {{technique}} that he {{passed on to}} Harrison. The technique was subsequently implemented by Lennon on the Beatles songs [...] "Julia" [...] and [...] "Dear Prudence". The latter was composed by Lennon to lure Prudence Farrow out of her intense meditation. Lennon later said: [...] "She'd been locked in for three weeks {{and was trying to}} reach God quicker than anyone else". Another inspiration was hearing for the first time Bob Dylan's newly released album, John Wesley Harding. The stay at the ashram {{turned out to be one}} of the group's most creative periods. According to Lennon he wrote some of the [...] "most miserable" [...] and some of his [...] "best songs" [...] while he was in Rishikesh. Both Lennon and McCartney often spent time composing rather than meditating, and even Starr wrote a song, [...] "Don't Pass Me By", which was his first solo composition. Plans were made for a concert in Delhi to feature the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Donovan, and Paul Horn. Harrison complained that more time should be spent on meditating, saying, [...] "We're not <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about music. We're here to meditate." [...] Lennon commented on Harrison's commitment to meditation by saying: [...] "The way George [...] is going, he'll be flying a magic carpet by the time he's forty." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, {{after the}} release of Juiced, Mark McGwire was among 11 Major League Baseball players that were {{publicly}} addressed concerning their use of steroids. During the accusations McGwire was noted for avoiding direct questions from Congress, instead continually saying [...] "I'm not <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the past." [...] Although he never admitted to steroid use, the public certainly questioned {{whether or not he was}} a user because of his unwillingness to answer direct questions. McGwire was never officially identified as a steroid user, however his public image suffered after he failed to respond to these accusations.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, but it's {{kill and}} let kill with him. That is what Horace says. However, I {{am tired of}} all that now, and I came <b>here</b> to-day <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about {{something}} else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{you said}} before, in 1917," [...] was the dry reminder. [...] "I {{did not come}} <b>here,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> world {{politics}} with you. Those things for the moment are finished. I came in answer to your summons." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not do that, Mr. Finn. There can be {{no reason}} for it. But I did not ask you <b>to</b> come <b>here</b> to-day <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about Oswald or Violet. I have given you my advice about that, and I can do no more." ...|$|R
2500|$|Many top players, {{including}} Canseco, Alex Rodriguez, Rafael Palmeiro, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, and Curt Schilling were summoned on March 17, 2005 {{to testify}} in front of Congress (Schilling was summoned because of his outspoken opposition {{to the use of}} PEDs). [...] During the session, Canseco admitted his steroid use which he claims was perfectly acceptable during the 1980s and early 90's. [...] Palmeiro denied all steroid use during his career, while McGwire refused to discuss the issue, contending that he would be considered guilty no matter what he said. His repeated statement [...] "I'm not <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the past," [...] became the most highlighted moment of the proceedings.|$|E
2500|$|Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines {{broadcast}} radio shows suggesting {{the end to}} toleration of the Tutsi, repeating the Hutu Ten Commandments, and building support for the Hutu Power ideology. Two main voices of RTLM were announcers Valérie Bemeriki and Georges Ruggiu. The repetition of Hutu Ten Commandments {{was an attempt to}} mobilize the population to help eradicate the Tutsi, who were portrayed as threatening the social and political order achieved since independence, and as envisioned by the Akazu. Politician Léon Mugesera gave a speech in November, 1992, allegedly stating, [...] "Do not be afraid, know that anyone whose neck you do not cut is the one who will cut your neck...Let them pack their bags, let them get going, so that no one will return <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> and no one will bring scraps claiming to be flags!" [...] The radio programs frequently referred to the Tutsi as inyenzi, a Kinyarwanda word meaning 'cockroach', though the term had also been a self-description by members of the Rwanda Patriotic Front.|$|E
2500|$|Both leaders, Massoud and Haq, were {{recognized}} for being fiercely independent from foreign, especially Pakistani, influence. Both, {{two of the}} most successful anti-Soviet resistance leaders, were rejecting the Pakistani claim of hegemony over the Afghan mujahideen. Abdul Haq was quoted as saying during the anti-Soviet period: [...] "How is that we Afghans, who never lost a war, must take military instructions from the Pakistanis, who never won one?" [...] Massoud during the Soviet period said to the Pakistani Foreign Minister who had asked him {{to send a message to}} the Russians through the Pakistanis who were conducting talks [...] "on behalf of our Afghan brethren": [...] "Why should I send a message? Why are you talking on our behalf? Don't we have leaders <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> on our behalf?" [...] Khan replied [...] "This is how it has been and how it will be. Do you have a message?" [...] Massoud told the foreign minister that [...] "nobody who talks on our behalf will have any kind of result." [...] Consequently, neither Massoud nor Abdul Haq were consulted before and neither participated in the Battle of Jalalabad (1989) in which the ISI tried but failed to install Gulbuddin Hekmatyar as the post-communist leader of Afghanistan.|$|E

2500|$|On December 9 at 1230 (GMT) {{bilateral}} {{talks between}} the CNDP and Kinshasa government opened at the United Nations headquarters in the Kenyan capital city of Nairobi, mediated by UN envoy Olusegun Obasanjo; the respective leaders of the two groups, Laurent Nkunda and President Joseph Kabila, did not participate. Kenyan Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula issued {{a statement to the}} delegations telling them to [...] "put aside your differences and realise that you have only one Congo, and that the international community is here with you to encourage and assist you. Please don't let Africa and your country down." [...] The talks, chaired by President Mwai Kibaki and attended by former President of Tanzania Benjamin Mkapa, who represented the African Union, were referred to as [...] "an opportunity that should neither be lost nor wasted" [...] by Obasanjo, who stated that [...] "A military solution is not an option. We appeal to your principles to make this dialogue a success." [...] Obasanjo went on to declare that the talks should accomplish a permanent cease-fire in eastern Congo, continued reinforcement of a corridor for humanitarian assistance in the region, and a lasting peace in Congo; he also praised the delegations for their efforts. Wetangula added, [...] "The pictures and clips we have been seeing on international TV screens remains a terrible indictment to all of us Africans, you Congolese in particular. I want you to be awake {{to the fact that the}} children, the women, the boys and girls that we see on TV every day may be your sons and daughters, may be your brothers and sisters, may be your parents. And it is for those that you are <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> peace." [...] Rebel spokesman Rene Abandi declared the rebels' intent to [...] "talk quickly and go back home as quickly as possible, even though there are many issues to solve." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I did {{not come}} <b>here,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the murder, Carry. If I thought you knew who did it, I shouldn't ask you.
