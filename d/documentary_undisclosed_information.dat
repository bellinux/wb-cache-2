40|$|I {{examine the}} {{implications}} of nondisclosure in a setting {{where there is a}} credible signal as to the proprietary nature of the <b>undisclosed</b> <b>information.</b> Specifically, I investigate the market and analysts' response to firms’ application to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a confidential treatment order (CTO), which allows firms to redact required disclosures from SEC filings when the redacted information is proprietary. I find that the market and analysts react favorably to the voluntary nondisclosure of proprietary information using the SEC confidential treatment process. Market and analysts reactions are more favorable to the redaction of information that is more likely to have proprietary value, such as information related to research and development. In addition, I show that the redacting firms experience superior accounting performance compared to their peers in the years following the redaction, consistent with the market and analysts’ response to the redaction. However, I find that analysts engage in more intense private information search in response to a CTO redaction. This finding suggests that, although a CTO redaction can signal the nature of <b>undisclosed</b> <b>information,</b> analysts believe that the signal is not fully revealing of the economic magnitude of the <b>undisclosed</b> <b>information.</b> Overall, this study’s findings indicate that a firm's willingness to submit to the CTO approval process serves as a credible signal of the proprietary nature of the withheld information. The {{results of this study suggest}} a possible role for a credible signaling channel to facilitate communication between insiders and outsiders regarding the nature of withheld information...|$|R
40|$|We have {{experienced}} a growing importance of intellectual capital and intangible assets and an increased tendency for firms and public institutions to privatize, {{by the use of}} patents or copyrights, their knowledge assets and creative expressions. Because control over the use of an intellectual property right (IPR) requires ownership or a licence, the growing importance of knowledge-based assets and creative expressions has been accompanied by recognition that patents and copyrights represent strategic assets for those who own and control them. It is therefore not surprising that, in recent years, the pace at which individuals, firms and the public sector are using IPRs to privatize knowledge-based assets and creative expressions has been accelerating. This trend has been enhanced by the view of many industry, government and international agencies that the privatization of the intellectual capital and knowledge-based assets of individuals and firms provides many advantages (for example, competitive advantage), and we have seen an increased enforcement of IPR regimes worldwide. Protection of <b>undisclosed</b> <b>information</b> is least known to players of IPR and also least talked about, although it is perhaps the most important form of protection for industries, R&D institution and agencies dealing with IPR. <b>Undisclosed</b> <b>information</b> generally known as trade secrets or confidential information includes formula, pattern, compilation, programme, device, method, technique or process.

Over the years, there has been an effort by the government to reduce opacity, but even so, these initiatives often do not realize their full potential.

To evaluate it, we tested 26 popular applications, including system and file utilities, media players, and IM clients.

40|$|Intellectual {{property}} (IP), broadly defined, is {{a series}} of privileges accorded to inventors and creators. These privileges are recognized through a series of international agreements that establish minimum standards. The most significant of these agreements is probably the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) that binds WTO Member States to comply with a range of existing international IP agreements, and then imposes minimum standards for copyright and related rights, trademarks, geographical indications, industrial designs, patents, layout designs (topographies) of integrated circuits, and <b>undisclosed</b> <b>information</b> (TRIPS Articles 9 - 39). These IP privileges are generally recognized and enforced through national laws that are consistent with these international norms. The result is a patchwork of national laws, each attempting to articulate at least the minimum standards (albeit many are more generous-the so-called "TRIPS-plus") in the context of national and regional choices. The TRIPS standards adopted and applied by WTO Member States are then subject to WTO dispute resolution and penalties that include retaliatory trade sanctions where states have not implemented and applied their obligations to maintain TRIPS' minimum IP standards (TRIPS Article 64). The WTO dispute resolution and sanction mechanism makes TRIPS one the few enforceable international laws, and hence its gravity in assessing the impacts of IP.

These public reports must be filed using a prescribed form and must be filed within a specific time frame. Failure to file these public reports or filing with inaccurate information constitutes an offence under securities law. The two main objectives served by these reporting rules are: (1) primarily as a regulatory tool to detect or prevent the improper use of <b>undisclosed</b> <b>information</b> by insiders; and (2) to increase market efficiency by providing investors with information concerning the trading activities of an issuer.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} the main motivations for Italian insiders to trade relevant stakes of their companies, specifically assuming that most transactions are driven by speculative intents. According to an information asymmetry hypothesis, insiders, having a superior information set, may better detect the temporary under or overvaluation of stocks. Moreover, when insider trading law is not well enforced, insiders may take advantage of relevant and <b>undisclosed</b> <b>information.</b> In both cases, such transactions would convey an important signal to uninformed traders. Design/methodology/approach – In order to determine whether insiders are able to earn abnormal returns, a standard event study methodology is used and, then, a profitable mimicking portfolio strategy is proposed. Findings – The paper finds statistical evidence of {{a positive relationship between}} the change of holdings and the sign of market movement: excess returns are earned after a positive increase of relevant stakes and negative abnormal returns follow an opposite insiders' strategy. In particular, we find significant excess returns between the first and the third month following insiders' transactions. Market response is generally higher for insiders' purchases rather than sales and for insiders owning more than 50 per cent of the company. Research limitations/implications – As at European level laws on insider trading have been updated recently, future research could study this phenomenon after 2002, investigating if new laws were able to guarantee strong efficiency of the Italian market. Originality/value – This paper is interesting because {{it is one of the}} few studies on insider trading carried out outside the USA. Insider trading, Italy, Stock markets...|$|R
