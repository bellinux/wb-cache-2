Parrots interacted more, positively or negatively, with individuals of its own group. Training session closer to the release date should be tried.

40|$|Abstract INTRODUCTION: Enriched environments {{normally}} increase behavioral repertoires and {{diminish the}} expression of abnormal behaviors and stress-related physiological problems in animals. Although {{it has been shown}} that experimental animals infected with microorganisms can modify their behaviors and physiology, few studies have evaluated how environmental enrichment affects these parameters. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of environmental enrichment on the behavior and physiology of confined mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. METHODS: The behaviors of 20 T. cruzi-infected mice and 20 non-infected mice were recorded during three treatments: baseline, enrichment, and post-enrichment. Behavioral data were collected using scan sampling with <b>instantaneous</b> <b>recording</b> of behavior every 30 s, totaling 360 h. Plasma TNF, CCL 2, and IL- 10 levels and parasitemia were also evaluated in infected enriched/non-enriched mice. Behavioral data were evaluated by Friedman’s test and physiological data by one-way ANOVA and area under the curve (AUC) analysis. RESULTS: Results showed that environmental enrichment significantly increased exploratory behaviors and diminished inactivity. The use of environmental enrichment did not diminish circulating levels of TNF and IL- 10 but diminished circulating levels of CCL 2 and parasitemia. CONCLUSIONS: Positive behavioral and physiological effects of environmental enrichment were observed in mice living in enriched cages. Thus, environmental enrichment improved the welfare of these animals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} an algorithm based on optical flow for the extraction of flow waveforms from dynamic digital x-ray images. The {{aim of this study}} was to extend the validation of this technique to blood flow measurement in moving vessels. A pulsatile blood flow circuit was constructed to simulate the human arterial circulation using a length of silicone tubing as a model artery. A computer-programmable manipulator was used to move the model artery. <b>Instantaneous</b> <b>recording</b> of flow from an electromagnetic flow meter (EMF) provided the “gold standard ” measurement. Dynamic biplane x-ray images with injection of iodine contrast medium were acquired for different flow rates. The image data were formed into parametric images in which grey level represents contrast medium concentration as a function of time and distance along the vessel. The blood flow velocities were calculated as the ratio of temporal and spatial derivatives in the parametric image and then averaged along the vessel length using a weighting scheme based on the magnitude of the spatial derivative. The correlation coefficient between x-ray and EMF measurements was 0. 922 (p< 0. 001) for instantaneous flows and 0. 891 (p< 0. 001) for average flows. The mean difference (X-ray-EMF) was – 15. 8 ml/min for instantaneous flows and 0. 3 ml/min for average flows. ...|$|E

When kept in pens with limited access to bedding materials stress can originate and often lead to undesired behaviours. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether environmental enrichment in terms of ropes and an activity ball containing piglet food, can provide an outlet for their natural behaviours and thus reduce undesired behaviours. In total, 141 pigs were used and divided into three groups, control-, activity ball- and rope groups. The observation methods used were 1 / 0 recording and <b>instantaneous</b> <b>recording</b> with 15 second intervals.

Between the three groups, a decrease in ear-, tail- and equipment biting was seen in the two enriched groups on day 1. On day 3 these difference could only be seen between the control group and the other two groups in equipment biting. However, few data ware collected and so we cannot confirm our hypotheses, concerning whether the environmental enrichments decreased the undesirable behaviours or not. However, most of our findings are in compliance with earlier studies as we among other things found that the rope worked better than the activity ball and that the interest of the enrichments decreased with time. ...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to test whether it would be possible to train captive-bred North American bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) to avoid a model avian predator and to measure their behavioral responses to this predator. We used 18 animals divided into two groups, trained (N[*]=[*] 6) and control (N[*]=[*] 12); these individuals were from a line that has been bred in captivity for at least 20 generations without predator contact. The trained group was exposed, individually, to 20 sequential antipredator training sessions, during which the presence of a model avian predator was paired with an aversive stimulus. The control group was exposed, individually, once only to the same model avian predator, but without the association of the aversive stimulus. Both groups were observed for 10 min after the presentation of the avian predator, during which their behavior was recorded using <b>instantaneous</b> <b>recording</b> of behavior. The results showed that, after only two training sessions, the trained bullfrogs started to express proper antipredator behavior: diving to the bottom of the tank, lying still, and eventually, learning to cover themselves in substrate (mud). However, continued training sessions provoked a varied response to antipredator training, which was undesirable as the effectiveness of their antipredator response varied.

40|$|Studies {{of smoking}} {{behavior}} commonly use the time-line follow-back (TLFB) method, or periodic retrospective recall, {{to gather data}} on daily cigarette consumption. TLFB is considered adequate for identifying periods of abstinence and lapse but not for measurement of daily cigarette consumption, thanks to substantial recall and digit preference biases. With {{the development of the}} hand-held electronic diary (ED), it has become possible to collect cigarette consumption data using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), or the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>recording</b> of each cigarette as it is smoked. EMA data, because they do not rely on retrospective recall, are thought to more accurately measure cigarette consumption. In this article we present an analysis of consumption data collected simultaneously by both methods from 236 active smokers in the pre-quit phase of a smoking cessation study. We define a statistical model that describes the genesis of the TLFB records as a two-stage process of mis-remembering and rounding, including fixed and random effects at each stage. We use Bayesian methods to estimate the model, and we evaluate its adequacy by studying histograms of imputed values of the latent remembered cigarette count. Our analysis suggests that both mis-remembering and heaping contribute substantially to the distortion of self-reported cigarette counts. Higher nicotine dependence, white ethnicity and male sex are associated with greater remembered smoking given the EMA count. The model is potentially useful in other applications where it is desirable to understand the process by which subjects remember and report true observations.

To {{clarify the}} formation of curvature of the zonal structures in {{the west of the}} convex form and further to discuss the tectonic evolution of central Honshu, we carried out a paleomagnetic study of dated (∼ 15 Ma) dike rocks of the Shitara basin. Samples were collected from 25 basalt dikes trending north-south with a nearly vertical intrusion surface. After stepwise alternating-field and thermal demagnetization, 24 site-mean directions were determined. Three dikes gave anomalous directions, probably resulting from <b>instantaneous</b> <b>recording</b> of a field transition or excursion. The other 21 site-means produced a mean direction, D = 9.7 °, I = 54.5 °, α 95 = 5.2 °, and a paleomagnetic pole at 82.3 °N, 216.6 °E, A 95 = 6.2 °. Although the reversal test is negative at the 5 % significance level, the mean direction and pole are time-averaged ones in which the secular variation is averaged out. This was confirmed by studying the angular standard deviation of virtual geomagnetic poles. We conclude that the central Honshu curvature formed when the southwest Japan arc rotated clockwise between 17 and 15 Ma in relation to the opening of the Japan Sea, associated with differential rotation of {{the eastern part of the}} arc with respect to the central part. The differential rotation probably resulted from a sinistral shear on the eastern margin of the rotating arc. The formation of the curvature seems not to have borne on the collision of the Izu-Ogasawara arc with Honshu, although the collision probably caused large-scale clockwise rotation of the Kanto Mountains in the east of the northward-convex structure.|$|E
