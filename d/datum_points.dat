50|$|In case of {{plane or}} spatial coordinates, we {{typically}} need several <b>datum</b> <b>points.</b> A regional, ellipsoidal datum like ED 50 {{can be fixed}} by prescribing the undulation of the geoid and the deflection of the vertical in one datum point, {{in this case the}} Helmert Tower in Potsdam.

40|$|Abstract — We {{introduce}} palmprint recognition, one of {{the most}} reliable personal identification methods in the biometric technology. In this paper, a new approach to the palmprint matching by constructing local and global line feature structures is presented. The <b>datum</b> <b>point</b> of palmprint acts as an important registration due to its remarkable advantage about its spatial location. Initially we define all possible local line feature structures constructed with adjacent lines, around <b>datum</b> <b>point.</b> Through a first level match using these local line feature structures, we get best matched line features. Using these best matched line features, we construct a global line feature structure of palmprint with <b>datum</b> <b>point</b> as reference. This global line feature structure is spread across in four quadrants, <b>datum</b> <b>point</b> being the origin. We then carry out a second level match using this global structure of palmprint to reliably determine its uniqueness. The two levels of matching using local and global line feature structures helps in effective palmprint recognition. With several palmprint images, we tested out proposed verification system and the experimental result shows that the performance of our algorithm is good...|$|R
50|$|When these {{coordinates}} {{are realized}} by choosing <b>datum</b> <b>points</b> and fixing a geodetic datum, ISO uses the terminology coordinate reference system, while IERS {{speaks of a}} reference frame.

50|$|A {{weighted}} average is an average that has multiplying factors to give different weights to data at different {{positions in the}} sample window. Mathematically, the moving average is the convolution of the <b>datum</b> <b>points</b> with a fixed weighting function. One application is removing pixelisation from a digital graphical image.|$|E
5000|$|The brute-force {{method to}} {{calculate}} {{this would be}} to store all of the data and calculate the sum and divide {{by the number of}} <b>datum</b> <b>points</b> every time a new datum point arrived.

50|$|Because {{geodetic}} point coordinates (and heights) are always obtained {{in a system}} that has been constructed itself using real observations, geodesists introduce the concept of a geodetic datum: a physical realization of a coordinate system used for describing point locations. The realization is the result of choosing conventional coordinate values for one or more <b>datum</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{a number}} of applications, it is {{advantageous}} to avoid the shifting induced by using only 'past' data. Hence a central moving average can be computed, using data equally spaced {{on either side of}} the point in the series where the mean is calculated. This requires using an odd number of <b>datum</b> <b>points</b> in the sample window.|$|E

50|$|Kilometers on {{the modern}} Circum-Baikal are {{traditionally}} measured from the Irkutsk exchange station, which until 1934 was the administrative {{border between the}} Tomsk railway and the Transbaikal Railway.

50|$|Ordnance Survey still {{maintains}} {{a set of}} master geodetic reference points to tie the Ordnance Survey geographic <b>datum</b> <b>points</b> to modern measurement systems such as GPS.

The Grid is known technically as OSGB36 (Ordnance Survey Great Britain 1936) and was introduced after the 1936-53 retriangulation.|$|E
50|$|If {{the data}} used are not {{centered}} around the mean, a simple moving average lags behind the latest datum point by half the sample width. An SMA can also be disproportionately influenced by old <b>datum</b> <b>points</b> dropping out or new data coming in.

But a perfectly regular cycle is rarely encountered.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} a datum search game, where a target reveals his {{position}} (<b>datum</b> <b>point)</b> {{at a certain time}} (datum time) and a pursuer begins the search for the target by distributing his searching effort some time later The target might move in the diffusive fashion from the <b>datum</b> <b>point</b> to evade his pursuer His motion is restricted by its continuity in a two-dimensional space and constraints on its energy and maximum speed The pursuer distributes searching effort to detect the evader under constraints on the amount of effort. A payoff is assumed to be the summation of searching effort weighted by the probability distribution of the target In the previous paper, we formulated the problem as a single-stage two-person zero-sum game on continuous space and continuous time and proposed an upper bound and a lower bound for the value of the game.
