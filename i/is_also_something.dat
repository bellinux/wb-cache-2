25|$|Subrahmanyam long {{argued for}} {{revamping}} India's national security decision-making apparatus, {{and was also}} vociferous in his criticism of several governments' efforts at tinkering with the system. He was particularly critical of successive Indian governments' lackadaisical approach to long-term strategic planning, and their similar attitudes {{to the creation of}} specialised positions and resources. One noted target of such criticism was his civil service batch mate Brajesh Mishra, who served as both National Security Adviser—when that post was created—and Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee from 1998 to 2004. Subrahmanyam repeatedly called for bifurcating both key posts, in commentary sometimes so strong that it even appeared to precipitate a public spat between the two. This bifurcation of posts was finally done by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, in consultation with Subrahmanyam, upon assuming office in 2004. The establishment of a National Defence University by the government <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>something</b> he long demanded. Despite several recommendations, including those from a government committee Subrahmanyam himself chaired, this is yet to be set up.|$|E

25|$|Selecting and {{commanding}} units only {{forms the}} basic gameplay of Soulblighter, however. The battles {{are more complex}} than simply commanding units to attack the enemy, with strategy and awareness of {{the conditions of the}} battlefield, and even the weather, also playing important roles. For example, due to the game's physics engine, objects react with one another, with units, and with the terrain. This can manifest itself simply in a severed head bouncing off one of the player's units and changing direction. However, it can also have more serious consequences. For example, a dwarf could throw a molotov cocktail at an enemy on a hillside and miss, with the projectile rolling back down the hill towards the player's own units. Projectiles in general, both those used by the player and the enemy, have no guarantee of hitting anything; they are merely propelled in the direction instructed by the physics engine. Arrows, for example, may miss their intended target due to a small degree of simulated aiming error that becomes more significant at long range, or the target may move out of the way, or behind a tree or building. If archers are firing at enemies who are engaged in melee combat, they may also hit the player's own units instead of the enemy, causing the same amount of damage. This is also true of dwarfs' molotov cocktails. As such, friendly fire is an important aspect of the game. The weather <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>something</b> the player must always bear in mind. For example, rain or snow can put out explosive-based attacks. It is also much easier for projectile units to hit enemies below them rather than above them, and as such, positioning of the player's units is an important aspect of the game.|$|E

500|$|Durkheim {{agrees with}} Kant that within morality, {{there is an}} element of obligation, [...] "a moral {{authority}} which, by manifesting itself in certain precepts particularly important to it, confers upon [...] an obligatory character." [...] Morality tells us how to act from a position of superiority. There exists a certain, pre-established moral norm to which we must conform. It is through this view that Durkheim makes a first critique of Kant in saying that moral duties originate in society, and are not to be found in some universal moral concept such as the categorical imperative. Durkheim also argues that morality is characterized not just by this obligation, but <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>something</b> that is desired by the individual. The individual believes that by adhering to morality, they are serving the common Good, and for this reason, the individual submits voluntarily to the moral commandment.|$|E
500|$|Initial {{sales of}} the album were strong but dropped off disappointingly as {{contemporary}} reviews of the album were mixed. Critic Ira Robbins wrote [...] "although this casual loud-rock outing... seems on first blush to be slapdash and slight, the first side is actually quite good, offering provocative pop-culture lyrics delivered with first-take enthusiasm and carefree backing." [...] In 1987, Spin magazine called the album [...] "an inspired and brilliantly crafted work. It's charged with a positive spirit that makes art soul food; imbued with the contagious energy that gives ideas a leg to dance on", but in 1989 a different reviewer for the magazine called the album [...] "disappointing". Rolling Stone magazine called the work an [...] "odd, freewheeling pastiche of elements from all the previous Bowies," [...] "unfocused," [...] and possibly [...] "the noisiest, sloppiest Bowie album ever. ... Being noisy and sloppy isn't necessarily a bad thing, but sad to say, Never Let Me Down <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>something</b> of a mess." [...] Another critic held a general optimism for {{the potential of the}} songs on the album, complaining only that the [...] "oppressive production" [...] ruined the songs. Billboard magazine's 1987 retrospective issue called Never Let Me Down [...] "arguably the year's most underrated release" [...] and considered the album a [...] "Critic's Choice" [...] for the year.|$|E

2500|$|Truth, says Michel Foucault, is {{problematic}} when any attempt {{is made to}} see truth as an [...] "objective" [...] quality. [...] He prefers {{not to use the}} term truth itself but [...] "Regimes of Truth".

2500|$|Later playwrights also {{borrowed}} Plautus's stock characters. One of {{the most}} important echoes of Plautus is the stock character of the parasite. Certainly the best example of this is Falstaff, Shakespeare's portly and cowardly knight. As J. W. Draper notes, the gluttonous Falstaff shares many characteristics with a parasite such as Artotrogus from Miles Gloriosus. Both characters seem fixated on food and where their next meal is coming from. But they also rely on flattery in order to gain these gifts, and both characters are willing to bury their patrons in empty praise. Of course, Draper notes that Falstaff <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>something</b> of a boastful military man, but notes, [...] "Falstaff is so complex a character that he may well be, in effect, a combination of interlocking types." ...|$|E
2500|$|A.O. Scott {{writing in}} The New York Times came to believe, [...] "The {{relentless}} {{attention to the}} sheer awfulness of war, which is the film's great strength, <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>something</b> of a shortcoming. Mr. Gitai reproduces the numb horror of wading through fields of gore almost too well: the self-protective response is to shut down your emotions, as the characters do. Kippur immerses you in violence and agony, but it may leave you with a curious feeling of detachment." [...] Sean Axmaker of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, felt Kippur was [...] "almost abstract in its portrait of confusion. Long, numbing scenes of soldiers rushing through the war zone with the wounded and returning for more are accompanied by an overwhelming soundtrack of tanks, helicopters and explosions." [...] He also reserved praise for director Gitai, saying he [...] "captures a chaotic portrait of the war with no glory, only the confusion, fear, and fatigue of a tour under fire." [...] Author G.A. of Time Out called the film [...] "impressive" [...] while remarking [...] "Gitai's autobiographically inspired account of the harrowing experiences of a first-aid team {{in the aftermath of}} Syria and Egypt's surprise attack on Israel in October 1973 typically features long, sinuous takes to chart the way in which patriotic enthusiasm is steadily eroded and replaced by fatigue and disillusionment." [...] In a mixed review, Fred Camper writing for the Chicago Reader felt director [...] "Gitai plunges the viewer into the reality of modern warfare, in which the enemy is often invisible – we never see the Syrians in Kippur – and battle lines are often unclear." [...] Jack Mathews writing for the NY Daily News, believed that instead of [...] "heightening our sense of empathy, we become numbed by the repetition" [...] of the film.|$|E

One was to examine a great bed of now-existing shells, {{elevated}} 350 feet above {{the level of the}} sea: from among these shells, large forest-trees were growing. Another ride was to P. Huechucucuy. I had with me a guide who knew the country far too well; for he would pertinaciously tell me endless Indian names for every little point, rivulet, and creek. In the same manner as in Tierra del Fuego, the Indian language appears singularly well adapted for attaching names to the most trivial features of the land. I believe every one was glad to say farewell to Chiloe; yet if we could forget the gloom and ceaseless rain of winter, Chiloe might pass for a charming island. There <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>something</b> very attractive in the simplicity and humble politeness of the poor inhabitants.|$|E
