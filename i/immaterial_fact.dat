According to Durkheim, these phenomena cannot be reduced to biological or psychological grounds. Social facts can be material (physical objects) or immaterial (meanings, sentiments, etc.). The latter cannot be seen or touched, but they are external and coercive, and as such, they become real, gain [...] "facticity". Physical objects can represent both material and immaterial social facts; for example a flag is a physical social fact that often has various <b>immaterial</b> social <b>facts</b> (the meaning and importance of the flag) attached to it.|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} issue of {{incorporating}} domain-specific preferences in planning systems, where a preference may be seen as a “soft ” constraint that it is desirable, but not necessary, to satisfy. To this end, we identify two types of preferences, choice preferences that give a preference over which formulas (typically subgoals) to establish, and temporal preferences, which specify a desirable ordering on the establishment of formulas. Preferences may be constructed from actions or fluents but, as we show, this distinction is <b>immaterial.</b> In <b>fact,</b> we allow preferences on arbitrary formulas build from action and fluent names. These preference orderings induce preference ordering on resulting plans, the maximal elements of which yield the preferred plans. We argue that the approach is general and flexible; as well, it handles conditional preferences. Our framework is developed in the context of transition systems; hence, it is applicable to a large number of different action languages, including the well-known language C. Furthermore, our results are applicable to general planning formalisms...|$|R

It “says” more things to you than you can repeat to see the past, the ancient world, as you stand there, bodily turned up with the spade and transformed from an <b>immaterial,</b> inaccessible <b>fact</b> of time into a matter of soils and surfaces. —Henry James, Italian Hours, “A Roman Holiday,” 1909 Cultural property offers a significant yet ambiguous example of the development of global regulatory regimes beyond the State. On the one hand, traditional international law instruments do not seem to ensure an adequate level of protection for cultural heritage; securing such protection requires procedures, norms, and standards produced by global institutions, both public (such as UNESCO) and private (such as the International Council of Museums). On the other hand, a comprehensive global regulatory regime to complement the law of cultural property is still to be achieved. Instead, more regimes are being established, depending on the kind of properties and public interests at stake. Moreover, the huge cultural bias that dominates the debate about cultural property accentuates the “clash of civilizations” that already underlies the debate about global governance. The analysis of the relationship between globalization and cultural property, therefore, sheds light on broader global governance trends and helps highlight the points of weakness and strength in the adoption of administrative law techniques at the global level...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the phenomenon of}} the television detective tour: a guided tour of various locations known from popular television detective series. The main question is how the increasing popularity of such tours can be explained. It is suggested that the locations involved offer a material reference for what is in <b>fact</b> <b>immaterial</b> imagination. By singling out and visiting these locations it becomes possible for tourists to make a symbolic distinction between the cultural categories 'reality' and 'imagination'. To give this process a name a new concept is introduced: lieux d'imagination. This concept is grounded and developed on the basis of an ethnographic analysis of three popular television detective tours: the 'Inspector Morse Tour' in Oxford the 'Baantjer Tour' in Amsterdam and the 'Wallander Tour' in Ystad. A total of 34 interviews were held with employees of tourist agencies with guides local inhabitants and tourists. Furthermore participants of the tours were observed. The analysis of the interview transcripts and observation reports shows that lieux d'imagination are the result of a complex process of negotiations and appropriatio...|$|R

40|$|In early 21 st Century Beijing, in {{the context}} of the One Child Policy and the {{developing}} market economy, middle class women undertook extraordinary measures to have children of the highest possible quality. A baby making industry, comprising private maternity hospitals, providers of prenatal nutrition, imported formula, and supplements, emerged. Women used taijiao, or fetal education, fetal testing and myriad forms of pregnancy management as part of a project of having the smartest, healthiest baby possible. Based on two years of fieldwork in reproductive contexts in Beijing, this dissertation seeks to untangle the complicated relationship between reproduction, state population policies, parents, fetuses, and babies. It argues that the caring labor of hospital workers, sometimes categorized as <b>immaterial,</b> is in <b>fact</b> very much material, in that it creates particular kinds of persons, and that the materiality of this labor demonstrates that material and immaterial are not useful categories. It considers the “non-spectacular” tools of patient education and fetal education alongside spectacular tools of visualization. It argues that technologically assisted reproduction is not exceptional, but rather is on a spectrum with more everyday tools and techniques for influencing pregnancy, such as low-tech educational equipment, stories and metaphors, and fetal education. The dissertation argues that emergent practices of reproduction, specifically the simultaneous use of taijiao and fetal testing, especially the ultrasound, are producing new kinds of fetal personhood, a partial personhood wherein a fetus is both a person and not a person...|$|R
5000|$|We believe, {{given the}} manner in which Gosnell operated, that he killed the vast {{majority}} of babies that he aborted after 24 weeks. We cannot, however, recommend murder charges for all of these cases. In order to constitute murder, the act must involve a baby who was born alive. Because files were falsified or removed from the facility and possibly destroyed, we cannot substantiate all of the individual cases in which charges might otherwise have resulted." [...] The report also examined the failings of official parties, and the key findings, analyzed in two categories: [...] “Janice Staloski of the Pennsylvania Department of Health, who personally participated in the 1992 site visit, but decided to let Gosnell slide on the violations that were already evident then. She eventually rose to become director of the division that was supposed to regulate abortion providers, but never looked at Gosnell despite specific complaints from lawyers, a doctor, and a medical examiner. After she was nonetheless promoted, her successor as division director, Cynthia Boyne, failed to order an investigation of the clinic even when Karnamaya Mongar died there. Senior legal counsel Kenneth Brody insisted that the department had no legal obligation to monitor abortion clinics, even though it exercised such a duty until the Ridge administration, and exercised it again as soon as Gosnell became big news. The agency’s head lawyer, chief counsel Christine Dutton, defended the department’s indifference: 'People die,' she said.” [...] “Lawyers at the Pennsylvania Department of State behaved in the same fashion. Attorneys Mark Greenwald, Charles Hartwell, David Grubb, Andrew Kramer, William Newport, Juan Ruiz, and Kerry Maloney were confronted with a growing pile of disquieting facts about Gosnell, including a detailed, inside account from a former employee (Marcella Choung, 2001), and a 22-year-old dead woman.

It [...] "says" [...] more things to you than you can repeat to see the past, the ancient world, as you stand there, bodily turned up with the spade and transformed from an <b>immaterial,</b> inaccessible <b>fact</b> of time into a matter of soils and surfaces. The pleasure is the same--in kind--as what you enjoy of Pompeii, and the pain the same. It wasn't here, however, that I found my compensation for forfeiting the spectacle on the Corso, but in a little church {{at the end of the}} narrow byway which diverges up the Palatine from just beside the Arch of Titus. This byway leads you between high walls, then takes a bend and introduces you to a long row of rusty, dusty little pictures of the stations of the cross. Beyond these stands a small church with a front so modest that you hardly recognise it till you see the leather curtain. I never see a leather curtain without lifting it; it is sure to cover a constituted scene of some sort--good, bad or indifferent. The scene this time was meagre--whitewash and tarnished candlesticks and mouldy muslin flowers being its principal features. I shouldn't have remained if I hadn't been struck with the attitude of the single worshipper--a young priest kneeling before one of the sidealtars, who, as I entered, lifted his head and gave me a sidelong look so charged with the languor of devotion that he immediately became an object of interest. He was visiting each of the altars in turn and kissing the balustrade beneath them. He was alone in the church, and indeed in the whole region. There were no beggars even at the door; they were plying their trade on the skirts of the Carnival. In the entirely deserted place he alone knelt for religion, and as I sat respectfully by it seemed to me I could hear in the perfect silence the far-away uproar of the maskers. It was my late impression of these frivolous people, I suppose, joined with the extraordinary gravity of the young priest's face- -his pious fatigue, his droning prayer and his isolation--that gave me just then and there a supreme vision of the religious passion, its privations and resignations and exhaustions and its terribly small share of amusement. He was young and strong and evidently of not too refined a fibre to enjoy the Carnival; but, planted there with his face pale with fasting and his knees stiff with praying, he seemed so stern a satire on it and on the crazy thousands who were preferring it to his way, that I half expected to see some heavenly portent out of a monastic legend come down and confirm his choice. Yet I confess that though I wasn't enamoured of the Carnival myself, his seemed a grim preference and this forswearing of the world a terrible game--a gaining one only if your zeal never falters; a hard fight when it does. In such an hour, to a stout young fellow like the hero of my anecdote, the smell of incense must seem horribly stale and the muslin flowers and gilt candlesticks to figure no great bribe. And it wouldn't have helped him much to think that not so very far away, just beyond the Forum, in the Corso, there was sport for the million, and for nothing. I doubt on the other hand whether my young priest had thought of this. He had made himself a temple out of the very elements of his innocence, and his prayers followed each other too fast for the tempter to slip in a whisper. And so, as I say, I found a solider fact of human nature than the love of coriandoli.|$|R
