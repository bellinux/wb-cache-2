500|$|As {{a result}} of the controversy, in September of that year, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission {{announced}} that Canadian content rules would be changed.

[...] Though the video was met with widespread praise, it was also criticized for its content. In 1982, the National Coalition on Television Violence (NCTV) classified {{more than half of}} 200 MTV music videos surveyed as [...] "too violent". Both [...] "Thriller" [...] and Jackson's duet with Paul McCartney, [...] "Say, Say, Say" [...] made the list.

In both his autobiography and his book, On Acting, he credits William Wyler with teaching him how to act in films, as opposed to on the stage, and for giving him a new respect for films. Olivier had tended to [...] "ham it up", as if he were playing to the second balcony, but Wyler showed him how to act more subtly - in part by simply wearing him down.|$|R
