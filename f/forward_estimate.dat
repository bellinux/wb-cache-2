40|$|Aims] A new {{approach}} is proposed to estimate fine root production, mortality, and decomposition that occur simultaneously in terrestrial ecosystems utilizing sequential soil core sampling or ingrowth core techniques. [Methods] The calculation assumes {{knowledge of the}} decomposition rate of dead fine roots during a given time period from a litter bag experiment. A mass balance model of organic matter derived from live fine roots is applied with an assumption about fine root mortality and decomposition to estimate decomposed dead fine roots from variables that can be quantified. [Results] Comparison of the estimated fine root dynamics with the decision matrix method and three new methods (<b>forward</b> <b>estimate,</b> continuous inflow estimate, and backward estimate) in a ca. 80 -year-old Chamaecyparis obtusa plantation in central Japan showed that the decision matrix nearly always underestimated production, mortality, and decomposition by underscoring {{the values of the}} <b>forward</b> <b>estimate,</b> which theoretically underestimates the true value. The fine root production and mortality obtained by the decision matrix were on average 14 % and 38 % lower than those calculated by the continuous inflow estimate method. In addition, the values by the continuous inflow estimate method were always between those calculated by the <b>forward</b> <b>estimate</b> and backward estimate methods. The latter is known to overestimate the true value. [Conclusions] Therefore, we consider that the continuous inflow estimate method provides the best estimates of fine root production, mortality, and decomposition among the four approaches compared...|$|E

In {{addition to its}} direct contributions, it drives productivity gains throughout the economy according to this 2007 Access Economics report. The {{mobile telecommunications}} industry contributes substantially to the Australian economy. In addition to its direct contributions, it drives productivity gains throughout the economy. This characteristic of the mobile telecommunications industry contrasts with other key sectors such as mining, which makes a significant direct contribution to the economy but much smaller indirect contributions. The report says the direct contribution of the mobile telecommunications industry to the Australian economy in 2005 - 06 was $ 5. 8 billion, with its share of value added to the whole communications industry found to be 24. 9 %. Access Economics says the indirect or spill-over effects of mobile telecommunications on the broader Gross Domestic Product {{is estimated to be}} $ 6. 4 billion – greater than the direct economic impact. The ubiquity of mobiles has transformed the way businesses operate and their employees work in almost every industry and sector of the Australian economy.

40|$|During {{goal-directed}} movements, primates {{are able}} to rapidly and accurately control a movement despite substantial delay times (more than 200 milliseconds) incurred in the sensorimotor control loop. To compensate for these large delays, it has been proposed that the brain uses an internal forward model of the arm to estimate current and upcoming states of a movement, which would be more useful for rapid online control. To study online control mechanisms in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), we recorded from single neurons while monkeys performed a joystick task.

Recent advances in cortical prosthetics have focused on recording neural activity in motor cortices and decoding these signals to control the trajectory of a cursor on a computer screen. Building on our encoding results, we demonstrate that joystick-controlled trajectories can also be decoded from PPC ensembles, presumably extracting the dynamic state of the cursor from a forward model. Remarkably, we found that we could accurately reconstruct a monkey’s trajectories using only 5 simultaneously recorded PPC neurons. Furthermore, we tested whether we could decode trajectories during closed-loop brain control sessions, in which the real-time position of the cursor was determined solely by a monkey’s thoughts.

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} design, construction, {{and the initial}} results {{obtained}} from a digital spectrograph for observations of radio burst emission from the Sun. One of the distinct advantages of radio spectral studies of the Sun during events such as solar flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), etc. is that it gives a straight <b>forward</b> <b>estimate</b> {{of the speed of}} the outflowing material into the outer atmosphere of the Sun and subsequently the interplanetary medium. It is well known that in the solar atmosphere, the electron density and consequently the plasma frequency gradually decreases with increasing distance from the center. Therefore in a time-frequency plane, the intensity of the associated radio emission should generally drift from high to low frequencies with time. From this, and from a knowledge of the height of the successive plasma levels in the solar atmosphere, one can deduce the speed of the outward moving disturbance. In this respect, a study of the radio bursts at decameter wavelengths is important since such radiation originates from the corona at heights ≥ 1. 3 R⊙ (1 R⊙ = 6. 96 x 10 ° km = radius of the Sun) {{from the center of the}} Sun, which are otherwise accessible only through the use of white light coronagraphs atop high altitude mountains and onboard space vehicles. The primary units of the instrument are (i) zero-crossing detector (ZCD), (ii) sampler and (iii) correlator. The function of the ZCD is to digitize the input signal waveform. In the present case, we use a one-bit quantizer, i. e., its output is either a ' 1 ' or ' 0 ' depending on whether the input is above or below the zero level, respectively. The digitized signals are then sampled at the Nyquist rate using the sampler. The output of the sampler is then passed through a set of shift registers, and finally fed to the correlator. The latter measures the correlation between the signals at its input as a function of the delay (introduced by the shift registers) between them. After successful completion of several static/dynamic tests in the laboratory, the system was moved to the Gauribidanur radio observatory (Latitude: 13 ° 36 ’ 12 ”; Longitude: 77 ° 27 ’ 07 ”), and is presently used along with the existing radiohe-liograph to derive both the spectral and spatial information of the various radio emitting transient sources on the Sun, respectively. The R [...] F. signal (40 - 150 MHz) from one of the antenna groups of the ra-dioheliograph forms the input to the spectrograph. The signal from the field goes through a series of amplification and mixing operations to bring it down to an I. F. of 10 MHz with a bandwidth of 1 MHz, and then fed to the spectrograph. The present frequency range of the spectrograph is 40 MHz, and the data corresponding to the above band is obtained in steps of 1 MHz by switching the local oscillator through a GPIB interface, after each integration period. Each 1 MHz data is then Fourier tranformed to get its corresponding power spectrum. Successive data sets are then arranged in order according to the frequency of the local oscillator signal to get the spectrum corresponding to the entire 40 MHz band. The initial results obtained with our instrument are also presented...|$|E

Assuming that occluded pixels are visible in the previous frame, the optical flow on non-occluded pixels is <b>forward</b> <b>estimated</b> whereas is backwards estimated on the occluded ones.

40|$|This policy brief {{presents}} {{a number of}} scenarios to illustrate {{the impact on the}} budget from the Emissions Reduction Fund and removing the carbon price. Summary The Government proposes to remove the current legislated carbon price and replace it with its taxpayer-funded Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF). Over the four years of <b>forward</b> <b>estimates,</b> this is projected to have a negative fiscal impact of over $ 15 billion. To 2020, the negative impact grows to over $ 24 billion if ERF expenditure is capped. It reaches over $ 40 billion if pollution reduction targets are to be reached and if the Government doesn’t amend its position of purchasing only Australian emission reductions for its minimum target commitment. This multibillion dollar hit on the budget stems from two sources: 	Emissions  Reduction Fund: Over the <b>forward</b> <b>estimates,</b> the Government has indicated it would spend $ 2. 55 billion of taxpayer funds to subsidise emission reduction activities. In the past, the Government has indicated that the scheme will be scaled up to an average $ 1. 2 billion a year. 	Loss of  carbon pricing revenue: The payment by major polluting companies of next year’s fixed carbon price and their subsequent purchase of carbon pollution permits under the emission trading scheme due to start in 2015 is a significant source of Government revenue. The current carbon laws conservatively raise over $ 18 billion to 2020. The budgetary impact form the loss of carbon revenue not only threatens funds now supporting clean energy, low emission programs, technology research and development, as well as support for households and business, but also affects broader choices. The Climate Institute has calculated the net fiscal hit under a number of scenarios, to illustrate the impact on the budget from the ERF and removing the carbon price. Under all budget constrained scenarios, ERF funding is assumed to follow the spending outlined in Coalition policy documents. These scenarios do not address the approximately $ 24 billion annual subsidy that the International Monetary Fund estimates Australian governments gives the coal, oil and gas industries...|$|R
