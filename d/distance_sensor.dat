40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} the assessment of the potential of laser <b>distance</b> <b>sensors</b> for measuring morphologic crop parameters to perform site specific crop management. In a first step five pre-selected laser sensors were tested. Based on these results a triangulation laser sensor was chosen and modified. The modified sensor was tested in terms of the accuracy for distance measurements depending on the inclination angle of the plant surface and the rate of failure measurements depending on illumination conditions and measuring distance. Under defined lab condition the mean distance standard error was 2. 8 mm. The inclination angle of the plant surfaces did not reduce the measuring accuracy. Bright sunshine and intensive reflecting surfaces (e. g., sandy soils) without crop coverage caused increased failure measurements. Taking into account all test results a potential of laser <b>distance</b> <b>sensors</b> for measuring of morphologic crop parameters was proved...|$|R

The belt, called viSparsh combination of vision and sparsh(touch), can assist people with visual impairment in their daily activities. The fellows developed this low-cost <b>distance</b> <b>sensor</b> in collaboration with the School of Engineering & Applied Science -University of Pennsylvania. It has an infrared optic sensor that projects thousands of dots in a three to 12 feet distance to determine obstacles present. Based on the proximity and relative direction of the obstacles to the wearer, a series of vibrators on the belt alert the wearer of their presence and provides a 160 degree view of the environment. It is lightweight, low-cost (~Rs 5,000), easy to use, non-conspicuous and hands and ear-free. The belt will be wearable, affordable and practical for a visually impaired person. Team viSparsh won several accolades for their invention including Accenture Innovation Jockeys-2012, Economics Times: Power of Ideas-2012 and Outstanding Experience Learning Award-2012.
