40|$|Biodegradable self-reinforced poly-L/DL-lactide {{plates and}} screws {{were used for}} osteosynthesis in 10 {{consecutive}} cases of bimaxillary procedures with simultaneous <b>genioplasties,</b> without postoperative rigid intermaxillary fixation. During surgery, data were gathered concerning failure of the osteosynthesis material. Clinical examination was carried out weekly until the sixth postoperative week. Cephalometric analysis of standardized cephalograms was performed to evaluate the short-term skeletal stability pattern, which was compared with similar reports in the literature. Six weeks postoperatively, all jaws were clinically stable {{and there was no}} clinical evidence of foreign body reactions. For the whole group (n = 10), the mean maxillary advancement at point A was 2. 9 mm with a mean postoperative relapse of 0. 0 mm. The mean advancement at point B was 2. 8 mm with a mean additional advancement postoperatively of 1. 1 mm. The mean vertical surgical displacement at point A was directed inferiorly with a value of 1. 8 mm and a relapse of - 0. 4 mm. At point B the corresponding values were 1. 9 mm and - 0. 4 mm. In the Angle Class III group (n = 4), the mean advancement at A was 5. 9 mm with an additional postoperative advancement of 0. 3 mm. In the Angle Class II group (n = 6), mean advancement at point B was 4. 0 mm, with an additional postoperative advancement of 1. 1 mm. In the group with short face deformity (n = 3), the mean inferior movement in ANS was 6. 6 mm with a relapse of - 0. 2 mm. At menton the vertical surgical movement was 13. 0 mm with a relapse of - 0. 2 mm. None of the plates, which were bent at room temperature, broke. The screw heads broke or had an insufficient fit in the bone in 12 of 305 (3. 9 %) screws. It can be concluded that the tested system of biodegradable self-reinforced poly-L/DL-lactide screws and plates has a small material-related failure rate, and that their application in orthognathic surgery leads to a predictable short-term skeletal stability pattern which is comparable to the 'gold standard' of titanium plates and screws...|$|R

Then, soft tissue of the mandible is detached from the bone; done by stripping attaching tissues. A horizontal incision is then made inferior to the first bicuspids, bilaterally, where bone cuts (osteotomies) are made vertically inferior, extending to the inferior border of the mandible, thereby detaching the bony segments of the mandible. The bony segments are stabilized with titanium plates; no fixation (binding of the jaw) necessary. If advancement is indicated for the chin, there are inert products available to implant onto the mandible, utilizing titanium screws, bypassing bone cuts.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The chin (mentum) {{is vital}} to the human facial {{morphology}} as it contributes to the facial aesthetics and harmony both on frontal and lateral views. Osseous <b>genioplasty,</b> the alteration of the chin through skeletal modification, can lead to significant enhancement of the overall facial profile. Aim and Study Design: A case series was designed to study the long-term results of osseous <b>genioplasty</b> in Indian patients with regard to patient satisfaction, complications, and long-term stability. Materials and Methods: All subjects who underwent osseous <b>genioplasty</b> either alone or as a component of orthognathic surgery between January 1992 and December 2010, with a minimum follow-up of 2 years, were included. The <b>genioplasty</b> was performed using standard protocols of assessment and execution. Post-operative evaluation included patient satisfaction, complications and radiological evidence of long-term stability. A comprehensive score was formulated for the purpose of the study. Results: Thirty-seven subjects underwent osseous <b>genioplasty</b> with at least 2 years of follow-up in the study period. This included 17 male and 20 female subjects, {{with a mean age of}} 22. 8 years (15 - 52 years) and a mean follow-up of 3 years 4 months (2 years to 4 years and 11 months). Nineteen subjects underwent isolated <b>genioplasty</b> while 18 underwent <b>genioplasty</b> as a part of orthognathic surgery. The procedures included advancement (22), pushback (9), side-to-side (4) and vertical reduction (2) <b>genioplasty.</b> Thirty-six subjects (97. 3 %) were extremely pleased with the results with only one subject expressing reservations, without, however, demanding any further procedure. There were no significant complications. The osteotomised segment was well maintained in its new position with good bony union and minimal resorption. Overall, 35 (94. 6 %) cases had excellent results and 2 (4. 4 %) cases had good results, according to the comprehensive score. Conclusions: Osseous <b>genioplasty</b> is a safe and effective means of creating a beautiful and balanced facial profile by producing alterations in the chin morphology with minimal complications and excellent and stable long-term results...|$|E
30|$|Practically, then, {{it may be}} {{more helpful}} to perform a {{simulation}} surgery and then manufacture guides using a 3 D printer. Polley et al. reported various CAD/CAM-based surgical guides for use in orthognathic surgeries [4]. Among these devices, those used in <b>genioplasty</b> required more accurate mandibular dental data, and were more complex to design, compared to the method that we now describe [4, 8]. The usefulness of STL guides may also depend on the surgeons’ expertise, and the type of <b>genioplasty,</b> such as zigzag <b>genioplasty</b> [10 – 12].|$|E
30|$|Surgical {{simulations}} {{provide the}} opportunity to derive a more accurate preoperative diagnosis and then plan and simulate surgery. Success at this stage {{is more likely to}} lead to the esthetic and functional outcomes desired [6, 7]. For our purposes, several surgical devices can be used to establish the osteotomy line and measure the movement of the chin bone in a <b>genioplasty</b> [4, 6, 7]. In this study, we assessed one method of <b>genioplasty,</b> in which we performed a 3 D surgical simulation of a mandibular <b>genioplasty</b> [8]. By simulating the osteotomy on a 3 D model, we predicted the movements of the cut chin bone and used these data to 3 D-print a surgical guiding device. This device could then be used in an actual <b>genioplasty</b> to guide the osteotomy and move the cut bone segment to the intended location.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determinate}} how orthognatic surgery aids to cure many skull and face abnormalities and to help re-establishing the correct occlusive relation thanks to the repositioning of the maxillo-mandibular skeleton basis. Methods: The study included 183 male patients and 338 female patients, with an average age of 23 years. The sample series was divided according to specific pathologies. All patients underwent surgical procedures and the therapeutic strategy was determined based on the anomalies presented. Results: 113 patients had a II class dental skeletal occlusion, 180 patients had a III class dental-skeletal occlusion and 222 patients had skull-facial abnormalities. 5 patients underwent only a <b>genioplasty,</b> 82 patients underwent a <b>genioplasty</b> associated with BSSO, 175 patients underwent a <b>genioplasty</b> associated with Le Fort I osteotomy and the remaining 253 patients underwent a <b>genioplasty</b> associated with BSSO and Le Fort I osteotomy.

The patients with sagittal split osteotomies alone reported sensory disturbance in 48 / 131 (37 %) operated sides. When combined with <b>genioplasty</b> patients experienced them in 20 / 54 (37 %) operated sides.

30|$|In this respect, some {{well-known}} techniques seek {{to correct}} the shape {{and size of the}} chin using different kinds of chin implants or osteotomies in an effort to modify its spatial location, thus determining a new facial contour. <b>Genioplasty</b> is a versatile surgical technique which allows modifying the natural anatomy of the chin along all the three spatial directions. It was first described in the 1940 s by Hofer, who referred to it as an “anterior horizontal osteotomy of the mandible.” In some patients in need of advancement <b>genioplasty,</b> a horizontal bony movement of the chin may result in unwanted changes in soft tissue envelope. This is especially true in short-faced patients with deep mentolabial fold and lower lip eversion; advancement <b>genioplasty</b> in this population may indeed accentuate the depth of the mentolabial fold [5 – 7].|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{description of}} the changes and stability after <b>genioplasty</b> in a cross-sectional sample of 19 patients who had advancement <b>genioplasty</b> is presented. Euclidean distance matrix analysis (EDMA) of five cephalometric landmarks {{was used to assess}} these changes. During the first 6 months after surgery, bone deposition occurred at B point and pogonion, with bone resorption at the superior and posteroinferior aspects of the advanced segment. The genial segment rotated slightly anticlockwise. The authors believe this to be due to the action of the mentalis muscles. The stability of the advanced segment was excellent when assessed 1 year after surgery. The Euclidean distance matrix method can be used to assess shape changes and does not require cephalographic superimposition. It can also distinguish repositioning from remodelling and the changes of <b>genioplasty</b> from those of concomitant orthognathic surgery...|$|E
40|$|Background Patients seeking {{orthodontic}} treatment are usually eager to receive precise information about and objectives: the facial changes that surgical intervention may bring about. Predictions provide a realistic {{estimate of the}} outcome of anticipated surgery. It is also an important tool for treatment planning by the clinician.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze the accuracy of prediction for mandibular advancement with vertical reduction augmentation <b>genioplasty</b> using the ratios given in the previous studies. Method: Presurgical and postsurgical lateral cephalograms of 15 patients who had undergone mandibular advancement and vertical reduction augmentation <b>genioplasty</b> were obtained. Paired t-test was used to compare between presurgical prediction and postsurgical outcome. A ′P′ value of < 0. 05 was set for statistical significance. Results: Findings of this study demonstrate that there is no considerable difference between the predicted finding and the actual postsurgical outcome for mandibular advancement and <b>genioplasty.</b> Previous studies have shown that <b>genioplasty</b> along with mandibular advancement is a stable surgical procedure when rigid fixation is used.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Advancement <b>genioplasty</b> {{has been}} {{increasingly}} indicated for the correction of anterior mandibular deficiency as it balances the patient's profile and generates functional changes. OBJECTIVE: Thus, {{the aim of}} this study was to assess the effects of advancement <b>genioplasty</b> in the oropharyngeal size and in the position of the hyoid bone and tongue. METHODS: The sample comprised 22 lateral cephalometric radiographs of 11 individuals who had undergone advancement <b>genioplasty</b> alone. Eleven of these radiographs depicted the immediate preoperative period (T 0) and the other 11 the postoperative period after at least four months (T 1). The radiographs were scanned and exported to the Radiocef Studio 2. 0 ® software (Radio Memory Ltda., Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil). The landmarks were then identified and automatically measured by the program. RESULTS: The results showed statistically significant differences between the horizontal position of the hyoid bone and tongue and in the oropharyngeal size. The hyoid bone and tongue were repositioned anteriorly after surgery (p = 0. 01), thereby increasing the dimension of the oropharyngeal airspace (p = 0. 01).
