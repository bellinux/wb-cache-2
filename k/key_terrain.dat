5|$|On 2 March, Tolson {{laid out}} {{what became known}} as Operation Pegasus. The {{operational}} plan for what was to become the largest operation launched by III MAF thus far in the conflict. The 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment (2/1 Marines) and the 2/3 Marines would launch a ground assault from Ca Lu (16 kilometers east of Khe Sanh) and head west on Route 9 while the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Brigades of the 1st Cavalry Division, would air-assault <b>key</b> <b>terrain</b> features along Route 9 to establish fire support bases and cover the Marine advance. The advance would be supported by 102 pieces of artillery. The Marines would be accompanied by their 11th Engineer Battalion, which would repair the road as the advance moved forward. Later, the 1/1 Marines and 3rd ARVN Airborne Task Force (the 3rd, 6th and 8th Airborne Battalions) would join the operation.|$|E

25|$|In late February 1944, {{after the}} Japanese {{launched}} a counter-offensive against the Indian 5th Infantry Division in the Arakan, both No. 5 and No. 44 (Royal Marine) Commandos were {{moved back to}} Bombay and embarking on HMS Keren they were sent to Cox's Bazar. They arrived there on 5 March, by which time the British and Indian units in Burma had managed to stop the Japanese counter-offensive and had themselves resumed offensive operations. As Indian XV Corps cleared the Maungdaw–Buthidaung road, the commandos landed behind the Japanese near Alethangaw on 11 March 1944. For {{a couple of weeks}} they carried out patrols in the Japanese rear before being recalled to Maungdaw on 23 March, where No. 5 Commando carried out a number of attacks on <b>key</b> <b>terrain.</b>|$|E
500|$|The counterattack {{drew to a}} {{close on}} 27March, as Hyakutake gave the order for his forces to cease the attack and withdraw. As they began to move, {{elements}} of the Japanese 6th Cavalry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, 4th South Seas Garrison Unit, acted as a screening force to cover their movement. The next day Hill 260 was retaken by elements of the Americal Division. Meanwhile, the Japanese withdrew, largely in an orderly fashion, moving back to the positions that they had occupied prior to the battle commencing. In the following weeks, the US forces expanded their perimeter further, harassing the Japanese. This operation sought to occupy <b>key</b> <b>terrain</b> and establish outposts and blocking positions along predicted Japanese avenues of advance, and involved the African American troops [...] of the 24th Infantry Regiment and 93rd Infantry Division who were committed to battle to gain experience.|$|E
500|$|Elsewhere, in the north-east, {{closer to}} the coast, the {{establishment}} of observation posts on <b>key</b> <b>terrain</b> overlooking Japanese main supply routes by Australian forces began affecting the supply situation of the Japanese forces around Sattelberg, as supply parties were ambushed as they attempted to bring up food and ammunition. The Australians were also short of supplies and, as a result, they paused on 21 November while supplies were brought up to them, before the advance resumed the following day. The main thrust aimed for a jink where the track turned north. Here the 2/48th turned to the north-east, while the 2/23rd left the track and began advancing north-west towards the [...] "3200" [...] feature, which lay west of Sattelberg; the 2/24th, coming up against increasingly steep terrain and very strong Japanese defences around the 2200 feature, unsuccessfully attempted to bypass the position and strike towards Sattelberg. The same day, in the north, the Japanese attempted another counterattack on 22 November, aiming to relieve the supply situation around Sattelberg and to recapture Finschhafen. The counterattack failed, as it was blunted by the Australian depth position around Pabu and, lacking the tempo of the earlier counterattack in October, it was ultimately beaten back, with little affect on Australian operations around Sattelberg.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Australians had landed at Scarlet Beach in late September, {{they began to}} patrol the area north of there towards Bonga and Gusika. Several key tracks and {{junctions}} were located by troops from the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion, who named them [...] "Imperial", [...] "Oriental", [...] "Norfolk" [...] and [...] "Exchange", after Adelaide pubs. Through the use of aerial reconnaissance evidence {{was found that the}} Japanese were using these tracks to traverse the area and to move supplies west towards Sattelberg. Observation posts were established and it became apparent to the Australians that one hill in particular, a feature later dubbed [...] "Pabu" [...] by the Australians after one of their native scouts, was the <b>key</b> <b>terrain</b> in the area. Part of an area that later became known as [...] "Horace the Horse" [...] to the Australians due to its shape as viewed from the air, it was within artillery range of the Australian forward positions at North Hill and as such could be occupied and held by a small party who could then disrupt the Japanese supply line. In October, the Japanese had launched a counter-attack in the region and as the Australians had been forced back, they were forced to abandon Pabu.|$|E
500|$|The Australians {{managed to}} hold <b>key</b> <b>terrain</b> around Jivevaneng and Katika from where the Allies {{employed}} their direct and indirect fire support to inflict heavy casualties. Nevertheless, the Japanese achieved a degree of tactical success, albeit briefly. On 18 October, a party of Japanese broke through to Siki Cove, where Australian anti-aircraft gunners and artillerymen were forced to fire over [...] "open sights" [...] and fight back with small arms, after coming under fire from troops that had gotten under the guns. That night, the Japanese cut the 2/17th Infantry Battalion's supply route, establishing a road block astride the Jivevaneng–Sattelberg road, and cutting off the Australians defending Jivevaneng. The 2/17th {{and a number of}} other Australian units, such as most of the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion, as well as part of the 2/28th, became isolated behind Japanese lines. [...] In order to keep them supplied, emergency air drops of ammunition were flown in by pilots of No. 4 Squadron RAAF. Presented with the ambiguity of the situation, the commander of the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion withdrew one of his outposts, while Brigadier Bernard Evans, commander of the 24th Infantry Brigade, also contracted his position around the beachhead, and in doing so subsequently granted the Japanese the prime position of Katika. The Australian divisional commander, Wootten, was enraged by the decision and subsequently lambasted his commander via radio. In response, the 2/13th Infantry Battalion detached two companies from rear area security and sent them north, while the 2/28th Infantry Battalion launched a counterattack against the Japanese around Katika, which– supported by artillery– successfully regained the position.|$|E

2500|$|Overcoming {{significant}} command ambiguities between American and Australian forces {{because of}} overlapping spheres of operation, Roosevelt {{played an important}} role in the Salamaua campaign.

2500|$|By the {{conclusion}} of the Piva Forks fighting, US forces were in control {{of the majority of the}} <b>key</b> <b>terrain</b> and high features that existed west of the Torokina River. These reduced the Japanese force's ability to harass the US beachhead around Torokina and as a result although the fighting on Bougainville continued with notable actions being fought at Koiari and Hellzapoppin Ridge and Hill 600A, in the words of historian Samuel Morison, [...] "the Battle of Piva Forks...was the last serious ground resistance for a long time". Indeed, it was not until March 1944 that the Japanese were able to make any real attempt at counterattacking when they launched a large-scale offensive on the American perimeter with 15,000 troops drawn from the 6th and 17th Divisions who attacked north and west from Buin and Numa–Numa.|$|E
2500|$|At 11:00 A.M. on 11 May, Billotte {{diverted}} {{most of the}} French 23rd Fighter Group (Fighter Groupement 23) {{to cover}} the advance of the First Army and its neighbouring units. After more fighters had been removed for bomber escort missions, few fighters were left to cover the cavalry. The Allied bombers concentrated on retarding the dangerous advance of Hoepner's Panzers. Prioux's ground reconnaissances fell back before the Panzers, toward {{the main body of}} French cavalry, which was established in strongpoints along a 40km front with the 2d DLM from Huy on the Meuse and north, then westward along the Mehaigne creek. The 3d DLM formed a front from the area of Crehen to Orp and then northward along the Petite Gette stream to the area of Tirlemont. The battleground which Prioux chose consisted of a plateau with occasional woods, a dense road network, extended localities and a few isolated large farms. The Mehaigne and Petite Gette were small streams flowing within two-to-three-meter-deep rock cuts with many crossing points, often fordable by tracked vehicles, and offering good cover for would-be infiltrators. But the <b>key</b> <b>terrain</b> feature was the ridge running from Hannut through Crehen and Merdorp. [...] North of the ridge, the Petite Gette flowed north into the Escaut river, south of it, the Mehaigne flowed south into the Meuse. This ridge formed a natural corridor for mechanized forces.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A set G {{of points}} on a 1. 5 -dimensional terrain, {{also known as}} an x-monotone {{polygonal}} chain, is said to guard the terrain if every point on the terrain is seen by a point in G. Two points on the terrain see each other {{if and only if}} the line segment between them is never strictly below the terrain. The minimum terrain guarding problem asks for a minimum guarding set for the given input terrain. Using a reduction from PLANAR 3 -SAT we prove that the decision version of this problem is NP-hard.

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1863, Lee invaded the North again, marching through western Maryland and into south central Pennsylvania. He {{encountered}} Union forces under George G. Meade at the three-day Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania in July; the battle would produce {{the largest number of}} casualties in the American Civil War. With some of his subordinates being new and inexperienced in their commands, J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry being out of the area, and Lee being slightly ill, he was less than comfortable with how events were unfolding. While the first day of battle was controlled by the Confederates, <b>key</b> <b>terrain</b> that should have been taken by General Ewell was not. The second day ended with the Confederates unable to break the Union position, and the Union being more solidified. Lee's decision on the third day, against the judgment of his best corps commander General Longstreet, to launch a massive frontal assault on the center of the Union line turned out to be disastrous. The assault known as Pickett's Charge was repulsed and resulted in heavy Confederate losses. The general rode out to meet his retreating army and proclaimed, [...] "All this has been my fault." [...] Lee was compelled to retreat. Despite flooded rivers that blocked his retreat, he escaped Meade's ineffective pursuit. Following his defeat at Gettysburg, Lee sent a letter of resignation to President Davis on August 8, 1863, but Davis refused Lee's request. That fall, Lee and Meade met again in two minor campaigns that did little to change the strategic standoff. The Confederate Army never fully recovered from the substantial losses incurred during the 3-day battle in southern Pennsylvania. The historian Shelby Foote stated, [...] "Gettysburg was the price the South paid for having Robert E. Lee as commander." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Terrain {{generation}} algorithms have {{an important}} role in video games: they can provide a realistic scenario for the game experience, or can help keep the user interested in playing by providing new landscapes each time he plays. Nowadays there are a wide range of techniques for terrain generation, but all of them are focused on providing realistic terrains, often neglecting other aspects (e. g., aesthetic appeal or presence of desired features). This paper proposes a new technique, Genetic Terrain Programming, based on evolutionary design with GP to allow game designers to evolve terrains accordingly to their aesthetic feelings or desired features. The developed application produces Terrains Programs (TPs) that will always generate different terrains, but consistently with the same features (e. g. valleys, lakes). This characteristic will allow game designers to endow games with programs capable of generating different coherent landscapes each time users run the game. <b>Key</b> words: <b>terrain</b> generation, video games, evolutionary art, genetic programming...|$|R
40|$|The high {{mobility}} of Army tactical networks, combined with their {{close proximity to}} hostile actors, elevates {{the risks associated with}} short-range network attacks. The connectivity model for such short range connections under active operations is extremely fluid, and highly dependent upon the physical space within which the element is operating, as well as the patterns of movement within that space. To handle these dependencies, we introduce the notion of "key cyber-physical terrain": locations within an area of operations that allow for effective control over the spread of proximity-dependent malware in a mobile tactical network, even as the elements of that network are in constant motion with an unpredictable pattern of node-to-node connectivity. We provide an analysis of movement models and approximation strategies for finding such critical nodes, and demonstrate via simulation that we can identify such <b>key</b> cyber-physical <b>terrain</b> quickly and effectively.
