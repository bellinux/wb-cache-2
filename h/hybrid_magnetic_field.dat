40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to develop <b>hybrid</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> sensors and to compare those with HTS SQUID Sensors in the field of non {{destructive}} testing on power plant relevant materials and test structures. The project started with commercial available converters combined with magnetic antenna in order to find the current state of technology and to become sensitive for the most promising converter in this field. A parallel development was running applying thin film superconducting antennas integrated to Hall type thin film converter. Both developments finally lad {{to the conclusion that the}} most promising solution would be to focus on AMR-converter combined with integrated magnetic antenna. As a consequence special purpose AMR-converters were designed, prepared and characterised at room temperature and at cryogenic temperature as well. The best performance was obtained at room temperature. Typical sensitivities between 10 and 100 V/T could be obtained without antenna. The field and field gradient resolution under the same conditions ranged between 20 to 80 pT/#sq root#(Hz) and 50 to 200 pT/cm #sq root#(Hz). Magnetic antennas were flip chip coupled to the converter and improved the field resolution to 1, 5 pT/#sq root#(Hz) at room temperature and for frequencies above 1000 Hz. In a final study the sensors without antenna were applied in non destructive testing of steel and aluminium test objects and compared with the results obtained with SQUID sensors and induction coils on the same objects. The results with the induction coil, optimised for low frequency application, were performed on the same system as the hybrid sensors and showed a superior performance of the hybrid sensor for frequencies below 200 Hz. So the detection of deep defects is profitably done with <b>hybrid</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> sensors. Moreover as soon as antennas are implemented in the hybrid sensor, the frequency range with superior performance will increase up to at least 2 kHz. The SQUID measurements were done on the same test objects with a different system. The SQUID system could not take full advantage of the very high SQUID resolution due to a noise mismatch with the electronics and the influence of disturbing external fields at the measuring site. In practice the results with the SQUID system were rather comparable to the results obtained with the hybrid sensors. (orig.)

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Physics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The {{existence}} of a Fisk-type heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) {{is one of the}} most debated questions in cosmic-ray modulation. Recently, Burger and Hitge [2004] developed a divergence-free Fisk-Parker <b>hybrid</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> model to demonstrate the behaviour of cosmic rays in the heliosphere due to such a field. This approach has been refined and the properties of the consequent field are investigated. It is found that randomly directed magnetic field diffusion in and above the photosphere significantly influences the solar magnetic field both at the solar poles and near the polar coronal hole boundary. The solar cycle dependence of this field is investigated, a study which is of particular importance for studies of the long-term behaviour of cosmic rays, such as those undertaken at the SANAE base in Antarctica. The amplitudes of the 26 -day recurrent cosmic-ray variations are modelled as function of both latitudinal gradient and heliolatitude and are found to agree qualitatively and in some cases quantitatively with the observational results reported by Zhang 119971 and Paizis et al. 119991. Although magnetic field data do not clearly indicate the {{existence of}} the Fisk field [see, e. g., Fursyth et al., 20021, this study supports the {{existence of a}} Fisk-type HMF. Master...|$|E
40|$|A 2. 0 cm {{internal}} diameter 1 m long, axially-rotating horizontal glass tube, with four axially located repeating hybrid magnetic units, {{is used as}} part of a flow-through, colloidal magnetic affinity separation device. Each magnetic unit consists of an alternating current solenoid surrounding the chamber followed by four azimuthally distributed permanent magnets that rotate with the chamber. The separation is demonstrated on a model feed system consisting of a mixture of 1. 0 μm diameter biotinylated latex beads (targets) and 9. 7 μm diameter non-functionalized latex beads (non-targets) at a 1 : 1 number ratio. Two feed flow rates of 12 ml/min and 35 ml/min were used until a total of 600 ml of sample were processed for each. At the low rate we achieved capture efficiency 60 %, a separation factor of 18. 2 with 95 % purity. For the higher flow rate, the capture efficiency was 40 %, the separation factor 18. 6 with 87 % purity. ^ The same device also was used for removal of cadmium ions from a cadmium sulfate solution. Two arrangements for the magnetic units were used. In the first configuration, four hybrid pairs were distributed axially—each pair consisted of an alternating current carrying solenoid, followed by four azimuthally distributed permanent magnets that rotate with the chamber. In the second configuration, all four solenoids were placed first, followed by the four sets of four azimuthally distributed permanent magnets. 1 – 10 μm diameter magnetic particles with iron oxide nanoparticles embedded within a quaternary ammonium cellulose matrix (MagaCell-Q, Cortex Biochem) at a starting concentration of 0. 5 mg particles/mL were used as the mobile solid support. The feed consisted of a 10. 0 mg/L cadmium sulfate solution, at a flow rate of 35 mL/min. For the arrangement, the cadmium concentration at the exit of the third stage dropped to 0. 97 mg/L. The second configuration produced a final cadmium concentration of 0. 68 mg/L. For the first arrangement, three stage processing resulted in an overall ∼ 90 % w/w cadmium removal, and the second configuration removed ∼ 94 % of the original cadmium ions. The operating mode of this device requires a periodic interruption of the feed flow, leading to down time. Thus there is a compelling motivation {{to the development of the}} continuous device. ^ The continuous, <b>hybrid</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> gradient separation device, designed in our lab, incorporates a 1. 0 cm {{internal diameter}} 1 m long, axially-rotating horizontal glass tube, with four axially located repeating magnetic units. Each magnetic unit consists of an alternating current solenoid surrounding the chamber followed by electromagnets at a distance of 4. 0 cm from the end of the solenoid. A computer controlled DC current flowing in the electromagnet is used to generate radial magnetic field gradients within the tube, allowing magnetic particles to be drawn to the walls. MagaCell-Q magnetic particles were used to demonstrate the removal of cadmium ions from an aqueous solution. Three stage processing resulted in an overall ∼ 92 % cadmium removal. Thus, this breakthrough technology in continuous separation can lead to a large increase in processing volume and reduced down time compared to the flow-through device, without loss of removal efficiency. ^ While the specific system studied here consists of removal of cadmium ions from an aqueous solution, the general principle of magnetic colloidal separation using the flow-through and continuous devices can be exploited for other environmental and biotechnological applications where large volumes of sample must be processed with high efficiency. ...|$|E

However, the design of <b>hybrid</b> <b>magnetic</b> circuits containing additional permanent magnets or switchable hard magnets offers far-reaching perspectives in terms of fail-safe behaviour and energy efficiency. In this chapter, after a short introduction to the principles of MR fluids and magnetic circuits, MR devices with different magnetic circuit designs are described. The key feature of the design concepts is represented by the superposition of <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> from different <b>magnetic</b> sources in the MR fluid.

The main advantage is the improved fail-safe behavior of the damper in case of a power failure.

30|$|The {{last two}} columns in Table 1 show how much—in {{relative}} terms—the dipolar <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> values {{have changed the}} total ion loss rates compared with the non-magnetized case. Interestingly, the highest ionosphere O+ ion loss rate increase (35 %) and the highest ionosphere O 2 + ion loss rate increase (9 %) were obtained at the weakest 10 nT intrinsic <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> situation and neither in the non-magnetized case nor in the highest <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> case of 60 nT. The streamlines of oxygen ions (cf. Fig. 3) suggest {{that this may be}} related to relative size of the open and closed <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> line regions. In the non-magnetized case the radial component of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> at the exobase is zero which limits the escape of ions along the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> lines. The non-zero intrinsic <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> results in a nonzero radial <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> at the exobase enabling <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> aligned ion escape from the ionosphere through the magnetic cusps. But {{at the same time the}} increase of the dipolar <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> creates a closed <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> line region, inside which ions can be trapped. The increased <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> therefore both increases the loss of ions in certain regions (magnetic cusps) and reduces it in other regions (a closed <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> line region). The maximum total ion loss rate is obtained in the situation where the magnetic cusps enable <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> aligned ion loss but where the intrinsic <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> has not yet formed very large and strong closed field line region.|$|R

The magnet – a Halbach array consisting of several permanent magnets – is cylindrical {{with a hole in}} the centre. The special arrangement of these magnets concentrates the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> in the inner gap. The generated <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> was examined {{with the aid of a}} magnetovision system designed in our laboratory. The investigations confirmed that a <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> of 1 T is produced in the hole. In the magnetic pictures one can observe how the direction of <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> vector is changing. In addition, the influence of <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> screen on the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> range was analysed...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the shortcoming of magnetic bearings whereby general mathematical models of the radial suspension forces cannot be accurately established, a mathematical model considering the edge effect is set up. The configuration, operation principle and flux distribution features of a three-pole radial <b>hybrid</b> <b>magnetic</b> bearing (HMB) are analyzed in this paper. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> division method is employed to calculate the permeance of different regions around the end portion of poles. The total permeance of a single pole is composed of the permeance of the regions. Then, an accurate mathematical model of the radial suspension forces considering the edge effect is deduced by the equivalent magnetic circuit method. From the modeling procedures, {{it can be seen}} that the edge effect calculation is only related to the configuration and parameters of the magnetic poles, and is isolated with the other configurations and parameters of the three-pole radial HMB, therefore, the mathematical model is proved universal for calculating different suspension forces of <b>hybrid</b> <b>magnetic</b> bearings. A finite element analysis (FEA) simulation and three-pole radial HMB experiments are performed. The error between the theoretical calculation values and the FEA simulation values of the suspension forces is less than 5 %, and the error between theoretical calculation value and experimental value of suspension forces is less than 7 %. The comparison between the results of the theoretical calculation, FEA simulation and experiments has verified that the established mathematical model can accurately calculate the suspension forces...|$|R

It {{was found that}} under a positive gradient <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> the mean undercooling of pure Sb melts increased with increasing <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> intensity. However, under a negative gradient <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> the mean undercooling showed a decreasing tendency following an initial increase with increasing <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> intensity.

40|$|Within the {{confined}} isospin- and density-dependent mass model, {{we study}} {{the properties of}} strange quark matter (SQM) and quark stars (QSs) under strong <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> The equation of state of SQM under a constant <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is obtained self-consistently and the pressure perpendicular to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is shown to be larger than that parallel to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> implying that the properties of magnetized QSs generally depend on both the strength and {{the orientation of the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> distributed inside the stars. Using a density-dependent <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> profile which is introduced to mimic the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> strength distribution in a star, we study the properties of static spherical QSs by assuming two extreme cases for the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> orientation in the stars, i. e., the radial orientation in which the local <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> are along the radial direction and the transverse orientation in which the local <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> are randomly oriented but perpendicular to the radial direction. Our results indicate that including the <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> with radial (transverse) orientation can significantly decrease (increase) the maximum mass of QSs, demonstrating the importance of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> orientation inside the magnetized compact stars.
