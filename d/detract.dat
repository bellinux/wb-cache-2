5|$|Classic {{learning}} {{theories and}} the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction of interesting, tangential details to learning content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not <b>detract</b> from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.|$|E
5|$|In late 1994, the Croatian Army intervened {{several times}} in Bosnia: from November 1–3, in Operation Cincar near Kupres, and on November 29 – December 24 in the Winter '94 {{operation}} near Dinara and Livno. These operations were undertaken to <b>detract</b> from the siege of the Bihać region and to approach the RSK capital of Knin from the north, isolating it on three sides.|$|E

5|$|The DVD release {{included}} a behind-the-scenes featurette, film audio commentary from Mendes and Ball, and a storyboard presentation with discussion from Mendes and Hall. In the film commentary, Mendes refers to deleted scenes {{he intended to}} include in the release. However, these scenes are not on the DVD, as he changed his mind after recording the commentary; Mendes felt that to show scenes he previously chose not to use would <b>detract</b> from the film's integrity.|$|E
5|$|Although Kwee was {{a staunch}} {{supporter}} of realism in literature, Drama dari Krakatau includes {{a degree of}} mysticism, {{as evidenced by the}} apparent connection between the statue in the cave and the eruption of Krakatoa. Indeed, in many of his writings (both fiction and non-fiction), Kwee exhibited an interest in the occult; this includes writing detailed depictions of Therese Neumann, a fasting girl from Germany; and Omar Khayyám, a Persian Sufi mystic, philosopher and poet. The Indonesian literary critic Jakob Sumardjo finds the mystical elements (and the fact that no Hindu-era statues with inscriptions have been found) <b>detract</b> from the overall value of the novel.|$|E
5|$|In the thelytokous ant Platythyrea punctata, colonies are clonal; therefore, {{workers are}} all equally related genetically, and worker {{policing}} {{is not expected}} {{as there is no}} genetic conflict. However, one would expect severe effects on the condition of the colony if reproductive workers were left unchecked. For example, more time spent on individual reproduction would be predicted to <b>detract</b> from care of the queen's offspring. In studies of these ants, workers did actually display worker policing, as evidenced by increased aggression towards reproductive workers. Worker policing here is favored for group efficiency.|$|E

5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or <b>detract</b> from this effect.|$|E
5|$|A {{free agent}} in March 2001, Henderson {{returned}} to the Padres. During the 2001 season, he broke three major league career records and reached an additional major career milestone. He broke Babe Ruth's record of 2,062 career walks, Ty Cobb's record of 2,245 career runs, and Zack Wheat's record of 2,328 career games in left field, and {{on the final day}} of the season collected his 3,000th career hit, a leadoff double off Rockies pitcher John Thomson. That final game was also Padre Tony Gwynn's last major league game, and Henderson had originally wanted to sit out so as not to <b>detract</b> from the occasion, but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play. After scoring the game's first run, Henderson was removed from the lineup. With Gwynn having 3,141 hits, it was just the second time in Major League history that a pair of teammates each had 3,000 career hits; Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker had previously played many games together for the 1928 A's.|$|E

5|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} material is one which changes shape when {{a magnetic field}} is applied. In reverse, it produces a magnetic field when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the {{magnetostrictive material}}. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would <b>detract</b> from the generality of the filter design.|$|E
5|$|Back in Salisbury, the Southern Rhodesian {{government}} was coming {{under pressure from}} Britain to put its armed forces under the purview of a regional command. Huggins decided in late October 1942 to join a unified Southern African Command headed by South Africa's Jan Smuts. This choice was motivated {{by a combination of}} strategic concerns and geopolitical manoeuvring. Apart from considering South Africa a more appropriate partner in geographical, logistical and cultural terms, Huggins feared that the alternative—joining the British East Africa Command—might <b>detract</b> from the autonomous nature of Southern Rhodesia's war effort, with possible constitutional implications. A shift in the deployment of the colony's troops duly occurred. For the rest of the war the majority of Rhodesian servicemen went into the field integrated into South African formations, prominently the 6th Armoured Division.|$|E
5|$|Because of Southern Rhodesia's {{small size}} {{and lack of}} major controversies, its unicameral {{parliament}} then sat only twice a year, for about three months in total, holding discussions in the afternoons {{either side of a}} half-hour break for tea on the lawn. Smith's early parliamentary commitments in Salisbury therefore did not <b>detract</b> greatly from his ranching. His maiden speech to the Legislative Assembly, in November 1948, concerned the Union of South Africa Trade Agreement Bill, then at its second reading. He was slow to make an impact in parliament—most of his early contributions related to farming and mining—but his exertions within the party won him Stockil's respect and confidence. Janet ran Gwenoro during Smith's absences, and gave birth to his only biological child, Alec, in Gwelo on 20 May 1949.|$|E

5|$|Diệm's {{denial of}} {{governmental}} {{responsibility for the}} incident, and instead blaming members of the Viet Cong insurgency, led to growing discontent among the Buddhist majority. The incident spurred a protest movement by Buddhists against the religious discrimination of Diệm's Roman Catholic-dominated regime. The dispute {{came to be known}} as the Buddhist crisis, and it provoked widespread and large-scale civil disobedience throughout South Vietnam, persisting throughout May. The objective of the protests was to have Decree Number 10 repealed, and to force the implementation of religious equality. At the time, the United States, the main backer of South Vietnam in the Cold War, had 16,000 military advisers in the country to assist the Army of the Republic of Vietnam in the war against the Vietcong insurgency, which sought to reunify Vietnam under communist rule. Washington wanted the dispute with the Buddhists to be resolved quickly so that it would not dampen public morale and <b>detract</b> from the fight against the Vietcong.|$|E
5|$|Lindqvist {{had insisted}} on writing the {{screenplay}} himself. Alfredson, who had no familiarity with the vampire and horror genres, initially expressed skepticism at having the original author do the adaptation, but found the end result very satisfying. Many of the minor characters and events from the book were removed, and focus directed primarily on the love story between the two leads. In particular, {{many aspects of the}} character Håkan, including him being a paedophile, were toned down, and his relationship with Eli was mostly left open to interpretation. Alfredson felt that the film could not deal with such a serious theme as pedophilia in a satisfying manner, and that this element would <b>detract</b> from the story of the children and their relationship. Still, the film provided a few hints, of which Alfredson mentions one in the director's comments (Håkan likes children, for the wrong reasons).|$|E
5|$|One of Fox's {{earliest}} supporters was Isadore Sharp, {{founder of}} the Four Seasons Hotels. Sharp had lost his own son to cancer and offered Fox and his companions free accommodation at his hotels. He donated $10,000 and challenged 999 other businesses to do the same. Sharp also proposed an annual fundraising run in Fox's name. Fox agreed, but insisted that the runs be non-competitive. There were to be no winners or losers, and anyone who participated could run, walk or ride. Sharp faced opposition to the project. The Cancer Society feared that a fall run would <b>detract</b> from its traditional April campaigns, while other charities believed that an additional fundraiser would leave less money for their causes. Sharp persisted, and he, the Four Seasons Hotels and the Fox family organized the first Terry Fox Run on September 13, 1981.|$|E

5|$|Variety and realism were focuses for the tracks: they {{featured}} visuals such as forests, Neon Cities, and Canyons, {{complete with}} obstacles. The team travelled {{to photograph the}} textures. The tracks were constructed in Softimage 3D and converted to PlayStation format mesh data using a custom tool. In response to a common criticism of the original Destruction Derby, the tracks were designed to be larger and less narrow. The team were inspired by Daytonas revolving windmills, and large jumps were implemented to add drama to the tracks. The most realistic aspect of the race tracks was the pit stop, although Edmondson stated that he limited players to one stop because the team {{did not want to}} <b>detract</b> from the action and because a penalty system would have added a lot of extra work. Cars nearing destruction were designed to behave in a realistic and unpredicatable fashion through effects such as losing the bonnet (hood) and catching on fire.|$|E
5|$|A {{road from}} Julian to Kane Springs was {{completed}} in 1925. Efforts to include this road extending to Brawley into the state highway system date back from 1927, {{in order to receive}} state funding for the road. Plans for a cross-country road through Borrego Springs were being discussed by county government officials in 1927, as there were no east–west state highways in between Mountain Springs and Riverside. Those living in Calipatria and Westmorland supported the prospect of the road to Julian being improved, and included in the state highway system. In 1928, state assembly member Myron Witter {{wrote a letter to the}} San Diego County Board of Supervisors to suggest that the highway be incorporated as a second entrance to the county from the east, and that it would not <b>detract</b> from the progress of the other highway from El Centro; however, the county wanted to prioritize the paving over the designation. Chambers of commerce in the Imperial Valley generally agreed with Witter, proposing that the El Centro–Calexico road be made a part of the state highway system, and the Kane Springs–Julian road be given second priority for inclusion.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the episode}} was filmed on the Daedalus set. Due to that, visual effects were {{required}} {{to fill in the}} external shots. The episode was reportedly {{one of the most expensive}} VFX budgets in the series, and is the most expensive for the season. The star map behind the captain's chair of the Daedalus is usually lit green. However, the episode's writer and supervising producer, Alan McCullough, deliberately turned the map 90 degrees and changed the color from green to orange, so as to make the ship different from the normal Daedalus. McCullough also stated that the episode is a one-off, but did not rule out a return beyond the fifth season. He also said that he originally planned the team to visit a reality where the Ancients won the war against the Wraith, but this idea was dropped as it would <b>detract</b> from the main storyline. The episode was Jason Momoa's first appearance with his customised wig. After he had his hair cut by the time the fourth season was completed, for the first three episodes he had it sewn back on. However, when SCI FI wouldn't allow his hairstyle to be changed, they switched to the wig after Momoa complained about the pain of having his hair sewn on again.|$|E
