Only the emergency care factors were associated with differences in outcome. Both the period from collapse until initiation of basic life support and the duration of basic life support before delivery of the first defibrillatory shock were shorter in patients who survived compared with those who died (3. 6 ± 2. 5 versus 6. 1 ± 3. 3 minutes and 4. 3 ± 3. 3 versus 7. 3 ± 4. 2 minutes; p < 0. 05). A linear regression model based on emergency response times for 942 patients discovered in ventricular fibrillation was used to estimate <b>expected</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> if the first-responding rescuers, in addition to paramedics, had been equipped and trained to defibrillate. <b>Expected</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> were higher with early defibrillation (38 ± 3 %; 95 % confidence limits) than the observed rate (28 ± 3 %).

Memory cells are also utilized to preserve better feasible solutions after selection so as to restrain continuous generation of similar feasible ones and ensure that the algorithm can continue to search the global optimal solution.

40|$|Introduction: Annually in Canada, {{endometrial cancer}} affects {{approximately}} 4500 women and 790 {{are expected to}} die of their disease. To better understand survival trends across the country we undertook this population based study of Canadian women diagnosed with endometrial cancer. Long term trends in relative survival were evaluated by age and geographic region of residence. Methods: Women with an ICD- 10 code of C 54 and endometrial cancer were identified from the Canadian Cancer Registry. They were included if the incident diagnosis occurred between 1992 and 2005, and they were 16 years and older at diagnosis. A flexible parametric model {{was used to determine}} relative survival ratio (i. e., the observed survival rate among cancer patients divided by the <b>expected</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rate</b> in the general population). Results: 18, 486 women were diagnosed with endometrial cancer. Mean age was 63. 4 (SD= 11. 8) year. Relative survival decreased with each successive age group cohort of patient (16 - 49 yr compared to over 60 years, p< 0. 001). When relative survival was adjusted for age, women in British Columbia had the best outcomes (eastern Canada compared to other jurisdictions p< 0. 001). Five-year survival outcomes improved for each age group cohort during the 1992 to 2005 time frame. Conclusions: Regional variations in relative survival were identified across Canada for women with endometrial cancer. This suggests that other factors related to the patient or processes of care are involved. Examining these factors in further detail may provide opportunities to improve the care of women with endometrial cancer in Canada...|$|E

40|$|Planet-planet {{scattering}} is {{the leading}} mechanism to explain the large eccentricities of the observed exoplanet population. However, scattering has not been considered important {{to the production of}} pairs of planets in mean motion resonances (MMRs). We present results from a large number of numerical simulations of dynamical instabilities in 3 -planet systems. We show that MMRs arise naturally in about five percent of cases. The most common resonances we populate are the 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 MMRs, although a wide variety of MMRs can occur, including high-order MMRs (up to eleventh order). MMRs are generated preferentially in systems with uneven mass distributions: the smallest planet is typically ejected after a series of close encounters, leaving the remaining, more massive planets in resonance. The distribution of resonant planets is consistent with the phase-space density of resonant orbits, meaning that planets are randomly thrown into MMRs rather than being slowly pulled into them. It may be possible to distinguish between MMRs created by scattering vs. convergent migration in a gaseous disk by considering planetary mass ratios: resonant pairs of planets beyond ~ 1 AU with more massive outer planets are likely to have formed by scattering. In addition, scattering may be responsible for pairs of planets in high-order MMRs (3 : 1 and higher) that are not easily populated by migration. The frequency of MMRs from scattering is comparable to the <b>expected</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rate</b> of MMRs in turbulent disks. Thus, planet-planet scattering {{is likely to be a}} major contributor to the population of resonant planets. Comment: 14 pages, accepted to ApJ Letter...|$|E

We did not assess the incidence of subsequent non-primary cancers in our patient population or how this incidence affects the patients' follow-up care and survival. Conclusions: Patients with stage I+II localised prostate gland carcinoma have improved survival compared with the normal male population. This finding cannot be explained solely by the administration of prostate carcinoma treatments, suggesting that men who participate in PSA screening may have better overall health behaviors and care than men who do not participate in screening. Future research should examine how treatment choice, especially an &# 8220;active surveillance&# 8221; approach to care, affects survival in these patients more than ten years after diagnosis. </p...|$|E
40|$|In mammals, {{parathyroid}} hormone (PTH) {{is a key}} regulator of extracellular calcium and inorganic phosphorus homeostasis. Although the parathyroid glands {{were thought to be}} the only source of PTH, extra-parathyroid PTH production in the thymus, which shares a common origin with parathyroids during organogenesis, has been proposed to provide an auxiliary source of PTH, resulting in a higher than <b>expected</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rate</b> for aparathyroid Gcm 2 ⁻/⁻ mutants. However, the developmental ontogeny and cellular identity of these "thymic" PTH-expressing cells is unknown. We found that the lethality of aparathyroid Gcm 2 ⁻/⁻ mutants was affected by genetic background without relation to serum PTH levels, suggesting a need to reconsider the physiological function of thymic PTH. We identified two sources of extra-parathyroid PTH in wild-type mice. Incomplete separation of the parathyroid and thymus organs during organogenesis resulted in misplaced, isolated parathyroid cells that were often attached to the thymus; this was the major source of thymic PTH in normal mice. Analysis of thymus and parathyroid organogenesis in human embryos showed a broadly similar result, indicating that these results may provide insight into human parathyroid development. In addition, medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) express PTH in a Gcm 2 -independent manner that requires TEC differentiation and is consistent with expression as a self-antigen for negative selection. Genetic or surgical removal of the thymus indicated that thymus-derived PTH in Gcm 2 ⁻/⁻ mutants did not provide auxiliary endocrine function. Our data show conclusively that the thymus does not serve as an auxiliary source of either serum PTH or parathyroid function. We further show that the normal process of parathyroid organogenesis in both mice and humans leads to the generation of multiple small parathyroid clusters in addition to the main parathyroid glands, that are the likely source of physiologically relevant "thymic PTH. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Breast cancer {{among women}} is a {{relatively}} common with a more favorable <b>expected</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> than other forms of cancers. This study aimed to determine the improved {{quality of life for}} post-mastectomy women through peer education. Methods Using pre and post test follow up and control design approach, 99 women with stage I and II of breast cancer diagnosis were followed one year after modified radical mastectomy. To measure the quality of life an instrument designed by the European organization for research and treatment of cancer, known as the Quality of Life Question (QLQ- 30) and it's breast cancer supplementary measure (QLQ-BR 23) at three points in time (before, immediately and two months after intervention) for both groups were used. The participant selection was a convenient sampling method and women were randomly assigned into two experimental and control groups. The experimental group was randomly assigned to five groups and peer educators conducted weekly educational programs for one month. Tabulated data were analyzed using chi square, t test, and repeated measurement multivariate to compare the quality of life differences over time. Results For the experimental group, the results showed statistically significant improvement in all performance aspects of life quality and symptom reduction (P Conclusion The findings {{of this study suggest that}} peer led education is a useful intervention for post-mastectomy women to improves their quality of life. </p...|$|R
40|$|Epithelial {{ovarian cancer}} {{continues}} to be the leadingcause of death from a gynaecologic malignancy in Canada and the developed world. In 2008, an estimated 2500 Canadian women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and approximately 1700 died from their disease, still a very sobering and unfortunate reality for the disease that often only “whispers. ” 1 While survival in early stage and particu-larly in low grade tumours approaches 90 %, the majority of women will present with advanced FIGO stage 3 or 4 dis-ease, will have manifested only vague abdominal symptoms, and can only <b>expect</b> a <b>survival</b> <b>rate</b> of approximately 15 % to 40 %. 2 Conventional screening modalities such as the ovarian can-cer tumour marker serum CA- 125 and trans-vaginal pelvic ultrasound have been disappointing, with studies demon-strating a less than optimal positive predictive value an...|$|R
40|$|Background: While {{the current}} liver {{allocation}} {{system based on}} MELD scores reduces waiting list mortality, it {{does not account for}} post-transplant outcome. Several donor assessment scores have been derived from national datasets to predict post-transplant outcome in order to assist transplant clinicians in matching the appropriate donor and recipient. Whether these tools accurately predict post-transplant outcome in a more specific patient cohort within a competitive environment is unknown. Methods: We calculated various donor assessment scores (the DRI, SOFT, and DMELD score) for each patient in a cohort of 414 patients that were transplanted between 1 - 1 - 2006 and 2 - 28 - 2011 at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Subsequently we compared the <b>expected</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> based on national datasets to the observed <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> in the selected cohort. Ultimately, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to compare survival between the different group classifications of each donor assessment score. Results: Recipients were predominantly males. The male to female ratio was 3 : 1 (mean age 55  10. 1 years; HCV 51. 2 %; HCC 37. 4 %). Recipients had an average calculated MELD score of 27. 1 ± 6. 1 at transplant. The average time spent on the waiting list was 1. 1 ± 3. 2 years. Donors were predominantly males. The mean donor age was 43. 4 ± 17. 9 years (Cause of death: CVA 44. 4 %; Anoxia 27. 1 %, and Trauma 26. 1 %). The DRI, SOFT, and DMELD were good predictors of post-transplant outcome. Survival analysis showed significant survival differences between the different SOFT groups; however, no significant survival differences were demonstrated in the DRI and DMELD groups. Conclusion: Donor assessment scores are excellent predictors of post-transplant outcome, even at an aggressive transplant center within a competitive organ procurement organization (OPO). However, to promote the use of donor assessment scores in predicting post-transplant outcome, the allocation system has to change fundamentally into a system that also accounts for post-transplant outcome. Eventually, this change will enable transplant clinicians to truly match donors and recipients. ...|$|R
