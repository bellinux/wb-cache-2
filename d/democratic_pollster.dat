500|$|After the announcement, Trump and Knauss {{had dinner}} with Ventura and were joined by actor Woody Harrelson. Ventura later commented that Trump's chances of success {{depended}} on his impression of the Reform Party. [...] Onlookers questioned Trump's motive in running. [...] <b>Democratic</b> <b>pollster</b> Harrison Hickman expressed doubts about the authenticity of Trump's campaign, saying [...] "It’s all marketing of his name." [...] Matt Bai of Newsweek commented [...] "Most serious-minded people think Trump's flirtation with the Reform Party's presidential nomination is just a publicity stunt." [...] Ex-wife Ivana Trump doubted he would actually run. [...] Former New York City Mayor Ed Koch commented that people would likely not flock to Trump's campaign, suggesting that Trump was merchandising his brand. Trump disagreed with the critics, arguing that even though his sales had increased {{as a result of}} media coverage, he was serious about the campaign. [...] Roger Stone was hired as director of the exploratory committee.|$|E
500|$|Biden's {{entry into}} the 1972 U.S. Senate {{election}} in Delaware presented a unique circumstance. Longtime Delaware political figure and Republican incumbent Senator J. Caleb Boggs was considering retirement, which would likely have left U.S. Representative Pete du Pont and Wilmington Mayor Harry G. Haskell Jr. in a divisive primary fight. To avoid that, U.S. President Richard M. Nixon helped convince Boggs to run again with full party support. [...] No other Democrat wanted to run against Boggs. Biden's campaign had virtually no money and was given no chance of winning. It was managed by his sister Valerie Biden Owens (who {{would go on to}} manage his future campaigns as well) and staffed by other members of his family, and relied upon handed-out newsprint position papers and meeting voters face-to-face; the small size of the state and lack of a major media market made the approach feasible. He did receive some assistance from the AFL-CIO and <b>Democratic</b> <b>pollster</b> Patrick Caddell. His campaign issues focused on withdrawal from Vietnam, the environment, civil rights, mass transit, more equitable taxation, health care, the public's dissatisfaction with politics-as-usual, and [...] "change". [...] During the summer, he trailed by almost 30percentage points, but his energy level, his attractive young family, and his ability to connect with voters' emotions gave the surging Biden an advantage over the ready-to-retire Boggs. He won the November 7, 1972, election in an upset by a margin of 3,162 votes.|$|E
2500|$|Political commentators, {{trying to}} explain how Reagan had won by such a large margin, coined the term [...] "Reagan Democrat" [...] to {{describe}} a Democratic voter who had voted for Reagan in 1980 and 1984 (as well as for George H.W. Bush in 1988), producing their landslide victories. They were mostly white, blue-collar and were attracted to Reagan's social conservatism {{on issues such as}} abortion and to his hawkish foreign policy. Stan Greenberg, a <b>Democratic</b> <b>pollster,</b> concluded that Reagan Democrats no longer saw Democrats as champions of their middle class aspirations, but instead saw it as being a party working primarily for the benefit of others, especially African Americans and social liberals.|$|E

50|$|Clinton had a {{very high}} name {{recognition}} of an estimated 99% (only 11% of all voters {{said they did not}} know enough about her to form an opinion) and according to <b>Democratic</b> <b>pollster</b> Celinda Lake, she has had strong support from African-Americans, and among college-educated women and single women.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, Ms. Magazine quoted {{longtime}} <b>Democratic</b> <b>pollster</b> Celinda Lake as saying, [...] "Corruption {{was a top}} {{issue in}} the 2006 midterm elections, and CREW was critical to the Democrats' success. The {{fact that they were}} bipartisan and had created this dirty-dozen list of corrupt politicians really helped people process that these politicians were acting well outside the norm." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, some Democrats criticized Rasmussen's polling methodology. <b>Democratic</b> <b>pollster</b> Mark Mellman said Rasmussen Reports polls [...] "tend to {{be among}} the worst polls for Democrats." [...] Tom Jensen, a pollster for Democratic firm Public Policy Polling said: [...] "The way Rasmussen does polls is that he’s more likely to get high-energy voters. I think Rasmussen favors Republicans this year, but I don’t think he {{inherently}} favors Republicans.” ...|$|E
50|$|In April 2011, {{about three}} months before the cost of living protests began, Boaz Gaon, son of {{prominent}} Israeli businessman Benny Gaon, presented activists with a ten-point plan by <b>Democratic</b> <b>pollster</b> and political strategist Stan Greenberg to defeat the right-wing. It was recommended that not one organization should coordinate the struggle, rather to divide up the effort with as many initiatives in as many locations as possible. Maariv journalist Kalman Libeskind suggested that the protests were a result of this plan.|$|E
50|$|Stan Greenberg, a <b>Democratic</b> <b>pollster,</b> {{analyzed}} white ethnic voters - largely unionized {{auto workers}} - in suburban Macomb County, Michigan, {{just north of}} Detroit.

He concluded that Reagan Democrats no longer saw Democrats as champions of their middle class aspirations, but instead {{saw it as a}} party working primarily for the benefit of others, especially African Americans, advocacy groups of the political left, and the very poor.|$|E

Democrat Bill Clinton targeted the Reagan Democrats with considerable success in 1992 and 1996.|$|E

5000|$|No other Democrat {{wanted to}} run against Boggs besides Biden, a New Castle County Councilman. [...] Biden's {{campaign}} had virtually no money and was given no chance of winning. [...] It was managed by his sister Valerie Biden Owens (who {{would go on to}} manage his future campaigns as well) and staffed by other members of his family, and relied upon handed-out newsprint position papers.

5000|$|Republican pollster Ayres, McHenry and Associates {{found that}} 82 percent of {{registered}} voters believe that [...] "well-qualified" [...] nominees should receive an up or down vote (which would have included all of the candidates except Janice Rogers Brown). An Associated Press-Ipsos poll released May 20, 2005, found 78 percent of Americans believe the Senate should take an [...] "assertive role" [...] examining judicial nominees rather than just give the president {{the benefit of the}} doubt. <b>Democratic</b> <b>pollster</b> Westhill Partners found that only 30 percent of Americans approve changing [...] "the rules to require only 51 votes to end a filibuster - thereby eliminating the current system of checks and balances on the majority party." ...|$|E
5000|$|The work of <b>Democratic</b> <b>pollster</b> Stan Greenberg is {{a classic}} study of Reagan Democrats. Greenberg {{analyzed}} white ethnic voters (largely unionized auto workers) in Macomb County, Michigan, just north of Detroit. The county voted 63 percent for John F. Kennedy in 1960, but 66 percent for Reagan in 1984. He concluded that [...] "Reagan Democrats" [...] no longer saw the Democratic party as champions of their working class aspirations, but instead saw them as working primarily {{for the benefit of}} others: the very poor, feminists, the unemployed, African Americans, Latinos, and other groups. In addition, Reagan Democrats enjoyed gains during the period of economic prosperity that coincided with the Reagan administration following the [...] "malaise" [...] of the Carter administration. They also supported Reagan's strong stance on national security and opposed the 1980s Democratic Party on such issues as pornography, crime, and high taxes.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the general}} {{election}} campaign, Harris presented herself as a moderate Republican. The Las Vegas Review-Journal went further by calling her [...] "a Republican running on Democrat issues." [...] Jones' campaign {{was supported by the}} unions Culinary and AFL-CIO, that both provided volunteers. In September, Jones was attacked in a television ad about Jones' incident while representing Las Vegas Sands as an attorney. The Review-Journal called the ad misleading. Two polls were conducted, the first in late September by the Republican pollster The Tarrance Group, and the second in early October by <b>Democratic</b> <b>pollster</b> Momentum Analysis. The difference between the candidates was in both polls within the margin of error. According to the poll by The Tarrance Group, Harris would get 45% of the votes and Jones 42%. The Democratic poll said Jones would get more with 46% of the votes, while Harris would get 44%. On November 4, Harris defeated Jones with 55% of the votes, resulting in a Republican majority in the Senate.|$|E
