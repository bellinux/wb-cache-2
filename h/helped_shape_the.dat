5|$|After World War II, the 20 {{years of}} {{foundational}} {{work by the}} bomber mafia resulted in {{the separation of the}} United States Air Force from the Army to become an independent military arm. The bomber mafia's strategic doctrine, changed by war and experience, <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> <b>the</b> mission of the new Air Force and its Strategic Air Command.|$|E
5|$|Despite Reich's {{precarious}} mental health, {{his work}} on character {{and the idea of}} muscular armouring contributed to the development of what is now known as ego psychology, gave rise to body psychotherapy, and <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> <b>the</b> Gestalt therapy of Fritz Perls, the bioenergetic analysis of Reich's student Alexander Lowen, and the primal therapy of Arthur Janov.|$|E
5|$|Moorfields {{remained}} largely open until 1812, and the longstanding presence of that open space separating the emerging East End {{from the western}} urban expansion of London must have <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> <b>the</b> varying economic character of the two parts and perceptions of their distinct identity (see map below).|$|E

The orbits {{of most of}} the system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's equatorial plane (Mercury is the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital tilt), the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner Solar System's history.|$|E
5|$|The king soon revoked the {{charters}} {{of freedom}} and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued {{in other parts of}} the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at Billericay, he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt. Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> <b>the</b> absolutist attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} reforms <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> <b>the</b> cavalry's {{contribution to}} the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which was established with one cavalry division supported by two brigades of horse artillery. All would be trained for the mounted charge but would also be armed with rifles, the only major power to do so. The cavalry regiments were armed with Maxim Machine Guns, although these were replaced by Vickers Machine Guns from 1912. More than anything else, the issue of entrenching tools that were carried on the troop packhorses demonstrated how much the cavalry's doctrine had changed since the Boer Wars.|$|E

5|$|The {{route is}} officially {{known as the}} Jacob Dekema Freeway after Jacob Dekema, a {{pioneering}} force from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) who <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> <b>the</b> San Diego freeway system. It {{is also part of}} the California Freeway and Expressway System and the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. In 2013, I-805 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 41,500 at the southern terminus, and 262,000 between Bonita Road and SR 54, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.|$|E
5|$|Adi Shankaracharya (788–820) chose Sringeri in Karnataka to {{establish}} {{the first of his}} four mathas (monastery). Madhvacharya (1238–1317) was the chief proponent of Tattvavada (Philosophy of Reality), popularly known as Dvaita or Dualistic school of Hindu philosophy— one of the three most influential Vedanta philosophies. Madhvacharya was one of the important philosophers during the Bhakti movement. He was a pioneer in many ways, going against standard conventions and norms. According to tradition, Madhvacharya {{is believed to be the}} third incarnation of Vayu (Mukhyaprana), after Hanuman and Bhima. The Haridasa devotional movement is considered as one of the turning points in the cultural history of India. Over a span of nearly six centuries, several saints and mystics <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> <b>the</b> culture, philosophy and art of South India and Karnataka in particular by exerting considerable spiritual influence over the masses and kingdoms that ruled South India.|$|E
5|$|Because of this {{beginning}} of the incursion of Europeans into the area, {{the members of the}} Confederacy <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> <b>the</b> development of North America throughout the 18th century, becoming a centre of trade and culture. Great Britain supported this strengthening of the tribes in the area as a set of allies against the French and the Iroqouis. The people of the Three Fires Confederacy, however, sided with the French during the Seven Years' War and only made peace with Great Britain after the Treaty of Fort Niagara in 1764. It also fought {{on the side of the}} British during the War of 1812. The Three Fires Confederacy also broke several treaties with the United States prior to 1815, but finally signed the Treaty of Springwells in September of that year and ceased all hostilities directed at the United States. The Grand Council survived intact until the middle to late 19th century, when more modern political systems began to evolve.|$|E

5|$|Design of the PanzerI {{began in}} 1932 and mass {{production}} began in 1934. Intended {{only as a}} training tank to introduce the concept of armored warfare to the German Army, the PanzerI saw combat in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, in Poland, France, the Soviet Union and North Africa during the Second World War, and in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Experiences with the PanzerI during the Spanish Civil War <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> <b>the</b> German Panzerwaffes' invasion of Poland in 1939 and France in 1940. By 1941, the PanzerI chassis design {{was used as the}} basis of tank destroyers and assault guns. There were attempts to upgrade the PanzerI throughout its service history, including by foreign nations, to extend the design's lifespan. It continued to serve in the Spanish Armed Forces until 1954.|$|E
5|$|Though {{inhabited}} {{prior to}} the 16th century, {{little is known about}} Barbadian music before the arrival of the Portuguese in 1536 and then the English in 1627. The Portuguese left little influence, but English culture and music <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> <b>the</b> island's heritage. Irish and Scottish settlers emigrated in the 17th century, working in the tobacco industry, bringing still more new music to the island. The middle of the 17th century saw the decline of the tobacco industry and the rise of sugarcane, as well as the introduction of large numbers of African slaves. Brazilian exiles however, along with sugarcane introduced Samba to the island which featured a mixture of Latin music with African influences which soon developed into Soca-Samba which is indigenous to Barbados. Modern Barbadian music is thus largely a combination of English and African elements, with Irish, Scottish, and modern American and Caribbean (especially Jamaican) influences as well.|$|E
5|$|When Strabo was {{assigned}} to the governorship of Egypt in AD 15, Sejanus became the sole commander of the Praetorians and instigated reforms that <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> <b>the</b> guard into a powerful tool of the principate. In AD 20 the scattered encampments inside the city were centralized into a single garrison just outside Rome and the number of cohorts was increased from nine to twelve, one of which now held the daily guard at the palace. The practice of joint leadership between two prefects was abandoned, and Sejanus himself appointed the centurions and tribunes. With these changes in effect, Sejanus now commanded the complete loyalty of a force of around 12,000 soldiers, all of which were at his immediate disposal. The facade of Augustus was no longer maintained, and Tiberius openly displayed the strength of the guard at parades.|$|E

5|$|Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's {{relations}} with the group of composers known as the Belyayev circle, which lasted from 1887 until Tchaikovsky's death in 1893, influenced all of their music and briefly <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> <b>the</b> next generation of Russian composers. This group was named after timber merchant Mitrofan Belyayev, an amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher after he had taken an interest in Alexander Glazunov's work. By 1887, Tchaikovsky was firmly established {{as one of the}} leading composers in Russia. A favorite of Tsar Alexander III, he was widely regarded as a national treasure. He was in demand as a guest conductor in Russia and Western Europe, and in 1890 visited the United States in the same capacity. By contrast, the fortunes of the nationalistic group of composers known as The Five, which preceded the Belyayev circle, had waned, and the group had long since dispersed; of its members, only Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov remained fully active as a composer. Now a professor of musical composition and orchestration at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, Rimsky-Korsakov had become a firm believer in the Western-based compositional training that had been once frowned upon by the group.|$|E
