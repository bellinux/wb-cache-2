40|$|The Use of Anti-Foam Polypropylene Glycol for The Evaporation of Liquid Radioactive Waste That Contains Detergent]Radiation {{work clothes}} washing {{operation}} in Radioactive Waste Treatment Plant Batan, Puspiptek, Serpong raises 133, 7 m 3 of liquid waste containing detergent concentration of 1, 496 g/l, {{the activity of}} at least 10 - 6 Ci/m 3, and the main radioactive elements in the waste is Cs- 137. Afterward, the waste mixed with other similar liquid waste from reactors and fabrication facilities radioisotopes, then processed through evaporation. When evaporation was running, emergence of foam can cause carry-over that led to distillate contaminated. In order to prevent foam that may cause carry-over, it 2 ̆ 7 s needed anti-foam to defuse foam. Anti-foam material {{that can be used}} in the process of evaporation of liquid radioactive waste containing detergents are silicone oil and polyethylene glycol [1, 3]. Anti-foam material other than silicon oil and polyethylene glycol is polypropylene glycol [2, 3]. Polypropylene glycol is more viscous than the silicone oil and polyethylene glycol so that tend to insoluble which means polypropylene glycol more effective to reduce the amount of foam as polypropylene glycol layer formed on the surface of the foam does not support liquid foam, better than the silicone oil and polyethylene glycol [4]. Ethylene glycol was considerably toxic compared propylene glycol. Moreover, propylene glycol is an anti-foam compounds are safe and environmentally friendly as well as a renewable products derived from bio-glycerol derivative [5]. This study uses simulated waste with Cs- 137 activity 14, 8 Bq / ml, the content of dry extract 5 g / l, and the variation of the detergent concentration 0, 1247 g/l; 0, 1496 g/l; 0, 187 g/l; 0, 374 g/l; 0, 748 g/l; dan 1, 496 g/l. The results of this study is the use of anti-foam in the process of evaporation on the detergent concentration 0, 1247 g / l to 0, 187 g / l, very effective, because the distillate activity without the use of anti-foam and anti-foam provides a significant difference. The use of anti-foam in the process of evaporation on the detergent concentration 0, 374 g / l to 1, 496 g / l does not provide a significant difference. In the detergent concentration more than 1, 496 g / l of liquid surface can not be controlled with anti-foam.

Although generally well tolerated, serious neurological events have been reported. The composition and {{properties of the}} foam, including bubble size and gaseous components, {{may contribute to the}} potential for microcirculatory obstruction and cerebral ischemia. We tested an ultra-low nitrogen polidocanol endovenous microfoam with controlled bubble size and density and hypothesized that patients at risk due to the presence of middle cerebral artery (MCA) bubble emboli during microfoam injection would not demonstrate evidence of clinical or subclinical cerebral infarction. MethodsPatients with great saphenous vein incompetence were treated with ultra-low nitrogen (≤ 0. 8 %) polidocanol endovenous microfoam injected under ultrasound guidance. Patients with right-to-left shunt were included to evaluate the safety of cerebral arterial bubbles. All patients with MCA emboli detected by transcranial Doppler during endovenous microfoam ablation received intensive surveillance for microinfarction, including brain magnetic resonance imaging and measurement of cardiac troponin-I. ResultsMCA bubble emboli were detected in 60 of 82 treated patients; 22 patients had no detectable emboli. Among patients with MCA bubbles detected, 49 (82 %) had ≤ 15 bubbles. No patients developed magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities, neurological signs, or elevated cardiac troponin. ConclusionsPatients treated with foamed liquid sclerosants are commonly exposed to cerebrovascular gas bubbles. In this series of 60 high-risk patients with MCA bubble emboli during or after treatment with ultra-low nitrogen polidocanol endovenous microfoam, {{there was no evidence of}} cerebral or cardiac microinfarction.

It was also observed that the foaming agent concentration affected all the mechanical parameters. When the content of foaming agent was increased, the number of foams was increased leading to a decrease in density of the compounds. But the size and distribution of foams remained unchanged with increased foaming agent. The effect of high styrene-butadiene rubber (HSBR) was also studied.

Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) are used to study the presence of additives in polymers {{that are used in}} living systems. Representative samples are used to illustrate and develop the extraction capability of the system with extracts being analysed both by on-line and off-line SFC, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and gravimetrically. Different types of additives are employed illustrating their chromatographic behaviour and the uses of both flame ionisation (FID) and UV /Visible detection. The qualitative aspects of the analysis of polymer additives are augmented by on-line linking of a mass spectrometer (MS) to the SFC. The spectra obtained from this system are compared with other probe-MS, GC-MS and library spectra that are available to establish the quality of the spectra obtained. The development of on-line SFE-SFC-MS for the analysis of polymer additives allows for a quick qualitative analysis of the compounds present in polymer samples. Using a set of flame retardants, which are difficult to analyse by comparable methods, on-line SFE-SFC quantitative investigations are performed on polyurethane <b>foams</b> containing these <b>compounds</b> using short extraction times and varying pressures.

40|$|Microporous {{syntactic}} metal <b>foams</b> {{based on}} <b>compounds</b> of metal matrices and integrated micro glass bubbles present {{a group of}} materials with interesting properties. They demonstrate outstanding specific compression strengths, very high specific compression energy absorption capability, are tight against infiltration by fluids even at higher pressures and can be coated using techniques which are more common for compact materials like anodizing, copper- and chromium-plating. Corrosion properties of aluminium and zinc syntactic foams were tested by electrochemical potential measurements, immersion tests and long-time out-door exposure and determined {{to be close to}} those of compact alloys. Several approaches have been performed by IFAM for the production of these materials, e. g. by infiltration of sintered glass bubbles preforms with aluminium and zinc alloys using squeeze casting or gas-pressure infiltration of sintered preforms with aluminium. However, for alloys with higher melting temperatures liquid infiltration is not always possible. Therefore, tests have recently been carried out to examine the feasibility of the production of glass bubble syntactic foams with steel matrices by metal powder injection moulding (MIM). Blends of 58 vol% Fe 50 Ni 50 powder mixed in polymers and waxes (binder) and 2, 3, 5 and 7 wt% 3 M-S 38 glass bubbles were produced and injection moulded into test specimens. After moulding the binder was removed out of the samples and the metallic material was densified around the glass bubbles in a sintering step.

40|$|Fire {{presents}} a great risk to humans and their possessions. Polymeric compounds are highly flammable and compounds {{are added to}} increase their fire resistance. These additives {{are referred to as}} flame retardants. Intumescent flame retardants are systems that form a carbon rich foam {{on the surface of the}} polymer during thermal degradation. A new field of metal catalysed intumescence is discussed in this document. The influence of both the metal ion and organic backbone of polyhydroxylcarboxylic acid metal salts was studied. The intumescence and foaming properties of selected salts were studied in more detail. Gluconic acid proved to be the best intumescent and showed the best combination of carbon char yield, foam structure and volume, stability and open flame characteristics. As a general rule of thumb, the char volume and structure improved with an increased number of hydroxyl groups in the compound. Carbon char yield increased with an increase in the number of hydroxyl groups for a constant number of carbons in the complex. The number of acid groups in the compound played a lesser role in intumescence. Most metal complexes catalyse intumescent decomposition of polyhydric compounds such as polyhydroxylcarboxylic acids and pentaerythritol. The reduction in the volatilisation losses implies that the metal cations catalyse carbonisation reactions in the polyhydroxyl compound. Unfortunately, the resultant carbon-foams are unstable: the metal residues also catalyse the further oxidative degradation of the char. The low thermal stability of the compositions tested, as well as the afterglow effect makes them unsuitable for use as flame retardant additives in plastics. From the studies of the different metal complexes with acetylacetone and gluconic acid, it was concluded that the calcium ion exhibited the most promise. When pyrolysed in air with an open gas flame or in a furnace, calcium gluconate monohydrate produces voluminous foam. The foam is of a closed cell structure, densely packed and has no mechanical strength. The cell walls are very thin (5 to 50 nm) and the cells are between 50 µm and 200 µm in size. If the sample is compressed before heating, the resultant foam produced during pyrolysis is less voluminous than that of the loose powder. The BET surface area of the calcium gluconate monohydrate foamed at 300 °C for 5 min. is 16. 0 m 2 /g. The foam produced after 5 min heating at 300 °C has a thermal conductivity similar to standard polystyrene foam. Adding leached silica to the calcium gluconate monohydrate increases mechanical strength of the foam, but influences the foam volume negatively. The optimum silica level was calculated to be 1 : 1 gluconate to silica on a mole ratio (11. 8 % SiO 2 by mass). The mechanical strength of the foam can also be increased with the addition of expandable graphite. The graphite has a lesser influence on the foam volume than the silica, but also reduces the foam volume. However, the addition of the expandable graphite gives the sample more. opening. force, as the foam volume of a compressed sample pyrolysed, is similar to that of the heated loose powder. Calcium gluconate monohydrate starts to degrade at 120 °C, losing its crystal water and shows a mass loss of 4 % at 180 °C. The exothermic peak (shown in the DSC/TGA data) associated with the metal catalysed carbon oxidation (afterglow) is observed at 570 °C in air. For the calcium gluconate monohydrate the transition from CaCO 3 to CaO occurs above 650 °C in air. It has been shown that the foaming of polyhydroxylcarboxylic acids is due to the formation of water vapour during degradation. For calcium gluconate monohydrate, foaming starts due to the loss of crystal water and is continued by the loss of hydroxyl groups as water. The bulk of the foaming is due to the second reaction. It has been shown that compounds with crystal waters produce a more voluminous and lower density foam. The foam is an amorphous carbon rich residue. The molecular mass of the carbon residue increases up to a heating temperature of 300 °C. This implies that the carbon residue crosslinks during formation, forming a stretchable cell wall for the <b>foam.</b> <b>Compounds</b> with a. free. hydroxyl group at the end of the carbon chain produce a foam of larger volume and lower density. This supports the crosslinking theory. The foam produced when calcium gluconate monohydrate is heated for 5 min at 300 °C in air is of very low density. 2. 5 kg/m 3 based on residual mass. The density of the calcium gluconate monohydrate pyrolysed at 1000 °C for 5 min in air yields a CaO with a density of 20 kg/m 3. This implies that the high temperature pyrolysis of calcium gluconate can produce an inorganic oxide of low bulk density and possible high specific surface area. The BET surface area of CaCO 3 from the gluconate pyrolysed at 600 °C is ~ 12 m 2 /g. An intumescent coating containing calcium gluconate monohydrate, leached silica and expandable graphite as a system was prepared and compared to commercial formulations. This gluconate based system was at least as efficient as the commercial formulations when painted on balsa wood planks or aluminium plates. On cardboard sheets it did not perform as well as the commercial systems. More work should be done to overcome the afterglow effect observed with metal- based intumescent systems. The crystal structure of calcium gluconate monohydrate should be determined as to understand the decomposition better. It is unclear whether the decomposition is catalysed inter- or intramolecularly.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To compare foam bubble {{size and}} bubble size distribution, stability, and {{degradation}} rate (DR) of commercially available polidocanol endovenous microfoam (Varithena®) and physician <b>compounded</b> <b>foams</b> (PCFs) using {{a number of}} laboratory tests. METHODS Foam properties of polidocanol endovenous microfoam and PCFs were measured and compared using a glass plate method and a Sympatec QICPIC image analysis method to measure bubble size and bubble size distribution, Turbiscan™ LAB for foam half time and drainage, and a novel biomimetic vein model to measure foam stability. PCFs composed of polidocanol and room air (RA), CO 2, or mixtures of oxygen and carbon dioxide (O 2 :CO 2) were generated by different methods. RESULTS Polidocanol endovenous microfoam {{was found to have}} a narrow bubble size distribution with no large (> 500 ?m) bubbles. PCFs made with the Tessari method had broader bubble size distribution and large bubbles, which have an impact on foam stability. Polidocanol endovenous microfoam had a lower degradation rate (DR) than any PCFs, including foams made using RA (p< 0. 035). The same result was obtained at different liquid to gas ratios (1 : 4 and 1 : 7) for PCFs. In all tests performed, CO 2 foams were the least stable and different O 2 :CO 2 mixtures had intermediate performance. In the biomimetic vein model, polidocanol endovenous microfoam had the slowest DR, and longest calculated dwell time, which represents the length of time the foam is in contact with the vein, almost twice that of PCFs using RA and eight times better than PCFs prepared using equivalent gas mixes. CONCLUSION Bubble size, bubble size distribution, and stability of various sclerosing foam formulations show that polidocanol endovenous microfoam results in better overall performance compared with PCFs. Polidocanol endovenous microfoam offers better stability and cohesive properties in a biomimetic vein model compared to PCFs. Polidocanol endovenous microfoam, which is indicated in the United States for treatment of great saphenous vein system incompetence, provides clinicians with a consistent product with enhanced handling properties...|$|R
40|$|When I {{was growing}} up, {{both my parents}} worked at a U-Haul from which they brought home {{discarded}} objects to the house my dad built with his own hands. This home, interior and exterior, was not designed to fit an explicit aesthetic, but {{all aspects of the}} house were in harmony and completed by the objects brought into each space. The house became a repository for abandoned domestic American culture— beds, window blinds, couches, appliances, and other products made it into the home in irregular but frequent intervals. For me, each item was an opportunity to have something new to experience. The way I approach my work is never from a directly observed source. I convey my subjects strictly from memory, similar to my childhood musings with drawing. I take materials that are common for the construction of houses such as pink insulation <b>foam,</b> joint <b>compound,</b> latex paint, and spray paint. These materials gain a new identity as they are configured onto a wooden structure. The objects are re-contextualized through quirky sometimes bulbous, sometimes animated shapes, to allow them to transcend their original purpose. Through this, I foster a new narrative for each piece while maintaining the basic visual familiarity. I wish the transformation of material to create a visceral response to the objects being depicted such as the AC unit or garden hose. I want to solicit this response to items I find or know, manipulate or construct, and to create an environment through the relationship of these objects. The three-dimensional forms of my current work create conversation with my past work as a painter— most objects I make have a relationship with the wall against which they are placed or hung and others mimic the idea of oil paint’s materiality. Some forms resemble minimal sculpture, leading the viewer to re-investigate how we perceive the household item. The objects I make are depictions of items that were brought into my home or found in proximity around it. Each piece is derived from an association I have towards it such as the piece titled “No Wiggle Room, Again” in which I represent a bunk bed. When I was a child, my two younger siblings and I had to share the top bunk for years due to the limit of space we had growing up. The bed is hung high igniting a child’s perspective, and the structure of the bed is small dictating the space we had to share. Memories, dreams, and experience play a role in determining the importance of a piece. A created form could embody a portrait or simply act in a supporting role to the overall completion of an environment. All are grouped to create both an interior and exterior version of how I perceived the objects when I was a child. This exhibition is a suggestion of an environment. It began with memories from the house my dad built on Whitetail Lane in Lytton Springs, Texas. Each domestic form, changed through material and scale, builds its own reality within this space.

40|$|We have {{recently}} {{reported on the}} development of a biomimetic vein model to measure the performance of sclerosing foams. In this study we employed the model to compare the commercially-available Varithena(®) (polidocanol injectable foam) 1 % varicose vein treatment (referred to as polidocanol endovenous microfoam, or PEM) with physician <b>compounded</b> <b>foams</b> (PCFs) made using different foam generation methods (Double Syringe System and Tessari methods) and different foam formulations [liquid to gas ratios of 1 : 3 or 1 : 7; gas mixtures composed of 100 % CO 2, various CO 2 :O 2 mixtures and room air (RA) ]. PCFs produced using the DSS method had longer dwell times (DTs) (range 0. 54 - 2. 21 s/cm in the 4 mm diameter vein model) than those of the corresponding PCFs produced by the Tessari technique (range 0. 29 - 0. 94 s/cm). PEM had the longest DT indicating the best cohesive stability of any of the foams produced (2. 92 s/cm). Other biomimetic model variables investigated included effect of vessel size, delayed injection and rate of plug formation (injection speed). When comparing the 4 and 10 mm vessel diameters, the DTs seen in the 10 mm vessel were higher than those observed for the 4 mm vessel, as the vein angle had been reduced to 5 ° to allow for foam plug formation. PCF foam performance was in the order RA > CO 2 :O 2 (35 : 65) ? CO 2 :O 2 (65 : 35) > CO 2; PEM had a longer DT than all PCFs (22. 10 s/cm) except that for RA made by DSS which was similar but more variable. The effect of delayed injection was also investigated and the DT for PEM remained the longest of all foams with the lowest percentage deviation with respect to the mean values, indicating a consistent foam performance. When considering rate of plug formation, PEM consistently produced the longest DTs and this was possible even at low plug expansion rates (mean 29. 5 mm/s, minimum 20. 9 mm/s). The developed vein model has therefore demonstrated that PEM consistently displays higher foam stability and cohesiveness when compared to PCFs, over a range of clinically-relevant operational variables...|$|R
