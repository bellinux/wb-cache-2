5|$|Although Gordon was a {{tropical}} storm {{for most of its}} existence, it caused enormous damage and loss of life. The United Nations estimated death toll in Haiti was 1,122. Six deaths were reported in Costa Rica, five in the Dominican Republic, two in Jamaica, two in Cuba, and eight in Florida. Property damage to the United States was estimated at $400million (1994 USD, $ USD). Property damage statistics for the other affected areas are not available, but were reportedly severe in both Haiti and Cuba. The high <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> <b>from</b> Gordon made it the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane David in 1979, which killed thousands in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} brought {{widespread rain}} to West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh during its lifespan, with rains of 140mm (5.5inches) as far west as Lucknow. The rains in Uttar Pradesh caused severe property damage and flooding, with some 150people losing {{their lives in}} the state. The Ganges flooded in northern Bihar, inundating parts of Munger District, whilst the Gandaki River flooded parts of Motihari. The rains worsened floods in south Bengal, increasing the <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> <b>from</b> the floods there to 80 and affecting 8million people, with considerable damage done to crops and housing. Jaleswar in Orissa was entirely flooded.|$|E

25|$|In some areas, up to 20centimeters of {{rain fell}} in 24hours. More than 2,000 were rescued, {{according}} to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), and at least 20,000 people were staying in 10 evacuation centers in Cagayan de Oro. Officials were also investigating reports that an entire village was swept away. The confirmed <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> <b>from</b> the disaster is 1,268.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{extensive}} damage and high <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> <b>from</b> Felix in Nicaragua, {{the name was}} officially retired on May 13, 2008 by the World Meteorological Organization during its annual meeting in Orlando, Florida, and will never be used again for any future Atlantic hurricanes.

25|$|An {{outbreak}} of bird flu {{throughout the country}} has affected the numbers of foreign visitors. As of 2006, the outbreak had killed at least 46 people since 2005, making Indonesia {{the country with the}} highest <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> <b>from</b> the recent epidemic. However, since the disease has not yet been proven to mutate into a form that can transfer from human to human, the US embassy, for example, has not yet issued a travel warning regarding the outbreak.|$|E
25|$|The 1906 San Francisco {{earthquake}} {{struck the}} city (then {{the largest in}} California) and nearby communities at 5:12a.m. on Wednesday, April 18, 1906. Devastating fires {{broke out in the}} city that lasted for several days, destroying about 28,000 buildings. As a result of the quake and fires, over 3,000 people died and over 80% of San Francisco was destroyed. The <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> <b>from</b> the earthquake and resulting fire is the greatest loss of life from a natural disaster in California's history.|$|E
25|$|The high {{death rate}} {{because of poor}} medical facilities.This leads to a small natural {{increase}} of around 0.5%.Deaths due to HIV/AIDS have reduced due to improved methods of protection. However, outward migration rates of around 1.5% or more have been experienced for over a decade, therefore actual population changes are uncertain. Because of {{the high number of}} unaccounted emigrants, the recent increase of emigration and the <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> <b>from</b> AIDS, the total population might be declining to as low as 8 million according to some estimates.|$|E

5|$|The season's first {{storm had}} limited {{reported}} impacts on land, {{and the subsequent}} system caused more severe damage in southern Texas and northern Mexico. Hurricane Three dropped torrential rainfall on Puerto Rico before striking the same region as the previous cyclone. Hurricane Four bypassed Bermuda to the east, where some property damage was reported. Hurricane Five was the most catastrophic storm of the season, buffeting western Cuba {{for an extended period}} of time as it slowly executed a counterclockwise loop. <b>Death</b> <b>tolls</b> <b>from</b> the hurricane are estimated in the hundreds.|$|R
25|$|The United States has a {{very complex}} history with {{compulsory}} vaccination, particularly in enforcing compulsory vaccinations both domestically and abroad to protect American soldiers during times of war. There are {{hundreds of thousands of}} examples of soldier deaths that were not the result of combat wounds, but were instead from disease. Among wars with high <b>death</b> <b>tolls</b> <b>from</b> disease is the Civil War where an estimated 620,000 soldiers died from disease. American soldiers in other countries have spread diseases which ultimately disrupted entire societies and healthcare systems with famine and poverty.|$|R
25|$|The Associated Press {{reported}} {{that at a}} press conference on Monday, March 17, Tibet Autonomous Region governor Champa Phuntsok announced that 16 had been confirmed dead over the weekend's violence and dozens injured. Other sources published after the same press conference indicate that China put the death toll in Lhasa at 13. The Associated Press claimed later that the Chinese government's official <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> <b>from</b> the previous week's rioting in Lhasa had risen to 22. Accordingly, the death toll provided by Xinhua had risen to 19.|$|E
25|$|During the Russian {{annexation}} of Crimea from 23 February through 19 March 2014, six people were killed. The dead included: three protesters (two pro-Russian and one pro-Ukrainian), two soldiers and one Crimean SDF trooper. The two Ukrainian {{soldiers who were}} killed are regularly included in the military <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> <b>from</b> the War in Donbass. On 10 August 2016, Russia accused the Special Forces of Ukraine of conducting a raid near the Crimean town of Armyansk which killed two Russian servicemen. The government of Ukraine dismissed the report as a provocation.|$|E
25|$|Large {{numbers of}} {{civilians were killed}} or {{displaced}} in the Guatemalan military's counterinsurgency operations. To alienate the insurgents from their civilian base, the army carried out large-scale mass killing of unarmed civilians, burned villages and crops, and butchered animals, destroying survivors' means of livelihood. Sources with the human rights office of the Catholic Church estimated the <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> <b>from</b> the counterinsurgency in 1981 at 11,000, {{with most of the}} victims indigenous peasants of the Guatemalan highlands. Other sources and observers put the death toll due to government repression in 1981 at between 9,000 and 13,500.|$|E

40|$|Persistent institutions, {{which are}} {{captured}} by legal origin, {{are considered to}} influence the occurrence and intensity of economic crises. However, {{little is known about}} how changes in legal origin affect processes of economic development. Using non-European country data, this paper investigates the effect of legal origin on natural disaster <b>death</b> <b>tolls</b> <b>from</b> 1960 to 2008, and on the two periods 1960 – 1989 and 1990 – 2008. The key findings are that natural disaster <b>death</b> <b>tolls</b> are higher in French legal origin countries than in other countries in 1990 – 2008, but not in 1960 – 1989. This implies that the role of legal origin, in reducing the level of damage in a disaster, changes according to technological progress. ...|$|R
50|$|Civilian {{deaths are}} {{impossible}} to accurately estimate. While military deaths are invariably put at between 2.5 million and 3.5 million, civilian <b>death</b> <b>tolls</b> vary <b>from</b> 750,000 to 3 million. Thus estimates of total dead, both military and civilian, range from 3,250,000 to 6,500,000.|$|R
25|$|The {{location}} of the bomb inside the bus meant {{the front of the}} vehicle remained mostly intact. Most of the passengers {{at the front of the}} top deck survived, as did those near the front of the lower deck, including the driver, but those at the rear of the bus suffered more serious injuries. The extent of the damage caused to the victims' bodies resulted in a lengthy delay in announcing the <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> <b>from</b> the bombing while the police determined how many bodies were present and whether the bomber was one of them. Several passers-by were also injured by the explosion and surrounding buildings were damaged by debris.|$|E
25|$|Between November 1914 and April 1916, {{during the}} First World War, Baxter {{conducted}} inquests into {{the deaths of}} eleven German spies, including Karl Lody, who had been captured in Great Britain and tried and executed at the Tower of London. On 13 June 1917 the Germans launched the first daylight air raid over London. 17 Gotha G biplanes were flown from Belgium, dropping bombs on east London. 162people were killed and a further 426 were injured during the raid, being the highest <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> <b>from</b> a single air raid on Britain during that War. On 15 June 1917 Baxter presided over the inquests of 20 of the victims at Poplar.|$|E
25|$|Malaria was {{the biggest}} killer. From July 1943 through June 1944, the monthly <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> <b>from</b> malaria stood {{at an average of}} 125% over rates from the {{previous}} five years; in December 1943, the excess mortality was 203% over average. Malaria parasites were found in nearly 40% of all blood samples examined at Calcutta hospitals in 1943 during the peak period, November and December, and in nearly 52% in the same period in 1944. Moreover, since its symptoms often resemble those of other fatal fevers (such as kala-azar) and since only a small proportion of victims received medical care and were examined, statistics for malaria deaths are almost certainly underestimated.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{power plant}} {{accidents}} include the Chernobyl accident (1986) with approximately 60 deaths so far {{attributed to the}} accident and a predicted, eventual total <b>death</b> <b>toll,</b> of <b>from</b> 4000 to 25,000 latent cancers deaths. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (2011), has not caused any radiation related deaths, with a predicted, eventual total <b>death</b> <b>toll,</b> of <b>from</b> 0 to 1000, and the Three Mile Island accident (1979), no causal deaths, cancer or otherwise, {{have been found in}} follow up studies of this accident. Nuclear-powered submarine mishaps include the K-19 reactor accident (1961), the K-27 reactor accident (1968), and the K-431 reactor accident (1985).

50|$|By 1878-79 Church had {{acquired}} considerable wealth. Familiar {{with the high}} <b>death</b> <b>tolls</b> <b>from</b> the 1873 yellow fever epidemic, he moved his family to safety outside the city during the even worse epidemic of 1878, {{as well as the}} following year. As the city was depopulated by the flight of 25,000 people during the 1878 epidemic and <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> of more than 5,000, the land was devalued. Church saw a great opportunity in Memphis real estate and had the resources to buy up property holdings throughout the city. He acquired commercial buildings, some residential housing, and bars in the red-light district, as well as undeveloped land. It is estimated that in later years he was able to collect approximately $6,000 a month in rent from his properties.|$|R
