50|$|The Dutch West India Company {{had built}} Fort Singelenburgh {{at the site}} of the current fort in 1734, but the Dutch {{abandoned}} the fort in 1737, probably because of the Dutch siding with the defeated Akwamu in the Akyem-Akwamu conflict. The Danish had developed a presence in <b>Keta,</b> <b>the</b> commercial capital of the Anlo people. However, in 1783 when the Anlo people pillaged the local Danish agent, the Governor of Christiansborg raised an army drawn from people with a tradition of antipathy towards the Anlo: the Ada, Akwapim, Ga and Krobo. The Danes were thus able to defeat the Anlo and impose a treaty in 1784 which allowed them to build Fort Prinzenstein and obliged the Anlo to trade only with them.|$|E

40|$|For {{the purpose}} to {{immobilize}} salmon fry for marking, tricaine methanesulfonate (M. S. 222) {{has been used}} instead of ethyl carbamate (urethane) because the latter seems to have some harmful effects. According to Eisler and Backiel (1960), 14 species of fish were used to be anaesthetized with the M. S. 222 in various concentration by different authors. In general, anaesthetizing condition varies with the species, size of fish, duration of anaesthesia, concentration and temperature of the solution. The present experiment was undertaken to determine available concentration and duration of anaesthesia by this new anaesthetic for chum salmon fry (Oncorhynchus <b>keta).</b> <b>The</b> latent effect for the fry which recovered from anaesthesia was not observed...|$|E
30|$|The {{changes in}} the {{shoreline}} migration trend being experienced {{in the study area}} are due to several factors such as energetic wave action, storm surge, dam constructed on the Volta River in Akosombo, the low topography of the beach system and sea level rise (Sagoe-Addy and Appeaning Addo 2013, Giardino et al. 2018). The construction of coastal defense structures in Ada (the up-drift side of Fuvemeh) and the reduced sediment discharge from the Volta River (Boateng 2012) has affected the sediment regime in the area. The defense structures are made up of groynes, which traps sediment and thereby starve the down-drift side of sediment as observed by Angnuureng et al. (2013) in <b>Keta.</b> <b>The</b> action of the groynes further enhances the impact of the reduced sediment discharge from the Volta River which has resulted in the observed morphological changes.|$|E

40|$|Leptin {{plays an}} {{important}} role in energy homeostasis and reproductive function in fish, especially in reproduction. Migrating fish, such as salmonoids, are affected by external environmental factors, and salinity changes are a particularly important influence on spawning migrations. The aim of this study was to test whether changes in salinity affect the expression of leptin, estrogen receptors (ERs), and vitellogenin (VTG) in chum salmon (Oncorhynchus <b>keta).</b> <b>The</b> expression and activity of leptin, the expression of ERs and VTG, and the levels of estradiol- 17 Î² and cortisol increased after the fish were transferred to FW, demonstrating that changes in salinity stimulate the HPG axis in migrating female chum salmon. These findings reveal details about the role of elevated leptin levels and sex steroid hormones in stimulating sexual maturation and reproduction in response to salinity changes in chum salmon...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that anadromous Pacific salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) imprint to odorants in their natal streams during their seaward migration, and use olfaction to identify these during their homeward migration. Despite {{the importance of}} the olfactory organ during olfactory imprinting, the development of this structure is not well understood in Pacific salmon. Olfactory cues from the environment are relayed to the brain by the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in the olfactory organ. Thus, we analyzed morphometric changes in olfactory lamellae of the peripheral olfactory organ and in the quantity of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) during life history from alevin to mature in chum salmon (O. <b>keta).</b> <b>The</b> number of lamellae increased markedly during early development, reached 18 lamellae per unilateral peripheral olfactory organ in young salmon with a 200 mm in body size, and maintained this lamellar complement after young period. The number of ORNs per olfactory organ was about 180, 000 and 14. 2 million cells in fry and mature salmon, respectively. The relationship between the body size (fork length) and number of ORNs therefore revealed an allometric association. Our results represent the first quantitative analysis of the number of ORNs in Pacific salmon, and suggest that the number of ORNs is synchronized with the fork length throughout its life history...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of vertical transmission of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) was studied with the eggs of masu (cherry) salmon Oncorhynchus masou and chum salmon O. <b>keta.</b> <b>The</b> surfaces of eggs and sperm were contaminated with IHNV (10 ^ 3. 8 - 10 ^ 4. 8 50 % tissue culture infective dose [TCID 50]/egg) {{and then the}} eggs were fertilized. Eggs just after fertilization and embryonated eggs also were infected by injection with IHNV (10 ^ 3. 8 TCID 50 /egg) directly into the yolk. During incubation, eggs were held in running water at 10 â„ƒ. Mortality of the eggs or hatched progeny was determined and isolation of IHNV on the surface or inside of the eggs was determined during the incubation period. No mortality occurred and no virus was detected in fertile eggs from contaminated gametes. For injected eggs, IHNV was not detected {{on the surface of}} masu and chum salmon eggs after 1 d of incubation. Infectivity of IHNV inside the eggs decreased gradually and could not be detected after 1 month of incubation. This rate of IHNV reduction in the fertilized egg was similar to that found in a mixture of IHNV and homogenized yolk contents. Several individual yolk components also showed anti-IHNV activity. When eyed eggs were injected with IHNV, the embryos of both masu and chum salmon became infected, and the concentration of virus increased rapidly and reached more than 10 ^ 6. 5 TCID 50 /fish. The cumulative mortality of eggs injected at the eyed stage for both masu and chum salmon was 90 %. The susceptibilities of hatched-out larvae of masu and chum salmon to IHNV were different; cumulative mortality was more than 90 % in masu salmon and 20 - 30 % in chum salmon artificially infected with the virus. We concluded that vertical transmission of IHNV is doubtful because the virus is apparently unable to survive in eggs before the eyed stage...|$|E
