By 1958, engineers were urging that the river be cleaned up to reduce flooding. Still, <b>illegal</b> <b>dumping</b> and overflows continued. For example, storm runoff gave the Yonkers section the river's highest concentrations of heavy metals, PCBs, and other chemicals, {{according to a study}} of the river in 1983, the year the city stopped using the Saw Mill as its primary water source. A decade later, the sediment in the Saw Mill had the highest concentration of metals in the United States Geological Survey's entire water-quality assessment program.|$|E

The project ZmapujTo is intended for all {{people who want to}} live in a clean environment in their cities, villages or countryside and additionally want to raise awareness of unacceptable environmental behaviour of people. Users of this GIS based mobile application can report <b>illegal</b> <b>dumps</b> quickly and easily by using their smartphones/tablets. Thus, everybody can use this interactive public web form to report <b>illegal</b> <b>dumps</b> in the Czech Republic. The objective of this project is to contribute to reduce environmental pollution caused by <b>illegal</b> <b>dumps</b> in the Czech Republic by making available a modern, effective and widespread platform for reporting and monitoring of <b>illegal</b> <b>dumps...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objectives. Adverse {{effects of}} waste {{management}} represent {{a public health}} issue. Mortality meta-analysis in Italian National Priority Contaminated Sites (NPCSs) with industrial waste landfills or <b>illegal</b> <b>dumps</b> is presented. Methods. 24 NPCSs include industrial waste landfills or <b>illegal</b> <b>dumps.</b> Class 1 (10 NPCSs with industrial waste landfills) and Class 2 (14 NPCSs with <b>illegal</b> <b>dumps)</b> were categorized. Random-effects model meta-analyses of Standardized Mortality Ratios non-adjusted (SMRs) and adjusted for Deprivation (DI-SMRs) computed for each CS (1995 - 2002) were performed for overall 24 NPCSs and the two classes. The North-Southern gradient was considered. Results. 24 CSs pooled-SMRs are significantly increased in both genders for cancer of liver (men: SMR = 1. 13; women: SMR = 1. 18), bladder (men: SMR = 1. 06; women: SMR = 1. 11), and for cirrhosis (men: SMR = 1. 09; women: SMR = 1. 13). In Class 2 the increase is confirmed in both genders for liver and bladder cancers and for cirrhosis and in men only for lung cancer. Congenital anomalies and adverse perinatal conditions are not increased. Conclusion. The {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis of adverse health effects of non-adequately managed hazardous waste. Causal interpretation is not allowed, but the meta-analytic approach provides more confidence in the findings...|$|R

25|$|The primary {{operational}} goal {{of satellite}} AIS is {{the gathering of}} positioning and course information from fisheries and ship traffic within the Norwegian EEZ {{with the intent of}} environmental surveillance. The vessel data is used by the Coastal Administration and in particular Vardø Vessel Traffic Service Centre to monitor ship traffic. The data is stored and {{can also be used to}} collect accurate statistics on ship traffic in the Arctic. Unlike terrestrial data collection, the satellite information is not made publicly available. A contributing cause is that certain fishers many not want to reveal their fishing positions and could then have chosen to turn off their AIS instead. Data can also be used to identify any ship causing an oil spill. There are more than one thousand annual oil spills and <b>illegal</b> <b>dumping</b> in Norwegian waters. While observation satellites have previously been able to identify spills, the satellite AIS monitoring can normally identify the culprit and the data used as evidence.|$|E

What writer tend to go thorough is the implementation of law enforcement against illegal TPSS in Sleman district and the obstacle of law enforcement against the illegal TPSS. Writer use empirical approach in doing the research which focuses on law behavior. The result after observation is that the law enforcement on illegal TPSS have been done by local government in Sleman which is “Kantor Lingkungan Hidup”, “Dinas Pekerjaan Umum Pertamanan”, and “Satuan Polisi Pamong Praja”. Unfortunately, the law enforcement haven’t goes well because there’re no decisive actions for the violators. This happen because of any other constraints such as {{there are many different}} views between the law enforcement’s officer in understanding and interpreting the legislation about <b>illegal</b> <b>dumps.</b> The verification of contamination or enviroment destruction {{because of the}} <b>illegal</b> <b>dumps</b> is not an easy things to do because it needs a big amount of cost to acknowledge the community and that become one of the heavy burden for the government.

500|$|The Zarqa {{river is}} highly polluted. In many areas, raw sewage flows {{untreated}} {{directly into the}} river through dry riverbeds (wadis), contaminating it and creating a stench {{which has been a}} cause of numerous complaints, particularly during the summer months. [...] Though sewage treatment stations have been built in a couple of locations (including Ain Ghazal and Khirbet As Samra), these stations often receive more water than they can handle. Such overflow occurs during winter floods, as well as during summer months when the population increases with the return of migrant workers to Amman. During overflow, untreated water runs directly to the Zarqa river. As a result, the Zarqa's water is brownish colored, often with dense foam due to large amounts of organic matter. Other sources of pollutants are the <b>illegal</b> <b>dumping</b> of industrial waste, including those from textile factories, and batteries and oils from garages.|$|E

The article noted that [...] "residents have to walk up to [...] along a dangerously busy road or through a bush track to reach a shop or bus stop", and that the nearest primary school is [...] away. Nine derelict homes in the community were being refurbished under a training scheme to assist young community members to gain skills, although the community claimed that funding was only available for 12-month periods, making apprenticeships (which run for several years) impossible to offer.

The program won Patton statewide acclaim. When Patton sought re-election in 1985, he again faced Rutherford in the Democratic primary. Rutherford campaigned against the garbage-collection program, promising to repeal it if elected.
