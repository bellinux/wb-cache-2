5000|$|Zip-cord {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} cable with two or more conductors held together by an <b>insulating</b> <b>jacket</b> that can be easily separated simply by pulling apart. The term is also used with optical fiber cables consisting of two optical fibers joined in a similar manner. The design of zip-cord makes it easy to keep conductors that carry related electrical or optical signals together and helps avoid tangling of cables. Typical uses include lamp cord and speaker wire. Conductors may be identified by a color tracer on the insulation, or by a ridge molded into the insulation of one wire, or by a colored tracer thread inside the insulation. Zip cords are intended for use on portable equipment, and the US and Canadian electrical codes do not permit their use for permanently installed wiring of line-voltage circuits.|$|E
50|$|Coaxial cable conducts {{electrical}} signal using an inner conductor (usually a solid copper, stranded copper or copper plated steel wire) {{surrounded by an}} insulating layer and all enclosed by a shield, typically one to four layers of woven metallic braid and metallic tape. The cable is protected by an outer <b>insulating</b> <b>jacket.</b> Normally, the shield is kept at ground potential and a signal carrying voltage {{is applied to the}} center conductor. The advantage of coaxial design is that electric and magnetic fields are restricted to the dielectric with little leakage outside the shield. Conversely, electric and magnetic fields outside the cable are largely kept from interfering with signals inside the cable. Larger diameter cables and cables with multiple shields have less leakage.

Tests were carried out in laboratory and results were used for the determination of the shear modulus and strength of the wall panels before and after the application of the GFRP reinforcement. Retrofitted panels exhibited a significant enhancement in the lateral capacity when compared to the control panels. The thermal performance of the proposed mortars was also investigated both with and without GFRP. Low values of thermal conductivity were found, especially for the samples with GFRP; a reduction of the thermal transmittance value in the 34 – 45 % range was also obtained by applying 45 mm layer of coating in conventional masonry walls...|$|R
40|$|Long thin {{flexible}} cylinders instrumented with acoustic sensors {{are used}} by the Navy for surveillance and detection. Acoustic transducers are mounted in a long linear array surrounded by an <b>insulated</b> <b>jacketing</b> material resulting in a long flexible array of sensors with a smooth outer surface. These cylinders, called towed arrays, are towed behind ships and submarines. As {{a result of the}} towing speed, a turbulent boundary layer develops along the outer boundary of the flexible cylinder which generates noise in the near field. Flow noise is critical to the measured acoustic signatures and therefore, to system performance. By understanding the nature of turbulent boundary layers on long, thin flexible cylinders, the performance of towed acoustic sensors used for surveillance and tactical operations can be improved. Towed array detection performance is a function of several factors including ambient acoustics, array gain, flow noise, and signal processing. To advance existing systems, the primary goal is to increase the system gain by introducing longer apertures, i. e. longer arrays. Longer arrays of conventional design lead to additional stowage requirements that are difficult to implement. The development of very small diamete...|$|R
40|$|The Rhodotron is a high-voltage, {{high-power}} {{electron beam}} accelerator {{based on a}} design concept first proposed in 1989 by J. Pottier of the French Atomic Agency, Commissariat a 1 'Energie Atomique (CEA). In December 1991, the Belgian particle accelerator manufacturer, Ion Beam Applications s. a. (IBA) entered into an exclusive agreement with the CEA to develop and industrialize the Rhodotron. Electron beams have long been used as the preferential method to cross-link a variety of polymers, either in their bulk state or in their final form. Used extensively in the wire and cable industry to toughen <b>insulating</b> <b>jackets,</b> electron beam-treated plastics can demonstrate improved tensile and impact strength, greater abrasion resistance, increased temperature resistance and dramatically improved fire retardation. Electron beams are used to selectively cross-link or degrade {{a wide range of}} polymers in resin pellets form. Electron beams are also used for rapid curing of advanced composites, for cross-linking of floor-heating and sanitary pipes and for cross-linking of formed plastic parts. Other applications include: in-house and contract medical device sterilization, food irradiation in both electron and X-ray modes, pulp processing, electron beam doping of semi-conductors, gemstone coloration and general irradiation research. IBA currently markets three models of the Rhodotron, all capable of 10 MeV and alternate beam energies from 3 MeV upwards. The Rhodotron models TT 100, TT 200 and TT 300 are typically specified with guaranteed beam powers of 35, 80 and 150 kW, respectively.

50|$|Reduction {{in weight}} of {{the second of the}} big three, the {{sleeping}} system, is achieved through reduction of the quantity of fabric used in its manufacture or through use of lighterweight materials in its construction. The use of down as an insulation material which is lighter by volume than currently available synthetic fibers will decrease bag weight but alternately suffer from its susceptibility to loft loss caused by moisture. Reducing the overall weight of a sleeping bag by eliminating superfluous material will reduce its weight. An example of this is the use of a sleeping quilt or top bag. A sleeping quilt is a bottom-less insulated blanket which has no insulation on its bottom side, relying on the user's sleeping pad to guard against conductive heat loss into the ground. A top bag is more like a conventional sleeping bag in that it wraps around the user's entire body but the bottom fabric contains no insulation. The philosophy behind these two alternatives is that insulation crushed under a person's weight is devoid of air and therefore useless. Some modern down sleeping bags are through-baffled and under-filled such that the user can shift all the insulation to the top of their body thereby maximizing its potential to retain heat. Ultralight hikers also tend to carry bags rated for warmer temperatures than traditional-weight backpackers, making up the difference on cold nights by wearing insulated clothing to bed, such as a balaclava or an <b>insulated</b> <b>jacket.</b> Proper camping site selection that avoids colder hollows (low points where cold air tends to collect) or that makes use of natural wind barriers such as thick vegetation or cliffs makes up the difference in heat lost by lighter gear.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe PEEK/PEI/PES plastic alloys were {{processed}} by twin-screw extruder at 370 °C with five mass ratios of 70 / 30 / 0, 70 / 25 / 5, 65 / 30 / 5, 60 / 30 / 10, and 60 / 35 / 5, respectively. Their thermal properties and crystallization behavior were {{investigated by the}} differential scanning calorimetry. The measured results showed that all the plastic alloys had a single glass-transition temperature (Tg), which revealed good compatibility among the three members of PEEK, PEI and PES. For the alloy with the mass ratio of 70 / 30 / 0, the minimum Tg of 160. 6 °C was obtained, but the alloy of 60 / 35 / 5 had the maximum Tg of 164. 5 °C, which indicate that PEI, PES and the amorphous plastics could increase Tg of the PEEK alloys and was 20 °C {{higher than that of}} pure PEEK. The melting points (Tm) of these alloys were from 334. 4 °C to 336. 3 °C and their crystallinity degrees were from 35. 8 % to 37. 8 %, whereas both were slightly higher than that of pure PEEK. However, the cold crystallization temperatures of the alloys were lower than that of pure PEEK, which could be attributed to the reason that the rheological properties of the alloys were improved by PEI. Tensile strength of the plastic alloy with the ratio of 60 / 30 / 10 presented the maximum value of 108 MPa and was higher than that of pure PEEK. After thermal ageing at 158 °C (below Tg) or 178 °C (above Tg) respectively for 168 h, their tensile strengths decreased only slightly, but elongation rates at break reduced significantly, of which thermal ageing above Tg would recede the elongation at break more severely.

Ignoring the heat losses occurred during the SAGD experiments adversely affects the quantitative and qualitative results acquired due to the excessive steam condensation. During drainage of the mobile oil from an experimental model in the SAGD process, the overall heat loss increases with time (i.e. the more oil drains out of the model, the more depleted area is available for the heat loss). Use of an effective vacuum environment can significantly limit different heat transfer mechanisms. For instance, a vacuum pressure of 0.01  torr or less is required for significant reduction of the heat loss through conduction mechanism (Roth 1990). Moreover, to establish an <b>insulating</b> vacuum <b>jacket</b> for minimizing convective element of the heat transfer, it is required to achieve an extremely low vacuum pressure of about 1  ×  10 − 6  torr (Guyer 1999).|$|R
