50|$|The {{importance}} of {{large quantities of}} detailed and varied demographic data increased as India moved towards adoption of five-year development plans. Yeatts was appointed as Commissioner for the 1951 Census of India but died in 1948 {{and was replaced by}} R. A. Gopalaswami. The new incumbent refused to be swayed, as Yeatts had been, by the arguments of Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis regarding adoption of sampling methods. Mahalanobis had founded the Indian Statistical Institute but was no match for Gopalaswami, who successfully argued that the diversity of the Indian populace — such as its multilinguality and multiethnicity — was so extreme that no sample would have any statistical utility for planning purposes. The use of <b>individual</b> <b>enumeration</b> slips, combined with household schedules, was retained but the slips were simplified as much as possible in order to maximise the accuracy of information derived from a population that had limited capabilities.|$|E

40|$|A {{geographical}} {{association between}} respiratory cancer {{and air pollution}} from steel foundries has been shown previously in Scotland and elsewhere. In the present study the iron-founding town of Kirkintilloch {{was found to have}} standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) for respiratory cancer in 1959 - 63, 1964 - 8, and 1969 - 73 that were unexceptional in comparison with Scotland. Nevertheless, when SMRs were calculated for respiratory cancer for the period 1966 - 76 in five zones of the town arranged, a priori, according to probable exposure to fumes from two iron foundries, and in the <b>individual</b> <b>enumeration</b> districts of the 1971 census, higher SMRs were found in the residential areas most exposed to pollution from the foundries. The gradient of the zones' SMRs [...] high close to the foundries to low at some distance from them [...] persisted despite standardisation of the SMRs for social class. A survey of the concentrations of several metals in soil cores sampled at 51 sites throughout the town showed a pattern of pollution that probably illustrated the effects of prevailing winds and topography on the pollution plumes from the foundries. The value of sampling soil cores in investigations where historical sources of metallic air pollution are of epidemiological interest was emphasised by the detection of high concentrations of Ni in an area where a nickel refinery had been located many decades previously...|$|E
40|$|Many joint {{decisions}} {{in everyday life}} (e. g., Which bar is less crowded?) depend on approximate enumeration, but very {{little is known about}} the psychological characteristics of counting together. Here we systematically investigated collective approximate enumeration. Pairs of participants made <b>individual</b> and collective <b>enumeration</b> judgments in a 2 -alternative forced-choice task and when in disagreement, they negotiated joint decisions via verbal communication and received feedback about accuracy at the end of each trial. The results showed that two people could collectively count better than either one alone, but not as well as expected by previous models of collective sensory decision making in more basic perceptual domains (e. g., luminance contrast). Moreover, such collective enumeration benefited from prior, noninteractive practice showing that social learning of how to combine shared information about <b>enumeration</b> required substantial <b>individual</b> experience. Finally, the collective context had a positive but transient impact on an <b>individual’s</b> <b>enumeration</b> sensitivity. This transient social influence may be explained as a motivational factor arising from the fact that members of a collective must take responsibility for their individual decisions and face the consequences of their judgments...|$|R

40|$|This master’s thesis {{deals with}} usage of burn-up (spent) nuclear fuel in {{nuclear power plants}} of next {{generation}} – accelerator driven transmutation plants which is produced in current nuclear power plants. This system could significantly reduce the volume of dangerous long-lived radioisotopes and moreover {{they would be able}} to take advantage of its great energy potential due to fast neutron spectrum. In the introduction are listed basic knowledge and aspects of spent nuclear fuel along with its reprocessing and the possibility of further use while minimizing environmental impact. As another point detailed description of accelerator driven systems is described together with its basic components. In addition this search is followed by <b>individual</b> chronological <b>enumeration</b> of projects of global significance concerning their current development. Emphasis is placed on SAD and MYRRHA projects, which are used like base for calculations. This last, computational part, deals with the creation of the geometry of subcritical transmutation reactor driven by accelerator and subsequent evaluation which assembly is the most effective for transmutation and energy purposes along with changing of target, nuclear fuel and coolant/moderator...|$|R
40|$|Injuries in {{childhood}} are {{strongly related to}} poverty at the household level and to living in a deprived neighbourhood, {{but it is not}} clear whether these effects are independent. In this prospective population study, all injuries to 5 - 14 year old children living in the city of Norwich, UK, and presented at the hospital Accident and Emergency Department over a 13 month period were recorded (N= 3526). Information on the population of resident children and household composition was assembled from the health authority population register. Neighbourhood information was extracted from the census and local surveys. Unadjusted risks were calculated for individual and neighbourhood factors, followed by multilevel modelling in which predictors were included at three levels: <b>individual,</b> <b>enumeration</b> district and social area (neighbourhood). The overall injury rate was 16. 44 per 100 children per year. Injury rates between neighbourhoods varied two-fold and were highest in more deprived areas. In the final multilevel model injury risk was related to gender (boys vs. girls OR= 1. 35), age of child (OR= 1. 07 per year), number of adults in the household (OR= 0. 91 per adult), and age gap between child and eldest female (15 - 24 years vs. 25 - 34 years, OR= 1. 15). Injury rates were also related to social area deprivation, although variations in injury rates between neighbourhoods were not wholly explained by deprivation. The adjusted odds ratio between the most and least deprived social areas was 1. 35. Excluding less serious injuries did not substantially change the results. The risks were very similar to those found in a previous study of pre-school children, with the same neighbourhoods identified as high and low risk as before. This evidence that neighbourhood factors independently influence injury risk over and above individual and household factors supports the use of area-based policies to reduce injuries in children.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} framework of estimating the population totals from the Census, Survey and an Administrative Records List {{is based on}} capture-recapture methodology which has traditionally been employed for the measurement of abundance of biological populations. Under this framework, in order to estimate the unknown population total, N, an initial set of individuals is captured. Further subsequent captures are taken at later periods. The possible capture histories can be represented by the cells of a 2 r contingency table, where r {{is the number of}} captures. This contingency table will have one cell missing, corresponding to the population missed in all r captures. If this cell count can be estimated, adding this to the sum of the observed cells will yield the population size of interest. There are a number of models that may be specified based on the incomplete (2 r - 1) table of observed counts, and if a model is found that adequately fits these observed counts an estimate of the unobserved cell can be derived. The thesis will be concentrating on the log-linear model specification of capture-recapture models. In the simplest capture-recapture model, there are two lists (for example, a Census and a Survey) leading to a 2 x 2 contingency table, with three observed counts and an unobserved cell count. By assuming there is independence between the Census and Survey, an estimate of the unobserved cell can be obtained. It will be shown that when there is information from individual capture in the Census, Survey and a third (the Administrative List) it is possible to account for different dependencies, specifically the association between capture in the Census and Survey. The assumption of independence which is pivotal to the case when there are only two captures can now be relaxed. However, the introduction of the Administrative List means that overenumeration cannot be assumed to be negligible. Therefore, the proposal is to use latent class models, where the idea {{is that there is a}} latent variable with two classes - one representing the real enumerations and the other, erroneous enumerations. Under the classical parameterisation of latent class models, there is the assumption of local independence, implying that the Census, Survey and Administrative List are conditionally independent given the latent variable. Consequently, when an <b>individual’s</b> <b>enumeration</b> in the Census is associated with their enumeration in the Survey this latent model is invalidated. There are a number of locally dependent latent class models, but within a triple system scenario most encounter problems regarding model identifiability; to be precise, the model solutions are not unique. Thus the thesis investigates the use of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to fit a locally dependent (and identifiable) latent model to capture-recapture data from three systems...|$|R

40|$|Vibrio vulnificus is an {{opportunistic}} {{human pathogen}} {{commonly found in}} estuarine environments. Infections are associated with raw oyster consumption and can produce rapidly fatal septicemia in susceptible <b>individuals.</b> Standard <b>enumeration</b> of this organism in shellfish or seawater is laborious and inaccurate; therefore, more efficient assays are needed. An oligonucleotide probe derived from the cytolysin gene, vvhA, was previously used for colony hybridizations to enumerate V. vulnificus. However, this method requires overnight growth, and vibrios may lack culturability under certain conditions. In the present study, we targeted the same locus for development of a TaqMan real-time PCR assay. Probe specificity was confirmed by amplification of 28 V. vulnificus templates and {{by the lack of}} a PCR product with 22 non-V. vulnificus strains. Detection of V. vulnificus in pure cultures was observed over a 6 -log-unit linear range of concentration (102 to 108 CFU ml− 1), with a lower limit of 72 fg of genomic DNA μl of PCR mixture− 1 or the equivalent of six cells. Similar sensitivity was observed in DNA extracted from mixtures of V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus cells. Real-time PCR enumeration of artificially inoculated oyster homogenates correlated well with colony hybridization counts (r 2 = 0. 97). Numbers of indigenous V. vulnificus cells in oysters by real-time PCR showed no significant differences from numbers from plate counts with probe (t test; P = 0. 43). Viable but nonculturable cells were also enumerated by real-time PCR and confirmed by the BacLight viability assay. These data indicate that real-time PCR can provide sensitive species-specific detection and enumeration of V. vulnificus in seafood...|$|R

The aims of the project were as follows : to collect and process information from the data relating to the Welsh language in the 1891 Census Enumerators' Returns in 20 selected communities in Wales; to create computer-readable data files on the language ability of around 90, 000 individuals, i. e. five per cent of the population; to undertake a quantitative analysis of the socio-economic structure of Welsh/English language ability {{on the basis of}} the above data; to develop a classification of occupations in order to explore links between economic activity and the process of language change; to write a volume {{on the basis of the}} above in order to deepen our socio-cultural understanding of a society in which nearly a million people spoke Welsh and over half a million were monoglot Welsh. Main Topics : The dataset contains 35 files, each of which consists of a 100 per cent sample of the enumeration district in twenty communities selected from the 178 sub-registration districts in Wales, i. e. 90, 000 individuals or five per cent of the total population of wales in 1891. Two specific datafiles were created for each district. Variables in the first file identify : the <b>individual</b> person, <b>enumeration</b> district, schedule number, first name, surname, relation to head of household, marital status, gender, age, occupation, employment status, occupation code, country/county of birth, birthplace and language spoken. Variables in the second file identify : the enumeration district, schedule number, whether a Welsh-language schedule was used, number of persons in the household, number of rooms and address...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{arrangement}} {{is known to}} influence enumeration times in vision. In haptic enumeration, {{it has been shown}} that dividing the total number of items over the two hands can speed up enumeration. Here we investigated how spatial arrangement of items and non-items presented to the <b>individual</b> fingers impacts <b>enumeration</b> times. More specifically, we tested whether grouping by proximity facilitates haptic serial enumeration (counting). Participants were asked to report the number of tangible items, amongst non-items, presented to the finger pads of both hands. In the first experiment, we divided the tangible items in one, two, or three groups that were defined by proximity (i. e., one nonitem in between two groups) and found that number of groups and not number of items were the critical factor in enumeration times. In a second experiment, we found that this grouping even takes place when groups extend across fingers of both hands. These results suggest that grouping by proximity affects haptic serial enumeration and that this grouping takes place on a spatial level possibly in addition to the somatotopic level. Our results support the idea that grouping by proximity, a principle introduced in vision, also greatly affects haptic processing of spatial information...|$|R
40|$|Surveys in China {{conventionally}} {{sample from}} local area residential registers, which until recently {{have been of}} sufficient accuracy to function as de facto population registers. Due {{to a combination of}} large scale internal migration and massive replacement of housing in urban areas, a large fraction of the population currently does not live where registered. Individuals not living where registered are thus ineligible for inclusion in conventionally generated samples. Surveys whose samples depend on access to residential registers are inherently based on an under-enumeration of the population, as well as on a biased representation of the population due to exclusion of unregistered local residents. We report conclusions from, and observations related to, a pilot study designed to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a sampling method that does not depend on residential registers. In the pilot we (1) purposively selected small areas; (2) enumerated the small areas; (3) randomly sampled <b>individuals</b> from the <b>enumeration</b> lists; and (4) interviewed sampled individuals. This approach substantially reduced the underenumeration problem. As implemented, however, its point of departure required previously selected small areas.

Methods Data from the cross-sectional Caerphilly Health and Social Needs Survey were analysed using multilevel modelling, with <b>individuals</b> nested within <b>enumeration</b> districts. In {{this study we}} used the responses of people under 75 years of age (n = 10, 892). The response rate of this subgroup was 62. 3 %. All individual responses were geo-referenced to the 325 census enumeration districts of Caerphilly county borough. Results The neighbourhood attributes of poor access to amenities, poor neighbourhood quality, neighbourhood disorder, lack of social cohesion, and neighbourhood deprivation were associated with the reporting of poor health. These effects were attenuated when controlling for individual and collective socio-economic status. Lack of social cohesion significantly increased the odds of women reporting poor health, but did not increase the odds of men reporting poor health. In contrast, unemployment significantly affected men's health, but not women's health. Conclusion This study shows that different aspects of the neighbourhood environment are associated with people's self rated health, which may partly reflect the health impacts of neighbourhood socio-economic status. The findings further suggest that the social environment is more important for women's health, but that individual socio-economic status is more important for men's health. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{first in}} silico models of self-reproduction only {{focused on the}} logic of the {{mechanisms}} that execute and copy the genome or renew the membrane, but neglected associated physical constraints. This may have resulted from modeling through cellular automata, which are unable to represent the cohesion of objects in movement and interaction. In previous work I presented a new, well structured and powerful tool based on a graph rewriting system embedded in a spatial automaton. This tool employs combinations of a unique symbol and can represent an unlimited variety of moving and interacting objects. As transitions are local and occur at random, each trajectory of the system differs. However, dependent events can always be represented in their natural order. With this tool, I built a representation of an autopoietic individual. More recently, I hypothesized that this model could also be used to demonstrate self-reproduction because most of the mechanisms required for growth are already available in the autopoietic individual and few additional functions are needed. Here, I report the advancement of the model to demonstrate the ability of the autopoietic individual to self-reproduce. During self-reproduction, autopoiesis remains active and the lifespans of the various components are unchanged. Pathological morphologies can be observed when some metabolic pathways are disturbed. Using appropriate approximations, some thermodynamic parameters can be evaluated. Additionally, a second autopoietic and self-reproductive individual can be represented within the same environment. Further, the model could be used to describe the space phase domain and invariants characteristics of each of these <b>individuals,</b> whose systematic <b>enumeration</b> and classification can be envisioned. Based on this model, I propose that autopoiesis facilitates self-reproduction...|$|R
