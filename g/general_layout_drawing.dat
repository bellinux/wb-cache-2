40|$|For {{the last}} few decades, {{three-dimensional}} human simulation tools have complemented the traditional method of using 2 D templates. Human simulation tools are, for example, used for optimizing comfort, fit, reach and vision. In this study, two other methods will be adopted to assist present method of using a 2 D SAE template. The other methods will be by measurements and using ergonomic software. Measurement is done by using <b>general</b> <b>layout</b> <b>drawing</b> of benchmark vehicles [...] Ergonomic tool {{that will be used}} for this study is Ramsis. Anthropometrics data used will be based on 95...|$|E

The program computes the optimal number of tube count and lays out drawing with respecting constraints, including the shell ID, number of passes, center to center distance of tubes and tube outer diameter. Tubesheet <b>layout</b> <b>drawing</b> {{can be used as}} template for actual tubesheet. Furthermore the program is validated with open literature and shown good agreement with it. Besides the tubesheet for Heat exchangers this method can be extended to the tube counts of sheave plates and perforated plates of distillation column and Cooling Towers...|$|R
