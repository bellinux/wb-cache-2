5|$|When {{radially}} broaching workpieces {{that require}} a <b>deep</b> <b>cut</b> per tooth, such as forgings or castings, a rotor-cut or jump-cut design can be used; these broaches are also known as free egress or nibbling broaches. In this design the RPT is designated {{to two or three}} rows of teeth. For the broach to work the first tooth of that cluster has a wide notch, or undercut, and then the next tooth has a smaller notch (in a three tooth design) and the final tooth has no notch. This allows for a <b>deep</b> <b>cut</b> while keeping stresses, forces, and power requirements low.|$|E
5|$|As {{noted by}} Arthur M. Greenhall:If there is fur {{on the skin}} of the host, the common vampire bat uses its canine and cheek teeth like a barber's blades to shave away the hairs. The bat's razor-sharp upper incisor teeth then make a 7mm wide and 8mm <b>deep</b> <b>cut.</b> The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them {{permanently}} razor sharp. Their teeth are so sharp, even handling their skulls in a museum can result in cuts.|$|E
5|$|Eragon and the Varden {{are then}} {{attacked}} by the Kull, {{as well as the}} rest of the Urgal army. Eragon personally battles Durza again, and succeeds in stabbing him in the heart with Zar'roc, but Durza slashes a <b>deep</b> <b>cut</b> like Murtagh's on his back. He then passes out, and is visited telepathically by a stranger while he is unconscious who tells Eragon to visit him in the Elven capital, Ellesméra.|$|E

5|$|It was {{reported}} following Hard Justice that Shane Douglas was originally supposed to handle interview duties for the show, but {{came down with}} the stomach flu {{and was replaced by}} Terry Taylor. Also, that Jeff Hardy missed multiple flights causing him to arrive after the conclusion of the show. Hardy was subsequently suspended for this and past instances of no-showing events. Abyss and Ron Killings were the only ones to receive injuries at Hard Justice. Abyss was given a fairly <b>deep</b> <b>cut</b> {{on the top of his}} head from being bashed with a steel chair by Killings that required stitches. Meanwhile, Killings cracked his front teeth after falling face-first onto a steel chair.|$|E
5|$|Robben scored {{his first}} {{goals of the}} 2013–14 season in the 2013 DFL-Supercup, a 4–2 defeat to Borussia Dortmund. On 9 August 2013, his opening goal helped Bayern to a 3–1 win over Borussia Mönchengladbach in their first match of the 2013–14 Bundesliga campaign. On 17 September, he scored in Bayern's Champions League opener against CSKA Moscow at the Allianz Arena. He went on to score two further goals during the Champions League group stage; in away wins against Manchester City and CSKA as Bayern {{finished}} as group winners.

On 4 December, Robben was substituted with a <b>deep</b> <b>cut</b> on his right knee in a 2–0 DFB-Pokal win away to FC Augsburg which prevented him from taking part in the 2013 FIFA Club World Cup.|$|E
5|$|The turnpike {{commission}} {{announced plans}} to build a second bore at the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel and a four-lane bypass of the Laurel Hill Tunnel in 1960. A bypass was planned for the Laurel Hill Tunnel because traffic would be more quickly and less expensively relieved than it would by boring another tunnel. In 1962, the turnpike commission approved these two projects. That August, $21 million in bonds were sold to finance the two projects. The Laurel Hill Tunnel was bypassed using a <b>deep</b> <b>cut</b> to the north; it would feature a wide median, truck climbing lanes, and a -deep cut into the mountain. Groundbreaking for the new alignment took place on September 6, 1962. This bypass opened to traffic on October 30, 1964 at a cost of $7.5 million. Work on boring the second tube at Allegheny Mountain Tunnel also began on September 6, 1962. The former South Pennsylvania Railroad tunnel was considered, but was again rejected because of its poor condition. On March 15, 1965, the new tube opened to traffic, after which the original tube was closed to allow updates to be made. It reopened on August 25, 1966. The construction of the second tube at Allegheny Mountain cost $12 million.|$|E

25|$|Building {{the last}} 50-mile segment proved {{difficult}} and expensive. Allen Bowie Davis {{took on the}} role of management. In Cumberland, Dam No. 8 and Guard Lock No. 8 had begun construction in 1837 and the final locks (70-75) to Cumberland were completed around 1840. That left an 18½ mile segment in the middle, which would eventually require building the Paw Paw tunnel, digging the <b>deep</b> <b>cut</b> at Oldtown, and building 17 locks.|$|E

25|$|Praxis almost {{disappeared}} {{in the years after}} the 25 de Abril revolution of 1974. Timidly it was reinstated in the 1980s. However the significance of the traditional academic attire changed substantially. In earlier centuries it was common practice for a student to wear if for the length of his studies. Students occasionally slept in it when consumption of wine frustrated their efforts to reach home. The cape would {{get to the end of}} studies, heavily cut by friends and particularly with a <b>deep</b> <b>cut</b> for each girlfriend. Today the academic attire is a ceremonial dress to use in formal students ceremonial. It is also somewhat expensive, and not the practical dress of time past.|$|E

500|$|The {{evidence}} for {{the layout of the}} second mansio is also very fragmentary. It was a courtyard building constructed with posts set vertically in foundation trenches.The walls were plaster and daub and some rooms were painted in vivid colours. In the courtyard was a large well [...] and [...] <b>deep,</b> <b>cut</b> into the underlying sandstone. The second mansio was deliberately dismantled in about 140–150CE during construction of the third mansio. The well was filled in at this time and contained a samian sherd dated 125–145CE. About the same time the second hilltop fort was abandoned and the town ceased to be a military site. One of the last military features at Letocetum was the [...] "punic ditch" [...] associated with this last small fort. The ditch was filled before any secondary silt formed and the filling contained a Trajanic coin dated 98–117CE and pottery suggesting a Hadrianic or early Antonine date.|$|E
500|$|Ralf Schumacher, who {{was running}} fourth, crashed heavily into the turn one {{barriers}} on the 38th lap. He suffered a <b>deep</b> <b>cut</b> to his leg and was taken to hospital. Michael Schumacher held a 36-second lead over Coulthard by lap 38 and the latter lapped consistently in the low 1:22 range to close the gap. Verstappen made the first scheduled pit stop on lap 41, five laps in front of Zonta and Heidfeld. Michael Schumacher made a pit stop on lap 49 and retained the first position. Fisichella made a pit stop earlier than expected on lap 51 as he had a slow [...] developing. Frentzen, Barrichello, Salo, Villeneuve and Coulthard made pit stops over the following six laps. After Coulthard emerged from the pit lane, Michael Schumacher's car suffered a broken exhaust which broke his left rear suspension and Schumacher was forced to retire.|$|E
