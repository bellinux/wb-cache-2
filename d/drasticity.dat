The signers of the declaration demanded the equality of the four Yugoslav languages {{and the use of}} the Croatian literary language in schools and media. State authorities were accused of imposing of Serbian as official language. A unitarianist trend was strongest in the language area, but resistance to that policy was evident. Yugounitarists, especially those of Croat origin, and Greater Serbian elements, comprehended that theirs final goal was essentially endangered and that Croat linguistic mutiny must be energically broken. The force and <b>drasticity</b> of reaction had a goal of intimidation and breaking of moral; yugounitarists wanted to create the atmosphere of apathy and lowness of spirits among Croat masses and intellectuals, even bigger one than it existed before the Declaration... (...) The declaration proved that the Novi Sad agreementwas a house of cards. Dalibor Brozović The demands were rejected, and the Croatian Spring (MASPOK) movement was stopped. However, the Declaration was taken into consideration in the new Yugoslav constitution of 1974. Nearly all requests were granted in the formulation, and it remained in effect until the breakup of Yugoslavia.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four independent chapters that study alternative Örmsílong run strategies in imperfectly competitive markets. The Örst chapter, "Comparative vs. Informative Advertising in Oligopolistic Markets", explores the Örmsíincentives to invest in informative and comparative advertising in oligopolistic markets with horizontally di§erentiated products. It is found that, in equilibrium the Örms optimally mix over advertising strategies, combining both informative and comparative advertising. Further, it is shown that the optimal advertising mix always favors the aggressive form of comparative advertising. The chapter also compares equilibrium market outcomes and social welfare under the endogenous advertising portfolio with the respective ones under no advertising, mere informative advertising and mere comparative advertising, and shows that they crucially depend on the intensity of market competition and the e¢ ciency of the advertising technology. The second chapter, "Comparative Advertising in Markets with Network Externalities", investigates the Örmsíincentives to invest in comparative advertising in a spatially di§erentiated duopoly market characterized by network externalities. It is found that Örms often have strong incentives to invest in comparative advertising, with their equilibrium investment levels to be positively related to transportation cost and negatively related to the intensity of network e§ects. More importantly, it is shown that the Örmsílocation distance (or else, their productsí di§erentiation) increases {{in the presence of}} network externalities and decreases in the presence of comparative advertising. The third chapter, "The Speed of Technological Adoption under Price Competition: Twotier vs. One-tier Industries", examines the Örmsí incentives to adopt a new cost reducing technology in vertically related markets, as well as, the e§ects of the vertical relations on the speed of the downstream Örmsíadoption of the new technology. It is found that, independently of the upstream market structure (i. e., upstream separate Örms or upstream monopoly), downstream Örms always have strong incentives to adopt the new technology. More importantly, it is shown that, independently of the upstream market structure, technology adoption may occur earlier in two-tier than in one-tier industries, depending on the intensity of the Önal market competition, the <b>drasticity</b> of the new technology on reducing the downstream Örmsímarginal cost of production and the bargaining power distribution in the market. Moreover, it is found that the Örst technology adoption takes place earlier under upstream monopoly than under upstream separated Örms, when the new technology is su¢ ciently drastic and the Önal market 2 competition is Öerce enough. The forth chapter, "Cournot is more Competitive than Bertrand! Upstream Monopoly with Two-part Tari§s", compares the equilibrium outcomes and social welfare under Cournot and Bertrand downstream competition when the upstream sector is monopolized by a single input provider and the vertical trade is conducted via two-part tari§s contracts. It is found that, in such a setting, a Cournot downstream market turns out to be more competitive than a Bertrand one. In addition, contrary to the conventional wisdom that suggests that Bertrand competition leads to higher social welfare than Cournot competition, it is shown that in vertically related markets with upstream monopolistic market structure and two-part tari§s trading contracts, consumersísurplus and social welfare are higher under Cournot than under Bertrand competition...|$|E
