The major activities currently being pursued by the Center for Seismology include, a) earthquake monitoring on 24X7 basis, including real time seismic monitoring for early warning of tsunamis, b) Operation and maintenance of national seismological network and local networks c) Seismological data centre and information services, d) Seismic hazard and risk related studies e) Field studies for aftershock / swarm monitoring, site response studies f) earthquake processes and modelling, etc.The MSK (Medvedev-Sponheuer-Karnik) intensity broadly associated with the various seismic zones is VI (or less), VII, VIII and IX (and above) for Zones 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively, corresponding to Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCE). The IS code follows a <b>dual</b> <b>design</b> philosophy: (a) under low probability or extreme earthquake events (MCE) the structure damage should not result in total collapse, and (b) under more frequently occurring earthquake events, the structure should suffer only minor or moderate structural damage. The specifications given in the design code (IS 1893: 2002) are not based on detailed assessment of maximum ground acceleration in each zone using a deterministic or probabilistic approach. Instead, each zone factor represents the effective period peak ground accelerations that may be generated during the maximum considered earthquake ground motion in that zone.|$|E
5000|$|The Fisher House uses form to {{separate}} the different programmatic uses of a home. The public and private are divided between two distinct two story nearly cubic volumes. Kahn can even be quoted saying that [...] "I always start with squares," [...] so the cubic nature of this project {{is not at all}} dissimilar to his other works of the period. The private volume is aligned along the north-south axis and the public, which is rotated exactly 45 degrees, is aligned along a northeast southwest line which runs parallel to the driveway. The public volume intersects the north face of the private with its southeast corner. The public space, which is perfectly square in plan, holds the entrance corridor and the master bedroom at ground level and two other bedrooms above. The second volume is slightly off square, having a rectangular plan, and holds the living, dining and kitchen space in a double height room. There is little distinction between the spaces dedicated to these three rooms and their differences from each other, encouraging a communal experience of the space. Throughout the house there are deeply recessed windows. These allow light in during winter and keep out direct light in summer. The recession of the windows provides further use than simply the circulation of light and air through the home. Kahn often used the windows indentations into the home to create occupiable spaces, such as benches, as well as storage spaces in the home such as closets and bookshelves. These uses were seen as very innovative at the time. The best example of these changes {{can be found in the}} main living area near the large hearth. Kahn created details out of the window ledge, and created not only a seating area, but also a set of selves for out of sight storage. The deep recession also allows them to be opened during storms without allowing rain to come into the house. There is a large stone hearth just off center in the living cube that creates a slight separation in the living room and the kitchen area, but the kitchen still opens more to the public realm that was traditionally the case at this time. The decision to create two distinct volumes was driven by the original <b>dual</b> <b>design</b> requirement of home and physician’s office. Though the office was dropped, the two volumes remain and serve well the need for privacy in a home.|$|E

This is made possible by its vast setting, {{and the way the}} Realms campaign [...] "avoids epic themes and theological frames", [...] "leaving room for the complex and contradictory jumble of pantheons and cultures encouraged by the AD&D game's developmental history". The Realms setting is a game setting, as opposed to a narrative setting like Krynn and Middle-earth, [...] "firmly rooted in the traditions of a decade of AD&D game campaigns and adventures, both published and [...] "house". Rolston disliked the [...] "DM's Sourcebook of the Realms"' handling of random encounters and its notes on dragons of the setting, and felt that its descriptions of NPCs are [...] "not particularly useful or appealing", with the exception of Elminster, [...] "an effective informant and presentation mouthpiece". The recent-news-and-rumors section was described as [...] "excellent, offering perfect examples of AD&D game-scale fantasy scenario ideas in a charming and flavorful style". He called the two dungeon adventures [...] "first-class", and described [...] "Halls of the Beast-Tamers" [...] as a [...] "classic AD&D game dungeon with lots of weirdness and magical flourishes" [...] which [...] "provides a solid rationale for the ever-popular monster-motel adventure", although he felt that it may be too tough for novices. [...] "Lashan's Fall" [...] was termed [...] "a nifty dungeon with a mystery", and said to feature [...] "a loony monster that may not necessarily rip into the PCs at the first opportunity". Rolston found in the [...] "Cyclopedia of the Realms" [...] book a [...] "less-satisfying treatment of gods and religion" [...] than that in books such as Deities & Demigods and Legends & Lore, as while [...] "the major archetypes and game elements are covered, there's little detail, motivation, or game information provided for the deities". He felt that the best entries in the encyclopedic section about places are several large- and medium-sized cities and towns, complete with maps and keys to the major establishments, and [...] "a good treatment of Shadowdale, a village proposed as the setting for novice campaigners". The strongest element of this encyclopedic section was considered to be the treatment of organizations such as the adventuring, mercenary, and merchant companies, which can be used as [...] "backdrops for intrigue and adventure, and provide background material for PC and NPC role-playing development. Skim through a couple of these entries; they're quite good." [...] Rolston felt that the maps were [...] "decent but unimpressive" [...] artistically, and graphically were [...] "exceptionally clear and useful", saying [...] "These ingenious devices are sure to please mappers and travel freaks". As a campaign setting, Rolston felt that the physical space of the Realms is vast and varied, and the important guiding themes of any campaign (good vs. evil, megavillains, depraved gods, quests, loot, power) [...] "are all available in profusion". He concluded that the setting was [...] "well-conceived as the official AD&D game campaign setting - vast enough to accommodate a multitude of house campaigns and variable playing styles, and true to the established traditions of a decade of AD&D game campaigning".|$|E

40|$|Against the {{background}} of increasing linguistic diversity in classrooms worldwide, we aimed to provide scientifically grounded insight into how language-oriented mathematics education can be designed, enacted and evaluated. We addressed the following main research question: How can teachers in multilingual primary classrooms scaffold pupils’ language required for mathematical learning? The first study addressed {{the question of how}} a teacher participating in <b>dual</b> <b>design</b> research learned to scaffold language required for mathematical learning. <b>Dual</b> <b>design</b> research is a special type of design research that aims to promote and trace the development of the pupils’ and the teacher’s learning. A case study involving one teacher and a multilingual upper primary classroom pointed at the teacher’s changes in knowledge and beliefs (e. g., concerning pupils’ hidden linguistic incompetence), changes in practice, and intentions for practice. We concluded that this learning process could be attributed to the characteristics of <b>dual</b> <b>design</b> research, that is its cyclic and interventionist character, the continuous process of prediction and reflection that lies at its heart, and the teacher’s co-designer’s role complemented with stimulated recall interviews. The second study addressed the language that is required for mathematical learning in the mathematical domain studied (line graphs). Drawing on genre pedagogy, we introduced the notion of pedagogical genre to refer to a genre that is deliberately designed for pedagogical purposes – in our case to support pupils’ reasoning about line graphs. The aim {{of the study was to}} summarize the development of the pedagogical genre and to evaluate what pupils learned from our approach that focused on promoting students’ proficiency in this pedagogical genre. We concluded that pupils progressed in deploying the pedagogical genre to a large extent. A multiple case study involving four pupils showed pupils’ gradual language development with some falling back over the course of the lessons. Cases where hypothetical and observed learning diverged reinforced the idea of a linguistic turn that we propose for educational design. The third and the fourth study respectively addressed the conceptual and methodological challenges of whole-class scaffolding. Referring to temporary and adaptive support, scaffolding has become widely used, also in whole-class settings. However, it has often been used in loose ways: key characteristics of scaffolding are often not clearly distinguished or scaffolding refers to any help. In response to these conceptual challenges we propose three key characteristics of whole-class scaffolding based on the scaffolding literature: diagnosis, responsiveness and handover to independence. These can be enacted both during and outside whole-class interaction, and they are distributed and cumulative over time. This conceptualisation brought along the methodological challenge of how to measure such long-term whole-class scaffolding. Therefore we investigated whether the enactment of strategies intended to scaffold the development of subject-specific language in a multilingual upper primary mathematics classroom did lead to whole-class scaffolding as identifiable by its key characteristics, taking into account the long-term nature. The empirical analyses indicated that this was indeed the case: The teacher diagnosed and responsively performed strategies over time, and she significantly handed over to linguistic independence...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new methodology for the optimization of supersonic airplane designs {{to meet the}} <b>dual</b> <b>design</b> objectives of low sonic boom and high aerodynamic performance. Two sets of design parameters are used on an existing High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) configuration to maximize the aerodynamic performance and minimize the sonic boom under the flight track.

A preliminary optimization run yielded a 3. 75 percent improvement in L/D over a baseline low-boom configuration. The other set of parameters modifies the fuselage area to achieve a target F-function. Starting from an initial configuration with strong bow, wing, and tail shocks, a modified design with a flat-top signature is obtained. The methods presented can easily incorporate other design variables and objective functions. Extensions to the present capability in progress are described...|$|E

Especially in the area of public-key-cryptography methods, which are based on elliptic curves (ECC), gain more and more importance. Compared to asymmetric algorithms, like RSA, ECC can be used with shorter key lengths, while achieving an equal level of security. The performance of ECC-algorithms can be increased significantly by adding application specific hardware extensions. Due to their fine grained parallelism, VLIW-processors are well suited for the execution of ECC algorithms. In this work, we extended the fourfold parallel CoreVA-VLIW-architecture by several hardware accelerators to increase the resource efficiency of the overall system. For the design-space exploration we use a <b>dual</b> <b>design</b> flow, which is based on the automatic generation of a complete C-compiler based tool chain from a central processor specification.

Tailorable technologies support user goals, intentions, metaphor, and use patterns in the selection and integration of technology functions in the creation of new and unique information systems. We propose a theory of tailorable technology design and identify principles necessary for the initial design. Following a Kantian style of inquiry, we identified four definitional characteristics of tailorable technology: a <b>dual</b> <b>design</b> perspective, user engagement, recognizable environments, and component architectures. From these characteristics, we propose nine design principles that will support the phenomenon of tailoring. Through a year-long case study, we refined and evidenced the principles, finding found that designers of tailorable technologies build environments in which users can both interact and engage with the technology, supporting the proposed design principles. The findings highlight a distinction between a reflective environment, where users recognize and imagine uses for the technology, and an active environment in which users tailor the technology in accordance with the imagined uses.

40|$|When {{completing}} {{tasks in}} complex, dynamic domains individuals must consider both high-level issues (e. g [...] relationships among several variables) and low-level data (e. g., {{the values of}} individual variables). An important issue in display design is to determine those graphic forms that allow the efficicnt extraction of information at both levels. One display {{that has the potential}} to achieve these <b>dual</b> <b>design</b> goals is the configural (object) display. Research on configural displays has indicated that this type of display will facilitate the extraction of information about high-level issues if the emergent features directly correspond to the critical data relationships that exist in a domain. On the other hand, designing configural displays to offset the cost that is usually associated with the extraction of low-level data has proven to be more difficult. One potential design strategy to accomplish this is to increase the perceptual salience of the lower-level display elements and color-coding is one technique to acheive this. Performance for color-coded configural and separate displays was compared in two empirical investigations. For the extraction of information regarding high-level issues the configural display significantly increased accuracy with no cost in latency. For the extraction of low-level data there were no differences between the configural and separate display for accuracy, but there was a significant decrement in latency associated with the configural display. However, the results indicate that this decrement in performance dissipates with experience, and under certain conditions was not significant...|$|E

Human emotions, both beneficial (positive emotional labor) and harmful (negative emotional labor), have received short shrift in leadership development, supervision, direct practice preparation and supports, and workforce stabilization, and professionalization. Significantly, a key indicator of negative emotional labor—secondary traumatic stress (STS) —often has been ignored and neglected, {{despite the fact}} that it may be endemic in the workforce. STS typically results from traumatic events in practice, but it also stems from workplace violence. Often undetected and untreated, STS is at least a hidden correlate and perhaps a probable cause of myriad problems such as questionable practice with families, life-work conflicts, undesirable workforce turnover, and a sub-optimal organizational climate. Special interventions are needed. At the same time, new organizational designs are needed to promote and reinforce positive emotional labor. Arguably, positive emotional labor and the positive organizational climates it facilitates are requisites for harmonious relations between jobs and personal lives, desirable workforce retention, and better outcomes for children and families.
