40|$|A {{survey is}} {{presented}} {{of the architecture}} of secondary wall <b>ingrowths</b> in transfer cells from various taxa based on scanning electron microscopy. Wall <b>ingrowths</b> are a distinguishing feature of transfer cells and serve to amplify the plasma membrane surface area available for solute transport. Morphologically, two categories of <b>ingrowths</b> are recognized: reticulate and flange. Reticulate-type wall <b>ingrowths</b> are characterized by the deposition of small papillae that emerge from the underlying wall at discrete but apparently random loci, then branch and interconnect to form a complex labyrinth of variable morphology. In comparison, flange-type <b>ingrowths</b> are deposited as curvilinear ribs of wall material that remain {{in contact with the}} underlying wall along their length and become variously elaborate in different transfer cell types. This paper discusses the morphology of different types of wall <b>ingrowths</b> in relation to existing models for deposition of other secondary cell walls...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of wall <b>ingrowths</b> increases plasma membrane surface areas of transfer cells involved in membrane transport of nutrients in plants. Construction of these <b>ingrowths</b> provides intriguing and diverse examples of localized wall deposition. Flange wall <b>ingrowths</b> resemble secondary wall thickenings of tracheary elements in morphology and probable mechanisms of deposition. By contrast, reticulate wall <b>ingrowths,</b> deposited as discrete papillate projections, branch and fuse {{to create a}} fenestrated wall labyrinth representing a novel form of localized wall deposition. Papillate wall <b>ingrowths</b> are initiated as patches of disorganized cellulosic material and are compositionally similar to primary walls, except for a surrounding layer of callose and enhanced levels of arabinogalactan proteins at the ingrowth/membrane interface. How this unusual form of localized wall deposition is constructed is unknown but may involve constraining cellulose-synthesizing rosette complexes at their growing tips...|$|R
30|$|In {{flowering}} plants, the suspensor {{can take}} on structural and biochemical specializations (Yeung and Meinke 1993; Kawashima and Goldberg 2010). Transfer cell morphology {{is one of the}} common structural specializations observed in suspensor cells. In Paphiopedilum delenatii, wall <b>ingrowths</b> are found in suspensor cells (Lee et al. 2006). Wall <b>ingrowths</b> increase the surface area of a cell which can aid in short distance transport. Hence, the formation of wall <b>ingrowths</b> further strengthens the notion that orchid suspensor is specialized in nutrient uptake. The membrane associated with wall <b>ingrowths</b> is unique, e.g. with a higher density of proton pumps (Bouché-Pillon et al. 1994). Future studies demonstrating the presence of biochemical specialization(s) will serve as proof of orchid suspensor function.|$|R

40|$|The {{companion}} cells (CCs) and/or {{phloem parenchyma}} cells (PCs) in foliar minor veins of some species exhibit invaginations that are amplified when plants develop in high light (HL) compared to low light (LL). Leaves {{of plants that}} develop under HL also exhibit greater maximal rates of photosynthesis compared to those that develop under LL, suggesting that the increased membrane area of CCs and PCs of HL-acclimated leaves may provide for greater levels of transport proteins facilitating enhanced sugar export. Furthermore, the degree of wall invagination in PCs (Arabidopsis thaliana) or CCs (pea) of fully expanded LL-acclimated leaves increased to {{the same level as}} that present in HL-acclimated leaves 7 days following transfer to HL, and maximal photosynthesis rates of transferred leaves of both species likewise increased to the same level as in HL-acclimated leaves. In contrast, transfer of Senecio vulgaris from LL to HL resulted in increased wall invagination in CCs, but not PCs, and such leaves furthermore exhibited only partial upregulation of photosynthetic capacity following LL to HL transfer. Moreover, a significant linear relationship existed between the level of cell wall <b>ingrowths</b> and maximal photosynthesis rates across all three species and growth light regimes. A positive linear relationship between these two parameters was also present for two ecotypes (Sweden, Italy) of the winter annual A. thaliana in response to growth at different temperatures, with significantly greater levels of PC wall <b>ingrowths</b> and higher rates of photosynthesis in leaves that developed at cooler versus warmer temperatures. Treatment of LL-acclimated plants with the stress hormone methyl jasmonate also resulted in increased levels of wall <b>ingrowths</b> in PCs of A. thaliana and S. vulgaris but not in CCs of pea and S. vulgaris. The possible role of PC wall <b>ingrowths</b> in sugar export versus as physical barriers to the movement of pathogens warrants further attention...|$|R
25|$|In {{hydroxyapatite}} implants {{a secondary}} procedure can insert an externalized, round-headed peg or screw into the implant. The prosthesis {{is modified to}} accommodate the peg, creating a ball-and-socket joint: after fibrovascular <b>ingrowth</b> is completed, a small hole can be drilled into the anterior surface of the implant. After conjunctivalization of this hole, it can be fitted with a peg with a rounded top that ﬁts into a corresponding dimple at the posterior surface of the artiﬁcial eye.

25|$|Self-assembly {{may play}} an {{important}} role here, both from the perspective of encapsulating cells and proteins, as well as creating scaffolds on the right physical scale for engineered tissue constructs and cellular <b>ingrowth.</b> The micromasonry is a prime technology to get cells grown in a lab to assemble into three-dimensional shapes. To break down tissue into single-cell building blocks, researchers have to dissolve the extracellular mortar that normally binds them together. But once that glue is removed, it's quite difficult to get cells to reassemble into the complex structures that make up our natural tissues. While cells aren't easily stackable, building blocks are. So the micromasonry starts with the encapsulation of living cells in polymer cubes. From there, the blocks self-assemble in any shape using templates.|$|E
25|$|One study {{compared}} {{patients with}} ingrown toenails to healthy controls {{and found no}} difference in the shape of toenails between those of patients and of the control group. The study suggested that treatment should not be based on the correction of a non-existent nail deformity. Ingrown toenails are caused by weight-bearing (activities such as walking, running, etc.) in patients that have too much soft skin tissue on the sides of their nail. Weight bearing causes this excessive amount of skin to bulge up along the sides of the nail. The pressure on the skin around the nail results in the tissue being damaged, resulting in swelling, redness and infection. Many treatments are directed at the nail itself and often include partial or full removal of the healthy nail. However, failure to treat the cutaneous condition can result in a return of the <b>ingrowth</b> and a deformity or mutilation of the nail.|$|E
40|$|Transfer {{cells are}} plant cells with {{secondary}} wall <b>ingrowths.</b> These cells are ubiquitous, occurring in all plant taxonomic groups and in algae and fungi. Transfer cells form from differentiated cells across developmental windows {{and in response}} to stress. They are considered to {{play a central role in}} nutrient distribution by facilitating high rates of transport at bottlenecks for apo-/symplasmic solute exchange. These properties are conferred by their unique structural features—an invaginated secondary wall ensheathed by an amplified area of plasma membrane enriched in a suite of solute transporters. Recent development of transfer cell experimental systems, combined with technologies to image the three-dimensional structure of wall <b>ingrowths,</b> is allowing identification of inductive and regulatory signals, discovery of sequential processes involved in their differentiation, and a search for transfer cell identity genes.

40|$|The {{events that}} {{accompany}} sporogenesis in the apogamous fern Dryopteris borreri parallel those seen in sexually reproducing ferns. Organelles dedifferentiate and redifferentiate, {{and form a}} discrete band across the equator of dyads; nuclear vacuoles and lipid spherosomes appear during prophase, and the {{major part of the}} ribosome population is removed and subsequently replaced during meiosis. Similar events have been found to occur during sporogenesis in mosses, gymno-sperms and angiosperms, and are therefore characteristic of the meiotic transition from sporophyte to gametophyte, {{even in the absence of}} a transition from diplophase to haplophase. The novel aspects of meiosis in D. borreri are largely those connected with the restitution event that precedes meiosis 1 and serves to maintain the sporophytic chromosome number throughout the life cycle of this fern. Pre-meiotic cells are regularly found to be cleaved by annular wall <b>ingrowths,</b> which traverse the cytoplasm but not the nuclei.

25|$|Hyaluronic acid (HA) is {{a widely}} used {{biomaterial}} {{as a result of}} its excellent biocompatibility and its physiologic function diversity. It is abundant in the extracellular matrix (ECM) where it binds large glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans through specific HA-protein interactions. HA also binds cell surface receptors such as CD44, which results in the activation of intracellular signaling cascades that regulate cell adhesion and motility and promote proliferation and differentiation. HA is also known to support angiogenesis because its degradation products stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Thus, HA plays a pivotal role in maintaining the normal processes necessary for tissue survival. Unmodified HA has been used in clinical applications such as ocular surgery, wound healing, and plastic surgery. HA can be crosslinked to form hydrogels. HA hydrogels that were either unmodified or modified with laminin were implanted into an adult central nervous system lesion and tested for their ability to induce neural tissue formation in a study by Hou et al.. They demonstrated the ability to support cell <b>ingrowth</b> and angiogenesis, in addition to inhibiting glial scar formation. Also, the HA hydrogels modified with laminin were able to promote neurite extension. These results support HA gels as a promising biomaterial for a nerve guidance conduit.|$|E

40|$|The cyst {{nematode}} Heterodera schachtii infects roots of Arabidopsis plants and establishes feeding sites called syncytia, {{which are the}} only nutrient source for nematodes. Development of syncytia is accompanied by changes in cell wall structures including the development of cell wall <b>ingrowths.</b> UDP-glucuronic acid is a precursor of several cell wall polysaccharides and can be produced by UDP-glucose dehydrogenase through oxidation of UDP-glucose. Four genes in Arabidopsis encode this enzyme. Promoter::GUS analysis revealed that UGD 2 and UGD 3 were expressed in syncytia as early as 1 dpi while expression of UGD 1 and UGD 4 could only be detected starting at 2 dpi. Infection assays showed no differences between Dugd 1 and Dugd 4 single mutants and wild type plants concerning numbers {{of males and females}} and the size of syncytia and cysts. On single mutants of Dugd 2 and Dugd 3, however, less and smaller females, and smaller syncytia formed compared to wild type plants. The double mutant DDugd 23 had a stronger effect than the single mutants. These data indicate that UGD 2 and UGD 3 but not UGD 1 and UGD 4 are important for syncytium development. We therefore studied the ultrastructure of syncytia in the DDugd 23 double mutant. Syncytia contained an electron translucent cytoplasm with degenerated cellular organelles and numerous small vacuoles instead of the dense cytoplasm as in syncytia developing in wild type roots. Typical cell wall <b>ingrowths</b> were missing in the DDugd 23 double mutant. Therefore we conclude that UGD 2 and UGD 3 are needed for the production of cell wall <b>ingrowths</b> in syncytia and that their lack leads to a reduced hos...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Transfer {{cells are}} highly {{specialized}} plant cells in which cell wall <b>ingrowths</b> increase {{the surface area}} of plasma membrane, and abundant mitochondria provide high levels of energy for facilitated membrane transport. Number of studies using light and electron microscopes reported that transfer cells exist in most economically important crops and developed from many types of plant cells. Several lines of physiological and cell biological research suggest that transfer cells may play significant roles on nutrients uptake (especially under deficiency condition) and assimilate transport. It appears that many plants have the genetic competence to develop transfer cells to enhance their capacity for transport of sugars, amino acids and metal ions. However, very {{little is known about}} the molecular components and their underlying mechanism(s) involved in transfer cell develop and functioning. Using contemporary functional genomics tools, we are identifying the genes expressed in wheat nucellar projection transfer cells, and will continue to explore the molecular mechanism(s) governing transfer cell development and function.

2500|$|The {{most common}} digit to become ingrown {{is the big}} toe, but <b>ingrowth</b> can occur on any nail. Ingrown nails can be avoided by cutting nails {{straight}} across; not along a curve, not too short and no shorter than the flesh around it. Footwear that is too small or too narrow, or with too shallow of a [...] "toe box", will exacerbate any underlying problem with a toenail. Sharp square corners may be uncomfortable and cause snagging on socks. Proper cutting leaves {{the leading edge of}} the nail free of the flesh, precluding it from growing into the toe. Filing of the corner is reasonable. Some nails require cutting of the corners far back to remove edges that dig into the flesh; this is often done as a partial wedge resection by a podiatrist. Ingrown toe nails can be caused by injury, commonly blunt trauma in which the flesh is pressed against the nail causing a small cut that swells. Injury to the nail can cause it to grow abnormally, making it wider or thicker than normal, or even bulged or crooked.|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims Transfer {{cells are}} plant cells {{specialized}} in apoplast/symplast transport and {{characterized by a}} distinctive wall labyrinth apparatus. The molecular architecture and biochemistry of the labyrinth apparatus are poorly known. The leaf lamina in the aquatic angiosperm Elodea canadensis consists of only two cell layers, with the abaxial cells developing as transfer cells. The present study investigated biochemical properties of wall <b>ingrowths</b> and associated plasmalemma in these cells. † Methods Leaves of Elodea were examined by light and electron microscopy and ATPase activity was localized cytochemically. Immunogold electron microscopy was employed to localize carbohydrate epitopes associated with major cell wall polysaccharides and glycoproteins. † Key Results The plasmalemma associated with the wall labyrinth is strongly enriched in light-dependent ATPase activity. The wall <b>ingrowths</b> and an underlying wall layer share an LM 11 epitope probably associated with glucuronoarabinoxylan and a CCRC-M 7 epitope typically associated with rhamnogalacturonan I. No labelling was observed with LM 10, an antibody that recognizes low-substituted and unsubstituted xylan, a polysaccharide consistently associated with secondary cell walls. The JIM 5 and JIM 7 epitopes, associated with homogalacturonan with different degrees of methylation, appear to be absent in the wall labyrinth but present {{in the rest of}} cell walls. †Conclusions The wall labyrinth apparatus of leaf transfer cells in Elodea is a specialized structure with distinctive biochemical properties. The high level of light-dependent ATPase activity in the plasmalemma lining the wall labyrinth is consistent with a formerly suggested role of leaf transfer cells in enhancing inorganic carbon inflow. The wall labyrinth {{is a part of the}} primary cell wall. The discovery that the wall <b>ingrowths</b> in Elodea have an antibody-binding pattern divergent, in part, from that of the rest of cell wall suggests that their carbohydrate composition is modulated in relation to transfer cell functioning...|$|R
40|$|In maize, the {{endosperm}} region {{next to the}} placento-chalaza is characterised by {{the presence}} of cells with extensive cell wall <b>ingrowths</b> (transfer cells). Specific genes, collectively named as BETL (for Basal Endosperm Transfer Layer) genes, are expressed in these cells in a way that coincides with the temporal development of the transfer cell layer. The BETL- 1 gene encodes a polypeptide of 7 kDa, exclusively expressed in the transfer cell region and possibly involved {{in the construction of the}} cell wall. However, the sequence (defensin- like) is also consistent with an antipathogenic role. We found that BETL- 1 is strongly associated with the cell wall <b>ingrowths</b> of the endosperm transfer layer. On the other hand, BETL- 2 (an antifungal protein) is not bound to the cell wall of transfer cells. The two BETL- 2 forms (the 8 kDa propeptide and the final 4. 5 kDa peptide) are detected in different subcellular compartments. The propeptide is mostly associated with the membrane fraction of endosperm, while the low molecular weight form is soluble. Vesicles containing the 8 -kDa BETL- 2 propeptide are located in association with microtubules present in the transfer cell region. Together with previous evidence on the differential distribution of the BETL- 2 forms, these data outline the processing pathway of BETL- 2, from synthesis in the transfer cells to the site of utilisation in the placento-chalaza region. BETL- 4 (which is weakly related to a family of protease inhibitors) is mainly found in the transfer cell layer, and is absent from adjacent regions. Unlike BETL- 1, BETL- 4 is not a cell wall protein, even though it is associated with the <b>ingrowths</b> of the transfer cell walls. Therefore, BETL proteins show distinct properties of localisation and distribution, which are related to their differential functions in the transfer cells...|$|R
