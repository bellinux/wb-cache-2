5|$|<b>Earnings</b> {{management}} {{involves the}} manipulation of company <b>earnings</b> towards a pre-determined target. This target can be motivated by a preference for more stable <b>earnings,</b> in which case management {{is said to be}} carrying out income smoothing. Opportunistic income smoothing can in turn signal lower risk and increase a firm's market value. Other possible motivations for <b>earnings</b> management include the need to maintain the levels of certain accounting ratios due to debt covenants, and the pressure to maintain increasing <b>earnings</b> and to beat analyst targets.|$|E

5|$|<b>Earnings</b> {{management}} {{may involve}} exploiting {{opportunities to make}} accounting decisions that change the <b>earnings</b> figure reported on the financial statements. Accounting decisions can in turn affect <b>earnings</b> because they can influence the timing of transactions and the estimates used in financial reporting. For example, a comparatively small change in the estimates for uncollectible accounts can {{have a significant effect}} on net income, and a company using last-in, first-out accounting for inventories can increase net income in times of rising prices by delaying purchases to future periods.|$|E

The {{value of the}} stock {{continued}} to grow steadily and by 1996, shares were trading at $2,300 per share; and hitting as high as $3,600 a share in 2003. Though not required to provide U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, the company does distribute similar-style reports to its shareholders annually, and in the 1930s and 40s, its annual <b>earnings</b> were reported in the Christian Science Monitor.

5|$|MTV {{estimated}} {{that by the}} end of 2014, Beyoncé would become the highest-paid black musician in history; this became the case in April 2014. In June 2014, Beyoncé ranked at number one on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, earning an estimated $115million throughout June 2013 – June 2014. This in turn was the first time she had topped the Celebrity 100 list as well as being her highest yearly <b>earnings</b> to date. In 2016, Beyoncé ranked at number 34 on the Celebrity 100 list with <b>earnings</b> of $54 million. Herself and Jay-Z also topped the highest paid celebrity couple list, with combined <b>earnings</b> of $107.5 million.

This tied Beyoncé with Madonna as the only two female artists to earn more than $100 million within a single year twice. As a couple with Jay-Z, they have a combined net worth of $1.16 billion. In July 2017, Billboard announced that Beyoncé was the highest paid musician of 2016, with an estimated total of $62.1 million.|$|E
5|$|Meet the Parents had its {{theatrical}} {{release in}} United States and Canada on October 6, 2000. Distributed domestically by Universal Studios, the film had an advertising budget of $33.9 million. It quickly {{proved to be}} a financial success taking in $28.6 million during its opening weekend and averaging $10,950 per theater in a total of 2,614 theaters. It finished as the top earning film for the weekend of October 6–8 beating the second placer Remember the Titans by a margin of over $9 million and bringing in more than four times the <b>earnings</b> of Get Carter, the next highest earning film released that same weekend. The film's opening weekend <b>earnings</b> were the highest ever for any film released in the month of October as well as marking the highest opening weekend <b>earnings</b> for a film starring Robert De Niro. The film's <b>earnings</b> for the second week of release dropped by 26% down to $21.1 million, which still kept the film at No.1 at the box office beating Remember the Titans by a margin of over $8 million. By {{the end of the second}} week of release, the film had already grossed over $58 million, surpassing its production budget of $55 million.|$|E
5|$|The film premiered on 9 December 1965 in Tokyo {{and opened}} on 29 December 1965 in the UK. It {{was a major}} success {{at the box office}} with record-breaking <b>earnings.</b> Variety {{reported}} that Thunderball was the number-one money maker of 1966 at the North American box office by a large margin, with a net profit of $26,500,000. The second-highest money maker of 1966 was Doctor Zhivago at $15,000,000; in third place was Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? at $10,300,000. It eventually grossed $63.6 million in the United States, equating to roughly 58.1 million admissions. In total, the film has earned $141.2 million worldwide, surpassing the <b>earnings</b> of the three preceding films in the series—easily recouping its $9 million budget—and remained the highest-grossing Bond film until Live and Let Die (1973) assumed the record. After adjusting its <b>earnings</b> to 2011 prices, it has made around $1 billion, making it the second-most financially successful Bond film after Skyfall.|$|E

25|$|An <b>earnings</b> surprise, or {{unexpected}} <b>earnings,</b> in accounting, is {{the difference}} between the reported <b>earnings</b> and the expected <b>earnings</b> of an entity. Measures of a firm's expected <b>earnings,</b> in turn, include analysts' forecasts of the firm's profit and mathematical models of expected <b>earnings</b> based on the <b>earnings</b> of previous accounting periods.|$|E
25|$|Stock markets tend {{to react}} {{in the same}} {{direction}} as <b>earnings</b> surprises—positively to positive <b>earnings</b> surprises and negatively to negative <b>earnings</b> surprises—although a significant proportion of <b>earnings</b> surprises result in stock markets reacting in the opposite direction, which may be a reaction to other relevant information released with the <b>earnings</b> announcement or inaccurate measurement of the <b>earnings</b> surprise.|$|E
25|$|Large {{negative}} <b>earnings</b> surprises {{may have}} legal and reputational costs to managers. Firstly, managers {{can be held}} personally liable if shareholders sue the firm for failing to disclose negative <b>earnings</b> news promptly. Secondly, money managers may choose not to hold, and analysts may choose not to follow, the stocks of firms whose managers have reputations for withholding bad news. This may contribute to managers' voluntary disclosure of information related to negative <b>earnings</b> surprises: quarterly <b>earnings</b> announcements containing large negative <b>earnings</b> surprises are preempted by voluntary disclosures more frequently than are other <b>earnings</b> announcements.|$|E
25|$|<b>Earnings</b> surprises can be {{measured}} using historical <b>earnings</b> or analysts' forecasts.|$|E

Construction was the industry with the smallest gender pay gap, with women earning 92.2% of what men earned.|$|E
25|$|The market, however, may not {{correctly}} {{estimate the}} implications of <b>earnings</b> surprises when it revises its expectations of future <b>earnings,</b> which will decrease the change in stock prices associated with the change in <b>earnings.</b> In fact, many studies in accounting research have documented that the market takes {{up to a year}} to adjust to <b>earnings</b> announcements, a phenomenon known as the post-earnings announcement drift.|$|E

25|$|SERPS {{ran from}} 6 April 1978 to 5 April 2002. As the name implies, {{the level of}} pension payable was related to <b>earnings</b> via the amount of National Insurance contributions. Qualification was based on band <b>earnings</b> above a Lower <b>Earnings</b> Limit (LEL) in each year. The LEL (£84 per week /£4368 pa in 2006/07) was usually set {{at the same level}} as the BSP (£84.25) and {{increased}} when BSP did. Band <b>earnings</b> were those between the LEL and an Upper <b>Earnings</b> Limit (UEL) at which National Insurance contributions ceased to be payable by the employee (this was £645 per week/£2,795 per month in 2006/07, although the UEL now refers to a threshold where reduced NI payments are made, as opposed to payment ceasing).
