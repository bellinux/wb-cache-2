5|$|Tierney first ran <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> 1994 against one-term Republican {{incumbent}} Peter G. Torkildsen, {{having won}} a competitive Democratic primary with {{a plurality of}} 33.8 percent. He ran on a platform promoting a stronger federal focus on drug abuse, federal aid to promote after-school programs, consideration of means testing for Social Security, and single-payer health care. A primary issue in the campaign was crime: Tierney criticized Torkildsen for his vote against a 1994 crime bill, and advocated stronger gun control, while Torkildsen criticized Tierney's positions on gun control and drug legalization. Tierney was defeated {{in the general election}} by 4%. Tierney successfully ran <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> 1996, defeating Torkildsen by a narrow margin and increasing his margin in a 1998 rematch. Over the next five elections, Tierney won with over 68% of the vote. In 2010, he faced a stronger challenge from Republican candidate Bill Hudak, after his wife Patrice was convicted of felony tax fraud; he won with 57% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Beginning as a supporter, Greeley {{soon became}} disillusioned with President Johnson, whose Reconstruction {{policies}} allowed the quick formation of state governments without provision for suffrage for the freedman. When Congress convened and gradually {{took control of}} Reconstruction, Greeley generally supported their actions, favoring universal male suffrage and, his anger against the Confederates having cooled, amnesty. While Greeley generally supported the Radical Republicans, {{he did not like}} the harshness of Thaddeus Stevens. Greeley ran <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> 1866, but lost badly, and for Senate in the legislative election held in early 1867, to be defeated by Roscoe Conkling.|$|E
50|$|As was {{the case}} for many rank-and-file party members of the day, Wagenknecht was a regular {{candidate}} for public office on the Socialist ticket, running <b>for</b> US <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> 1906, <b>for</b> Seattle Comptroller <b>in</b> 1908, and <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> again <b>in</b> 1912 when the party's first choice, John Wanhope, stepped aside.|$|R

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Worcester, Massachusetts, McGovern {{attended}} Worcester Academy. While in college {{he worked as a}} congressional aide to U.S. Senator George McGovern (to whom he has no relation), a two-time presidential candidate for whom he campaigned. From 1981 to 1996 he was a senior staff member for U.S. Representative Joe Moakley. McGovern first ran <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> 1994, where he lost in the Democratic primary. He ran again in 1996, defeating Republican incumbent Peter Blute. He has been reelected every two years since then without serious difficulty.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} 16, Booth was {{interested}} in the theatre and in politics, and he became a delegate from Bel Air to a rally by the Know Nothing Party for Henry Winter Davis, the anti-immigrant party's candidate <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> the 1854 elections. Booth aspired to {{follow in the footsteps of}} his father and his actor brothers Edwin and Junius Brutus, Jr. He began practicing elocution daily in the woods around Tudor Hall and studying Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{himself as}} the heir to Chibás, Castro wanted to run <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> the June 1952 elections. Senior Ortodoxo members feared his radical {{reputation}} and refused to nominate him; instead he was nominated {{as a candidate for}} the House of Representatives by party members in Havana's poorest districts, and began campaigning. The Ortodoxo gained a considerable level of support and was predicted to do well in the election.|$|E

5|$|After a {{bruising}} primary {{battle with}} another incumbent whose district was combined with his, in which McEwen faced charges of bouncing checks on the House bank, he narrowly lost the 1992 general election to Democrat Ted Strickland. Following an unsuccessful {{run in the}} adjacent Second District in 1993, McEwen was largely absent from the Ohio political scene for a decade, until in 2005 he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> the Second District special election to replace Rob Portman, who beat him in 1993, and finished second to the winner in the general election, Jean Schmidt. McEwen's 2005 platform was familiar from his past campaigns, advocating a pro-life stance, defending Second Amendment rights, and promising to limit taxes and government spending. In 2006, he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination in the Second District.|$|E
5|$|Castro co-founded a legal {{partnership}} that primarily catered for poor Cubans, although it proved a financial failure. Caring little for money or material goods, Castro {{failed to pay}} his bills; his furniture was repossessed and electricity cut off, distressing his wife. He {{took part in a}} high-school protest in Cienfuegos in November 1950, fighting with police in protest at the Education Ministry's ban on student associations; arrested and charged for violent conduct, the magistrate dismissed the charges. His hopes for Cuba still centered on Chibás and the Partido Ortodoxo, and he was present at Chibás' politically motivated suicide in 1951. Seeing himself as Chibás' heir, Castro wanted to run <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> the June 1952 elections, though senior Ortodoxo members feared his radical reputation and refused to nominate him. Instead he was nominated as a candidate for the House of Representatives by party members in Havana's poorest districts, and began campaigning. The Ortodoxo had considerable support and was predicted to do well in the election.|$|E
5|$|Mount ran <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> 2004 {{to succeed}} Chris John, who instead {{ran for the}} United States Senate but lost to Republican David Vitter. She {{positioned}} herself as a Conservative Democrat who supported balanced budgets and conservative social views, emphasizing job creation, health care and her opposition to offshoring. Her major Democratic opponent in the jungle primary was African American State Senator Don Cravins, Sr., the father of another lawmaker, Don Cravins, Jr., of Opelousas. Her major Republican opponent was Charles Boustany, a retired heart surgeon from Lafayette, who ran {{on a platform of}} preventing tax increases and passing a new energy bill. The Louisiana Democratic Party was supporting Mount, as Cravins was believed to be a weaker contestant in a run-off. Polls taken in late October had shown Boustany, Cravins and Mount statistically tied, and the election was hotly contested.|$|E

5|$|Sherman was renominated <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> 1860 and {{was active}} in Abraham Lincoln's {{campaign}} for President, giving speeches on his behalf in several states. Both were elected, with Sherman defeating his opponent, Barnabas Burns, by 2,864 votes. He returned to Washington for the lame duck session of the 36th Congress. By February 1861, seven states had reacted to Lincoln's election by seceding from the Union. In response, Congress passed a constitutional amendment proposed by Representative Thomas Corwin of Ohio. Known today as the Corwin Amendment, it {{was an attempt to}} forge a compromise to keep the remaining slave states in the Union and entice the seceded states to return. Corwin's legislation would have preserved the status quo on slavery and prohibited any future amendment granting Congress power to interfere with slavery in the states. Sherman voted for the amendment, which passed both houses of Congress and was sent to the states for ratification. Few states ratified it, and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, outlawing slavery, rendered the compromise measure moot.|$|E
5|$|The {{new state}} {{legislature}} had also appointed a five-man committee {{to select a}} city {{to be the new}} state capital. Scott applied to have Petersburg, still a fledgling settlement, designated as the capital. Other localities– including Frankfort, Lexington, Louisville, and Boonesborough– also applied. Frankfort was eventually chosen, as Scott's failure to secure Petersburg's designation as the state capital contributed more than anything else to the settlement's failure to even become a viable city. Scott's son, Charles, Jr., wrote to his brother Daniel that their father was planning to run <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> 1792; although Charles, Jr. expressed confidence that his father would be elected, his campaign apparently never materialized or faltered shortly after it began. He was, however, chosen as a presidential elector in 1793.|$|E
5|$|When Minton {{returned}} home he reopened his law practice {{and decided to}} enter politics. He ran for office in Indiana's 3rd congressional district, but lost the Democratic primary, despite significant campaigning and his war record. He lost to John Ewing, 6,502 votes to 3,170, second place {{in a field of}} five candidates. After the loss, he briefly joined the Indiana law firm of Stonsenburg and Weathers, two politically active lawyers, before moving to Miami, Florida, where he joined another firm, Shutts & Bowen. In January 1928, he left the Miami practice and returned to Stonsenburg and Weathers. He attempted to secure the Democratic nomination to run <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> 1930, but was again defeated, this time by the former state party chairman Eugene B. Crowe.|$|E

5|$|While {{president}} of Congress, Hancock {{became involved in}} a long-running controversy with Harvard. As treasurer of the college since 1773, he had been entrusted with the school's financial records and about £15,000 in cash and securities. In the rush of events {{at the onset of}} the Revolutionary War, Hancock had been unable to return the money and accounts to Harvard before leaving <b>for</b> <b>Congress.</b> <b>In</b> 1777, a Harvard committee headed by James Bowdoin, Hancock's chief political and social rival in Boston, sent a messenger to Philadelphia to retrieve the money and records. Hancock was offended, but he turned over more than £16,000, though not all of the records, to the college. When Harvard replaced Hancock as treasurer, his ego was bruised, and for years he declined to settle the account or pay the interest on the money he had held, despite pressure put on him by Bowdoin and other political opponents. The issue dragged on until after Hancock's death, when his estate finally paid the college more than £1,000 to resolve the matter.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} session in Congress, Jennings {{had a small}} {{portrait}} of himself made, which he later gave to Ann Gilmore Hay, {{the daughter of a}} prominent Charlestown politician, whom he had recently begun courting. Hay was born in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, in 1792. Her family moved to Clark County in Indiana Territory, and settled in Charlestown. Jennings first met her when he was campaigning <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> 1809. After his first session in Congress ended, Jennings returned to Indiana Territory and married eighteen-year-old Ann on August 8, 1811. Ann's father had just died leaving her with no family or means of support. Following his reelection to Congress in 1811, the couple returned to Washington, where she remained briefly, before traveling to Pennsylvania to live with Jennings's sister, Ann Mitchell, {{for the remainder of the}} session. Jennings's wife suffered from ill health, which deteriorated after he became governor of Indiana in 1816, and she died after a protected illness in 1826. Later that year Jennings married Clarissa Barbee, who had come from Kentucky to teach at the Charlestown seminary. Jennings had no children from either marriage.|$|E
