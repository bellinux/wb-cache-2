It explores the current state and main characteristics, contributions, problems and barriers of private cross-sectoral partnership. Furthermore the relations between the environmental organizations' characteristics and specific aspects of cooperation are examined. In the end the results of the survey are set into the context of three-partnership-generations theory and the basic explanation of private environmental cross-sectoral partnership's current state is discussed in the context of specific features of Czech society...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between firms cooperation and their propensity toward environmental innovation. Previous literature has emphasized the peculiarities of such innovations based on their drivers, their positive spill-overs {{and the importance of}} regulation to trigger them. This paper contributes to the literature by focusing on the importance of cooperation and of vertical, horizontal and lateral cooperative agreements on environmental innovation propensity. I test these hypotheses through a large scale dataset, the Community Innovation Survey for Spanish firms (PITEC), through the use of estimation techniques that allow to control for possible selection bias. The econometric estimations suggest that environmental innovative firms cooperate on innovation to an higher extent than other innovative firms. Furthermore, cooperation with suppliers, KIBS and universities is more relevant than for other innovative firms, whereas cooperation with clients {{does not seem to be}} differentially important. <b>environmental</b> innovation, <b>cooperation,</b> R&D, two step logit model, innovation survey. ...|$|R
