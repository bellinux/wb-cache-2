40|$|We {{present a}} {{measurement}} of the polarization- temperature angular cross power spectra, and, of the cosmic microwave background. The result is based on similar to 200 hr of data from eight polarization- sensitive bolometers operating at 145 GHz during the 2003 flight of BOOMERANG. We detect a significant correlation in <b>the</b> <b>l-range</b> between 50 and 950 with a statistical significance of > 3. 5 sigma. Contamination by polarized foreground emission and systematic effects are negligible in comparison with statistical uncertainties. The spectrum {{is consistent with previous}} detections and with the ``concordance model'' that assumes adiabatic initial conditions. This is the first measurement of polarization- temperature angular cross-power spectra using bolometric detectors...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model-independent {{investigation}} of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data with respect to scale-independent and scale-dependent non-Gaussianities (NGs). To this end, we employ the method of constrained randomization. For generating so-called surrogate maps a well-specified shuffling scheme {{is applied to the}} Fourier phases of the original data, which allows us to test <b>for</b> <b>the</b> presence of higher order correlations (HOCs) also and especially on well-defined scales. Using scaling indices as test statistics <b>for</b> <b>the</b> HOCs in the maps we find highly significant signatures for NGs when considering all scales. We test for NGs in four different l-bands Δl, namely in the bands Δl=[2, 20], [20, 60], [60, 120] and [120, 300]. We find highly significant signatures for both NGs and ecliptic hemispherical asymmetries <b>for</b> <b>the</b> interval Δl=[2, 20] covering the large scales. We also obtain highly significant deviations from Gaussianity <b>for</b> <b>the</b> band Δl=[120, 300]. <b>The</b> result <b>for</b> <b>the</b> full <b>l-range</b> can then easily be interpreted as a superposition of the signatures found in the bands Δl=[2, 20] and [120, 300]. We find remarkably similar results when analysing different ILC-like maps based on the WMAP 3 -, 5 - and 7 -year data. We perform a set of tests to investigate whether and to what extent the detected anomalies can be explained by systematics. While none of these tests can convincingly rule out the intrinsic nature of <b>the</b> anomalies <b>for</b> <b>the</b> low-l case, the ILC map making procedure and/or residual noise in the maps can also lead to NGs at small scales. Our investigations prove that there are phase correlations in the WMAP data of the cosmic microwave background. In the absence of an explanation in terms of Galactic foregrounds or known systematic artefacts, the signatures at low l must so far be taken to be cosmological at high significance. These findings would strongly disagree with predictions of isotropic cosmologies with single field slow roll inflation. The task is now to elucidate the origin of the phase correlations and to understand the physical processes leading to these scale-dependent NGs - {{if it turns out that}} systematics as a cause for them must be ruled out...|$|R
40|$|Interferometry {{has been}} a very {{successful}} tool for measuring anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. Interferometers provided the first constraints on CMB anisotropies on small angular scales (l~ 10000) in the 1980 s and then in the late 1990 s and early 2000 s made ground-breaking measurements of the CMB power spectrum at intermediate and small angular scales covering <b>the</b> <b>l-range</b> ~ 100 - 4000. In 2002 the DASI made the first detection of CMB polarization which remains a major goal for current and future CMB experiments. Interferometers have also made major contributions to the detection and surveying of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in galaxy clusters. In this short review I cover the key aspects that made interferometry well-suited to CMB measurements and summarise some of the central observations that have been made. I look to the future and in particular to HI intensity mapping at high redshifts that could make use of the advantages of interferometry. Comment: 8 pages, 2 tables.

40|$|Accepted???. Received???; in {{original}} form??? With its increased sensitivity and resolution, the Planck satellite {{is expected to}} improve the measurement of most cosmological parameters by several factors with respect to current WMAP results. The actual performance however, may depend upon {{various aspects of the}} data analysis. In this paper we analyse the impact of specifics of the data analysis on the actual final results. We also explore the synergies in combining Planck results with future galaxy surveys. We find that Planck will improve constraints on most cosmological parameters by a factor 3 – 4 and on the tensor–to–scalar ratio r by a factor 9. Also inflationary parameters, like r, ns and nrun, are practically not degenerate any longer. The tensor spectral index, however, is little constrained. A combination of the 70 to 143 GHz channels will contain about 90 % of all possible information, with 143 GHz polarisation information carrying about half of the constraining power on r. Also, the error on r degrades by a factor 2 if no B modes are considered in the analysis. High–l temperature information is essential for determination of ns and Ωb, while improving noise properties increase <b>the</b> <b>l–range</b> where Planck would be cosmi...|$|R
