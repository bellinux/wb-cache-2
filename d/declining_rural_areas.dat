The area of Tuscany was classified into five categories (see Tuscany Region 2007 for a definition of the criteria used). Municipalities located inside urban areas belong to the first category, (poli_urb). The second category (rur_int) contains municipalities located in areas whose population density is lower than 300 inhabitants per square kilometre but with very intensive production. The three remaining zones correspond to rural areas characterised by increasing socio-economic concerns, namely rural areas in transition (rur_trans), <b>declining</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> (rur_decl), and rural areas with development problems (rur_probsv). To identify these additional three categories, variables concerning the share of agricultural labour in the total labour force with respect to the EU 25 average value, were considered in order to identify a declining rural area (rur_decl). Finally rural areas in transition and rural areas with development problems were identified using criteria of urban density less than 150 inhabitants. An additional criterion to distinguish between these two was the amount of tourism in the municipality. Thus municipalities close to urban areas or with tourist attractions (for example in coastal areas) were classified as rural areas in transition (rur_trans), while others were classified as <b>declining</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> (rur_decl).|$|E

The policies were formulated and adopted through an alliance of technical justification by planning officers and political ratification by an important group of councillors acting from motives of paternalism, beneficence, and philanthropy. Policymaking procedures were carefully orchestrated such that agreement could be forged within the county arena for a 'consensus' polity option containing significant elements of prorural policy. Once the Structure Plan was sent for scrutiny at central government level, however, the managerial expertise exerted by local state officials and politicians were undone by the more general concerns of the central state to restrict planning powers. The approved plan was diluted, and the perceived 'art-of-the-possible' at county level was shown to be out of line with that of central government, with a consequent loss of innovation for rural policy implementation. ...|$|E

Commuter flows have strengthened since 1970, becoming more important in declining rural counties as well as growing suburban and exurban labor markets.

Evidence is presented of attempts via various mechanisms to transfer institutional values generated at county level to the actions and decisionmaking of other organisations, particularly the district councils. Although some transfers have occurred at policy level, the enactment of policies in most cases has not reflected the intentions of the county authority. Such intentions have been frustrated both by the nature of the institutional culture operating at county level, where prorural dispositions were subject to the higher priorities of financial constraint, and by the fundamental preservation by other agencies of their own (albeit declining) powers of financial allocation. Policy implementation has therefore taken the form of a centrally constrained, low-cost search for visible policy responses which rely increasingly on the resources of the private and voluntary sectors. ...|$|E

40|$|Significant demographic, {{social and}} {{economic}} change has come to characterise much of rural Australia, with some authors arguing there are now two sharply differentiated zones, one of growth and one of decline. This restructuring process, which has been similar to other western nations, has {{had a profound impact}} upon rural places—socially, economically and physically. Findings from research investigating the relationship between health, place and income inequality suggest that rural ‘desertification’, which is characterised by decline of the agricultural sector, net population loss and the deterioration of demographic structures, may negatively influence mental health outcomes in these areas. By contrast, the growth in rural areas, which is associated with expanding employment opportunities and the movement of capital and people, may confer positive benefits to mental health. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate differences in mental health and well-being between rural communities experiencing growth and decline as measured by net population change. Utilising a survey methodology, questionnaires were distributed to 20, 000 people randomly sampled from the electoral role in rural Australia. We selected four sub-regions from the sample area that were characteristic of areas experiencing population growth and decline in Australia and analysed the results of respondents from these four regions (n= 1334). The analysis provided support for our hypothesis that living in a declining area is associated with poorer mental health status; however, the factors that underpin growth and decline may also be important in influencing mental health. Discussed are the mechanisms by which demographic and social change influence mental health. The findings of this study highlight the diversity of health outcomes in rural areas and suggest that aspects of place in <b>declining</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> may present risk factors for mental health...|$|E
40|$|Rural {{development}} has attracted {{the interest of}} European regional and agricultural policies {{in the last two}} decades. This is more evident after the late 1990 ‘s when rural development became the second pillar of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). In Greece, traditional agricultural programs have given their place to rural development programs. This shift of emphasis in European agricultural policy reflects the change in the way rural development is perceived at an international level. Rural development is no more synonymous to agricultural development and the role of other factors such as alternative employment opportunities and accessibility to urban centers is widely recognized. Greece has a large agricultural sector compared to the European average, although employment in the primary sector has decreased significantly in the last three decades. In terms of rural development great differences are observed among regions which can be attributed to differences in agricultural potential and accessibility to the markets as well as to a differentiated degree of incorporation to international markets. The prospects of the agricultural sector in Greece would not be considered as favorable, especially after the latest CAP reform. Therefore rural {{development has}} to be promoted through non-agricultural activities or through some innovative agricultural activities. In this paper a series of indices describing the agricultural potential in the NUTS III regions in Greece as well as several aspects of rural development will be presented. Statistical analysis, mostly classification techniques, will be employed in order to explore the factors contributing to rural development in Greece. Special attention will be given to the introduction of organic farming in Greece and its potential contribution to rural development.

40|$|Rural {{areas are}} {{characterized}} by changing developments rather caused by processes or trends that occur in society (urban as well as rural environment). The mobility of people is increasing, including commuting, migration, tourism and recreation. Moreover, rural areas {{are characterized by}} a more and more urban character. This change in the rural landscape in turn affects out-migration and in-migration. Young people are migrating out of the rural areas; whereas {{a new group of}} (pre-) retirees are moving in some rural areas. Nevertheless, there is an implicit recognition by researchers that rural outmigration continuous and that depopulation will remain in the rural areas. Population decline entails a lot of new developments; the changing age structure and migration has direct consequences for the labour supply, education and facilities. Due to decrease in the demand for facilities, e. g. shops and hospitals close down. Moreover, due to the ageing population, the housing demand is changing. Therefore, several action plans are formulated by governments to respond on the population decline in the affected areas. This thesis is an elaboration of population decline in the rural areas of the Netherlands by a case study analysis of Zeeuws Vlaanderen. Within the thesis the characteristics of population decline in Zeeuws Vlaanderen are examined by analysing the current situation within the region and an analysis of the planning documents. The next question therefore is central in the thesis: How is population decline addressed in planning documents in the <b>declining</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> of the Netherlands? On a regional level Zeeuws Vlaanderen is characterized by a stagnating population with an ageing population and young adults moving out of the region. While on a municipal level, the municipalities of Sluis and Terneuzen are characterized by a decline, the municipality of Hulst is characterized by stagnation. In order to understand how population decline is addressed in the planning documents. The planning documents regarding population decline in Zeeuws Vlaanderen are elaborated by a qualitative content analysis. The main findings of the analysis of the planning documents are that population decline is addressed on a regional level and therefore the differences between the municipalities and thus the current situation are not taken into account in the planning documents. Moreover, the documents are focused on prognoses instead the current situation (planners’ approach). The conclusion of the thesis therefore is that although consequences and measures of population decline are addressed in the planning documents, there is a discrepancy between the current population decline in Zeeuws Vlaanderen and the population decline addressed in the planning documents Furthermore, this discrepancy between the planning documents and the current situation can be explained, by the Dutch planning system. This planning system is based on providing guidelines in a top down system and therefore suggests that the local level is waiting for guidelines on provincial level and the provincial level is waiting for the guidelines from the national level. Rural areas are characterized by changing developments including population decline. Therefore population decline is adopted within several planning documents to respond on the population decline in the affected areas. This Master thesis sets out to analyze how population decline is addressed in planning documents in the <b>declining</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> of the Netherlands. Population decline is analyzed by examining official statistics of the case study of the rural region Zeeuws Vlaanderen. On the basis of these results a qualitative content analysis of the planning documents is conducted to examine to what extent the planning documents are connected to the regional development. According to the statistical analyses, {{there is a need for}} a local response on population decline, while within the planning documents a regional strategy is chosen. Therefore it is concluded that a discrepancy exists between the current population decline in Zeeuws Vlaanderen and the displayed population decline according to the planning documents.

40|$|Faced with declining {{terms of}} trade, drought, {{population}} decline and a corresponding withdrawal {{of federal and}} state government support, Australia's rural towns and regions have been experiencing increasing difficulty since the early 1990 s. Where earlier responses to these problems took the form of industry assistance accompanied by welfare payments, politicians, public servants and rural development experts now advocate a more contemporary approach to rural revitalisation which may best be described as 'self-help'. Under this new strategy, the responsibility for tackling rural decline is placed firmly in the hands of rural people and their communities: a move which has prompted criticism that self-help is merely an excuse by governments who are attempting to relinquish their responsibilities. However, while declarations of empowerment may still be largely rhetorical, it is not the case that Australian governments have abandoned their rural citizens. Rather, in their new role as 'facilitator' of rural development, governments are attempting to provide the necessary support structures for local people through a range of mechanisms designed to build their capacity for self-help. The thesis draws on a FoucauldianlLatourian framework to explore how {{the power of the state}} continues to be deployed through the discursive practices of self-help to ensure local development initiatives remain consistent with the advanced liberal principles of enhanced competition and entrepreneurship. To begin with, the thesis undertakes a 'problematics' of power and government to consider how rural communities, and the problems they face, are constituted, through discourse, in such a way that they become amenable to particular forms of (non) intervention. While this problematics is achieved through a macro-level appraisal of government documents and policy state-ments, an analysis of how the will of the state is translated into more practical mechanisms takes place through a case study of two governmental technologies: the Queensland Government Department of Primary Industries' Building Rural Leaders Program and Positive Rural Futures Conference. These two sites may be understood as providing, respectively, the disciplinary and bio-political mechanisms for shaping the conduct of rural people in their pursuit of community economic development initiatives. Precisely how the activity of government is played out in rural areas can only be determined through micro-level analysis. For this reason, fieldwork has also been conducted in two rural communities in Queensland where local residents are taking a collective approach to addressing the problems they face. Importantly, it is through this primary analysis that the agency of the governed has become apparent. Local people do have the capacity to actively negotiate, resist and ultimately transform the discursive environment they find themselves in, and some have learnt to 'play along' to their advantage. The consideration that is given in this thesis to the will of the governed, as well as that of the state, has important implications. Not only does itchallenge conventional sociological accounts of rural areas in Australia that are characterised by decline, but it also creates the potential for a more comprehensive governmentality approach by supplementing notions of resistance with the Latourian model of translation. The research concludes that accounts of community agency are important to the sociological enterprise because they reveal rather than hide the possibility that exists for change and contestation in <b>declining</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> At the same time, however, it warns against naIve celebrations of self-help which have a tendency to heighten the division between so-called 'healthy', entrepreneurial communities that have learnt to conform to the demands of the state, and those 'unhealthy' communities that have not. With those falling into the latter group increasingly seen as responsible for their own decline, the effect is a channelling of resources into 'healthy' communities at the expense of those who need them most.
