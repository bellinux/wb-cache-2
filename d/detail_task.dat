The users thus stand in the center of two concentric circles. The inner circle includes the context of the product, objectives of developing it and the environment it would run in. The outer circle involves more granular details of task <b>detail,</b> <b>task</b> organization, and task flow.|$|E

40|$|The Correspondence Bias (CB) {{refers to}} the idea that people {{sometimes}} give undue weight to dispositional rather than situational factors when explaining behaviors and attitudes. Three experiments examined whether mindfulness, a non-judgmental focus on the present moment, could reduce the CB. Participants engaged in a brief mindfulness exercise (the raisin task), a control task or an attention to <b>detail</b> <b>task</b> before completing a typical CB measure involving an attitude-attribution paradigm. The results indicated that participants in the mindfulness condition experienced a significant reduction in the CB compared to participants in the control or attention to detail conditions.

Here below these achievements are described in some <b>detail</b> <b>Task</b> 1 (Hardy and Bergman spaces, interpolation) Teams 3 and 9 obtained [1] a characterization of interpolation sequences for the Bloch space, i. e. the space of analytic functions in the disc with bounded hyperbolic derivatives.

Using harmonic measure, teams 1 and 9 constructed noncyclic functions without zeroes in the disc for a very large class of weighted Bergman spaces [2]. Team 1 and team 7 [8] studied extremal functions as divisors for kernel of Toeplitz operators, with applications to the characterization of certain complete interpolating sequences (Milestone 2, task 1). Team 3 obtained a characterization of interpolating and sampling sequences for some spaces of entire functions.

40|$|Numerous {{methods to}} {{evaluate}} user interfaces have been investigated. These methods vary greatly in the {{attention paid to}} the users' tasks. Some methods require <b>detailed</b> <b>task</b> descriptions while others are task-independent. Unfortunately, collecting <b>detailed</b> <b>task</b> information can be difficult. On the other hand, task-independent methods cannot evaluate a design for the tasks users actually perform. The goal {{of this research is}} to develop a metric, which incorporates simple task descriptions, that can assist designers in organizing widgets in the user interface. Simple task descriptions provide some of the benefits, without the difficulties, of performing a <b>detailed</b> <b>task</b> analysis. The metric, Layout Appropriateness (LA), requires a description of the sequences of widget-level actions users perform and how frequently each sequence is used.
