Jobs and Powell had two more children, Erin, born in August 1995, and Eve, born in 1998. The family lived in Palo Alto, California. A {{journalist}} who grew up locally remembered him as owning the house with [...] "the scariest [...] decorations in Palo Alto...I don't remember seeing him. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>busy</b> being terrified." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 14, 2012, former Guns N' Roses members Slash, Duff McKagan, Gilby Clarke, Steven Adler and Matt Sorum all reunited at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The group {{performed}} [...] "Mr. Brownstone", [...] "Sweet Child o' Mine", and [...] "Paradise City" [...] with Alter Bridge and Slash's band vocalist Myles Kennedy in Rose's absence. Slash {{mentioned in}} an interview that [...] "All things considered, I don't think any of us {{wanted to be a part}} of it initially, didn't think any of us were going to go. It was a thorn in everybody's—well, at least a thorn in my side—because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>busy</b> doing other stuff. When it finally came down to the wire at the very, very, very last-minute—I'm talking about the 11 hours and 30 seconds mark—Axl had pulled out." [...] In the same interview, Slash mentioned the prospects of a reunion, stating [...] "It's not even something I like to dwell on. I don't even like to make comments because you end up with quotes that sometimes exacerbate the issue. I've got other things going on. I'm very, very proud—endlessly proud—of everything the band stood for and everything that's gone on with it." [...] Slash then stated in a July 2012 interview that [...] " [...] will 'never reunite'". In a later interview, former drummer Steven Adler stated that Matt Sorum would not take part in a potential reunion unless Adler was involved. Duff McKagan said in 2015, [...] " [...] could happen, and it could not. And I think it would be wonderful, one day, if we reconciled, first and foremost. That alone would be cool." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We Found Love" [...] premiered in the United Kingdom on September 22, 2011, on Capital FM, and {{was sent}} for {{mainstream}} adds in the United States on October 11, 2011. The song was released via iTunes on September 22, 2011. During an interview with MTV News, Calvin Harris revealed, [...] "'We Found Love,' is the most successful thing I've done ever... It's not strictly a song by me, obviously, it's by Rihanna. She sings it...It was great to work with her... No one could have taken {{it as far as}} she did. You can't escape it here [...] I've heard it a lot. I've heard it probably more times today than I did when I was mixing it. Which is a good thing... Ever since the Rihanna song did well, {{a lot of people want}} to do some stuff, which is great... That's what I enjoy doing. In terms of actual names, I've not done anything yet." [...] In October 2012, British singer Leona Lewis claimed that she was originally chosen to sing the song but ended up losing it to Rihanna when Harris went touring with the latter, commenting. [...] "I didn’t commit to it because I wanted [...] "Trouble" [...] to be my first single so I think that was another reason they went with Rihanna. It was the same version and production but mine’s better." [...] In 2013, Nicole Scherzinger claimed that she was the first artist given the song but ended up rejecting it, commenting. [...] "I've got the demo of that song and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>busy</b> at the time. They'd sent me a few dance tracks and I wasn't able to get to them and I was like, 'Oh there's so much dance and I want to take a break from it." ...|$|E
6000|$|I forget you, have {{forgotten}} you. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>busy</b> only at my burning, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>busy</b> only at my life. But {{my feet are}} on your grave, planted. And when I lift my face, it is a flame that goes up To the other world, where you <b>are</b> now. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not concerned with you. [...] I {{have forgotten}} you.|$|R
5000|$|A fourth method, also {{available}} in English, is using zijn (to be) with the adverb and preposition bezig met (busy with) and the gerund, e.g., Ik ben bezig met lezen (lit. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>busy</b> with reading), meaning <b>I</b> <b>am</b> (<b>busy)</b> reading. If there is an object, there are two forms: 1. the gerund is preceded by the neuter article het and followed by the preposition van (of) and the object, e.g. Ik ben bezig met het lezen van deze brief (lit. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>busy</b> with the reading of this letter), meaning <b>I</b> <b>am</b> reading this letter; 2. the object comes before the full infinitive (instead of the gerund), e.g. Ik ben bezig met deze brief te lezen (lit. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>busy</b> with this letter to read), meaning <b>I</b> <b>am</b> reading this letter. This form of the continuous is mostly used for a real (physical) activity. Grammar-wise, {{it is possible to}} say zij is bezig te denken (lit. she <b>is</b> <b>busy</b> to think, she is thinking) or hij is bezig te slapen (lit. he <b>is</b> <b>busy</b> to sleep, he is sleeping), but it sounds strange in Dutch. In these cases, other forms of the continuous are generally used, specifically the second method: Zij is aan het denken and hij is aan het slapen.|$|R

5000|$|A fifth method also {{involves}} the use of zijn (to be) with the adverb bezig (busy), this time followed by te and the infinitive, e.g. Ik ben bezig te koken (lit. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>busy</b> to cook), meaning <b>I</b> <b>am</b> cooking. If there is an object, it comes before the verb, e.g. Ik ben bezig aardappelen te koken (lit. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>busy</b> potatoes to cook), meaning <b>I</b> <b>am</b> cooking potatoes. This form is also mainly used for real activities. Zij is bezig te denken and Hij is bezig te slapen are uncommon.|$|R
