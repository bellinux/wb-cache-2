40|$|Tax haven jurisdictions {{have over}} the years been used and abused by {{individuals}} and companies to further their own interests or beneficial owner?s interests (e. g. Shareholders and beneficiaries in a trust) through investments made in these jurisdictions. These jurisdictions are largely used as a channel for tax evasion and to conceal criminal activities such as money laundering. Due to the growth in international trade and globalisation, it has become important to ensure that individuals and corporations are prevented from participating in harmful tax practices {{in an attempt to}} <b>evade</b> <b>tax.</b> <b>To</b> minimise investments in tax haven jurisdiction which are solely done to evade tax, the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation (?OECD?) set out some recommendations which are applicable on an international spectrum to combat this form of tax evasion. This dissertation addresses whether South Africa is complying with the recommendations of the OECD against investments in tax haven jurisdictions for purposes of evading tax. The importance {{of this study is to}} analyse South Africa?s compliance with the recommendations and to ensure that the standards currently in place to combat tax evasion are sufficient and to lay down recommendations that assist in ensuring transparency. By complying with international standards more particularly Bank transparency through Multinational agreements that enable signatory country to disclose information requested for tax matters. Should the recommendations by the OECD be fully implemented, it will enable South Africa to tax residents on their world-wide income, thereby ensuring that there are sufficient funds to cater for the poor and middle class people and enable economic growth within the country. In order to analyse South Africa?s compliance with the recommendations, the dissertation evaluate some of the anti-tax avoidance provisions in the Income Tax Act which are consistent with the recommendations of the OECD as well as some treaties entered into by South Africa.

On January 26, 1875, Bristow ordered Internal Revenue officers in various sites to different locations, effective February 15, 1875, on a suggestion from Grant. This would keep the fraudulent officers off guard and allow investigators to uncover their misdeeds. Grant later rescinded the order {{on the grounds that}} advance notice would cause the ringleaders to cover their tracks and become suspicious. Rescinding Secretary Bristow's order would later give rise to a rumor that Grant was interfering with the investigation. Although moving the supervisors most certainly would have disrupted the ring, Bristow conceded that he would need documentary evidence on the ring's inner workings to prosecute the perpetrators. Bristow, undaunted, kept investigating, and found the ring's secrets by sending Myron Colony and other spies to gather whiskey shipping and manufacturing information.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of the tax burden on tax evasion both {{theoretically}} and experimentally. We develop a model of tax evasion decision that is based on two ideas from behavioral economics: 1) taxpayers are endowed with reference dependent preferences that are subject to hedonic adaptation; and 2) in making their choices, taxpayers are affected by ethical concerns. The model generates new predictions about {{the effects of}} a change in the tax rate on the decision <b>to</b> <b>evade</b> <b>taxes.</b> Contrary <b>to</b> the classical expected utility model, but consistently with previous applications of reference dependent preferences to taxpayers’ decisions, an increase in the tax rate increases tax evasion.

We present results from a laboratory experiment that support the main predictions of the model. Tax Evasion, Prospect Theory, Adaptation...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} Russia's barter economy. Using interview data, it {{examines the}} mechanics of barter settlements and classifies the main types of non-monetary transactions. The major reason for barter is lack of a competitive monetary system. In the 1990 s barter represented a specific vehicle to perform settlements. Barter itself is not a way <b>to</b> <b>evade</b> <b>taxes</b> or <b>to</b> defraud enterprises of assets. But barter changed the motivation of enterprises and led to systematic distortion of accounting data. The low transparency of the barter economy creates barriers for investment and restructuring. The barter economy is an insider's economy. The lack of affiliated entity regulation and mechanisms for disclosure of transactions with related parties stimulates insiders to criminal application of barter and monetary surrogates. Barter has become a profitable business {{for a number of}} important economic agents including financial intermediaries affiliated with top managers of the biggest privatised enterprises and government agencies. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRisky {{as it may}} seem, a diachronic {{reconstruction}} of the demography of ethnic minorities in mainland Southeast Asia can, nevertheless, be achieved through critical analysis of available data. For instance, between 1863 and 1954, the French colonial administration conducted various population counts in he northeastern provinces of Cambodia, to which one must add three country-wide censuses in 1903, 1921, and 1926, {{and one in the}} then “newly-controlled” Haut-Chhlong area in 1936. Thanks to these and to a recent census conducted in 1998, we can reconstruct the growth {{of the population of the}} highlands, and demonstrate that the size of ethnic minorities populations was highly underestimated.

40|$|Ghosts are {{economic}} agents who <b>evade</b> <b>taxes</b> by failing <b>to</b> file a return.

The present paper develops a simple model of the audit decision for a ghost-busting tax agency which bases its audit strategy on signals of prosperous living, such as ownership of high-quality housing. Ghosts have a preference for high-quality housing, but may opt to own houses of a lower quality so as to escape detection. The paper compares the optimal audit rules and net tax collection under signal and blind auditing of the non-declaring population, deriving conditions under which each strategy will dominate the other. ...|$|R
40|$|In some {{classes of}} models, taxes at the owner level are "neutral" {{and have no}} effect on firm activity. However, this tax {{neutrality}} is sensitive to assumptions and no longer holds in more complex models. We review recent research that incorporates greater complexity in studying the link between taxes and business activity - particularly entrepreneurship. Dividend taxes on owners of large firms affect firm activity in models that include agency conflicts between owners and managers. Similarly, after incorporating entrepreneurs' occupational choice into the model, taxes are no longer neutral. By forsaking lucrative alternative careers, skilled entrepreneurs tend to have high opportunity costs, which make the choice of attempting to start a business of first order importance. Moreover, in models where it is assumed that capital flows across borders without cost, taxes on domestic business owners do not alter business activity because foreign capital seamlessly compensates for tax-induced declines in investments. This theoretical notion is contradicted by the strong "home bias" observed in business ownership, in particular for small firms and startups without easy access to international capital markets. Recent empirical work has emphasized that taxes have heterogeneous effects on mature firms, entrepreneurial startups, and owner-managed small firms. Lowering dividend taxes on firms with dispersed ownership has been shown to shift capital from mature firms into rapidly growing firms. Moreover, capital gains taxation tends {{to reduce the number of}} innovative startups and diminish venture capital activity, while high owner-level taxes encourage small business activity and non-entrepreneurial self-employment because such firms have more opportunities <b>to</b> avoid or <b>evade</b> <b>taxes.</b> <b>To</b> obtain efficient incentives in entrepreneurial startups, contractual terms are required that ex ante guarantee that all providers of critical inputs, especially equity constrained entrepreneurs, are entitled to a share of the resulting capital value firm. Unless properly designed, owner-level taxes prevent such ex ante contracting and thus lower the likelihood of eventual success...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a simple economy where self interested taxpayers may have incentives <b>to</b> <b>evade</b> <b>taxes</b> and <b>to</b> escape sanctions, by bribing public officials in charge for tax collection. The level of monitoring {{and the level}} of corruption are endogenously determined assuming that the price for corruption (bribe) sets at a value where expected rents in the public sector are completely dissipated in monitoring costs due to competition among public officials. In the proposed framework, larger fines for evasion will increase tax compliance with ambiguous effects on corruption while larger fine for corruption reduce corruption at the cost of reducing tax compliance. Interestingly, a utilitarian legislator will want to set maximal penalties. Intuitively, preventing corruption through fines is valuable to the planner since it reduces the amount of rent dissipation in the public sector at the cost of decreasing deterrence for the underlying offence (evasion). Finally the shadow value of deterrence is such that the level of public good provided in the economy is smaller than its first best. ...|$|R
