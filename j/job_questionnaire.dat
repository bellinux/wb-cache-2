Regression analyses supported the Investment Model, in that satisfaction with the job, investments in the organization, and alternatives to the job predicted organizational commitment, which in turn predicted OCB. While alternatives did not individually predict OCB, commitment was found to mediate the relationship between satisfaction and OCB and partially mediate the relationship between investments and OCB.

40|$|The <b>Job</b> Disposition <b>Questionnaire,</b> {{designed}} in the United Kingdom to assist in vocational guidance, has also been successfully applied {{in the selection of}} job applicants. An advantage of the <b>Job</b> Disposition <b>Questionnaire</b> over other guidance aids is its emphasis on the average and below average ability individuals. The present study was designed to examine the <b>Job</b> Disposition <b>Questionnaire's</b> potential use in New Zealand. A sample of 515 subjects, consisting of 270 school students and 245 members of six occupational groups was analysed. Factor analysis indicated that the <b>Job</b> Disposition <b>Questionnaire</b> was based on a limited number of specific factors rather than the more general factors outlined by the designers of the questionnaire. Discriminant analysis indicated that the questionnaire discriminates successfully among nurses, chefs, electricians, horticultural workers, forestry workers and secretaries. Investigation related to reliability gave mixed results, suggesting the need for further examination. A study investigating effects over a five year period indicated no significant changes in response pattern to the questionnaire.

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{substantial}} empirical {{evidence on the}} benefits of smoking bans; however, the unintended consequences of this anti-smoking measure have received little attention. This paper examines whether workplace smoking bans (WSB's) are associated with higher self-perceived, work-related stress among smoking workers. Methods A longitudinal representative sample of 3, 237 individuals from the Canadian National Population Health Survey from 2000 to 2008 is used. Work-related stress is derived from a 12 -item <b>job</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> Two categories of WSB's, full and partial, are included in the analysis, with no ban being the reference category. Analysis also controls for individual socio-demographic characteristics, health status, provincial and occupational fixed-effects. We use fixed-effects linear regression to control for individual time-invariant confounders, both measured and unmeasured, which can affect the relationship between WSB's and work-related stress. To examine the heterogeneous effects of WSB's, the analysis is stratified by gender and age. We check the robustness of our results by re-estimating the baseline specification with the addition of different control variables and a separate analysis for non-smokers. Results Multivariate analysis reveals a positive and statistically significant association between full (β = 0. 75, CI = 0. 19 - 1. 32) or partial (β = 0. 69, CI = 0. 12 - 1. 26) WSB's, and the level of self-perceived, work-related stress among smoking workers compared to those with no WSB. We also find that this association varies by gender and age. In particular, WSB's are significantly associated with higher work stress only for males and young adults (aged 18 - 40). No statistically significant association is found between WSB's and the level of self-perceived work-related stress among non-smoking workers. Conclusion The results of this study do not imply that WSB's are the main determinant of self-perceived, work-related stress among smokers but provides suggestive evidence that these may be positively related. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the relative merits}} of <b>job</b> specific <b>questionnaires</b> and various alternative assessment methods of occupational exposures often used in general population studies. METHODS: Subjects were participants in a hospital based case-control study of risk factors for male infertility. Estimates of exposure to organic solvents and chromium, based on <b>job</b> specific <b>questionnaires,</b> generic questionnaires, self reports of exposure, an external job exposure matrix (JEM), and a population specific JEM were compared with passive diffuse dosimeter results and measurements in urine. Urine samples {{from the end of the}} shift were analysed for metabolites of toluene, xylene, several glycol ethers, trichloroethylene, and chromium. Passive dosimeter date, metabolites of specific solvents, and urinary chromium concentrations were available for 89, 267, and 156 subjects, respectively. The alternative methods and measurements in urine were compared by means of the Cohen's kappa statistic and by computing the positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of the alternative methods against measurements in urine. RESULTS: Passive dosimeter results indicated that exposure classifications with <b>job</b> specific <b>questionnaire</b> information could discriminate between high and low exposures. The kappa coefficients were < 0. 4, so agreement between the various methods and measurements in urine was poor. Sensitivity of the methods ranged from 0. 21 to 0. 85, whereas specificity ranged from 0. 34 to 0. 94. Positive predictive values ranged from 0. 19 to 0. 58, with the highest values for <b>job</b> specific <b>questionnaires.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the implementation of <b>job</b> specific <b>questionnaires</b> in a general population study might be worth the extra expense it entails, bearing in mind the paramount importance of avoiding false positive exposure estimates when exposure prevalence is low. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{potential}} of three independent psychological scales (Rotter's Locus of Control, Karasek's <b>Job</b> Content <b>Questionnaire</b> [non-injury <b>job</b> stress], and Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale) to predict job satisfaction, as measured by Brayfield and Rothe's Index of Job Satisfaction, among salespersons in a small independent department store in Wichita Falls, Texas. An 82 -item survey which examined the dynamics of a salesperson's work life was administered to 20 individuals who were full-time employees of the department store. Demographic data were also gathered although these factors were not entered into the regression analysis. A multiple regression procedure examined the responses of the 20 employees who participated in the study. The R-squared coefficient indicates that 41 percent of the variance in Job Satisfaction was explained by the three predictor measures. A major proportion of this unexplained variance may be in variables outside the scope of this study, e. g., salaries, vacation time, benefits, bonuses, or commissions. Results suggest that the independent variables measured by the Locus of Control Scale and the <b>Job</b> Content <b>Questionnaire</b> in combination were the best predictors of job satisfaction with a significance level of. 01. The single best predictor was the <b>Job</b> Content <b>Questionnaire,</b> significant at. 03. The three instruments (Locus of Control, Self-Esteem, and <b>Job</b> Content <b>Questionnaire)</b> which comprised the independent variables, reached a significance level of. 03 in their prediction of job satisfaction (Brayfield-Rothe Index of Job Satisfaction). Study results indicate that a majority of the employees in the sample population were satisfied with their jobs and with the leadership style manifested by the store manager. In addition, job security was believed to be satisfactory. Inasmuch as there is a void in the literature regarding personal characteristics of salespersons as variables that interact with job satisfaction, comparisons of the findings of this research with other studies that have explored the intricacies of job satisfaction among salespersons who work in small, independent department stores cannot be made. Further research on the predictability of job satisfaction among salespersons in small, independent retail operations such as the department store investigated in this study would be useful not only to managerial staff in decision making and personnel management but would promote greater understanding of the personal characteristics of salespersons as human investment capital which has the potential to create the effective competitive edge required for survival in the new economy...|$|R
