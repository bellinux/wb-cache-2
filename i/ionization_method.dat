25|$|Photoionization (PI) was {{a method}} that was first applied as an <b>ionization</b> <b>method</b> to {{detecting}} gases separated by GC. Years later, it was also applied as a detector for LC, though the samples must be vaporized first to be detected by the photoionization detector. Eventually PI was applied to mass spectrometry, particularly as an <b>ionization</b> <b>method</b> for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Sample preparation for PI includes first ensuring the sample is in the gas phase. PI ionizes molecules by exciting the sample molecules with photons of light. This method only works if the sample and other components in the gas phase are excited by different wavelengths of light. It is important when preparing the sample, or photon source, that the wavelengths of ionization are adjusted to excite the sample analyte and nothing else.|$|E
25|$|In many mass {{spectrometry}} ionization methods, the sample {{must be in}} the liquid or gas phase for the <b>ionization</b> <b>method</b> to work. Sample preparation to ensure proper ionization can be difficult, but can be made easier by coupling the mass spectrometer to some chromatographic equipment. Gas chromatography(GC) or liquid chromatography(LC) {{can be used as a}} sample preparation method.|$|E
25|$|These {{lists are}} the most {{commonly}} used state of matter for each <b>ionization</b> <b>method,</b> but the ionization methods are not necessarily limited to these states of matter. For example, fast atom bombardment ionization is typically used to ionize solid samples, but this method is typically used on solids dissolved into solutions, and {{can also be used to}} analyze components that have entered the gas phase.|$|E

50|$|Spray <b>ionization</b> <b>methods</b> {{involve the}} {{formation}} of aerosol particles from a liquid solution and {{the formation of}} bare ions after solvent evaporation.|$|R
25|$|Other {{ionization}} methods may {{not require}} the liquid sample to be vaporized, and can analyze the liquid sample itself. One example is fast-atom bombardment ionization which can allow for liquid samples separated by the LC to flow into the ionization chamber and be ionized easily. The most common <b>ionization</b> <b>method</b> coupled to LC is some form of spray ionization, which includes thermospray ionization and more commonly, electrospray (ESI) ionization.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} of the MALDI technology and comparable instruments are today produced for very different purposes. From more academic and analytical, to more industrial and high throughput. The MS field has expanded into requiring ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry such as the FT-ICR instruments {{as well as more}} high-throughput instruments. As many MALDI MS instruments can be bought with an interchangeable ionization source (Electrospray ionization, MALDI, Atmospheric pressure ionization, etc.) the technologies often overlap and many times any soft <b>ionization</b> <b>method</b> could potentially be used. For more variations of soft ionization methods go to Soft laser desorption or Ion source.|$|E
2500|$|Sample {{preparation}} for mass spectrometry {{is used for}} the optimization of a sample for analysis in a mass spectrometer (MS). Each <b>ionization</b> <b>method</b> has certain factors that must be considered for that method to be successful, such as volume, concentration, sample phase, and composition of the analyte solution.|$|E
50|$|Proton {{abstraction}} {{is different}} from the three <b>ionization</b> <b>methods</b> mentioned above because negative ions (NI) are formed during the process rather than positive ions. (M-H)âˆ’ ions are often produced in polar organics in the NI mode.|$|R
50|$|Ambient <b>ionization</b> <b>methods</b> such as {{desorption}} electrospray ionization (DESI), {{laser ablation}} electrospray ionization (LAESI), nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI), matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (MALDESI), and liquid extraction surface anaysis (LESA), {{have also been}} employed for MSI.|$|R
50|$|In the TQMS, several <b>ionization</b> <b>methods</b> can be employed. Some {{of these}} include {{electrospray}} ionization, chemical ionization, electron ionization, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, {{all of which}} produce a continuous supply of ions.|$|R
2500|$|Chemical {{ionization}} (CI) {{is another}} method that requires samples {{to be in}} the gas phase. This is so that the sample can react with a reagent gas to form an ion that can be analyzed by the mass spectrometer. CI has many of the same requirements in sample preparation as EI, such as volatility and thermal stability of the sample. GC is useful for sample preparation for this technique as well. One advantage of CI is that larger molecules separated by GC can be analyzed by this <b>ionization</b> <b>method.</b> CI has a larger mass range than that of EI and can analyze molecules that EI {{may not be able to}} [...] CI also has the advantage of being less damaging to the sample molecule, so that less fragmentation occurs and more information about the original analyte can be determined.|$|E
50|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} laser ionization is an {{atmospheric pressure}} <b>ionization</b> <b>method</b> for mass spectrometry (MS). Laser {{light in the}} UV range is used to ionize molecules in a resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) process. It is a selective and sensitive <b>ionization</b> <b>method</b> for aromatic and polyaromatic compounds. Atmospheric photoionization {{is the latest in}} development of atmospheric ionization methods.|$|E
50|$|EI is a {{universal}} <b>ionization</b> <b>method,</b> but it does cause excessive fragmentation, and thus can be substituted with chemical ionization (CI) which is a much softer <b>ionization</b> <b>method,</b> and {{is often used to}} determine the molecular ion. One <b>ionization</b> <b>method</b> the utilizes CI is atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI). In APCI the ionization occurs at atmospheric pressure with ions produced by corona discharges on a solvent spray, and it is often coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) which provides quality determination of polar and ionic compounds in the collected atmospheric aerosols. The use of APCI allows for the sampling of the filters without the need of solvents for the extraction. The APCI is typically connected to a quadruple mass spectrometer.|$|E
50|$|Other <b>ionization</b> <b>methods</b> {{are often}} used for {{off-line}} mass spectrometer inductively coupled plasma (ICP). ICP is commonly used in the elemental analysis of trace metals, {{and can be used}} to determine the source of the particles and there health effects.|$|R
50|$|Subsequent {{studies have}} tried other {{instrumentation}} to improve mass resolution. Having a negative CI source {{at the back}} of the instrument interfered with the high-resolution analyzer in LQT-Orbitrap and quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF), so alternate <b>ionization</b> <b>methods</b> for the radical anions have been introduced.|$|R

Surface acoustic wave nebulization (SAWN) is a new technique that has been demonstrated to deposit less energy into ions upon ion formation and transfer for detection than other methods for sample introduction into a mass spectrometer (MS). Here we report the optimization and use of SAWN as a nebulization technique for {{the introduction}} of samples from a low flow of liquid, and the interfacing of SAWN with liquid chromatographic separation (LC) {{for the analysis of}} a protein digest.

50|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} {{chemical ionization}} (APCI) is an <b>ionization</b> <b>method</b> used in mass spectrometry which utilizes gas-phase ion-molecule reactions at atmospheric pressure (105 Pa), commonly coupled with {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (HPLC). APCI is a soft <b>ionization</b> <b>method</b> similar to chemical ionization where primary ions are produced on a solvent spray. The main usage of APCI is for polar and relatively less polar thermally stable compounds with molecular weight less than 1500 Da. The application of APCI with HPLC has gained a large popularity in trace analysis detection such as steroids, pesticides and also in pharmacology for drug metabolites.|$|E
50|$|APLI is a {{selective}} <b>ionization</b> <b>method,</b> because the 1+1 REMPI ionization requires an adequate existing electronic intermediate state and both electronic transitions must be quantum mechanically allowed.

50|$|Use of mass {{spectrometry}} {{as a second}} component of an operando experiment allows for optical spectra to be obtained before obtaining a mass spectrum of the analytes.

40|$|Matrix-assisted laser/desorption {{ionization}} (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) {{have made}} a huge impact {{in the analysis of}} biological materials. ESI has gained its popularity involving liquid based analysis, efficient fragmentation, chromatographic and electrophoretic separations but has a limitation for solubility restricted materials and surface analysis. MALDI is applicable to large biomolecule analysis and for surface methods useful for tissue imaging but is limited for structural characterization due to poor fragmentation and is ill suited for liquid based separation methods. The research presented here relates to new <b>ionization</b> <b>methods</b> that encompass the benefits of ESI and MALDI. These novel <b>ionization</b> <b>methods</b> produce multiply charged ions similar to ESI but directly from surfaces similar to MALDI. The formation of multiply charged ion extends the mass range of high performance mass spectrometers with advanced features for structural characterization such as ultra-high mass resolution and mass accuracy, and electron transfer dissociation. The surface method approach enables the detection, characterization, and identification of compounds directly from native environments such as tissue. The use of gas phase ion mobility separation reduces spectral complexity and improves the dynamic range of the experiment. Among the three novel <b>ionization</b> <b>methods</b> presented, MAIV has the potential to analyze fragile molecules and protein complexes, and is applicable for both atmospheric pressure and vacuum conditions.
