25|$|I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> {{people are}} getting very {{defensive}} about Black Swan and my role in it, but back-stabbing is not my purpose when people ask me about {{the legitimacy of the}} dance shots in the movie. I only care to speak the truth. The truth is that no one, not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come anywhere close {{to the level of a}} professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. She is so talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in Black Swan. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit that they deserve.|$|E
25|$|Hellenistic {{sculpture}} {{greatly expanded}} {{the range of}} subjects represented, {{partly as a result}} of greater general prosperity, and the emergence of a very wealthy class who had large houses decorated with sculpture, although we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> examples of subjects that seem best suited to the home, such as children with animals, were in fact placed in temples or other public places. For a much more popular home decoration market there were Tanagra figurines, and those from other centres where small pottery figures were produced on an industrial scale, some religious but others showing animals and elegantly dressed ladies. Sculptors became more technically skilled in representing facial expressions conveying a wide variety of emotions and the portraiture of individuals, as well representing different ages and races. The reliefs from the Mausoleum are rather atypical in that respect; most work was free-standing, and group compositions with several figures to be seen in the round, like the Laocoon and the Pergamon group celebrating victory over the Gauls became popular, having been rare before. The Barberini Faun, showing a satyr sprawled asleep, presumably after drink, is an example of the moral relaxation of the period, and the readiness to create large and expensive sculptures of subjects that fall short of the heroic.|$|E

2500|$|According to [...] (a {{professor}} {{who took part}} in the crisis committees) Franco Ferracuti, later discovered to be a member of P2 and who declared that Moro was suffering of the Stockholm syndrome towards his kidnappers, was close to the lodge during the kidnapping days, having been introduced by general Grassini. Licio Gelli declared that the presence of numerous members of P2 in the committees was casual, since numerous personalities were members at the time, and this was simply a statistic reflected by the composition of the committees. According to Gelli, some members of the committees did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of their colleagues were also part of P2.|$|E
2500|$|Gnomes {{are seen}} and {{mentioned}} in every book, {{but we are}} not told very much about their race in general. [...] They are described as being about 2 feet tall. [...] We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of them are professional wrestlers (fairy wrestling is done in zero gravity chambers). Gnomes have been described as slightly stupid and very argumentative, and that they have massive backsides. It is not mentioned on whether or not Gnomes are a family of the fairies. [...] There is more or less one notable gnome mentioned in the Artemis Fowl series (Ark Sool) as the successor to Julius Root. Jerbal Argon is also a gnome.|$|E
2500|$|A major study {{published}} more recently in Nature Nanotechnology suggests {{some forms of}} carbon nanotubes – a poster child for the [...] "nanotechnology revolution" [...] – could be as harmful as asbestos if inhaled in sufficient quantities. Anthony Seaton of the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh, Scotland, who contributed to the article on carbon nanotubes said [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of them probably {{have the potential to}} cause mesothelioma. So those sorts of materials need to be handled very carefully." [...] In the absence of specific regulation forthcoming from governments, Paull and Lyons (2008) have called for an exclusion of engineered nanoparticles in food. A newspaper article reports that workers in a paint factory developed serious lung disease and nanoparticles were found in their lungs.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the war in}} France and the Low Countries stagnated into trench warfare, the {{mobility}} of cavalry and other mounted troops was restricted leading to many cavalry regiments being dismounted and deployed {{on a range of}} tasks from that of infantry to menial tasks, including burying the dead. The loss of some of the squadrons' war diaries for {{the early part of the}} war means that much information is no longer available, but enough remains to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> men were deployed on fatigues, enough to render the squadrons non-existent from a [...] "military or fighting point". The historian of the British Cavalry, the Earl of Anglesey, noted that [...] "the cavalry were being used for every odd job where there was no-one else to carry it out". This led to many officers and men transferring to other arms because they felt they were not taking an active part in the war. The vast majority of [...] "Horse" [...] casualties in the Great War were when serving with other units during this period.|$|E
2500|$|... "On {{the stage}} sat four Indian men, {{one of whom}} was Sitting Bull. [...] There were two women and two {{children}} with them. [...] A white man came on stage and introduced Sitting Bull as the man who had killed General Custer (which, of course, was absolutely false). [...] Sitting Bull arose and addressed the audience in the Sioux tongue, as he did not speak nor understand English. [...] He said, ‘My friends, white people, we Indians are on our way to Washington to see the Grandfather, or President of the United States. [...] I see so many white people and what they are doing, that it makes me glad to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> day my children will be educated also. [...] There is no use fighting any longer. [...] The buffalo are all gone, as well {{as the rest of the}} game. [...] Now I am going to shake the hand of the Great Father at Washington, and I am going to tell him all these things.’ Then Sitting Bull sat down. He never even mentioned General Custer’s name.|$|E
2500|$|There are 8,000 {{journals}} and 4,600 in scientific fields. Almost all Chinese science organisations publish their own journal. The government owns or supports most journals {{with only a}} small number being privately owned. The [...] "publish or perish" [...] system has been argued to contribute to many low quality {{journals and}} articles that are infrequently cited and also to plagiarism and fraud. The Chinese government has put into place stricter regulations, punished or terminated some journals, and aims increase quality control and peer evaluation of journals as well as to create five to ten large publishing groups. As part of the reforms, in 2012 the China Association for Science and Technology, which oversees 1,050 journals, in a declaration listed various forms of misconduct, plagiarism, and fraud and as well, [...] the penalties for perpetrating them such as written warnings, blacklisting, contacting the researcher's home institution or funding agencies, or public disclosure. It has also been seen as important by increasing pressure on other journals and by informing editors who may not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> actions such as favoring researchers based on personal relations are unacceptable. China also plans to give substantial financial incentives to top journals based on factors such as their Chinese and international impact factor. It has been questioned if this will {{have an effect on the}} many poor quality journals who in return for money help researchers fill their institutional requirements for published papers.|$|E

2500|$|... 11 bullets is a {{very bad}} cricket team of North Kolkata. The team is formed {{with the people of}} the {{locality}}, who have various professions. The film starts with a match between 11 bullets and a cricket team of South Kolkata. The hero, named Abir, alone smashes 11 bullets. The team members of 11 bullets are then abused by the people of their locality. In the meantime, Abir comes with his family to stay at Dorjipara, which is the locality of 11 bullets. But, due to huge cultural deference between North Kolkata and South Kolkata, Abir becomes irritated to stay over there. The niece of the landlord of Abir's tenant house, stars having regular quarrels with Abir. Then one day, Abir comes to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> political leader is trying to grab Dorjipara, and for that, the leader wants the tenant house, which the landlord doesn't want to sell. When Abir teaches the 11 bullets people, that without protesting against these political evils, {{they will not be able}} to survive, slowly, those people come close to Abir, and vice versa. Then slowly, Abir gets intimate with Rani, which her brother Rajat doesn't like. A Person, Shankar, who is attached to that leader comes and gets involved with the unmarried, frustrated, elder sister of Rani, named Ratna. But, when Shankar says that, he wants to marry Rani, and not Ratna. Then Ratna commits suicide. Ultimately, when the party leaders come to take control over Dorjipara, Abir throws a challenge of a cricket match, which is going to decide, who's going to get control over the house. 11 bullets get a tensed and marvelous win, and Abir gets a romantic win over Rani.|$|E
