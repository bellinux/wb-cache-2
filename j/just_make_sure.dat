2500|$|The {{argument}} {{was based on}} comments by K. Shanmugam, the Minister for Law, at a dialogue session on 9 May 2010. When asked whether Yong's case would affect Singapore's laws on the mandatory death penalty, the Minister had replied: [...] "Yong Vui Kong is young. But if we say, 'We let you go', what's the signal we're sending? ... We are sending a signal to all drug barons out there: <b>Just</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> you choose a victim who's young or a mother of a young child and use them as the people to carry drugs into Singapore." [...] Commenting to the media, Ravi {{said that if the}} clemency decision was indeed taken by the Cabinet and not the President, then since Shanmugam {{was a member of the}} Cabinet and these statements were made while Yong's case was sub judice, his remarks implied a prejudgment of Yong's appeal for clemency. The Ministry of Law rejected as [...] "incorrect" [...] Ravi's remarks that the clemency process was flawed. It stated that as the Government's policy on the death penalty for drug offences was a [...] "matter of public importance", the Government was entitled to comment on it. The Law Ministry also clarified that Shanmugam's comments were merely concerned with the Government's legislative policy and whether it would change, and that the Minister had not commented on any specific issue which was before the Court of Appeal at the time, or on what the outcome of the judgment should be.|$|E
