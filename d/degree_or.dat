40|$|The energy-minimized {{conformation}} of an infinitely long poly-(L,D) -alanine in single-stranded beta 6. 3 -helix {{was calculated}} by the molecular mechanics method. When energy minimization was started {{from a wide range}} of initial geometries, six optimized conformations were obtained and identified as the right- and left-handed counterparts of the beta 4. 5 -, beta 6. 3 -, and beta 8. 2 -helices. It was found that their conformation energies increase in this order, the beta 4. 5 -helix having the lowest energy. The backbone dihedral angles of the energy-minimized beta 6. 3 -helix were: phi L = - 116 <b>degrees</b> (<b>or</b> - 131 <b>degrees),</b> psi L = 122 <b>degrees</b> (<b>or</b> 111 <b>degrees),</b> phi D = 131 <b>degrees</b> (<b>or</b> 116 <b>degrees),</b> psi D = - 111 <b>degrees</b> (<b>or</b> - 122 <b>degrees),</b> omega L = 173 <b>degrees</b> (<b>or</b> 173 <b>degrees),</b> and omega D = - 173 <b>degrees</b> (<b>or</b> - 173 <b>degrees)</b> for the right-handed (or left-handed) helix. This helix was composed of 6. 30 residues/turn with a pitch of 4. 97 A. All the alpha-carbons of L- and D-configurations appeared on one common circular helix. Interestingly, small deviations (approximately 7 degrees) of the peptide bonds from the planar structure caused a considerable lowering of the conformation energy, and, at the same time, they produced more favorable fitting of the hydrogen bonds; the carbonyl oxygens and the nearest-neighbor alpha-hydrogens also took more favorable relative positions...|$|R
