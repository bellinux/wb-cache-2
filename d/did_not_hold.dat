The remainder of his career was spent in non-operational positions, as Commandant of Cadets at the United States Air Force Academy and as an official in the Air Force Inspector General's Office. His inability to rise higher as a general officer is attributed to both his maverick views and his penchant for drinking.|$|E

She <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but {{played a role}} in U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives. A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department and without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan. Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American press corps. The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.|$|E
5|$|During the Act's early history, Section 3(c) {{was little}} used; no jurisdictions were bailed in until 1975. Between 1975 and 2013, 18 jurisdictions were bailed in, {{including}} 16 {{local governments and}} the states of Arkansas and New Mexico. Although the Supreme Court held the Section 4(b) coverage formula unconstitutional in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> Section 3(c) unconstitutional. Therefore, jurisdictions may continue to be bailed-in and subjected to Section 3(c) preclearance. In the months following Shelby County, courts began to consider requests by the Attorney General and other plaintiffs to bail in the states of Texas and North Carolina, and in January 2014 a federal court bailed in Evergreen, Alabama.|$|E

5|$|Hamels was {{selected}} the Phillies starter for Game 1 of the World Series; the Phillies won 3–2, and Hamels earned his fourth win of the postseason. Hamels also started Game 5, which was suspended due to rain after {{the top of}} the sixth inning tied at 2-2, and receiving a no-decision; when Game 5 resumed the Phillies won 4-3 to clinch the World Series. Overall, Hamels made five postseason starts in 2008, going 4–0 with a 1.80 ERA. Hamels threw a total of 35 innings during the postseason, and held opponents scoreless in 28 of them; he never allowed more than one run in any of the seven innings in which he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> opponents scoreless. Hamels was named the 2008 World Series MVP.|$|E
5|$|In 1706, the Elector of Bavaria was {{deprived}} of his offices and titles for siding with Louis against the Empire. The following year, George was invested as an Imperial Field Marshal with {{command of the}} imperial army stationed along the Rhine. His tenure was not altogether successful, partly because he was deceived by his ally, the Duke of Marlborough, into a diversionary attack, and partly because Emperor Joseph I appropriated the funds necessary for George's campaign for his own use. Despite this, the German princes {{thought that he had}} acquitted himself well. In 1708 they formally confirmed George's position as a Prince-Elector in recognition of, or because of, his service. George <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> Marlborough's actions against him which he understood were part of a plan to lure French forces from the main attack.|$|E
5|$|In October 2001, Gordon {{partnered with}} Lloyd Levin and Universal Studios, hiring David Hayter {{to write and}} direct. Hayter and the {{producers}} left Universal due to creative differences, and Gordon and Levin expressed interest in setting up Watchmen at Revolution Studios. The project <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> together at Revolution Studios and subsequently fell apart. In July 2004, it was announced Paramount Pictures would produce Watchmen, and Michael Bay was considered to direct. Eventually, they attached Darren Aronofsky to direct Hayter's script. Producers Gordon and Levin remained attached, collaborating with Aronofsky's producing partner, Eric Watson. Paul Greengrass replaced Aronofsky when he left to focus on The Fountain. Ultimately, Paramount placed Watchmen in turnaround.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} {{shrinking}} and separation properties (two notions well-known in descriptive set theory) for NP and coNP {{and show that}} under reasonable complexity-theoretic assumptions, both properties <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> for NP and the shrinking property <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> for coNP. In particular we obtain the following results. 1. NP and coNP <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have the shrinking property unless PH is finite. In general, ΣnP and ΠnP <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have the shrinking property unless PH is finite. This solves an open question posed by Selivanov (1994) [33]. 2. The separation property <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> for NP unless UP⊆coNP. 3. The shrinking property <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> for NP unless there exist NP-hard disjoint NP-pairs (existence of such pairs would contradict a conjecture of Even et al. (1984)  [6]). 4. The shrinking property <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> for NP unless there exist complete disjoint NP-pairs. Moreover, we prove that the assumption NP≠coNP is too weak to refute the shrinking property for NP in a relativizable way. For this we construct an oracle relative to which P=NP∩coNP, NP≠coNP, and NP has the shrinking property. This solves an open question posed by Blass and Gurevich (1984) [3] who explicitly ask for such an oracle...|$|R

5|$|Many {{buildings}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> up to {{the shaking}} of the earthquake and those that did collapse often lacked any survival space, but lack of effective medical care and poor planning {{also contributed to the}} substantial scope of the disaster. Buildings that didn't collapse featured well-maintained masonry and skeletal components that were joined together adequately in a way that allowed for the building to resist seismic waves. Most bridges and tunnels and other public infrastructure withstood the earthquake but hospitals did not fare well. Most collapsed, killing two-thirds of the doctors, destroying equipment and medicine, and reducing the capacity to handle the critical medical needs in the region.|$|E
5|$|Newton {{returned}} to play three further matches for Somerset in 1887 and 1890, when they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> first-class status. He opened the innings {{for the county}} twice in 1887, passing 20 on {{three out of four}} occasions. During Somerset's successful 1890 season, when they remained unbeaten against other county opposition, Newton batted at number four, scoring 3 and 0, his final recorded appearance for Somerset. CricketArchive records one further appearance for Newton, playing in Felixstowe for the MCC against Suffolk in 1905, aged 52. Opening the batting, he scored 87 to help his side to a nine wicket victory.|$|E
