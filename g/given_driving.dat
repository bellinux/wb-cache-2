40|$|The Interactive Discourse Planner (IDP) plans text {{to justify}} and {{describe}} domain plans interactively. A speaker uses plan justication {{to have a}} listener adopt a rec-ommended plan; he uses plan description to enable a listener to execute a plan. The text plan that IDP formulates and executes incrementally is represented uniformly in the same knowledge base with the domain plans that are under discussion. In this way, the text plan and the domain plans are both accessible for analyzing the listener’s feedback. IDP can interpret vaguely articulated feedback, generate concise replies and metacomments, and detect feedback that initiates digressions. This paper focuses on how IDP plans. We have implemented a system that <b>gives</b> <b>driving</b> directions and route advice interactively. For <b>giving</b> <b>driving</b> route directions and advice, the system {{does not have a}} preset agenda.

Nanocrystals fabricated using a coordinative surfactant stabilized the faceted surface at a higher temperature than those fabricated using a noncoordinative surfactant. The growth rate of the surface under a <b>given</b> <b>driving</b> force was dependent on the surface structure, i. e., faceted or rough, {{and the growth of}} a faceted surface was a thermally activated process.

In particular, I show the role of crystal-liquid interfacial free energy in the formation of metastable crystals from metastable liquids at a <b>given</b> <b>driving</b> force. In a microscopic viewpoint, local structure similarity between the metastable crystals and liquid determines the crystal-liquid interfacial free energy, and thus the nucleation barrier for the metastable crystals.

Examination of the second harmonic response indicated an increase of the resonance frequency for an adherent MB: resonance radius increasing of 0. 3  ±  0. 1 μm for an adherent MB.

More generally, this algorithm can be used to compute the driving process for random curves that may not be SLE. Most of the material presented here has appeared before.
