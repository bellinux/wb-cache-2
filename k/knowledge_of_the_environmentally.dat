40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this bachelor's {{thesis is}} to analyse <b>the</b> {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly forms <b>of</b> tourism in <b>the</b> tourist region <b>of</b> Šumava. First of all there are characterised basic terms dealing with <b>the</b> issues <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly forms of tourism {{and with the}} tourist regions. Then the chapter concerning the tourism development in the protected landscape areas and national parks follows. A chapter considering <b>the</b> characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Šumava region is also included, it describes general information about the region, <b>the</b> offer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly forms <b>of</b> tourism and also the institutions occupying with this issue. A questionnaire survey is also a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis, it focuses on the awareness and <b>the</b> interest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly forms <b>of</b> tourism in <b>the</b> Šumava region. Considering <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> survey the author analyses <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly tourism in <b>the</b> tourist region <b>of</b> Šumava and proposes measures leading to effective tourism development...|$|R

40|$|Magnesium alloys {{have one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest {{specific}} strengths of all construction metals used. Specifically, magnesium alloy castings {{are used in}} the aerospace industry to reduce <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> aerospace vehicles. Coating systems must be employed to prevent corrosion of these magnesium alloys as they are also the most corrosion prone construction metals. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> chromium is employed for the conversion coating which forms <b>the</b> foundation <b>of</b> many of these coating systems. In an effort to phase these harmful chromates out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coating system and continue to use magnesium alloys, an environmentally friendly conversion coating has been developed. This paper explores <b>the</b> best types <b>of</b> methods used to evaluate the thickness and coating coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly conversion coating. Destructive and nondestructive techniques are developed to examine the thickness and surface coverage of this environmentally friendly coating. Specifically an eddy current measurement technique, light, confocal, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy techniques are used to determine <b>the</b> coating thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly coating through destructive evaluation. Three nondestructive evaluation techniques, including polarized light microscopy, infrared spectroscopy (Fourier Transform and Raman) and an infrared proximity sensor are used to determine surface coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly coating...|$|R
40|$|Simplicity is {{generally}} considered an important characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly lifestyle. This article questions this tenet. Nine dimensions of simplicity are proposed: non-ownership, lack of power, aesthetics, behaviour, naturalness, freedom <b>of</b> movement, <b>the</b> sedentary life/faithfulness to a place, education, and living lightly. Using these categories, the question is asked whether <b>the</b> cultural stereotype <b>of</b> simplicity corresponds to reality. <b>The</b> images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly lifestyles are analysed from an everyday perspective, including radical forms <b>of</b> self-sufficiency. <b>The</b> result is a conclusion contrary to the common belief: while <b>the</b> life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> typical consumerist is simple, <b>the</b> life <b>of</b> environmental virtue is complex. This finding directs attention to one part of N. Elias’ sociological theory, which understands the civilisation process as <b>the</b> replacement <b>of</b> simple behaviour with complex rituals...|$|R

40|$|In {{recognition}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmentally</b> sensitive nature <b>of</b> inlets and of {{a requirement}} to improve present <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> their function, <b>the</b> INDIA project has studied a small natural tidal inlet located in the Ría Formosa, Algarve, Portugal. The project has used state-of-the-art field equipment to study present day processes, {{and a range of}} nu~merical models to extend the spatial and temporal range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measurements. Underpinned by <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> inlet evolution over several years, and by <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> other inlet systems, a conceptual model describing the medium- to long-term evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inlet is presented. Key elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model are then examined with reference to field observations and to numerical simulations of tides, waves, sediments and morphology. Supported by historical evi~dence of inlet evolution in the Ría Formosa, the picture that emerges of inlet dynamics is essentially one of relative simplicity and predictability in the short- to medium-term...|$|R
