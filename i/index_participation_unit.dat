40|$|This study {{provides}} new evidence related to basket portfolio trading using the Canadian <b>index</b> <b>participation</b> <b>units,</b> TIPs. First, we determine {{the linkage between}} TIPs and the Canadian market {{as well as the}} US market. We show that TIPs are Granger-caused by the T 35, the T 300 and the S&P 500. Also, we find that the T 35, which is the basis of TIPs, exerts a substantial impact on the T 300; no relation was revealed between the T 35 and the S&P 500. Second, we study the effect of issues and redemptions of TIPs on the prices of TIPs, the value of the underlying index, and the prices of the constituent companies {{in the context of the}} hypothesis of negatively sloped demand curves for equities. Not only do we uncover a positive price effect stemming from the issue of TIPs for both the constituent companies as well as the T 35 Index, but we also document a stronger market impact for large as opposed to small issues. These results support the downward sloping demand curve hypothesis. In addition, we find that the abnormal returns are permanent thus supporting the imperfect substitute hypothesis as opposed to the price pressure hypothesis for new issues. The empirical evidence on the redemptions of TIPs does not support nor reject the downward sloping demand curve hypothesis. It is shown that, based on an information-cleansed sample, redemptions result in insignificant abnormal returns. Finally, it is found that the price of TIPs decreases (increases) following an issue (redemption...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} transport disadvantage using a 7 day activity-travel diary {{data from}} two rural case study areas. A composite <b>participation</b> <b>index</b> (PI) measure {{was developed for}} this study based on six indices measuring elements of travel and activity <b>participation.</b> Using the <b>index</b> the paper {{then goes on to}} compare these results, with the results obtained from other more traditional indicators used to identify transport disadvantage. These indicators are related to the size of activity space such as unique network distance travelled, number of unique locations visited, activity space area, activity duration, and fullness (shape) of activity spaces. The weaknesses of these indicator based measures are that: firstly, they do {{not take into account the}} relativity of the measure between different areas i. e. travel distance in terms of the wider context of available activities within an area; and secondly, these indicators are multi-dimensional and each represents a different qualitative aspect of travel and activity participation. As a result, six individual indices were developed to overcome these problems. These include: <b>participation</b> count <b>index,</b> <b>participation</b> length <b>index,</b> <b>participation</b> area <b>index,</b> <b>participation</b> duration <b>index,</b> <b>participation</b> type <b>index,</b> and <b>participation</b> frequency <b>index.</b> These are then aggregated to assess the relative performance in terms of these different indices and identify the nature of transport disadvantage. GIS was used to visualise individual travel patterns and to derive scores for both the indicator based measures and the index based measures. Factor analysis was conducted to derive weights of the individual indices to form the composite index measure. From this analysis, two intermediate indices were also derived using the underlying factors of the data related to these indices. Using the scores of all these measures, multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify patterns of transport disadvantage...|$|R

We show that a rather low insurance result also implies a rather low stock exposure, even if the insured opts for the <b>index</b> <b>participation.</b> Concerning the impact of the index dynamics, we emphasize that it is important to distinguish between jump and diffusion risk because the pricing of jump risk has an impact on cap rates that can be offered to an insured.

Spatial Data consist of data about real world such as a point on a map represent a place given its latitude and longitude information. Such information of real world constitutes spatial datasets.

40|$|We analyze {{ignition}} phenomena by {{resorting to}} the stretching rate concept formerly {{introduced in the}} study of dynamical systems. We construct a Tangential Stretching Rate (TSR) parameter by combining the concepts of stretching rate with the decomposition of the local tangent space in eigen-modes. The main feature of the TSR is its ability to identify unambiguously the most energetic scale at a given space location and time instant. The TSR depends only on the local composition of the mixture, its temperature and pressure. As such, it can be readily computed during the post processing of computed reactive flow fields, both for spatially homogeneous and in-homogenous systems. Because of the additive nature of the TSR, we defined a normalized <b>participation</b> <b>index</b> measuring the relative contribution of each mode to the TSR. This <b>participation</b> <b>index</b> to the TSR can be combined with the mode amplitude <b>participation</b> <b>Index</b> of a reaction to a mode – as defined in the Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) method – to obtain a direct link between a reaction and TSR. The reactions having both a large <b>participation</b> <b>index</b> to the TSR and a large CSP mode amplitude <b>participation</b> <b>index</b> are those contributing the most to both the explosive and relaxation regimes of a reactive system. This information can be used for both diagnostics and for the simplification of kinetic mechanisms. We verified the properties of the TSR with reference to three nonlinear planar models (one for isothermal branched-chain reactions, one for a non-isothermal, one-step system, and for non-isothermal branched-chain reactions), to one planar linear model (to discuss issues associated with non-normality), and to test problems involving hydro-carbon oxidation kinetics. We demonstrated that the reciprocal of the TSR parameter is the proper characteristic chemical time scale in problems involving multi-step chemical kinetic mechanisms, because (i) it is the most relevant time scale during both the explosive and relaxation regimes and (ii) it is intrinsic to the kinetics, that is, it can be identified without the need of any ad hoc assumption...|$|R

This is a follow-up study, from 1990 - 91 to 31 December 2000, of 6861 Swedish women and men, who were interviewed about their social participation, education, housing tenure and smoking habits. A social <b>participation</b> <b>index</b> was constructed, based on 18 variables from the survey. The outcome measure was CHD morbidity and mortality. Respondents with a CHD incident from 1986 until interview were excluded from the study. Data were analysed using Cox' regression and the results are presented as hazard ratios (HR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). In the sex- and age-adjusted model there was a gradient between the social <b>participation</b> <b>index</b> and CHD, so that persons with low social participation had the highest risk of CHD with HR= 2. 15; CI= 1. 57 - 2. 94, followed by HR= 1. 67; CI= 1. 23 - 2. 27 for those with middle social participation. In the full model, when education, housing tenure and smoking habits were included, the increased risk of CHD for persons with low social participation remained high, with HR= 1. 69, CI= 1. 21 - 2. 37.
