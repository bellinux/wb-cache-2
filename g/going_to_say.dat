5|$|Leroux {{was one of}} 21 {{professional}} athletes featured in ESPN's The Body Issue in 2013. She appeared semi-nude on one of eight covers for the magazine. Of the experience she said, I {{think a lot of}} females struggle with the way they look, and I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's a big deal to be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} days, Irwin sold his rights from his {{scoreboard}} business for $2000. Though he sent $1500 to May and only $500 to Elizabeth, his Boston widow {{was surprised at}} the gesture since Irwin rarely visited Boston and provided almost no financial support to their family. In fact, May said that he had not been away from New York {{for more than a few}} days at a time in 27 years. She said that his only long trips were baseball-related, when he would scout players in other cities. Before he left New York for the final time, he told May that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye to friends in Boston and that he would return to New York. Though neither woman knew of the other, Irwin's New York son Harold learned about an unknown brother while he was visiting his father in the hospital just before Irwin's death.|$|E

25|$|Be {{it known}} unto you that I have {{discovered}} that {{you and the other}} Sir W. H. are reciprocal polars with respect to me (intellectually and morally, for the Scottish baronet is a polar bear, and you, I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> are a polar gentleman). When I send a bit of investigation to Edinburgh, the W. H. of that ilk says I took it from him. When I send you one, you take it from me, generalize it at a glance, bestow it thus generalized upon society at large, and make me the second discoverer of a known theorem.|$|E

500|$|Tommy Davis, a {{representative}} of the Scientology organization, stated to the St. Petersburg Times that members of the organization were attempting to correct what they perceived as factual inaccuracies: [...] "The story that's being missed is there were people who were doing nonstop attacks on the church and using Wikipedia to do it. Those people have been banned." [...] Davis denied that Scientology leadership arranged a campaign to manipulate entries on Wikipedia. He asserted, [...] "The church is huge ... Scientologists are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about their own religion." ...|$|E

But I really don't care, I love her til our dying days and that's all that counts.|$|E

5000|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Andy Kellman of Allmusic {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, calling the album [...] "Cole's most free-spirited and adventurous album <b>to</b> date", <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that there are [...] "at least seven songs here that rate as highly as the best from the first two albums". Jim Farber of Daily News also gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, noting that [...] "Cole's assertions of sweetness and light hardly prove as seamless, or simple, as her songs declare". He declares that [...] "her makeover feels less like a day at the spa than a night at the shrink", <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that [...] "instead of seeming harrowing or dark", the album's result is [...] "soulful and fulfilling". The Boston Globe said that [...] "Cole emphatically dares to be different—and pretty great". On the contrary, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times noted that Cole [...] "let go of her doubt", <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that [...] "it's missed".|$|R

500|$|For the {{remainder}} of his speech, Colbert joked about other people in the audience, including Peter Pace, Antonin Scalia, John McCain, and Joe Wilson. During this section, he made another reference to global warming while talking about interviewing Jesse Jackson: [...] "You can ask him anything, but he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what he wants, at the pace that he wants. It's like boxing a glacier. Enjoy that metaphor, by the way, because your grandchildren will have no idea what a glacier is." ...|$|E

[...] Moore stated that OSI would remain a studio-only project [...] "until further notice".|$|E
500|$|Filmmaker Spike Lee, in an {{interview}} with Vibe, said he would not see the film, explaining [...] "All I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> is that it's disrespectful to my ancestors. That's just me... I'm not speaking on behalf of anybody else." [...] Lee later wrote, [...] "American slavery was not a Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western. It was a Holocaust. My ancestors are slaves stolen from Africa. I will honor them." [...] Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, interpreted the movie as [...] "preparation for race war".|$|E

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the 24 April, in Hamburg for the press conference the following day, Trevor-Roper asked Heidemann for the name of his source: the journalist refused, and gave a different story of how the diaries had been acquired. Trevor-Roper was suspicious and questioned the reporter closely for over an hour. Heidemann accused the historian of acting [...] "exactly like an officer of the British army" [...] in 1945. At a subsequent dinner the historian was evasive when asked by Stern executives what he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> at the announcement the following day.|$|E
500|$|Williams was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of women in academia; according to Nussbaum, he was [...] "as close to being a feminist as a powerful man of his generation could be." [...] He was also famously sharp in conversation. Gilbert Ryle, one of Williams's mentors at Oxford, said that he [...] "understands what you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> better than you understand it yourself, and sees all the possible objections to it, and all the possible answers to all the possible objections, before you've got to the end of your own sentence." ...|$|E
500|$|There's no {{chemistry}} between Astrid and the Doctor, she delivers her {{lines with}} a real lack of conviction and thus we never really believe in Astrid as a character. Where Catherine Tate's Donna in last year's special was overbearing, Kylie Minogue's Astrid is hardly there at all. It does make you wonder why casting Kylie {{was regarded as a}} coup. She's a pop star– of course she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> yes to being beamed into millions of homes in the run-up to Christmas. She's got a duff album to sell. In truth, Kylie should be grateful to [...]|$|E

500|$|Stephen Lang is {{scheduled}} to return as Colonel Miles Quaritch, who led the humans in their conflict with the Na'vi in Avatar. Although the character died {{at the end of}} Avatar, Cameron confirmed in 2010 that Lang would return in the first three sequels, stating [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> exactly how we're bringing him back, but it's a science fiction story, after all. His character will evolve into really unexpected places across the arc of our new three-film saga". He later stated that Quaritch would act as main antagonist once again, in all four sequels.|$|E
500|$|... "Basketball" [...] {{contained}} several {{lines that}} became fan and cast favorites. Two of Michael's lines, [...] "The hand strikes {{and gives a}} flower" [...] and [...] "Blessed be those who sit and wait" [...] were described by Wilson as Confucian and biblical, respectively. Carell joked that Michael Scott himself should self-publish a book of inspirational sayings. Jenna Fischer revealed that her line, [...] "Please don't throw garbage at me" [...] was her favorite line of the first season. Michael's line, [...] "Try {{not to be too}} gay on the court" [...] was improvised by Carell and Krasinski's reaction was real, as he had no idea Carell was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it.|$|E
500|$|Reds catcher Clyde Sukeforth {{asserted}} that Wilson {{should have been}} credited with an additional home run in 1930 as well. [...] "He hit one in Cincinnati one day", he said, [...] "way up in the seats, hit it so hard that it bounced right back onto the field. The umpire had a bad angle on it and ruled that it had hit the screen and bounced back. I {{was sitting in the}} Cincinnati bullpen, and of course, we weren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything. But Hack really hit 57 that year." [...] Wilson's official total of 56 stood as the NL record until the 1998 season, when it was broken by Sammy Sosa (66) and Mark McGwire (70).|$|E
