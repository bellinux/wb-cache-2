5|$|One {{day before}} senior year, Veronica is working {{a job at}} a {{restaurant}}. Soon, a boy named Kelvin (Charles Duckworth) comes into the restaurant and says that he failed his drug test, even though he has been clean for ten months. Veronica sees an interview with her father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), on TV, and it is revealed that he wrote a book about the Lilly Kane case. The episode then flashes back to the romantic cliffhanger at the end of season one, and it is revealed that Logan was at the door. Logan reveals that the biker gang beat him up after he kicked Weevil (Francis Capra) in the face. Although he woke up with a knife and found one of the gang members was stabbed, Logan tells Veronica that he did not stab the gang member, and Veronica believes him. However, Leo (Max Greenfield) comes and arrests Logan. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) says that he and Meg (Alona Tal) also failed their drug test. Wallace informs Veronica about the details of the drug test, and the episode flashes back to show the details of Veronica and Logan starting to date over the summer. Veronica talks to all the students who were <b>framed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> drug test, and they all say some people might want to harm them. Veronica has become estranged from Meg, and Veronica reveals that Logan was released from prison soon after he was arrested.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we study}} {{stationary}} and nonstationary nonhomogeneous dual wavelet frames with an arbitrary real dilation factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> frequency domain by introducing and investigating {{a pair of}} frequency-based nonhomogeneous dual wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distribution space. This notion {{of a pair of}} frequency-based nonhomogeneous dual wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distribution space enables us to completely separate its perfect reconstruction property from its stability property <b>in</b> function spaces. <b>The</b> results <b>in</b> this paper lead to a natural explanation for the oblique extension principle for constructing dual wavelet frames from refinable functions without any a priori condition on the generating wavelet functions and refinable functions. A pair of frequency-based nonhomogeneous dual wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distribution space, that is not necessarily derived from refinable functions via a multiresolution analysis, has a natural multiresolution-like structure, which is closely linked to the fast wavelet frame transform. Moreover, nonhomogeneous dual wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distribution space play a basic role in understanding dual wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> various function spaces and have a close relation to nonstationary dual wavelet frames, which are of interest in applications. To illustrate the flexibility and generality of <b>the</b> results <b>in</b> this paper, we characterize a pair of fully nonstationary dual wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distribution space. Our results naturally link a nonstationary dual wavelet frame filter bank having the perfect reconstruction property to a pair of nonstationary dual wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distribution space...|$|R
25|$|A {{modified}} version of this theory was advanced in an influential 1955 review of Pictish by Kenneth Jackson. Jackson proposed a two-language model: while Pictish was undoubtedly P-Celtic, it {{may have had a}} non-Celtic substratum and a second language may have been used for inscriptions. Jackson's hypothesis was <b>framed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> then-current model that a Brittonic elite, identified as the Broch-builders, had migrated from the south of Britain into Pictish territory, dominating a pre-Celtic majority. He used this to reconcile the perceived translational difficulties of Ogham with the overwhelming evidence for a P-Celtic Pictish language. Jackson was content to write off Ogham inscriptions as inherently unintelligible.|$|E
25|$|When the Constitutional Convention {{convened in}} May 1787, the 12 state {{delegations}} in attendance (Rhode Island did not send delegates) {{brought with them}} an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature. New York offered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter. It was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency <b>framed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Constitution emerged.|$|E

Although the ceiling is riotously rich in illusionistic elements, the narratives are <b>framed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> restrained classicism of High Renaissance decoration, drawing inspiration from, yet more immediate and intimate, than Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling as well as Raphael's Vatican Logge and Villa Farnesina frescoes. His work would later inspire the untrammelled stream of Baroque illusionism and energy that would emerge in the grand frescoes of Cortona, Lanfranco, and in later decades Andrea Pozzo and Gaulli.|$|E

25|$|The Practice Advisory Department (PAD) is a {{division}} of the ABCLS which exists to promote the professional competency of land surveyors, which in turn protects the public interest. The protection of the public interest is of the utmost importance to the ABCLS, as <b>framed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Association's Mission Statement (see above). The PAD strives to monitor the competence level of the ABCLS membership while considering the expectations of the public, government, and ABCLS members. The PAD aims to ensure that all land surveys completed in British Columbia meet a high quality of standards, and that the overall integrity of the province's cadastre is maintained. In order to achieve these goals, the PAD initiated the Practice Review Program, which consists of two primary activities: an Annual Plan Review and a Practice Review.|$|E
25|$|Unlike some of Pisanello's other {{portrait}} medals, such {{as those}} of Leonello d'Este, the reverse of the medal of John presents no iconographic or allegorical mysteries. It shows the emperor on horseback, in profile to the right. Behind him, mounted on another horse, is a page or squire viewed from the rear and foreshortened. The emperor wears his distinctive hat and carries a bow on his left side and a quiver of arrows above his right leg. The double reigns of the emperor’s horse are visible and both horses possess elaborate straps over their hindquarters. The illustration conveys the arrest of a hunting expedition occasioned by John’s encounter with a pedestalled wayside cross. The gesture of the emperor’s raised right hand indicates his acknowledgement, in an act of piety, of the cross before him. The event takes place in a rocky landscape and is <b>framed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom portion by a Greek inscription: Ἕργον του Πισἀνου Ζωγρἀφου (‘The work of Pisano the painter’). This inscription is repeated in Latin within the top of the scene: OPVS • PISANI • PICTORIS.|$|E
