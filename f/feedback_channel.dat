50|$|In 2006 Lenz, {{together}} with Kühn, Zimo and Tams, started {{development of an}} extension to the DCC protocol to allow a <b>feedback</b> <b>channel</b> from decoders to the command station. This <b>feedback</b> <b>channel</b> can typically be used to signal which train occupies a certain section, but as well to inform the command station of the actual speed of an engine. This <b>feedback</b> <b>channel</b> is known under the name Railcom, and was standardized in 2007 as NMRA RP 9.3.1.|$|E

40|$|Objectives – The {{objective}} of this project was to redesign library spaces based on the user feedback obtained from a broad complement of <b>feedback</b> <b>channels.</b> The over-arching goal of this project was to develop an evidence based approach to the redesign of library spaces. Methods – Data from user-initiated and library-initiated <b>feedback</b> <b>channels</b> were collected and analyzed to determine priorities for library space changes. Online/onsite suggestions, a library onsite census survey, the LibQUAL+® survey, a whiteboard, ballot voting, and text voting were all used to gather input. A student advisory group {{was used as a}} sounding board for planned space changes before a final decision was made. Results – Data produced by different <b>feedback</b> <b>channels</b> varied both in the number of suggestions generated as well as the changes requested. Composite data from all <b>feedback</b> <b>channels</b> resulted in a total of 687 suggestions identifying 17 different types of space changes. An onsite whiteboard, the LibQUAL+® survey, and library census proved the most prolific in producing suggestions. Conclusion – Priorities for space changes were best determined through a composite of suggestions received from all <b>feedback</b> <b>channels.</b> The number of suggestions and requests received that were initiated by users was so small {{that it had to be}} supplemented with library-initiated feedback requests. The use of multiple <b>feedback</b> <b>channels</b> enhanced the number, variety, and scope of the suggestions that were received. Similar requests received through multiple <b>feedback</b> <b>channels</b> emphasized their importance to users. Focused follow-up <b>feedback</b> <b>channels</b> were effective in clarifying user suggestions for specific changes...|$|R

50|$|Certain networks, such as ones {{used for}} {{cellular}} wireless broadcasting, {{do not have}} a <b>feedback</b> <b>channel.</b> Applications on these networks still require reliability.

50|$|The Bidirectional Reliable mode differs in {{many ways}} from the {{previous}} two modes. The most important differences are a more intensive usage of the <b>feedback</b> <b>channel,</b> and a stricter logic at both the compressor and the decompressor that prevents loss of context synchronization between compressor and decompressor, except for very high residual bit error rates.|$|E

Closed-form expressions for lower and upper bounds on the achievable ergodic rates of ZF-DPC with Gaussian inputs and uniform power allocation are derived. Based on the closed-form rate bounds, sufficient and necessary conditions on the <b>feedback</b> <b>channels</b> to ensure nonzero and full downlink multiplexing gain are obtained. Our primary results show that for AF in both AWGN and Rayleigh fading <b>feedback</b> <b>channels,</b> it is both sufficient and necessary to scale the average feedback link SNR linearly with the downlink SNR {{in order to achieve}} full downlink multiplexing gain.

The more rapid the system's response to an error signal, {{the more likely it}} is that the system could overadjust; yet the need for prompt action is important because any delay in providing corrective input could also be crucial. A system generating feedback inconsistent with current need will tend to fluctuate and will not adjust in the desired manner.|$|E

50|$|In {{the theory}} of quantum communication, the entanglement-assisted {{classical}} capacity of a quantum channel is the highest rate at which classical information can be transmitted from a sender to receiver when they share an unlimited amount of noiseless entanglement. It is given by the quantum mutual information of the channel, which is the input-output quantum mutual information maximized over all pure bipartite quantum states with one system transmitted through the channel. This formula is the natural generalization of Shannon's noisy channel coding theorem, {{in the sense that}} this formula is equal to the capacity, and {{there is no need to}} regularize it. An additional feature that it shares with Shannon's formula is that a noiseless classical or quantum <b>feedback</b> <b>channel</b> cannot increase the entanglement-assisted classical capacity. The entanglement-assisted classical capacity theorem is proved in two parts: the direct coding theorem and the converse theorem. The direct coding theorem demonstrates that the quantum mutual information of the channel is an achievable rate, by a random coding strategy that is effectively a noisy version of the super-dense coding protocol. The converse theorem demonstrates that this rate is optimal by making use of the strong subadditivity of quantum entropy.|$|E

30|$|There {{have been}} various {{proposals}} for employing common feedback channels for broadcast/multicast channels [8 – 13]. The common <b>feedback</b> <b>channel</b> {{has been studied}} for the XOR-based network coding to estimate the number of users in error for a particular packet via a voice-vote mechanism [8]. For the redundant packet transmission of the Reed-Solomon codes, the common <b>feedback</b> <b>channel</b> also has been studied to reduce the uplink overhead [9]. The common <b>feedback</b> <b>channel</b> was considered for the retransmission of resource allocation information, such as with a MAP message in a WiMAX system [10]. The common <b>feedback</b> <b>channel</b> was used to obtain CQI information from the users [11]. A concept of the common <b>feedback</b> <b>channel</b> and its structure have also been proposed for IEEE 802.16 m systems [12, 13].|$|E
30|$|To reduce {{unnecessary}} redundant packet transmission, a <b>feedback</b> <b>channel</b> {{is introduced}} to the uplink channel. If a user does not receive a frame successfully, a request signal {{will be sent to}} the base station for transmitting the redundant packet. However, this would incur enormous signaling overhead in the uplink when a dedicated <b>feedback</b> <b>channel</b> resource is allocated to an individual user. Instead, a common <b>feedback</b> <b>channel</b> can be employed for NACK feedback information from all users, as discussed in Section 2.1. In the common <b>feedback</b> <b>channel,</b> all users send an identical NACK signal through the common uplink channel resource without carrying the users’ identifications. In the implementation, the base station may reserve a radio resource unit as a common <b>feedback</b> <b>channel.</b> The base station will keep transmitting the redundant packets until no signal is detected over the common <b>feedback</b> <b>channel.</b> Immediately after transmitting Lmax redundant packets, the base station is allowed to transmit the subsequent video frame.|$|E
30|$|Meanwhile, a <b>feedback</b> <b>channel</b> (as modeled in Figure 1) is {{essential}} to improving the bandwidth efficiency of RNC, especially when a real-time delay constraint is imposed. In case that no <b>feedback</b> <b>channel</b> is available, the additional retransmissions will be always limited to {{the maximum number of}} allowable retransmissions, hurting the bandwidth efficiency. In the application layer FEC scheme with random network coding, however, indication of successful reception by all receivers through the <b>feedback</b> <b>channel</b> can immediately eliminate unnecessary retransmissions, improving the bandwidth efficiency. Note that the efficiency by the different AMC design approaches (aggressive or conservative ones) depends on whether a <b>feedback</b> <b>channel</b> exists or not. One of our main contributions in this paper is to analyze the effect of common <b>feedback</b> <b>channel</b> on our cross-layer optimization in the multicast system.|$|E
