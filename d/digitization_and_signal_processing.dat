40|$|As {{digital imaging}} and digital image {{processing}} grow in their importance to medical and scientific applications, issues of image quality and utility in sensitive applications also gain importance. Analog images must be digitized {{if they are to}} be transmitted or stored in digital media or {{if they are to be}} subjected to {{digital image processing}} for assisting screening, diagnosis, <b>and</b> research. <b>Digitization</b> <b>and</b> digital <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> such as lossy data compression, enhancement, or segmentation all entail changing an image from its original form. A key question for all concerned with radiology is to determine when such changes indeed improve the quality or utility of the resulting images. We discuss here some of the issues that arise in demonstrating that one image is as good as or better than another in a specific medical application. 1 Introduction Radiology is becoming increasingly digital and hence has the capability of using digital communication links and storage facilities and [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the <b>digitization</b> <b>and</b> front-end digital <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> scheme for the wind-profiling Radar operating at 206. 5 MHz. The Radar operating at this frequency {{will have the}} capability to probe upto the lower Stratosphere upto ~ 20 km. In the present paper, the capabilities of digital receiver in performing functions like band-pass sampling at 206. 5 MHz using 16 bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based Digital Down Conversion (DDC) are demonstrated through simulation. The latest version FPGA is chosen in the present scheme for digital receiver design due to their relatively low cost, faster processing and inbuilt reconfigurability...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{measuring}} molecular‐beam epitaxy growth rates in near real‐time on rotating substrates. This is done by digitizing a video image of the reflection high‐energy electron diffraction screen, automatically tracking and measuring the specular spot width, and using numerical techniques to filter the resulting <b>signal.</b> The <b>digitization</b> <b>and</b> image <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> take approximately 0. 4 s to accomplish, so this technique offers the molecular‐beam epitaxy grower the ability to actively adjust growth times in order to deposit a desired layer thickness. The measurement has a demonstrated precision of approximately 2 %, which is sufficient to allow active control of epilayer thickness by counting monolayers as they are deposited. When postgrowth techniques, such as frequency domain analysis, are also used, the reflection high‐energy electron diffraction measurement of layer thickness on rotating substrates improves to a precision of better than 1 %. Since all of the components in the system described are commercially available, duplication is straightforward...|$|R
40|$|A clean {{determination}} of the tune value is important for stable SIS- 18 operation, especially for intense beams. The new data acquisition system for Beam Position Monitors (BPM) based on fast <b>signal</b> <b>digitization</b> <b>and</b> digital <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> [1] opens new possibilities for a sensitive tune measurement. In this system the broadband BPM signals are integrated bunch-by-bunch {{in order to get}} one position value (in vertical and horizontal plane) for each single bunch [2]. The measured position for the whole acceleration cycle is shown in Fig. 1 (right). Each point in the graph is an average over 1000 bunches. The obtained position resolution is better than 30 µm. For tune determination the so called ”Base-Band tune measurement” method is used. The non-integer tune value q is obtained from position data by calculating a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) typically over 2048 subsequent bunches. Since the FFT is calculated for equidistant points corresponding to the bunch positions, the frequency of the betatron oscillations is automatically normalized to the revolution frequency whereas no external parameter is required. Such frequency spectrum is expressed in units of q and ranges from 0 < q < 0. 5. The tune value measured over the whole acceleration cycle is shown in Fig. 1 (left). Each of the 153 points in the curve correspond to a peak position in the frequency spectrum described above. The observed tune value fluctuates within ± 0. 013 around the mean value of 0. 305. It has to be pointed out that the measured mean tune is shifted with respect to the preset value of 0. 32. This may explain the discrepancies between predicted and measured resonance positions discussed in [3]. For a stable and well adjusted beam no coherent betatron oscillation can be observed. In order to measure the tune value the beam was slightly excited using a digital pseudo Figure 1 : Vertical tune (left) and vertical position (right) of a beam of 3 · 10 9 Ar 18 + ions accelerated from 11. 4 to 450 MeV within 420 ms.

40|$|A highly {{flexible}} phase control system {{was developed in}} order to dynamically adjust the parallel wave number spectrum of driven LH waves on Alcator C-Mod. Wave coupling between the antenna and the plasma was studied using this system. A coupling code was modified to allow arbitrary phase and amplitude in each waveguide, which was required for agreement between the theory and experiment. Remarkable agreement was achieved when a small vacuum gap of 0. 6 to 1. 4 mm {{was included in the}} model, similar to results obtained on ASDEX. The location of the fast electron population is critical in diagnosing the performance of the lower hybrid system and can be inferred by measuring nonthermal bremsstrahlung emission. A state-of-the-art diagnostic for hard x-ray (HXR) emission was designed and used to make measurements of fast electrons bremsstrahlung during LHCD experiments on C-Mod. The HXR diagnostic consists of an array of 32 CdZnTe detectors to image energies in the 20 - 200 keV range. Detectors and pulse processing electronics were integrated into a compact and modular package. The system also makes use of fast <b>digitization</b> <b>and</b> software <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> techniques allowing a maximum counting rate of 1 MHz. HXR experimental results indicate a spatially broad and centered fast electron population. HXR profiles predicted by a synthetic diagnostic in the Fokker-Planck code CQL 3 D are narrower than the observed profiles, suggesting the importance of spatial diffusion of fast electrons in the experiment. Lower hybrid experiments on C-Mod represent the first results obtained with density, magnetic field, plasma shape, and source frequency all near conditions expected on ITER. In initial experiments, about 400 kW of LH power was coupled for 400 ms into low density L-mode discharges. (cont.) Clear evidence of current drive was seen as the loop voltage decreased by about 50 %. Studies were performed by varying the phase, density, and magnetic field as well as changing the direction that the waves were launched. Analysis using CQL 3 D indicates that a current drive efficiency of 0. 15 (1020 m- 2 A/W) was obtained by driving 167 kA of LH current with 410 kW at a line-average density of 5. 5 x 1019 m- 3, without an electric field. This efficiency exceeds what was observed on Alcator C, but is within the! range observed on FTU for similar densities. Including the residual electric field increased the LH driven current to 308 kA, corresponding to an increased effective efficiency of 0. 28. In addition to experiments, extensive modeling of current profile control through phase variation was studied, including compound spectra, using CQL 3 D. It was found that over 200 kA of off-axis LH current can be generated in a variety of profile shapes in an H-mode target plasma. Finally, time dependent modeling of an integrated scenario was performed using the transport code TRANSP to explore what performance can be ultimately achieved on C-Mod. Results indicate that fully non-inductive, quasi-steady-state plasmas are possible with bootstrap fractions as high as 75 %. by John E. Liptac, Jr. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Abstract: Authors {{present an}} {{analysis}} {{about the consequences}} of complex measurement <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> tasks. They show that measurement <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> problems of now-a-days open new dimensions for the interpretation of the basic concepts of measurement <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> make the reevaluation of these concepts necessary. Traditional methods fail in many cases to yield useful solutions, especially when measurement <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> problems reveal considerable complexity, involve a wide spectrum of various disciplines and require a multitude of components and methods. Since traditional methods, without a proper resource management supported at the system level, seem inappropriate to solve such problems, qualitatively new methods are needed. The present paper seeks answers to these problems. It gives a brief overview of various imprecise computational methods and discusses their applicability to treat complex measurement <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> problems. 1...|$|R
