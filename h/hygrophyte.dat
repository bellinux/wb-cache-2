40|$|AbstractFor an {{effective}} {{conservation and management}} in grasslands {{it is essential to}} understand mechanisms sustaining biodiversity. To gain knowledge is especially crucial in stressed grasslands harbouring a unique flora and fauna, like alkali grasslands. Aboveground vegetation, seed bank and environmental factors were studied in three stands of the following alkali grassland types: (i) Artemisia dry alkali grasslands at highest elevations; (ii) Puccinellia high and (iii) Puccinellia low grasslands at medium to low elevations, and (iv) Juncus wet alkali grasslands at the lowest elevations. We tested the following hypotheses: (i) Seed bank species diversity and density are the highest in the most stressed grassland types, where regeneration by seeds could have a major importance in sustaining vegetation diversity. (ii) Seed bank density of hygrophytes increases with decreasing elevation, because the cover of hygrophytes in the vegetation increases with decreasing elevation. The mean seed bank density ranged from 30, 104 up to 51, 410 seeds/m 2, which is higher than in most dry grasslands. Both the lowest seed bank density and diversity were detected in the most stressed Puccinellia high grasslands; Spergularia salina was the only abundant seed bank species (possessing at least 1000 seeds/m 2). These results not supported our first hypothesis. We detected the highest seed densities of almost all <b>hygrophyte</b> species in the lowest-elevated Juncus grasslands. But, we did not find a significant monotonous correlation between elevation and the overall <b>hygrophyte</b> seed bank density; because most of the <b>hygrophyte</b> species were missing from the seed bank at the medium-elevated, but most saline Puccinellia grasslands. Thus, our results only partly supported the second hypothesis. In total we detected more species in the seed bank than in the aboveground vegetation which emphasises that seed bank {{plays an important role in}} sustaining the diversity of alkali grasslands. However, characteristic graminoids possessed no considerable seed bank, except for Juncus compressus (up to 38, 619 seeds/m 2). We can conclude that persistence and establishment of most alkali grassland species are not supported by the local persistent seed bank...|$|E

40|$|A new pollen {{and plant}} macrofossil record fromPesce Luna (Fiumicino, Rome) {{provides}} {{the reconstruction of}} the vegetation history in the Tiber Delta region between 13, 000 and 8400 cal. BP. Marked fluctuations of hydro- and <b>hygrophytes</b> depict a variety of marsh–lagoon conditions reflecting marked changes in water-table level and salinity, determined by the transition from a continental environment with a strong fluvial influence, to a freshwater/brackish environment typical of an inner estuary, followed by a saline outer estuary environment. Both deciduous (mostly Quercus, Corylus, Tilia, Ulmus and Fagus) and evergreen elements (evergreen Quercus and Ericaceae) were already present during the Younger Dryas, being possibly enhanced by water availability and the vicinity to the sea that may have favoured long-term persistence of tree populations. Evergreen populations progressively increased during the early Holocene. Despite the strong effect of local environmental processes, a comparison of the Pesce Luna pollen record with other southern European sequences and the GISP 2 δ 18 O record indicates that the vegetation development was also influenced by centennial-scale climate processes acting at global scale. In particular, a mid-Younger Dryas climate reversal can be recognized at Pesce Luna, similar to other Mediterranean sites both in marine and continental environments.

40|$|The {{early studies}} about the plant ecology of Doñana {{carried out at}} a small scale showed that the main process {{controlling}} vegetation composition of the stabilized dunes was soil water availability. However, the extrapolation of this model to larger spatial scales failed to explain observed vegetation patterns. In this work, the vegetation patterns and the processes causing them are studied at a larger scale. Data of topography, soil pH, electrical conductivity, and available iron allowed to distinguish three large geomorphologic zones on the stabilized dunes of the Doñana Biological Reserve which correspond to different dune building episodes. Different dune episodes showed differences in both water table depth and dynamics, which are due to groundwater flow systems of different scale. It is further manifested by differences in shrub composition. The results show that geomorphology controls the vegetation pattern at different scales mediated through water availability. Differences in water availability are due to the connection to groundwater flow systems of contrasted scale. On a small scale (10102 m), along dune slopes, there is a gradient from dune ridges to slacks, from xerophyte to <b>hygrophyte</b> vegetation types.

Furthermore, endogenous ABA concentration in leaves and stomatal behavior {{vary with the}} species adapted to different water regimes. In this study, Ficus microcarpa, a hemiepiphyte, Salix warburgii, a <b>hygrophyte,</b> and Acacia confusa, a mesophyte, were used to elucidate the effects of leaf detachment on photosystem II (PSII) efficiency under osmotic- and high-light stresses. Results indicate that, under osmotic- and high-light stresses, PSII efficiency of the detached leaves was {{lower than that of}} the attached leaves for all three tree species, when compared at the same levels of stomatal resistance and leaf water potential. Exogenous ABA could mitigate the PSII efficiency decrease of detached F. microcarpa leaves under osmotic- and high-light stresses. Yet, the osmotic stress could raise endogenous ABA concentration in the attached, but not in the detached F. microcarpa leaves. In addition, partial root-zone drying exerted a significant effect on stomatal behavior but not on the water status of F. microcarpa leaves. These observations imply that the stronger ability of PSII in the attached leaves of F. microcarpa under osmoticand high-light stresses was probably due to the protective action of ABA from roots. On the contrary, endogenous ABA level of S. warburgii leaves was very low. In addition, partial root-zone drying produced no significant effect on its stomatal behavior. Therefore, PSII in attached S. warburgii leaves was possibly protected from the damaging effects of excess absorbed energy by signals other than ABA, which were transported from the roots...|$|E

These fully marine sediments are independently dated by marine faunas. Both records show significant shifts in the distribution of the main floral elements. Changing ratios of spore-pollen taxa, grouped as <b>hygrophytes</b> versus xerophytes and spores versus pollen, reveal major changes of the floras within the studied interval. One distinct turnover coincides with the Smithian/Spathian boundary where lycopsid and pteridophyte spores dominated assemblages change to pollen (pteridosperms and conifers) dominated assemblages. Lower Middle Triassic assemblages are again dominated by lycopsid spores while the assemblages from {{the upper part of the}} Middle Triassic and the lower part of the Late Triassic are characterised by dominance of coniferous pollen and show the decline of pteridosperms. In the latest Triassic fern spores are abundant and diverse. In contrast to the Middle Triassic the pollen assemblages are characterized by cycadophytes and Araucariacites. These distribution patterns are interpreted to reflect climatic changes. The presented results from Norwegian Boreal areas confirm the significant differences between quantitative distribution of specific taxa as well as diversity of major groups in plant assemblages from low and mid latitudes. The present survey opens new perspectives for more detailed comparisons and climatic interpretations of floras from the Triassic period, a time during which Mesozoic vegetation established. The major changes in the dominance of specific floral elements, especially the diversification and spreading of the conifers, can probably be related to climatic changes...|$|R

However, {{there has been much}} controversy on leaf traits response to grazing, thus more research should be conducted at the species level. Here we investigated the leaf area, leaf mass and specific leaf area (SLA) of 263 species in eight grassland communities along a soil moisture gradient in the Xilin River Basin, a semiarid grassland of northern China, to explore the grazing effects on ecosystem functioning. Results demonstrated that grazing decreased the leaf area and leaf mass in more than 56 % of species in the Xilin River Basin, however, responses of SLA to grazing varied widely between species. Grazing increased SLA in 38. 4 % of species, decreased SLA in 31. 3 % of species and had no effect on 30. 3 % of species. Annuals and biennials generally developed high SLA as grazing tolerance traits, while perennial graminoids developed low SLA as grazing avoidance traits. Considering the water ecotypes, the SLA-increased and SLA-unchanged species were dominated by <b>hygrophytes</b> and mesophytes, while the SLA-decreased species were dominated by xerophytes. At the community level, grazing decreased the mean leaf area index (LAI) of six communities by 16. 9 %, leaf biomass by 35. 2 % and standing aboveground biomass (SAB) by 35. 0 % in the Xilin River Basin, indicating that overgrazing greatly decreased the ecosystem functioning in the semi-arid grassland of northern China. Soil properties, especially fielding holding capacity and soil organic carbon and total nitrogen could mediate the negative grazing impacts. The results suggest SLA is a better leaf trait to reveal plant adaptability to grazing. Our findings have practical implications for range management and productivity maintenance in the semiarid grassland, and it is feasible to take some measures such as ameliorating soil water and nutrient availabilities to prevent grassland degradation...|$|R

40|$|The warming of {{the planet}} in recent decades has caused rapid, {{widespread}} permafrost degradation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. These changes may significantly affect soil moisture content and nutrient supply, thereby affecting ecosystem structure and function. This study aimed to describe the dynamic changes in thaw depth, assess the relationship between thaw depth and soil moisture content, and analyze the changes in species composition and water-use efficiency in response to permafrost degradation. We surveyed species composition, thaw depth, ground temperature, soil moisture, nutrient content, and foliar stable carbon isotope compositions to gain insights into the response of alpine grassland ecosystems to permafrost degradation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Moisture content of the surface layer decreased with increasing thaw depth. The correlation between thaw depth and surface soil moisture content was strongest in June and decreased in July and August. The strongest correlation occurred {{at a depth of}} 20 cm to 30 cm. The dominant species shifted from Cyperaceae in alpine meadow to mesoxerophytes in alpine steppe before finally shifting to xerophytes in alpine desert steppe. Thaw depth correlation was significantly negative with organic C content (r = - 0. 49, P < 0. 05) and with total N content (r = - 0. 62, P < 0. 01). The leaf delta C- 13 of Carex moorcroftii increased with increasing thaw depth and followed a linear relationship (R (2) = 0. 85, P = 0. 008). Permafrost degradation decreases surface soil moisture and soil nutrient supply capacity. Increasing permafrost degradation decreases the number of plant families and species, with <b>hygrophytes</b> and mesophytes gradually replaced by mesoxerophytes and xerophytes. The water-use efficiency of plants improved in response to increasing water stress as surface layers dried during permafrost degradation. Permafrost on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is expected to further degrade as global warming worsens. Therefore, more attention should be dedicated to the response of alpine ecosystems during permafrost degradation...|$|R
40|$|The indices found are {{analysed}} as a {{whole and}} general conclusions are drawn from them which may be of use in understanding many of the problems offered by the local flora (Ilhéus). The first column of the tables presented indicates the biological form of the species, showing the nature of the flora and the constitution of the climax. A total of 200 species of phanerophyta were found; 69 macrophanerophyta (trees), 54 are mesophanerophyta (treelets) and 77 are nanophanerophyta (shrubs). The macrophanerophyta are consequently considered as dominants and the meso-and nanophanerophyta as codominants (the biological forms: chamaephyta, hemicriptophyta, criptophyta, geophyta, therophyta, epiphyta and hydrophyta are subdominants), the more so as the first cover 80 % and the others more or less 50 %. This points to a climax of trees and a local vegetation mainly composed of trees also. The smaller forms are left out as they are beyond the present scope of this sort of wort in Brazil. The third column of ecological formulae indicates the reaction of the constituent species to light (C = sciophilous, F = photophilous and I = indifferents), the biological types of vegetation (H = <b>hygrophytes,</b> X = xerophytes and M = mesophytes) and the fidelity of the species to the climax. Of the species studied: 25 are pioneers (P. Table I), 63 are accidentals (A. Table II), 35 are companion species (O. Table III), 19 show preferences (E. Table with vitality Vn), 44 are selective (S. Table V) and 13 exclusive species (L. Table VI). This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} vegetation of the region is in full reconstitution. As to the ecological characteristics of the 200 species studied, 89 are either pioneers (a class separated by the author) or accidentals; this means that the devastated zones are being reconstituted in the subsere both with members of the prisere and alien species. Of the remaining species, 54 are companion, or accompanying species, which appear in most subclimax, serclímax and quasiclimax associations, and 57 are real constituents of the local climax. As all the species except the pioneers, selectives and exclusives (xerophytes and mesophytes) may be considered as <b>hygrophytes</b> this type evidently predominantes in the region and may constitute a hygrophilous serclimax and quasiclímax. In regard to light 101 are sciophilous, 32 indiferents and 67 photophilous. This leads to the conclusion that the vegetation comprises mainly tolerant species, showing the hygrophilous and mesophilous character of the region with a vegetation composed mostly of trees. The presence a large number of sciophilous species is easy to understand as the hygrophilous and mesophilous habitats and the dominance of trees favour the germination and growth of tolerant species. The last two columns analyse the percentage of individuals present and the occurrent classes to which they belong: 92 species vary between 1 and 9 %; 50 between to 10 and 19 %; 36 between 20 and 29 %; 14 between 30 and 39 %; and 8 between 40 and 49 %. Only 8 species belong to occurrence class V; 14 to classe IV; 36 to class III; 50 to class II; and 92 to class I. This leads to the conclusion that the local formation is very unsociable and very complex, though the median coverture is 80 % and the number of species is very large. The analysis of the data also shows that the climax is being reconstituted in the subsere with elements drawn from the prisere and alien species introduced either by man (following desvastation) or by other consequent factors (such as brusque changes of microclimates due to total or partial destruction). This modifies the subclimax appreciably and apparently also the climax of the local regional subsere. As a final conclusion it is suggested that as in the subsere the pioneer formation is xerophilous, the prisere also beging as a xerosere; but as there are and probably always were hydrophilous formation evolving in the same climate, the local climax is composed of species with medium exactions, that is of relative mesophites...|$|R

Podravske sastojine nadaleko su poznate po bujnom uzrastu, visokovrijednom drvu, a s fitocenološkoga stajališta po prirodnom, raznovrsnom i bogatom sastavu. U svojoj disertaciji Glavač (1960) je detaljno istražio i opisao dvije asocijacije u kojima prevladava crna joha: na staništima koja su poplavljena stajaćom vodom utvrđena je fitocenoza crne johe s dugoklasim šašem (Carici elongatae-Alnetum glutinosae), a na nju se sukcesivno nadovezuje mnogo suša zajednica crne johe i poljskoga jasena sa sremzom (Pruno-Fraxinetum). Obje su asocijacije bile prije toga istražene i opisane u Europi. Glavač je fitocenoze prikazao u sintetskim tablicama s 28 snimaka, utvrdio je njihov florni sastav, sistematsku pripadnost, sindinamiku, raščlanjenost i ostale značajke. Od Glavačevih istraživanja u proteklih pedesetak godina izgrađene su hidrocentrale na rijeci Dravi, promijenjeni ostali ekološki uvjeti i obnovljena većina crnojohovih šuma. To nas je ponukalo da recentnim fitocenološkim istraživanjima pokušamo utvrditi posljedice promjena na građu, dinamiku i strukturu sastojina u dvjema spomenutim asocijacijama. Na temelju 26 fitocenoloških snimaka i ostalih relevantnih podataka općenito smo utvrdili promjene u flornom sastavu u smjeru nestajanja hidrofita i higrofita i proširenju vrsta suših staništa, sukladno tomu znatnu promjenu odnosa površina istraživanih zajednica, njihova sindinamskoga razvoja i raščlanjenosti. U članku se govori i o problematici i potrebama detaljne fitocenološke razrade ostalih crnojohovih šuma u Hrvatskoj koje su istraživane relativno ekstenzivno i opisane u četiri asocijacije. U tom smislu obrazlaže se potreba šire analize i nastavka istraživanja. Forests {{of common}} alder in Croatia cover {{approximately}} 8000 ha (Prpić and Milković 2005). The most valuable stands {{are found in}} the management unit Đurđevačke nizinske šume in Podravina. In this area common alder forms pure or mixed stand extending over about 2000 ha. The stands manifest distinctly regular growth of good quality. From a phytocoenological aspect they are characterized by a natural, diverse and rich composition. The two associations dominated by common alder were studied and described in detail by M. Glavač in his dissertation of 1960. These associations include the phytocoenosis of common alder and elongated sedge (Carici elongatae-Alnetum glutinosae) growing in floodplain sites with stagnant water and micro-depressions, and a much drier community of common alder and narrow-leaved ash with birdcherry (Pruno-Fraxinetum) continuing onto the former community. There have been many changes in the past fifty years elapsing since the research by Glavač, including the construction of hydropower stations on the river Drava, drastic ecological transformations and regeneration of the majority of common alder forests. We have undertaken phytocoenological research in order to assess the consequences of the changes on the structure, dynamics and composition of these two associations. The planned field research was carried out in the vegetation period of 2006 using the standard method of the Braun-Blanquet school. In doing so, we were able to analyze and compare the findings, since former research was also conducted using the same method. Stands with a stable floral composition aged 50 and over were used for relevés. The relevés were sized 20 × 20 m on average. A total of 28 relevés were made: 7 in the forest of common alder with elongated sedge and the rest in the association Pruno-Fraxinetum. Mosses were not considered. The forest of common alder with elongated sedge (Carici elongatae-Alnetum glutinosae W. Koch 1926) in Podravina grows on peat and base-rich, humus gleyic soils saturated with water, which separate this community from the adjacent ones. The basic factor in the development of this community is the dynamics of groundwater oscillations. Here, alder is in its optimal stage of development. Preserved here since the glacial period, it has a relict character. It is classified into three subassociations: iridetosum pseudacori occurring in the wettest sites, where alder forms high cones surrounded with water almost throughout the year, polygonetosum hydropiperis growing in wet soils with a highly developed humus layer, and cornetosum sanguineae growing in relatively drier soils in progression. The floral composition of the community is given in Table 1, which contains 7 of our own relevés and 13 relevés by Glavač from 1960 showing a degree of participation. According to the research, the range of the forest Carici elongatae-Alnetum glutinosae has decreased manifoldly. Only some fragments have remained in water-covered depressions smaller than half a hectare from which water cannot escape. A comparison of the community’s floral composition some fifty years ago and today (Table 1) reveals changes not only {{in the size of the}} area but also in the composition of the plant species. There are fewer <b>hygrophytes</b> and species of swampy depressions with long-lasting stagnant water, such as Carex elongata, Poa palustris, Lythrum salicaria, Valeriana dioica, Rorippa amphibia, Calystegia sepium, Mentha aquatica, Carex vesicaria, and Glyceria fluitans, whereas some species, e. g. Spiraea salicifolia, have already disappeared. The natural syndynamic development has also stopped, so that only a subassociation with Iris pseudacorus can currently be identified. The other stands have already been converted to Pruno-Fraxinetum. The forest of common alder and narrow-leaved ash with birdcherry (Pruno-Fraxinetum Oberdorfer 1953) is formed by the succession from the previous association. It grows on drier and elevated terrains. It belongs to the order Fagetalia due to the lack of <b>hygrophytes</b> and the prevalence of mezophilic species. The floral composition of the community is given in Table 2. The first column shows 15 relevés by Glavač and the second 19 relevés from this research. A comparison of the phytocoenological relevés shows an increased proportion of mezophilic species and an absence or a reduced number of the species that indicate swampy and very wet forests. The species occurring less frequently are Galium palustre, Ranunculus repens, Lycopus europaeus, Poa trivialis, Valeriana dioica, and Potentilla reptans, while on the other hand Sambucus nigra, Corylus avellana, Prunus padus, Mercurialis perennis, Paris quadrifolia, Anemone nemorosa, Leucojum vernum, Galeobdolon luteum and Lamium purpureum have grown in number. Some particular sites currently feature Acer pseudoplatanus and Daphne mezereum, species that are not typical for the lowland area of Croatia. In the past fifty years, the area under these associations has increased considerably. The name and the description of the association originate in Central Europe, where these stands contain Fraxinus excelsior instead of Fraxinus angustifolia. For reasons of this and other differences, this community must be analyzed in detailed and compared with the Central European community. Its position in the phytocoenological nomenclature and systematics must also be determined. Changes in the stands of common alder occurring in the past fifty years are primarily the consequence of the synergy of altered ecological factors and anthropogenic factors, i. e. stand management. Although the groundwater levels in the forest stands being investigated are still relatively favourable (Fig. 3), the newly built hydropower stations in Slovenia and Croatia have generally altered the water regime. The main problem facing the remaining wet areas of the river Drava in Slovenia and Croatia is the low water level amounting to only 2. 4 % of the average water flow. Additional problems include significant oscillations of the river and the erosion of the riverbed. In the past 100 years the water surface area has decreased by 65 %, whereas open sites such as river islands and pebbly and sandy shoals have decreased by as much as 92 % (Schneider-Jackoby 2006). Another important factor in the analysis of the condition and changes in the forests of the study area is the type of management, or more accurately, the regeneration method applied on the stands of common alder. Stands over 80 years old are cut in a single treatment and the site is cleared and regenerated with seedlings of common alder in the same year. Although such an approach is highly efficient, cheap and good from a silvicultural standpoint, it does not take sufficient account of the ecological, vegetational and other specific features and differences. This results in the uniformity of the stands and sites and a decrease or disappearance of some species – primarily hydrophytes and <b>hygrophytes.</b> Moreover, the natural onset, participation and growth of other species, such as the narrow-leaved ash and even pedunculate oak, are slowed down. Changes caused by the construction of roads and the adjacent canals, as well as a direct human impact, constitute another important factor...|$|R
40|$|Pustynsky State Natural Reserve of Regional Importance (area 19, 730 hectares) was {{established}} by decree of the administration of Nizhny Novgorod oblast on September 16, 2013. It {{is located in the}} Tyoshe-Seryozhinsky karst area of the Oka-Sura karst region or Seryozhe-Panskoy karst lake district. Its creation is justified by the need to protect the rare species of living organisms, diverse types of vegetation, unique landscapes and plant communities that are concentrated in this territory. Despite the fact that in 1934 on the shore of the Great Lake in the Staraya Pustyn village the biological station of the State University of Nizhny Novgorod was founded, local flora of the karst lakes which are linked into a single system by the channel of the River Seryozha, remains insufficiently studied. In 2014 and 2015 the authors conducted a study of the flora of the Pustynsky lake-river complex. The collection of material for study of the taxonomic composition of the flora of the reservoirs and the collection of herbarium material were carried out by the route method from a rowing boat and, in part, by traversing along the shore. Taxonomic, ecological (including the spectrum of life forms of plants) and ecobiomorphological analysis of the flora, including the analysis of the ratio of its latitudinal and longitude elements, was carried out in cameral conditions. The taxonomic analysis of flora showed 162  species of vascular plants from 61 genera and 42 families, 6 of these species – Najas minor All., N. major All., Trapa natans L., Potamogeton praelongus Wulf., P. trichoides Cham. et Schlecht. and Carex bohemica Schreb, being included in the List of Rare and Protected Species on the Territory of Nizhny Novgorod oblast. On the basis of the annotated list of plant species, taxonomic, geographic, ecological-coenotic and ecobiomorphological analysis of the flora of the water reservoirs was made. We confirmed that the flora of the lake-river complex is traditional for this territory. Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Potamogetonaceae, Polygonaceae and Asteraceae belong to the dominant families and Potamogeton L., Carex L., Juncus L. and Salix L. belong to the dominant genera of the Pustynsky lake-river system. The level of the hybrid component of the flora is extremely low, which is typical for the watershed lakes. We found that a 6. 5 km stretch of the Seryozha River accounts for about 30 % of species of the vascular plants belonging to the flora in the Volga River basin. The high species richness of the flora of this territory is due, primarily, to the specific features of the shoreline, forming a broad range of habitats and the relatively stable water level regime despite the strong fluctuation in the level of anthropogenic pressure. We found that boreal and plurizonal elements dominate zonally but Holarctic and Eurasian species – regionally. The predominance of species typical for the ecotone zones of lakes (<b>hygrophytes,</b> hydrophytes and mesophytes) is an integral feature of the ecological-coenotic diversity which is characteristic of the Volga River basin. According to the Raunkiaer classification of life forms, hemicryptophytes are the most numerous group and the hamephytes are the least numerous one. A biomorphological analysis shows the predominance of vegetative mobile, clearly polycentric and vegetative immobile monocentric ecobiomorphs...|$|R
40|$|When soil is flooded, the {{rhizosphere}} quickly reaches oxygen shortage conditions {{because of}} oxygen consumption {{during the early}} stages of flooding, not only by plant roots but also by soil micro-organisms. Although this environment is generally disadvantageous to plant growth, <b>hygrophytes</b> and some mesophytes can adapt to these conditions. In these plants, aerenchyma (tissue with much enlarged gas space) develops in the petioles, stems and roots, and enhances transport of atmospheric and photosynthetic oxygen to flooded tissues, thereby preventing serious damage to root organs (Armstrong, 1979; Dacey, 1980; Drew et al., 1985; Drew, 1997). On the other hand, many mesophytes have little ability to develop aerenchyma so, if the soil becomes flooded, their roots may become oxygen starved and damaged (Smirnoff and Crawford, 1983; Justin and Armstrong, 1987; Laan et al., 1989). Therefore, aerenchyma formation is thought {{to be one of the}} important morphological adaptations to hypoxic stress. Two main types of cortical aerenchyma in stems and roots can be distinguished by their process of formation: lysigenous and schizogenous aerenchyma (Jackson and Armstrong, 1999; Evans, 2003; Visser and Voesenek, 2004; Seago et al., 2005). The former is created through cell disintegration (death) in the primary cortex of adventitious roots, as in rice (Justin and Armstrong, 1991), maize (Drew et al., 1979, 1981) and wheat (Huang et al., 1997), whereas the latter is formed by the separation of cells from each other, often accompanied by cell divisions and normal expansion as in Rumex species (Laan et al., 1989; Jackson and Armstrong, 1999; Colmer et al., 2004). The anatomical and morphological formation of both types has been reported in detail. In particular, much research has been done on the regulation of lysigenous aerenchyma formation using the roots of maize (Drew, 1997; Gunawardena et al., 2001) and rice (Kawai et al., 1998). However, another type of cortical aerenchyma was described in roots of Jussiaea (now Ludwigia) species by Martins (1866) and Schenck (1889). 100 years ago. Some Ludwigia species have pneumatophores (respiratory roots) that grow vertically upward and emerge above the water surface as in mangrove plants (Hartsema, 1927; Sculthorpe, 1967). The intercellular gas spaces are produced by radial elongation of living, thin-walled primary cortical cells. These aerenchymatous tissues are composed of a regular meshwork of rectangular spaces, and are produced in concentric layers in transverse sections of the roots (Martins, 1866; Schenck, 1889; Ellmore, 1981). The elongated cells appear T-shaped in longitudinal sections (Haberlandt, 1914). Although the variation is different from that of Ludwigia, recently intercellular gas space shave been shown to be produced by primary cortical cell elongation in adventitious roots of the wetland plant Pontederia cordata (Seago et al., 2000) and is termed ‘expansigenous aerenchyma’ by Seago et al. (2005). Sponge gourd (Luffa cylindrica, Cucurbitaceae) is an annual vegetable upland crop that originates in India and southern Asia, and is distributed mainly in tropical to warm-temperate areas. Compared with bitter melon (Momordica charantia), this species is flood tolerant, but its morphological changes in response to flooding stress have not been examined (Liao and Lin, 1996). In Taiwan, yield of bitter melon is increased by grafting with Luffa spp., which allows bitter melon to survive in flooded soils (Palada and Chang, 2003). In sponge gourd, it was found that the primary cortical tissues of newly formed adventitious roots under flooding created an aerenchyma that was neither schizogenous nor lysigenous, but took the form of elongated cortical aerenchyma. This aerenchyma is composed of cells that appear T-shaped in longitudinal sections. According to Jost (1887), intercellular gas spaces are created by T-shaped cells in roots of Luffa amara (now L. acutangulus). T-shaped cells that are secondary tissues derived from a phellogen are also observed in flooded stems of Ludwigia (Schenck, 1889, see the English text in Arber, 1920), and the lacunate tissues seem to be similar to elongated primary cortical aerenchyma. However, the origin of the lacunate tissues in the stem of Ludwigia is strikingly different from that of aerenchyma observed in sponge gourd. Recently, morphological observations of T-shaped cells derived from a phellogen were reported in the root and stem of Decodon species (Little and Stockey, 2003, 2006) and Lythrum salicaria (Stevens et al., 1997), but there was no detailed observation of T-shaped cells derived from primary cortical cells. Ellmore (1981) described elongated cortical aerenchyma in mature pneumatophores of Ludwigia, but did not report how lacunae were created at an early stage; therefore, an investigation has been carried out to determine the developmental processes of this type of aerenchyma. In addition, it was found that such tissues were composed of radially elongated primary cortical cells in flooded hypocotyl of sponge gourd, but not of T-shaped cells. Here, the morphological changes in flooded tissues and the pattern of cortical aerenchyma formation are described for sponge gourd, and the relative amount of aerenchyma is analysed...|$|R
