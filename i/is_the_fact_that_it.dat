5|$|One of {{the reasons}} the account's {{authenticity}} has been questioned <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> claims St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law. Offler doubted that canon law had penetrated to England to any great degree in 1088. The historian Mark Philpott, however, argues that St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law, since he owned a copy of one of the basis of canon law, the False Decretals. The bishop's manuscript of the Decretals still survives.|$|E

The point of portable software <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> can be placed on removable media (or any place on the local hard drive) and doesn't need installing; usually it is compressed into one executable file, by using software like VMware ThinApp or MoleBox.|$|E
25|$|The game {{objective}} is to outscore the opposing team. The sport is played on an ice surface, primarily by women and girls, and {{requires the use of}} ice skates. The sport uses a blue rubber pneumatic ring and all players, with the exception of goaltenders, use a straight stick. One of the sport's most recognizable and defining features <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> does not involve the use of intentional body contact as a strategic component. Despite its primary popularity among female participants, the sport is officially mixed.|$|E

500|$|What makes [...] "Ray Of Light" [...] one of Madonna's best singles <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is such a}} bitch to sing. Filled with {{multiple}} octave changes, it forced Madonna to push her vocal {{as far as it}} could possibly go. The song demanded she make use of her upper register and hold notes longer than she ever had before. It really is a techno gem that is always a standout at her concerts. After hearing a sample of {{it for the first time}} in the spring of 1998, I just knew that Madonna had outdone herself. The song brings the entire album of to a whole new level.|$|E
500|$|The Battle of Brunanburh {{was fought}} in 937 between Æthelstan, King of England, and an {{alliance}} of Olaf Guthfrithson, King of Dublin; Constantine, King of Alba and Owen, King of Strathclyde. One of the historiographical cruxes of this battle <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is often attributed to as the point of origin for English nationalism. Additionally, historians such as Michael Livingston argue that [...] "the men who fought and died on that field forged a political map of the future that remains , arguably making the Battle of Brunanburh {{one of the most}} significant battles in the long history not just of England, but of the whole of the British Isles." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} half of its first season, Fringe staff and critics noted that the series was still trying to define itself and its characters. The writers worked on {{balancing}} serialized storytelling with standalone plots and had to contend with continuous rewrites and expensive last-minute reshoots. For them, [...] "Safe" [...] marked {{a turning point in the}} series. They turned David Robert Jones into a recurring character and began to give Olivia more of a personal life. Actor Lance Reddick, who portrays Agent Broyles, later explained in an interview how important the episode was to the evolution of the series, [...] "We found who we were in episode 10, the episode where Olivia got kidnapped... We were trying to hedge our bets and trying to be too many kinds of shows at once. I'm not saying we got rid of the procedural element because each episode still is on a case – a case in terms of the quote-unquote police work — but it's not formulaic, not like the early episodes. What keeps the show most watchable <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is character-based." ...|$|E

2500|$|Important {{merit of}} the matrix [...] <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> allows to {{directly}} compute the frequency response of the equivalent network having the inductively coupled resonant circuits,. Therefore it is convenient to use this matrix when designing the cross-coupled filters. The coupling matrices , in particular, are used as coarse models of filters. Utilization of a coarse model allows to quicken filter optimization manyfold because of computation of the frequency response for the coarse model does not consume CPU time with respect to computation for the real filter.|$|E
2500|$|Clinicians {{have responded}} that they are unwilling to {{consider}} the possibility of leaving potential deadly cancers alone because it is [...] "far-riskier" [...] than the alternative. Eric Winer, director of the breast cancer program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, says, [...] "I don't know anyone who offers women the option of doing nothing." [...] Further complicating the issue of early diagnosis <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is currently impossible to distinguish malicious cancers from benign ones. Otis Brawley, a top official for the American Cancer Society, says that [...] "even if we overdiagnose 1 in 5, we have numerous studies showing that by treating all these women, we save a bunch of lives". For instance, a 2011 Cochrane review showed a sample of mammogram screening programs resulted in a 15% reduction in mortality rate despite over-diagnosis, indicating that mammography programs save lives regardless of over-diagnosis.|$|E

2500|$|The {{last part}} of the cross-less {{inscription}} is both unusual and partly problematic. The word ystarla could without context be interpreted as both [...] "westwards" [...] and [...] "eastwards", but since an austarla appears later in the inscription, it is agreed that ystarla means [...] "westwards". It is unusual, but not unique, that the y-rune (...) represents the v phoneme. An additional reason for this interpretation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would allow the {{last part of}} the inscription to be interpreted as a poem in the meter fornyrðislag. This would explain the use of the rune since vestarla permits alliteration with um vaʀit. It is not known whether he refers to Hróðgeirr (Roger) or Holmsteinn, but most think that it is Holmsteinn who had been westwards. The plural ending -u in the verb form dou shows that both Hróðgeirr and Holmsteinn died in the Ingvar expedition.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea for}} doing {{animation}} was born from the huge {{success of the}} film The Haunted Hotel, released by Vitagraph and directed by J. Stuart Blackton. It premiered in Paris in April 1907 and immediately there was a demand for more films using its incredible object animation techniques. According to a story told by Arnaud in 1922, Gaumont had ordered his staff {{to figure out the}} [...] "mystery of 'The Haunted Hotel'." [...] Cohl studied the film frame by frame, and in this way discovered the techniques of animation. It should be noted that Cohl, who was always seeking to enlarge his reputation in later life, never corroborated this story. Also, there were a fair number of films released before 1907 with stop-motion and/or drawn animation in them, by Blackton and others, any one of which could have taught Cohl animation, if he didn't just work the technique out on his own. The main reason The Haunted Hotel is significant <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was popular enough to make the arduous work of animation profitable.|$|E
2500|$|Pliny also {{cites the}} opinion of Nicias, {{according}} to whom amber:is a liquid produced by the rays of the sun; and that these rays, {{at the moment of}} the sun's setting, striking with the greatest force upon the surface of the soil, leave upon it an unctuous sweat, which is carried off by the tides of the Ocean, and thrown up upon the shores of Germany. Besides the fanciful explanations according to which amber is [...] "produced by the Sun", Pliny cites opinions that are well aware of its origin in tree resin, citing the native Latin name of succinum (sūcinum, from sucus [...] "juice"). He writes: Amber is produced from a marrow discharged by trees belonging to the pine genus, like gum from the cherry, and resin from the ordinary pine. It is a liquid at first, which issues forth in considerable quantities, and is gradually hardened [...] Our forefathers, too, were of opinion that it is the juice of a tree, and for this reason gave it the name of [...] "succinum" [...] and one great proof that it is the produce of a tree of the pine genus, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> emits a pine-like smell when rubbed, and that it burns, when ignited, with the odour and appearance of torch-pine wood.He also states that amber is also found in Egypt and in India, and he even refers to the electrostatic properties of amber, by saying that [...] "in Syria the women make the whorls of their spindles of this substance, and give it the name of harpax [...] from the circumstance that it attracts leaves towards it, chaff, and the light fringe of tissues." ...|$|E

David Smith scored the PlayStation 2 version 9.4 out of 10, giving it an [...] "Editor's Award" [...] and calling the Dark Alliance engine [...] "one of the best 3D engines yet devised." [...] He dismissed criticisms of the game as a [...] "Diablo clone," [...] arguing the gameplay is much deeper than such a comparison suggests. His only criticisms were some anti-climatic boss fights and repetitive music. He concluded [...] "There is honestly {{not a great deal}} to complain about here [...] Snowblind has put together one of the best engines on PS2 {{and one of the best}} hacks in the business, certainly the best a console has ever seen." [...] Kaiser Hwang scored the Xbox version 8.5 out of 10. He praised the graphics, but wrote [...] "What hurts this game's score <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is almost exactly the same game that was released last year, not that that's a bad thing. The game is a fine example of exceptional game-making. But an extra level or character, or really any added extras would've been great." [...] Fran Mirabella III scored the GameCube version 7.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "a downgrade from the PS2 version." [...] He criticized the [...] "bafflingly destroyed frame rate," [...] and commented [...] "When it was released on the PS2 a year ago, few could believe what Snowblind had pulled off on Sony's stubborn console. A year later, and quite magically, High Voltage couldn't get the engine running smoothly on GameCube." [...] Craig Harris scored the Game Boy Advance version 8 out of 10, arguing that [...] "Even though it's missing a few key elements from the original design it's based upon, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance works out very well in portable form." ...|$|E
