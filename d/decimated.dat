5|$|Crassus {{was given}} a praetorship, and {{assigned}} six new legions {{in addition to the}} two formerly consular legions of Gellius and Lentulus, giving him an estimated army of some 32,000–48,000 trained Roman infantrymen plus their attached auxiliaries (there being quite a historical range in the size of Republican Legions). Crassus treated his legions with harsh, even brutal, discipline, reviving the punishment of unit decimation within his army. Appian is uncertain whether he <b>decimated</b> the two consular legions for cowardice when he was appointed their commander, or whether he had his entire army <b>decimated</b> for a later defeat (an event in which up to 4,000 legionaries would have been executed).|$|E

Regional economic activity was severely lowered, as 19% of the local economy was related to Loring Air Force Base.|$|E

5|$|By 1972 FANK was <b>decimated,</b> {{the road}} and rail {{networks}} were smashed, and inflation was rampant. The rice harvest plunged from 3.8million tons in 1969 to 493,000 tons in 1973. Popular {{support for the war}} against the North Vietnamese and the insurgents had completely evaporated. The Americans, negotiating with the North Vietnamese, had proposed an Indochina-wide cease fire as part of the final settlement of the conflict in South Vietnam. By that time, however, Hanoi could make no commitment on behalf of its Cambodian allies.|$|E
5|$|Epidemics accidentally {{introduced}} by the Spanish included smallpox, measles and influenza. These diseases, together with typhus and yellow fever, had {{a major impact on}} Maya populations.

There was an outbreak of nationalist fervour in Vietnam; Tảng and Thảo joined the Vanguard Youth, an impromptu independence militia. Tảng was assigned to be the leader of the local unit, but he left the movement soon after, leaving Thảo in command. During this period, Saigon was regularly engulfed in riots.|$|E
