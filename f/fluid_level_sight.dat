40|$|ABSTRACT Many {{industrial}} activities need remote monitoring facilities {{to perform their}} works. One of data acquisition technology application is <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> monitoring system. It can be applied on gasoline level monitoring system in gas station, water level in water tank, etc. Conventional monitoring system has some weaknesses such as impracticability and data inaccuracy. Therefore, it is required to develop a <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> monitoring system which can be accessed via network using automatic acquisition. The purpose of the final project {{is to be able}} to monitor <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> in real time. In developing this <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> monitoring system, it uses webcam and digital image processing as the monitoring process which converting image result into the actual hight. webcam which is inside the box connected to PC and the <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> result is recorded in the database which is connected to network. Visual Basic 6. 0 is used in developing a data acquisition software and Microsoft Access file as a <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> database. PHP is used as a jaringan programming language. From the research, it can be concluded that <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> monitoring data acquisition can be done automatically using box which includes webcam and indikator inside it. Data from the acquisition using box <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> monitoring has an average difference of 0. 26 cm when it is compared with the meter reading. <b>Fluid</b> <b>level</b> monitoring data can be shown through real time designed network. Light indicator on wavy water condition can affects the indicator and causes error on actual height calculation. Whereas height range which can be monitored is 38 c...|$|R

40|$|Plasma {{levels of}} beta-endorphin and beta-lipotropin in 18 heroin addicts {{were found to}} be similar to those in {{pregnant}} control subjects at all stages of gestation. In contrast, amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> of beta-endorphin were significantly lower in heroin abusers than in controls in both the first and second trimesters. Amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> of beta-lipotropin were reduced only in the second trimester. At term, when the patients were almost drug free, the amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> of both peptides were in the control range.

This paper discuss a kind of working <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> measuring equipment, which is based on NI single-board RIO embedded real-time processing system. By combing existing analysis method with wavelet transform theory, this device can automatically calculate the sound speed in wellbore annulus, and recognize the waveform reflected by <b>fluid</b> <b>level.</b> Results show that the device can effectively detect the depth of the working <b>fluid</b> <b>level,</b> meeting the needs of normal production activities in oil field...|$|R

40|$|In {{stochastic}} fluid models {{the drift}} {{at which the}} <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> changes in the fluid buffer and the generator of the underlying process might depend on the discrete state {{of the system and}} on the <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> itself. In this paper we analyse the stationary behaviour of finite buffer Markov fluid models in which the drift and the generator of the underlying continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) depends on both of these parameters. Especially, the case when the drift changes sign at a given <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> is considered. This case requires a particular treatment, because at this <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> probability mass might develop. When dealing with sign changes, new problems that were not addressed in previous works arises. The set of stationary equations is provided and a transformation of the unknowns is applied to obtain a solvable system description. Numerical examples introduce the behaviour of fluid systems with various discontinuities and sign changes of the drift...|$|R

Overspill from pushing back pistons should be avoided, because glycol based fluid will quickly lift or strip paints and other coatings on contact (it can be removed by quickly washing with water, not wiping). Brake <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> may also be low because of a leak, which {{could result in a}} loss of hydraulic pressure and consequently a significant loss of braking ability.

40|$|A {{measurement}} {{system has been}} developed using a single tube capacitive sensor to accurately determine the <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> in non-stationary tanks, namely automotive fuel tanks. The system determines the <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> {{in the presence of}} dynamic slosh. A neural network-based approach is used to process the sensor signal and achieve substantial accuracy compared with the averaging method, which is normally used under such conditions. The sensor readings were obtained by experimentation carried out under various dynamic conditions. The sensor response was recorded at various slosh frequencies and fuel volumes; which was then used to train three different neural network topologies. Field trials were carried out to obtain the actual driving data for the purpose of testing the neural networks using MATLAB software. One static neural network topology, namely Feed-forward Backpropagation Neural Network, and two dynamic neural network topologies, namely Distributed Time Delay Neural Network and NARX Neural Network, have been investigated in this work. The developed <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> {{measurement system}} is capable of determining the <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> in a dynamic environment with a maximum error of 8. 7 % by using the two dynamic neural networks, and 0. 11 % using the static feed-forward backpropagation neural network...|$|R
40|$|A <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> {{measurement}} {{system based on}} a single Ultrasonic Sensor and Support Vector Machines (SVM) based signal processing and classification system has been developed to determine the <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> in automotive fuel tanks. The novel approach based on the ν-SVM classification method uses the Radial Basis Function (RBF) {{to compensate for the}} measurement error induced by the sloshing effects in the tank caused by vehicle motion. A broad investigation on selected pre-processing filters, namely, Moving Mean, Moving Median, and Wavelet filter, has also been presented. Field drive trials were performed under normal driving conditions at various fuel volumes ranging from 5 L to 50 L to acquire sample data from the ultrasonic sensor for the training of SVM model. Further drive trials were conducted to obtain data to verify the SVM results. A comparison of the accuracy of the predicted <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> obtained using SVM and the pre-processing filters is provided. It is demonstrated that the ν-SVM model using the RBF kernel function and the Moving Median filter has produced the most accurate outcome compared with the other signal filtration methods in terms of <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> measurement. ...|$|R

40|$|Today’s {{system to}} measure the volume in a tank {{consists}} of a vertically placed sensor. When a vehicle is tilted the <b>level</b> of the <b>fluid</b> might change and if the volume is calculated based only on {{the information from the}} sensor it could result in a incorrect value. This thesis exams a new method to calculate the volume in tanks by using sensor fusion to crosscheck the i formation from the level sensors when the vehicle is tilted. The information is then used to see if it is possible to identify the grade of tilt by the change of <b>fluid</b> <b>level.</b> If the grade of tilt can be measured then the volume can be calculated in a more accurate way. The accuracy of measuring the <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> depends on the tolerance; tank volume, sensor measurement and montage for both tank and sensor. This limitation is also examined. To exam if the tilt can be measured a volume calculation program was created to calculate the volume in tank as a function of tilt and <b>fluid</b> <b>level.</b> Volume calculation was done for both nominal cases and cases with tolerances for the tank and sensor. When analyzing the change in <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> from the data, the result was that the tilt can’t be determined in a sufficient reliable manner. The tilt combination causing the <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> to change could be more than one. This means that there are too many non unique solutions to determine the tilt with 5 degree accuracy...|$|R
