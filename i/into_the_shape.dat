5|$|Another early {{application}} of the Reuleaux triangle, by Leonardo da Vinci circa 1514 (or possibly {{by one of his}} followers at his direction), was a world map in which the spherical surface of the earth was divided into eight octants, each flattened <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of a Reuleaux triangle.|$|E
5|$|The {{pipeline}} {{has also}} inspired {{various forms of}} artwork. The most notable form of art unique to the pipeline are pipeline maps—portions of scrap pipe cut <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of Alaska {{with a piece of}} metal delineating the path of the pipeline through the map. Pipeline maps were frequently created by welders working on the pipeline, and the maps were frequently sold to tourists or given away as gifts. Other pipeline-inspired pieces of art include objects containing crude oil that has been transported through the pipeline.|$|E
5|$|At the FBI safe house, {{a police}} car arrives with Modell. Modell enters the room that Linda is in and locks the door behind him. Mulder tells Scully {{the news of the}} therapist's death and urges her to keep Linda away from a phone. At the safe house, Skinner finds Linda's room door locked. He kicks the door down to find Modell and Linda, with Modell calmly saying that he has a gun. Without hesitation, Skinner shoots Modell when he sees a gun in Modell's hand, but once he is on the ground Skinner sees that his hand is curled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of the gun.|$|E

5|$|Myriostoma is a fungal genus in {{the family}} Geastraceae. The genus is monotypic, {{containing}} the single species Myriostoma coliforme. It is an earthstar, so named because the spore-bearing sack's outer wall splits open <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of a star. The inedible fungus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and {{has been found in}} Africa, Asia, North and South America, and Europe, where it grows in humus-rich forests or in woodlands, especially on well-drained and sandy soils. A somewhat rare fungus, it appears on the Red Lists of 12 European countries, and in 2004 it was one of 33 species proposed for protection under the Bern Convention by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{dissection}} puzzle {{similar to}} a Tangram, and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the Archimedes Palimpsest. Archimedes calculates {{the areas of the}} 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a square. Research published by Dr. Reviel Netz of Stanford University in 2003 argued that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could be assembled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of a square. Dr. Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a square 17,152 ways. The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and reflection have been excluded. The puzzle represents an example of an early problem in combinatorics.|$|E
5|$|Carbon fibre is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used {{in a number of}} applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.|$|E

5|$|Within {{a week of}} the episode's {{original}} broadcast, {{a copy of a}} desk calendar chronicling all of Ron Swanson's meetings {{from the}} episode was placed on the official Parks and Recreation website. That site also featured three deleted scenes from the episode. In the first, 80-second clip, Leslie and Jessica get into a fight about the gazebo, and Jessica reveals she has trimmed the mansion's historic hedges <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of elephants. The second clip, which lasted one minute, features several more of Ron Swanson's meetings, including one where he tries to literally will a man away with his mind. Andy also tells Ron he accidentally agreed to sell the recreation center to the Quiznos fast food restaurant chain. In the third, 90-second clip, Leslie tries to end Nick Newport Sr.'s birthday party by pulling the plug on the lights, but accidentally disconnects his breathing machine instead.|$|E
5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E

50|$|The Hanging Gardens or Pherozeshah Mehta Gardens, are terraced gardens perched {{at the top}} of Malabar Hill, on {{its western}} side, just {{opposite}} the Kamala Nehru Park. They provide sunset views over the Arabian Sea and feature numerous hedges carved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> of animals. <b>The</b> park was laid out in 1881 by Ulhas Ghapokar over Bombay's main reservoir.|$|R
50|$|In 1725, the hoaxers carved {{fragments}} of limestone <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> of {{animals such as}} lizards, frogs, and spiders on their webs. To some of them, they added inscriptions such as the Hebrew name of God in Latin, Arabic, and Hebrew characters. They planted the stones on Mount Eibelstadt where Beringer frequently went to search for fossils.|$|R

The upper part of the chalice is decorated with cloisonné garnets and turquoises cut <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> of hearts and palmettes.|$|R
25|$|A {{garden was}} laid out in 1818 {{in the north of}} the Amritsar city at the behalf of Shalimar Bagh of Lahore, known as Ram Bagh at the name of Guru Ram Dass. Maharaja devoted his time in this palace in summer days during the visit of Amritsar. It has been {{converted}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of Museum during the 400th years celebrations of Amritsar City. The Museum displays objects connecting to Maharaja Ranjit Singh such as arms and armour, outstanding paintings and centuries old coins, manuscripts, and jewelry.|$|E
25|$|The steel-pan {{is created}} by {{hammering}} a 55-gallon drum to produce the full chromatic range of scale notes. After the drum is hammered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of a concave bowl, individual notes are grooved out into the bowl of the drum. The traditional steel-pan was hammered out by hand, but with the instrument gaining popularity and worldwide demand, manufacturers have experimented with more efficient methods including Spinforming, Flowforming, Aquaforming and Marforming. A typical pan contains 2½ octaves, with each note being a hammered out groove in the pan that produces a distinct note.|$|E
25|$|If an alar {{cartilage}} is missing, either partially or entirely, it is reconstructed with cartilage grafts. The defect of an alar dome, which retains adequate anatomic support-tripod configuration, can {{be corrected}} with an onlay graft harvested {{either from the}} nasal septum or from the conchal cartilage of an ear. The surgeon forms the cartilage graft <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of a shield—its widest margins become the replacement alar domes. Typically, the shield cartilage graft is stacked in two layers, in order to transmit the desired light reflex characteristic of the nasal tip.|$|E

The chains wore <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> rock during rough seas and it has been known as Australia Rock ever since.|$|R
5|$|The {{planting}} was recreated in the 1930s. No {{original plan}} of the renaissance garden survives, although records show fruit was grown in the 17th century. The garden has decorative hedges, trimmed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> of <b>the</b> Scottish thistle, English rose, and French fleur-de-lis. Further planting is clipped into letters, spelling out the two Lindsay family mottoes, Dum Spiro Spero (while I breathe I hope), and Endure Forte (endure firmly).|$|R
25|$|After {{her death}} on the pyre, the woman is finally {{transformed}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of the satimata, an spiritual embodiment of goodness, with her principal concern of being a family protector. Typically, the satimata occurs in the dreams of the family members, teaching for example, the women how to be good pativratas, herself through her sacrifice having proved she was the perfect pativrata. However, although the satimata's intentions are always {{for the good of}} the family, she is not averse to let, for example, children become sick, or the cows' udders wither, if she thinks this is an appropriate lesson to the living wife who had neglected her duties as pativrata.|$|E
25|$|Descending to the basement, he soon {{encounters}} {{the spirits}} of three of Abbot's most famous occupants. Dr. Killjoy (voiced by John Armstrong) was a psychiatrist/surgeon who ran an insane asylum on the island in the 1920s. Obsessed with discovering {{what is wrong with}} Torque, Killjoy appears as an image projected from 16 mm film projectors. Hermes T. Haight (John Patrick Lowrie) was the executioner in Abbot for twenty-seven years, before he committed suicide in the gas chamber. He appears as a green vapor formed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of a human. Hermes is determined to drive Torque into unleashing the evil inside him. Horace P. Gauge (John Armstrong) was an inmate who was executed in the electric chair for murdering his wife during a conjugal visit. Full of guilt for his actions, he claims Carnate drove him to it, and wants to help Torque realize his decency. He appears in the form of electricity. They teach Torque how to unleash the anger inside himself and transform into a powerful monster, although the transformation is only in Torque's mind.|$|E
25|$|The {{old town}} is centred on the {{marketplace}} and the adjoining streets of Bridge Street, Wrawby Street, and Bigby Street. The marketplace and Wrawby Street, {{where much of the}} town's retail is located, were pedestrianized in the early 1990s. A significant number of buildings in the town centre date to the late 1700s or early 1800s and are listed, with the old town as a whole designated a Conservation Area. The marketplace is dominated by the Buttercross and , a former coaching inn with an early mock Tudor façade, which is now home to Brigg Town Council and various North Lincolnshire Council services. Another former coaching inn, the Exchange, stands in Bigby Street, opposite the former manor house of the Elwes family. The Anglican church of Saint John the Evangelist, built in 1843, also lies on Bigby Street. Its style is of the Gothic Revival architecture popular at the time, but Pevsner notes the curious construction where the stone has first been carved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of bricks before being laid in courses.|$|E
