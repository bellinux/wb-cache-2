5|$|At the 1967 Interzonal, held at Sousse, Tunisia, Fischer scored 8½ {{points in}} the first 10 games, to lead the field. His {{observance}} of the Worldwide Church of God's seventh-day Sabbath was <b>honored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> organizers, but deprived Fischer of several rest days, which led to a scheduling dispute, causing Fischer to forfeit two games in protest and later withdraw, eliminating himself from the 1969 World Championship cycle. Communications difficulties with the highly inexperienced local organizers were also a significant factor, since Fischer knew little French and the organizers had very limited English.
