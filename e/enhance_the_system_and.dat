40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} sharing in collaborative design {{by the use of}} an original system developed in the LUCID-ULg Lab. The Distributed Collaborative Design Studio (DCDS) is a remote workspace environment aiming to emulate, at a distance, the conditions of face-to-face meetings. It is designed to allow designers to interact collaboratively at distance on a shared workspace, thanks to «natural» pen-based interaction. This documents sharing and real-time collaborative annotations are supposed to enhance awareness and grounding dur- ing collaboration in design domains. In this chapter, we explicit the theoretical rationale for sharing in collaborative design, briefly describe the DCDS, summarize the observations we made relative to resources sharing (plans, pictures, documents and so on), and conclude on the theoretical and methodological issues to be addressed to deepen our knowledge about sharing external representations in design, to <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> to adapt it to other contexts.

40|$|Alpha {{particle}} emission, even at {{extremely low}} levels, {{is a significant}} issue {{in the search for}} rare events (e. g., double beta decay, dark matter detection). Traditional measurement techniques require long counting times to measure low sample rates in the presence of much larger instrumental backgrounds. To address this, a commercially available instrument developed by XIA uses pulse shape analysis to discriminate alpha emissions produced by the sample from those produced by other surfaces of the instrument itself. Experience with this system has uncovered two residual sources of background: cosmogenics and radon emanation from internal components. A development program is underway to <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> extend the pulse shape analysis technique further, so that these residual sources can be identified and rejected as well. In this paper, we review the theory of operation and pulse shape analysis techniques used in XIA`s alpha counter, and briefly explore data suggesting the origin of the residual background terms. We will then present our approach to enhance the system`s ability to identify and reject these terms. Finally, we will describe a prototype system that incorporates our concepts and demonstrates their feasibility. Comment: 8 pages, 13 figures, presented at LRT- 201...|$|E

40|$|The {{specific}} requirements of UAV-photogrammetry necessitate particular solutions for system development, which have mostly been ignored or not assessed adequately in recent studies. Accordingly, {{this paper presents}} the methodological and experimental aspects of correctly implementing a UAV-photogrammetry system. The hardware of the system consists of an electric-powered helicopter, a high-resolution digital camera and an inertial navigation system. The software of the system includes the in-house programs specifically designed for camera calibration, platform calibration, system integration, on-board data acquisition, flight planning and on-the-job self-calibration. The detailed features of the system are discussed, and solutions are proposed in order to <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> its photogrammetric outputs. The developed system is extensively tested for precise modeling of the challenging environment of an open-pit gravel mine. The accuracy of the results is evaluated under various mapping conditions, including direct georeferencing and indirect georeferencing with different numbers, distributions and types of ground control points. Additionally, the effects of imaging configuration and network stability on modeling accuracy are assessed. The experiments demonstrated that 1. 55 m horizontal and 3. 16 m vertical absolute modeling accuracy could be achieved via direct geo-referencing, which was improved to 0. 4 cm and 1. 7 cm after indirect geo-referencing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Mobile {{users are}} {{increasing}} fast in numbers, {{new types of}} services and applications become available, and new mobile systems (e. g., for intelligent transportation) emerge. Meanwhile, the need for securing communication in such large scale, highly dynamic systems grows. But the organizational complexity and operational costs make traditional security solutions hard to deploy at the rate new mobile applications are rolled out. The challenge that lies ahead is how to provide versatile security compatible with the large deployed mobile networking infrastructure. We propose a novel approach to establish cryptographic keys. Our basic observation is that users are often very mobile and, as they interact with the infrastructure, each of them can leave a unique trace behind. Unlike many works that seek to identify structure in the mobility of a population, we leverage the inherent randomness of the mobility of individuals (and thus the randomness of mobile-infrastructure interactions) to establish shared secret keys between each mobile node and the infrastructure. With an underlying readily available source of uncertainty, such keys can be generated as needed, on the fly, to <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> user security in many ways. We find that with no or little change to existing mobile communication systems, users can generate a common secret with the infrastructure {{at a rate of}} roughly 0. 1 bits per second. I...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, {{hydrogen}} peroxide has emerged as an environmentally viable alternative in many oxidative processes. This oxidant {{does not require the}} use of a co-reductant and in the presence of non-toxic, inexpensive metals, such as iron, effects homogeneous liquid phase oxidations, producing water as the sole by-product. This "green" combination represents a highly desirable solution to the environmental issue. Following these guidelines, hydrogen peroxide was chosen as terminal oxidant for the oxidation of unreactive substrates and for the oxidative cleavage of double bonds. This thesis work was therefore divided in three sections. In the first part an iron-catalysed oxidation system for saturated hydrocarbons, using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant, has been developed, providing a promising tool for large-scale applications. The method exhibited great advantages: the reaction proceeds under truly catalytic conditions, the catalyst does not require any ligand, and water is the only by-product formed. The presence of an additive, i. e. a carboxylic acid, was found to <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> the effect of different acids was studied. To extend the scope of the reaction, several substrates were tested, such as arylalkanes, cycloalkanes and alcohols. Arylalkanes were easily converted into the corresponding ketones with excellent selectivities and the less reactive and more challenging cycloalkanes gave the corresponding alcohols and ketones with yields comparable to the best reported in literature so far. The system presented peculiar selectivity parameters that are consistent with the involvement of both alkylhydroperoxide or of Fe(OOH) species. In situ IR studies were then conducted to elucidate some mechanistic aspects. In the second part, the applicability of the Fe(ClO 4) 2 /CH 3 COOH/H 2 O 2 system to the oxidative cleavage of double bonds was demonstrated. The reaction conditions were studied and optimised, showing that the presence of an additive, namely acetic acid, is essential to enhance the feature of the system. Substrates with various substitution pattern were considered, revealing a limitation of the applicability of the protocol to alpha,alpha-disubstituted styrenes, which were easily and selectively transformed into the corresponding acetophenone derivatives in good yields. The third part of this thesis was dedicated to the synthesis and application of new chiral C 1 -symmetric triazacyclononanes. Amino acids were chosen as readily available source of chirality and the Crab-like methodology proved to be the ideal synthetic approach, granting the desired flexibility. Transition metal complexes of triazazcyclononanes are known to be efficient and selective catalyst for the CH oxidation of unreactive substrate using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. The new C 1 -symmetric TACNs were employed in the Mn- and Fe-catalysed oxidation of ethylbenzene with H 2 O 2 as oxidant and acetic acid as additive. Although only low conversions were obtained when iron was used as metal source, the system proved to be able of transferring the chiral information into the catalytic process, thus representing the first example of enantioselective CH-activation catalysed by in situ formed iron-TACN complexes. The chiral C 1 -symmetric TACN demonstrated activity also in the enantioselective Mn- catalysed epoxidation of simple olefins, with moderate to good conversions and modest ee. A second approach towards the enantioselective CH oxidation of hydrocarbons was also evaluated, using an isolated Mn-TMTACN complex in combination with chiral carboxylic acids...|$|E
