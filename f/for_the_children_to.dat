5|$|The {{publisher}} of paperbacks, Penguin Books, introduced {{a range of}} books for children under the Puffin Books brand in 1939. At first these were non-fiction titles but these were soon followed by a fiction list of well-known authors. The demand {{was so great that}} Puffin Book Clubs were introduced in schools to encourage reading, and a children's magazine Puffin Post was established. There is a tradition on the Icelandic island of Heimaey <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> rescue young puffins, a fact recorded in Bruce McMillan's photo-illustrated children's book Nights of the Pufflings (1995). The fledglings emerge from the nest and try to {{make their way to the}} sea but sometimes get confused, perhaps by the street lighting, ending up by landing in the village. The children collect them and liberate them to the safety of the sea.|$|E
5|$|Wesley, aware the Enterprise is in orbit, {{arranges}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> passively resist. When the Aldeans request Picard's help {{to resolve}} the issue with the children, the crew finds a way to beam through the shield, allowing Commander Riker and Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) to sneak onto the planet. Data manages to disable the Custodian, disrupting the Aldean's transporter and planetary shield. Dr. Crusher explains to the Aldeans that their shield has weakened the ozone layer of their planet, exposing the inhabitants to ultraviolet radiation that has left them unable to bear children. The radiation would likely have the same effects on the children from the Enterprise. Without the planetary shield, the ozone layer will naturally return, allowing the Aldeans to reproduce again. The Aldeans recognize the error of their ways and return the children to the Enterprise. They accept Starfleet's help to correct their ancient systems and recognize that they will have to forgo their invisibility to continue their society.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Azhar's support, {{the uniform}} {{legislation}} triggered enormous debate {{and resulted in}} a spate of lawsuits. Parents argued that wearing the hijab or niqƒÅb is a religious freedom <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> wear {{what they want to}} wear.|$|E

25|$|Lily {{tells the}} family she is leaving Limerick House. She really makes {{off with the}} mirror, in 1867; Ned Kelly steals Constance's. Ned places the mirror in a bank vault; and Lily aligns hers in the twentieth century. She then goes through the mirror to steal the money. It's a race against time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> {{retrieve}} the mirror and foil the greedy duo.|$|E
25|$|This work is chiefly {{remarkable}} {{because in}} some places it seems to recommend parents not to bequeath anything to their children, on the plea {{that it is better}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> suffer want in this world than that their parents should be damned in the next (iii. 4). Salvian is very clear on the duty of absolute self-denial in the case of sacred virgins, priests and monks (ii. 8-10).|$|E

50|$|Modern playpens are {{portable}} {{and typically}} {{consist of a}} basic metal and plastic support system and mesh, soft plastic or nylon sides. An optional removable bassinet can be attached at <b>the</b> top <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> sleep in or be changed in until four months of age. Some models have attachments such as mobiles, side pockets for supplies and toys, change table attachment, night lights, music boxes, and clip-on adapter for CD player <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> listen to music while sleeping or playing. Portable playpens come in different sizes, but most {{are expected to be}} collapsed into a small roll for easy storage and transport. Difference between playpen and playard is small.|$|R
30|$|Loss of lumbar {{lordosis}} following spine surgery {{can be a}} major impairment to walking, or even sitting, if the hip extensors {{are weak}} since {{there will be no}} way <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> lean back sufficiently to get the mass of the trunk posterior to the hip joints.|$|R
25|$|Remi Cadoret {{wrote in}} the American Journal of Psychiatry that the typical age <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> start talking about past-life {{memories}} (and often violent deaths) was two to four years, and generally they had stopped talking about them {{by the age of}} eight years. The descriptions would sometimes be accompanied by unusual behavior such as specific fears, and the children might have a birthmark the same shape as wounds on the body of the deceased person whose life was purportedly being recalled. The children claiming to have lived before might exhibit special skills, such as playing an instrument or speaking a language they appeared not to have learned.|$|E
25|$|In the 9th century, some European Jewish {{communities}} {{assigned a}} special {{reading from the}} Prophets to be read on this day. In the 14th century, the reading of Genesis was added immediately upon the completion of Deuteronomy and the Shulhan Arukh (written about 1565) only mentions this without mentioning the presumably later custom of southern European countries to remove all the Torah scrolls from the ark and to sing a separate hymn for each one. In northern European countries, those who had finished the reading of Deuteronomy made donations to the synagogue, after which the wealthier {{members of the community}} would give a dinner for friends and acquaintances. By the end of the 15th century, it was a common though not universal practice <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> tear down and burn the sukkahs on Simhat Torah.|$|E
500|$|On 29 April 2007, a Jack Russell named George saved five {{children}} at a carnival in New Zealand from an attack by two pit bulls. He {{was reported to have}} charged at them and held them at bay long enough <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> get away. Killed by the pit bulls, he was posthumously awarded the PDSA Gold Medal in 2009, the animal equivalent of the George Cross. A statue has been erected in Manaia, New Zealand in his memory. [...] A former US Marine also donated to George's owner a Purple Heart award he had received for service in Vietnam.|$|E
50|$|It {{has also}} been {{observed}} that people with the condition have difficulties communicating.

50|$|If {{the parent}} chooses <b>to</b> wait <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> die, then <b>the</b> parent {{will receive the}} exit code of the program that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> executed. <b>To</b> prevent <b>the</b> <b>child</b> {{becoming}} a zombie the parent should call wait on its children, either periodically or upon receiving the SIGCHLD signal, which indicates a child process has terminated.|$|R
500|$|There {{are some}} {{inherent}} criticisms to joint physical custody. A {{criticism of the}} joint physical custody arrangement is that {{due to the nature}} of the arrangement, the parents are in frequent contact with each other than in other situations, leading to conflict which has the potential to negatively impact all parties involved, including the children. Research does not support this concern. Numerous studies found that parents with joint physical custody had lower levels of conflict. There are numerous opinions that the constant moving back and forth between two homes will have a negative impact on children emotionally. The feeling that there is [...] "Mom's House" [...] and [...] "Dad's House" [...] doesn't leave anywhere <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> feel is [...] "my home".|$|E
500|$|After {{the king}} withdrew, the exultant crowd {{would not be}} denied the same accord from the queen, and her {{presence}} was demanded loudly. Lafayette {{brought her to the}} same balcony, accompanied by her young son and daughter. The crowd ominously shouted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> be taken away, and it seemed the stage might be set for a regicide. Yet, as the queen stood with her hands crossed over her chest, the crowd ‚Äì some of whom had muskets leveled in her direction ‚Äì warmed to her courage. Amid this unlikely development, Lafayette cannily let the mob's fury drain away until, with dramatic timing and flair, he knelt reverently and kissed her hand. The demonstrators responded with a muted respect, and many even raised a cheer which the queen had not heard for quite a long time: [...] "Vive la Reine!" ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1938 Jeremy went to Cothill House, {{a school}} in Oxfordshire that {{prepared}} boys for entry to Eton. By summer 1939 war looked likely, and the Thorpe family moved from London to the Surrey village of Limpsfield where Jeremy attended a local school. [...] War began in September 1939; in June 1940, with invasion threatening, the Thorpe children were sent {{to live with their}} American aunt, Kay Norton-Griffiths, in Boston. In September that year Jeremy began at The Rectory School in Pomfret, Connecticut. He remained there for three generally happy years; his main extracurricular task, he later recalled, was looking after the school's pigs. In 1943 it was thought safe <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> return to England, and John Henry used his political connections to secure for Jeremy a passage in the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Phoebe.|$|E
25|$|On 8 May 2005, <b>the</b> Minister <b>for</b> Citizenship {{announced}} a policy change <b>to</b> require all <b>child</b> applicants for grant of Australian citizenship by adoption {{to hold an}} adoption visa, or other permanent visa. However, {{it does not appear}} that there is any requirement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> be physically resident in Australia.|$|R
25|$|Through {{the course}} of the Middle Ages names derived from Christian Saints became more common than Germanic ones. From the 12th century onwards it became custom <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> receive a Christian name, {{although}} some names of Germanic origin like Gertrude and Hubertus remained prevalent as these too became names of Christian saints.|$|R
30|$|A teacher {{intends to}} teach the {{sentence}} ‚ÄúI go to school‚Äù to a girl with Farsi as her L 1. The problem that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> may encounter is that, unlike English, Farsi is a pro-drop language. Therefore, the grammatical emotion needs <b>to</b> be engendered <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> realize that <b>the</b> pronoun is non-removable in the English language.|$|R
500|$|Smith began {{publishing}} {{for children}} in 1887, with her first volume of children's music entitled Songs for Little Children, Part 1. She was a proponent and follower of the teaching philosophy of Friedrich Fr√∂bel. Smith incorporated Fr√∂bel's ideas that childhood is a universal experience in which children learn by imitation, using their natural abilities. Her compositions also recognized that children learn by movement and play, but have limited attention spans. Thus, the compositions she created were usually short melodies, with limited vocal ranges, and were easy to sing. The songs were in major keys, typically C, F, and G and extended only from C1 to F2. Most melodies were made in stepped triads and provided pauses for activity. For example, in her song [...] "The Wind Mill" [...] there is an eight measure rest <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> make the motions of the turning blades.|$|E
500|$|The school {{moved to}} its final {{location}} in 1917, at Vanderlip Hall, a building Vanderlip constructed in 1916 bordering Albany Post Road (current U.S. Route 9). The building {{was designed for}} classes of ten, to accommodate 120 children total. It was situated on Beechwood's [...] parkland designed by Frederick Law Olmsted for the Vanderlips. Throughout the school's history, students were open to wander the woodlands and gardens, utilize the lawns and tennis courts, and swim in the Olympic-sized pool. There were always farm animals nearby <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> see and play with and a circus carousel to ride on. The school had a gymnasium class, amateur theater group, folk singing, a swimming pool, and an economic forum. Frank Vanderlip had spent about $500,000 on the school ($ in [...] ). Regular art exhibits were held at the Scarborough School, including a sculpture exhibition in the Italian garden at Beechwood, which included works by Jose de Creeft, Jason Seley (a longtime professor of sculpture at Cornell), and Richard Stankiewicz.|$|E

500|$|There {{has been}} a major shift which is favoring joint custody in the United States court system, which began in the mid-1980s.

50|$|Furthermore, a 2009 {{study by}} Bannard et al. {{showed that a}} {{traditional}} context-free grammar which works probabilistically over individual lexical items was not inferior to a slot-and-frame computational model. One possible interpretation is that the intermediate slot-and-frame stage is not required and that a limited lexical pool is sufficient <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> form abstract NOUN and VERB categories.|$|R
