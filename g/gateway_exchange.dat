Each gateway, that runs a RSA-Key Generations Offline procedure, is controlled according to specific issues and necessaries. This stage is called RSA-Key Generations Offline. We propose the new method for exchanging values of the keys among gateways.

40|$|Delay-tolerant {{networking}} (DTN) is {{an approach}} to computer network architecture that seeks to address the technical issues in heterogeneous networks that may lack continuous network connectivity. Due {{to the lack of}} continuous communications among mobile nodes and possible errors in the estimation of nodal contact probability, convergence and stability become major challenges in distributed clustering in DTMN. Clustering significantly reduces the energy consumption of a cluster. In this paper, a cluster based routing protocol for Delay-Tolerant Mobile Networks (DTMNs) is used. Exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) scheme is employed for on-line updating nodal contact probability, with its mean proven to converge to the true contact probability.

40|$|We {{examine the}} role of the {{vegetation}} cover and the associated hydrological cycle on the deep ocean circulation during the Late Miocene (~ 10 million years ago). In our simulations, an open Central American <b>gateway</b> and <b>exchange</b> with fresh Pacific waters leads to a weak and shallow thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean which is consistent with most other modeling studies for this time period. Here, we estimate the effect of a changed vegetation cover on the ocean general circulation using atmospheric circulation model simulations for the late Miocene climate with 353 ppmv CO 2 level. The Late Miocene land surface cover reduces the albedo, the net evaporation in the North Atlantic catchment is affected and the North Atlantic water becomes more saline leading to a more vigorous North Atlantic Deep Water circulation. These effects reveal potentially important feedbacks between the ocean circulation, the hydrological cycle and the land surface cover for Cenozoic climate evolution...|$|R
50|$|RoS replicators {{are used}} on the remote origin scale. They are {{applications}} run on <b>gateway</b> devices or <b>exchange</b> servers to replicate incoming RoSs from one network type to another. For example, an SMS messaging server would replicate a request sent by text message, to the cluster over a fibre optic computer network. The Replicator has the responsibility of deciding where any response data from the cluster should go. Obviously, large data streams requested in a RoS could not be sent back via text message, therefore the Replicator redirects the data to another location, usually specified by the initial RoS or by a hard coded variable within the application.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Gateway nodes {{are most}} {{important}} in Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) {{as most of the}} traffic is forwarded through them. As a result of this imbalance in the network condition may occur if one gateway becomes overloaded (through which maximum flow is forwarded) and some become underutilized. We propose one Gateway Load Balancing Algorithm (GWLBA) which is a distributed load-balancing protocol where <b>gateways</b> co-ordinate and <b>exchange</b> information about network condition and reroute traffic from congested gateways to underutilized ones. Our approach takes interference into consideration along with load balancing. We have simulated our approach using ns- 2. We have compared our scheme with some other schemes and shown that our scheme is better than them...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{vehicles}} use {{a variety}} of data networks to exchange data between their different control modules. These networks operate at different communication speeds to reflect the relative response times of the connected control units. For example, engine control units are connected to a high-speed network while comfort systems such as electric seats are connected to a low speed network. In addition, {{there are a number of}} different network operating principles, for example, event-driven and timetriggered. Gateways are required to exchange data between these different vehicle networks. <b>Gateways</b> typically <b>exchange</b> messages between connected networks based solely on the destination and priority of the messages. Such gateways can result in unpredictable message delays depending on the network loading and vehicle operating conditions. The aim of this research is to develop and evaluate a vehicle network gateway model based on a very general and well designed gateway structure from the automotive industry, which takes into account factors such as the purpose of network messages, vehicle operating conditions, network loading, bus topology and message streams. The network gateway model is used to evaluate the relative performance of different gateway configurations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose a {{complete}} solution of authentication and key exchange for digital home environments such that mobile devices can securely access the home devices. Some digital home authentication and key exchange protocols performed between mobile devices and home gateways are assisted by the AAA servers, which are provided by telecommunication companies, but they have some security flaws. In our proposed protocol, the necessary security requirements for digital home security mechanisms are satisfied, such as mutual authentication, authenticated key exchange, and forward secrecy. In our digital home security scheme, a mobile device can authenticate his home <b>gateway</b> and <b>exchange</b> a session key with each home device without pre-sharing keys with the home gateway and with the home device. The proposed authentication and key exchange protocol can also cooperate with the AAA server. Furthermore, we propose another authentication and key exchange protocol with forward secrecy between mobile devices and home devices. The computation capabilities of the mobile devices also are considered in our proposed protocols, where we only employ symmetric encryption/decryption and low-cost operations in order to reach the aim of light-weight computation cost...|$|R
