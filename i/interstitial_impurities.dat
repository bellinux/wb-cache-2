40|$|The {{diffusion}} equation for nonequilibrium <b>interstitial</b> <b>impurity</b> atoms {{taking into}} account their charge states and drift of all mobile interstitial species in the built-in electric field and {{in the field of}} elastic stress was obtained. The obtained generalized equation is equivalent to the set of diffusion equations written for the <b>interstitial</b> <b>impurity</b> atoms in each individual charge state. Due to a number of the characteristic features the generalized equation is more convenient for numerical solution than the original system of separate diffusion equations. On this basis, the macroscopic description of stress-mediated impurity diffusion due to a kick-out mechanism was obtained. It is supposed that the <b>interstitial</b> <b>impurity</b> atom makes a number of jumps before conversion to the substitutional position. At the same time, a local equilibrium prevails between substitutionally dissolved impurity atoms, nonequilibrium self-interstitials, and <b>interstitial</b> <b>impurity</b> atoms. Also, the derived equation for impurity diffusion due to the kick-out mechanism takes into account all charge states of <b>interstitial</b> <b>impurity</b> atoms as well as drift of interstitial species in the electric field and in the field of elastic stress. Moreover, this equation exactly matches the equation of stress-mediated impurity diffusion due to generation, migration, and dissociation of the equilibrium pairs "impurity atom - self-interstitial".

To illustrate the latter cases, a model of nitrogen diffusion in gallium arsenide was developed and simulation of nitrogen redistribution from a doped epi-layer during thermal annealing of GaAs substrate was done.

50|$|Certain {{minerals}} occasionally contain <b>interstitial</b> <b>impurities</b> {{of radioactive}} elements, {{and it is}} the alpha radiation emitted from those compounds that is responsible for degrading a mineral's crystal structure through internal bombardment. The effects of metamictization are extensive: other than negating any birefringence previously present, the process also lowers a mineral's refractive index, hardness, and its specific gravity. The mineral's colour is also affected: metamict specimens are usually green, brown or blackish. Further, metamictization diffuses the bands of a mineral's absorption spectrum. Curiously and inexplicably, the one attribute which metamictization does not alter is dispersion. All metamict materials are themselves radioactive, some dangerously so.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the Green {{function}} method, analytical solutions of the diffusion equation which describes nonstationary migration of nonequilibrium <b>interstitial</b> <b>impurity</b> atoms have been derived. It is supposed that the initial distribution of nonequilibrium <b>impurity</b> <b>interstitials</b> is formed due to ion implantation and, therefore, is described by the Gaussian function. The condition of the constant concentration of <b>impurity</b> <b>interstitials</b> (the Dirichlet boundary condition) or reflecting boundary condition was imposed on the surface of a semiconductor. The Dirichlet boundary condition was also enforced for the concentration of <b>impurity</b> <b>interstitials</b> in the infinity, i. e., in the bulk of a semiconductor. On {{the basis of}} the solutions derived the redistribution of ion-implanted boron in silicon substrate during low-temperature thermal treatment has been simulated. The calculated profile of boron atoms after annealing agrees well with experimental data.

It is supposed that nonequilibrium boron interstitials are generated {{either in the}} course of ion implantation or at the initial stage of thermal treatment and that they migrate inward and to the surface of a semiconductor in the basic stage of annealing.

In the case of welding, <b>interstitial</b> <b>impurities</b> are introduced in the welding process from the atmosphere and by dissolution of existing precipitates in the alloy itself. Because of the necessity of having an ultra-pure atmosphere, a vacuum chamber or a glove box is necessary. In the V-Cr-Ti system, the titanium serves as a getter to control the concentration of oxygen and nitrogen in solid solution in the alloy.

Mechanical integrity of the welds was determined by Charpy V-notch testing. Welds were prepared by the gas-tungsten-arc (GTA) method. Charpy testing established a correlation between weld impurity concentration and the ductile to brittle transition temperature (DBTT). Higher concentrations of oxygen resulted in a higher DBTT.
