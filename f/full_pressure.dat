2500|$|Kelly Johnson, {{founder of}} Lockheed Skunk Works, and {{developer}} of the U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird family of spy planes, commented on escape crew capsules when discussing {{development of the}} YF-12A (Blackbird) ejection seat: [...] "We set ourselves a very high goal in providing crew escape systems. We were determined to develop a system good for zero escape velocity {{on the ground and}} through the complete flight spectrum, having speeds above Mach 3 at 100,000 feet. We did achieve our design goals.... I have never been convinced that a capsule ejection is required for anything other than high velocity re-entry from outer space. Our escape system in a very important sense really provides a capsule, which is the pressure suit, which is surely capable of meeting the speeds and temperatures likely to be encountered in the near future of manned aircraft." [...] Rather than using escape capsules, SR-71 and U-2 pilots wore <b>full</b> <b>pressure</b> suits for high-altitude ejections.

[...] Prior to 1954, the 235 and 216 cubic inch six cylinder engines had babbit bearings and scoops to create oil pressure at the bottom of each rod and the oil pressure was standard at 15-30 PSI.

25|$|The {{position}} of the equilibrium in the carbamate formation/decomposition depends on {{the product of the}} partial pressures of the reactants. In the total recycle processes, carbamate decomposition is promoted by reducing the overall pressure, which reduces the partial pressure of both ammonia and carbon dioxide. It is possible, however, to achieve a similar effect without lowering the overall pressure—by suppressing the partial pressure of just one of the reactants. Instead of feeding carbon dioxide gas directly to the reactor with the ammonia, as in the total recycle process, the stripping process first routes the carbon dioxide through a stripper (a carbamate decomposer that operates under <b>full</b> system <b>pressure</b> and configured to provide maximum gas-liquid contact). This flushes out free ammonia, reducing its partial pressure over the liquid surface and carrying it directly to a carbamate condenser (also under <b>full</b> system <b>pressure).</b> From there, reconstituted ammonium carbamate liquor passes directly to the reactor. That eliminates the medium-pressure stage of the total recycle process altogether.|$|R
