40|$|Workers with {{difficult}} working conditions {{can be expected}} to be com-pensated by higher wages. They may, for example, choose shift work because of compensating wages but {{it is also possible that}} they prefer shift work. The previous empirical evidence is mixed. We study if there are compensating wages for shift work by estimating a switching regression model with endogenous switching using French matched employer–employee data for male full time blue collar workers. It is crucial to adjust for selectivity and not to pool data for shift and day workers. A main result is that there is a significant <b>shift</b> <b>premium,</b> the wage rate for shift workers is 16 percent higher than for day workers. A second main result is that the <b>shift</b> <b>premium</b> is significant for shift work choice. This premium compensates workers who do not self–select into shift work. A 1 percentage point increase in the <b>premium</b> increases the <b>shift</b> work probability by 0. 87 percentage points. shift work premium; compensating wage differentials; switching regression model with endogenous switching...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} there are two major {{explanations}} to why Swedish forward interest rates have been high and volatile: (i) Investors' fears that the economy will switch to a high inflation regime give rise to a regime <b>shift</b> <b>premium.</b> (ii) Expectations of monetary policy actions amplify the effect on forward interest rates originating from fluctuations in inflation expectations. In an empirical investigation the quantitative importance of adjusting forward interest rates for regime shift premia is demonstrated. In a second step it is shown that an one percentage point increase of the one year forward interest rate (adjusted for the regime <b>shift</b> <b>premium)</b> only corresponds to an increase of investors' inflation expectations (obtained from surveys) by approximately 0. 2 percentage points, suggesting {{that the rest of the}} forward interest rate movement reflects expectations of future increases of the future real short term interest rate, i. e. a tightening of monetary policy. Finally, there is evidence that investors' inflation expectations from 4 to 2 percent mainly is due to a decrease of the regime shift premiu...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} causes of the {{dramatic}} rise in employee contributions to health insurance over the past two decades. In 1982, 44 % of those who were covered by their employer-provided health insurance had their costs fully financed by their employer, but by 1998 this had fallen to 28 %. We discuss the theory of why employers might <b>shift</b> <b>premiums</b> to their employees, and empirically model the role of four factors suggested by the theory. We find that there was a large impact of falling tax rates, rising eligibility for insurance through the Medicaid system, rising medical costs, and increased managed care penetration. Overall, this set of factors can explain more than one-half of the rise in employee premiums over the 1982 – 1996 period...|$|R

30|$|Although OC {{sequences}} have ideal correlation properties, they cannot {{support the}} large number of users since the set size must not be larger than the flock size [2, 5]. To increase the set size of complementary sequence sets, the idea of zero-correlation zone (ZCZ) [6 – 8] or interference-free windows (IFWs) [9, 10] was exploited to the generation of complementary sequences, and generalized pairwise complementary (GPC) sequences [11] with the setwise uniform IFWs were constructed on the basis of complete complementary sequences [12] and generalized <b>even</b> <b>shift</b> orthogonal sequences [13]. Similar to the construction idea of GPC sequences, generalized pairwise Z-complementary (GPZ) sequences were generated in [14]. GPZ sequences are based on generalized <b>even</b> <b>shift</b> orthogonal-like sequences and include GPC sequences as a special case.|$|R
40|$|When {{entering}} {{the job market}} registered nurses (RNs) face job alternatives with differences in wages and other job attributes. Previous studies of the nursing labor market have shown large earnings differences between similar hospital and non-hospital RNs. Corresponding differences are found {{in some of the}} analyses of shift and regular daytime workers. In {{the first part of this}} paper I analyze the wage differentials in the Norwegian public health sector, applying a switching regression model. I find no hospital <b>premium</b> for the <b>shift</b> RNs and a slightly negative hospital premium for the daytime RNs, but it is not significant for the hospital job choice. I find a positive <b>shift</b> <b>premium.</b> The wage rate is 19 % higher for the shift working hospital RNs and 18 % for the sample of primary care workers. The <b>shift</b> <b>premium</b> is only weakly significant for the shift work choice for the sample of hospital RNs, and not for the primary care RNs. I identify some selection effects. In the second part of the paper I focus on the shift compensation only, and present a structural labor supply model with a random utility function. This is done to identify the expected compensating variation necessary for the nurses to remain on the same utility level when they are “forced” from a day job to a shift job. The expected compensating variations are derived by Monte Carlo simulations and presented for different categories of hours. I find that on average the offered combination of higher wages, shorter working hours and increased flexibility overcompensates for the health and social strains related to shift work.

40|$|Background Gastrointestinal (GI) {{complaints}} {{are common in}} shift workers. This study examines the relationship between work schedules and GI symptoms, medications, and diagnoses. Methods In a cross-sectional survey of 343 US auto factory workers, four work schedule variables were examined: assigned shift, number of hours worked, number of night hours, and schedule variability. Multiple regression tested the relationship between GI outcomes and work schedule variables while controlling for covariates. Results The <b>evening</b> <b>shift</b> was associated with more GI symptoms and GI diagnoses. Unexpectedly, more consistent work times were associated with having a GI diagnosis. As schedule variability increased the probability of GI medication use increased in low noise exposure. Conclusion Findings suggest that <b>evening</b> <b>shift</b> and widely varying work start and end times may increase risks for GI disturbances. Am. J. Ind.
