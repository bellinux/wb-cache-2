500|$|The Division Bell {{deals with}} themes of {{communication}} {{and the idea that}} talking can solve many problems. In the Studio radio host Redbeard suggested that the album offered [...] "the very real possibility of transcending it all, through shivering moments of grace". Songs such as [...] "Poles Apart" [...] and [...] "Lost for Words" [...] have been interpreted as references to the estrangement between Pink Floyd and former band member Roger Waters, who left in 1985; however, Gilmour denied this, and said: [...] "People can invent and relate to a song in their personal ways, but it's a little late at this point <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> conjuring Roger up." [...] The title refers to the division bell rung in the British parliament to announce a vote. Drummer Nick Mason said: [...] "It does have some meaning. It's about people making choices, yeas or nays." ...|$|E
500|$|As each {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} new characters, the writers {{were able to}} attract actors {{who may have been}} unwilling to commit to an entire series. The writers' reputation also helped attract writers, with journalist David Chater saying that they [...] "have developed such a track record over the years that many of the finest actors in the country jump at the chance to appear in their dark imaginings". The fact that Pemberton and Shearsmith only played a single character in each story was a change for them; in The League of Gentlemen, the pair have played some 30 characters each, while, in Psychoville, they had played around five each. Though Pemberton and Shearsmith generally starred in each episode, they did not necessarily take on the main roles. Shearsmith explained this by saying that they [...] "didn't write this <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in. We wrote the stories first then thought, could we be in them?" ...|$|E

500|$|Pompeo's second {{contract}} with Grey's Anatomy expired after the eighth season, and speculation arose {{that she would}} be leaving subsequently. [...] In September 2011, Pompeo reported that she is open to the idea of extending her contract, if invited. She told TV Guide: [...] "I would never turn up my nose at [...] As long as the stories are honest and truthful, and Patrick [...] and I feel there is material <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> passionate about, it still beats a 9-to-5 job any day. If I hear from the fans that they want us to keep going, then I would continue because we owe them everything." [...] E! Online reported in May 2012, that Pompeo, as well as all original cast members have signed on for two more years. With the Huffington Post announcement of season nine having officially been renewed, the contract is set into place for Pompeo to return.|$|E
500|$|After the race, it was {{announced}} that the FIA was investigating irregularities with an electronic box in Hakkinen's car. This was due to Formula One's governing body discovering that one mandatory seal was missing. Further samples from the electronic box were taken after the race; this was software downloaded which did not discover any issues with the coding. A spokesman for the McLaren team said that: [...] "No one changed the software, so there's no reason <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worried." [...] At the hearing on 25 July, the FIA ruled that McLaren did not gain an advantage from the missing seal and that Häkkinen's victory would stand. However, McLaren were deducted 10 points from the Constructors' Championship and fined $50,000 for contravening Article 7 of the 2000 Formula One Sporting Regulations, which stated that competitors had to maintain some conditions of safety and eligibility during the event. McLaren International managing director Martin Whitmarsh announced that the team would not appeal the penalty. The Vice-President of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport Norbert Haug later criticised the decision and believed that the seal was never put on Häkkinen's car. Haug also said he would not take any further action regarding the matter.|$|E
500|$|For Wasting Light, Grohl {{stated that}} they {{would go back to}} a rawer and heavier sound after [...] "exploring new musical ground" [...] on the {{previous}} records, adding that [...] "with the last album we were too concerned with being musical, now it's time <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a rock band again". To contrast with the [...] "seven or eight minute-long songs, with seven or eight sections, and two or three time changes" [...] Grohl played with Them Crooked Vultures, he instead tried to compose the [...] "tightest, catchiest four-and-a-half-minute 'softball bat to your face' songs". Hawkins added that he liked Wasting Light for being [...] "straightforward, and that’s a good thing for us right now. The last couple [...] had some big dynamic changes." [...] Grohl described the effort as their heaviest yet, later saying it was done because [...] "I'm 42 now. I don't know if I'm {{going to be able to}} make this record when I'm 46 or 49. It's my last chance." [...] While the demos that prompted Grohl to say the album would be their heaviest yet were not used on the album, Vig took the declarations to heart, following three criteria while recording: [...] "It's got to be hooky, heavy, and we're going analog all the way." ...|$|E

500|$|Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe {{said that}} [...] "Bally's in Las Vegas set the Red Sox as 8–5 {{favorites}} {{to win the}} Series" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "some sentiment in St. Louis that the NL champions have been disrespected." [...] but also that Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein [...] "Did not want to dis the Cardinals." [...] Shaughnessy also quoted Schilling as having said: [...] "There's a lot of good players in that [...] clubhouse over there. This isn't the time <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thinking about history. If we get three wins and 26 outs into the fourth win, I'm pretty sure it will hit us." [...] Before the series began, Shaughnessy wrote a piece saying that although the Red Sox had beaten the Yankees, the series needed to be won, as {{it was the only way}} the Curse of the Bambino, which he had publicized based on the book of the same title in 1990, would end, and demeaning chants of [...] "1918!" [...] would no longer echo at Yankee Stadium. During the series, he wrote a piece about how much people in New England were thinking about loved ones who had spent their entire lives rooting for the Red Sox, hoping that one day, they would see their Red Sox win a World Series.|$|E
2500|$|Barron {{expressed}} resentment {{towards the}} Democratic Party, saying {{it had taken}} African-Americans for granted: [...] "It's time <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> for us. It's time <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a self-determining people." [...] Barron aimed to get 50,000 votes in the governor's race, enough to gain ballot access for the party, but ended up with 24,560 votes out of over 3,000,000 cast. More than 75% of the votes cast for Barron originated in New York City.|$|E

2500|$|When A {{announced}} {{the cancellation of}} Nero Wolfe in August 2002, the network took {{the unusual step of}} posting an [...] "Important Message" [...] on its website: [...] "We at A remain extremely proud of Nero Wolfe. It is a high quality, beautifully produced and entertaining show, unlike anything else currently on the television landscape. Although it performed moderately well amongst tough competition for two seasons, it simply did not do well enough <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to go on making it, given the current television climate." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{report said}} that {{explanations}} including Labour being [...] "anti-business" [...] or [...] "anti-aspiration" [...] were not [...] "significant" [...] factors, saying that [...] "reasons for defeat {{should be treated}} with caution and require deeper analysis". Allegations that the party was overly left wing were also allegedly unfounded, as according to the report: [...] "Many of our most 'left wing' polices were the most popular. Polls showed a wish, from voters, <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tougher on big business, and policies that were unpopular with many senior business people, such as the energy price freeze and the Mansion Tax, were popular with voters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vang {{argued that}} the use of the Hmong people did not seem {{relevant}} to the overall plot. He said [...] "there is no real reason <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Hmong in the script" [...] and that even though Walt Kowalski had fought in Korea, he had still confused the Hmong with Koreans and other Asian ethnic groups.s Hmong Lead Bee Vang on Film, Race and Masculinity Conversations with Louisa Schein, Spring, 2010." [...] p. 6. In a 2011 program Vang said that Hmong actors were treated unfairly on the set, and that Eastwood did not give tips on how to build the characters. Vang also said that other white cast members made Hmong actors feel excluded. Vang said that some important lines that the Hmong characters said in the Hmong language were not subtitled, so audiences developed a skewed perception of the Hmong people.|$|E

If I'm skeptical, it's not about now, but about the distant future. We are {{separated}} for too long at a time <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bound together forever. There's something hopeless and very sad about this feeling. You asked me about a child, and I said what I did because I'm not thinking that far ahead—because a child is the most wonderful creation and the final bond {{between a man and}} a woman (at least, that's how I see it, or let's say, that's how it should be and how I'd want it to be). And I'm not thinking that far ahead because I'm not convinced it's eternal. I only wish I could free myself of this doubt." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his {{liberation of}} Paris speech, de Gaulle argued [...] "It {{will not be}} enough that, with the help of our dear and admirable Allies, we have got rid of him [...] from our home <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{satisfied}} after what happened. We want to enter his territory as it should be, as victors", clearly showing his ambition that France be considered one of the World War II victors just like the Big Three. This perspective was not shared by the western Allies, as was demonstrated in the German Instrument of Surrender's First Act. The French occupation zones in Germany and in West Berlin cemented this ambition, leading to some frustration on the part of other European nations, which became part of the deeper Western betrayal sentiment. This sentiment was felt by other European Allies, especially Poland, whose proposition that they be part of the occupation of Germany was rejected by the Soviets; the latter taking the view that they had liberated the Poles from the Nazis which thus put them {{under the influence of the}} USSR.|$|E
2500|$|The general {{consensus}} of modern scholars is that Mark {{was the first}} gospel to be written and dates from no earlier than c.65 AD, while Matthew and Luke, which {{use it as a}} source, were written between 80/85 AD. The composition history of John is complex, but most scholars see it taking place in stages beginning as early as before 70 AD and extending as late {{as the end of the}} century. None of the authors were eyewitnesses to the life of Jesus, nor did they receive their information directly from eyewitnesses. Mythicist Richard Carrier is thus in agreement with mainstream scholarship when he states: [...] "The Gospels cannot really be dated, nor are the real authors known. Their names were assigned early, but not early enough <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> confident they were accurately known. It is based on speculation that Mark was the first, written between AD 60 and 70, Matthew second, between AD 70 and 80, Luke (and Acts) third, between AD 80 and 90, and John last, between AD 90 and 100".|$|E

[...] Several other Australian venues followed suit soon afterward, which led Meryl Dorey of anti-vaccination lobby group the Australian Vaccination-Skeptics Network to compare opponents of Tenpenny's visits to Australia to the perpetrators of the Charlie Hebdo shooting. By January 19, all eight venues at which Tenpenny was originally scheduled to speak had cancelled her seminars. Virologist David Hawkes responds to the cancellation of the lecture series by saying it [...] "was a win for people who were concerned about public health...." [...] "It's been driven by parents generally at a community level who were concerned about the emergence of diseases like whooping cough {{in the last few years}} due to less than ideal vaccination rates."

2500|$|The Gamemakers' control center, {{about which}} Katniss can only {{speculate}} in the novel, was also developed as a location, helping to remind the audience of the artificial nature of the arena. Ross commented, [...] "so much of the film happens in the woods that it's easy to forget this is a futuristic society, manipulating these events {{for the sake of}} an audience. The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room." [...] Ross and visual effects supervisor Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal dei ex machina Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that [...] "we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [...] that just appear {{at the end of the}} movie? We wanted to find a way to introduce them without having to explain specifically and exactly what they were and the game room was a really great opportunity <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to do that." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{discussing}} {{the qualities of}} Byron's poetry in comparison with how Verdi treated it musically, Julian Budden points to one obvious problem: the opera [...] "hardly makes for music-drama [...] it is a narrative. [...] Not being conceived of in dramatic terms it offers no opportunity for the generation of musical power through conflict and clash of personalities." [...] He compares it unfavourably with [...] "the steady crescendo of dramatic interest" [...] in Ernani, or the [...] "cut and thrust of character dialectic that informs I due Foscari and [...] "without the sense of grand theatre that transfigures the great moments in Giovanna d'Arco and Attila. David Kimball (in Holden) [...] also describes it in comparable terms, emphasizing that [...] "after the weightiness of the three previous three operas [...] seems a light, sketchy piece." [...] But he does note that Verdi was [...] "designing arias more imaginatively". Of interest is the caution given by Roger Parker <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aware that the dramatic structure of the opera was finalized in 1846, before Macbeth, and therefore {{this might be a}} reason for regarding the opera as old-fashioned.|$|E
