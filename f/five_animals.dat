500|$|In 1979, the Piedmontese Breeding Co-operative, Ltd. of Saskatchewan, Canada (PBL Co-op of Canada) began {{preparations}} {{to import}} the first Piedmontese cattle into North America. There had been prior attempts at importation of the breed by the PBL Co-op of Canada and other cattle breeders, but the Italian Association {{was reluctant to}} sell any of their purebred breeding stock. [...] Health protocols also created substantial levels of difficulty. The first successful importation occurred {{in the fall of}} 1979 with the arrival of <b>five</b> <b>animals</b> into Canada. [...] Obtaining authorization and transfers to import the first <b>five</b> <b>animals</b> was the culmination of a half decade of effort, the cost of which is estimated at $100,000 per animal based on 2014 values. [...] The following year, Canada received more Italian imports of Piedmontese cattle, including five more bulls. The next year, Italian imports arrived in the US, including three additional sire lines and two cows. [...] It was from that genetic base that the North American breed of Piedmontese cattle began. [...] In 1983, the Canadian Piedmontese Association (CPA) was formed, followed by the Piedmontese Association of the United States (PAUS) in 1984. [...] By the 1990s, imports of semen and embryos were more substantial. [...] Today there are several bloodlines available to cattle raisers in North America.|$|E
500|$|In {{its first}} years, the zoo hosted a captive {{breeding}} program ("Operation Oryx") {{with the specific}} goal of reintroducing the almost extinct Arabian oryx to the wild. By the early 1990s this program was still {{one of only two}} programs (the other being the golden lion tamarin) to have gone through the full wilderness-zoo-wilderness sequence. Nine oryx had been caught or donated for the breeding program. However, two pairs were delayed, so the [...] "World Herd" [...] was started in Phoenix in 1963 with only <b>five</b> <b>animals</b> shipped to the zoo and two born quickly after. The two delayed pairs arrived in 1964 to increase the herd to 11 individuals. The program was very successful, and the zoo celebrated its 225th Arabian oryx birth in 2002. The Arabian oryx became extinct in the wild in 1972, and reintroduction efforts were started in 1982 when oryx were released to the wild in the Omani Central Desert and Coastal Hills. Additional captive herds have been discovered and used as the basis for reintroductions, for instance in Saudi Arabia, but there has been some interbreeding even with these herds and most of the Arabian oryx in the wild today have ancestors from the Phoenix Zoo.|$|E

60|$|The {{soldiers}} were principally foreigners who had enlisted in our large cities, and, {{with the exception}} of a chance drayman among them, it is not probable that any of the men who reported themselves as competent teamsters had ever driven a mule-team in their lives, or indeed that many had had any previous experience in driving any animal whatever to harness. Numbers together can accomplish what twice their number acting individually could not perform. Five mules were allotted to each wagon. A teamster would select at the picket rope <b>five</b> <b>animals</b> of nearly the same color and general appearance for his team. With a full corps of assistants, other teamsters, he would then proceed to get his mules together. In two's the men would approach each animal selected, avoiding as far as possible its heels. Two ropes would be put about the neck of each animal, with a slip noose, so that he could be choked if too unruly. They were then led out, harnessed by force and hitched to the wagon in the position they had to keep ever after. Two men remained on either side of the leader, with the lassos about its neck, and one man retained the same restraining influence over each of the others. All being ready, the hold would be slackened and the team started. The first motion was generally five mules in the air at one time, backs bowed, hind feet extended to the rear. After repeating this movement a few times the leaders would start to run. This would bring the breeching tight against the mules at the wheels, which these last seemed to regard as a most unwarrantable attempt at coercion and would resist by taking a seat, sometimes going so far as to lie down. In time all were broken in to do their duty submissively if not cheerfully, but there never was a time during the war when it was safe to let a Mexican mule get entirely loose. Their drivers were all teamsters by the time they got through.|$|E
60|$|I now {{proceed to}} {{consider}} more particularly why {{the range of}} deviation from the average is such that we find about one ox out of fifty to possess sufficient independence of character {{to serve as a}} pretty good fore-ox. Why is it not one in five or one in five hundred? The reason undoubtedly is that natural selection tends to give but one leader to each suitably-sized herd, and to repress superabundant leaders. There is a certain size of herd most suitable to the geographical and other conditions of the country; it must not be too large, or the scattered puddles which form their only watering-places for a great part of the year would not suffice; and there are similar drawbacks in respect to pasture. It must not be too small, or it would be comparatively insecure; thus a troop of <b>five</b> <b>animals</b> is far more easy to be approached by a stalking huntsman than one of twenty, and the latter than one of a hundred. We have seen that it is the oxen who graze apart, {{as well as those who}} lead the herd, who are recognised by the trainers of cattle as gifted with enough independence of character to become fore-oxen. They are even preferred to the actual leaders of the herd; they dare to move more alone, and therefore their independence is undoubted. The leaders are safe enough from lions, because their flanks and rear are guarded by their followers; but each of those who graze apart, and who represent the superabundant supply of self-reliant animals, have one flank and the rear exposed, and it is precisely these whom the lions take. Looking at the matter in a broad way, we may justly assert that wild beasts trim and prune every herd into compactness, and tend to reduce it into a closely-united body with a single well-protected leader. That the development of independence of character in cattle is thus suppressed below its otherwise natural standard by the influence of wild beasts, is shown by the greater display of self-reliance among cattle whose ancestry for some generations have not been exposed to such danger.|$|E
