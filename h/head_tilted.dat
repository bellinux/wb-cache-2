40|$|Background: Compensatory ocular counter-torsion (COCT) is {{supposed}} to maintain the eyes aligned with the visual environment following <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> Because of some recent controversies the functional capacity of this phenomenon was defined according {{to the extent of}} induced astigmatic axis error following <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> Materials and Methods: Objective autorefractometry was performed on 70 eyes with a regular astigmatism of ≥ 2 D at vertical, right <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> and left <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> positions of 5 °, 10 °, 15 °, 20 ° and 25 °. Astigmatic axis error was calculated according to the difference between the defined axis at each <b>tilted</b> <b>head</b> position and the defined axis at the vertical head position. A tiltometer was used for this purpose to show the angle of <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> without disturbing the process of refractometry. Results: The mean astigmatic axis error was 3. 2 ° ± 1. 5 ° and 18. 4 ° ± 4. 2 ° at the <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> angles of 5 ° and 25 ° respectively. The mean percentage of tilt angle compensation by COCT was 36 % and 26 % at the <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> angles of 5 ° and 25 ° respectively. There was a direct relation between the <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> angle and the induced astigmatic axis error (ANOVA, P < 0. 001, 95 % of confidence interval [CI]). Astigmatic axis error values at right <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> were significantly lower than their corresponding values at left <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> (ANOVA, P = 0. 04 95 % CI). Conclusion: Any minimal angle of <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> may cause erroneous measurement of astigmatic axis and should be avoided during refraction. One cannot rely on the compensatory function of ocular counter-torsion during the refraction...|$|R

25|$|Topic marking 2 (tm2) and topic marking 3 (tm3) {{are both}} used with base-generated topics. Tm2 is {{characterized}} by raised eyebrows, widened eyes, and the <b>head</b> <b>tilted</b> backwards and to the side. Toward {{the end of the}} sign the head moves forward and to the opposite side, and there is a pause and often an eye blink before continuing. For tm3 the eyebrows are raised and the eyes are opened wide, the head starts tilted down and jerks up and down, the lips are opened and raised, and the head is nodded rapidly a few times before pausing and continuing the sentence. Although both tm2 and tm3 accompany base-generated topics, they are used in different contexts. Tm2 is used to introduce new information and change the topic of a conversation to something that the signer is going to subsequently characterize, while tm3 is used to introduce new information that the signer believes is already known by his/her interlocutor. Tm2 may be used with any base-generated topic, whereas only topics that are co-referential with an argument in the sentence may be marked with tm3.|$|E

40|$|When <b>tilting</b> the <b>head</b> {{towards the}} {{shoulder}} {{there are numerous}} mechanisms influencing on the generation and maintenance of ocular counter-roll. Each of these mechanisms has its own temporal and spatial characteristics which influences on the counter-rolled eye position. We described a fast transient anti-compensatory torsion movement (torsion peak) as the first response to the <b>head</b> <b>tilting</b> which most certainly has its origin in the vestibular organ and the utricular maculae. Superimposed on this torsion peak we described nystagmus beats with the fast phase directed {{in the same direction}} as the <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> movement suggesting a paralleled activation of the vertical semicircular canals. Synchronous with the torsion peak a fast vertical vergence eye movement was seen. The vertical vergence was always with left eye over right eye in the rightward <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> and always with right eye over left eye the leftward <b>head</b> <b>tilts,</b> thus inducing a physiological skew deviation. The aetiology for this fast vertical vergence response is currently unknown but could probably be explained by a similar vestibular mechanism as for the torsion peak. A substantial amount of ocular counter-rolling (OCR) was a consistent finding in all subjects and test conditions during static <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> The OCR increased with <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> but the relative compensation to the amount of <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> decreased. For example, a 15 ° <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> induced 3 ° OCR which corresponds to a gain of 0. 20. A 30 ° <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> induced an even larger OCR (5 °) which corresponds to a gain of 0. 16. A consistent finding was an OCR disconjugacy of the right and left eye which increased with <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> For instance, a rightward <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> induced a larger ex-cyclo of the left eye than incyclo of the right eye leading to an ex-cyclovergence. The underlying mechanism might be the increased saccular impact in extreme <b>head</b> <b>tilts.</b> Sacculus has been suggested to induce disconjugate OCR while utriculus is thought to induce conjugate OCR. The static <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> induced a vertical disconjugacy (i. e. vertical vergence) that increased with the <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> The direction of the eye position was however not consistent. Some subjects demonstrated a right eye over left eye position in the rightward <b>head</b> <b>tilts</b> while others demonstrated the opposite outcome. This might be explained by a difference in the ocular visual and torsional axes. To maintain binocularity the eyes are forced into vergence and depending on the position of the axes the direction of the vergence movement will differ. When holding the <b>head</b> in a <b>tilted</b> position the torsional position is found to drift. Initially this drift was directed away from the reference position thus increasing the amount of OCR. After a minute the drift was found to change direction and heading towards the reference position, thus decreasing the OCR. The OCR increasing drift might be explained by a decline in the leftward utricular discharge, induced by macula inertia during the initial interaural translation, in favour of the rightward utricular gravitational discharge. The OCR decreasing drift might be explained by an adaptation of the utricular maculae. Other possible explanations might be a leaky neural integrator or a vestibular memory loss which could induce the OCR decreasing drift found during a sustained <b>head</b> <b>tilt...</b>|$|R

Forty-one congenital SOP patients without a trochlear nerve (absent group) and 23 patients with a trochlear nerve (present group) who underwent IO myectomy as the primary surgical treatment were retrospectively reviewed. "Motor success" was defined as postoperative ipsilateral hypertropia ≤ 4 prism diopter (PD). "Head tilt improvement" was regarded as postoperative angle of <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> < 5 degrees (°). Success rates for motor alignment and <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> improvement, cumulative probabilities of success, and factors influencing surgical responses were evaluated. The cumulative probabilities of motor success at 2 years after IO myectomy were 92 % in patients with a trochlear nerve and 86 % in patients without a trochlear nerve (P = 0. 138). The cumulative probabilities of undercorrection and recurrence of hypertropia after 2 years were 0 % in the present group versus 21 % in the absent group (P = 0. 014).

40|$|A newly {{developed}} head-mounted perimeter termed "imo" enables visual field (VF) testing without a fixed head position. Because the positional {{relationship between the}} subject's head and the imo is fixed, the effects of head position changes on the test results are small compared with those obtained using a stationary perimeter. However, only ocular counter-roll (OCR) induced by <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> might affect VF testing. To quantitatively reveal the effects of <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> and OCR on the VF test results, we investigated the associations among the head-tilt angle, OCR amplitude and VF testing results. For 20 healthy subjects, we binocularly recorded static OCR (s-OCR) while <b>tilting</b> the subject's <b>head</b> at an arbitrary angle ranging from 0 ° to 60 ° rightward or leftward in 10 ° increments. By monitoring iris patterns, we evaluated the s-OCR amplitude. We also performed blind spot detection while <b>tilting</b> the subject's <b>head</b> by an arbitrary angle ranging from 0 ° to 50 ° rightward or leftward in 10 ° increments to calculate the angle by which the blind spot rotates because of <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> The association between s-OCR amplitude and head-tilt angle showed a sinusoidal relationship. In blind spot detection, the blind spot rotated to {{the opposite direction of}} the <b>head</b> <b>tilt,</b> and the association between the rotation angle of the blind spot and the head-tilt angle also showed a sinusoidal relationship.

40|$|We {{maintain}} a stable {{perception of the}} visual world despite continuous movements of our eyes, head and body. Perception of upright is a key aspect of such orientation constancy. Here we investigated whether changes in upright perception during sustained <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> were related to simultaneous changes in torsional position of the eyes. We used a subjective visual vertical (SVV) task, modified to track changes in upright perception over time, and a custom video method to measure ocular torsion simultaneously. We tested twelve subjects in upright position, during prolonged (~ 15 min) lateral <b>head</b> <b>tilts</b> of 20 degrees, and also after the head returned to upright position. While the <b>head</b> was <b>tilted,</b> SVV drifted {{in the same direction}} as the <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> (left tilt: - 5. 4 ± 1. 4 o and right tilt: + 2. 2 ± 2. 1 o).

Neither the SVV drift nor the SVV aftereffect were correlated with the changes in ocular torsion. Using the Bayesian spatial-perception model we show that the pattern of SVV drift and aftereffect in our results could be explained by a drift and an adaptation in sensory inputs that encode head orientation. The fact that ocular torsion (mainly driven by the otoliths) could not account for the perceptual changes suggests that neck proprioception could be the primary source of drift in upright perception during <b>head</b> <b>tilt,</b> and subsequently the aftereffect in upright position...|$|R
