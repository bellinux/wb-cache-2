5000|$|Groucho Marx parodies {{this play}} in the 1930 Marx Brothers film, Animal Crackers.

50|$|Some {{time later}} in the bar he used to frequent, Miley walks up to {{a man at the}} bar and offers him a box of matches, the same as he was offered, with the Hellgramite Method ad on it.

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the window. 'I {{must give}} her time!' he thought; then seized by unreasoning terror at this silence, spun round, and caught {{her by the}} arms. Rozsi held back from him, swayed forward and buried her face on his breast....|$|E
