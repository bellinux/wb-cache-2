5|$|Crystalline solids {{cohesion}} {{is obtained}} by a metallic or chemical bond which is formed between the constituent atoms. Chemical bonds can be grouped into two types consisting of ionic and covalent. To form an <b>ionic</b> <b>bond,</b> either a valence or bonding electron separates from one atom and becomes attached to another atom to form oppositely charged ions. The bonding in the static position {{is when the}} ions occupy an equilibrium position where the resulting force between them is zero. When the ions are exerted in tension force, the inter-ionic spacing increases creating an electrostatic attractive force, while a repulsing force under compressive force between the atomic nuclei is dominant.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{similarity}} in how proteins bind the two coenzymes, enzymes almost always show {{a high level}} of specificity for either NAD or NADP. This specificity reflects the distinct metabolic roles of the respective coenzymes, and is the result of distinct sets of amino acid residues in the two types of coenzyme-binding pocket. For instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent enzymes, an <b>ionic</b> <b>bond</b> is formed between a basic amino acid side-chain and the acidic phosphate group of NADP. On the converse, in NAD-dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP from binding. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, and enzymes such as aldose reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can use both coenzymes in some species.|$|E
5|$|Ions in ionic {{compounds}} {{are primarily}} {{held together by}} the electrostatic forces between the charge distribution of these bodies, {{and in particular the}} <b>ionic</b> <b>bond</b> resulting from the long-ranged Coulomb attraction between the net negative charge of the anions and net positive charge of the cations. There is also a small additional attractive force from van der Waals interactions which contributes only around 1–2% of the cohesive energy for small ions. When a pair of ions comes close enough for their outer electron shells (most simple ions have closed shells) to overlap, a short-ranged repulsive force occurs, due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The balance between these forces leads to a potential energy well with a minimum energy when the nuclei are separated by a specific equilibrium distance.|$|E

5|$|Electronegativity is a {{chemical}} property {{that describes the}} tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. If the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent, the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted {{so close to the}} chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an <b>ionic</b> <b>bond).</b> However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them. As mentioned previously, francium is expected to be an exception.|$|E

25|$|An <b>ionic</b> <b>bond</b> {{is formed}} when a metal loses {{one or more}} of its electrons, {{becoming}} a positively charged cation, and the electrons are then gained by the non-metal atom, becoming a negatively charged anion. The two oppositely charged ions attract one another, and the <b>ionic</b> <b>bond</b> is the electrostatic force of attraction between them. For example, sodium (Na), a metal, loses one electron to become an Na+ cation while chlorine (Cl), a non-metal, gains this electron to become Cl−. The ions are held together due to electrostatic attraction, and that compound sodium chloride (NaCl), or common table salt, is formed.|$|E

5000|$|Class A metals are metals {{that form}} hard acids. Hard acids are acids with {{relatively}} <b>ionic</b> <b>bonds.</b> These metals, such as iron, aluminium, titanium, sodium, calcium and the lanthanides, would rather bond with fluorine than iodine. They form stable products with hard bases, which are bases with <b>ionic</b> <b>bonds.</b> They target molecules such as phospholipids, nucleic acids and ATP.|$|R
25|$|For example, when atomic sodium {{reacts with}} atomic chlorine, sodium donates one {{electron}} and attains an oxidation state of +1. Chlorine accepts the electron and its oxidation state {{is reduced to}} −1. The sign of the oxidation state (positive/negative) actually corresponds {{to the value of}} each ion's electronic charge. The attraction of the differently charged sodium and chlorine ions is the reason they then form an <b>ionic</b> <b>bond.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{chemical}} bond {{can be a}} covalent bond, an <b>ionic</b> <b>bond,</b> a hydrogen bond or just because of Van der Waals force. Each {{of these kinds of}} bonds is ascribed to some potential. These potentials create the interactions which hold atoms together in molecules or crystals. In many simple compounds, valence bond theory, the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion model (VSEPR), and the concept of oxidation number can be used to explain molecular structure and composition.|$|E

2500|$|Charges are {{balanced}} by the difference between ADP and ATP.

[...] ATP behaves identically except that it has four hydroxyl groups, giving ATPMg2−. [...] When these differences along with the true charges on the two phosphate groups are considered together, the net charges of −4 on each side are balanced.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrogen {{chloride}} is a diatomic molecule, {{consisting of}} a hydrogen atom H and a chlorine atom Cl connected by a polar covalent bond. The chlorine atom is much more electronegative than the hydrogen atom, which makes this bond polar. Consequently, the molecule has a large dipole moment with a negative partial charge (δ−) at the chlorine atom and a positive partial charge (δ+) at the hydrogen atom. In part because of its high polarity, HCl is very soluble in water (and in other polar solvents). It is polar covalent instead of Ionic because the differences in hydrogen and chlorines electronegativity is small enough that a complete <b>ionic</b> <b>bond</b> doesn't form. Any electronegativity between [...]6 and 1.67 creates a polar covalent bond.|$|E
2500|$|In winemaking, fining is {{the process}} where a {{substance}} (fining agent) {{is added to the}} wine to create an adsorbent, enzymatic or <b>ionic</b> <b>bond</b> with the suspended particles, producing larger molecules and larger particles that will precipitate out of the wine more readily and rapidly. Unlike filtration, which can only remove particulates (such as dead yeast cells and grape fragments), fining can remove soluble substances such as polymerized tannins, coloring phenols and proteins; some of these proteins can cause haziness in wines exposed to high temperatures after bottling. The reduction of tannin can reduce astringency in red wines intended for early drinking. Many substances have historically been used as fining agents, including dried blood powder, but today there are two general types of fining agents [...] organic compounds and solid/mineral materials.|$|E
