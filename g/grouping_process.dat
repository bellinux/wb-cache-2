40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relation between teachers’ cultural backgrounds, their beliefs regarding <b>group</b> <b>processes,</b> their actual support of <b>group</b> <b>processes,</b> and children's behavior in center-based childcare in the Netherlands. For this purpose, 57 teachers of native Dutch and immigrant Moroccan-Dutch, Turkish-Dutch, Surinamese-Dutch, and Antillean-Dutch backgrounds were interviewed about their teaching beliefs and observed while engaging in a constructive play activity with small groups of children. Clear cultural differences in beliefs and corresponding behavior were found. In the interviews, the Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch teachers mentioned concepts relating to <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> more often than the Dutch and Surinamese- and Antillean-Dutch teachers did, and they showed higher support of <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> during play. Moreover, {{the degree to which}} teachers expressed beliefs in <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> was significantly correlated with support of <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> by the teacher and with levels of collaboration and cognitive engagement in children's play. Structural equation modeling was applied to test direct and indirect effects, confirming the hypothesis that comparatively elaborate beliefs of teachers on <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> result in practices supporting <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> as well as more collaboration and cognitive engagement in children's play...|$|R

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} and understand the phenomenon of <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> comparing two Personal Development (PD) group modalities. One group mainly used verbalisation and the other mainly used movement for interaction and self-expression. <b>Group</b> <b>processes</b> were expressed through {{the analysis of the}} participant???s non-verbal movements and the verbal expressions of their experience in the group. The thesis of this study was that <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> can be expressed and identified through movement and verbal expressions. This study built on previous studies that have explored <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> in both Dance Movement Psychotherapy (DMP) and in Verbal Group Psychotherapy fields in relation to PD groups. Two theoretical frameworks that underpinned this study were: DMP as group work and Group Psychotherapy with the primary focus on <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> in PD <b>groups.</b> These theories were selected for their pertinence to the understanding of <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> and PD <b>groups.</b> The comparison between the groups intended to answer the study???s question: which <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> as expressed verbally and non-verbally in movement can be identified in a dance movement PD group compared with a verbal PD group? Qualitative hermeneutic phenomenology methodology was employed in this study in order to answer the above question using two collection and analysis methods: movement observation using Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) and a thematic analysis of participants??? verbal reflections in semi-structured interviews. The findings of the study have shown which <b>group</b> <b>process</b> developed in each of the PD groups identified through the two collections methods. For instance, they were conflict, rivalry, trust, intimacy and cohesion. The analysis of the DM PD group has shown differences in findings between that which the movement observation identified and that which participants described in the interviews. The study aimed to contribute to the body of knowledge regarding <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> in DMP and group psychotherapy theory and research. Exploring <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> through the use of movement and verbalisation adds to the professional development and training in both fields. The study outcome offers an original contribution to practice, through the development of a group work guide for facilitators, derived from the <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> conceptual model.

40|$|Gang {{membership}} {{is a global}} phenomenon and a problem affecting a multitude of official and unofficial agencies, often reported {{by the media and}} causing overwhelming financial strain, as well as increasing fear of crime in communities. Whilst research on gangs has enjoyed popularity for almost a century now, this was mostly based on a criminological perspective, which did not provide a holistic picture for practitioners. Specifically, {{little is known about the}} psychology of gang membership, as such research is still in its infancy. Moreover, calls for understanding the social psychological motives for gang membership - such as gang members' perceptions of <b>group</b> <b>processes,</b> and how these influence individuals - have been present for the last 50 years but development in the area has been limited. The aim of this thesis was to address some of this crucial gap in our knowledge of gang membership, to help enrich theoretical understanding, as well as prevention and rehabilitation strategies, so that these can be appropriately developed. In order for this to happen, it is key to understand which <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> lie behind gang membership based on gang members' subjective experiences, in different types of gang members, and how these relate to members' decisions to join and remain with a gang. The core assumption of gangs - that they are groups - has been largely neglected by research. The studies in this thesis provide the first holistic picture of the relevance of <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> in gang membership. The first, qualitative study, identified that <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> regularly manifesting in groups do, indeed, also manifest in gangs. It was also found that such <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> are understood by gang members in a manner specific to them. Further, the perceived <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> manifested differently at different stages of membership - when joining a gang and when remaining in a gang. The large quantitative studies that follow revealed that gangs differ from non-gang delinquent groups, and that different types of gang members differ in their perception of how <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> manifest. It was found that different types of groups and gangs were characterised by a specific set of perceived <b>group</b> <b>processes.</b> Further, these <b>group</b> <b>process</b> clusters differed, based on the stage of an individual's membership. This thesis therefore uncovered that the area of social cognition based on <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> is important. The main conclusions drawn from the studies presented in this PhD are: 1) <b>Group</b> <b>processes</b> manifest in gangs and are perceived in a specific manner. 2) The perception of <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> differ in gangs and other delinquent groups, and between different types of gang members. 3) There are specific clusters of perceived <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> which characterise specific types of groups and at different stages of membership - <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> should not be dealt with in isolation. 4) The findings show that how gang members perceive <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> should be a key consideration in future research and any intervention strategies designed for gang members...|$|R

The stimuli consisted of thin subthreshold lines, flashed upon gaps between collinear inducers which potentially enable the formation of illusory contours. The subthreshold lines were composed {{of one or more}} segments with opposite contrast polarities. The polarity nearest to the inducerss was varied to differentially excite the short-range filtering process. The experimental results are consistent with neurophysiological evidence for cortical mechanisms of contour processing and with the Boundary Contour System model, which identifies the short-range filtering process with cortical simple cells, and the long-range <b>grouping</b> <b>process</b> with cortical bipole cells. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study investigated the relationship between language background, secondary school score, tutorial <b>group</b> <b>processes,</b> and students’ academic achievement in PBL. A validated tutorial group effectiveness questionnaire was administered to undergraduate medical students in a PBL curriculum at the Nelson R. Mandela School of Medicine (NRMSM) in South Africa. Although 58 percent of the students did not speak English as their first language, the tutorials were in English. Furthermore, secondary school scores differed strongly due to inadequate resources between secondary schools. A path analysis was conducted to test a causal model in which the two independent variables were English as the First Language (EFL) and secondary school scores. These variables were assumed to influence the process variables (cognitive, motivational, and demotivational <b>group</b> <b>processes).</b> Input and process variables were assumed to influence the two output variables, being overall group productivity and students’ academic achievement. All data were analyzed at the individual student level (N = 387). A very good model fit was found (CMIN/DF = 0. 68, GFI = 1. 00, TLI = 1. 02, CFI = 1. 00, RMSEA = 0. 00). EFL and secondary school scores positively affected students’ academic achievement (respectively beta = 0. 24 and beta = 0. 16). EFL negatively affected motivational <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> (beta = - 0. 22). Cognitive <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> positively influenced overall group productivity (beta = 0. 31) and so did motivational <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> (beta = 0. 27).

The present research investigated the roles of <b>group</b> heterogeneity and <b>processes</b> in project-based learning. At the student level, we examined the interaction effect between students' within-group achievement and <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> on their self-and collective efficacy. At the group level, we examined how group heterogeneity {{was associated with the}} average self- and collective efficacy reported by the groups. Sample. The participants were 1, 921 Hong Kong secondary students in 367 project-based learning groups. Method. Student achievement was determined by school examination marks. <b>Group</b> <b>processes,</b> self-efficacy and collective efficacy were measured by a student-report questionnaire. Hierarchical linear modelling was used to analyse the nested data. Results. When individual students in each group were taken as the unit of analysis, results indicated an interaction effect of <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> and students' within-group achievement on the discrepancy between collective- and self-efficacy. When compared with low achievers, high achievers reported lower collective efficacy than self-efficacy when <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> were of low quality. However, both low and high achievers reported higher collective efficacy than self-efficacy when <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> were of high quality. With 367 groups taken as the unit of analysis, the results showed that group heterogeneity, group gender composition and group size were not related to the discrepancy between collective- and self-efficacy reported by the students. Conclusions. Group heterogeneity was not a determinant factor in students' learning efficacy. Instead, the quality of <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> played a pivotal role because both high and low achievers were able to benefit when <b>group</b> <b>processes</b> were of high quality. © 2008 The British Psychological Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an effective method {{to reduce the}} iron losses of wound core distribution transformers based on a combined neural network- genetic algorithm approach. The origi-nality of the work {{presented in this paper}} is that it tackles the iron loss reduction problem during the transformer production phase, while previous works were concentrated on the design phase. More specifically, neural networks effectively use measurements taken at the first stages of core construction in order to predict the iron losses of the assembled transformers, while genetic algorithms are used to improve the <b>grouping</b> <b>process</b> of the individual cores by reducing iron losses of assembled transformers. The proposed method has been tested on a transformer manufacturing industry. The results demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of this approach. Significant reduction of transformer iron losses is ob-served in comparison to the current practice leading to important economic savings for the transformer manufacturer.

40|$|Segmentational {{grouping}} {{in music}} listening {{refers to the}} organisation of individual tones into tone groups that tend to be processed and subsequently recalled as perceptual units or chunks. Grouping of tones via this process tends to occur at natural breaks in structure of a tone sequence, so that relatively larger changes in pitch, amplitude or timing are perceived as boundaries which cue the segmentational <b>grouping</b> <b>process.</b> Segmentational grouping processes have been examined using behavioural research techniques; yet neurophysiological processes underlying the <b>grouping</b> <b>process</b> have received little attention, and are poorly understood. This study aimed to identify brain regions involved in the segmentational <b>grouping</b> <b>process</b> as cued by rhythmic information. Participants performed two auditory tasks while brain electrical activity responses were monitored using Steady-State Probe Topography (SSPT). Behavioural responses evoked in a task probing individuals' use of lengthened-duration tones to organise memory for pitch sequences indicated that longer-duration tones were used as cues to organise working memory representations of the musical patterns. Examination of dynamic SSPT responses during the encoding phase of a probe recognition task indicated that greater use of rhythmic cues to organise working memory representations was associated with activation {{of a network of}} left hemisphere frontal, temporal and parietal regions. During the lengthened tone, activation of left central and vertex regions and progressive activation of left temporal and temporoparietal regions were linked with use of the deviant status of the lengthened tone to update temporal expectations for the sequence. Excitatory responses observed in left posterior frontal and temporal regions to a tone following the lengthened tone were proposed to reflect temporal allocation of attention to this point in time, whereas sustained excitatory activation of left temporal, and temporoparietal regions reflected the role of these regions in supporting representations of the tone events in working memory. Finally, late inhibitory responses to the tone following the lengthened tone in left frontal, temporal, temporoparietal, and parietal regions were linked with the manipulation and closure of the working memory trace in association with the <b>grouping</b> <b>process.</b> Together, these findings support the activation of a network of left frontal, temporal and parietal regions underlying rhythmic grouping of pitch sequences...|$|E
