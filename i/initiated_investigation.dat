Since the generally accepted definition of a CTC includes the expression of epithelial surface markers, such as EpCAM, if a cancer cell loses its epithelial surface markers (which is suggested in EMT), it will not be separated and/or identified as a CTC. We have developed, and previously reported on the use of, a purely negative enrichment technology enriching for CTCs in the blood of squamous cell carcinoma {{of the head and neck}} (SCCHN).

40|$|ObjectivesThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate whether elevated glucose is associated with impaired Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow before primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BackgroundReperfusion before primary PCI in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with an improved outcome. Hyperglycemia in patients with STEMI is associated with an adverse prognosis. Hyperglycemia may induce a pro-thrombotic state and therefore be of influence on TIMI flow before PCI. MethodsA total of 460 consecutive patients with STEMI treated with primary PCI were included in this analysis. Hyperglycemia was defined as a glucose ≥ 7. 8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl). ResultsHyperglycemia was observed in 70 % and TIMI flow grade 3 before primary PCI in 17 % of the patients. Patients with hyperglycemia less often had TIMI flow grade 3 before primary PCI (12 % vs. 28 %, p < 0. 001). After adjustment for differences in baseline variables, hyperglycemia was a strong predictor of absence of reperfusion before primary PCI (odds ratio 2. 6, 95 % confidence interval 1. 5 to 4. 5). ConclusionsHyperglycemia in patients with STEMI is an important predictor of impaired epicardial flow before reperfusion therapy has been <b>initiated.</b> <b>Investigation</b> of methods improving coronary flow before primary PCI in these patients is warranted...|$|E

Cyclic fracturing processes were investigated in such construction elements that are subject to geometric uniformity disturbance, i. e. in heavily loaded defective elements. The limit value of the stress intensity factor was determined using the CT specimens. This value defines the threshold for stress intensity below that a crack does not propagate. The accuracy of these results was tested for a compact specimen with a rounded notch. A cyclic loading program was selected and tests were conducted to determine conditions favouring crack appearance in a defective plate. A cast iron plate with natural defects was loaded cyclically and studied until its breakdown. Experimental investigations prove that conditions for crack formation in defective construction elements are only satisfactorily defined by the fracture mechanics criterion Δ K th (stress intensity factor threshold) and the endurance limit of a plane-surface specimen. The stress and strain state in a defective area having an influence on crack appearance was analysed, and the effect of defects and loading conditions on the processes of crack formation and propagation was evaluated. Programmed computations of geometrical parameters qualify the experimental results...|$|E
