25|$|In 2013, it was {{estimated}} that approximately 71.5 million people worldwide watched eSports. The increasing availability of online streaming media platforms, particularly Twitch.tv, has become central to the growth and promotion of eSports competitions. Demographically, Major League Gaming has reported viewership that is approximately 85% male and 15% female, with a majority of viewers between the ages of 18 and 34. Despite this, several female personalities within eSports are <b>hopeful</b> <b>about</b> the increasing presence of female gamers. South Korea has several established eSports organizations, which have licensed pro gamers since the year 2000. Recognition of eSports competitions outside South Korea has come somewhat slower. Along with South Korea, most competitions take place in Europe, North America and China. Despite its large video game market, eSports in Japan is relatively underdeveloped, which has been attributed largely to its broad anti-gambling laws.|$|E

As a result, the organization profits and grows from the human capital of productive employees and the monetary capital resulting from productive workers.|$|R

500|$|Halfway {{through the}} school year, Ali's family moves to the more {{peaceful}} Kurdish region in Northern Iraq but after living there for several months, Ali {{says that he is}} homesick and misses the action and noise of Baghdad. Mohammad, feeling lonely, [...] "adopts" [...] a bird with a broken wing and a mouse he finds in the house. This brings him some comfort, but his mother later demands that he get rid of the mouse as she does not want [...] "vermin" [...] in the house. Mohammad's family rejoice when Saddam Hussein is sentenced, and feel that his later execution was justified, as to do otherwise would have made the Iraqi people look weak. Conversely, Anmar's family is upset at his execution, as they feel that the people who came into power were no better than Hussein was. Hyder's mother says that many Iraqi people were <b>hopeful</b> <b>about</b> the arrival of American forces, and that it is wrong to blame America for all of the problems in Iraq. She notes that the bloodshed has yet to stop as the Sunni continues to kill the Shiite, and vice versa. As the film continues, Hyder's family loses its income and they start to sell their furniture to earn extra money.|$|E

50|$|Kant {{ends the}} second Critique on a <b>hopeful</b> note <b>about</b> {{the future of}} ethics. The wonders of both the {{physical}} and the ethical worlds are not far for us to find: to feel awe, we should only look upward to the stars or inward to the moral law which we carry around within us. The study {{of the physical world}} was dormant for centuries and wrapped in superstition before the physical sciences actually came into existence. We are allowed to hope that soon the moral sciences will replace superstition with knowledge about ethics.|$|R

50|$|Changeling was {{met with}} mixed {{response}} from the gaming community.While Changeling developed quite a devoted cult following, its themes and subject were often perceived as unnecessarily complex or too childish, and it was generally thought that the game was indecisively written (i.e., Is it a <b>hopeful</b> game <b>about</b> returning magic and imagination to a dull, banal world, {{or is it a}} depressed game of accepting the decay of all that is imaginative and colorful?) and White Wolf discontinued the game {{more than a year before}} the end of the World of Darkness line due to exceedingly low sales.|$|R

The most prominent of these were published by the Jewish Socialist party and the Zionist Labor Movement. These two groups formed alliance but they had no arms.

60|$|The Letters which Mr. Hare has printed, Letters addressed, I imagine, {{mostly to}} himself, {{in this and}} the {{following}} year or two, give record of abundant changeful plannings and laborings, on the part of Sterling; still chiefly in the theological department. Translation from Tholuck, from Schleiermacher; treatise on this thing, then on that, are on the anvil: it is a life of abstruse vague speculations, singularly cheerful and <b>hopeful</b> withal, <b>about</b> Will, Morals, Jonathan Edwards, Jewhood, Manhood, and of Books to be written on these topics. Part of which adventurous vague plans, as the Translation from Tholuck, he actually performed; other greater part, merging always into wider undertakings, remained plan merely. I remember he talked often about Tholuck, Schleiermacher, and others of that stamp; and looked disappointed, though full of good nature, at my obstinate indifference to them and their affairs.|$|R

[...] From a more local perspective, New Orleans architect Steve Bingler, a consultant on the Iberbeille redesign project and a contributor to Brad Pitt’s Make It Right development in the Lower 9th Ward, offered a <b>hopeful</b> commentary <b>about</b> the projects. While he asserted that it would be impossible to conclusively assess the project before its completion, it exhibited careful studies of nuanced archetypes and avoided mere cartoons of them. The architectural styles of the Make It Right houses in no way try to imitate the character of the buildings around them, but Bingler conceded that if one is going to make a copy of something, it is best to do it as authentically as possible.|$|R
5000|$|Lamont sees Coleman's preaching in 1644 as an {{important}} precursor of Thomas Hobbes, anticipating principles {{to be found in}} Leviathan. In 1645 Coleman was strongly opposed by George Gillespie. In A Brotherly Examination Re-examined (1645), Coleman summed up the position: Gillespie had conceded that the opposition to the Erastians, the Presbyterian and Independent groups in the Assembly, had in common their aversion to the Erastian approach. Matters were left to drift while the Presbyterians made <b>hopeful</b> comments <b>about</b> the possible good to come from orderliness within the churches. He could point to John Ley arguing just this way, to attack John Saltmarsh. But they made for strange bedfellows, with the Presbyterians now borrowing the positions of the Independents, considering that the actual contemporary situation was a breakdown of order, and all for the sake of denying the Erastian position of effective control through the state, ...|$|R
