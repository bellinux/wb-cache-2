40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{embryo culture}} medium (CM) and recipient blood plasma using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) metabolomics to identify spectral models predictive of pregnancy outcome. Embryos collected on Day 6 from superovulated cows in 2 countries were individually cultured in synthetic oviduct fluid medium with BSA for 24 [*]h before embryo transfer. Spent CM, blank controls, and plasma samples (Day 0 and Day 7) were evaluated using FTIR. The spectra obtained were analyzed. The discrimination {{capability of the}} classifiers was assessed for accuracy, sensitivity (pregnancy), specificity (nonpregnancy), and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Endpoints considered were Day 60 pregnancy and birth. High AUC was obtained for Day 60 pregnancy in CM within individual laboratories (France AUC= 0. 751 ± 0. 039, Spain AUC= 0. 718 ± 0. 024), while cumulative data decreased the AUC (AUC= 0. 604 [*]±[*] 0. 029). Predictions for CM at birth were lower than Day 60 pregnancy. Predictions with plasma at birth improved cumulative over individual results (Day 0 : France AUC= 0. 690 ± 0. 044; Spain AUC< 0. 55; cumulative AUC= 0. 747 ± 0. 032). Plasma generally predicted pregnancy and birth better than CM. These first results show that FTIR metabolomics could allow the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> and recipients with improved pregnancy viability, which may contribute to increasing the efficiency of selection schemes based on ET...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> {{with high}} {{implantation}} potential remains {{a challenge in}} in vitro fertilization (IVF). Subjective pronuclear (PN) zygote scoring systems {{have been developed for}} that purpose. The aim of this work was to provide a software tool that enables objective measuring of morphological characteristics of the human PN zygote. METHODS A computer program was created to analyse zygote images semi-automatically, providing precise morphological measurements. The accuracy of this approach was first validated by comparing zygotes from two different IVF centres with computer-assisted measurements or subjective scoring. Computer-assisted measurement and subjective scoring were then compared for their ability to classify zygotes with high and low implantation probability by using a linear discriminant analysis. RESULTS Zygote images coming from the two IVF centres were analysed with the software, resulting in a series of precise measurements of 24 variables. Using subjective scoring, the cytoplasmic halo was the only feature which was significantly different between the two IVF centres. Computer-assisted measurements revealed significant differences between centres in PN centring, PN proximity, cytoplasmic halo and features related to nucleolar precursor bodies distribution. The zygote classification error achieved with the computer-assisted measurements (0. 363) was slightly inferior to that of the subjective ones (0. 393). CONCLUSIONS A precise and objective characterization of the morphology of human PN zygotes can be achieved by the use of an advanced image analysis tool. This computer-assisted analysis allows for a better morphological characterization of human zygotes and can be used for classificatio...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years {{the process of}} in vitro {{fertilisation}} (IVF) has evolved considerably, yet the efficiency of this treatment remains relatively poor. The principal challenge faced by doctors and embryologists is the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>embryo</b> with the greatest potential for producing a child. Current methods <b>of</b> <b>embryo</b> viability assessment provide only a rough guide to potential. In order to improve {{the odds of a}} successful pregnancy it is typical to transfer more than one embryo to the uterus. However, this often results in multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc), which are associated with significantly elevated risks of serious complications. If embryo viability could be assessed more accurately, {{it would be possible to}} transfer fewer embryos without negatively impacting IVF pregnancy rates. In order to assist with the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> viable <b>embryos,</b> several scoring systems based on morphological criteria have been developed. However, these mostly rely on a subjective visual analysis. Automated assessment of morphological features offers the possibility of more accurate quantification <b>of</b> key <b>embryo</b> characteristics and elimination of inter- and intra-observer variation. In this paper, we describe the main embryo scoring systems currently in use and review related works on embryo image analysis that could lead to an automatic and precise grading <b>of</b> <b>embryo</b> quality.

40|$|Objective: Accurate and {{efficient}} pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) {{based on the}} analysis of single or oligo-cells is needed for timely <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> that are affected by deleterious genetic traits in in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the backbone of modern genetic diagnoses, and a spectrum of PCR-based techniques {{have been used to}} detect various thalassemia mutations in prenatal diagnosis (PND) and PGD. Among thalassemias, SEA-type α-thalassemia is the most common variety found in Asia, and can lead to Bart's hydrops fetalis and serious maternal complications. Materials and methods: To formulate an efficient digital PCR for clinical diagnosis of SEA-type α-thalassemia in cultured embryos, we conducted a pilot study to detect the α-globin and SEA-type deletion alleles in blastomere biopsies with a highly sensitive microfluidics-based digital PCR method. Genomic DNA from embryo biopsy samples were extracted, and crude DNA extracts were first amplified by a conventional PCR procedure followed by a nested PCR reaction with primers and probes that are designed for digital PCR amplification. Results: Analysis of microfluidics-based PCR reactions showed that robust signals for normal α-globin and SEA-type deletion alleles, together with an internal control gene, can be routinely generated using crude embryo biopsies after a 106 -fold dilution of primary PCR products. Conclusion: The SEA-type deletion in cultured embryos can be sensitively diagnosed with the digital PCR procedure in clinics. The adoption of this robust PGD method could prevent the implantation of IVF embryos that are destined to develop Bart's hydrops fetalis in a timely manner. The results also help inform future development of a standard digital PCR procedure for cost-effective PGD of α-thalassemia in a standard IVF clinic...|$|E

Many sex identification methods using duplex PCR were established according to Sry gene. But the identification process was affected greatly by more primers interaction. In order to decrease the interference from more primers, researchers explored a simple and rapid PCR Method. The sequences of Amelogenin alleles located at both sex chromosomes were downloaded from GenBank. A pair of sex specific primers was designed to span the 63 bp longer insertion sequence in X chromosome. Bovine samples of blood, fibroblasts and demi-embryos were sexed with these primers. Two-temperature PCR cycling program was used in which the extension step was deleted while the denaturizing and annealing steps were shortened to 1 sec. The results shown ideal identification were obtained and observable amplification were also obtained using even single fibroblast. About 20 bovine embryos were identified by this PCR cycling program and 15 embryos (9 females and 6 males) were transferred. The sexing results were confirmed by the anatomically proven sex after parturition, respectively. The comparison of amplification results between blood samples of bovine and human shows the excellent, specificity to bovine. Thus, a simple, rapid and effective PCR sex identification method was established...|$|R
40|$|<b>Identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>embryo</b> implantation-related {{proteins}} Mitra Arianmanesh Embryo implantation is {{a complex}} process involving an active dialogue between the endometrium and embryo. Tightly controlled communication between the hypothalamus, pituitary, corpus luteum (CL), endometrium and embryo is essential for implantation. Unravelling molecules involved in embryo implantation is essential since implantation failure {{is one of the}} main causes of female infertility. Therefore, <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> molecular events during embryo implantation may result in enhancing implantation rates in both natural and assisted reproductive cycles, improving contraceptive design and reducing the rate of multiple pregnancies following embryo transfer in IVF cycles. Thus, in this study, sheep was used as an animal model in order to study endometrial, corpus luteal and plasma proteome changes during embryo implantation and early pregnancy. Endometrium, CLs and plasma were harvested from cyclic ewes on days 12 and 16 of the oestrous cycle (n= 4 ewes/group) and from pregnant ewes on days 12, 16 and 20 of pregnancy (n= 4 ewes/group). Furthermore, ovine endometrium were collected from pregnant and non-pregnant horns on days 16 (n= 4) and 20 (n= 4) of pregnancy to compare endometrial protein profiles of the gravid horn (in the presence of the conceptus) with the non-gravid horn (in the absence of the conceptus) in response to the conceptus to elucidate local embryo-endometrial signalling. 2 DE gel, LC-MS/MS, Western blot, IHC and qRT-PCR were employed to quantify implantation processes. This study has identified proteins in the CL and endometrium with involvement in biological pathways that are fundamental for embryo implantation and gestation. In addition, it was found that the implanting <b>embryo</b> is capable <b>of</b> regulating the expression of endometrial proteins to establish an ideal environment for its implantation and establishment of pregnancy. These findings provide an addition to the field and a solid base for targeted studies to improve our understanding of implantation and its regulation.

40|$|BACKGROUNDThe Fifth Evian Annual Reproduction (EVAR) Workshop Meeting {{discussed}} knowledge regarding contemporary genetics {{in female}} reproduction. METHODSSpecialist reproductive medicine clinicians and geneticists delivered presentations based on published literature and current research. The content {{of this report}} {{is based on the}} expert presentations and subsequent group discussions that took place during this Workshop. RESULTSNumerous ovarian genes with a role in infertility have been identified. Future challenges for genetic screening of patients, such as those with polycystic ovary syndrome, primary ovarian insufficiency or endometriosis, include the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> high-throughput strategies and how to apply these findings to infertile patients. The <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> high-quality <b>embryos</b> in IVF using objective technologies remains a high priority in order to facilitate single-embryo transfer. Gene expression profiling of cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte, and proteomic and metabolomic approaches in embryo culture media may significantly improve non-invasive embryo quality assessment.

40|$|In {{assisted}} reproduction technology, embryo competence is routinely evaluated on morphological criteria. Over the last decade, efforts in improving non-invasive embryo assessment have {{looked into the}} secretome <b>of</b> <b>embryos.</b> Human embryos release genomic DNA (gDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the culture medium, and the mtDNA/gDNA ratio is significantly correlated with embryo fragmentation. Here, we investigate whether mtDNA/gDNA ratio in embryo spent medium is correlated with blastulation potential and implantation. The mtDNA/gDNA ratio was assessed in 699 Day 3 culture media by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to investigate its correlation with embryo morphology, blastocyst development and implantation. A logistic regression model evaluated whether mtDNA/gDNA ratio in the secretome may improve the prediction of blastulation. We found that embryos that successfully developed into blastocysts exhibited a significantly higher mtDNA/gDNA ratio in the culture medium compared with those that arrest (P = 0. 0251), and mtDNA/gDNA, combined with morphological grading, {{has the potential to}} predict blastulation better than morphology alone (P = 0. 02). Moreover, mtDNA/gDNA ratio was higher in the media from good-quality embryos that reached the full blastocyst stage on Day 5 compared with those that developed more slowly (P < 0. 0001). With respect to blastocyst morphology, higher trophectoderm quality was associated with a higher mtDNA/gDNA ratio in the culture medium. Finally, a high mtDNA/gDNA ratio in spent medium was associated with successful implantation outcome (P = 0. 0452) <b>of</b> good-quality <b>embryos.</b> In summary, the mtDNA/gDNA ratio in the Day 3 embryo secretome, in combination with morphological grading, may be a novel, non-invasive, early biomarker to improve <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> viable <b>embryos</b> with high developmental potential...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors influencing embryo viability is chromosome imbalance (aneuploidy). Embryos derived from aneuploid gametes have little potential for forming a viable pregnancy, but cannot be distinguished from normal embryos using standard morphological evaluation. For more than a decade, preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) has been used to assist in the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> aneuploid <b>embryos.</b> However, current strategies, based upon cell biopsy followed by fluorescent in situ hybridization, allow {{less than half of the}} chromosomes to be screened. In this review, we discuss methods that overcome the limitations of earlier PGS strategies and provide screening of the entire chromosome complement in oocytes and embryos. In recent months, there has been a rapid growth in the number of PGS cycles utilizing one such method, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Data from IVF cycles utilizing CGH must be considered preliminary, but appear to indicate a dramatic increase in embryo implantation following comprehensive chromosomal screening. It is expected that methods based upon micro-arrays will yield similar clinical results and may be sufficiently rapid to permit comprehensive screening without the need for embryo cryopreservation. Some microarray platforms also offer the advantage <b>of</b> <b>embryo</b> fingerprinting and the potential for combined aneuploidy and single gene disorder diagnosis. However, more data concerning accuracy and further reductions in the price of tests will be necessary before microarrays can be widely applied.

In vitro analysis of NCC emigration from D 9 neural tube explants revealed a delay in the release of NCCs from mutant neural tubes compared to controls, suggesting that the primary effect of the mutation was intrinsic to the neuroepithelium. Immunofluorescent localization of the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) antibody in situ demonstrated an increased intensity of antibody fluorescence in mutant tissue compared to controls, and further characterization by immunoblot analysis showed an altered embryonic N-CAM profile in both Sp and $Sp sp{d}$ mutants at D 9 of gestation.

40|$|Context: Metabolomics was {{introduced}} in human in vitro fertilization (IVF) for noninvasive <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> viable <b>embryos</b> with the highest developmental competence. Aims: To determine whether embryo selection using a commercial version of metabolomic analysis leads to increased implantation rates (IRs) with fetal cardiac activity (FCA) compared with morphology evaluation alone. Setting and Design: Randomized controlled trial from April to December 2010 at a private IVF unit. The study was terminated prematurely due to the market withdrawal of the instrument. Materials and Methods: IVF patients ≥ 18 and ≤ 43 years with ≥ 4 × 2 PN were randomly allocated to metabolomic analysis combined with embryo morphology (ViaMetrics-E; metabolomics + morphology group) or embryo morphology alone (morphology group). Cycles with frozen embryos, oocyte donations, or testicular biopsy were excluded. Statistical Analysis: Categorical and continuous data were analyzed for statistical significance using 2 -tailed Fisher′s exact test and t-test, respectively. Statistical significance was accepted when P < 0. 05. Results: A total of 125 patients {{were included in the}} study; 39 patients were allocated to metabolomics + morphology group and 86 patients to morphology group. Patients were stratified according to the day <b>of</b> <b>embryo</b> transfer (Days 2, 3, or 5). IRs with FCA were similar for Days 2 and 3 transfers in both groups. For Day 5 transfers, IRs with FCA were significantly higher in the metabolomics + morphology group (46. 8 % vs. 28. 9 %; P = 0. 041; 95 % confidence intervalp [CI]: 1. 09 - 34. 18). Pregnancy and live births rates were similar for Days 2, 3, and 5 in both groups. The study was terminated early following the voluntary market withdrawal of ViaMetrics-E in December 2010. Conclusions: Metabolomic analysis using the commercial near-infrared (NIR) instrument {{does not appear to have}} a beneficial effect on pregnancy and live births, with improvement in IR with FCA for Day 5 transfers.

40|$|Alternative {{splicing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important mechanisms to generate a large number of mRNA and protein isoforms from a small number of genes. Its study became one of the hot topics in computational genome analysis. The repository EASED (Extended Alternatively Spliced EST Database, [URL] stores a large collection of splice variants predicted from comparing the human genome against EST databases. It enables finding new unpublished splice forms that could be interesting candidate genes for stage specific, diseases specific or tissue specific splicing. The main idea behind selecting specific splice forms is to compare the number and the origin of ESTs confirming one isoform with the number and the origin of ESTs confirming the opposite isoform. A measure asDcs is introduced to take into account the unequal distribution of ESTs per splice site on one hand, and the possible uncertainties due to the relatively low quality of EST data on the other hand. First, the number of ESTs per splice site is scaled with a modified Hill function. The measure asDcs computes in the second step the distance of each pair of ESTs from equipartition. Equipartition exists if for every number of adult ESTs the same number of embryonic ESTs. The effect of several input parameters for the scaling of true EST values is analysed and can be reproduced on [URL] Some of the obtained best scoring hits for selected parameters (transcription factor P 65, drebrin, and fetuin) have been already described in literature as been involved in embryonic development.

40|$|The use of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) as a {{reporter}} for expression transgenes opens the way to several new experimental strategies for the study of gene regulation in sea urchin development. A GFP coding sequence was associated with three different previously studied cis-regulatory systems, viz those of the SM 50 gene, expressed in skeletogenic mesenchyme, the CyIIa gene, expressed in archenteron, skeletogenic and secondary mesenchyme, and the Endo 16 gene, expressed in vegetal plate, archenteron and midgut. We demonstrate that the sensitivity with which expression can be detected is equal to or greater than that of whole-mount in situ hybridization applied to detection of CAT mRNA synthesized {{under the control of the}} same cis-regulatory systems. However, in addition to the important feature that it can be visualized nondestructively in living embryos, GFP has other advantages. First, it freely diffuses even within fine cytoplasmic cables, and thus reveals connections between cells, which in sea urchin embryos is particularly useful for observations on regulatory systems that operate in the syncytial skeletogenic mesenchyme. Second, GFP expression can be dramatically visualized in postembryonic larval tissues.

Third, GFP permits <b>identification</b> and segregation <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> in which the clonal incorporation of injected DNA has occurred in any particular desired region <b>of</b> the <b>embryo.</b> Thus, we show explicitly that, as expected, GFP transgenes are incorporated in the same nuclei together with other transgenes with which they are co-injected...|$|R

These results have been contested by the work of Kroll and Amaya [2], which shows that Xenopus embryos transgenic for a dominant-negative form of the FGF receptor (FGF-RI) express posterior Hox genes normally, leading these authors to suggest that the FGFs are not required for anteroposterior (A–P) patterning of the dorsal axis. In order to investigate the apparent discrepancy between these studies, we have produced Xenopus embryos transgenic for two inhibitors of the FGF/Caudal pathway: a kinase-deficient dominant-negative FGF receptor (XFD) [3]; and a domain-swapped form of Xcad 3 (Xcad–EnR) in which the activation domain of Xcad 3 is replaced by the repression domain of the Drosophila Engrailed protein.

All six species had relatively large spatulate embryos. Imbibition studies showed all species possessed PY (i. e. a water-impervious seed coat) that was broken by a hot-water treatment. Alleviation of PY resulted in high germination...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{amplification}} potential {{and establish a}} two-temperature PCR sex identification method, DNA templates prepared from bovine blood, sperm and hair follicles were amplified through two-temperature PCR in this study. Fragments from 207 - 1413 bp could be amplified successfully while fragments of 1500 bp in length could not be amplified. In further studies we found that an extension step was necessary to amplify longer fragments and as the extension time decreased, the denaturation and annealing times were increased. After optimization we found the best two-temperature PCR to be a reaction using 1. 0 mmol L - 1 Mg 2 +, 1. 0 unit polymerase and 30 cycles. The amplification results using different equipment and Taq polymerases indicated that the two-temperature PCR {{can be used for}} any fragment equal to or < 1413 bp with any common Taq polymerase. The kinetic rate of the polymerase was determined to be the factor limiting the amplification length and rate. Additionally, the PCR timing was shortened from 1. 5 - 2. 0 h to 30 - 38 min with the two-temperature PCR. The sex <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> bovine blood, fibroblasts and blastmeres were carried out by turns using this rapid PCR and a rapid sex <b>identification</b> method <b>of</b> cattle <b>embryo</b> was establishment. Both amplification time and cost were saved greatly with this method and we found that the two-temperature PCR was sensitive and fast enough for widespread use in many research areas such as genetics, sex identification, forensics and clinical medicine...|$|R
40|$|I n {{the past}} 20 years, {{molecular}} genetics has successfullyentered the arrhythmia field. 1, 2 The <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the genetic basis {{of many of}} the arrhythmia syndromes provided us the tools for better understanding of the pathophysiolog-ical basis of these syndromes, 2 for presymptomatic testing (potentially also prenatally with the possibility of extrauterine fertilization and selection <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> without the identified mutation) and for timely treatment of family members of a more clearly affected proband, 3, 4 for gene-specific therapy 2 and, occasionally, also for new, mechanism-driven therapy. 2 For example, gene-specific treatment has become very common in the long QT syndrome. 2 Examples of truly new therapeutic modalities, envisioned only after unraveling the molecular genetic basis and the associated pathophysiolog-ical mechanism, however, are relatively scarce.

40|$|Abstract Background Zebrafish (D. rerio) {{has become}} a {{powerful}} and widely used model system {{for the analysis of}} vertebrate embryogenesis and organ development. While genetic methods are readily available in zebrafish, protocols for two dimensional (2 D) gel electrophoresis and proteomics have yet to be developed. Results As a prerequisite to carry out proteomic experiments with early zebrafish embryos, we developed a method to efficiently remove the yolk from large batches <b>of</b> <b>embryos.</b> This method enabled high resolution 2 D gel electrophoresis and improved Western blotting considerably. Here, we provide detailed protocols for proteomics in zebrafish from sample preparation to mass spectrometry (MS), including a comparison of databases for MS <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> zebrafish proteins. Conclusion The provided protocols for proteomic analysis <b>of</b> early <b>embryos</b> enable research to be taken in novel directions in embryogenesis. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Identification</b> <b>of</b> the {{suitable}} genotype for {{somatic embryogenesis}} in soybean culture {{is very important}} for further application in Genetic Improvement Programs. The objective of the investigation was to determine the effect of the orientation and length of immature cotyledons in the formation <b>of</b> somatic <b>embryos</b> <b>of</b> two Cuban soybean genotypes (Incasoy- 24 and Incasoy- 35). The genotype Williams- 82 was included as control. Two orientations were evaluated: abaxial and adaxial, as well as five lengths of the immature cotyledons: 2. 0, 3. 0, 4. 0, 5. 0 and 6. 0 mm. Results demonstrated that the orientation and seed size are determinant in the number <b>of</b> somatic <b>embryos</b> formed in the Cuban genotypes evaluated. The highest values <b>of</b> somatic <b>embryos</b> per cotyledon were obtained in abaxial orientation. The highest embryogenic response was achieved using cotyledons of 4. 0 mm length. These results provided basic information for further researches in this crop. Keywords: abaxial orientation, regeneration, somatic embryogenesi...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} staging <b>embryos</b> <b>of</b> plants. In particular, this invention relates to a method for creating a relational database by determining transcript levels of sets of genes expressed at predetermined stages in embryo development. This approach creates a method by which <b>embryos</b> <b>of</b> unknown stage development can be determined by comparisons between expression levels <b>of</b> those <b>embryos</b> to the expression levels found in the database. This approach further allows rapid <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> transcripts in an embryo to be staged by the utilization of probes corresponding to cDNAs comprising the database. Additionally, this invention relates to a method for selecting advantageous plant clones for future propagation. Specifically, this method relates to an approach to link the biochemical condition <b>of</b> an <b>embryo</b> to current culture conditions and thus provides a method for enhancing conditions to produce embryos with a desired biochemical state.

40|$|Objective: To {{report a}} {{successful}} case of {{preimplantation genetic diagnosis}} (PGD) for Huntington disease using whole genome amplification. Design: Case report. Setting: University assisted reproduction unit. Patient(s) : A couple with family history of Huntington disease: The husband was carrying the expanded allele of the IT 15 gene, and the wife had the normal allele. Intervention(s) : Preimplantation genetic diagnosis with whole genome amplification for <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> genetically normal <b>embryos.</b> Main Outcome Measure(s) : Live birth. Result(s) : In an IVF cycle, 15 oocytes were retrieved, of which 13 were mature and 11 were fertilized. On day 3, embryo biopsy and PGD were performed on ten good-quality embryos. Multiple displacement amplification was conducted, followed by polymerase chain reaction with fluorescence primers. Three pairs of primers {{were used for the}} amplification of the IT 15 gene at the: 1) trinucleotide expansion site; 2) trinucleotide expansion site plus the polymorphic site situated on its 3 ′-end; and 3) polymorphic marker located downstream of the trinucleotide repeats. Two normal blastocysts were replaced on day 5 and another two good-quality blastocysts were cryopreserved. The woman gave birth to a normal baby girl whose normal genetic status was confirmed by prenatal diagnosis. Conclusion(s) : Whole genome amplification by multiple displacement amplification can be used for PGD of Huntington disease. © 2009 American Society for Reproductive Medicine. postprin...|$|R
