Calf performance in H and A dams was treated as a different trait. Models compared included fixed birth year, cow age, and sex classes and crossbreeding effect as a covariate; random direct and maternal genetic and permanent environmental effects were also included, but their variance structure was different. Model I assumed homogeneous variances across breed groups. Model II accounted for <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>variances.</b> Sires were ranked based on PBV from each model, and means of PBV of selected sires were calculated based on Model II. Differences between mean PBV were small for BWT, intermediate for WW, and larger for YW. Differences in PBV of selected sires increased as selection intensity increased, but only for WW and YW. Large differences in mean PBV of selected sires between maternal environments (H vs A) were observed for WW and YW for various sire breeds. Means of PBV of selected sires based on Model II exceeded those based on Model I by 6 to 16 kg of YW for various selection intensities and maternal environments. Estimates of breed of sire effects from Model I or II were similar for BWT and WW, but large differences were found for YW.

40|$|ABSTRACT- Genetic {{evaluations}} {{should become}} more accurate {{with the advent}} of whole genome selection (WGS) based on high density SNP panels. The use of WGS should then accelerate genetic gains for production traits given likely decreases in generation interval due to the greater intent to select more animals based just on their genotypes rather than phenotypes. However, past and current genetic evaluations may not generally connect well to the intended scope of inference. For example, estimating haplotype effects from the data of a single reference population does not bode well for the use of WGS in other diverse environments since the scope of inference is too narrow; conversely, WGS based on estimates, for example, derived from daughter yield deviations of dairy bulls may be too broad to infer upon genetic merit under any one particular environment. The treatment of contemporary group effects as random rather than as fixed, <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>variances,</b> genotype by environment interaction, and multiple trait analyses are all important scope of inference issues that are discussed in this review.
