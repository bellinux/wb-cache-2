Designed by the German architect Franz Heinrich Schwechten, it fell into disrepair after the disruptions of World War I and World War II. The palace was restored in 1957 according to plans by the architect Alfredas Brusokas. It opened as an amber museum in 1963 as a branch of the Lithuanian Museum of Fine Arts, with a small collection of about 480 pieces; it received its millionth visitor on August 13, 1970. The palace was incorporated into the Lithuanian Art Museum during the 1990s, and continues to expand.|$|E

Following his conversion, he traveled through the Southeastern United States, teaching a form of Pentecostalism that emphasized strict personal holiness and frequent contact with venomous snakes.

Hensley was married four times and fathered thirteen children. He had many conflicts with his family members because of his drunkenness, frequent travels, and inability to earn steady income, factors cited by his first three wives as reasons for their divorces.|$|E

The empirical analysis {{shows that the}} higher the fertility willingness of the “universal two-child policy”, the better the financial operation of pension fund. The following policies could be introduced: (1) maternity allowance for the <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> the second child, (2) income tax relief for the <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> the second child, (3) in implementing policies such as “low rent housing”, “affordable housing” give priority to the <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> the second child, (4) providing additional medical insurance benefits for the <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> the second child, (5) education fee, especially the cost at the university, is waivered for these families, (6) some preferential tax policies in domestic service industry are introduced, which reduces some pressure of rearing child.|$|R
40|$|According to {{incomplete}} statistics, {{the number}} of <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> lost their only child had reached {{more than one million}} in China currently, following an annual increase by 76, 000. The problem of elder care of these <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> lost their only child has become a hot issue in China. Legislation and relevant policies about <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> lost their only child are not suffi-cient, which have caused the lack of basis on establishing a reasonable elder care system of those families. This paper is aiming to address the rights as a core and further supplement {{on the basis of the}} present situation of <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> lost their only child, therefore implement to build the pension right system of loss of only child families. Meanwhile, we also strive to put forward spe-cific advices on establishing legislation and relevant policies...|$|R

5|$|When Scotland finally {{paid the}} ransom in 1424, James, aged 32, {{returned}} with his English bride determined to assert this authority. Several {{members of the}} Albany family were executed, and he succeeded in centralising control {{in the hands of}} the crown, but at the cost of increasingly unpopularity and he was assassinated in 1437. His son James II when he came of age in 1449, continued his father's policy of weakening the great noble families, most notably taking on the powerful Black Douglas <b>family</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> come to prominence at the time of Robert I. His attempt to take Roxburgh from the English in 1460 succeeded, but at the cost of his life as he was killed by an exploding artillery piece.|$|E
5|$|In 743, {{after the}} death of Caliph Hisham, Walid II {{reconfirmed}} Nasr in his post, but the influential governor of Iraq, Yusuf ibn Umar al-Thaqafi, an opponent of Nasr, tried to lure him away from his province by calling him to Iraq. Nasr delayed his departure, stalling for time, and was saved by the murder of Walid in April 744. However, Walid's successor, Yazid III, moved to install a regime dominated by the Yemeni Kalbi tribe. Nasr's position was severely undermined, and the Yemeni faction now hoped to see their leader Juday' al-Kirmani appointed governor in his stead. Indeed, Yazid appointed his favourite, the Kalbi Mansur ibn Jumhur, as governor of Iraq, and he in turn nominated his own brother as Nasr's replacement. Nasr refused to accept this, and was again fortunate in his persistence, for Mansur fell out of favour and was dismissed after only two months. Agitation among the Yemeni faction persisted, amidst rumours that Nasr had intercepted letters appointing al-Kirmani as governor, and a dispute on the payment of stipends to the muqatila. Nasr tried to secure his own position by deposing al-Kirmani from his leadership of the Azd, as well as by trying to win over Azd and Rabi'ah leaders. This led to a general uprising by the Azd and Rabi'ah under al-Kirmani. It is indicative of the lingering intertribal antagonism of the late Umayyad world that the rebellion was launched in the name of revenge for the Muhallabids, an Azd <b>family</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been purged after rebelling in 720, an act which had since become a symbol of Yemeni resentment of the Umayyads and their northern Arab-dominated regime.|$|E
