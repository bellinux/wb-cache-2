40|$|Problem statement: Data {{entry form}} is a {{convenient}} and successful tool for information collection by {{filling in the}} sheets using pen and handwriting. One {{of the most important}} fields in these forms is the <b>data</b> <b>filled</b> boxes. Extracting the handwriting from the data entry forms is important for many purposes such as in documenting and archiving. The extraction process is also important in situations such as when it is necessary to the handwritten recognition process. Approach: A simple and effective approach is presented to extract handwritten characters, including digits and letters of any language from <b>data</b> <b>filled</b> boxes of <b>data</b> entry form and to deal with cases of overlaps between the handwritten characters and boxes lines. The proposed approach is based on line shape characteristic by detecting and removing the vertical and horizontal straight boxes lines, while preserving the curved lines which represent the handwritten characters. The problem of the handwritten characters overlapping with the <b>data</b> <b>filled</b> boxes line is solved using morphology dilation to reconstruct the broken characters after the removal of the boxes lines. Results: Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed approach can extract handwriting from <b>data</b> <b>filled</b> boxes with overall 94. 052 % for data collection of 150 forms. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm has been successfully implemented and tested to achieve the objectives of handwritten extraction of any language from <b>data</b> <b>filled</b> boxes.

30|$|Soft {{set theory}} is a {{mathematical}} approach that provides solution {{for dealing with}} uncertain data. As a standard soft set, it can be represented as a Boolean-valued information system, and hence {{it has been used}} in hundreds of useful applications. Meanwhile, these applications become worthless if the Boolean information system contains missing data due to error, security or mishandling. Few researches exist that focused on handling partially incomplete soft set and none of them has high accuracy rate in prediction performance of handling missing data. It is shown that the <b>data</b> <b>filling</b> approach for incomplete soft set (DFIS) has the best performance among all previous approaches. However, in reviewing DFIS, accuracy is still its main problem. In this paper, we propose an alternative <b>data</b> <b>filling</b> approach for prediction of missing data in soft sets, namely ADFIS. The novelty of ADFIS is that, unlike the previous approach that used probability, we focus more on reliability of association among parameters in soft set.
