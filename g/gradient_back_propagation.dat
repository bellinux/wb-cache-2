However, this algorithm is well-known to have difficulties with local minima problem particularly caused by neuron saturation in the hidden layer. Most existing approaches modify the learning model in order to add a random factor to the model, which overcomes the tendency to sink into local minima. However, the random perturbations of the search direction and various kinds of stochastic adjustment to the current set of weights are not effective in enabling a network to escape from local minima which cause the network fail to converge to a global minimum within a reasonable number of iterations.

In the past, several studies have been carried-out to identify NIHL industrial workers. Unfortunately, these studies neglected some important factors that directly affect hearing ability in human. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) provides very effective way to predict hearing loss in humans.

40|$|An ongoing {{challenge}} in neuromorphic computing is to devise general and computationally efficient models of inference and learning which {{are compatible with}} the spatial and temporal constraints of the brain. One increasingly popular and successful approach is to take inspiration from inference and learning algorithms used in deep neural networks. However, the workhorse of deep learning, the <b>gradient</b> descent <b>Back</b> <b>Propagation</b> (BP) rule, often relies on the immediate availability of network-wide information stored with high-precision memory, and precise operations {{that are difficult to}} realize in neuromorphic hardware. Remarkably, recent work showed that exact backpropagated weights are not essential for learning deep representations. Random BP replaces feedback weights with random ones and encourages the network to adjust its feed-forward weights to learn pseudo-inverses of the (random) feedback weights. Building on these results, we demonstrate an event-driven random BP (eRBP) rule that uses an error-modulated synaptic plasticity for learning deep representations in neuromorphic computing hardware. The rule requires only one addition and two comparisons for each synaptic weight using a two-compartment leaky Integrate & Fire (I&F) neuron, making it very suitable for implementation in digital or mixed-signal neuromorphic hardware.

Hence, a prediction model that airliners can use to forecast possible delays is of significant importance. In this regards, artificial neural network (ANN) techniques can be beneficial for this application. One of the main challenges of using ANNs is handling nominal variables. 1 -of-N encoding is widely used to deal with this problem, however, this method is known to reduce the performance of ANN's by introducing multicollinearity. In this paper, we introduce a new type of multilevel input layer ANN that can handle nominal variables and is interpretable in a sense that one can easily see the relationships between different input variables and output variables. As a case study, the proposed method was applied to predict the delay of incoming flights at JFK airport, where the neurons of each sublayer of the input layer symbolize the delay sources at different levels of the system, and the activation of each neuron represents the possibility of being the source of overall delay.

40|$|Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) techniques, mostly Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) {{algorithm}} {{has been}} used as a tool for recognizing a mapping function among a known set of input and output examples. These networks can be trained with <b>gradient</b> descent <b>back</b> <b>propagation.</b> The algorithm is not definite in finding the global minimum of the error function since gradient descent may get stuck in local minima, where it may stay indefinitely. Among the conventional methods, some researchers prefer Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) because of its convergence speed and performance. On the other hand, LM algorithms which are derivative based algorithms still face a risk of getting stuck in local minima. Recently, a novel meta-heuristic search technique called cuckoo search (CS) has gained a great deal of attention from researchers due to its efficient convergence towards optimal solution. But Cuckoo search is prone to less optimal solution during exploration and exploitation process due to large step lengths taken by CS due to Levy flight. It can also be used to improve the balance between exploration and exploitation of CS algorithm, and to increase the chances of the egg’s survival. This research proposed an improved CS called hybrid Accelerated Cuckoo Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (HACPSO) with Accelerated particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) algorithm. In the proposed HACPSO algorithm, initially accelerated particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm searches within the search space and finds the best sub-search space, and then the CS selects the best nest by traversing the sub-search space. This exploration and exploitation method followed in the proposed HACPSO algorithm makes it to converge to global optima with more efficiency than the original Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm. Finally, the proposed CS hybrid variants such as; HACPSO, HACPSO-BP, HACPSO-LM, CSBP, CSLM, CSERN, and CSLMERN are evaluated and compared with conventional <b>Back</b> <b>propagation</b> Neural Network (BPNN), Artificial Bee Colony Neural Network (ABCNN), Artificial Bee Colony <b>Back</b> <b>propagation</b> algorithm (ABC-BP), and Artificial Bee Colony Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (ABC-LM). Specifically, 6 benchmark classification datasets are used for training the hybrid Artificial Neural Network algorithms. Overall from the simulation results, it is realized that the proposed CS based NN algorithms performs better than all other proposed and conventional models in terms of CPU Time, MSE, SD and accuracy...|$|R
40|$|As {{traditional}} {{neural network}} consumes {{a significant amount}} of computing resources during <b>back</b> <b>propagation,</b> Sun 2017 mePropSB propose a simple yet effective technique to alleviate this problem. In this technique, only a small subset of the full gradients are computed to update the model parameters. In this paper we extend this technique into the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to reduce calculation in <b>back</b> <b>propagation,</b> and the surprising results verify its validity in CNN: only 5 % of the <b>gradients</b> are passed <b>back</b> but the model still achieves the same effect as the traditional CNN, or even better. We also show that the top-k selection of gradients leads to a sparse calculation in <b>back</b> <b>propagation,</b> which may bring significant computational benefits for high computational complexity of convolution operation in CNN...|$|R
40|$|Pectus excavatum is {{the most}} common {{deformity}} of the thorax and usually comprises Computed Tomography (CT) examination for pre-operative diagnosis. Aiming at the elimination of the high amounts of CT radiation exposure, this work presents a new methodology for the replacement of CT by a laser scanner (radiation-free) in the treatment of pectus excavatum using personally modeled prosthesis. The complete elimination of CT involves the determination of ribs external outline, at the maximum sternum depression point for prosthesis placement, based on chest wall skin surface information, acquired by a laser scanner. The developed solution resorts to artificial neural networks trained with data vectors from 165 patients. Scaled Conjugate <b>Gradient,</b> Levenberg-Marquardt, Resilient <b>Back</b> <b>propagation</b> and One Step Secant gradient learning algorithms were used. The training procedure was performed using the soft tissue thicknesses, determined using image processing techniques that automatically segment the skin and rib cage. The developed solution was then used to determine the ribs outline in data from 20 patient scanners. Tests revealed that ribs position can be estimated with an average error of about 6. 82 ± 5. 7 mm for the left and right side of the patient. Such an error range is well below current prosthesis manual modeling (11. 7 ± 4. 01 mm) even without CT imagiology, indicating a considerable step forward towards CT replacement by a 3 D scanner for prosthesis personalization...|$|R
30|$|<b>Back</b> <b>propagation</b> works {{similarly}} to <b>back</b> <b>propagation</b> in feed forward neural networks but is {{commonly referred to}} as <b>back</b> <b>propagation</b> through time since gradients are computed with respect to weights at previous time steps in addition to the current time step. It is also common to limit the length of the sequence through which to back propagate for the sake of memory efficiency and in this case it is referred to as truncated <b>back</b> <b>propagation</b> through time.|$|R
