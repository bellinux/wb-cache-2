60|$|Instead {{of going}} to Whamond's house in the school wynd I hastened down the Banker's close to the kirk, and had almost to turn back, so choked was the close with <b>floating</b> <b>refuse.</b> I could see the bell swaying, but the kirk was locked, and I {{battered}} {{on the door to}} no purpose. Then, remembering that Henry Munn lived in Coutt's trance, I set off for his house. He saw me crossing the square, but would not open his door until I was close to it.|$|E
60|$|She {{came upon}} the river just as the bridge was being opened. Down toward the lake, which had to her all the wonder and expanse of the sea, boats lay thickly, steamers from deep water, long, narrow and black. Excursion boats, gleaming white, and trimmed with shining brass, lay beside the wharves, and low-lying tugs, sturdy, rowdyish little things, passed by, {{floating}} like ducks and pulling like bull-dogs, guiding great two-masted sailing boats and long, low, grimy steamers, with high decks at the ends. The river ran below, gray-green, covered with <b>floating</b> <b>refuse.</b> Mountainous buildings stood {{on either side of}} the waterway.|$|E
5000|$|The Hong Kong nets are {{generally}} 35 mm square {{on the surface}} 2 m and 100 mm square thereafter. They are suspended off 225 mm HDPE pipe or BL14 Marine Float Lines, and anchored strongly to resist the many typhoons and waves up to 10 m. They are anti-fouled, and {{spend an average of}} 9 months a year in the water. An average net enclosure would be 500 m long and either semi-circular or rectangular in shape. They are diver-inspected a minimum of two times a week, and independent verification is required. They also exclude <b>floating</b> <b>refuse,</b> and clearly define the swimming area. They can be clearly picked out on Google Earth - at 22^14'38" [...] North, 114^11'26" [...] East, see [...] "Repulse Bay".|$|E
50|$|The search party {{organized}} by Alvarenga's boss {{failed to find}} any trace of the missing men and gave up after two days due to poor visibility. As days became weeks, Alvarenga and CÃ³rdoba learned to scavenge their food from whatever sources presented themselves. Alvarenga managed to catch fish, turtles, jellyfish, and seabirds with his bare hands, and the pair occasionally salvaged bits of food and plastic <b>refuse</b> <b>floating</b> in the water. They collected drinking water from rainfall when possible, but more frequently were forced to drink turtle blood or their own urine.|$|R
50|$|A {{fourth century}} legend, often told {{to explain the}} birth of Chilika, states that the pirate king, Raktabahhu, planned to attack Puri with a huge fleet of ships. To avoid detection, he stealthily {{anchored}} out of sight, off the mouth to the sea. The deception was revealed by ships' <b>refuse</b> <b>floating</b> to the shore, thus warning the town's people, who escaped with all their possessions. Raktabahu felt betrayed when he found an abandoned town and directed his fury towards the seathat had betrayed him. The sea parted to let the army march in, then surged back, drowned the army and formed the present lake.|$|R
