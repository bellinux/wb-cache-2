Members of the SA got wind of the proposed action and thousands of them took to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. RÃ¶hm was shot <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> cell when he refused to commit suicide; GÃ¶ring personally went over the lists of detaineesânumbering in the thousandsâand determined who else should be shot.

Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been under way to overthrow the Reich.
