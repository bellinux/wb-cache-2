50|$|The West Highland Railway {{crossed over}} the C&OR line at Crianlarich and it was {{proposed}} that a connecting line be built; {{this was to be}} {{at the expense of the}} West Highland company, and it would be for the exchange of wagons, not as a through line. Much of the cattle and sheep traffic carried by the West Highland was destined for Stirling and Perth, and would be routed via Callander. The short line was quickly built, but actual commissioning was long delayed.

50|$|Hiking Telescope Peak by {{the normal}} route {{involves}} a 14 mi round trip hike. The trail {{starts in the}} western part of Death Valley National Park at Mahogany Flat campground. The trail slowly winds itself up to the summit 7 mi later at a steady gradient of roughly 8%. The standard route is maintained by the National Park Service, and no permit is required to climb the mountain. This route leaves directly from the Mahogany Flat Campground, and travels approximately two miles to Arcane Meadows. From Arcane Meadows, the trail winds five more miles gradually up toward Telescope Peak, mostly following the ridgeline to the summit. This route can also be used to access two nearby peaks, Bennett Peak and Rogers Peak, a traverse that adds on minimal <b>extra</b> <b>mileage.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the years}} leading to 1876 {{passengers}} from Stranraer to London by the evening boat train went via Annan on the G&SWR to Carlisle, joining an LNWR train there. The {{arrival of the}} Midland Railway at Carlisle on completion of the Settle and Carlisle Line, and the alliance between the MR and the G&SWR, meant that boat train passengers could join a London through train at Dumfries. Accordingly the Caledonian arranged for the boat train to continue from Dumfries (where it had formerly terminated) to Lockerbie; there a through sleeping car {{was attached to the}} Up Perth mail train, giving an arrival in Euston at 8 am. The time penalty incurred by the <b>extra</b> <b>mileage</b> was viewed with disfavour by other partners in the service, particularly the ferry operator which was competing with other routes between Ireland and Britain.|$|E
50|$|By 1840 it {{was obvious}} that the {{disconnected}} local railways in Great Britain must eventually link to form a network; this was already taking shape in England, and much thought was given to connecting the cities of central Scotland with the growing English network. The topography of the intervening land was challenging, with high ground of the Cumbrian Mountains and the Southern Uplands forming natural barriers. The locomotives of the day were not considered capable of hauling trains on a trunk railway over the steep gradients thought to be unavoidable, and many creative schemes were put forward to route round the hilly country. Not all of these schemes were well designed, but the best connected important population centres at the expense of considerable <b>extra</b> <b>mileage.</b> In addition, any route running close to the North Sea coast would have to make the difficult crossings of the River Tyne and the River Tweed.|$|E

40|$|We present Value Elimination, a new {{algorithm}} for Bayesian Inference. Given {{the same}} variable ordering information, Value Elimination can achieve performance that is within a constant factor of variable elimination or recursive conditioning, and on some problems it can perform exponentially better, {{irrespective of the}} variable ordering used by these algorithms.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. In a road network with {{refueling}} and fast charging stations, the minimum-cost driving {{path of a}} {{plug-in hybrid electric vehicle}} (PHEV) depends on factors such as location and availability of refueling/fast charging stations, capacity and cost of PHEV batteries, and driver tolerance towards <b>extra</b> <b>mileage</b> or additional stopping. In this paper, our focus is long-distance trips of PHEVs. We analyze the impacts of battery characteristics, often-overlooked driver preferences and road network features on PHEV travel costs for long-distance trips and compare the results with hybrid electric and conventional vehicles. We investigate the significance of these factors and derive critical managerial insights for shaping the future investment decisions about PHEVs and their infrastructure. In particular, our findings suggest that with a certain level of deployment of fast charging stations, well established cost and emission benefits of PHEVs for the short range trips can be extended to long distance. Drivers׳ stopping intolerance may hamper these benefits; however, increasing battery capacity may help overcome the adverse effects of this intolerance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Since {{the traffic}} {{congestion}} {{become more and}} more serious in modern society due to the sharp increasing of private cars, how to improve the transportation efficiency and utilize the current road network more effectively has become a crucial issue. In this paper, a new dynamic route guidance algorithm was proposed in order to provide travelers humanized “optimal route ” and to alleviate the loss caused by traffic jams. The study built a graph theory model for Beijing’s ring road transportation system, and proposed a evaluation function σ=Vf/[k×(t+m(ρ-ρ 0)) ] to describe the real time complex traffic flow, and realized the route searching by timed recomputation of classic Dijkstra algorithm. Meanwhile, due to the investigation of special features of ring roads, the study improved the priority of ring road nodes during the searching process. Comparing with Dijkstra algorithm, the time-complexity of this new algorithm decreases to 1 /(16 k 2) (k is the number of ring road in the road network), and <b>extra</b> <b>mileage</b> is less than 5 %, which is more effective applying in large scale ring-road networks. The algorithm was realized by C++ language and connected to Google Earth’s map database with easy operation interface. (The operation of the algorithm program was manifested in the appended video...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} congestion {{at major}} hubs and the advantage to passengers of non-stop flights and faster journey times has intensified {{the debate on}} patterns of air service. At {{the same time the}} economics of highly focused networks has been challenged by the availability of very economic smaller capacity long-haul aircraft. The purpose of this research is to value the environmental costs of these two patterns of service: hub-to-hub and hub bypass. Five long-haul markets were evaluated both on a hub to hub and hub by-pass basis. These involved both transatlantic and Europe/Asia flights. It was found that the noise and emissions social cost impact of the hub by-pass networks was significantly lower than the hub to hub in all cases. The difference in environmental costs per passenger ranged between 25 % and 73 %, depending on the concentration of population around the airports {{and the degree to which}} the hub routing involved <b>extra</b> <b>mileage.</b> The difference increasedto a range of 56 % to 113 %, if a stimulation factor of 25 % was applied to the non-stop market.

40|$|Dynamic {{deployment}} is an Emergency Medical Services (EMS) ambulance {{management strategy}} where 911 call demand coverage is maximized continuously through time. Unlike static deployment where dispatched ambulances leave a coverage gap until {{they return to}} their home-base after service, dynamic deployment redeploys idle ambulances to different locations if that leads {{to an increase in}} demand coverage. The purpose of this dissertation was to study dynamic deployment as a viable, beneficial, and cost-effective methodology in managing EMS ambulances and crews. The literature, while rich in studies on static deployment, was lacking when it came to ambulance management strategies like dynamic deployment. Through a discrete-event simulation model, hypothetical EMS systems were simulated under dynamic and static deployment with different demand patterns, demand loads, and system sizes. Dynamic deployment was found to be as good, or often better, in emergency response metrics than static deployment. When EMS systems want to meet a certain response goal, dynamic deployment may enable them to achieve that performance with fewer vehicles than static deployment. While savings in number of vehicles translate to substantial savings in crew wages and vehicular purchasing costs, dynamic deployment may increase operating costs per vehicle because of the <b>extra</b> <b>mileage</b> involved in redeployments. Many EMS systems with average vehicular utilizations of 40 % to 50 % may find, however, that dynamic deployment may be both cost-effective and beneficial in improving response performance. Different redeployment strategies were studied to address the added travel costs of dynamic deployment and a min-sum assignment model was found to decrease redeployment travel the most without impacting response performance. Finally, a procedure and a mathematical model were developed to route vehicles intelligently such that demand coverage is maximized throughout the redeployment process...|$|E

To accomplish picks up here, we have tested the traditional speculation connected with powertrain capacities and plans. Ordinary powertrain arrangements comprise of an inner burning motor working over an extensive variety of torque and pace conditions and a transmission that has, by examination, just a couple of discrete apparatus proportions. The operational rationality of customary powertrains makes it hard to achieve most extreme motor fuel proficiency {{on the grounds that the}} open doors for working at the least fuel utilization or best "brake particular fuel utilization" are confined and by and large don't concur with the torque and rate conditions forced on the motor by the vehicle. Utilizing a CVT-arranged powertrain, the motor works at greatest burden conditions. This permits the motor to work at or close to its best brake particular fuel utilization rate, which implies that the motor is working at its most elevated normal adiabatic efficiencies. For inner ignition motors this would be 36 %, while for diesel motors it is 45 %.
