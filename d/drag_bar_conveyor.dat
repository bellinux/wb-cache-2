5000|$|The album {{represents}} {{a shift in}} style from the delicate, erotic, dancefloor-friendly pop of their earlier records and contains a more eclectic mix of styles as well, from the Spanish-influenced [...] "L'Esqualita" [...] (inspired by the <b>drag</b> <b>bar</b> in New York City of the same name- the actual real name being [...] "La Escuelita") to the rockabilly-tinged [...] "Down in the Subway".

The materials to be processed can be loaded directly from the hopper (direct download) or through the use of a feeder (drum-type feeder, roller, etc.). A simplified method to predict the grate bars surface wear on the strength of a number of assumptions has been developed: normal reaction of the pallet surface to the impact of the batch is assumed constant, equal to the maximum of its value when the pallet is in horizontal position; a layer of the batch moves as a rigid body; surface batch layer sliding velocity as related to the pallet surface is taken medium during the relative motion of the layer and equal to the linear velocity of the pallets; the side faces of the grate bars wear is related to related to the surface wear by linear dependence.
