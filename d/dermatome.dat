5|$|In {{addition}} to completeness of injury, {{the location of}} damage on the spinal cord influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury. Injuries can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (back), lumbar (lower back), or sacral (pelvic) levels. Between each pair of vertebrae, spinal nerves branch off of the spinal cord and carry information to and from specific parts of the body. The location of injury to the spinal cord maps to the body, and the area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve, is called a <b>dermatome.</b> All dermatomes {{below the level of}} injury to the spinal cord may lose sensation.|$|E
5|$|At {{each level}} of the spinal column, spinal nerves branch off from {{either side of the}} spinal cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to {{innervate}} a specific part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a <b>dermatome,</b> and the group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a myotome. The part of the spinal cord that was damaged corresponds to the spinal nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person's level of injury is defined as the lowest level of full sensation and function. Paraplegia occurs when the legs are affected by the spinal cord damage (in thoracic, lumbar, or sacral injuries), and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected (cervical damage).|$|E
25|$|Hand acupuncture, {{developed}} in Korea, centers around assumed reflex zones of the hand. Medical acupuncture attempts to integrate reflexological concepts, the trigger point model, and anatomical insights (such as <b>dermatome</b> distribution) into acupuncture practice, and emphasizes a more formulaic approach to acupuncture point location.|$|E
50|$|An axial line is {{the line}} between two {{adjacent}} <b>dermatomes</b> that are not represented by immediately adjacent spinal levels. Although <b>dermatomes</b> are shown to be discrete segments on dermatomal maps (like in the image opposite), {{they are in fact}} not; adjacent <b>dermatomes</b> overlap with one another. This {{is one of the reasons}} for the variety of different dermatomal maps proposed. However, at axial lines, adjacent <b>dermatomes</b> do not overlap. An example of an axial line would be the line between the S2 and L4 <b>dermatomes</b> on the calf.|$|R

25|$|The {{kidney and}} nervous system {{communicate}} via the renal plexus, whose fibers course along the renal arteries to reach each kidney. Input from the {{sympathetic nervous system}} triggers vasoconstriction in the kidney, thereby reducing renal blood flow. The kidney also receives input from the parasympathetic nervous system, {{by way of the}} renal branches of the vagus nerve; the function of this is yet unclear. Sensory input from the kidney travels to the T10-11 levels of the spinal cord and is sensed in the corresponding <b>dermatome.</b> Thus, pain in the flank region may be referred from corresponding kidney.|$|E
25|$|Angina pectoris can {{be quite}} painful, but many {{patients}} with angina complain of chest discomfort rather than actual pain: the discomfort is usually described as a pressure, heaviness, tightness, squeezing, burning, or choking sensation. Apart from chest discomfort, anginal pains may also be experienced in the epigastrium (upper central abdomen), back, neck area, jaw, or shoulders. This is explained by the concept of referred pain, and {{is due to the}} fact that the spinal level that receives visceral sensation from the heart simultaneously receives cutaneous sensation from parts of the skin specified by that spinal nerve's <b>dermatome,</b> without an ability to discriminate the two. Typical locations for referred pain are arms (often inner left arm), shoulders, and neck into the jaw. Angina is typically precipitated by exertion or emotional stress. It is exacerbated by having a full stomach and by cold temperatures. Pain may be accompanied by breathlessness, sweating, and nausea in some cases. In this case, the pulse rate and the blood pressure increases. Chest pain lasting only a few seconds is normally not angina (such as precordial catch syndrome).|$|E
500|$|A {{section of}} skin innervated through a {{specific}} {{part of the}} spine is called a <b>dermatome,</b> and injury {{to that part of}} the spine can cause pain, numbness, or a loss of sensation in the related areas. Paraesthesia, a tingling or burning sensation in affected areas of the skin, is another symptom. A person with a lowered level of consciousness may show a response to a painful stimulus above a certain point but not below it.|$|E

500|$|SCI is also {{classified}} {{by the degree}} of impairment. [...] The International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI), published by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA), is widely used to document sensory and motor impairments following SCI. It is based on neurological responses, touch and pinprick sensations tested in each <b>dermatome,</b> and strength of the muscles that control key motions {{on both sides of}} the body. [...] Muscle strength is scored on a scale of 0–5 according to the table on the right, and sensation is graded on a scale of 0–2: 0 is no sensation, 1 is altered or decreased sensation, and 2 is full sensation. [...] Each side of the body is graded independently.|$|E
2500|$|Dermatomes are similar; however, a <b>dermatome</b> only {{specifies}} {{the area}} {{served by a}} spinal nerve. In some cases, the <b>dermatome</b> is less specific (when a spinal nerve is the source {{for more than one}} cutaneous nerve), and in other cases it is more specific (when a cutaneous nerve is derived from multiple spinal nerves.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{onion skin}} {{distribution}} {{differs from the}} <b>dermatome</b> distribution of the peripheral branches of the fifth nerve. Lesions which destroy lower areas of the spinal trigeminal nucleus (but spare higher areas) preserve pain-temperature sensation in the nose (V1), upper lip (V2) and mouth (V3) and remove pain-temperature sensation from the forehead (V1), cheeks (V2) and chin (V3). Although analgesia in this distribution is [...] "nonphysiologic" [...] {{in the traditional sense}} (because it crosses several dermatomes), this analgesia is found in humans after surgical sectioning of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nucleus.|$|E
40|$|Somatosensory evoked {{potentials}} (SEPs) {{in response}} to painful laser stimuli were measured in a patient with a unilateral sensory deficit due to radiculopathy at cervical levels C 7 and C 8. Laser evoked potentials (LEPs) were compared with SEPs using standard electrical stimulation of median and ulnar nerves at the wrist and mechanical stimulation of the fingertips {{by means of a}} mechanical stimulator. Early and late ulnar and median nerve SEPs were normal. Mechanical stimulation resulted in w shaped early SEPs from all five fingertips with some degree of abnormality at the fourth and fifth digits of the affected hand. Late LEPs were completely absent for stimulations at affected <b>dermatomes</b> and normal in the unaffected control <b>dermatomes.</b> The border between skin areas with normal or absent LEPs was very sharp and fitted the <b>dermatomes</b> of intact C 6 and damaged C 7 and C 8 nerve roots. It is suggested that pain <b>dermatomes</b> are narrower than tactile <b>dermatomes</b> because thin fibres of the nociceptive system, activated by laser stimuli, probably do not overlap between adjacent spinal segments to the same extent as thick fibres of the mechanoreceptive system, activated by standard electrical or mechanical stimulation...|$|R

2500|$|The term [...] "sciatica" [...] {{describes}} a symptom—pain along the sciatic nerve pathway—rather than a specific condition, illness, or disease. Some {{use it to}} mean any pain starting in the lower back and going down the leg. Others use the term more specifically to mean a nerve dysfunction caused by compression {{of one or more}} lumbar or sacral nerve roots from a spinal disc herniation. though in this second use it is a diagnosis (i.e., it indicates a cause and effect). [...] Pain typically occurs in the distribution of a <b>dermatome</b> and goes below the knee to the foot. It may be associated with neurological dysfunction, such as weakness. The pain is characteristically of a shooting type, quickly traveling along the course of the nerve.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: After {{spinal cord}} injury, contact heat evoked {{potentials}} (CHEPs) {{may represent a}} means to refine the clinical assessment of sensory function from each spinal cord segment by quantifying nociception, including conduction along the spinothalamic tract. METHODS: : The influence of stimulation site (i. e., <b>dermatomes)</b> on CHEPs and thermal thresholds in 19 healthy subjects (mean age, 45. 2 ± 18. 3 years) divided into 2 age classes (younger subjects, n = 10; mean age, 28. 8 ± 5. 2 years; older subjects, n = 9; mean age, 63. 4 ± 3. 4 years) at 5 different <b>dermatomes</b> (C 4, C 5, C 6, C 8, and T 4) was assessed. RESULTS: : In terms of distance from the body midline (i. e., spinal cord entry), there was a reduction in CHEP amplitudes from proximal (C 4 and T 4) to distal (C 6 and C 8) <b>dermatomes</b> with a corresponding reduction in nociceptive perception (i. e., pain threshold and rating). Within primary and secondary cortical sensory areas, including areas associated with affective noxious processing, the cortical source density analysis showed a similar current density distribution between C 4 and C 8 <b>dermatomes</b> but consistent higher current densities for C 4. CONCLUSIONS: : The study supports CHEPs as a feasible tool for assessing discrete <b>dermatomes</b> corresponding to spinal cord segments. The {{results suggest that the}} proximodistal pattern in the intensity of perceived pain and CHEP amplitudes is likely attributable to the distribution of heat nociceptors and the increase in conduction distance from proximal to distal <b>dermatomes.</b> The present findings emphasize on the importance that if patients are assessed segment by segment, the underlying topographical differences need to be accounted for...|$|R
