40|$|Most {{theories}} {{of reading and}} writing posit a level of representation that codes abstract letter identities (ALIs) independent of the <b>font,</b> <b>case,</b> and even modality in which the letter was presented or produced (e. g., Caramazza & Hillis, 1990). Most cognitive theories assume that ALIs are critical for mediating between peripheral (e. g., processing visual shapes, executing motor plans) and central (e. g., accessing semantic or lexical information) written language processes. We present {{a case study of}} an individual with a severe impairment in processing ALIs, in order to examine the role of ALIs in reading and writing. Case study CH was a 52 year-old male with 17 years of education who suffered a stroke five years prior to testing resulting in extensive damage to the left temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. Auditory word processing was intact, but he was impaired in spoken picture naming, producing many semantic or picture description errors. Single-letter processing tasks CH was administered tasks that probed his ability to process letter-shape and letter-identity information. His performance on these tasks is reported in Table 1. Tasks that tapped into letter-shape processing included direct copy, copying letters from a tactile presentation, within-case same-different matching, pseudoletter decision, and a mental rotation tasks that required deciding whether a letter at an odd orientation was facing the correct direction or was mirror reversed. CH was unimpaired on all of these tasks, indicating no impairment in processing the shapes of letters either in perception or production. Tasks that tap into abstract letter identity processing included naming letters from a visual or tactile presentation, letter writing-to-dictation, cross-case same-different matching, direct copy transcoding, and copy transcoding letters from a tactile presentation. CH was severely impaired on all letter-identity processing tasks. Given this pattern of performance, we conclude that CH has an impairment in processing ALIs but not letter-shape information. Whole word processing tasks CH was also given a series of whole word processing tasks. He was given a set of 80 words and 20 words to spell (both oral and written), read aloud and recognize via oral spelling. His impairment in many of these tasks was striking (Oral Spelling: 0 / 100, Written Spelling: 2 / 100; Recognizing Orally Spelled Words: 0 / 100). However, his single word reading was surprisingly intact; he read 47 / 80 words correctly (59 %), but not a single nonword. Furthermore, many of his reading errors were semantic (e. g. LAST → “end”) suggesting that the approximate meaning could be extracted from the written word. Discussion CH’s acquired dyslexia and dysgraphia left him with a profound impairment in processing abstract letter identities. This impairment affected his ability to process strings of letters in a variety of tasks; for example nonword reading, spelling, recognizing orally spelled words. However, while impaired, his single word reading was surprisingly good given his single letter impairment, suggesting an additional route to word meaning from visually-presented familiar words that does not require abstract letter identities...|$|E

It provides strong support for previous reports indicating the neural independence of different types of case and font-specific letter-shape information; it provides evidence that letter-shape production does not require explicit access to information about the visual attributes of letter shapes and, finally, it reveals the possibility of interaction between processes involved in letter-shape production and perception...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Whenever {{a skilled}} reader is {{presented}} with a printed word, brain activity {{can be observed in}} a well-delineated area of the left fusiform gyrus [1 [...] 4], which is consistently found at the same location in Talairach space (about x=# 42, Y=# 57, z=# 6), {{with a standard deviation of}} only about 0. 5 cm [1]. This activation generally falls on the mesial edge of or within the occipito-temporal sulcus, about halfway along the antero-posterior axis of the fusiform gyrus. Our working hypothesis is that the left fusiform gyrus contains a visual word form area (VWFA) which computes an invariant structural representation of the visual word as an ordered sequence of abstract letter identities invariant for size, <b>font,</b> and <b>case</b> [5, 6]. In support of this hypothesis, the VWFA responds with the same intensity whether words are presented in the left or in the right hemifield [1] (location invariance), and show equal repetition priming within and across case (case invariance) [4].

40|$|This article reads Graham Rawle's collage novel Woman's World (2005) by {{utilizing}} the literal and metaphoric {{meanings of the}} facsimile as critical tools. Woman's World is an assemblage of circa 40, 000 fragments cut and pasted from over a 1000 copies of British women's magazines of the early 1960 s. These snippets are reproduced in facsimile and thus feature a jerky variety of <b>font</b> types, <b>cases,</b> and sizes. Woman's World does not only present a facsimile of its found graphic materials but it also studies, in my reading, the "facsimile" (similarizing, imitating, copying) qualities of gender identification, adopted discourses, (cross-) dressing, and the novel's own construction. The "varieties of similarity" within the facsimile that the novel presents relate to its thematic concerns. The visible outlines of the materials mark breaches in the concepts of gender and discourse as unified entities. The forms and degrees of facsimile also seem to pluralize, and relativize, {{the very idea of}} making similar and thus the very concept of identity—typographic, gender, or other...|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the new {{extensions}} {{is to provide a}} simpler and unambiguous metasyntax. In terms of simplicity, BNF’s metanotation definitely does not help to make the metasyntax easier-to-read as the open-end and close-end metasymbols appear too abundantly. In terms of ambiguity, BNF’s metanotation generates unnecessary complexity when quotation marks, apostrophes, less-than signs or greater-than signs come to serve as terminal symbols, which they often do. The extended metasyntax utilizes properties such as <b>case,</b> <b>font,</b> and code position of characters to reduce unnecessary aforementioned complexity. Moreover, some metalanguages use fonted separator categories to incorporate metasyntactic features for layout conventions, which are not formally supported by BNF.|$|R

500|$|In {{the early}} 1840s Sharpe was invited by John Fletcher, his future brother-in-law, {{to build a}} church near Fletcher's home in Little Bolton. [...] Fletcher {{was the owner of}} a coal mine at Ladyshore, Little Lever, {{overlooking}} the River Irwell and the Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal. [...] He had been using the clay which came up with the coal to make refractory bricks for furnaces, and suggested its use for building the church, as it was much cheaper than stone. Sharpe then designed the first church in England to be built, in whole or in part, from this material (terracotta), StStephen and All Martyrs, Lever Bridge (1842–44). [...] As terracotta is commonly used to make plant pots and the like, Sharpe himself called this church, and its two successors, [...] "the pot churches", a nickname that has stuck. [...] The advantages of terracotta were its cheapness, its sturdiness as a building material, {{and the fact that it}} could be moulded into almost any shape. [...] It could therefore be used for walls, towers, arches, and arcades in a church, for the detailed decoration of capitals and pinnacles, and also, as at StStephen's, for the furnishings, such as the altar, pulpit, <b>font,</b> organ <b>case,</b> and the pew ends. [...] Apart from the foundations and the rubble within the walls, StStephen and All Martyrs was constructed entirely from terracotta. [...] The following year, a second church was built using the same material, Trinity Church, Rusholme, south of Manchester (1845–46), built and paid for by Thomas Carill-Worsley, who lived at nearby Platt Hall. [...] In this case, although the exterior is in terracotta, the interior is of plastered brick. [...] The church was consecrated in June 1846, although at the time work on the spire had not yet started and several other features were incomplete, including the heating, seating, and floor tiling.|$|R
40|$|AbstractReading deficits are {{a common}} early feature of the {{degenerative}} syndrome posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) but are poorly understood even at the single word level. The current study evaluated the reading accuracy and speed of 26 PCA patients, 17 typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD) patients and 14 healthy controls on a corpus of 192 single words in which the following perceptual properties were manipulated systematically: inter-letter spacing, font size, length, <b>font</b> type, <b>case</b> and confusability. PCA reading was significantly less accurate and slower than tAD patients and controls, with performance significantly adversely affected by increased letter spacing, size, length and font (cursive < non-cursive), and characterised by visual errors (69 % of all error responses). By contrast, tAD and control accuracy rates were at or near ceiling, letter spacing was the only perceptual factor to influence reading speed {{in the same direction}} as controls, and, in contrast to PCA patients, control reading was faster for larger font sizes. The inverse size effect in PCA (less accurate reading of large than small font size print) was associated with lower grey matter volume in the right superior parietal lobule. Reading accuracy was associated with impairments of early visual (especially crowding), visuoperceptual and visuospatial processes. However, these deficits were not causally related to a universal impairment of reading as some patients showed preserved reading for small, unspaced words despite grave visual deficits. Rather, the impact of specific types of visual dysfunction on reading was found to be (con) text specific, being particularly evident for large, spaced, lengthy words. These findings improve the characterisation of dyslexia in PCA, shed light on the causative and associative factors, and provide clear direction for the development of reading aids and strategies to maximise and sustain reading ability in the early stages of disease...|$|R
