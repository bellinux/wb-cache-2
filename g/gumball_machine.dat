They work as groundskeepers at a park, and spend their days trying to avoid work and entertain themselves by any means. This is much to the chagrin of their manager/boss Benson (a <b>gumball</b> <b>machine)</b> and their coworker Skips (a yeti), but to the delight of their (other) manager/boss Pops (a man with a lollipop-shaped head). Other coworkers include an overweight green man called Muscle Man, and a ghost called Hi-Five Ghost.|$|E

On the Dick Clark show in 1978, he played a chewing gum machine and a slot machine. He was also able to create imaginary characters. Alfred Hitchcock compared him to Charlie Chaplin, and critic John Crosby felt [...] "he could wrench laughter out of you with the violence of his great eyes and the sheer immensity of his parody."

50|$|Most <b>gumball</b> <b>machines</b> have {{a simple}} {{mechanism}} for dispensing the gumball, {{to the point of}} the actual dispensation being largely invisible (after turning the handle the gumball is deposited behind the door). However, some <b>gumball</b> <b>machines</b> have more elaborate methods. Most of them utilize the potential energy of the gumball's location above the base, by, for instance, causing it to roll down a spiral ramp, or a set of diagonal disks (each one is tilted in the opposite direction than the preceding one) with holes in lowest point. The most elaborate mechanisms also use electricity to power various forms of transit for the gumball on its way to dispensation (e.g. lifts and pulleys), as well as ramps and drops.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{there were}} vending {{machines}} for stick or block shaped gum {{as early as}} 1888, the first machines to carry actual gumballs were not seen until 1907 (probably released first by the Thomas Adams Gum Co. in the United States).

50|$|GameRoom Magazine is an American {{magazine}} {{focusing on}} game room products (pinball, arcade games, jukeboxes, etc.). It {{was founded in}} 1988 by Dave C. and Donna Cooper of New Albany, Indiana, and was created to serve the growing market of coin-op memorabilia collectors, hobbyists, and restorers. The first issue, dated January 1989, focused on jukeboxes.

50|$|The {{profit margins}} in the bulk candy {{business}} {{can be quite}} high - gumballs, for instance, can be purchased in bulk for around 2 cents per piece and sold for 25 cents in <b>gumball</b> <b>machines</b> in the U.S., and other countries. Gumballs and candy have a relatively long shelf life, enabling vending machine operators to manage many machines without too much time or cost involved. In addition, the machines are typically inexpensive compared to soft drink or snack machines, which often require power and sometimes refrigeration to work. Many operators donate {{a percentage of the}} profits to charity so that locations will allow them to place the machines for free.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} {{widebody}} playfield (being almost {{as wide as}} the backbox of the machine), these games often include extra gimmicks and toys which would add to the gameplay (e.g., the <b>gumball</b> <b>machine</b> in Twilight Zone, the dual Phazers in Star Trek: The Next Generation or the dual gamemode playfield of Judge Dredd).|$|E

Each level gets harder and only through {{reflexes}} and cunning will you make it out alive! Though you are quick and seem to be very resilient to damage (as you have lived your whole life in shame and have a tough outer skin towards outside hostility), you are not invincible.
