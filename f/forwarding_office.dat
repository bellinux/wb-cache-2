25|$|The {{provision}} of a mail service to soldiers remained {{an ad hoc}} affair until 1882. In 1881 a rebellion broke out in Egypt which threatened Britain's passage to India through Suez. In response a British Expeditionary Force was sent to Egypt {{in the same year}} under the command of Sir Garnet Wolseley. This gave Lieutenant Colonel du Plat Taylor the opportunity to raise the matter of the postal corps again and it was agreed that an Army Post Office Corps (APOC) should be formed. Mails from Britain were despatched 3 times a week via the 'overland route' through France to Alexandria. The Army Post Offices offered a letter and parcel service and sold stamps and postal orders. In addition to the mail services, a free parcel service from the Naval docks at Deptford was also set up. These parcels travelled by Government store ships and transports. This service was the forerunner of the Military <b>Forwarding</b> <b>Office</b> (MFO) service which still exists today.|$|E

The preponderance of the minor offices of the Cancellaria were abrogated and its faculties were reduced only to the expedition of Papal bulls for Consistorial benefices, erection of new dioceses and chapters, and other more important ecclesiastical affairs that required various forms of Apostolic letters. Thus Pope St. Pius X restored the title of [...] "Chancellor of Holy Roman Church" [...] from the previous [...] "Vice Chancellor" [...] (see section below). The cardinalatial title of the Chancellor remained the Basilica di San Lorenzo in Damaso, {{as it had been}} since 5 July 1532. However, the Chancellor retained little of his former authority. He acted as notary of the cardinalatial consistories and directed the office of the Cancellaria Apostolica.|$|E
