5|$|Many critics <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> film, {{comparing}} it unfavorably with the films of John Waters and criticizing the colorful production design.

5|$|They wrote frequently, and by March 1920, Scott {{had sent}} Zelda his mother's ring, {{and the two}} had become engaged. Many of Zelda's friends and {{members of her family}} were wary of the relationship, as they did not approve of Scott's {{excessive}} drinking, and Zelda's Episcopalian family <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> fact that he was a Catholic.|$|E
5|$|Around 1779 Priestley and Shelburne had a rupture, {{the precise}} reasons for which remain unclear. Shelburne blamed Priestley's health, while Priestley claimed Shelburne had no further use for him. Some contemporaries speculated that Priestley's {{outspokenness}} had hurt Shelburne's political career. Schofield {{argues that the}} most likely reason was Shelburne's recent marriage to Louisa Fitzpatrick—apparently, she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Priestleys. Although Priestley considered moving to America, he eventually accepted Birmingham New Meeting's offer to be their minister.|$|E

5|$|David {{challenges}} Elijah with {{an incident}} {{from his childhood}} when he almost drowned. Elijah suggests that the incident highlights the common comic trope whereby superheroes often have one weakness; he contends David's might be water. While surveying the stored wreckage of the train crash that he survived, David recalls the car accident that ended his athletics career, remembering that he was unharmed and ripped a door off the car {{in order to save}} Audrey. David used the accident as an excuse to quit football because Audrey <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> violence of the sport.|$|E
5|$|Fan {{interest}} in women's wrestling sunk once {{again as the}} year closed, and Sing tired of working there. Moreover, Faye was frustrated with her gimmick. WWF management asked her not to perform the same power moves as the male wrestlers, so instead, Faye was forced to act as comic relief. After a year with the company, Sing asked for a release from her contract. She briefly returned to Japan, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> new system, which did not guarantee payouts.|$|E
5|$|Geldray {{worked in}} the casinos of Reno, {{appearing}} with Sarah Vaughan and Billy Daniels; he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> city, so returned to Los Angeles. In 1962 he met a divorcee with three children, Susan Deforio; the couple married that year, and in 1964 they had a son, Philip. Geldray worked for a period as a sales assistant in a clothes shop before becoming the regional sales supervisor for The Christian Science Monitor.|$|E

5|$|Jarrell's {{relationship}} with his mother became closer once his father {{and one of his}} brothers left to work at a shipyard during World War II. His father died of malaria while working there. While in high school, Jarrell helped his mother tend the farm, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> work. After graduating from high school, he joined the Army, was stationed at Fort Polk, Louisiana and served briefly in Korea. At Fort Polk he became company artist and made extra money designing shirts and making paintings for fellow soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Lemkin's script, titled Superman Reborn, {{featured}} Lois Lane and Clark Kent with relationship troubles, and Superman's {{battle with}} Doomsday. When Superman professes his love to Lois, his life force jumps between them {{just as he}} dies, giving Lois a virgin birth. Their child, who grows 21-years-old in three weeks, becomes the resurrected Superman and saves the world. Warner Bros. <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> script because of the similar underlying themes with Bruce Wayne's obligations of heroism found in Batman Forever.|$|E
5|$|Silver City Airways {{moved to}} Lympne in 1948, {{operating}} Bristol Freighter Mk.21 aircraft and an aerial car ferry to Le Touquet started on 13 July 1948. The air ferry {{was the idea}} of Griffith J Powell, who wanted to holiday in France but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> ferry. Bristol lent an aircraft for an experiment on 7 July 1948. The first car was Powell's Armstrong Siddeley 16 which was carried by G-AGVC.The Bristol Freighter Mk.21 could carry two cars. Although only 170 cars were carried in 1948, experience was gained.|$|E

5|$|The first sixteen {{episodes of}} the season aired on Tuesdays at 9:00pm ET in the United States, after which the series was rescheduled to Thursdays. Overall, the season {{averaged}} about 3.81 million American viewers. The season gained many award nominations, among them two Primetime Emmy Awards for work done on the pilot episode. While some critics <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> mostly anthology-like format, others praised the show for the emotional moments and noted the brotherly chemistry between the lead actors.|$|E
5|$|Whitlock {{is the son}} of Raymond and Genny Whitlock. Whitlock was {{originally}} going to be named Sergio Nehemiah Whitlock, but his grandmother <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> name.

Whitlock graduated from Wake Forest with a Health and Exercise Science major.|$|E
5|$|Although Batman Returns was a {{financial}} success, Warner Bros. felt the film {{should have made}} more money. The studio decided to change {{the direction of the}} Batman film series to be more mainstream. Joel Schumacher replaced Tim Burton as director, while Burton decided to stay on as producer. However, Michael Keaton <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> new direction the film series was heading in, and was replaced by Val Kilmer as Batman. Chris O'Donnell was introduced as Robin, Jim Carrey starred as The Riddler, while Tommy Lee Jones starred as Two-Face. Filming started in September 1994, and Schumacher encountered problems communicating with Kilmer and Jones. Batman Forever was released on June 16, 1995 with financial success, earning over $350 million worldwide and three Academy Award nominations, but the film was met with mixed reviews from critics.|$|E

5|$|Beginning as a supporter, Greeley {{soon became}} disillusioned with President Johnson, whose Reconstruction {{policies}} allowed the quick formation of state governments without provision for suffrage for the freedman. When Congress convened and gradually {{took control of}} Reconstruction, Greeley generally supported their actions, favoring universal male suffrage and, his anger against the Confederates having cooled, amnesty. While Greeley generally supported the Radical Republicans, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> harshness of Thaddeus Stevens. Greeley ran for Congress in 1866, but lost badly, and for Senate in the legislative election held in early 1867, to be defeated by Roscoe Conkling.|$|E
5|$|In 1669, Anna Maria Luisa was {{considered}} as a potential bride to Louis, le Grand Dauphin, the heir-apparent of Louis XIV of France. Cosimo III <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> idea of a French marriage, and never devoted himself fully to the cause (she was later rejected). Instead, Cosimo offered her to his first choice, Peter II of Portugal. Peter's ministers, fearing that Princess Anna Maria Luisa would dominate Peter II and fearing she might have inherited Marguerite Louise’s manner, declined. In fact, contemporaries thought her traits to {{be a combination of}} those of her father and paternal grandmother, Vittoria della Rovere.|$|E
5|$|O'Donoghue complained {{directly}} to Belushi {{that he thought}} his parody of Shatner during the dress rehearsals was inadequate and needed much improvement. Further, actor Chevy Chase was annoyed that he was satirizing Leonard Nimoy as Spock; he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> idea of playing second-fiddle to Belushi. During all of the rehearsals, Chase attempted to attract more attention to his character's role and dominate the scene. Just prior to the actual on-air performance of the sketch, O'Donoghue admonished Belushi and implored him to perform an effective parody. Belushi's dress rehearsal performance had worried executives {{so much that they}} had discussed canceling the entire sketch altogether.|$|E

5|$|Studio {{executives}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> {{film and}} restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign {{to try to}} reduce anticipated losses. Fight Club {{failed to meet the}} studio's expectations at the box office and initially received polarizing reactions from critics, becoming {{one of the most controversial}} and talked-about films of the year. Critics praised the acting, directing, themes and messages but debated the explicit violence and moral ambiguity. Over time, however, reception towards the film has become largely positive with critics and audiences, finding critical and commercial success with its DVD release, which established Fight Club as a cult film. It is now regarded by many as one of the greatest films of the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The First Nations in {{the north}} {{typically}} had some prior experience of Europeans, for example through contact with the Hudson's Bay Company, and there was little conflict between the police and these native communities, and few crimes committed. The First Nations typically <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> police, however, and often blamed them for wider government policies; for their part, the mounted police often regarded the First Nations with contempt. By comparison, the mounted police got on much better with the Inuit, who had seen far less contact with Europeans. The force generally took a more liberal, paternalistic attitude towards them, often applying informal justice rather than official laws when the occasional Inuit crime was committed. Members of the First Nations and Inuit were employed to drive police dog sleds and cook for their patrols.|$|E
5|$|The Free City of Danzig made Hitler {{an honorary}} {{citizen of the}} city as a {{birthday}} gift. Hitler received the citizenship papers from the hands of Albert Forster, the city's Nazi leader. Political and military tension between Germany and Poland was heightened at the time, and Time Magazine reported the possibility of Danzig being returned to Germany. Martin Bormann, Hitler's private secretary, had the Eagle's Nest constructed as the Nazi Party's birthday gift. Hitler, however, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> location, as he had a fear of heights. Because of his indigestion, Hitler did not drink alcohol, so a Munich brewery created a special batch of low alcohol beer for his birthday. The brew became a regular order.|$|E
