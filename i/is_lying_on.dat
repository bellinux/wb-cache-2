5|$|All battleships are top {{heavy and}} tend to settle upside down when they sink. Arkansas settled upside down, but a 1989 diver's sketch of the wreck shows hardly any of the {{starboard}} side of the hull, making it look like the ship <b>is</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> her side. Most of the starboard side is present, but severely compacted.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} {{a shot of the}} outside view of The Confidante hotel and two flamingos. In the next scene, and {{in the context of the}} track, Lipa <b>is</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> a bed, {{thinking}} of giving her ex a second chance, while her friends are by her side. As the song continues, the artist heads towards the phone to answer his call, but is stopped by one of her friends. Then, she keeps receiving advice from the women, but manages to escape to the hallway. There, they perform a choreography, and return to the room. In the next scenes, the women start a sleepover, brushing each other's hair and applying lipstick on each other. They change their outfits and head towards the pool, where they walk over the water.|$|E

25|$|Halyards (sometimes haulyards), {{are used}} to raise sails and control luff tension. In large yachts the halyard returns to the deck but in small racing {{dinghies}} {{the head of the}} sail is attached by a short line {{to the head of the}} mast while the boat <b>is</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> its gunwale.|$|E
25|$|Snoopy <b>is</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> {{top of his}} doghouse, {{relaxing}} vacantly and peacefully. He {{begins to}} daydream about being a wild jungle beast. In a few minutes, however, he is back to his peaceful state ("Snoopy"). Linus enters, holding his blanket and sucking his thumb. Lucy and Sally show up and mock him for this habit. Linus decides to abandon his blanket and move on, only to come running back to it in desperation. After the girls leave, Linus daydreams of a blanket fantasy where everyone can relax with their blankets ("My Blanket and Me"). Lucy later tells him that she would someday {{like to be a}} queen. However, Linus tells her that she can't and she threatens to punch him. Sally gets a C for her pathetic coat-hanger sculpture.|$|E

25|$|About 90% of {{the time}} sciatica {{is due to a}} spinal disc {{herniation}} pressing on one of the lumbar or sacral nerve roots. Other problems that may result in sciatica include spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis, piriformis syndrome, pelvic tumors, and compression by a baby's head during pregnancy. The straight-leg-raising test is often helpful in diagnosis. The test is positive if, when the leg is raised while a person <b>is</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> their back, pain shoots below the knee. In most cases medical imaging is not needed. Exceptions to this are when bowel or bladder function is affected, there is significant loss of feeling or weakness, symptoms are long standing, or there is a concern of a tumor or infection. Conditions that may present similarly are diseases of the hip and early herpes zoster before the rash appears.|$|E
25|$|The first scroll, {{which is}} {{considered}} the most famous, depicts various animals (frogs, rabbits and monkeys) frolicking {{as if they were}} human. There is no writing on any of the scrolls; they consist of pictures only. The first scroll is also the largest, with a length of 11 meters (36ft) and 30cm (1ft) wide. As the first scroll is opened, rabbits and monkeys are bathing and swimming in a lake, moving on past the mountains, cliffs and trees are rabbits and frogs making bow and arrows. Further more, more rabbits and frogs are bringing pots and boxes to a (currently) unknown event. Frogs and rabbits pass by monks with their cattle (wild boar, sika deer) and a monkey runs away, supposedly stealing, and being chased by a rabbit with a long stick, further more a frog <b>is</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> the floor who could have possibly been knocked over by the thief. Nearby, a celebration has started with two frogs dancing, and a group of animals having a conversation. Not too far from the celebration are animals wrestling and fighting and two monkeys holding a box. Far from the celebration are a group of animals at a funeral and a frog praying in front of a frog shaped Budai as the scroll closes.|$|E

500|$|The {{folds of}} the bed sheets echo the goddess's {{physical}} form, and are rendered to emphasise the sweeping curves of her body. The composition mainly uses shades of red, white, and grey, which are used even in Venus's skin; although {{the effect of this}} simple colour scheme has been much praised, recent technical analysis has shown that the grey sheet was originally a [...] "deep mauve", that has now faded. The luminescent colours used in Venus's skin, applied with [...] "smooth, creamy, blended handling", contrast with the dark greys and black of the silk she <b>is</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on,</b> and with the brown of the wall behind her face.|$|E
500|$|At the {{reception}} of Evelyn and Teddy's wedding, Charlie still wants to marry Courtney, his new stepsister, and decides {{to go up to}} his room with her. When they lie down on the bed, in the dark, Courtney discovers that she <b>is</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> something, when Charlie turns on the light he finds Teddy lying dead on his bed with his pants around his knees, and lipstick on his [...] "Hoo Hoo". When Charlie tells Alan, they know they have an even bigger problem: telling their mother. After pulling Evelyn away from the piano, they tell her and she then cashes in their honeymoon tickets for a trip for one to Fiji before calling the police.|$|E
500|$|At [...] in length, the {{reclining}} {{image is}} the largest statue in Gal Vihara, and {{also one of the}} largest sculptures in Southeast Asia. It depicts the parinirvana of the Buddha, who <b>is</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> his right side with the right arm supporting the head on a bolster, while the left arm lies along the body and thigh. The palm of the right hand and the soles of the feet have a single lotus flower carved on them. Charles Godakumbure, a former Commissioner of the Archaeological Department of Sri Lanka, has stated that the bolster upon which the Buddha rests his head has been so well carved that it looks like a cotton stuffed pillow rather than one carved from rock. The upper footthe left foot of the imageis slightly withdrawn to indicate that the image depicts that the Buddha has attained parinirvana, and is not merely lying down. Unlike the other images, the reclining image does not have a decorated pedestal, and lies on levelled bare rock. On the wall behind the image, several sockets have been carved into the rock, as well as the remains of two stone columns, suggesting that its now missing image house had a wooden roof.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Ferreira walking towards a blue {{projector}} screen, wearing black sunglasses, a black {{jacket and a}} transparent, fishnet-pattern top. Ferreira stops and removes the jacket slowly {{as a group of}} voyeurs observes her. During her act, she continuously looks towards a man with shades and long hair, who sips a drink while watching Ferreira. Outside the nightclub, she is seen again with that man—her apparent love interest—as they kiss each other and involve themselves physically. They reencounter in a black room where Ferreira sticks an ice pick on his face; in response, he slaps her, to which she smiles and they start kissing again. After they reenter the nightclub, another man kisses her, while her love interest looks surprised. The latter walks away and finds a woman with whom he starts dancing and kissing, much to Ferreira's sadness. The next morning, she wakes up in a grass field with red marks on her face while holding the ice pick, which is now covered in blood. In a different setting, the man, who <b>is</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> a bed, sees his stomach cut with the word [...] "not", dripping blood as well. Spins Marc Hogan found the video too [...] "focused on Ferreira's model" [...] abilities to [...] "complement the song effectively".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sarah Chatfield, who {{wanted to do a}} Tom and Jerry-like video, where the human character is cut off at the waist. Hence Allen {{was not going to be}} part of it originally. However, she did appear on the video. The singer declared on her official blog that, I did a video shoot for the next single, which is Alfie, and that was quite a lot of fun, Alfie was played by a puppet and the whole thing looks like an episode of a mixture Tom and Jerry and Roger Rabbit, you'll understand when you see it. The whole day was a pleasurable experience [...] The video starts off with an opening title parodying Looney Tunes and shows Allen in the kitchen preparing a cup of tea, while Alfie, impersonated by a puppet, smokes in his miniature bedroom, watching television. The singer enters the room and takes away his bong, as he unsuccessfully tries to get it back. Next, Allen irons his tuxedo and marks a job announcement called [...] "The Puppet Show" [...] in the newspaper, as the lyric [...] "You need to get a job because the bills need to get paid" [...] is sung. Meanwhile, Alfie is in his bed, staring at a magazine in which there are undressed dolls, titled [...] "Roxy & Babs get it on!" [...] and proceeds to masturbate. Allen walks in on him with the newspaper and suit as he does so, but immediately exits out of embarrassment. With the start of the bridge, puppet birds sing outside the home, while Alfie sneaks out of his room and tries to get beer out of the refrigerator, but is ultimately caught by Allen. She then takes off his [...] "stupid fitted cap", as he scrawls a picture of her, which is also the cover of [...] "Littlest Things". The final scene happens at night, in the kitchen, where Allen <b>is</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> the floor, watching her brother dance. After the last lyrics, [...] "Please don't despair, my dear, mon frere" [...] is sung, he punches her and the video ends.|$|E
500|$|Three months later, the EPB {{issued a}} joint press release with the PRT and the PRTP announcing {{the death of}} one of its members, William Pintado Burgos. After {{emphasizing}} that he had joined the armed resistance from a young age as a believer in independence and socialism, the organizations proceeded to posthumously grant him the title of Commander of the Puerto Rican Revolution, which is only granted to those that are deemed to have [...] "stood firm and battled the motherland's enemy". Months later, on the birthday of Ramón Emeterio Betances, the EBP joined Jornada Betances in a homage to the Puerto Rican students involved in the protests against the Fortuño administration. Remembering that September 23, 1868, is now celebrated as [...] "the birth of the Puerto Rican nation", having been the date of the Cry of Lares when Betances and several other revolted against Spain and proclaimed the first Republic of Puerto Rico under Francisco Ramírez Medina, the group insisted {{that it was time to}} do the same as that day. Citing Pedro Albizu Campos's phrase [...] "it's difficult to give a speech while the mother <b>is</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> bed and there is a killer prowling", the Macheteros anthropomorphized the influence of the United States as that murderer and labeled the Via Verde project and cases of government corruption as examples of actions being taken against the motherland, urging the public to mimic the actions of Lares. Blaming Fortuño, Figueroa Sancha and Fraticelli for a violent response to the UPR strike, the EPB congratulated the students for precipitating a negotiation procedure. Despite this, the organization urged the public to continue its resistance against the measures adopted by the Fortuño administration. The Macheteros also informed that they were [...] "gathering strength, preparing the stage and studying" [...] its opponents, quoting Betances' strategy of patiently and convertly planning every revolutionary action before executing them. The group stated that public education would be defended by [...] "an army of students and communities". The EBP concluded its statement by warning that [...] "the enemy was to be confronted with proper planning and intelligence [...] knowing when to strike". In lobbying for an unified national front, the Macheteros insisted that to accomplish independence the only way to do it was by following the armed resistance promoted by Betances, Albizu, Corretjer and Ojeda Ríos.|$|E
