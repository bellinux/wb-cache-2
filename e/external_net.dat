5000|$|Molecular diffusion, often simply called diffusion, is {{the thermal}} motion of all (liquid or gas) {{particles}} at temperatures above absolute zero. The rate {{of this movement}} {{is a function of}} temperature, viscosity of the fluid and the size (mass) of the particles. Diffusion explains the net flux of molecules from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration. Once the concentrations are equal the molecules continue to move, but since there is no concentration gradient the process of molecular diffusion has ceased and is instead governed by the process of self-diffusion, originating from the random motion of the molecules. The result of diffusion is a gradual mixing of material such that the distribution of molecules is uniform. Since the molecules are still in motion, but an equilibrium has been established, the end result of molecular diffusion is called a [...] "dynamic equilibrium". In a phase with uniform temperature, absent <b>external</b> <b>net</b> forces acting on the particles, the diffusion process will eventually result in complete mixing.|$|E

It utilizes an approach where <b>net</b> <b>external</b> debt holdings behave like a "shadow interest rate" in affecting the current account imbalances. This paper has four major findings. First, in a simple accounting framework, <b>net</b> <b>external</b> debt holdings have a significant dampening effect on medium-term current account imbalances - an increase in the <b>net</b> <b>external</b> debt holdings by 10 % of GDP improves medium-term current account balances by 1 % of GDP. Second, <b>net</b> <b>external</b> debt holdings affect current account imbalances through their effect on domestic investment and government expenditures.

Third, across the country groups, it is found that OECD countries differ from developing countries in current account adjustments as government expenditures deteriorate more in developing countries than in OECD countries across the sample period.

However, most of the supporting lab data was gathered with hydrostatic/isotropic external stresses, quite unrepresentative of in situ conditions. It is well known that the in situ stress vectors are quite anisotropic, with the maximum principal stress (usually horizontal tectonic) being as much as 50 % greater than the minimum principal stress (whether horizontal or vertical).

30|$|The {{appreciation}} of the Swiss franc {{since the start of}} the financial crisis has been a traumatic experience for Swiss-based investors, repeatedly turning their currency exposures into severe losses. The impact of this experience is hard to overestimate. Ten years later, broad anecdotal evidence and current account statistics suggest that the propensity of Swiss-based investors (and corporates) to assume currency risk has been durably reduced when not annihilated. With extremely low—in fact currently negative—risk-free interest rates in francs, this implies that prudent investors—notably pension funds—face a very high hurdle in order to deliver the investment returns that are counted on. Macroeconomically, the reluctance to take on currency risks has meant the end of the previously prevailing external balance of payment equilibrium whereby the current account surplus is compensated by equi-proportionate <b>external</b> <b>net</b> capital flows. As a consequence, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) has been forced into substituting public capital flows to the missing private ones and in so doing has accumulated a balance sheet exceeding 100 % of GDP as of this writing.|$|E

The development of foreign branches and subsidiaries has been influenced by two counterbalancing forces; the big banking groups reduced their presence abroad while some medium-sized banks opened their first branches; the focus of foreign branches and subsidiaries has been on specific segments of banking activities, very often exploiting "localization" advantages. Despite the improvement in the Nineties, Italian banks have tended to show a relatively low degree of internationalisation compared with the main European banking system.                  JEL Codes: G 21, F 23 Keywords: Bank, Banking</p...|$|E
