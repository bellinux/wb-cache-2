5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} dependence {{occurs in}} {{about one-third of}} individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which typically results in tolerance and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome {{in a matter of}} days. The risk factors for dependence include dependent personality, use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high potency and long-term use of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble a person’s underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and rebound effects. Tolerance and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor <b>down-regulation</b> and GABAA receptor alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.|$|E
5|$|Silencing systemin did {{not affect}} the ability of black {{nightshade}} to resist herbivory and, when competing against normal plants, silenced plants produced more above-ground biomass and berries. Upon herbivory, systemin was down-regulated in black nightshade in contrast to the other peptides which are up-regulated after herbivory. By contrast HypSys were up-regulated and activated the synthesis of protease inhibitors. The <b>down-regulation</b> of systemin was associated with increased root mass but did not decrease shoot mass, demonstrating that systemin can cause developmental changes as a result of herbivory, allowing the plant to tolerate, rather than directly resist attack. Tomato roots were also affected by tomato systemin, with root growth increasing at high tomato systemin concentrations. By allocating more resources to the roots, plants under attack are thought to store carbon and then use it to re-grow when the attack ends. Overexpressing AtPEP1 also increased root and shoot biomass in A. thaliana.|$|E
25|$|NEDD4 mediates ubiquitination and {{subsequent}} <b>down-regulation</b> of {{components of the}} epidermal growth factor (EGF) signalling pathway, such as HER3 and HER4 EGF receptors, and ACK.|$|E
25|$|The {{fibroblast}} {{growth factor}} receptor 1 (FGFR1) undergoes NEDD4 mediated ubiquitination and <b>down-regulation,</b> and interestingly contains a novel site (VL***PSR) that binds the C2 and WW3 domain of NEDD4.|$|E
25|$|GPCR {{regulation}} is additionally mediated by gene transcription factors. These factors can {{increase or decrease}} gene transcription and thus increase or decrease the generation of new receptors (up- or <b>down-regulation)</b> that travel to the cell membrane.|$|E
25|$|NEDD4 can bind and ubiquitinate the {{epithelial}} {{sodium channel}} (ENaC), leading to <b>down-regulation</b> of sodium channel activity. However, in vivo studies have implicated the NEDD4 family member NEDD4-2 {{as the main}} ligase responsible for ENaC regulation.|$|E
25|$|Narcolepsy: Lesions {{along the}} PPT/LDT nuclei are {{associated}} with narcolepsy. There is a significant <b>down-regulation</b> of PPN output {{and a loss of}} orexin peptides, promoting the excessive daytime sleepiness that is characteristic of this disorder.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{previous}} discussed reports Johnidis et al. (2005) {{have discovered that}} (at least some) genes within clusters are not co-regulated. Aire is a transcription factor which has an up- and <b>down-regulation</b> effect on various genes. It functions in negative selection of thymocytes, which responds to the organisms own epitopes, by medullary cells.|$|E
25|$|Recently, unique {{autoantibody}} {{patterns that}} distinguish RRMS, secondary progressive (SPMS), and primary progressive (PPMS) have been found, based on up- and <b>down-regulation</b> of CNS antigens, tested by microarrays. In particular, RRMS {{is characterized by}} autoantibodies to heat shock proteins that were not observed in PPMS or SPMS. These antibodies patterns {{can be used to}} monitor disease progression.|$|E
25|$|A {{new model}} has {{recently}} {{surfaced in the}} literature regarding the HPA axis (structures in the brain that get activated in response to stress) and its involvement with dysthymia (e.g. phenotypic variations of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), and <b>down-regulation</b> of adrenal functioning) as well as forebrain serotonergic mechanisms. Since this model is highly provisional, further research is still needed.|$|E
25|$|An {{experimental}} treatment, enzyme potentiated desensitization (EPD), {{has been}} tried for decades but is not generally accepted as effective. EPD uses dilutions of allergen and an enzyme, beta-glucuronidase, to which T-regulatory lymphocytes are supposed to respond by favoring desensitization, or <b>down-regulation,</b> rather than sensitization. EPD has also been tried {{for the treatment of}} autoimmune diseases but evidence does not show effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Several {{hypotheses}} {{are given}} about how tolerance develops, including opioid receptor phosphorylation (which {{would change the}} receptor conformation), functional decoupling of receptors from G-proteins (leading to receptor desensitization), μ-opioid receptor internalization or receptor <b>down-regulation</b> (reducing the number of available receptors for morphine to act on), and upregulation of the cAMP pathway (a counterregulatory mechanism to opioid effects) (For a review of these processes, see Koch and Hollt.) CCK might mediate some counter-regulatory pathways responsible for opioid tolerance. CCK-antagonist drugs, specifically proglumide, {{have been shown to}} slow the development of tolerance to morphine.|$|E
25|$|For the {{treatment}} of rheumatoid arthritis, inhibition of DHFR is not {{thought to be the}} main mechanism, but rather multiple mechanisms appear to be involved, including the inhibition of enzymes involved in purine metabolism, leading to accumulation of adenosine; inhibition of T cell activation and suppression of intercellular adhesion molecule expression by T cells; selective <b>down-regulation</b> of B cells; increasing CD95 sensitivity of activated T cells; and inhibition of methyltransferase activity, leading to deactivation of enzyme activity relevant to immune system function. Another mechanism of MTX is the inhibition of the binding of interleukin 1-beta to its cell surface receptor.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepine {{treatment}} {{should be}} discontinued {{as soon as}} possible by a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen. Tolerance develops to the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines; for example tolerance occurs to the anticonvulsant effects and as a result benzodiazepines are not generally recommended for the long-term management of epilepsy. Dose increases may overcome the effects of tolerance, but tolerance may then develop to the higher dose and adverse effects may increase. The mechanism of tolerance to benzodiazepines includes uncoupling of receptor sites, alterations in gene expression, <b>down-regulation</b> of receptor sites, and desensitisation of receptor sites to the effect of GABA. About one-third of individuals who take benzodiazepines for longer than four weeks become dependent and experience withdrawal syndrome on cessation.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} rate of omega-6 DGLA to AA largely determines {{the production of}} the prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2. Omega-3 EPA prevents AA from being released from membranes, thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from pro-inflammatory PGE2 (made from AA) toward anti-inflammatory PGE1 (made from DGLA). Moreover, the conversion (desaturation) of DGLA to AA is controlled by the enzyme delta-5-desaturase, which in turn is controlled by hormones such as insulin (up-regulation) and glucagon (<b>down-regulation).</b> The amount and type of carbohydrates consumed, along with some types of amino acid, can influence processes involving insulin, glucagon, and other hormones; therefore, the ratio of omega-3 versus omega-6 has wide effects on general health, and specific effects on immune function and inflammation, and mitosis (i.e., cell division).|$|E
25|$|In human cells, the ABO alleles {{and their}} encoded glycosyltransferases have been {{described}} in several oncologic conditions. Using anti-GTA/GTB monoclonal antibodies, it was demonstrated that a loss of these enzymes was correlated to malignant bladder and oral epithelia. Furthermore, the expression of ABO blood group antigens in normal human tissues is dependent the type of differentiation of the epithelium. In most human carcinomas, including oral carcinoma, a significant event {{as part of the}} underlying mechanism is decreased expression of the A and B antigens. Several studies have observed that a relative <b>down-regulation</b> of GTA and GTB occurs in oral carcinomas in association with tumor development. More recently, a genome wide association study (GWAS) has identified variants in the ABO locus associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer.|$|E
25|$|MiR-1 has {{key roles}} in the {{development}} and differentiation of smooth and skeletal muscles. For example, in the lineage-specific differention of smooth muscle cells from embroyonic stem cell derived cultures, MiR-1 is required; as its loss of function resulted in a reduction in smooth muscle cell biomarkers and a reduction in the derived smooth muscle cell population. There is evidence that the control of smooth muscle cell differentiation by MiR-1 may be mediated by the down regulation of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), since a MiR-1 recognition site is predicted in the 3' UTR of KLF4 and inhibition of MiR-1 results in reversed <b>down-regulation</b> of KLF4 and an inhibition of smooth muscle cell differentiation. A mutation in the 3' UTR of the myostatin gene in Texel sheep creates a miR-1 and miR-206 target site. This is likely to cause the muscular phenotype of this breed of sheep.|$|E
25|$|HMGA2 protein {{specifically}} targets the {{promoter of}} ERCC1, thus reducing expression of this DNA repair gene. ERCC1 protein expression was deficient in 100% of 47 evaluated colon cancers (though {{the extent to}} which HGMA2 was involved is not known). A 2012 study showed that in normal tissues, HGMA1 and HMGA2 genes are targeted (and thus strongly reduced in expression) by miR-15, miR-16, miR-26a, miR-196a2 and Let-7a. However, each of these HMGA-targeting miRNAs are drastically reduced in almost all human pituitary adenomas studied, when compared with the normal pituitary gland. Consistent with the <b>down-regulation</b> of these HMGA-targeting miRNAs, an increase in the HMGA1 and HMGA2-specific mRNAs was observed. Three of these microRNAs (miR-16, miR-196a and Let-7a) have methylated promoters and therefore low expression in colon cancer. For two of these, miR-15 and miR-16, the coding regions are epigenetically silenced in cancer due to histone deacetylase activity. When these microRNAs are expressed at a low level, then HMGA1 and HMGA2 proteins are expressed at a high level. HMGA1 and HMGA2 target (reduce expression of) BRCA1 and ERCC1 DNA repair genes. Thus DNA repair can be reduced, likely contributing to cancer progression.|$|E
500|$|In epilepsy, the {{resistance}} of excitatory neurons to fire during this period is decreased. This may occur due to changes in ion channels or inhibitory neurons not functioning properly. This then results in a specific area from which seizures may develop, known as a [...] "seizure focus". Another mechanism of epilepsy may be the up-regulation of excitatory circuits or <b>down-regulation</b> of inhibitory circuits following an injury to the brain. These secondary epilepsies occur through processes known as epileptogenesis. Failure of the blood–brain barrier {{may also be a}} causal mechanism as it would allow substances in the blood to enter the brain.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{link between}} miRNA {{and the growth}} of cancer was {{reported}} in 2002 when researchers observed a <b>down-regulation</b> of miR-15a and miR-16-1 in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. The term is a portmanteau, derived from [...] "oncogenic" [...] + [...] "miRNA", coined by Scott M. Hammond in a 2006 paper characterizing OncomiR-1.|$|E
2500|$|An {{optional}} signal sensing domain (SSD) (e.g., a {{ligand binding}} domain), which senses external signals and, in response, transmits these {{signals to the}} rest of the transcription complex, resulting in up- or <b>down-regulation</b> of gene expression. [...] Also, the DBD and signal-sensing domains may reside on separate proteins that associate within the transcription complex to regulate gene expression.|$|E
2500|$|Cyclic {{nucleotides}} {{are integral}} to a communication system that acts within cells. [...] They act as [...] "second messengers" [...] by relaying the signals of many first messengers, such as hormones and neurotransmitters, to their physiological destinations. Cyclic nucleotides participate in many physiological responses, including receptor-effector coupling, <b>down-regulation</b> of drug responsiveness, protein-kinase cascades, and transmembrane signal transduction.|$|E
2500|$|When {{potentiation}} is {{sustained by}} long-term use, neuroadaptations occur which result in decreased GABAergic response. What is {{certain is that}} surface GABAA receptor protein levels are altered in response to benzodiazepine exposure, as is receptor turnover rate. [...] The exact reason for the reduced responsiveness has not been elucidated but <b>down-regulation</b> {{of the number of}} receptors has only been observed at some receptor locations including in the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra; <b>down-regulation</b> of the number of receptors or internalization {{does not appear to be}} the main mechanism at other locations. Evidence exists for other hypotheses including changes in the receptor conformation, changes in turnover, recycling, or production rates, degree of phosphorylation and receptor gene expression, subunit composition, decreased coupling mechanisms between the GABA and benzodiazepine site, decrease in GABA production, and compensatory increased gutamatergic activity. [...] A unified model hypothesis involves a combination of internalization of the receptor, followed by preferential degradation of certain receptor sub-units, which provides the nuclear activation for changes in receptor gene transcription.|$|E

2500|$|Aberrant {{promoter}} hypermethylation of SFRP1 occurs frequently {{during the}} pathogenesis of human cancers and {{has been found to}} be one of the primary mechanisms in SFRP1 <b>down-regulation.</b> [...] Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) is able to detect this epigenetic change and could be used for cancer detection. [...] Detection and quantification of promoter CpG methylation in body fluid is both feasible and noninvasive. Combined MSP analyses of multiple genes in voided urine could provide a reliable way to improve cancer diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|Nuclear receptors {{have the}} ability to {{directly}} bind to DNA and regulate the expression of adjacent genes, hence these receptors are classified as transcription factors. [...] The regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptors generally only happens when a ligand — a molecule that affects the receptor's behavior — is present. [...] More specifically, ligand binding to a nuclear receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor, which, in turn, activates the receptor, resulting in up- or <b>down-regulation</b> of gene expression.|$|E
2500|$|Transfection of miR-155 {{into human}} primary lung {{fibroblasts}} reduces the endogenous {{expression of the}} angiotensin II receptor AT1R protein. Furthermore, AT1R mediates angiotensin II-related elevation in blood pressure and contributes to the pathogenesis of heart failure. Defective miR-155 function could be implicated in hypertension and cardiovascular diseases if the cis-regulatory site on 3` UTR of AT1R (miR-155 target site) was affected due to a SNP polymorphism in AT1R itself. This mutation is disruptive of [...] miR-155 targeting and thus preventive of AT1R expression <b>down-regulation.</b> In low blood pressure over-expression of miR-155 correlates with the impairment of AT1R activity.|$|E
2500|$|Small {{lipophilic}} substances such {{as natural}} hormones diffuse through the cell membrane and bind to nuclear receptors {{located in the}} cytosol (type I NR) or nucleus (type II NR) of the cell. [...] Binding causes a conformational change in the receptor which, depending on the class of receptor, triggers a cascade of downstream events that direct the NRs to DNA transcription regulation sites which result in up or <b>down-regulation</b> of gene expression. They generally function as homo/heterodimers. [...] In addition, two additional classes, type III which are a variant of type I, and type IV that bind DNA as monomers have also been identified.|$|E
2500|$|The somatic {{mutation}} theory of metastasis development {{has not been}} substantiated in human cancers. [...] Rather, {{it seems that the}} genetic state of the primary tumor reflects the ability of that cancer to metastasize. [...] Research comparing gene expression between primary and metastatic adenocarcinomas identified a subset of genes whose expression could distinguish primary tumors from metastatic tumors, dubbed a [...] "metastatic signature." [...] Up-regulated genes in the signature include: [...] SNRPF, HNRPAB, DHPS and securin. [...] Actin, myosin and MHC class II <b>down-regulation</b> was also associated with the signature. [...] Additionally, the metastatic-associated expression of these genes was also observed in some primary tumors, indicating that cells with the potential to metastasize could be identified concurrently with diagnosis of the primary tumor.|$|E
2500|$|As Epac2 is {{involved}} in many physiological functions in various cells, defects in the Epac2/Rap1 signaling mechanism could {{contribute to the development}} of various pathological states. [...] Studies of Epac2 knockout mice indicate that Epac-mediated signaling is required for potentiation of insulin secretion by incretins (gut hormones released from enteroendocrine cells following meal ingestion) such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, suggesting that Epac2 is a promising target for treatment of diabetes. In fact, incretin-based diabetes therapies are currently used in clinical practice worldwide; development of Epac2-selective agonists might well lead to the discovery of further novel anti-diabetic drugs. An analog of GLP-1 has been shown to exert a blood pressure-lowering effect by stimulation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion through Epac2. In heart, chronic stimulation of β-adrenergic receptor is known to progress to arrhythmia through an Epac2-dependent mechanism. In brain, up-regulation of Epac1 and <b>down-regulation</b> of Epac2 mRNA are observed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting roles of Epacs in the disease. An Epac2 rare coding variant is found in patients with autism and could be responsible for the dendritic morphological abnormalities.|$|E
