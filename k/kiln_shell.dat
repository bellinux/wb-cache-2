5000|$|Tyres, {{sometimes}} called riding rings, usually {{consist of a}} single annular steel casting, machined to a smooth cylindrical surface, which attach loosely to the <b>kiln</b> <b>shell</b> {{through a variety of}} [...] "chair" [...] arrangements. These require some ingenuity of design, since the tyre must fit the shell snugly, but also allow thermal movement. The tyre rides on pairs of steel rollers, also machined to a smooth cylindrical surface, and set about half a kiln-diameter apart. The rollers must support the kiln, and allow rotation that is as nearly frictionless as possible. A well-engineered kiln, when the power is cut off, will swing pendulum-like many times before coming to rest. The mass of a typical 6 x 60 m kiln, including refractories and feed, is around 1100 tonnes, and would be carried on three tyres and sets of rollers, spaced {{along the length of the}} kiln. The longest kilns may have 8 sets of rollers, while very short kilns may have only two. Kilns usually rotate at 0.5 to 2 rpm, but sometimes as fast as 5 rpm. The Kilns of most modern cement plants are running at 4 to 5 rpm. The bearings of the rollers must be capable of withstanding the large static and live loads involved, and must be carefully protected from the heat of the kiln and the ingress of dust. In addition to support rollers, there are usually upper and lower [...] "retaining (or thrust) rollers" [...] bearing against the side of tyres, that prevent the kiln from slipping off the support rollers. Now rotary kiln length is 84 meters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{crack of}} <b>kiln</b> <b>shells</b> was seen {{regularly}} due to axis deflection and asymmetric load distribution. It {{will be helpful}} to improve kiln performance if the remaining life of <b>kiln</b> <b>shells</b> can be kept the same. For this the formulae of stress spectrum and fatigue life of <b>kiln</b> <b>shells</b> are obtained. Taking the aligned values of axis deflections as design variables, equal fatigue life of shells and maximum axis deflection as the objective function, considering the fuzzy factors during axis alignment, the fuzzy optimization model of kiln axis alignment is set up. The results indicate that kiln axis can be aligned as direct as possible, and life expectancy of <b>kiln</b> <b>shells</b> can be optimized to keep near the same. Accordingly, the valuable production time of kiln can be increased greatly by such aligned method...|$|R

30|$|Lime {{has been}} used as a {{building}} and decoration material for thousands of years in China [8, 9]. However quick lime was in most cases slaked wet, only in coastal region, quick lime <b>kilned</b> from oyster <b>shells</b> was slaked dry, but without any grinding. This may be one of the reasons why the term “hydraulic lime” was translated into China as early as 1950 ′s, but not understandable and applied by most technicians.|$|R

The tires are weakly {{attached}} to the <b>kiln</b> <b>shell.</b> The rotation of the latter is made of three pairs of steel rollers. These rollers must support the oven and allow the rotation to be done, also as possible frictionless.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the process taken for the computational analysis of convective heat transfer from multiple large jets impinging {{on a large}} cylinder, and a one-dimensional model of chemistry and heat transfer within a rotary cement kiln. A correlation describing the forced convection effect of these jets was determined and was integrated into the one-dimensional model to represent the effect of large <b>kiln</b> <b>shell</b> cooling fans impinging on the shell of a rotary cement kiln. Formulations from previously developed one-dimensional models were combined together to form the model outlined in this thesis. Modifications {{were made to the}} chemistry formulation, thermal resistance through the kiln, and the inclusion of the effects of forced convection on the <b>kiln</b> <b>shell.</b> It was concluded that the correlation developed was accurate within an interval of ± 26 %, while the one-dimensional model represented temperature profiles and species mass fractions reasonably well. Furthermore, the inclusion of forced convection in the kiln resistance model resulted in a decrease in shell temperature when compared to the case of only free convection...|$|E
40|$|Rotary kilns {{fired by}} coal or gas burners {{are widely used}} to process mineral sands to extract pure minerals, most {{commonly}} titanium dioxide, (TiO 2), in Western Australia. The kilns vary in size depending on refinery throughput, however most are very large items up to 70 metres long and 6 meters in diameter. The kilns are constructed from carbon manganese structural and pressure vessel plates and welded {{in the same manner}} a s large pressure vessels, however structural welding standards are applied. The mineral sands are purified using a pyrometallurgical process where the internal operating temperature reaches approximately 1200 °C. These temperatures are outside the operational limits of carbon manganese steel, so a protective internal layer of refractory approximately 250 mm thick is required to reduce the shell temperature to between 100 °C and 200 °C. The refractory is poured in strips along the bottom of the kiln incorporating refractory anchors to stabilise the refractory upon drying. The refractory anchors are 253 MA stainless steel, secured to the <b>kiln</b> <b>shell</b> via a welded lug incorporating a slot. This design is referred to as a “rotor lok” assembly. Failure of the welded lug is relatively common during service, requiring costly kiln shutdown for remedial work and casting new refractory. The failures are mainly contributable to stress concentrations present at the fillet weld toes, with fatigue the failure mechanism in all cases. When failures arise, movement of the refractory lining over time causes a loss of lining where irreversible damage to the <b>kiln</b> <b>shell</b> occurs. This dissertation researches and discusses alternative methods for securing the 253 MA stainless steel refractory anchor to the <b>kiln</b> <b>shell</b> to provide a higher level of serviceability and reliability to prevent costly unexpected refinery shutdown. Over time, total replacement of the refractory is necessary, and renewing the anchor attachments using current methods is time consuming and expensive without consideration to lost production revenue. Stud welding is proposed as a realistic option for the application of securing the refractory anchor. The author has attempted to persuade operators of rotary kilns that this option is viable, by applying mechanical testing regimes to selected studs which show the stud welded option out performs the welded lug in all testing applied...|$|E
