5|$|The bronze nails, {{with their}} flat tops and raised edges which prevent coins from {{tumbling}} onto the pavement, were made as convenient tables at which merchants could {{carry out their}} business. The oldest pillar is undated, but <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> it is late Elizabethan. The second oldest was given by Bristol merchant Robert Kitchen, who died in 1594. The two remaining nails are dated 1625 and 1631.|$|E
5|$|Food {{politics}} in Africa {{differs from the}} cases in North America and Europe in {{that there is a}} case of small scale food power in Africa, particularly in Sudan. Some <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> that the cases of famine and food insecurity in Africa are due to inconsistent output of food production and the downward spiral of the interaction between population growth and environmental sustainability. But upon closer inspection, it is revealed that nature is not the only catalyst for Africa’s numerous food insecurity issues.|$|E
5|$|Although {{more common}} since 1995, few above-normal {{hurricane}} seasons occurred during 1970–94. Destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926 to 1960, including many major New England hurricanes. Twenty-one Atlantic tropical storms formed in 1933, a record only recently exceeded in 2005, which saw 28 storms. Tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of 1900–25; however, many intense storms formed during 1870–99. During the 1887 season, 19 tropical storms formed, {{of which a}} record 4 occurred after November 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes. Few hurricanes occurred in the 1840s to 1860s; however, many struck in the early 19th century, including an 1821 storm that made a direct hit on New York City. Some historical weather <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> these storms may have been as high as Category 4 in strength.|$|E

25|$|Polls have {{suggested}} that the economy is the major issue going into this election, especially with the resulting high price of gas, along with rising prices of other goods and services, such as food, and the possible impact the current financial crisis may have on Canada.

25|$|<b>Experts</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} {{migration}} of both Bengalis and Burmese (Rohingya) to Pakistan started in the 1980s and continued till 1998.

25|$|Another {{technical}} {{problem facing}} {{the project is}} that the current runway is at an elevation of only four metres above the mean sea level. An extension of the runway into the sea would mean having {{to account for the}} sea level during high tide. <b>Experts</b> <b>say</b> the elevation of the main runway to about 12 metres above sea level would require the elevation of the entire airport, leading to flooding in the neighbourhood in the monsoons.|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{comparisons}} between HFCS and table sugar, {{there is some}} evidence that the overconsumption of added sugar in any form, including HFCS, is a major health problem, especially for onset of obesity. Consuming added sugars, particularly as sweetened soft drinks, is strongly linked to weight gain. The World Health Organization has recommended that people limit their consumption of added sugars to 10% of calories, but <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> that typical consumption of empty calories in the United States is nearly twice that level.|$|E

50|$|In May 2015, Orexigen ended {{a safety}} study of its diet drug earlier than planned, because an {{independent}} panel of <b>experts</b> <b>says</b> the drug maker “inappropriately” compromised the trial by prematurely releasing interim data.

25|$|Educational <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> {{the rise}} in use of private schools in the 2000s {{is partly due to}} white Danish {{families}} putting their children in private schools when the neighbouring public school gets more than 30% pupils of immigrant background. About 24% of pupils grade 1-3 in Copenhagen attend private schools. Another factor is parents in small communities who have organized to start a private school when small public schools have closed as a results of the Danish municipality reform which led to fewer municipalities.|$|E
25|$|In March 2007, a {{suspected}} outbreak occurred in Galway, Ireland, after {{the source of}} water {{for much of the}} county, Lough Corrib, was suspected to be contaminated with the parasite. A large population (90,000 people), including areas of both Galway City and County, were advised to boil water for drinking, food preparation and for brushing teeth. On 21 March 2007, it was confirmed that the city and county's water supply was contaminated with the parasite. The area's water supply was finally given approval on 20 August 2007, five months after Cryptosporidium was first detected. Around 240 people are known to have contracted the disease; <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> the true figure could be up to 5,000.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2009 it was {{reported}} that US Airways, along with American Airlines and United Airlines was placed under credit watch. <b>Experts</b> <b>say</b> several factors, including capital and revenue, {{played a role in the}} airline's addition to the list. On October 2, US Airways reported that it had a buyer for 10 of its 25 Embraer 190 Aircraft. The remaining 15 aircraft were scheduled to be redeployed to Boston where they would operate Boston to Philadelphia and the Boston to New York LaGuardia leg of the US Airways Shuttle service.

25|$|Bangladesh is {{a unitary}} state and {{parliamentary}} democracy. Bangladesh also {{stands out as}} one of the few Muslim-majority democracies. “It is a moderate and generally secular and tolerant — though sometimes this is getting stretched at the moment — alternative to violent extremism in a very troubled part of the world”, said Dan Mozena, the U.S. ambassador to Bangladesh. Although Bangladesh's legal code is secular, more citizens are embracing a conservative version of Islam, with some pushing for sharia law, analysts say. <b>Experts</b> <b>say</b> that the rise in conservatism reflects the influence of foreign-financed Islamic charities and the more austere version of Islam brought home by migrant workers in Persian Gulf countries.|$|E
25|$|From time to time, new {{vulnerabilities}} {{are discovered}} in various versions of Adobe Reader, prompting {{the company to}} issue security fixes. Other PDF readers are also susceptible. One aggravating factor is that a PDF reader can be configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file, providing a vector for attack. If a malicious web page contains an infected PDF file that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the PDF reader, the system may be compromised even if the browser is secure. Some of these vulnerabilities {{are a result of}} the PDF standard allowing PDF documents to be scripted with JavaScript. Disabling JavaScript execution in the PDF reader can help mitigate such future exploits, although it does not protect against exploits {{in other parts of the}} PDF viewing software. Security <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> that JavaScript is not essential for a PDF reader, and that the security benefit that comes from disabling JavaScript outweighs any compatibility issues caused. One way of avoiding PDF file exploits is to have a local or web service convert files to another format before viewing.|$|E
