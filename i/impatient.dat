5|$|Barnes {{needed a}} score to {{rehabilitate}} {{himself in the}} eyes of the Test Selectors and he spent all Saturday over 131runs while 20,000 <b>impatient</b> spectators barracked loudly. His dismissal on the third day evoked cheers all round the ground.|$|E
5|$|By early 1799, the French Directory {{had become}} <b>impatient</b> with {{stalling}} tactics employed by Austria. The uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested {{the timing was}} fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany.|$|E
5|$|On 15 November 1995, Martin {{announced}} he would appeal the sentence. He later dropped the appeal without giving an explanation on 4January 1996, four days before {{it was to have}} been heard. He turned down a subsequent chance to petition the President of Singapore for clemency, saying that he was <b>impatient</b> to be executed.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtship}} between Ferdinand and Miranda {{is one of}} {{the chief}} beauties of this play. It is the very purity of love. The pretended interference of Prospero with it heightens its interest, and is in character with the magician, whose sense of preternatural power makes him arbitrary, tetchy, and <b>impatient</b> of opposition.|$|E
5|$|Accounts by 19th-century historians {{suggest that}} Day grew <b>impatient</b> {{with the girls}} when they became bored with their lessons and began to squabble, and that he also spent {{significant}} time nursing them through a bout of smallpox. These accounts may have been exaggerated as both girls had been inoculated against smallpox, and their strict upbringing meant {{they would not have}} rebelled excessively.|$|E
5|$|As {{it turned}} out, {{there were no}} Indians, but only a single British officer, John Money of the 9th regiment, Burgoyne's deputy quartermaster. He had been leading a group of Indians, but when they seemed {{reluctant}} to fight the Americans, Money became <b>impatient</b> and ran ahead of them; it was his war cries that brought {{an end to the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|Building on {{his results}} on matrix games {{and on his}} model of an {{expanding}} economy, von Neumann invented the theory of duality in linear programming, after George Dantzig described his work in a few minutes, when an <b>impatient</b> von Neumann asked him {{to get to the}} point. Then, Dantzig listened dumbfounded while von Neumann provided an hour lecture on convex sets, fixed-point theory, and duality, conjecturing the equivalence between matrix games and linear programming.|$|E
5|$|David Jenkins, who was {{a student}} and {{assistant}} to Parry at Aberystwyth, described him as impulsive and unable to criticise his own works, too erratic {{to be a good}} conductor and too <b>impatient</b> for all but advanced students, but with a boyish enthusiasm, especially for music. Sir Alexander Mackenzie, who also worked with Parry, also noted his great enthusiasm and described him as a man of great musical ability.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the {{sluggish}} response of Brazil, infuriated by the {{mockery of the}} Buenos Aires press and <b>impatient</b> at Argentina's refusal to permit him to invade a further Brazilian province through sovereign Argentine territory, on 13 April 1865 López fired upon and seized two small Argentine naval vessels moored in the port of Corrientes, then proceeded to take the Argentine province of that name, making Paraguayan paper currency compulsory on pain of death. The resulting War of the Triple Alliance was to destroy his country.|$|E
5|$|Ian Garrad, <b>impatient</b> to {{establish}} whether the conversion was feasible, commissioned racing driver and fabricator Ken Miles to build another prototype {{as quickly as}} he could. Miles was provided with a budget of $800, a Series II Alpine, a Ford V8 engine and a 2-speed automatic transmission, and in about a week he had a running V8 conversion, thus proving the concept.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, when Horatio was 14 and due {{to leave}} the orphanage, he ran away without waiting for the formalities. His aunt Caroline Praill—his mother's sister—who lived in nearby Edgbaston, gave him a home, while he worked as an errand boy in a Birmingham {{building}} firm. This arrangement lasted {{only a few months}} before Horatio, <b>impatient</b> to be reunited with his sister from whom he had been separated for six years, went to London where he began an apprenticeship with a wood engraver.|$|E
5|$|Skírnir rides home. Standing outside, Freyr {{immediately}} greets Skírnir {{and asks}} for news. Skírnir tells him that Gerðr says she will meet with him at Barri. Freyr, <b>impatient,</b> comments that one night is long, as is two nights, and questions how he will bear three, noting that frequently a month seemed shorter than half a night before being with Gerðr.|$|E
5|$|The {{book has}} been called engagingly written, wisely researched, and {{honestly}} told. Critics admired the wit and humour. The book reviewer for The Globe and Mail admitted he grew <b>impatient</b> with the grand and repetitive statements about the changing global food system and the authors' hyperbole regarding their modest culinary discoveries. Compared to Kingsolver's Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, The 100-Mile Diet {{was found to be}} more compelling and easier to read, with Smith and MacKinnon more relatable and sympathetic than Kingsolver.|$|E
5|$|After Operation Save, the {{division}} remained relatively static {{for more than}} three weeks, mopping up and repelling local Partisan attacks. The Muslims were <b>impatient</b> to push further into Bosnia, but the reconnaissance battalion was heavily engaged on {{the division}}al western flank, attacking positions held by the Partisan 3rd Vojvodina Brigade of the 36th Vojvodina Division at Gornji Rahić on 26 March, killing 124 Partisans and capturing 14. The battalion captured several more Partisan positions in the following week. In early April, 200 Partisans of the 16th Muslim Brigade surrendered to the division. They were mostly former members of various Muslim militias who had been conscripted into the ranks of the Partisans.|$|E
5|$|After {{considering}} {{pursuing a}} master's degree {{on the topic}} of hard science fiction novels as fascist literature, Gibson discontinued writing in the year that followed graduation and, as one critic put it, expanded his collection of punk records. During this period he worked at various jobs, including a three-year stint as teaching assistant on a film history course at his alma mater. <b>Impatient</b> at much of what he saw at a science fiction convention in Vancouver in 1980 or 1981, Gibson found a kindred spirit in fellow panelist, punk musician and author John Shirley. The two became immediate and lifelong friends. Shirley persuaded Gibson to sell his early short stories and to take writing seriously.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Sheridan {{pressured}} {{his officers}} to pursue Early's retreating army. On September 23, Sheridan became <b>impatient</b> with the cautious {{commander of the}} 2nd Cavalry Division, General Averell. Sheridan replaced Averell with Colonel Powell, who {{had been one of}} Averell's brigade commanders. Powell was promoted to brigadier general shortly afterwards. Colonel Henry Capehart was designated commander of Powell's old brigade, and Capehart's brother, Charles, became commander of Capehart's 1st West Virginia Cavalry regiment. Major Hoffman remained commander of the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry regiment. Powell's 2nd Cavalry Division pursued Early further south. During this pursuit, Confederate cavalry led by General Williams Carter Wickham attempted a flanking maneuver on Powell's right, but was repulsed by artillery and a charge by the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry.|$|E
5|$|As a leader, Patton {{was known}} to be highly critical, {{correcting}} subordinates mercilessly for the slightest infractions, but also being quick to praise their accomplishments. Although he garnered a reputation as a general who was both <b>impatient</b> and impulsive and had little tolerance for officers who had failed to succeed, he fired only one general during World War II, Orlando Ward, and only after two warnings, whereas Bradley sacked several generals during the war. Patton reportedly had the utmost respect for the men serving in his command, particularly the wounded. Many of his directives showed special trouble to care for the enlisted men under his command, and he was well known for arranging extra supplies for battlefield soldiers, including blankets and extra socks, galoshes, and other items normally in short supply at the front.|$|E
5|$|As {{the months}} passed, and the privations in Constantinople increased, the pro-Kantakouzenos faction {{in the capital}} grew as the Empress refused even to {{consider}} negotiations. Twice agents were sent to assassinate Kantakouzenos, but they failed. The Empress eventually fell out with Patriarch John Kalekas, who was deposed in a synod on 2 February 1347. On the same night, supporters of Kantakouzenos opened the disused Golden Gate, and Kantakouzenos entered the city with 1,000 men. Meeting no resistance, his troops surrounded the Palace of Blachernae, the imperial residence, the next morning, but the Empress refused to surrender for several days, still fearful of the fate that awaited her. Kantakouzenos' men grew <b>impatient</b> and stormed part of the palace complex, and John V persuaded his mother to accept a settlement.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, Sands {{had become}} <b>impatient</b> with the Navy's bureaucracy. After {{discussing}} {{the situation with}} Wilson, he appeared unannounced in Santa Fe, New Mexico, {{at the office of}} Dorothy McKibbin, who had been designated to meet newcomers to Los Alamos Laboratory. After she made a telephone call to the personnel office, which had just received a desperate call for electronics people, Sands was bussed to Los Alamos. To his surprise, he was met by Jorgenson, who had just joined the Manhattan Project after leaving Clark and going to Nebraska. He immediately took Sands to the library to read Robert Serber's Los Alamos Primer, which introduced him to the basic physical principles of nuclear fission as they were known at the time, and their implications for nuclear weapon design.|$|E
5|$|By September 1945, many of {{the self-proclaimed}} pemuda, who were ready to die for '100% freedom', were getting <b>impatient.</b> It was common for ethnic 'out-groups' – Dutch internees, Eurasian, Ambonese and Chinese – and anyone {{considered}} to be a spy, to be subjected to intimidation, kidnap, robbery, murder and organised massacres. Such attacks would continue throughout the course of the revolution, but were most present during the 1945-46 period, which is known as the Bersiap. p.78; Anthony Reid, Indonesian National Revolution (Hawthorn, Vic.: Longman, 1974), chs. 2 and 3; Shirley Fenton-Huie, The Forgotten Ones: Women and Children Under Nippon (Sydney: Angus and Robertson, 1992); Anthony Reid, 'Indonesia: revolution without socialism', in Robin Jeffrey (ed.), Asia: the Winning of Independence (London: MacMillan, 1981), pp. 107–57.|$|E
5|$|<b>Impatient</b> {{with nothing}} to do {{following}} his retirement, for about {{four and a half years}} from 1981 Choor Singh acted as a personal consultant for Tan Chin Tuan, the Chairman of the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), and other companies in the OCBC group such as Great Eastern Life and Overseas Assurance Corporation. For many years, Singh was chairman of both the Probation Committee which supervises the work of probation officers, and the Detention Board, and vice-president of the National Kidney Foundation Singapore. He was also a member of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights and the Disciplinary Committee for advocates and solicitors.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln, {{as well as}} {{many other}} leaders and {{citizens}} of the northern states, became increasingly <b>impatient</b> with McClellan's slowness to attack the Confederate forces still massed near Washington. The Union defeat at the minor Battle of Ball's Bluff near Leesburg in October added to the frustration and indirectly damaged McClellan. In December, the Congress formed a Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, which became a thorn in the side of many generals throughout the war, accusing them of incompetence and, in some cases, treason. McClellan was called as the first witness on December 23, but he contracted typhoid fever and could not attend. Instead, his subordinate officers testified, and their candid admissions that they had no knowledge of specific strategies for advancing against the Confederates raised many calls for McClellan's dismissal.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Gelimer {{remained}} blockaded by Pharas at {{the mountain}} stronghold of Medeus, {{but as the}} blockade dragged through the winter, Pharas grew <b>impatient.</b> He attacked the mountain stronghold, only to be beaten back {{with the loss of}} a quarter of his men. While a success for Gelimer, it did not alter his hopeless situation as he and his followers remained tightly blockaded and began to suffer from lack of food. Pharas sent him messages calling upon him to surrender and spare his followers the misery, {{but it was not until}} March that the Vandal king agreed to surrender after receiving guarantees for his safety. Gelimer was then escorted to Carthage.|$|E
5|$|Narayan {{performed}} in Afghanistan in 1952 and in China in 1954 and was well received in both countries. His first solo concert at a 1954 music festival in the Cowasji Jehangir Hall, Mumbai, {{was cut short}} when an <b>impatient</b> audience, waiting for performances by famous artists, drove him from the stage. Narayan pondered giving up the sarangi and becoming a singer. He later regained confidence, performed solo for smaller crowds, and was favourably received in his second attempt to play solo for a Mumbai music festival in 1956. He has since performed at the major music festivals of India. Narayan later gave up accompaniment; this decision carried a financial risk because interest in solo sarangi was not yet substantial.|$|E
5|$|On March 16, 1824 Mr. Lowndes, the BFBS's {{secretary}} in Corfu, {{sent a letter}} to the society in which he mentioned that the sum paid to Meksi for his work was 6,000 piastras and that Archimandrite Grigor was paid 60 crowns. On September 5, 1824 the Saint Matthew's Gospel was published in Albanian. According to Lowndes' letters, the Albanian community of Missolonghi was extremely excited when mass was said with a piece from Saint Matthew, as since its translation they had been <b>impatient</b> to hear it in Albanian. In July 1827 the form in which the first 500copies of the New Testament were to be bound was decided in London. The entire edition amounted to 2,000copies.|$|E
5|$|Satti (Sunil), Addala household's dutiful servant {{wakes up}} Siddhu in the morning. In the background, Siddhu's mother, Lakshmi (Jayasudha), is seen singing a devotional Telugu song while cooking. At the dining table, Aravind, Managing Director of their {{construction}} company, asks if Siddhu will join their office. When Siddhu deliberates, his father becomes <b>impatient</b> {{and plans for}} his marriage despite Siddhu's silent protest. The next week, Siddhu returns home {{to realize that he}} is going to get engaged to Subbulakshmi (Neha) against his wishes. He speaks with her only to realize that she is a daddy's girl (Tanikella Bharani being the father) and does not take a liking to her. However, with Aravind's final say, they eventually get engaged.|$|E
5|$|Some of the translators {{hired to}} work on the books were {{well-known}} authors before their work on Harry Potter, such as Viktor Golyshev, who oversaw the Russian translation of the series' fifth book. The Turkish translation of books two to seven was undertaken by Sevin Okyay, a popular literary critic and cultural commentator. For reasons of secrecy, translation on a given book could only start after it had been released in English, leading to a lag of several months before the translations were available. This led to more and more copies of the English editions being sold to <b>impatient</b> fans in non-English speaking countries; for example, such was the clamour to read the fifth book that its English language edition became the first English-language book ever to top the best-seller list in France.|$|E
5|$|The Australians had {{continued}} to operate independently within Phuoc Tuy province, and while the war had become a series of big unit search and destroy operations in a war of attrition for the Americans, they had pursued their own counter-insurgency campaign. Regardless, differences of opinion between Australian and American methods had produced friction, and increasingly <b>impatient</b> with the Australian approach, in early 1967 the Commander US MACV, General William Westmoreland, had complained to the Commander Australian Forces Vietnam, Major General Tim Vincent, demanding a more aggressive approach. However, the Australians were convinced that deliberate patrolling techniques were more effective in separating communist forces from {{the population in the}} villages while working towards slowly extending government control, and such urgings went largely unheeded.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations {{had tried}} {{several times to}} {{reconcile}} {{the government of the}} Congo with the State of Katanga, which had declared independence under Moïse Tshombe with Belgian support in 1960. Though initially limiting its actions, the United Nations Operation in the Congo became increasingly <b>impatient</b> towards Katanga and Tshombe and drew up plans to resolve the situation through force. Tshombe continuously violated agreements he had made with the United Nations and the Congolese government by building up his forces and bringing foreign mercenaries into the conflict. The situation came to a breaking point in December 1962 when Katangese gendarmes attacked peacekeeping forces in Katanga. United Nations Secretary-General U Thant authorised a retaliatory offensive to eliminate secessionist opposition.|$|E
5|$|Though Ziegfeld {{anticipated}} {{opening his}} new theatre on Sixth Avenue with Show Boat, the epic {{nature of the}} work required an unusually long gestation period and extensive changes during out-of-town tryouts. <b>Impatient</b> with Kern and Hammerstein and worried about the serious tone of the musical (he strongly disliked the songs Ol' Man River and Mis'ry's Comin' Around), Ziegfeld decided to open his theatre in February 1927 with Rio Rita, a musical by Kern's collaborator Guy Bolton. When Rio Rita proved to be a success, Show Boats Broadway opening was delayed until Rita could be moved to another theatre.|$|E
5|$|When Ip {{refuses to}} return to the arena, Miura grows <b>impatient</b> and sends the sadistic Colonel Sato along with several {{soldiers}} to find him. Sato sees Ip's wife and moves towards her. Ip defends his wife and incapacitates the three soldiers. They flee their apartment and take a room with Li Zhao's family. When the bandits return to the cotton mill, the workers fight back using the techniques that Ip taught them. Ip himself arrives midway through the battle. He defeats many of the robbers and personally beats Jin Shanzhao, embarrassing him, and warns him never to harass the workers again.|$|E
5|$|Yogesh is <b>impatient,</b> but Devu {{keeps the}} bride a secret. When she enters, Yogesh cannot tell who she is. When the {{ceremony}} ends, Devu welcomes {{the father of}} the bride: Sanjana's father. Yogesh is stunned when his grandfather brings the money to pay Jitu's debts. He asks Devu how he arranged the marriage; Devu explains that when Sanjana followed him and showed him a picture of her boyfriend, he remembered seeing the boyfriend kissing another woman in Khandala. He brought Sanjana to a hotel in Khandala to confront her boyfriend. Sanjana told him she would marry Yogesh, having realised that she loves him. The film ends with the marriage attendants asking Sanjana's astrological sign. Sanjana asks Yogesh what her raashee is, to which he says he does not know, and smiles.|$|E
5|$|Baker created four {{distinct}} {{stages of}} makeup design so that West {{would appear to}} melt gradually as time passed. However, after the film went through two separate stages of editing, these makeup stages were ultimately eliminated from the final cut, and the character looks generally the same throughout the film. Richard Meyers, author of The World of Fantasy Films, said actor Rebar was <b>impatient</b> and uncooperative with the extensive makeup sessions required for the effects, and thus did not wear all of the facial appliances Baker designed. This, Meyers said, {{might have been an}} additional factor in the lack of makeup effect stages in the final film. The version of the film shot by Sachs had not included any scenes with West before he sustained the radiation poisoning that caused his body to melt. Such scenes were, however, re-shot later by the producers without Sachs' participation.|$|E
5|$|Between 1956 and 1964 Manning's {{main project}} was The Balkan Trilogy, a {{sequence}} of three novels based on her experiences during the Second World War; as usual she was supported and encouraged by Reggie. The books describe the marriage of Harriet and Guy Pringle as they {{live and work in}} Romania and Greece, ending with their escape to Alexandria in 1941 just ahead of the Germans. Guy, a man at once admirable and unsatisfactory, and Harriet, a woman alternately proud and <b>impatient,</b> move from early passion to acceptance of difference. Manning described the books as long chapters of an autobiography, and early versions were written in the first person. There was significant fictionalisation, however. While Manning had been 31 and Reggie 25 at the outset of war, Manning's alter ego Harriet Pringle was a mere 21, and her husband a year older. Manning was a writer by profession, while her creation was not.|$|E
5|$|By early 1799, the French Directory {{had become}} <b>impatient</b> with {{stalling}} tactics employed by Austria. The uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested {{the timing was}} fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany. At the beginning of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced {{each other across the}} Rhine. Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance (Bodensee) to protect the Vorarlberg. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end of Lake Constance, only a day's march from French-held Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 940s Constantine {{was an old}} man, perhaps more than 70 years of age. The kingdom of Alba was too new to {{be said to have}} a {{customary}} rule of succession, but Pictish and Irish precedents favoured an adult successor descended from Kenneth MacAlpin. Constantine's surviving son Indulf, probably baptised in 927, would have been too young to be a serious candidate for the kingship in the early 940s, and the obvious heir was Constantine's nephew, MalcolmI. As Malcolm was born no later than 901, by the 940s he was no longer a young man, and may have been <b>impatient.</b> Willingly or not—the 11th-century Prophecy of Berchán, a verse history {{in the form of a}} supposed prophecy, states that it was not a voluntary decision—Constantine abdicated in 943 and entered a monastery, leaving the kingdom to Malcolm.|$|E
