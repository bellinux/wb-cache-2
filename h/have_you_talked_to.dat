I know your all right, and I won't <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> so! I ain't a bit jealous, Lem; indeed I ain't. I know you wouldn't fool with me, any more than I would with you; and that's what I tell 'Manda Grier, I'll leave it to her if I don't. I don't care who you go with, and I hain't, never since that first time. I know you ain't goin' to do {{anything}} underhanded. Don't go, Lem; oh, don't go!" ...|$|E
30|$|In {{contrast}} to these challenges, {{many of the}} nursing students credited supportive nursing faculty members with assisting them through the process to receive approval for testing accommodations. Students mentioned teachers on several occasions as the impetus or the support structure. Taylor shared, “I had a teacher that I went to and spoke {{with him in his}} office and he kind of told me that I needed to look into it and so I went to my doctor…he wrote a note for the school for the student services, and when I had that, then they set up accommodations for my testing.” She added, “Many of the teachers have this big open-door policy for everyone.” Emerson also noted, “and I went to talk to my professor and he was like, ‘are you sure you don’t have anxiety? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> your doctor about it?’ And I was like, ‘Yea, I have,’ but, I was just really in denial’ (fanning herself with her hands). And he was like, ‘you really should look into it, I think it would help a lot.’” Students appear to appreciate the support offered by their faculty members and suggest that many students would not make the effort to secure testing accommodations without the encouragement of their teachers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it is. You {{come and}} tease and say uncivil things, and I don't {{choose to be}} bullied. What right <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me about Mr. Newton? Did I ever give you any right? Honest indeed! What right <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me about being honest?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, don't bother about Mary now. Mrs. Huntingdon {{is dying}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her. Please do {{and if you}} like--I will give you one of my roses for your button-hole." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} have it so. In this matter, Emily, I will be master,--as it is fit that I should be. I will not <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> your father about Mr. Fletcher." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 13 November 2016, Zakharova drew {{criticism}} for joking on Russian state television that the U.S. election results {{were the result}} of a Jewish conspiracy, stating [...] "If {{you want to know what}} will happen in America, who do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to?</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> our people in Brighton Beach, naturally." [...] She also spoke in a stereotypical Jewish accent.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am tired," [...] she admitted, {{leading the}} way upstairs, [...] "only it will rest me much more <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me than to go to bed. Mine is {{scarcely}} a physical fatigue. My nerves are all quivering. I could not sleep! Tell me where <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Olive Halleck!" [...] cried Clara, [...] "I am {{not going}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> me in that way! <b>You</b> <b>have</b> no right to do it, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no {{business}} to do it," [...] she added, trying to pluck up a spirit. [...] "Is there anybody that I value more than I do you and your sisters, and Ben?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have taken}} a {{furnished}} cottage {{on the outskirts of}} this village, and {{a little more than a}} mile from Mallory Grange. But do not come to me. Dearly as I would love <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me, and hear from your own lips that all goes well, yet at present it were better not. I will devise some means of communication, and let you know of it shortly. I am living here as Mr. Angus.--Yours ever, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you; I'll {{sit here}} and rock little Vie to sleep for you. I don't care to read, but I'd like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me, for {{it seems as if}} I'd known you a long time and it does me good," [...] said Christie, as she settled herself and baby on the old settee which had served as a cradle for six young Wilkinses, and now {{received}} the honorable name of sofa in its old age.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Excellent Sharpe, {{how do you}} do?' exclaimed the Count. 'Castlefyshe, what bêtises <b>have</b> <b>you</b> been <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Crocky about Felix Winchester? Good Blandford, {{excellent}} Blandford, how is my good Blandford?' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "A dog has no {{politics}} or religion, {{so you can}} tell people about him freely, and when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> finished <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> them about themselves," [...] Trimble said.

6000|$|... “Voyons,” she continued, “why <b>have</b> <b>you</b> never <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me more? Is that a false note? Why haven’t {{you been}} ‘attentive’? That’s what American girls call it; that’s what Miss Ruck calls it.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{thought so}} too. Frank, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> known all that I have thought, {{and all that}} I <b>have</b> wished. <b>You</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me of marrying where my heart has been given. Is it {{possible}} that I should do so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is a {{new line}} for you to take," [...] he said. [...] "I should {{like to know what}} has {{suggested}} it. Has Mrs. Broadwood converted <b>you,</b> or <b>have</b> <b>you</b> been <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the Americans?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Voyons," [...] she continued, [...] "why <b>have</b> <b>you</b> never <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me more? Is that a false note? Why haven't {{you been}} 'attentive?' That's what American girls call it; that's what Miss Ruck calls it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To {{the end of}} {{all that}} is {{pleasant}} and easy and safe. Don't you remember my telling you how I dreaded the finish?

6000|$|... "I cannot {{tell you}} how glad I am to <b>have</b> <b>you,</b> Stanislas. I am getting better, but I am so weak that I took five hours, yesterday, to get six miles. Now I <b>have</b> got <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> I shall pick up {{strength}} faster than I have been doing, for {{it has been very}} dull work having no one who could understand me. There is only one man here who understands a word of Swedish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Vivian Grey," [...] said Mrs. Felix Lorraine, [...] "I cannot {{understand}} why <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Toad so long. Will you waltz?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right, that's all right, {{you may be}} sure, mother," [...] said Cohen, as if {{anxious to}} cut off inquiry on matters {{in which he was}} {{uncertain}} of the guest's position. [...] "So, sir," [...] he added, turning with a look of amused enlightenment to Deronda, [...] "it was better than learning <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Mordecai about! I wondered to myself at the time. I thought somehow there was a something." ...|$|R
6000|$|Write to me, {{and tell}} me of yourself. Do you {{remember}} what Rousseau said to some one--"Have we quarrelled? <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me often, and never once mentioned yourself." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't {{say such}} a thing, Lottie!" [...] said her mother. [...] "Your father loves all his {{children}} alike, and I won't <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> so <b>to</b> him.

60|$|Lau. Methinks {{yours is}} not very hard, for a serving-man's. But where, {{in the name of}} wonder, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> learned <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> so courtly? <b>You</b> are a strange valet de chambre.|$|R
6000|$|MR. WILLINGS. 'He was incredulous. Indeed, {{he seemed}} to think I was balmy. But I offered to bring him {{straight}} to you. I told him how much <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me about him.' ...|$|R
