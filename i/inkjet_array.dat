The UV light from the pinning system, typically {{lower than that of}} the full cure UV system, causes the UV ink to thicken, also known as gelling, but not fully cure. This ink thickening stops dot gain and holds the ink droplet pattern in place until it reaches the full cure UV system.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a global proposal and methodology for developing digital printed electronics (PE) prototypes, circuits and application specific printed electronics circuits (ASPECs). We start from a circuit specification using standard Hardware Description Languages (HDL) and executing its functional simulation. Then we perform logic synthesis that includes logic gate minimization by applying state-of-the-art algorithms embedded in our proposed electronic design automation (EDA) tools {{to minimize the}} number of transistors required to implement the circuit. Later technology mapping is applied, {{taking into account the}} available technology, (i. e., PMOS only technologies) and the cell design style (either Standard Cells or <b>Inkjet</b> Gate <b>Array).</b> These layout strategies are equivalent to those available in application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) flows but adapting them to Printed Electronics, which vary greatly depending on the targeted technology. Then Place & Route tools perform floorplan, placement and wiring of cells, which will be checked by the corresponding layout versus schematic (LVS). Afterwards we execute an electrical simulation including parasitic capacitances and relevant parameters. Finally, we obtain the prototypes which will be characterized and tested. The most important aspect of the proposed methodology is that it is portable to different PE processes, so that considerations and variations between different fabrication processes do not affect the validity of our approach. As final results, we present fabricated prototypes that are currently being characterized and tested...|$|R
40|$|Enhancement of {{the number}} and array density of nozzles within an inkjet head chip {{is one of the}} keys to raise the {{printing}} speed and printing resolutions. However, traditional 2 D architecture of driving circuits can not meet the requirement for high scanning speed and low data accessing points when nozzle numbers greater than 1000. This paper proposes a novel architecture of high-selection-speed three-dimensional data registration for inkjet applications. With the configuration of three-dimensional data registration, the number of data accessing points as well as the scanning lines can be greatly reduced for large <b>array</b> <b>inkjet</b> printheads with nozzles numbering more than 1000. This IC (Integrated Circuit) architecture involves three-dimensional multiplexing with the provision of a gating transistor for each ink firing resistor, where ink firing resistors are triggered only by the selection of their associated gating transistors. Three signals : selection (S), address (A), and power supply (P), are employed together to activate a nozzle for droplet ejection. The smart printhead controller has been designed by a 0. 35 um CMOS process with a total circuit area, 2500 ղ 500 μm 2, which is 80 % of the cirucuit area by 2 D configuration for 1000 nozzles.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} work, {{solution}} dispensing techniques have been employed for {{the realization of}} complex biological <b>arrays.</b> <b>Inkjet</b> printing techniques were employed for the generation of drug screening platforms. This approach was initially proved with a model enzyme system like Glucose Oxidase substrate covalently linked to a functionalized silicon oxide support. On this support an enzymatic substrate (D-glucose) /inhibitor (D-glucal) couple was accurately dispensed. A simple optical detection method was used to prove the screening capability of the microarray with the possibility to assay with high reproducibility at the single spot level. Afterwards, this methodology has been extended to CYP 450 enzymes like CYP 3 A 4, {{one of the main}} targets for the phase I drug metabolism via a droplet microreactors arrays containing CYP 3 A 4 enzyme mixed with model inhibitors (erythromycin) and enzymatic chemiluminescent substrates (Luciferin-Isopropylacetate). The enzymatic activity was detected by using easy and low cost optical measurements of spot brightness. As a second main objective, high-throughput and multiplexed Dip Pen Nanopatterning methodologies in liquid format were combined with Proteic Ligand DNA-Directed Immobilization for the creation of complex protein biochips on modified glass surfaces displaying spots of cell-specific ligands with lateral dimensions minor than one single cell. In a first application the epidermal growth factor (EFG) protein arrays were realized to display specific single cell adhesion activity. As a second application, immobilized proteic ligands were used to recruit designed cellular receptors which presented intracellular protein domain whose interaction with a cytosolic binding partner was monitored and perturbated...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project is to demonstrate an ultra-effective light extraction mechanism that can be universally applied to all top-emitting white OLEDs (TE-WOLEDs) and can be integrated with thin film encapsulation techniques. The scope of work proposed in this project includes four major areas: (1) optical modeling; (2) microlens and array fabrication; (3) fabrication, encapsulation, and characterization of TE-WOLEDs; and (4) full device integration and characterization. First, the light extraction efficiency in a top-emitting OLED {{with or without a}} microlens array are modeled using wave optics. Second, individual microlenses and microlens arrays are fabricated by inkjet printing of microdroplets of a liquid thiol-ene monomer with high refractive index followed by photopolymerization. Third, high efficiency top-emitting white OLEDs are fabricated, and fully characterized. Finally, optimized microlens arrays are fabricated on TE-WOLEDs with dielectric barrier layers. The overall light extraction efficiency of these devices, as well as its wavelength and angular dependencies, are measured by comparing the efficiencies of devices with and without microlens arrays. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the feasibility of applying <b>inkjet</b> printed microlens <b>arrays</b> to enhance the light extraction efficiency of top-emitting white OLEDs. We have shown that the geometry (contact angle) of the printed microlenses can be controlled by controlling the surface chemistry prior to printing the lenses. A 90 % enhancement in the light extraction efficiency has been achieved with printed microlens array on a top-emitting white OLED, which can be further improved to 140 % using a more close-packed microlens array fabricated from a molding process. Future work will focus on improvement of the microlens fabrication process to improve the array fill factor and the contact angle, as well as use transparent materials with a higher index of refraction. We will also further optimize the procedures for integrating the microlenses on the top-emitting white OLEDs and characterize the overall light extraction enhancement factor when the microlens array is attached...|$|R
40|$|Dynamics of drops forming from {{capillaries}} and nozzles {{and that}} of stretching liquid bridges are not only fundamentally important scientific problems but they also {{lie at the heart}} of many applications including <b>inkjet</b> printing, biochip <b>arraying,</b> spray coating, filament-stretching rheometry, and gravure coating where the working fluid is often non-Newtonian. A major goal of this thesis is to develop accurate and efficient computational methods to predict the dynamics and breakup of drops and bridges of non-Newtonian liquids. The theoretical approach consists of Galerkin/finite element analysis of the full two-dimensional (2 -d) set of equations and a one-dimensional (1 -d) approximation based on slender jet theory governing the dynamics. A comparison of predictions made with the 1 -d and 2 -d algorithms in the case of Newtonian and shear-thinning liquid bridges is presented here for the first time and at the outset in order to establish when the 1 -d theory is accurate. The thesis then goes on to tackle a number of increasingly more difficult situations using slender jet theory. The 1 -d algorithm is used here for the first time to follow not only the creation of satellite droplets but whether they persist or get eliminated by merging with the primary drop. Unlike previous studies, this work also examines the effect of both simple and complex non-Newtonian rheology on the physics of interface rupture. First a generalized Newtonian fluid model accounting for shear thinning and strain hardening and then a more complex and fully viscoelastic fluid model that treats the polymer molecules as so-called FENE dumbbells are utilized. The 1 -d algorithm is also utilized to put on firm theoretical footing the century-old drop weight method for measuring surface tension. Experimental observations based on high-speed digital imaging are utilized to motivate and support the theoretical studies. While such studies are important in their own right, they also point out deficiencies in existing theoretical models and aid in the development of a new technique for the measurement of extensional viscosity of viscoelastic fluids. A filament stretching rheometer based on a liquid bridge design is built here in order to probe extensional properties of polymer solutions. ...|$|R
