5|$|Development of Sonic Advance {{began after}} Sega shifted their focus to {{third-party}} software development, {{due to the}} underperformance of the Dreamcast. The company recruited Dimps—a Japanese development studio consisting of former Neo Geo Pocket Color programmers—to lead <b>development,</b> <b>with</b> the assistance of longtime series developer Sonic Team. While the game follows a similar style of gameplay to the Sega Genesis Sonic games, certain concepts and designs were re-used from newer titles such as Sonic Adventure.

The game was originally called Rainbow Six Unbreakable, a title that reflected not only the game's destruction mechanic but also the mindset of the development team, who had to deliver a game that was once stuck in development hell. According to Alexandre Remy, the brand director, the team was confident in their new vision for the game but very nervous when they revealed it, realizing the change of direction would likely disappoint some fans.|$|E

5|$|Flatfish are {{demersal}} fish (bottom-feeding fish) that show {{a greater degree}} of asymmetry than any other vertebrates.

This has the advantage that, when they lie on the seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view.
