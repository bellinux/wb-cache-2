40|$|Descriptions of soil {{hydraulic}} properties, such as {{the soil}} moisture retention curve, θ (h), and saturated hydraulic conductivities, <b>K</b> <b>s,</b> are a prerequisite for hydrological models. Since the measurement of <b>K</b> <b>s</b> is expensive, it is frequently derived from statistical pedotransfer functions (PTFs). Because it is usually more difficult to describe <b>K</b> <b>s</b> than θ (h) from pedotransfer functions, Pollacco et al.  (2013) developed a physical unimodal model to compute <b>K</b> <b>s</b> solely from hydraulic parameters derived from the Kosugi θ (h). This unimodal <b>K</b> <b>s</b> model, {{which is based on}} a unimodal Kosugi soil pore-size distribution, was developed by combining the approach of Hagen–Poiseuille with Darcy's law and by introducing three tortuosity parameters. We report here on (1)  the suitability of the Pollacco unimodal <b>K</b> <b>s</b> model to predict <b>K</b> <b>s</b> for a range of New Zealand soils from the New Zealand soil database (S-map) and (2)  further adaptations to this model to adapt it to dual-porosity structured soils by computing the soil water flux through a continuous function of an improved bimodal pore-size distribution. The improved bimodal <b>K</b> <b>s</b> model was tested with a New Zealand data set derived from historical measurements of <b>K</b> <b>s</b> and θ (h) for a range of soils derived from sandstone and siltstone. The <b>K</b> <b>s</b> data were collected using a small core size of 10  cm diameter, causing large uncertainty in replicate measurements. Predictions of <b>K</b> <b>s</b> were further improved by distinguishing topsoils from subsoil. Nevertheless, as expected, stratifying the data with soil texture only slightly improved the predictions of the physical <b>K</b> <b>s</b> models because the <b>K</b> <b>s</b> model is based on pore-size distribution and the calibrated parameters were obtained within the physically feasible range. The improvements made to the unimodal <b>K</b> <b>s</b> model by using the new bimodal <b>K</b> <b>s</b> model are modest when compared to the unimodal model, which is explained by the poor accuracy of measured total porosity. Nevertheless, the new bimodal model provides an acceptable fit to the observed data. The study highlights the importance of improving <b>K</b> <b>s</b> measurements with larger cores...|$|R

40|$|This study compares {{saturated}} hydraulic conductivities (<b>K</b> <b>s)</b> {{of three}} sandy soils such as coarse, medium and fine sand.

Column drainage tests were performed to characterize the water retention properties of the samples, which are required in the REPM. Bench scale tracer tests with various conditions were conducted to obtain reasonable linear velocities of the samples using breakthrough curve analyses and then <b>K</b> <b>s</b> was estimated using Darcy’s law. For the REPM, the differences of <b>K</b> <b>s</b> for the coarse and fine sand soils were less than one order of magnitude; however, the difference of <b>K</b> <b>s</b> values between the empirical methods and the breakthrough curve analyses was larger than one order of magnitude.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on the silicon limited growth and nutrient kinetics of Stephanodiscus minutus Grun. was examined using batch and semicontinuous culture methods. Short-term batch culture methods gave maximum growth rates which were essentially constant over the temperature range of 10 ° to 20 °C (Μ 3 = 0. 71 – 0. 80 d − 1). The half-saturation constant for growth (<b>K</b> <b>s)</b> was significantly lowest at 10 °C (<b>K</b> <b>s</b> = 0. 31 ΜM Si; 0. 22 – 0. 41), and higher at both 15 °C (<b>K</b> <b>s</b> = 1. 03 ΜM Si; 0. 68 – 1. 47) and 20 °C (<b>K</b> <b>s</b> = 0. 88 ΜM Si; 0. 60 – 1. 22). Two methods {{were used to}} evaluate the semicontinuous experiments. The Droop relationship showed that the minimum cell quota was about 1. 50 × 10 − 7 nmol Si cell − 1, but there was much overlap in the results at all three temperatures. The Monod growth relationship for the semicontinuous experiments gave estimates of <b>K</b> <b>s</b> which were lowest at 15 °C (<b>K</b> <b>s</b> = 0. 12 ΜM Si), and higher at 10 °C (<b>K</b> <b>s</b> = 0. 68 ΜM Si) and 20 °C (<b>K</b> <b>s</b> = 1. 24 ΜM Si), although 95 % confidence intervals overlapped. The maximum growth rate estimates for the semicontinuous experiments were similar at 10 ° and 15 °, and higher at 20 °C, but the number of points used in making the calculations makes the results less reliable than those from batch cultures. Generally, there were no consistent significant differences in the silicon limited growth of S. minutus over the temperature range studied. Our values of <b>K</b> <b>s</b> for S. minutus are the lowest recorded for a freshwater diatom, and are consistent with the distribution of this species in nature.
