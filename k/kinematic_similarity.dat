40|$|The Palaeozoic North-Armorican {{shear zone}} (NASZ) (Brittany, France) is {{described}} as an E-W trending dextral, intracontinental shear zone. In {{the valley of the}} Queffleuth river, we outline a well-exposed zone of protocataclasite to cataclasite as the Queffleuth cataclastic zone (QCZ). Four morphological fault classes are defined in the QCZ based on the petrographic characteristics of the fault planes. The first fault class is clearly related to cataclasis, as the matrix/clast ratio increases and the clast size decreases towards the individual fault planes. The other three morphological classes cross-cut the cataclasite and are therefore considered to postdate cataclasis. A palaeostress analysis allowed to distinguish five distinct stress states, which are dominated by oblique to pure strike-slip N-S trending faults, that are oriented antithetic with respect to the overall trend of the NASZ. Both dextral and sinistral E-W kinematics are inferred for the QCZ. Because all morphological fault classes are identified in each of the stress states, dextral and sinistral kinematics must have occurred during and after cataclasis.

40|$|The {{kinematics}} {{of feeding}} on two prey types is studied quantitatively {{in the common}} snapping turtle, Chelydra serpentina, to provide a description of prey capture mechanisms and to determine whether kinematic patterns can be altered in response to prey that vary in escape capability. High-speed video recordings of prey capture (200 fields s" 1) provide data for field-by-field analysis of 12 kinematic variables characterizing head and neck movement. Feedings on fish were accomplished in 78 ms, with peak head extension velocities of 152. 5 cms" 1. Worm feedings lasted 98 ms with maximum head extension velocities of 54 cms" 1. Both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses demonstrate significant differences in kinematic patterns between fish and earthworm feedings: Chelydra serpentina possesses the ability to modulate its kinematic pattern depending on the prey. The pattern of bone movement during the fast opening phase of the gape cycle {{is similar to that}} found in ray-finned fishes, lungfishes and aquatic salamanders. However, movements of the cranium and lower jaw during the closing phase are markedly different. Our data show Chelydra to be predominantly a ram-feeder, with any intraoral negative pressures generated during the strike having a negligible effect on the prey, which remains largely stationary relative to a fixed background. Hyoid and esophageal expansion during the closing phase may function to allow a unidirectional flow of water and prey into the mouth until the gape closes and to delay reverse flow until the prey has been trapped inside the mouth.

40|$|The barbell back-squat {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{exercises}} in strength and conditioning practice; especially in Olympic weightlifting and powerlifting. There are two main bar placements within the back-squat; the high-bar and low-bar positions. The high-bar position, favoured by Olympic weightlifters, closely resembles the upright body position of the two competition lifts of the sport; the snatch and clean and jerk. The low-bar position, favoured by powerlifters, typically allows greater loads to be lifted by utilising the posterior-chain musculature during the back-squat (one of the three competition lifts in the sport). Unfortunately, little research exists comparing the high-bar back-squat with the low-bar back-squat, and no research has examined either lift above 90 % of one repetition maximum. Furthermore, no authors have biomechanically compared the high-bar back-squat to the Olympic lifts (e. g. snatch and clean and jerk). The aims of this thesis were to (1) review the current literature and quantitatively assess the kinetic and kinematic findings among the limited research; (2) compare and contrast the high-bar back-squat and low-bar back-squat up to maximal effort; and (3) assess the differences and/or similarities between the high-bar back-squat and the Olympic lifts. Through an extensive literature review, the high-bar back-squat was found to commonly present a larger hip angle, smaller knee angle and equivalent ankle angle compared to the low-bar back-squat; inferring the high-bar placement creates a more upright truck position for the lifter and requires more quadriceps muscle activation. Experimentally, these findings were confirmed with the high-bar back-squat producing larger hip angles and smaller knee angles compared to the powerlifters (16 – 21 % larger and 10 – 12 % smaller, respectively) and low-bar controls (16 – 21 % larger and 10 – 12 % smaller, respectively). While the Olympic weightlifters and powerlifters lifted similar relative loads, the low-bar controls were able to lift 2. 5 – 5. 2 % larger relative loads compared to the high-bar controls. As expected, the high-bar back-squat also showed similar kinematics to the snatch and the clean but substantially different kinetics across all loads lifted. Performing a back-squat with a low-bar placement, situates the lifter (advanced and recreational) in a stronger position to lift larger loads compared to the high-bar placement. The establishment of a more advantageous kinematic posture during the low-bar back-squat could potentially maximise the utilisation of the stronger posterior hip musculature thus increasing the stability and moment arm at the hip. The low-bar back-squat therefore appears to provide the best chance of lifting the largest relative load. The <b>kinematic</b> <b>similarities</b> in posture between the high-bar back-squat and the Olympic lifts suggests the potential of similar trunk, hip and thigh muscular activity of key stabilising muscles and repetitive positional alignment in the “catch” position. The differing kinetics however, are more likely due to technical differences between the high-bar back-squat, snatch and clean; wherein the Olympic lifts require additional elements of upper-body strength and stability. The high-bar back-squat does appear to yield an efficient carryover to the Olympic lifts as a suitable supplementary exercise; provided the technical components of the lifts are maintained...|$|R
40|$|The power clean {{exercise}} is commonly prescribed to athletes involved in strength and power sports {{due to the}} <b>kinematic</b> <b>similarities</b> that this exercise has to key phases during jumping and sprinting (e. g. explosive hip, knee and ankle extension). Another popular method to improve athletic performance and lower body power is training with a weighted vest (WV) (i. e. centralised loading) as it allows individuals to perform sports specific movements such as jumping and sprinting in an overloaded fashion. Weighted vest training {{may also be a}} possible alternative loading method that could allow individuals to continue to train with full body explosive exercises without being limited by the technique and mobility demands. However, it is currently unknown what effect this loading method has on full body explosive movements such as the power clean. Therefore this thesis sought to investigate the acute and longitudinal effects of centralised loading on the performance of the power clean exercise and athletic performance. The purpose of the first {{study was to determine the}} optimal load to be worn during the performance of the power clean exercise. This was achieved by comparing the acute kinematic and kinetic effects of performing the power clean with loads of 50 % and 70 % 1 RM across three conditions in nine recreationally trained males; 1) no Exo-skeleton, 2) 5 % bodyweight Exo-skeleton and, 3) 12 % body mass Exo-skeleton. Four of the kinematic variables measured were technique variables which were; 1) most forward position to catch (DxL), 2) start position to catch (DxT), 3) start position to beginning of 2 nd pull (Dx 2), and 4) 2 nd pull position to catch (DxV). It was concluded that the optimal Exo-skeleton load to be worn during the power clean was a load ~ 12 % of a lifter’s bodyweight and such loading may positively influence kinematic and kinetic variables during power clean performance. Following the results from study one, a five week power clean training intervention was devised to determine and compare the longitudinal kinematic, kinetic and performance effects of wearing a weighted Exo-skeleton vs. no Exo-skeleton. Sixteen resistance trained males were randomly assigned to either a no Exo-skeleton or a 12 % bodyweight Exo-skeleton group. Training with the 12 % Exo-skeleton resulted in a number of desirable technique changes (as determined by the variables noted above) that included increases in the rearward displacement of the barbell, increases in barbell velocity, and improved peak power outputs. Furthermore, the cumulative effect of improved lifting kinematics, barbell velocity, and PP resulted in the 12 % Exo-skeleton group improving the CMJ by 8. 5 % and 1 RM power clean performance by 4. 6 %. Conversely, the no Exo-skeleton group demonstrated only a mild increase in 1 RM power clean performance (1. 9 %) and a decrease in CMJ performance (- 1. 5 %). In conclusion, training with a 12 % Exo-skeleton is a viable alternative loading method for resistance trained males who wish to improve their power clean ability (both technique and performance) and CMJ performance...|$|R

Methods: Sixty-nine participants with a 6 -month history of first-time lateral ankle sprain and 20 non-injured controls completed three 20 -second unilateral stance task trials in conditions 1 and 2.

For MatIV, we also investigated the evolution of mean erosion rates and stream power erosion law exponents in 1 D {{as a function of}} slope.;Our results indicate that MatIV satisfies most of the defined criteria. It deforms brittlely according to the linear Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion and localizes deformation along discrete faults. Its erosion pattern is characterized by realistic hillslope and channelized processes (slope diffusion, mass wasting, channel incision). During transport, eroded particles are sorted depending on their density and shape, which results in stratified alluvial deposits displaying lateral fades variations. To evaluate the degree of similitude between model and nature, we used a new experimental device that combines accretionary wedge deformation mechanisms and surface runoff erosion processes. Results indicate that MatIV succeeded in producing detailed morphological and sedi-mentological features (drainage basin, channel network, terrace, syntectonic alluvial fan). Geometric, <b>kinematic</b> and dynamic <b>similarity</b> criteria have been investigated to compare precisely model to nature. Although scaling is incomplete, it yields particularly informative orders of magnitude. With all these characteristics, MatIV appears as a very promising material to investigate experimentally a wide range of scientific questions dealing with relief dynamics and interactions between tectonics, erosion and sedimentation processes...|$|R
