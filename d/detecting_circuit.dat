40|$|A robust {{cellular}} counter {{could enable}} synthetic biologists to design complex circuits with diverse behaviors. The existing synthetic-biological counters, {{responsive to the}} beginning of the pulse, are sensitive to the pulse duration. Here we present a pulse <b>detecting</b> <b>circuit</b> that responds only at the falling edge of a pulse-analogous to negative edge triggered electric circuits. As biological events do not follow precise timing, use of such a pulse detector would enable the design of robust asynchronous counters which can count the completion of events.

At the end of the pulse the unstable inhibitor protein disappears from the cell and the second protein triggers the recording of the event completion. Using stochastic simulation we showed that the proposed design can detect the completion of the pulse irrespective to the pulse duration. In our simulation we also showed that fusing the pulse detector with a phage lambda memory element we can construct a counter which can be extended to count larger numbers.
