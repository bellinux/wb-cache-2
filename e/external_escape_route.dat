50|$|Banks, {{cuttings}} and fences that trap {{animals on}} the road are associated with roadkill. In order to {{increase the likelihood of}} escape from a main roadway, <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> have been constructed on the access roads. <b>Escape</b> <b>routes</b> may be considered {{as one of the most}} useful measures, especially when new roads are being built or roads are being upgraded, widened or sealed. Research may be undertaken into the efficacy of <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> by observations of animals’ response to vehicles in places with natural <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> and barriers, rather than trialing purpose-built <b>escape</b> <b>routes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Due to the {{inherent}} fire risk in occupancies, it necessary {{that they are}} provided with suitable and sufficient <b>escape</b> <b>route</b> in case of fire emergency. This will ensure that occupants can get {{to a place of}} relative safety within the shortest period of time without travelling excessive distances or encountering hindrances. This paper is resultant of a study conducted on fourteen commercial highrise buildings in Nairobi CBD. It assesses essential fire <b>escape</b> <b>route</b> elements {{in the light of the}} requirements of the national regulations, laws and standards. Inspections, questionnaire survey, document review and interviews were used in the research. One hundred and nine (109) occupants responded to the questions poised to capture their perception, attitude and opinion on the escape route/s at their workstations. In the assessment 85. 71 % of the surveyed <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> exhibited insufficient or unsuitable fire elements while only 7. 14 % of the buildings had sufficient and/or suitable and 7. 14 % had no escape stairs at all. Further, the results of the study show that, although fire <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> are required as an integral part of the fire safety strategy, there still exist deficiencies in their provision. Unclear or no exit signage, obstruction and locking; poor <b>escape</b> <b>route</b> planning, lack of alternative <b>escape</b> <b>route</b> and the condition of fire doors are some of the challenges found with <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> in the buildings. In view of the results, <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> should be adequate, easily accessible, properly marked, well lit and have in place requisite facilities to enable easy movement and safety of the people. The <b>escape</b> <b>route</b> should also be routinely inspected to ensure no inhibitions are found to prevent people from using the route effectively. Lastly, the responsible authorities and persons should make sure that inspections are done and records made on remedial actions undertaken to correct present hazardous situation/s.

40|$|If an {{undesired}} event occurs is {{the possibility}} of escape of crucial importance for the safety of passengers and crew. It is therefore important to have good solutions on escape routes; in this matter is the design and orientation of <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> essential. If an emergency situation occurs and the <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> are insufficient, may this result in difficulties for passengers to escape from the area in an effective and successfully matter. An offshore development can never be completely safe, but by selecting the optimum design may the risk be reduced to a level that is as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP). However, this requires identification of risk contributors and their assessment, which should be done by using QRA techniques early in the project life cycle (Khan & Amyotte, 2002). It is uncertain to which degree the <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> are prioritized, evaluated and considered in such a process, and if it is the best practice used. This is due to that there are few requirements regarding how <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> should be evaluated in a risk analysis in the legislations. This thesis evaluates how <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> are taken into account in two different risk analyses. This is done by the use of five success criterias; clear description of the installation, simulations, calculations, assumptions and uncertainties. The discussion indicated that there were improvement potentials for how to evaluate <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> in the risk analysis in order to reach a robust solution. The thesis also discusses whether the requirements to design are sufficient to reach robust <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> solutions, or not.

40|$|It {{often happens}} that we don't realize the {{importance}} of fire <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> until something happens, because we find the possibilities for a real accident too trivial. The purpose of this diploma thesis was to establish the actual condition of the fire <b>escape</b> <b>route</b> at the Faculty of Civil and Geodetic Engineering in Ljubljana. The diploma describes prerequisites for a fire, its development, as well as the characteristics of an <b>escape</b> <b>route</b> and evacuation time. Thanks to computer development, we now have access to different fire simulation software which provides us with extremely realistic data without anyone getting hurt in the process. I used Fire Dynamics Simulator software to simulate the fire and Pathfinder for the simulation of an <b>escape</b> <b>route.</b> For best results when planning fire <b>escape</b> <b>routes,</b> we must presume the worst-case scenarios. This diploma describes 5 variants, differing in the location of fire initiation and potential improvements, which are based on TSG- 1 - 001 : 2010 Fire Safety in Buildings technical guidelines. I noted evacuation times, fire temperatures, levels of CO and CO 2, smoke movements, and how the <b>escape</b> <b>route</b> is transient. As a result, my diploma shows that this building doesn’t comply with technical guidelines, which could cause harm to users in the event of fire...|$|R

A new mobile integrated measuring and analysis system was used to achieve high sample rates and a long measurement time. Due to the mobility of the sensors, tracer gas experiments were also carried out inside running subway coaches. All experiments showed a common pattern: the pathways of tracer gas dispersion overlapped with some <b>escape</b> <b>routes,</b> which were contaminated within a few minutes. So in case of catastrophic circumstances like terrorist attacks or subway fires, some <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> will become deathly traps, but the results also showed free <b>escape</b> <b>routes.</b> With the new sensor technique {{it will be possible}} to conduct safety assessments for <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> in underground transportation facilities...|$|R

50|$|As {{building}} codes became {{more common in}} countries {{around the turn of}} the 20th century, fire safety became an important concern for new construction.

As {{building codes}} evolved and more safety concerns addressed over subsequent editions, all construction above a certain number of stories was required to have a second means of egress, and <b>external</b> fire <b>escapes</b> were allowed as a retrofit option for existing buildings prior to the post-World War II period.|$|R
