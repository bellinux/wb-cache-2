40|$|In {{this work}} we {{performed}} a biogeographic study of two genera of Amazonian land snails, Megalobulimus (Strophocheilidae) and Systrophia (Scolodontidae). We used samples from {{different regions of the}} Peruvian Amazon, as well as bibliographic information. We analyzed both nuclear (5. 8 S-ITS 2 - 28 S rRNA) and mitochondrial (16 S rRNA) genes to reconstruct phylogenies and obtain hypotheses concerning the evolutionary relationships among Amazonian genera and other species with global distribution. The nuclear phylogeny allowed us to determine the evolutionary position of both genera, and the mitochondrial phylogeny permitted the differentiation of species at the intrageneric level. We found that Megalobulimus clustered with the non-achatinoid clade within Stylommatophora, as expected, but its relationship to family Acavidae could not be demonstrated. Systrophia did not cluster with any of the two established clades, but formed a basal one within Stylommatophora. The mitochondrial gene 16 S rRNA allowed us to differentiate Megalobulimus species, and performed well for DNA barcoding of these <b>edible</b> <b>snails.</b> Biogeographical analysis revealed several endemic species in the Peruvian Amazon within both genera, highlighting the Chanchamayo and Inambari biogeographic units...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUNDAn {{increasing}} interest in snail farming in Greece and other European countries has been observed. Despite {{the fact that}} <b>edible</b> <b>snails</b> {{have been involved with}} problems of Salmonella spp. contamination, there are to our knowledge only limited studies regarding microbiological safety and hygiene of such products. Enumeration of microbial populations and presence/absence of Salmonella spp. in snail meat and intestines of wild Cornu aspersum, Helix lucorum and cultured Cornu aspersum snails from indoor/outdoor type farms was conducted. Furthermore, snail-processing steps were simulated in the laboratory and the population reduction in snail meat was determined. RESULTSMicrobial populations were higher in intestines than snail meat in almost all cases. Escherichia coli/coliforms and Enterococcus spp. populations were lower in the intestines and snail meat of cultured C. aspersum. Salmonella spp. were detected in the intestines and snail meat of wild snails only. The high levels of bacterial populations were considerably reduced after the appropriate processing. CONCLUSIONThe lower populations of E. coli/coliforms, Enterococcus spp. and especially the absence of Salmonella spp. in cultured snails show that the controlled conditions decrease the possibility of pathogen presence and contribute to food safety and public health.

40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} of the present research was {{to carry out a}} comparative assessment of copper, zinc, and selenium concentrations in the meat of edible land snails collected in Poland (Helix pomatia, Cornu aspersum maxima, and Cornu aspersum aspersum), as well as to determine the effect of preliminary processing of Roman snails (Helix pomatia) on the content of the aforementioned elements. Material and Methods: In the first stage, determinations were made on unprocessed snail meat. In the second stage, the study focused on Roman snails and consisted in an additional evaluation of frozen meat after full processing. Zinc and copper contents were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry and the selenium content was established by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: The selenium content differed significantly among all three species. The copper content in Roman snails differed significantly from that in farmed snails. No significant difference in the zinc level was noted among the three snail species. The selenium content in raw and processed meat of Roman snails did not show any significant difference while the copper and zinc level was significantly higher in processed meat samples. Conclusion: The present research on the meat of <b>edible</b> <b>snails</b> showed different levels of selenium, copper, and zinc, depending on the species, collection site, and subjection to processing...|$|E

40|$|Summary- Genetic {{parameters}} of adult weight, age at maturity (adult age), weight after hibernation and relative loss of weight during hibernation were estimated {{in a population}} of <b>edible</b> <b>snails</b> (Helix aspersa Miiller). Eight thousand four hundred and eighthy three animals were sampled from 143 pairs for adult weight, 4 333 from 87 pairs for adult age and 2 256 from 123 pairs for traits after hibernation. An animal model taking into account all the relationships was used to estimate genetic parameters. Estimates were also computed from the covariances between full-sibs and parent offspring regressions to assess possible non-additive genetic effects. Heritabilities were high except for relative loss of weight during hibernation. Estimates from the animal model were 0. 48 f 0. 04 for adult weight, 0. 40 f 0. 05 for adult age, 0. 40 ! 0. 05 for weight after hibernation and 0. 12 iL 0. 03 for relative loss of weight during hibernation. Adult weight and adult age were neither phenotypically nor genetically correlated (0. 05 and 0. 003 f 0. 07, respectively).

40|$|Land snails are {{sources of}} protein to man and are hosts {{to a number}} of parasites. It is {{imperative}} that the roles of the snail hosts and parasites are clearly defined. Before then however, the parasites of the different land snails collected in any locality should be identified. Land snails were collected in the wild in both dry and wet seasons. The internal organs and the faeces were examined for the presence of parasite. In the rainy season of 2015, a total of 272 snails were collected across four major towns (Benin, Uromi, Ekpoma and Auchi) in Edo State, Nigeria, while in the dry season, fewer snails (n= 91) were handpicked. The snail species seen are: Achatina achatina (Linnaeus, 1758), Achatina fulica (Férussac, 1821), Acharchatina marginata (Swainson, 1982), Limicolaria aurora (Jay, 1839), L. flammea (Müller, 1774) and Limicolariopsis spp. The larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis were isolated from the various snail species with overall prevalence of 54. 04 %. Snails positive with Alaria mesocercariae were L. aurora, L. flammea and Limicolariopsis spp. Additionally, few L. flammea were positive of the cercariae of Drocoelium dedriticum. Meanwhile, some samples of A. fulica harboured larvae of Angiostrongylus cantonesis, sporocysts of Fasciola gigantica and Schistosoma mansoni.

Data on Limicolaria flammea and Limicolaria aurora were pooled together to simulate their occurrence in nature and presentation in the markets. They were designated as Limicolaria flammea / aurora throughout this study. The results showed that there was no significant (P> 0. 05) difference between the dressing out percentages of the three study group of snails. However, all body component parts studied were significantly (P 0. 05), indicating some regular pattern of weight distribution for these mollusk species studied.

40|$|The {{intestinal}} microbiota of the <b>edible</b> <b>snails</b> Cornu aspersum fSyn: H. aspersa), and Helix pomatia were investigated by culture-based methods, 16 S rRNA sequence analyses and phenotypic characterisations. The study {{was carried out}} on aestivating snails and two populations of H. pomatia were considered. The cultivable bacteria dominated in the distal part of the intestine, with up to 5. 10 (9) CFU g - 1, but the Swedish H. pomatia appeared significantly less colonised, suggesting a higher sensitivity of its microbiota to climatic change. All the strains, but one, shared &# 8805; 97 % sequence identity with reference strains. They were arranged into two taxa: the Gamma Proteobacteria with Buttiauxella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Kluyvera, Obesumbacterium, Raoultella and the Firmicutes with Enterococcus, Lactococcus, and Clostridium.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the present}} work was to study the effect of Cd 2 + {{exposure}} on metallothionein (MT) induction and {{on the distribution of}} metals (Cd, Cu, and Zn) in the terrestrial pulmonate Helix aspersa. In particular, the soluble and nonsoluble pools of the accumulated metals and their tissue distribution in uncontaminated and contaminated <b>edible</b> <b>snails</b> were investigated after a two-week exposure to Cd 2 +. In the soluble cytosolic pool of the midgut gland of H. aspersa, three metal-specific putative MT isoforms were separated following a fractionation protocol with diethylaminoethyl cellulose, size-exclusion chromatography, ultrafiltration, and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Interestingly, one of the above isoforms seems to bind both Cd and Cu, which may in addition mobilize, after induction by Cd 2 +, some of the intracellular Cu and, thus, perhaps increase the Cu pool in the cytosolic fraction. The cDNA and its translated amino acid sequence of a Cd 2 +-binding MT isoform from the snail midgut gland was characterized and attributed to one of the putative MT isoforms obtained by RP-HPLC. The amino acid sequence of this Cd-MT isoform of H. aspersa differed from similar sequences described in other terrestrial pulmonates, such as Helix pomatia or Arianta arbustorum, by only a few amino acids (n = 4 and 8, respectively). That the identified Cd-MT from H. aspersa is inducible by Cd 2 + also was shown, chromatographic evidence aside, by a specific polymerase chain reaction protocol on a cDNA basis, which included a noninducible housekeeping gene as a control...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Entire {{livelihood}} {{of farmers}} in plains of Tripura {{is dependent on}} rice based farming systems (RBFS). A good rice crop brings smile to the family and locality and a poor crop brings misery and makes farmers debt ridden. Traditionally, about 5 - 10 % of available farm area is given for water harvesting for life saving irrigation during dry season and most importantly for growing fish and domestic use. The water harvested in ponds is used for lifesaving irrigation of vegetables (15 - 20 % farm area) fruits, etc. grown around rice fields or adjacent to home yards. Lowland rice fields and lungas (depressed area in between hills/lowlands) are major ecosystems for indigenous small fish species. The demand and taste of indigenous fish are {{much better than the}} improved fishes like Indian major carps, exotic carps etc. Rice ecosystem is also the major habitat for crabs, eels, <b>edible</b> <b>snails,</b> roots etc. that provides nutrition to thousands in northeastern region. Livestock like cattle, buffaloes, poultry etc. are the integral part of the RBFS. The animal component not only contributes to the manure stock and livelihood of small and marginal farmers but also empowers women and children. The fertility of rice fields are maintained over the centuries through efficient residue recycling, livestock penning, application of organic manure and composts etc. The strength of the indigenous RBFS is that there is hardly any case of starvation death or suicide in the state or in the region which is frequent news {{in other parts of the}} country.

The nation's media, too, have an active part, with television advertisements promoting the use of biological control agents appearing daily on all TV stations. A second television advertisement, advocating the proper use of pesticides, is scheduled for broadcast soon. Results in the country have been good, with rice farmers claiming that IPM practices are increasing their yields by more than four tonnes per hectare. In addition, reduction in pesticide use has allowed fish, crabs and <b>edible</b> <b>snails</b> to return to paddy fields, improving both food supply and income for local farmers In the effort to move away from the use of dangerous environmentally-damaging pesticides, some farmers are beginnin 9 to manufacture their own.
