5000|$|Railway {{companies}} in the United Kingdom did not use inspection locomotives. Instead dedicated carriages (known as Inspection Saloons) were used. These were either rebuilt from obsolete coaching stock or, occasionally, were newly built. However many companies maintained dedicated locomotives to haul Inspection Saloons. These were usually elderly engines that had been famous top-rank express locomotives when new but had since been surpassed. Examples of such engines include the Caledonian Railway Single, LNWR No.3020 'Cornwall' and NER No. 66 'Aerolite'. Dugald Drummond, when Chief Mechanical Engineer of the London and South Western Railway had a small 4-2-4 tank locomotive with a small saloon body mounted on its rear to serve as his personal transport around the L&SWR system on <b>inspections</b> <b>and</b> <b>visits.</b>|$|E

The path-planning problem is the optimization problem of finding <b>inspection</b> clusters <b>and</b> the <b>visiting</b> sequence of cameras to minimize the overall working time. A unified method is newly proposed to determine the <b>inspection</b> clusters <b>and</b> <b>visiting</b> sequence simultaneously.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringHani G. MelhemThe Abilene & Smoky Valley Railroad Association offers train {{excursions}} to sightseers {{wishing to}} see historic Abilene and natural Kansas scenery. Currently, a diesel powered ALCO locomotive {{is used to}} pull the passenger cars. They wish to use a 1919 Baldwin steam locomotive in the future. Part of the excursion includes a slow crossing of the Smoky Hill River over a two-span steel truss bridge. The company approached the Kansas State University Civil Engineering Department {{with the task of}} performing a structural check of the bridge. By using the Baldwin locomotive, the bridge is required to support much larger loads than when the diesel engine is used. First, a basic visual <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> site <b>visit</b> of the bridge was performed. The inspection was not thorough, but was used to familiarize the team with the bridge and its components. Using the <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> data supplied, a structural analysis was performed using the software, RISA. After completion of the analysis for both loading situations, the resulting stress increases were calculated. Other calculations performed include buckling loads of the compression members, deflections of the bottom chord and stresses in some of the connections. After completion of the analysis and calculations, large increases in member stress were found. For most of the members, the increase of live loads stress was between 80 % and 100 %. The largest stress found due to the dead and live load, which was under 15 ksi, occurred in the bottom chord for the steam locomotive loading situation. Some truss members experienced stress reversal, but relatively low values were noted. Deflection calculations for the two loading situations yielded similar results to the stress calculations. Again, an increase in deflection between 80 % and 100 % was found for the joints located on the bottom chord. It is recommended that a more detailed <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> a more thorough analysis of the connections, supports, piers, and foundations be performed before the heavier locomotive is used...|$|R

40|$|In this research, a risk-based {{shutdown}} <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> {{maintenance interval}} optimization for a processing facility is proposed. Often <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance activities can’t be performed until the processing unit or plant is taken into a non-operational state, generally known as “shutdown”. Extensive work on <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance interval estimation modeling {{is available in}} the concerned literature however, no to very limited application on shutdown <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance modeling is observed for a continuous operating facility. Majority of the published literature deals to optimize individual equipment <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance interval without considering the overall impact of plant unavailability due to shutdown. They all deal to optimize individual equipment <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance interval considering cost, risk, availability and reliability. The efforts towards finding an optimal <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance interval is not considered in these studies especially when it requires unit or plant to be in shutdown state from an operational state for performing <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance. This topic is selected to bridge the existing gap in the available literature and to provide a means to develop a methodology to estimate the shutdown <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance interval for a continuous processing unit or plant, rather an <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance interval for each piece of equipment considering the overall asset availability, reliability and risk. A component failure due to wear or degradation is a major threat to asset failure in a processing facility. A carefully planned <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance strategy not only mitigate the effects of age-based degradation and reduce the threat of failure but also minimize the risk exposure. Generally failure caused by wear or degradation is modeled as a stochastic process. For an effective <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance strategy, the stochastic nature of failure has to be taken into consideration. The proposed methodology aims to minimize the risk of exposure considering effect of failure on human life, financial investment and environment by optimizing the interval of process unit shutdown. Risk-based shutdown <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance optimization quantifies the risk to which individual equipment are subjected and uses this as a basis for the optimization of a shutdown <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance strategy...|$|R
