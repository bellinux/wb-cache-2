The learning outcome was measured cognitively through academic performance. A quasi pretest–posttest experimental design was employed for this study. A total of 431 high school students from four randomly selected schools {{participated in this study}} where they were randomly assigned to either experimental or control groups based on intact classes. Findings indicate {{a significant difference in the}} performance achievement between the two groups with students performed better using <b>desktop</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>reality.</b> A possible explanation is that the <b>desktop</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> instructional intervention has helped to reduce extraneous cognitive load and engages learners in active processing of instructional material to increase germane cognitive load. A significant interaction effect was found between the learning mode and spatial ability with regard to the performance achievement. Further analysis shows a significant difference in the performance of low spatial ability learners in the experimental and control groups, but no statistically significant difference in the performance of high spatial learners in both groups. The results signify that low spatial ability learners' performance, compared with high spatial ability learners, appeared to be more positively affected by the desktop VR-based learning environment which is supported by the ability-as-compensator hypothesis, and can be explained by the cognitive load theory...|$|E

An experimental teaching programme involving undergraduate architectural students at the University of Luton, in which aspects of compositional theory are explored through the direct creation of architectural form and space in digital formats is described.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a prototype}} development project {{to design and}} implement a <b>Desktop</b> VR (<b>Virtual</b> <b>Reality)</b> framework for generating and evaluating Pareto-optimal alternate 3 D spatial configurations using GA (genetic algorithms). The lack of standard procedures to facilitate the coherent and comprehensive planning of spatial configurations hinders the optimal exploitation of valuable interior spaces. This research puts forth a multi-objective optimization methodology for creating alternative interior space configuration scenarios and provides a visual means for assessing the desktop VR-based Pareto-optimal solutions. The search spaces (function domains) are extremely large in these design problems, and the optimization procedure involves conflicting objective functions, and limitations {{in the form of}} constraint functions. This research proposes a <b>Desktop</b> VR (<b>Virtual</b> <b>Reality)</b> framework for generating and evaluating optimal alternate 3 D spatial configurations using GA (genetic algorithms). Based on the extensive literature review conducted for this study, no such earlier research integrating MOGA (Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm) with Desktop VR for solving interior spatial configuration problems could be found. Normally, when employing genetic algorithms (GA) for multiobjective optimization, a group of Pareto-optimal solutions (Pareto set) are available for the planners and decision-makers, wherefrom one solution ought to be picked. Therefore, this study applies a tool to not only visually evaluate the plans, but also to interact with those plans to develop them further if needed. GA formulation involves defining the objective functions/constraints, and also includes defining the GA coding (integer), fitness function, and setting the parameters including mutation rate, crossover type and rate, number of generations etc. Subsequently, the virtual world scenarios corresponding to the Pareto-optimal plans are generated. The subsequent step involves the computer graphics (CG) component wherein genotype-compatible 3 D software objects are rendered. Besides enabling the optimal spatial configuration of the scene elements, this framework also facilitates evaluation and interaction via the 3 D VR worlds. Also, where appropriate, the framework aids the proactive exploration, analysis, and finalization of design aspects such as color, size, lighting, etc. of the various elements prior to the actual construction. This serves as a generic framework that can be extended to other CG domains as well. ...|$|R
