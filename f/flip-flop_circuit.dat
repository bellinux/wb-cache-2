40|$|The {{effect of}} aging {{has become an}} {{important}} reliability concern in Silicon MOSFET technology today. In-order to satisfy Moore???s law and continue scaling towards smaller and higher performance circuits, high-K NMOS devices has replaced conventional silicon in fabrication. With the introduction of high-K metal gate, Bias Temperature Instability is graver than ever before. NBTI (Negative Bias Temperature Instability) which subsequently affects PMOS brings about {{an increase in the}} threshold voltage while PBTI (Positive Bias Temperature Instability), which affects High-K NMOS devices, decreases the threshold voltage of the device. <b>Flip-flop</b> <b>circuits</b> form an integral part as storage elements in today???s pipelined architecture. These devices can easily get affected by such aging and thereby causing timing violations. It is the timing characteristics of the Flip-Flop that usually determine the frequency of operation of the circuit.

We investigated the neutron energy dependence of the single-event-upset (SEU) cross section in embedded SRAMs and <b>flip-flop</b> <b>circuits</b> by using the quasi-monoenergetic neutron beam, and demonstrated {{the characteristics of the}} logic device soft error. We performed an irradiation test using the quasi-monoenergetic neutron beam at the Research Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP) at Osaka University. The neutron beam was produced by the 7 Li(p,n) 7 Be reaction. The energies of the neutron beam used in this experiment were 14, 26, 62, 98, 148 and 198 MeV.

40|$|Abstract — A {{significant}} amount of the total power in highly synchronous systems gets dissipated over clock networks. Therefore, low-power clocking schemes would be promising approaches for high performance designs. To reduce the power consumption and delay, a new <b>flip-flop</b> <b>circuit</b> technique has been designed in CMOS domino logic. These flip-flops are a class of dynamic circuit that can be interfaced with both static and dynamic circuits. This flip-flop results in significant energy savings and operates in high speed. Based on simulation results of UMC 180 nm technology and 200 MHz frequency, we have simulated the <b>flip-flop</b> <b>circuit</b> and compared the result with the previous proposed flip-flops simulated with the same environment. The comparison results of the proposed flip-flop with the previous proposed flip-flop shows that the proposed circuit reduces 80 % of power consumption and the speed increases to 70 - 90 %.

40|$|A simple {{discrete}} planar dynamical {{model for}} the ideal (logical) R-S <b>flip-flop</b> <b>circuit</b> is developed {{with an eye toward}} mimicking the dynamical behavior observed for actual physical realizations of this circuit. It is shown that the model exhibits most of the qualitative features ascribed to the R-S <b>flip-flop</b> <b>circuit,</b> such as an intrinsic instability associated with unit set and reset inputs, manifested in a chaotic sequence of output states that tend to oscillate among all possible output states, and the existence of periodic orbits of arbitrarily high period that depend on the various intrinsic system parameters. The investigation involves a combination of analytical methods from the modern theory of discrete dynamical systems, and numerical simulations that illustrate the dazzling array of dynamics that can be generated by the model. Validation of the discrete model is accomplished by comparison with certain Poincaré map like representations of the dynamics corresponding to three-dimensional differential equation models of electrical circuits that produce R-S flip-flop behavior.

40|$|The {{theory of}} small signal linear {{junction}} transistor amplifiers is extended to develop design techniques {{which can be}} applied to the non-linear problems of switching circuit design. Many of these techniques differ materially from the corresponding techniques of vacuum tube amplifier design. The linear theory is oriented toward the study of moderate-gain wide-band amplifiers driving non-inductive loads and being driven from non-inductive sources since switching circuit amplifiers commonly fall into this category, but many of the concepts have application to other amplifiers as well. As outgrowth of the linear theory, the transistor parameters which are important in flip-flop operation are discussed, and a new way to measure these parameters is described.
