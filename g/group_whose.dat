This gives simple explicit examples of self-similar <b>groups,</b> <b>whose</b> graphs Γ_n form an expanding family, and examples of automaton <b>groups,</b> <b>whose</b> graphs Γ_n have linear diameters diam(Γ_n) =O(n) and bounded girth.

40|$|The limited {{literature}} on mood and group creativity provides inconclusive results.

Members of three-person groups had positive, neutral, or negative moods induced, performed an unusual uses creativity task, and then answered questions regarding their interaction and performance. <b>Groups</b> <b>whose</b> members were in negative moods often demonstrated more positive group processes (e. g., greater persistence, less distraction) than <b>groups</b> <b>whose</b> members were in neutral moods.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the name of the Qedarites is derived from the name for Ishamel's second son Qedar.

5|$|Traditionally, {{from the}} 1940s, {{lanthanum}} {{has been placed}} under scandium and yttrium in group 3 of the periodic table, as its differentiating electron from the previous element goes into a d-orbital. This results in a consistent set of electron configurations in group 3 (Sc: 3d14s2; Y: 4d15s2; La: 5d16s2). However, this position has sometimes been disputed, {{on the grounds that}} yttrium {{and to a lesser extent}} scandium are closer in their chemical properties to lutetium than lanthanum. Indeed, early techniques on separating the rare earths relied on the distinction between the early lanthanides in the cerium <b>group</b> (<b>whose</b> sodium double sulfates dissolve in water with difficulty) and the late ones (as well as yttrium) in the yttrium <b>group</b> (<b>whose</b> sodium double sulfates are very water-soluble), prompting some researchers in the 1920s and 1930s to place lutetium under yttrium instead. Since the differentiating electron between ytterbium and lutetium also goes into a d-orbital, both lutetium and lanthanum appear by this argument as equally valid candidates for being the third member of group 3.|$|E

5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} <b>group</b> <b>whose</b> experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E
5|$|In mid-May 1940, {{eight months}} after the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Browning, promoted to brigadier, was given command of the 128th (Hampshire) Infantry Brigade (consisting of three battalions, the 1/4th, 2/4th and 5th, of the Hampshire Regiment). Part of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, then commanded by Major-General Robert Pollok, the brigade was a Territorial Army unit that was preparing to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. This was pre-empted by the Dunkirk evacuation and the subsequent fall of France in June, and the division assumed a defensive posture. In February 1941, handing over the brigade to Brigadier M. A. James, Browning took command of the 24th Guards Brigade <b>Group,</b> <b>whose</b> objective was to defend London from an attack from the south.|$|E

5|$|Alberta's second dynasty was the United Farmers of Alberta, a farmers' {{movement}} organization, {{formed in}} 1909 as a lobby <b>group,</b> <b>whose</b> political wing rose from a minor party named the Alberta Non-Partisan League, formed in 1916. Henry Wise Wood led the {{party at the}} time of the 1921 election, although he did not run himself. The loosely organized farmer candidates running in rural constituencies captured a majority of the seats. The party was allied with Labour candidates, so it did not contest urban ridings, aside from one in Edmonton. Wood did not want the job as premier so the farmers were forced to shop around. UFA lawyer John Brownlee was asked first but declined. UFA executive member Herbert Greenfield, the second choice, became the new premier, although he too had not run in the election so had to await success in a by-election to take his seat.|$|E
