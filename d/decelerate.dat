5|$|In 1914, Franck {{teamed up}} with Hertz to perform an {{experiment}} to investigate fluorescence. They designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapour of mercury atoms. They discovered that when an electron collided with a mercury atom it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9electron volts) of its kinetic energy before flying away. A faster electron does not <b>decelerate</b> completely after a collision, but loses precisely {{the same amount of}} its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.|$|E

His album sales continued to <b>decelerate</b> with his 2003 album, Ghetto, Gutter & Gangsta, which was released through Bungalo Records. In 2005, he released Hustla's Handbook under Capitol Records. The album did {{significantly better than}} his previous, peaking at number sixty-five on the Billboard 200—forty places above Ghetto, Gutter & Gangsta. His most recent solo album, Soft White (2009), was released through Fontana Distribution and at number 141, it is his lowest charting album on the Billboard 200.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the center of}} mass height is behind or below the line, such as on most tandem {{bicycles}} or long-wheel-base recumbent bicycles, as well as cars, it is less likely that the front wheel can generate enough braking force to flip the bike. This means they can <b>decelerate</b> up to nearly the limit of adhesion of the tires to the road, which could reach 0.8 g if the coefficient of friction is 0.8, which is 40% more than an upright bicycle under even the best conditions. Bicycling Science author David Gordon Wilson points out that this puts upright bicyclists at particular risk of causing a rear-end collision if they tailgate cars.|$|E

40|$|Historically, the {{elective}} intraoperative ventilatory flow {{in small}} infants has been <b>decelerating</b> flow (DF) [1, 2]. This {{was due to}} because the traditional thinking that a <b>decelerating</b> flow waveform (inherent to pressure control ventilation, PCV) improves oxygenation compared with the square flow waveform (common in volume control ventilation, VCV) related to a better intrapulmonary gas distribution. However, the superiority of <b>decelerating</b> flow compared with square flow {{has not yet been}} demonstrated during ventilation in small infants. Even in adults, the su-periority has been questioned in clinical studies showing contradictory results [3 - 10]. Most studies [3 - 6] used VCV and PCV modes when comparing square vs. <b>decelerating</b> flow waveforms in terms of oxygenation and ventilation. However different VT between both modes could affect gas exchange. I...|$|R
5|$|The {{embryonic}} heart begins beating {{at around}} 22 days after conception (5 {{weeks after the}} last normal menstrual period, LMP). It starts to beat at a rate near to the mother's which is about 75–80 beats per minute (bpm). The embryonic heart rate then accelerates and reaches a peak rate of 165–185 bpm early in the early 7th week (early 9th week after the LMP). After 9 weeks (start of the fetal stage) it starts to <b>decelerate,</b> slowing to around 145 (±25) bpm at birth. There is no difference in female and male heart rates before birth.|$|E
5|$|With a VFD, the {{stopping}} {{sequence is}} just the opposite as the starting sequence. The frequency and voltage applied to the motor are ramped down at a controlled rate. When the frequency approaches zero, the motor is shut off. A small amount of braking torque is available to help <b>decelerate</b> the load a little faster than it would stop if the motor were simply switched off and allowed to coast. Additional braking torque {{can be obtained by}} adding a braking circuit (resistor controlled by a transistor) to dissipate the braking energy. With a four-quadrant rectifier (active front-end), the VFD is able to brake the load by applying a reverse torque and injecting the energy back to the AC line.|$|E
5|$|According to Caltrain, the {{electrification}} {{project will}} bring multiple {{benefits to the}} corridor. Firstly, electric trains can accelerate and <b>decelerate</b> more quickly than the existing diesel locomotives, resulting in faster and more frequent service. They will also replace Caltrain's current diesel locomotives and passenger cars, {{a significant portion of}} which are nearing the end of their lives. Additionally, electric trainsets are quieter and produce less air pollution that diesel locomotives, and the use of electric trains will lower Caltrain's fuel costs while increasing passenger revenue, due to an expected increase in ridership. Once complete, Caltrain expects to annually reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 176,000 metric tons and increase daily ridership by 21% by 2040. Daily service may be restored to Atherton and Broadway stations. Caltrain plans to complete the project by the end of 2021.|$|E

A vacuum system and an electron beam ionization source was constructed. Supporting electronics for a residual gas analyzer were built.

5|$|As the eye moved onshore in Florida, the {{convection}} in the eyewall strengthened due {{to increased}} convergence, and Hurricane Hunters reported a warmer eyewall temperature than two hours prior. However, Andrew weakened as it continued further inland, and after crossing southern Florida in four hours, the storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico with winds of 130 mph (210 km/h). In the Gulf of Mexico, the eye remained well-defined as the hurricane turned to the west-northwest, a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north. Andrew steadily re-intensified over the Gulf of Mexico, reaching winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) late on August 25. As the high pressure system to its north weakened, a strong mid-latitude trough approached the area from the northwest. This caused the hurricane to <b>decelerate</b> to the northwest, and winds decreased as Andrew approached the Gulf Coast of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Ella {{intensified}} {{quickly and}} reached hurricane status late on August31, based on confirmation from nearby ship reports and a Hurricane Hunters flight. At the time, the hurricane was forecast {{to avoid making}} landfall on North Carolina and ultimately turn northeastward, although it was expected to pass within 50miles (85km) of land during the busy Labor Day Weekend. On September1, Ella reached a preliminary peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), a major hurricane and a Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. At {{the same time a}} short-wave trough reached the East Coast of the United States. The trough caused the hurricane to <b>decelerate</b> and turn slightly to the north, and a ridge behind the trough caused Ella to become nearly stationary for 24hours. During that time, the threat toward the North Carolina coast diminished, and concurrently, the winds decreased as the convection diminished.|$|E
5|$|Within 12 {{hours of}} forming, the {{depression}} intensified into Tropical Storm Fernanda. Banding features increased, and outflow became well-established throughout the storm. Fernanda intensified further and attained hurricane status late on August 10. Soon after, a large eye became evident on satellite imagery, which became more distinct and organized. The hurricane subsequently underwent rapid intensification, and by August 12, Fernanda reached peak winds of 145mph (230km/h); at that time, {{it was a}} Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and was located about 1070 miles (1725km) southwest of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The peak winds were based on estimates from the Dvorak technique. After maintaining peak winds for about 18 hours, the hurricane began a slow weakening trend. By August 14, the eye had become less distinct as the storm moved over cooler waters, while winds decreased to below major hurricane status, or Category 3 intensity. At that time, the NHC forecast Fernanda to <b>decelerate</b> and turn to the northwest, although the possibility of a more westward track toward Hawaii was noted.|$|E
