5000|$|The {{reason for}} his {{retirement}} to Auriol is not far to seek. The plague was raging in southern France again in 1361 and 1362.

5|$|Aldfrith {{was said}} to have been ill for some time before his death, <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> 14 December 704 or 705. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle adds that he died at Driffield in the East Riding of Yorkshire. The {{succession}} was disputed by Eadwulf, supported initially by Bishop Wilfrid, and supporters of Aldfrith's young son Osred, apparently led by Berht's kinsman Berhtfrith.|$|E
5|$|Atherton went to {{work for}} the Saskatchewan Transportation Company and settled in Saskatoon. Pepler retired in 1954, having served 20years as British Columbia's deputy {{attorney}} general. He subsequently served as one of British Columbia's commissioners on uniform provincial laws and embarked on a revision of the rules of the British Columbia Supreme Court before <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> November 16, 1957, at age 66 in a suburban Vancouver hospital.|$|E
5|$|Belcourt {{remained}} {{pastor of}} his parish at Rustico until 1869, when he retired. The priest intended {{to live on}} a farm at Shediac, New Brunswick, but was called back to the church in August 1871. He was asked to pastor a parish on the Magdalen Islands. Ill health forced his retirement from there in May 1874, and he returned to Shediac before <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> May 31, 1874.|$|E

5|$|Garfield lingered for two-and-a-half {{months before}} <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> September 19, 1881. Vice President Chester A. Arthur, the New York Stalwart, {{was sworn in}} as {{president}} that night. Garfield's murder by a spoilsman inspired the nation to reform the civil service—and Arthur, erstwhile member of the Conkling machine, joined the cause. In 1883, a bipartisan majority in Congress passed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act to reform the worst of the office-seeking system, and Arthur signed the measure into law.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, Lumsden {{was awarded}} a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath and was {{appointed}} as a commissioner on the Council of India for 10 years. He represented Britain a year later at the Anglo-Russian Commission for the demarcation of the north-west boundary of Afghanistan, then acted as British representative on the Afghan Frontier Commission. After retiring from military service in 1893, Lumsden served as a {{justice of the peace}} in his home county of Aberdeenshire, before <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> his 89th birthday, 9 November 1918, in Dufftown, Banffshire.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the executions, there was speculation that up to 27 more prisoners could face the death penalty. Ultimately, these predictions proved ill-founded. Franco fell ill in late October 1975 and never recovered, <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> 20 November 1975. His death resulted in the de facto abolition of the death penalty, as no further executions took place. Capital punishment was abolished for all civil crimes by the Spanish Constitution of 1978, with sanctioned military executions in war time the sole exceptions. In 1995, the Spanish parliament abolished the death penalty in all circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Lord Granville died {{in early}} 1846, having never {{recovered}} from a stroke he suffered five years previously. He was buried at Stone, Staffordshire. His death desolated his wife. She lived henceforth in complete retirement, residing chiefly at Chiswick House, where she turned to piety for consolation. Her contacts {{in the outside world}} were chiefly her children and step-children, her brother William, and the children of her sister Georgiana. She survived her husband by fifteen years, <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> 25 November 1862 of a stroke at her London home at 13 Hereford Street.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe's last public {{appearance}} was in 2009, at {{the unveiling of}} a bust of himself in the Grimond Room at the House of Commons. Thereafter he was confined to his home, nursed by Marion until she became too infirm. She died on 6 March 2014; Thorpe survived her for nine months, <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> 4 December. At his funeral, at St Margaret's, Westminster on 17 December, the mourners were led by five of his successors to the Liberal/Liberal Democrat leadership: Steel, Paddy Ashdown, Charles Kennedy, Menzies Campbell and Nick Clegg.|$|E
5|$|Bean {{starred in}} the espionage {{television}} series Legends as Martin Odum, an FBI agent who takes on various fabricated identities to go undercover. The show was cancelled after its second season. An intensive viral marketing campaign was centred on the hashtag #DontKillSeanBean, focusing on the various deaths of his past characters and promising his character in Legends would not suffer the same fate. The campaign culminated with a Funny or Die exclusive video featuring Bean filming a scene for the show where he's become so accustomed to <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> screen that he expects his character to die a bizarrely gruesome death despite {{the simplicity of the}} scene.|$|E

5|$|Cope {{had little}} formal {{scientific}} training, and he eschewed a teaching position for field work. He made regular {{trips to the}} American West, prospecting in the 1870s and 1880s, often {{as a member of}} United States Geological Survey teams. A personal feud between Cope and paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh led to a period of intense fossil-finding competition now known as the Bone Wars. Cope's financial fortunes soured after failed mining ventures in the 1880s, forcing him to sell off much of his fossil collection. He experienced a resurgence in his career {{toward the end of his}} life before <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> April 12, 1897.|$|E
5|$|For its part, the Polish army marched {{across the}} Dniester into Moldavia in August 1497. The Sultan sent 500 or 600 Janissaries to Moldavia at Stephen's request, joining the Moldavian forces {{gathered}} at Roman. Stephen sent his chancellor, Isaac, to John Albert, requesting {{the withdrawal of}} Polish forces from Moldavia, but John Albert had Isaac imprisoned. The Poles then laid siege to Suceava on 24 September. The campaign failed: Teutonic reinforcements never arrived, with Johann von Tiefen <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> the way. Before long, a plague {{broke out in the}} Polish camp, while Vladislaus of Hungary sent an army of 12,000 strong to Moldavia, forcing John Albert to lift the siege on 19 October.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Hastings {{published}} his autobiography, simply titled The Autobiography of Sir Patrick Hastings, {{and the following}} year published Cases in Court, a book giving his views on 21 of his most noted cases. The same year he published Famous and Infamous Cases, a book on noted trials through history, such as those at Nuremberg. In early 1948, he suffered a small stroke which forced him to retire permanently from work as a barrister. On 11 November 1949, {{he and his wife}} travelled to Kenya, where their son Nicky had moved {{to start a new life}} after the end of the Second World War. While there, he suffered a second stroke due to the air pressure, and he never fully recovered. Hastings spent the next two years of his life living in a flat in London, before <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> 26 February 1952 of cerebral thrombosis.|$|E

5|$|The Talara Tar Seeps in Peru {{represent}} a similar scenario, and have also produced fossils of Smilodon. Unlike in La Brea, {{many of the}} bones were broken or show signs of weathering. This may have been because the layers were shallower, so the thrashing of trapped animals damaged the bones of previously trapped animals. Many of the carnivores at Talara were juveniles, possibly indicating that inexperienced and less fit animals had a greater chance of being trapped. Though Lund thought accumulations of Smilodon and herbivore fossils in the Lagoa Santa Caves were due to the cats using the caves as dens, these {{are probably the result}} of animals <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> the surface, and water currents subsequently dragging their bones {{to the floor of the}} cave, but some individuals may also have died after becoming lost in the caves.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} between Paul Brown and Modell reached a breaking point when Brown traded star halfback Bobby Mitchell {{for the rights}} to Ernie Davis, a Heisman Trophy-winning running back who broke all of Jim Brown's rushing records at Syracuse. Paul Brown did not inform Modell of the move, and Modell only heard about it after getting a call from Washington Redskins owner George Preston Marshall. Davis, however, was diagnosed with leukemia before the 1962 season. He came to Cleveland to train after the cancer went into remission, but Brown would not allow him to play. Modell, however, wanted to give Davis a chance to play before he succumbed to the disease. Ultimately, the relationship between coach and owner was never repaired, and Ernie Davis never played in a professional game, <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> May 18, 1963.|$|E
5|$|There may {{nonetheless}} be {{a connection}} between the murder of Eadulf and events further south. For the same year the Chronicle of John of Worcester related that, because of an attack on two of Harthacnut's tax-collectors there, Siward took part in a reprisal on the city and monastery of Worcester. Harthacnut reigned only another year, <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> 8 June 1042. He was succeeded by the exiled English ætheling Edward. As an ætheling, a royal prince with a present or likely future claim on the throne, Edward appears to have been invited back by Harthacnut in 1041, fortuitously smoothing over the coming change in ruler. Edward was crowned king on Easter Day, 3 April 1043.|$|E
