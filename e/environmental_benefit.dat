25|$|In {{conservation}} and energy economics, the rebound effect (or take-back effect, RE) is {{the reduction in}} expected gains from new technologies that increase the efficiency of resource use, because of behavioral or other systemic responses. These responses usually tend to offset the beneficial effects of the new technology or other measures taken. While {{the literature on the}} rebound effect generally focuses on the effect of technological improvements on energy consumption, the theory can also be applied to the use of any natural resource or other input, such as labor. The rebound effect is generally expressed as a ratio of the lost benefit compared to the expected <b>environmental</b> <b>benefit</b> when holding consumption constant.|$|E
25|$|Producing rice in paddies {{is harmful}} for the {{environment}} due {{to the release of}} methane by methanogenic bacteria. These bacteria live in the anaerobic waterlogged soil, and live off nutrients released by rice roots. Researchers have recently reported in Nature that putting the barley gene SUSIBA2 into rice creates a shift in biomass production from root to shoot (above ground tissue becomes larger, while below ground tissue is reduced), decreasing the methanogen population, and resulting in a reduction of methane emissions of up to 97%. Apart from this <b>environmental</b> <b>benefit,</b> the modification also increases the amount of rice grains by 43%, which makes it a useful tool in feeding a growing world population.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{important}} for any carbon credit (offset) to prove a concept called additionality. The concept of additionality addresses {{the question of whether}} the project would have happened in the absence of an intervention in the form of the price signal of carbon credits. Only projects with emissions below their baseline level, defined as emissions under a scenario without this price signal (holding all other factors constant), represent a net <b>environmental</b> <b>benefit.</b> Carbon projects that yield strong financial returns even in the absence of revenue from carbon credits; or that are compelled by regulations; or that represent common practice in an industry; are usually not considered additional. A full determination of additionality requires a careful investigation of proposed carbon offset projects.|$|E

2500|$|A 2004 {{study from}} Lancaster University {{concluded}} that there was no <b>environmental</b> <b>benefit</b> to be gained from persuading car or plane travelers to switch to trains. Environmental group Friends of the Earth were skeptical of the findings, claiming the results are not in line with previous studies. [...] The study showed that trains had failed {{to keep up with the}} advances that the automotive and aviation industries had made in improved fuel efficiency. [...] Express trains travelling from London to Edinburgh consumed 11.5 litres more fuel per seat than a modern diesel car.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{because the}} law allows private {{citizens}} to sue and collect damages from any business violating the law, there have been cases of lawyers and law firms using Proposition 65 to force monetary settlements out of California businesses. The Attorney General's office has cited several instances of settlements where plaintiff attorneys received significant awards without providing for <b>environmental</b> <b>benefit</b> {{to the people of}} California, resulting in the requirement of the Attorney General's approval of pre-trial Proposition 65 settlements. [...] The Attorney General also objected to efforts in settlements between private parties to pre-empt the Attorney General's right and duty to protect the public interest against future violations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{summarizes}} methods, data, {{and results}} {{associated with the}} first major attempt to evaluate the <b>environmental</b> <b>benefits</b> of FEMA natural hazards mitigation grants. The study relied heavily on the refinement of benefit transfer methods. Categories of benefits include water quality for recreational and commercial fishing, drinking water, outdoor recreation, hazardous waste, wetlands and aesthetic, health and safety <b>benefits.</b> <b>Environmental</b> and historic <b>benefits</b> {{proved to be a}} very minor proportion of the total benefits in dollar terms. Only {{a very small percentage of}} earthquake and wind-related hazards yielded <b>environmental</b> <b>benefits,</b> while a sizeable percentage of flood hazard grants did so. We also discuss the prospects that <b>environmental</b> <b>benefits</b> might have been much greater had data been available to analyze more environmental impacts...|$|R

The UCS found that, compared to its closest conventional counterpart the Toyota Matrix, the Prius emits 44% less global warming pollution. [...] The Prius score on forced features was rated relatively good, as the car came with [...] worth of forced features. For the 2010 Hybrid Scorecard the evaluation found that the worst offender was the luxury Lexus LS 600h L hybrid which came with more than [...] in forced features compared with the conventional, base model Lexus LS 460L. The 2010 Scorecard was updated on April 2010 to include new hybrids that have been launched in the U.S. market such as the Mercedes-Benz S400 and the BMW ActiveHybrid X6.|$|E
2500|$|An {{additional}} <b>environmental</b> <b>benefit</b> {{of greens}} roofs {{is the ability}} to sequester carbon. Carbon is the main component of plant matter and is naturally absorbed by plant tissue. The carbon is stored in the plant tissue and the soil substrate through plant litter and root exudates. A study on green roofs in Michigan and Maryland found the above ground biomass and below ground substrate stored on average between 168 g C m−2 and 107 g C m−2 [...] Variations occurred among the different species of plant used. [...] Substrate carbon content averaged 913 g C m−2 and after the subtraction of the original carbon content the total sequestration was 378 g C m−2. The sequestration can be improved by changing plant species, increasing substrate depth, substrate composition, and management practices. In a study done in Michigan above ground sequestration ranged from 64 g C m−2 to 239 g C m−2 for S. acre and S album. Also, by increasing the substrate depth would allow for more area of carbon storage and diversify the types of plants with greater potential of carbon storage. The direct carbon sequestration techniques and methods can be measured and accounted for. Green roofs also indirectly reduce CO2 given off by power plants through their ability to insulate buildings. Buildings in the US account for 38% of the total carbon dioxide emissions. A model supported by the U.S. Department of Energy found a 2 percent reduction in electricity consumption and 9-11% reduction in natural gas when implementing green roofs.|$|E
