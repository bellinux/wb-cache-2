40|$|The {{segmentation}} of {{the academic}} labor market into primary and secondary sectors is historically situated and described. The market experiences of recent Ph. D. s in selected humanities and social science disciplines illustrate the segmentation process. A consequence of placement in a secondary market may be academic underemployment. ^ A structural model of academic market placement is developed {{as an alternative to}} a meritocratic model of job placement. Rather than focusing exclusively on the characteristics of individual workers, a structural model of market placement looks first at demographic features (such as race or sex) predisposing movement into a secondary sector. Once entering the secondary sector, characteristics of that market militate against mobility into a primary sector. Characteristics of a secondary labor market in academia include not having access to tenure or to institutional resources, and increased geographical mobility by virtue of the temporary nature of employment. ^ The central thesis, that academics laboring in a secondary market are at greater risk of <b>invisible</b> <b>underemployment,</b> is supported by the data. <b>Invisible</b> <b>underemployment</b> is measured by low income relative to Ph. D. s in a primary sector, by job 2 ̆ 2 mismatch 2 ̆ 2 (perceived relationship between current job and educational training) and underemployment consciousness. Quantitative measures of underemployment are supplemented by qualitative data on job search experiences of recent Ph. D. s by market placement, and individual and organized responses to underemployment. ^ Finally, current policies on Ph. D. oversupply and institutional responses to oversupply are discussed. Speculation on {{the findings of this study}} gives rise to directions for future research. ...|$|E
40|$|The study {{explores the}} {{correlates}} of various modes of labor force participation by estimating probabilities of unemployment, visible and <b>invisible</b> <b>underemployment,</b> and full employment for individuals, given their socioeconomic characteristics and wage offers in each mode. The {{results show that}} (i) single females tend to have higher probabilities of being employed than single males, although once employed have a greater tendency towards underemployment; (ii) married males {{are less likely to}} be unemployed and more likely to be invisibly underemployed or fully employed than non-married males; (ii) married women {{are less likely to be}} unemployed compared with single women, although they are also likely to be underemployed; and (iv) the likelihoo of being unemployed is increased for every year of high school and college education. These results provide a baseline by which the impact of macroeconomic adjustment may be evaluated in terms of its employment effects on various social groups...|$|E
