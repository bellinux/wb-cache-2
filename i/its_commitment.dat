5|$|After {{conducting}} a criminal investigation, verifying that Germany would honor its military alliance, and persuading the skeptical Hungarian Count Tisza, Austria-Hungary issued a formal {{letter to the}} government of Serbia. The letter reminded Serbia of <b>its</b> <b>commitment</b> to respect the Great Powers' decision regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to maintain good neighborly relations with Austria-Hungary. The letter contained specific demands aimed at preventing the publication of propaganda advocating the violent destruction of Austria-Hungary, removing the people behind this propaganda from the Serbian Military, arresting the people on Serbian soil {{who were involved in the}} assassination plot and preventing the clandestine shipment of arms and explosives from Serbia to Austria-Hungary.|$|E
5|$|American missionaries were {{threatened}} with death when the Boxer Rebellion menaced foreigners in China. Americans and other westerners in Peking were besieged and, {{in cooperation with}} other western powers, McKinley ordered 5000 troops to the city in June 1900 in the China Relief Expedition. The westerners were rescued the next month, but several Congressional Democrats objected to McKinley dispatching troops without consulting the legislature. McKinley's actions set a precedent that led to most of his successors exerting similar independent control over the military. After the rebellion ended, the United States reaffirmed <b>its</b> <b>commitment</b> to the Open Door policy, which became the basis of American policy toward China.|$|E

5|$|Both the United States and Australia {{cited the}} {{alliance}} as justification for involvement in Vietnam. U.S. membership in SEATO provided the United States with {{a rationale for}} a large-scale U.S. military intervention in Southeast Asia. Other countries, such as the UK and key nations in Asia, accepted the rationale. In 1962, as part of <b>its</b> <b>commitment</b> to SEATO, the Royal Australian Air Force deployed CAC Sabres of its No. 79 Squadron to Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. The Sabres began {{to play a role}} in the Vietnam War in 1965, when their air defence responsibilities expanded to include protection of USAF aircraft using Ubon as a base for strikes against North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen is {{recognized}} as one of the most environmentally friendly cities in the world. As a result of <b>its</b> <b>commitment</b> to high environmental standards, Copenhagen has been praised for its green economy, ranked as the top green city for the second time in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index (GGEI). In 2001 a large offshore wind farm was built just off the coast of Copenhagen at Middelgrunden. It produces about 4% of the city's energy. Years of substantial investment in sewage treatment have improved water quality in the harbour to an extent that the inner harbour can be used for swimming with facilities at a number of locations.|$|E
5|$|In December 1969 B Squadron was re-designated A Squadron, {{while in}} December 1970 A Squadron was in turn re-designated C Squadron. By late-1970 Australia was {{beginning}} to reduce <b>its</b> <b>commitment</b> to {{the war and the}} size of 1ATF was again reduced from three infantry battalions to two. The tanks, however, continued operations and were involved in heavy fighting at Long Khanh on 6–7 June 1971, as well as numerous smaller actions. The last elements of the regiment were subsequently withdrawn from Vietnam in September 1971. A total of 58 Centurions had served in Vietnam; 42 had suffered battle damage, of which six were beyond repair, while two crewmen had been killed in action.|$|E

5|$|Britain, with <b>its</b> <b>commitment</b> to South Arabia and {{its base}} in Aden, {{considered}} the Egyptian invasion a real threat. Recognition {{of the republic}} posed a problem to several treaties Britain had signed with the sheiks and sultans of the South Arabian Federation. Saudi Arabia urged the British to identify themselves with the royalists. On the other hand, there were some in the British Foreign Office who believed Britain could buy security for Aden by recognizing the republic. However, Britain eventually decided not to recognize. Iran, Turkey and most of western Europe also withheld recognition. The republic did receive the recognition of West Germany, Italy, Canada and Australia, {{as well as the}} remaining Arab governments, Ethiopia and the entire communist bloc.|$|E

5|$|Developed in the 2000s at an {{investment}} of US$2 million after IDF commitments for 1,200 units, some AIL jobs {{were believed to be}} in jeopardy following a mid-2005 announcement that the IDF would purchase 100 US sold Land Rover Defender-based MDT David. The announcement provoked threats of protests from AIL's management and labourers, who had recently faced the blow of local Humvee assembly ceasing due to budget considerations. The MDT David was chosen over the armoured version of the Storm because the heavy Storm was said to suffer from handling and reliability problems, safety hazards and limited mission operability. However the IDF said that the purchase of the David was to fill a temporary gap in production until the Storm II's testing was completed, and has since begun filling <b>its</b> <b>commitment.</b>|$|E

5|$|Having been {{elevated}} to the peerage as Viscount Bruce of Melbourne by long-time colleague Clement Attlee, {{he would be}} {{an active participant in}} the chamber, attending regularly right up until his death. Bruce used it as a platform to continue to campaign on international and national social and economic questions, and to promote recognition and representation for Australia within the Commonwealth, though by this time Australian and British interests were becoming increasingly far apart, and the British Empire was rapidly disintegrating. He also continued to lobby the British government in these years to increase <b>its</b> <b>commitment</b> to third world development and the FAO. An avid golfer his whole life, Bruce became the first Australian captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 1954. From 1948 to 1952 he was President of Leander Club, while continuing to coach rowing at Cambridge University sporadically, and frequently appeared at public events both in Australia and in England.|$|E
5|$|Hepburn's next feature, Stage Door (1937), paired {{her with}} Ginger Rogers in {{a role that}} {{mirrored}} her own life—that of a wealthy society girl {{trying to make it}} as an actress. Hepburn was praised for her work at early previews, which gave her top billing over Rogers. The film was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, but it was not the box-office hit RKO had hoped for. Industry pundits blamed Hepburn for the small profit, but the studio continued <b>its</b> <b>commitment</b> to resurrecting her popularity. She was cast in Howard Hawks' screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby (1938), where she played a flighty heiress who loses a leopard while trying to woo a palaeontologist (Cary Grant). She approached the physical comedy of the film with confidence, and took tips on comedic timing from her costar Walter Catlett. Bringing Up Baby was acclaimed by critics, but it was nevertheless unsuccessful at the box office. With the genre and Grant both hugely popular at the time, biographer A. Scott Berg believes the blame lay with moviegoers' rejection of Hepburn.|$|E
5|$|In March 1966, the Australian {{government}} further increased <b>its</b> <b>commitment</b> to the Vietnam War, {{announcing the}} deployment of a two-battalion brigade with armour, aviation, engineer and artillery support, designated the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF). Jackson was subsequently appointed as its first commander. Based in Phuoc Tuy Province, South Vietnam, 1 ATF was involved in counter-insurgency operations against the Viet Cong. During his period in command the task force was successfully established at Nui Dat, clearing a security zone around the base and conducting offensive operations {{to the edge of}} the Tactical Area of Responsibility, while a number of significant actions were fought, including the Battle of Long Tan, which established 1 ATF's dominance over the province. Jackson was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his command of 1 ATF during this period.|$|E
5000|$|Typically {{financial}} crises happen {{as a consequence}} of the government’s inability to maintain <b>its</b> <b>commitments,</b> and a benevolent government will compare the benefits and costs of maintaining the original policies. When investors believe the government is unable to honor <b>its</b> <b>commitments,</b> the expectation itself and the following optimal behaviors of the investors, such as stopping purchasing the newly issued government bond or selling the local currency for foreign currency, will increase cost for the government to adhere to the promised policy. When the cost of maintaining the committed policy is very high, the government finds it optimal to abandon the existing policy. Consequently, a crisis happens when government’s inability to maintain the committed policy ends up justifying investors' pessimism.|$|R
