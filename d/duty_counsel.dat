People arrested by police services across the province of Ontario, {{as well as by}} Canada Border Services Agency officers at land, air, and sea ports of entry in Ontario also have the right to contact <b>Duty</b> <b>Counsel.</b> Any person arrested or detained in Canada has the right to speak to a lawyer without delay (with very narrow exceptions), and the police are required to inform them of that right, and facilitate access to a lawyer.

60|$|So far, the {{character}} of Charlotte Stanhope is not unprepossessing. But {{it remains to be}} said that the influence which she had in her family, though it had been used to a certain extent for their worldly well-being, had not been used to their real benefit, as it might have been. She had aided her father in his indifference to his professional <b>duties,</b> <b>counselling</b> him that his livings were as much his individual property as the estates of his elder brother were the property of that worthy peer. She had for years past stifled every little rising wish for a return to England which the doctor had from time to time expressed. She had encouraged her mother in her idleness, in order that she herself might be mistress and manager of the Stanhope household. She had encouraged and fostered the follies of her sister, though she was always willing, and often able, to protect her from their probable result. She had done her best, and had thoroughly succeeded in spoiling her brother, and turning him loose upon the world an idle man without a profession and without a shilling that he could call his own.|$|R

5000|$|Finally, {{the case}} {{involved}} section 10(b), the right [...] "to retain and instruct counsel without delay {{and to be}} informed of that right." [...] The Court noted it had found in R. v. Bartle (1994) that rights to be informed that one may seek counsel included rights to be told of <b>duty</b> <b>counsel</b> and how to obtain it i.e., through a free telephone call. Although Latimer was told that legal aid existed, he was not told {{that he could make}} a free telephone call and obtain advice from <b>duty</b> <b>counsel</b> right away. Latimer argued this contradicted Bartle. However, Saskatchewan happened to have different hours during which one could make a free telephone call to directly obtain <b>duty</b> <b>counsel.</b> The arrest occurred {{at a time when it}} was not available; therefore the right established in Bartle was inapplicable in this case, as it would have been of no use.|$|E

40|$|Real estate conveyances are {{accomplished}} {{differently and}} by different players across Europe. The European Union houses four basic regimes, {{related to the}} classical “legal families”: 1) The Latin-German notary regime, where the public notary plays the central role, 2) the partly deregulated Dutch notary regime, 3) the lawyer/solicitor regime, prevalent on the British Isles, where conveyances are traditionally accomplished by solicitors, and 4) the Nordic regulated real estate broker regime. The comparative {{studies that have been}} conducted with respect to these regimes have focused on the economic impact—with particular regard to transaction costs—of regulation, particularly that concerning the Latin-German notary profession. The studies, while having great merit, are incomplete insofar as they fail to properly take into account, inter alia, the legal framework of the respective regimes and the functions performed by the key players. The present dissertation examines, compares, and analyzes the nature and scope of the non-litigious legal counsel that buyers and sellers of real estate can expect to receive—without hiring lawyers to represent them—under the Latin-German regime and the Swedish regime. To that end, the Swedish real estate broker and the Latin notary are examined and compared with respect to the role they play in real estate conveyances and their <b>duty</b> to give <b>counsel</b> to the contracting parties. The study is conducted in two steps: first a general overview of the professions’ duties and roles, followed by a more detailed juxtaposition of their <b>duty</b> to <b>counsel.</b> The first part comprises Sweden and nine notary regime countries: Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, Portugal Puerto Rico, and Spain. The second part focuses on Sweden and France. The two professions share two main traits: a duty of impartiality and a <b>duty</b> to <b>counsel.</b> The <b>duty</b> to <b>counsel</b> of the Swedish broker and the French notary are strikingly similar and consists in four sub-duties: 1) to conduct verifications to ascertain facts, 2) to disclose relevant information, 3) to give adequate advice, and 4) to draw up all necessary deeds {{in a manner that is}} tailored to the instant transaction. The duty of impartiality and the <b>duty</b> to <b>counsel</b> amount to a specific function in real estate conveyances, common to both professions—namely that of impartial counsel. The desirability of the different regimes can be assessed and discussed from several perspectives, including but not limited to the economic perspective. In general terms, a regime can be said to be desirable if the produced utility exceeds the costs. The question is how to properly measure utility and costs. In limiting studies to such factors as can be readily measured, mainly pecuniary costs, one obtains an incomplete picture since there may be utility and costs that remain unaccounted for. For instance, the extent to which the state should interfere in the marketplace is not merely an economical issue but also an ideological issue. How does one account for ideologically conditioned utility and costs? One way to obtain more solid information is to study the regimes’ institutional robustness; that is, their ability to produce the desired results. For instance, harmful incentives for key players such as brokers and notaries may have an adverse effect on the performance of their assigned functions. Future research should focus on these issues.
