The results will provide new knowledge of the use of references when launching innovations and of how to increase efficiency in sales and marketing as well as in establishing customer relationships.

40|$|Two {{strategies}} {{have largely been}} adopted by the US government to enhance the scientific academic contribution to <b>industrial</b> <b>innovations</b> and growth: financing academic research and granting academic ideas the same intellectual property rights (IPR) as <b>industrial</b> <b>innovations.</b> In distinguishing the stages of R&D within a dynamic general equilibrium model, {{it is found that}} academic government expenditures spur industrial R&D when academia and industry are almost equally efficient in their research capabilities and when firms have a high enough market size. Moreover, it is found that the softer IPR regime granted to academia increases the per capita growth rate of the economy...|$|R
25|$|Massachusetts {{became a}} leader in <b>industrial</b> <b>innovation</b> and {{development}} during the 19th century. Since colonial times, {{there had been a}} successful iron making industry in New England. The first successful ironworks in America was established at Saugus in 1646, utilizing bog iron from swamps to produce plows, nails, firearms, hoops for barrels and other items necessary {{for the development of the}} Colony. Other industries would be established during this period, such as shipbuilding, lumber, paper and furniture making. These small-scale shops and factories often utilized the State's many rivers and streams to power their machinery.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} {{negative}} capability {{can be seen}} at work in <b>industrial</b> <b>innovation.</b> In order to create an innovator's advantage and develop new forms of economic enterprise, the modern industrialist could not just become more efficient with surplus extraction based on pre-existing work roles, but rather needed to invent new styles of flexible labor, expertise, and capital management. The industrialist needed to bring people together in new and innovative ways and redefine work roles and workplace organization. The modern factory had to at once stabilize its productive environment by inventing new restraints upon labor, such as length of the work day and division of tasks, {{but at the same time}} could not be too severe or risk being at a disadvantage to competitors, e.g. not being able to shift production tasks or capacity. Those industrialists and managers who were able to break old forms of organizational arrangements exercised negative capability.|$|E

2500|$|The {{next three}} decades brought {{continued}} growth with many new buildings (see 'Campus' below), and growing ties to industry. The [...] "H-building", previously used for storage, became {{the home for}} the RPI incubator program, the first such program sponsored solely by a university. Shortly after this, RPI decided to invest $3million in pavement, water and power on around [...] of land it owned [...] south of campus to create the Rensselaer Technology Park. In 1982 the New York State legislature granted RPI $30million to build the George M. Low Center for <b>Industrial</b> <b>Innovation,</b> a center for industry-sponsored research and development.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} factor in this industrial boom (as {{in the development of}} the fisheries) was, remarkably, the regulating role of the Dutch government: guaranteeing product quality gave Dutch products a reputation in foreign markets, that justified slightly higher prices, if need be. Other forms of market regulation, like the monopolies given to the VOC and WIC, but also the [...] semi-official industry bodies that regulated the trade on Russia and the Levant, and the [...] herring industry, helped stabilize market fluctuations. Patent protection helped stimulate <b>industrial</b> <b>innovation.</b> The sophisticated Dutch capital market was stabilized by regulated institutions like the Amsterdam Bank and Exchange, and the regulator of the insurance market. And maybe most importantly, the close connection of the Dutch regents to commercial interests in this period helped shield Dutch industry and commerce from excessive taxation or tariffs. Also, the Dutch government did not hesitate to put its not inconsiderable diplomatic and military might behind Dutch commercial interests, if the need arose to protect them against foreign protectionist measures.|$|E
2500|$|Springfield's {{original}} {{name was}} Calhoun, after Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina. The land that Springfield now occupies was originally settled by trappers and traders {{who came to}} the Sangamon River in 1818. The settlement's first cabin was built in 1820, by John Kelly. It was located at what is now the northwest corner of Second Street and Jefferson Street. In 1821, Calhoun became the county seat of Sangamon County due to fertile soil and trading opportunities. Settlers from Kentucky, Virginia, and as far as North Carolina came to the city. By 1832, Senator Calhoun had fallen out of the favor with the public and the town renamed itself Springfield after Springfield, Massachusetts. At that time, Springfield, Massachusetts was comparable to modern-day Silicon Valley—known for <b>industrial</b> <b>innovation,</b> concentrated prosperity, and the celebrated Springfield Armory. Most importantly, it was a city that had built itself up from frontier outpost to national power through ingenuity – an example that the newly named Springfield, Illinois, sought to emulate. Kaskaskia was the first capital of the Illinois Territory from its organization in 1809, continuing through statehood in 1818, and through the first year as a state in 1819. Vandalia was the second state capital of Illinois from 1819 to 1839. Springfield became the third and current capital of Illinois in 1839. The designation was largely due to the efforts of Abraham Lincoln and his associates; nicknamed the [...] "Long Nine" [...] for their combined height of [...]|$|E
