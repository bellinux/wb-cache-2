5|$|Modem Wars, {{released}} in 1988 for <b>DOS</b> <b>and</b> the Commodore 64, {{was the first}} RTS with multiplayer games by means of modems. Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, which allow two gamers to compete by modem or local networks, persuaded a wider audience that multiplayer competition was much more challenging than contests against the artificial intelligence (AI), and made multiplayer facilities essential for future RTS titles.|$|E

Leisure Suit Larry 1: In the Land of the Lounge Lizards used the new game engine Sierra's Creative Interpreter and was released in 1991 for the Amiga, <b>DOS,</b> <b>and</b> Macintosh platforms. For the first remake, Al Lowe served as director and designer, also helping to program the game, and Ken Williams became executive producer. Other key people included Stuart Moulder (producer), William R. Davis Sr. (creative director), William D. Skirvin (art designer), Mark Seibert (music director), Oliver Brelsford (lead programmer), and the music other than the theme song was composed by Chris Braymen.|$|E
5|$|Dark Forces was ported from DOS to Apple Macintosh. This {{presented}} several {{challenges for}} the developers. LucasArts requested the game to be produced for both <b>DOS</b> <b>and</b> Macintosh with the same system requirements, specifically the random-access memory (RAM). The Mac OS runs a graphical user interface which uses up RAM while DOS does not, meaning the Macintosh version has less RAM available for Dark Forces to use. Aaron Giles, who was the Macintosh programmer for Dark Forces, explained that to resolve this problem the memory had to be managed more efficiently.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} also been ported to various consoles. It was ported by Mindscape to the Amiga home {{computers}} in 1992, by Arc System Works to the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear both on 13 July 1993, and by Mindscape to the Amiga CD32 in 1994. Ports for PC <b>DOS</b> <b>and</b> the Atari ST were planned by Mindscape but never released. European CEO of Virgin Interactive, Tim Chaney, purchased the rights for Battletoads from Tradewest after the game found popularity in the United States, and planned a Master System release in 1993; however, it never materialised.|$|E

It was available for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Oric 1 and Oric Atmos, and MSX.

5|$|During the {{transition}} from MS-DOS to Windows, the success of Microsoft's product Microsoft Office allowed the company to gain ground on application-software competitors, such as WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3. Novell, an owner of WordPerfect for a time, alleged that Microsoft used its inside knowledge of the <b>DOS</b> <b>and</b> Windows kernels and of undocumented Application Programming Interface features to make Office perform better than its competitors. Eventually, Microsoft Office became the dominant business suite, with a market share far exceeding that of its competitors. In March 1992, Microsoft released Windows 3.1 along with its first promotional campaign on TV; the software sold over three million copies in its first two months on the market. In October, Windows for Workgroups 3.1 was released with integrated networking abilities such as peer-to-peer file and printing sharing. In November, Microsoft released {{the first version of}} their popular database software Microsoft Access.|$|E
5|$|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom {{satisfied}} both {{of these}} categories. Aside from the original arcade version, the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and ZX Spectrum system had released ports of the arcade game in 1987. By December 1988, the Nintendo Entertainment System had already seen two separate editions of the Temple of Doom game. The first version, distributed by Tengen, came in a black cartridge that was different from Nintendo's traditional grey colour format. By this point, however, Tengen had split from Nintendo and was producing unlicensed games that attempted to circumvent {{the need for a}} 10NES lockout chip. Nintendo filed suit and Tengen lost, forcing it to remove its NES games from the market. The officially licensed version was released by Mindscape {{in the form of a}} standard Nintendo cartridge. Aside from the differences in cover art and cartridge form, however, the actual software of the two games is identical. After the NES version, the game was subsequently released for Atari ST and MSX in 1987, and Amiga, <b>DOS,</b> <b>and</b> Apple in 1989.|$|E

In this paper, I consider the moral status of {{the distinction}} between <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> allowing harm. I look at objections to the doctrine such as James’ Rachels’ Wicked Uncle Case and Jonathan Bennett’s argument that any acceptable analysis of the distinction leaves it implausible that the distinction is morally relevant.

I argue that neither Foot not Quinn provides a satisfactory justification of the Doctrine of <b>Doing</b> <b>and</b> Allowing, but that the idea of self-ownership discussed by Quinn can be developed to provide a justification of the doctrine...|$|R
