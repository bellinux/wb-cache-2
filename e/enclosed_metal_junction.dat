The polarization of this spin current is time-dependent and contains a very small d. c. component.

The observed a. c. -inverse spin Hall voltages are one order of magnitude larger than the conventional d. c. -inverse spin Hall voltages measured on the same device.

40|$|We study low {{temperature}} electron transport in p-wave superconductor-insulator-normal <b>metal</b> <b>junctions.</b> In diffusive <b>metals</b> the p-wave {{component of the}} order parameter decays exponentially at distances larger than the mean free path l. At the superconductor-normal metal boundary, due to spin-orbit interaction, there is a triplet to singlet conversion of the superconducting order parameter. The singlet component survives at distances much larger than l from the boundary. It is this component that controls the {{low temperature}} resistance of the junctions. As a result, {{the resistance of the}} system strongly depends on the angle between the insulating boundary and the d-vector characterizing the spin structure of the triplet superconducting order parameter. We also analyze the spatial dependence of the electric potential {{in the presence of the}} current, and show that the electric field is suppressed in the insulating boundary as well as in the normal metal at distances of order of the coherence length away from the boundary.

40|$|Optical {{trapping}} is {{an important}} tool for studying and manipulating nanoscale objects. Recent experiments have shown that subwavelength control of nanoparticles is possible by using patterned plasmonic nanostructures, rather than using a laser directly, to generate the electric fields necessary for particle trapping. In this thesis we present a theoretical model and experimental evidence for plasmonic optical trapping in nanoscale <b>metal</b> <b>junctions.</b> Further, we examine {{the use of the}} resultant devices as ultrasmall photodectors. Electromigrated nanojunctions, or “nanogaps”, have a well-established plasmon resonance in the near-IR, leading to electric field enhancements large enough for single-molecule sensitivity in Surface-Enhance Raman (SERS) measurements. While molecule-based devices have been carefully studied, optically and electrically probing individual quantum dots in nanoscale <b>metal</b> <b>junctions</b> remains relatively unexplored. Plasmon-based optical trapping of quantum dots into prefabricated structures could allow for inexpensive, scalable luminescent devices which are fully integrable into established silicon-based fabrication techniques. Additionally, these metal-nanocrystal-metal structures are ideal candidates to study optoelectronics in ultrasmall nanocrystals-based structures, as well as more exotic nanoscale phenomena such as blinking, plasmon-exciton interactions, and surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF). We present experimental data supporting plasmon-based optical trapping in the nanogap geometry, and a corresponding numerical model of the electric field-generated forces in the nanogap geometry. Further, we give proof-of-concept measurements of photoconductance in the resultant quantum dot-based devices, as well as challenges and improvements moving forward...|$|R
