The dust-laden <b>gases</b> <b>venturi</b> scrubber enter through the venturi and are accelerated to speeds between 12,000 and 36,000 ft/min (60.97-182.83 m/s). These high-gas velocities immediately atomize the coarse water spray, which is injected radially into the venturi throat, into fine droplets. High energy and extreme turbulence promote collision between water droplets and dust particulates in the throat. The agglomeration process between particle and droplet continues in the diverging section of the venturi. The large agglomerates formed in the venturi are then removed by an inertial separator.|$|R

50|$|The ejector venturi {{is unique}} among {{available}} scrubbing systems since it {{can move the}} process gas {{without the aid of}} a fan or blower.

The partial vacuum is due to the Bernoulli effect, and is similar to water aspirators used in chemistry labs. This partial vacuum can be used to move the process <b>gas</b> through the <b>venturi</b> as well as through the facility's process system.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{in this thesis}} are to present {{a model of a}} variable venturi in an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system located in a heavy duty diesel engine. A new legislation called EURO~ 4 will come into force in 2005 which affects truck development and it will require an On-Board Diagnostic system in the truck. If model based diagnostic systems are to be used, one of the advantages is that the system performance will increase if a model of a variable venturi is used. Three models with different complexity are compared in ten different experiments. The experiments are performed in a steady flow rig at different percentage of EGR <b>gases</b> and <b>venturi</b> areas. The model predicts the mass flow through the venturi. The results show that the first model with fewer simplifications performs better and has fewer errors than the other two models. The simplifications that differ between the models are initial velocity before the venturi and the assumption of incompressible flow. The model that shows the best result is not proposed by known literature in this area of knowledge and technology. This thesis shows that further studies and work on this model, the model with fewer simplifications, can be advantageous...|$|R

In this project the use of advanced processing techniques and neural networks have been used to examine the potential improvement in measurement performance which may be obtained from a system incorporating a standard Venturi tube in combination with a gamma densitometer. The data is pre-processed before being applied to a neural network using simple statistical methods combined with some signal processing techniques. It has been found that this neural network solution performs extremely well when only predicting the gas and liquid phases.

40|$|Wet gas {{metering}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly important problem to the oil and <b>gas</b> industry. The <b>Venturi</b> meter is a favoured device for the metering of the unprocessed wet natural gas production flows. Various combinations of techniques have been employed in annular gas-liquid two phase flows to measure the flow parameters (e. g. liquid film thickness, gas volume fraction and the phase flow rates). One of the most useful techniques which has proven attractive for many multiphase flow applications is the electrical conductance technique. This paper presents an advanced Conductance Venturi Meter which is capable of measuring the gas volume fractions at the inlet and the throat of the Venturi. This model {{is based on the}} measurement of the gas volume fractions at the inlet and the throat of the Venturi meter using a conductance technique. We measure conductance using two ring electrodes flush with the inner surface of the Venturi throat and two ring electrodes flush with the inner surface of the Venturi inlet. The basic operation of the electrical conductance technique in a multiphase flow is that the conductance of the mixture depends on the gas volume fraction in the water. An electronic circuit was built and calibrated to give a dc voltage output which is proportional to the conductance of the mixture which can then be related to the water film thickness in annular flow...|$|R
40|$|As {{revealed}} by Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, countermeasures against severe accidents in {{nuclear power plants}} are an urgent need. In particular, {{from the viewpoint of}} protecting containment and suppressing diffusion of the radioactive materials, it is most important to install filtered venting devices to release high pressure contaminated gas to the atmosphere with elimination radioactive materials in the <b>gas.</b> A Multi <b>Venturi</b> Scrubber System (MVSS) is one of the filtered venting devices, and used in European reactors [1, 2]. One of the main components of the MVSS is a Venturi Scrubber (VS). It is considered that a dispersed or dispersed annular flow is formed in the VS by a self-priming phenomena. In the self-priming phenomena, the liquid was suctioned from a surrounding region of the VS {{to the inside of the}} VS. And a part of the radioactive materials are eliminated through the gas-liquid interface of the dispersed or annular dispersed flow. Therefore, to consider the MVSS operation characteristics, it is important whether to occur the self-priming or not and the liquid flow rate of the self-priming of the VS. The objective of this paper is to understand the self-priming phenomena of the VS for the filtered venting. And theoretical analysis and experiment were conducted. By comparing these results, we discussed about the mechanism of the self-priming phenomena. As results, the self-priming phenomena in the VS was confirmed and, at a high gas flow rate, the suspension of the self-priming is confirmed experimentally and theoretically...|$|R
40|$|A {{gas mixer}} {{prototype}} is developed for mixing air and synthesis gas or “syngas” as a fuel. Syngas is being {{recognized as a}} viable energy source worldwide, particularly for stationary power generation. Syngas has a very low energy density, so a mixer with λ (ratio of actual to stoichiometric air-fuel ratio) {{in the range of}} 1. 1 to 1. 7 is expected. In this study, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling is used to design venturi mixer, coaxial mixer and coaxial mixer with vortex generator. CFD modeling is used to investigate and analyze the influence of the throat diameter, gas chamber thickness and gas exits diameter on mixer characteristics and performance of the venturi mixer. While on the coaxial mixer model, CFD is used to analyze the influences of the primary nozzle exit diameter, constant pressure mixing chamber geometry, constant area mixing chamber geometry, divergent passage geometry, syngas inlet position and primary nozzle exit position on the coaxial mixer characteristics and performance. To design appropriate vortex generator, computational models are used to analyze the influence of the mechanical tab angle, number of tabs and geometry on the mixing characteristics and performance of the coaxial mixer. Attention is focused on the effect of mixers and vortex generator tabs geometry on the air-fuel ratio, pressure loss and mixing quality. Based on the numerical results, an optimized design of <b>venturi</b> <b>gas</b> mixer, coaxial mixer and vortex generator is decided and made. The optimized design of the venturi mixer has λ in the range of 1. 2 to 1. 3, good mixing quality and pressure loss of 46 Pa on air flow rate 100 m 3 /h. The optimized design of the coaxial mixer has λ ranging from 1. 1 to 1. 7 corresponding to pressure losses from 28 to 19 Pa at 100 m 3 /h air-flow rate.

At λ about 1. 2 and 100 m 3 /h air flow rate, the mixing quality of the optimized venturi mixer, coaxial mixer and coaxial mixer equipped with vortex generator have coefficient of variation (CoV) of 0. 67, 0. 88 and 0. 29 respectively...|$|R
