50|$|After leaving university, McLachlan {{worked as}} a {{management}} consultant with Accenture. In 2000, he was employed as a strategy consultant to the AFL by CEO Wayne Jackson. In 2003, he was appointed as General Manager of Commercial Operations and in 2008 was appointed Chief Operating Officer. In December 2012, he was appointed Deputy CEO. Before taking on the CEO role at the AFL, McLachlan {{played a major role}} in delivering stadiums for two new teams - Gold Coast Suns and GWS Giants, established the AFL media department and negotiated the media broadcast deal of $1.25 billion. In 2013, he supervised the AFL's investigation into the Melbourne Football Club tanking scandal and the negotiations with Essendon Football Club supplements controversy. On 30 April 2014, the AFL Chairman Mike Fitzpatrick announced McLachlan would be appointed as AFL CEO replacing Andrew Demetriou. At the announcement of his appointment, McLachlan stated: I’ve been part of the community of football and I know how important it is. I played over 200 games of amateur or country football, I’ve captained a club, I’ve been on a committee of a club, I’m a life member of a club. I’ve had my share of cold showers and freezing committee meetings. I’ve been part of appointing coaches and sacking coaches.

[...] "First it was in people's memories, then it was in manuscripts, then printed books, then microfilm, CD-ROMS, now on the digital internet. Each one of these generations is very important." [...] Voicing a strong reaction {{to the idea of}} books simply being thrown away, and inspired by the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, Kahle envisions collecting one copy of every book ever published. [...] "We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> but that's our goal," [...] he said. [...] "We want to see books live forever." [...] Pointing out that even digital books have a physical home on a hard drive somewhere, he sees saving the physical artifacts of information storage as a way to hedge against the uncertainty of the future. (Alongside the books, Kahle plans to store the Internet Archive's old servers, which were replaced in 2010.) He began by having conventional shipping containers modified as climate-controlled storage units. Each container can hold about 40,000 volumes, the size of a branch library. So far, Kahle has gathered about 500,000 books. He thinks the warehouse itself is large enough to hold about a million titles, with each one given a barcode that identifies the cardboard box, pallet and shipping container in which it resides. A given book may be retrieved in about an hour, and are not to be loaned out but used to verify contents recorded in another medium.Book preservation experts say he'll have to contend with vermin and about a century's worth of books printed on wood pulp paper that decays over time because of its own acidity. Peter Hanff, acting director of the Bancroft Library, the special collections and rare books archive at the University of California, Berkeley, says that just keeping the books on the west coast of the US will save them from the climate fluctuations that are the norm {{in other parts of the}} country.|$|E

When Kjonaas and six other SHAC activists were jailed in 2006, Ferdin vowed to continue the campaign.

[...] Tiffin's 49-yarder with 6:31 left had barely cleared the uprights for the 12-3 lead and, it turns out, the decisive points. That came after Cody batted Lincoln's 43-yard field goal attempt with his left hand. [...] "Neither was an exceptionally good kick, but they both went through and that's what counts," [...] Tiffin said. [...] "I don't know if I watched either one of them go through." [...] Tennessee would get new life when Ingram lost the first fumble of his career in 322 touches, giving the Vols the ball back at the Bama 43. All-American safety Eric Berry jarred the ball loose as Ingram was going down, and then recovered it. Crompton overcame a sack on the first play and completed 4-of-4 passes for 42 yards and the TD to make it 12-10. Alabama had nearly made it three games in a row without allowing a touchdown. The Volunteers now have tested two No. 1 teams. They lost 23-13 to then-No. 1 Florida earlier and Kiffin's team came even closer this time. Tennessee was unranked the last time it beat an AP No. 1, topping Auburn 38-20 in 1985. [...] "On the sideline, we just {{knew we were going to}} win in those last 4 seconds," [...] Stocker said.

This differentiating attitude in ICT integration {{can be attributed to the}} teachers’ personal confidence in using ICTs. This paper explores the ICT integration journey of teacher’s from 10 provincial primary schools in Queensland, Australia. It will examine the teachers’ past and present attitudes toward the integration of ICTs in their classrooms and attempt to predict their future attitudes. Participants will also be invited to discuss attitudes towards ICT integration from their perspective...|$|E

5000|$|The Romans {{and ancient}} {{travelers}} in general {{did not use}} maps.

On the Roman road system, however, the traveller needed some idea of where he was <b>going,</b> how <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> and how long it would take. The itinerarium filled this need. In origin it was simply a list of cities along a road: [...] "at their most basic, itineraria involve the transposition of information given on milestones, which were an integral feature of the major Roman roads, to a written script." [...] It was only a short step from lists to a master list. To sort out the lists, the Romans drew diagrams of parallel lines showing the branches of the roads. Parts of these were copied and sold on the streets. The very best featured symbols for cities, way stations, water courses, and so on. The maps did not represent landforms but they served the purpose of a simple schematic diagram for the user.|$|R
