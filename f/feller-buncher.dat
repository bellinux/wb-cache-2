50|$|Conventional clearcut {{harvesting}} {{is relatively}} simple: all trees on a cutblock are felled and bunched with bunches aligned to the skidding direction, and a skidder then drags the bunches {{to the closest}} log deck. <b>Feller-buncher</b> operators concentrate on {{the width of the}} felled swath, the number of trees in a bunch, and the alignment of the bunch. Providing a perimeter boundary is felled during daylight, night-shift operations can continue without the danger of trespassing beyond the block. Productivity of equipment is maximized because units can work independently of one another.|$|E

50|$|Avoidance {{of damage}} to the {{understorey}} {{will always be a}} desideratum. Sauder's (1990) paper on mixedwood harvesting describes studies designed to evaluate methods of reducing non-trivial damage to understorey residuals that would compromise their chance of becoming a future crop tree. Sauder concluded that: (1) operational measures that protected residual stems may not unduly increase costs, (2) all felling, conifers and hardwoods, {{needs to be done in}} one operation to minimize the entry of the <b>feller-buncher</b> into the residual stand, (3) several operational procedures can reduce understorey damage, some of them without incurring extra costs, and (4) successful harvesting of treatment blocks depends primarily on the intelligent location of skid trails and landings. In summary, the key to protecting the white spruce understorey without sacrificing logging efficiency is a combination of good planning, good supervision, the use of appropriate equipment, and having conscientious, well-trained operators.Even the best plan will not reduce understorey damage unless its implementation is supervised.|$|E
50|$|Wounds {{inflicted on}} {{residual}} trees during partial cutting often provide portals for decay fungi. Affected trees {{are prone to}} blowdown and breakage at the wound site, {{and even if they}} survive to rotation age their value is reduced by staining and decay in the wood. The influence of temperature on microbial diversity in wounds in white and black spruces was investigated by Dumas and McLaughlin (2003). Samples were taken from trees wounded during manual or <b>feller-buncher</b> partial cutting and skidding operations in the Black Sturgeon Forest, 120 km northeast of Thunder Bay, Ontario. The samples were taken from 76 trees in early October when the mean aerial temperature exceeded 0 °C and 23 trees in late October/early November when the mean aerial temperature was below 0 °C, to serve as the pre-freeze-up and post-freeze-up groups, respectively. The wounds were sampled and cultured. The number and ratio of bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi on one-week-old wounds varied between pre- and post- freeze-up wounds, wound locations, and media. However, random samples of the different classes of microbes isolated from the 2 spruce species did not differ significantly, indicating no relationship between tree species and microbe. Wounds were more common on stems (94) than on roots (64) or butts (33). Wounds on roots averaged 2 and 3 times the area of those on stems and butts, respectively. More bacteria than fungi were isolated from the pre-freeze-up wounds than from the post-freeze-up wounds, while fungi were more plentiful than bacteria on the post freeze-up wounds.|$|E

The study was carried out for a self-levelling tracked <b>feller-buncher</b> in a 24 -year old radiata pine (Pinus radiata) plantation near Port Arthur, Tasmania, Australia undertaking a clear felling operation. Tree heights and diameter at breast height were measured prior to the harvesting operation. Low intensity LiDAR (> 3 points m- 2) flown in 2011 over the study site was used to derive slope classes. A time and motion study carried out for the harvesting operation was used to evaluate the impact of tree volume and slope on the <b>feller-buncher</b> productivity.

Understanding the characteristics of the logging workforce can help forest managers make better decisions related to harvesting operations. We surveyed logging business owners across Virginia’s three physiographic regions (Mountains, Piedmont, and Coastal Plain). Overall, logging businesses reported an average production rate of 761. 37 t/business/week, but this varied substantially by region, with the highest production rates in the Coastal Plain (1403. 55 t/business/week), followed by the Piedmont (824. 69 t/business/week) and the Mountains (245. 42 t/business/week).

Four machines were studied, two Bell TF 120 <b>feller-bunchers</b> and two Timbco T 445 hydro-bunchers. The machines broke between 84 % and 100 % of the trees felled. Most causes of breakage could not be determined. Of that which could, falling trees striking stumps and previously felled logs accounted {{for the majority of the}} breakage.

50|$|The {{first step}} in even aged timber {{management}} is to select a suitable stand for harvest. Trees must be of merchantable size, a desirable species, and in an area accessible to harvesting equipment. Once selected, the stand is harvested (usually using <b>feller-bunchers,</b> skidders, and processors). Merchantable trees (trees with boles {{large enough to be}} sold to a mill) are harvested and processed whereas unmerchantable trees (trees that are too small or of an undesirable species) are either crushed by machinery or cut to make equipment movement easier. This process is called clearcutting, and the end result is a cutblock. At this stage, the forestry company is required to replant the same proportion of species that were there previous to harvest. Usually, silviculture techniques are employed to ensure that species survive and grow in the proper proportion. Shade-intolerant species such as trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and marsh reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis) will thrive in the open conditions of a clearcut, outcompeting shade-tolerant species such as white spruce (Picea glauca). Mechanical site preparation and herbicide treatments are often applied initially to allow for adequate shade-tolerant growth. This way, the shade-tolerants are given a head start and the shade-intolerants will catch up over time once silviculture treatments are stopped, resulting in an even-aged stand of trees with little vertical stratification.|$|R

We completed a gross and continuous timing study on a 67 hectare whole tree chip harvest (skidder, 2 <b>feller-bunchers,</b> disk chipper, and tracked loader) in southern Alabama in order to compare production rates, harvest costs, and landowner returns.

40|$|In New Zealand, {{the forest}} {{industry}} is economically significant, representing {{the third largest}} export by value. Harvesting and extraction of trees pose serious health and safety issues. These issues have become more pronounced with the prevalence of forestry blocks established on steep slopes. The steep slopes (> 20 °) preclude the operation of traditional machines such as harvesters and <b>feller-bunchers.</b> Without mechanization, felling is performed manually by ground crew with hand-held chainsaws. The forest industry now leads fatality and injury statistics with 42 % and 35 % respectively caused during the felling process. The purpose of this research, therefore, is to design and build a semi-autonomous tree felling robot suitable for the unique forestry conditions found in New Zealand. This is motivated {{by the desire to}} reduce the aforementioned fatality and injury statistics. Currently available machinery for forest harvesting is not suitable for New Zealand’s steep terrain. Tracked and wheeled vehicles cause significant damage to the hill side and struggle to provide sufficient traction on slopes. Vehicles with a high center of mass can roll, putting the driver in danger; a problem exacerbated by the slope inclination. Although some machines have been modified for increased stability on steep terrain, their lack of agility and continued damage to the terrain is prohibitive. Therefore, from literature {{of the state of the}} art, it is seen that there is no suitable forest harvesting machine compatible with New Zealand’s terrain and the requirements of forest managers. The proposed solution is a system using arboreal locomotion similar to that used by monkeys, resulting in a machine supported in the trees rather than on the ground. This method of traversal between trees has not been used for forestry previously and introduces a paradigm shift for forest planning. Due to the unique motion of this machine, it can traverse over terrain typically impractical for traditional ground based felling systems. In order to provide semi-autonomy and remote operation, a suite of sensors and control systems are required for this new application. A novel tree detection algorithm using laser scanning is proposed as a solution to gaining situational awareness for the environment. This enables the robot to identify neighboring trees and analyze which are suitable for traversal and are ready to be harvested. Identification of objects such as trees, ground and other clutter are used in motion planning in order to avoid collisions. Choosing a suitable route through the forest can be a difficult problem for remote operators. Therefore a route planning algorithm is developed to find suitable routes. The planning algorithm considers the known kinematics of the machine and combines a-priori map information with gathered data to calculate routes through the entire forest to minimize a cost function. The cost function is determined by the forest manager with considerations towards fuel consumption, time and yield for example. This system allows forest managers to maximise the robot’s utility. Finally, to provide tree felling capability, an autonomous felling mechanism is presented. In a novel development, force sensors are integrated into the chainsaw bar. These senors provide real-time feedback to the felling algorithm regarding the downwards force of the tree on the bar. By measuring the force, the state of the tree fall can be determined allowing correct timing to be achieved. This document outlines the advancements to the state of the art through theoretic basis, conceptual development, methodology and results gathered in the laboratory and field.

40|$|A {{research}} {{trial was}} conducted in Victoria, Australia, to evaluate a self-levelling feller- -buncher on steep terrain and its potential to improve the overall productivity of steep terrain cable logging. The production study was conducted for a mechanized harvesting system using a Valmet 445 EXL self-levelling tracked <b>feller-buncher</b> and a Madill 124 swing yarder while operating in a clear fell plantation. This study quantified the equipment productivity of steep slope harvesting in a 33 year-old Pinus radiata D. Don (radiata pine) plantation. Mechanized felling {{was an integral part}} of this operation, although there were areas of motor- manually felled trees due to terrain and stream restrictions. Thus the difference in productivity of the yarder for bunched and unbunched trees was quantified. For an average piece size of 0. 8 m^ 3, a productivity of 138 m^ 3 /PMH was predicted for the <b>feller-buncher.</b> Bunching substantially improved the productivity of the swing yarder. Mean volume per cycle for the swing yarder was 1. 9 m^ 3 for bunched trees versus 1. 3 m^ 3 for unbunched trees. For a yarding distance range between 150 and 240 metres, bunching increased the productivity by 25 %. These results show the potential of self-levelling feller-bunchers in cable logging operations and suggest that research into mechanised felling be directed towards acquiring more information on the performance of steep terrain feller-bunchers in larger trees sizes, and under other slope and soil conditions in Australia.

The results showed that productivity of the fellerbuncher and processor were significantly affected by tree size. Productivity of the skidder was dependent on extraction distance. The unit cost (from stand to roadside) averaged AD 18. 68 /m 3...|$|E
40|$|Proper tending {{operations}} in young stands increase {{the quality of}} valuable roundwood and {{reduce the risk of}} stand damages caused by wind and snow-breaks, and infestation of bark beetles. When felling and extracting small diameter trees, costs often exceed the potential revenues. Mechanized thinning performed by using a forwarder mounted <b>feller-buncher</b> head could improve this cost-effectiveness. Atime study was carried out in a 35 – 40 year old Scots Pine–Oak dominated stand. Productivity and costs were investigated of a Timberjack 1110 D forwarder equipped with the felling-bunching head Moipu 400 E. Further objectives were to give practical recommendations for the system in the field. The harvesting productivity was 4. 11 m 3 /PSH 0 (effective working hour) or 3. 16 m 3 /PSH 15 with an average tree volume of 0. 057 m 3, an average load volume of 3. 71 m³, and the average forwarding distance 89 m. The supply costs from forest to plant (felling, forwarding, chipping, and transportation) were 91. 60 eur/PSH 15 or 77. 84 eur per oven dry ton. In Austria it is possible to achieve revenues of 78. 00 eur per oven dry ton. Therefore it is possible to gain profit. The <b>feller-buncher</b> head Moipu 400 E is best suited to cut Pine trees up to a maximum diameter at the butt of about 30 cm, and Oak and Beech up to 25 cm. In order to keep the felling- bunching costs at a reasonable level, mechanized harvesting should be done at sites where the average volume of removed trees is over 0. 05 m³ per tree...|$|E
40|$|Slope is a {{major factor}} {{affecting}} forest harvesting machine productivity. As ground-based harvesting methods are generally cheaper than the alternatives, forest managers need to know when ground-based harvesting equipment can be used on sloping sites. The study objective was to determine the effect of slope on the productivity, cycle time and elemental times of a Valmet 450 FXL self-levelling processor processing a 24 year-old, unthinned radiata pine plantation previously felled and stacked by a <b>feller-buncher.</b> The study site slope was estimated using a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) derived digital terrain model and classified using the regional terrain classification system. Study trees were selected from areas predominantly in the hilly (12 – 19 °) and steep (20 – 26 °) slope classes, as these classes made up the majority of the study site area. In contrast to previous research, {{no significant differences were found}} between the processor productivity, cycle time and elemental times (moving/positioning, swinging and processing) between the slope classes. This was believed to result from the processor working well within its capabilities processing the relatively small trees on the study site. Other important factors may have included that the trees were pre-felled by a <b>feller-buncher</b> and placed in high density rows with their butt ends aligned, which minimised the processor boom and track movements, and that steep slope trees were selected from areas at the lower end of the steep slope class (20 – 23 °). Further research is needed to determine whether the processor productivity would be significantly lower when processing larger trees on steeper slopes...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to ergonomically {{evaluate}} a <b>feller-buncher,</b> used in harvesting operations of Eucalyptus, in a forestry enterprise {{in the region of}} Brasilandia, state of Minas Gerais-Brazil. The following parameters were evaluate : access to the cabin, cabin, visibility, operator seat,controls and operation of the machine, noise level, vibration, climate control in the cabin, exhaustionof gases and dust, illumination and maintenance, according to the manual on “Ergonomic Guidelinesfor Forest Machines”, by Skogforsk. A qualitative evaluation was performed for all items, except fornoise level, that was quantified by using a decibelimeter. According to the observations, each parameterwas classified as A, B, C, D or 0 (zero), being. A that with the best working conditions,and 0, the least favorable. The results classified the items as follows: in class A, vibration; in class B,visibility, operator seat, controls and operation of the machine, noise level, climate control in thecabin, and exhaustion of gases and dust; in class C, cabin and illumination; in class D, access to thecabin. Therefore, none of the parameters was considered as class 0. The <b>feller-buncher</b> obtained anoverall classification as B, indicating a highly productive work, slightly below the best level A, thuspresenting a high level of active and passive working safety. It was also observed that some adjustment is required to adapt the working space of the machine to the Brazilian operator. It isapparent that his antropometric characteristics are less favorable than for the Europeans, for which the machine was designed. This results in much more effort required for operation by workers...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{technically}} and economically evaluate the <b>Feller-buncher</b> in different conditions of harvest in eucalypt forests of second cut. The technical analysis included {{a study of}} time and movements by the method of continuous time, and operational performance was determined by volume in cubic meters of harvested wood. The economic analysis included the parameters of operational cost, harvest cost and energy consumption. The {{analysis of the data}} showed that the composition of main line harvesting and the arrangement of bundles of trees influenced operational performance. The average operational cost was US$ 86. 26 per hour of actual work, which resulted in an average cost of forest harvesting of US$ 1. 09 m(- 3) ...|$|E
40|$|Australia is at {{an early}} stage of {{exploring}} the use of forest biomass to generate energy. This study evaluated the biomass yield and the productivity rates of equipment for harvesting biomass in a poor-quality eucalypt plantation. The operation consisted of a tracked <b>feller-buncher,</b> grapple skidder and mobile chipper. Time study methods were used to measure the harvesting operation. A multiple regression model was constructed to predict skidding productivity. Biomass production was 63. 9 t ha− 1 based on the recorded load weight of eight trucks. Delays were documented and analysed. The average delay for all equipment was about 30 % of working time. The study results will help guide biomass harvesting managers to estimate productivity and cost of similar operation sites...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{economics}} of short rotation forestry (SRF) in Austria {{and is based on}} a net-present-value calculation. The aims of this study were to evaluate the profitability of SRF under various scenarios and to provide information on economically optimal production decisions. Dynamic systems analysis was applied to model biophysical growth, costs, and benefits of a poplar plantation. The model includes two different harvesting systems (cut-and-chip harvester, <b>feller-buncher</b> harvester) and two transportation systems (transportation of wood chips with tractor or truck). The model takes into account variations in biomass growth based on different plant densities and rotation periods as well as biomass decay and heating value depending on the chosen harvesting system and length of storage. The results indicate that SRF can be profitable under certain conditions in Austria...|$|E
