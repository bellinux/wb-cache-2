25|$|As the {{original}} Tu-154 and Tu-154A suffered wing cracks {{after a few}} years in service, a version with a new, stronger wing, designated Tu-154B, went into production in 1975. It also had an <b>extra</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> in the fuselage, extra emergency exits in the tail, and the maximum takeoff weight increased to 98,000 kg (216,053 lb). Also important to Aeroflot was that the increased passenger capacity led to lower operating costs. As long as the airplane had the NK-8-2U engines the only way to improve the economics of the airplane was to spread costs across more seats. The autopilot was certified for ICAO Category II automatic approaches. Most previously built Tu-154 and Tu-154A were also modified into this variant, with the replacement of the wing. Maximum takeoff weight increased to 96,000 kg (211,644 lb). 111 were built.|$|E
500|$|The I-200 prototypes {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} a number of proposals. For example, the second prototype was fitted with a prototype of the AM-37 engine and first flew with that engine on 6 January 1941. It experienced severe vibration problems and, despite efforts to cure the problems, failed during a flight on 7 May, and was destroyed in the ensuing crash. The third prototype was generally used for armament trials, experimenting with [...] RS-82 rockets among other weapons. For another trial it was equipped with the experimental [...] MP-3 autocannon carried underneath the wings in external pods and redesignated as the IP-201. The 12.7mm UBS gun was removed for these tests and the space freed up was used to install an <b>extra</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b> Initially the cannon had the low rate of fire of only 300 rounds per minute, but this was soon doubled and the gun was renamed the MP-6. Installation of the guns was difficult, despite the aircraft's metal outer wing panels, and the wings deformed when the cannon were first mounted. It made its first and only flight on 1 December 1940 carrying two MP-6s and two 12.7mm AP-12.7 machine guns, but a blocked fuel line caused a forced landing before the guns could be fired. Testing {{on a variety of}} other aircraft revealed very unsatisfactory performance from the guns and their development was canceled. The designers were arrested on 15 May 1941 and executed on 28 October 1941.|$|E

2500|$|Five STs were built, each powered with a 95HP Menasco B4 engine [...] {{before the}} {{follow-on}} ST-A [...] (A for Aerobatic) was developed {{with a more}} powerful 125HP Menasco C4 engine. A single ST-B was produced, this being an ST-A with only one seat and an <b>extra</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> where the front cockpit normally was; this aircraft was subsequently converted back to ST-A standard. The ST-A was further developed as the ST-A Special, with a super-charged 150HP Menasco C4-S engine of increased power.|$|E
2500|$|The Model 22, {{although}} {{produced in}} fairly small numbers, has been operated by private and commercial owners {{in several countries}} including the United States and Australia. Its Garrett AiResearch cabin pressurization system gives the equivalent of [...] at the aircraft's operational ceiling of [...] As a demonstration of its high performance, the second production aircraft was flown non-stop from New York to the Paris Air Show in June 1967, the flight taking 13 hours 10 minutes. The achievement is recorded on the display board in the accompanying photograph. The aircraft had been fitted with an <b>extra</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> for the flight. In 2001, 24 aircraft remained in service.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{cancellation}} of the TSR-2, and then the substitute American General Dynamics F-111K, the Royal Air Force still required a replacement for its Canberras in the low-level strike role, while the planned retirement for the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers meant that the RAF would also need to add a maritime strike capability. [...] It was therefore decided in 1968 that the RAF would adopt the Buccaneer, both by the purchase of new-build aircraft, and by taking over the Fleet Air Arm's Buccaneers as the carriers were retired. [...] A total of 46 new-build aircraft for the RAF were built by Blackburn's successor, Hawker Siddeley, designated S.2B. [...] These had RAF-type communications and avionics equipment, Martel air-to-surface missile capability, and could be equipped with a bulged bomb-bay door containing an <b>extra</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Lightning {{featured}} a conformal ventral store to house either a fuel tank or a rocket engine. The rocket engine, a Napier Double Scorpion motor, also contained a reserve of [...] of high-test peroxide (HTP) {{to drive the}} rocket’s turbopump and act as an oxidizer; fuel would have been drawn from the aircraft internal tankage. The rocket engine was intended {{at an early stage}} in the Lightning’s development to boost performance should non-afterburning (reheated) engines be fitted; the subsequent basic performance with reheated Avons was deemed sufficient and the rocket engine option was cancelled in 1958. The ventral store was routinely used as an <b>extra</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank,</b> holding [...] of usable fuel. On later variants of the Lightning, a ventral weapons pack could be installed to equip the aircraft alternatively with different armaments, including missiles, rockets, and cannons.|$|E

Bernadou had been modified for long range escort work by replacing the fourth boiler and stack with an <b>extra</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b> Nicholson had the only functional radar, though the merchant ship Toward could provide support with its High-frequency direction finding (HF/DF) set. Lea carried a British ASV aircraft radar with fixed antennae, but the coaxial cable to the antennae was repeatedly shorted by salt water spray. Edison had no depth charge throwers, and was limited to a linear pattern rolled off the stern. The American ships {{did not have enough}} binoculars.
