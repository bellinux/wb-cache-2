5|$|After the event, Dumoulin {{said that}} he {{prepared}} at altitude for the race and that he produced a hard physical effort on the uphill section and went less intensely on the <b>flatter</b> parts.|$|E
5|$|Although van der Weyden did not {{adhere to}} the {{conventions}} of idealisation, he generally sought to <b>flatter</b> his sitters. He depicted his models in highly fashionable clothing, often with rounded—almost sculpted—facial features, some of which deviated from natural representation. He adapted his own aesthetic, and his portraits of women often bear {{a striking resemblance to}} each other.|$|E
5|$|At {{its lower}} reaches, the terrain grows <b>flatter</b> and less rocky, {{supporting}} oak, mesquite and juniper. As it meanders through Wilson and Karnes Counties, passing Zuehl, New Berlin, La Vernia, Sutherland Springs, and Cestohowa, Cibolo Creek meets with the San Antonio River near the ghost town of Helena.|$|E

5|$|I {{had it in}} my head {{to write}} an epic of it, but though I still hanker after it, I see clearly it would be foolish, for no verse could render {{the best parts of}} it, and it would only be a <b>flatter</b> and tamer version of a thing already existing.|$|E
5|$|In Eastern inland Norway and Trøndelag, {{the houses}} around a tun were {{typically}} organized {{in a square}} (firkanttun); in Gudbrandsdal, there was a distinction between inntun (inner tun) and uttun (outer tun). The configuration of houses also depended on whether the farm was situated on a hill or in <b>flatter</b> terrain.|$|E
5|$|In a 2017 paper, Gwee {{and colleagues}} found that boobook populations on larger mountainous islands were more {{distinct}} from Australian stock, while those on <b>flatter</b> smaller islands {{were much more}} similar, suggesting that these locations were colonised much more recently after previous populations had become extinct.|$|E

5|$|Paris–Roubaix is {{sometimes}} {{compared to the}} other famous cobbled race, the Tour of Flanders in Belgium. Paris–Roubaix is <b>flatter</b> and has more difficult cobbles while the Tour of Flanders contains a series of hills, many on cobbles, like the Koppenberg or Kapelmuur.|$|E
5|$|The late stelae at Seibal show {{a marked}} {{reduction}} in quality over {{a span of}} about forty years, {{with the loss of}} Classic Period traits, and bearing <b>flatter</b> and cruder representations than earlier stelae. This may reflect the loss of expertise in the Terminal Classic, with craftsmen less able to work monuments and large structures as time progressed.|$|E
5|$|The rotor of the Wankel {{engine is}} shaped as a {{curvilinear}} triangle {{that is often}} cited {{as an example of}} a Reuleaux triangle. However, its curved sides are somewhat <b>flatter</b> than those of a Reuleaux triangle and so it does not have constant width.|$|E

5|$|The {{spectral}} {{properties of}} the halo ring {{are different from the}} main ring. The flux distribution in the range 0.5–2.5μm is <b>flatter</b> than in the main ring; the halo is not red and may even be blue.|$|E
5|$|Art historians {{disagree}} on when and why onion domes became a typical feature of Russian architecture. Byzantine churches and {{the architecture of}} Kievan Rus were characterized by broader, <b>flatter</b> domes without a special framework erected above the drum. In contrast to this ancient form, each drum of a Russian church is surmounted by a special structure of metal or timber, which is lined with sheet iron or tiles.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of tadpoles lack lids, but at metamorphosis, {{the cornea}} becomes more dome-shaped, the lens becomes <b>flatter,</b> and eyelids and {{associated}} glands and ducts develop. The adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were {{a first step}} in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes. They allow colour vision and depth of focus. In the retinas are green rods, which are receptive {{to a wide range of}} wavelengths.|$|E
60|$|Raja Vikram was silent, {{nor did he}} {{acknowledge}} the Baital's indirect compliment.

5|$|The route {{begins with}} zigzags through turf, before {{reaching}} a <b>flatter</b> boggy area {{in front of}} Llyn Ffynnon-y-gwas. The path then climbs to Bwlch Cwm Brwynog, and then snakes along the ridge above Clogwyn Du'r Arddu towards the summit. This path meets the railway, the Llanberis Path, the Crib Goch path, and the combined Pyg Track and Miners' Track all within a short distance, just below the summit.|$|E
5|$|There are {{physical}} {{differences between}} the show strains and working strains in the UK. While the show strain is bred to the conformation standard, the working strain is bred for working ability and as such several physical differences have appeared. Working type dogs tend to be larger with <b>flatter</b> heads and shorter ears. The coat also tends to be shorter and finer than the show variety and have less feathering. The working strain {{seems to be more}} energetic than the show strain.|$|E
5|$|With this knowledge, {{and a more}} {{accurate}} Smeaton number, the Wrights designed their 1902 glider. Using another crucial discovery from the wind tunnel, they made the airfoil <b>flatter,</b> reducing the camber (the depth of the wing's curvature divided by its chord). The 1901 wings had significantly greater curvature, a highly inefficient feature the Wrights copied directly from Lilienthal. Fully confident in their new wind tunnel results, the Wrights discarded Lilienthal's data, now basing their designs on their own calculations.|$|E

5|$|All known planets transit the star; {{this means}} that all six planets' orbits appear to cross {{in front of their}} star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations {{relative}} to Earth's line of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight they are, vary by {{a little more than a}} degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star. Simulations suggest that the mean mutual inclinations of the planetary orbits are about 1°, meaning the system is probably more coplanar (<b>flatter)</b> than the Solar System, where the corresponding figure is 2.3°.|$|E
5|$|Between 1800 and 1814, a dog named Barry {{lived as}} a rescue dog at the hospice, and was famous enough {{at the time}} for his body to be {{preserved}} at the Natural History Museum of Bern. However, during the preservation, the taxidermist {{and the director of}} the Museum agreed to modify the body towards what they thought was a good example of the breed during that period. The head itself was further modified in 1923 to represent the Saint Bernard of that era. Prior to this the skull was a great deal <b>flatter</b> with a moderate stop.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} a pass in the {{mountain}} range, winds will rush through the pass with considerable speed because of the Bernoulli principle that describes an inverse relationship between speed and pressure. The airflow can remain turbulent and erratic for some distance downwind into the <b>flatter</b> countryside. These conditions are dangerous to ascending and descending airplanes. Cool winds accelerating through mountain gaps have been given regional names. In Central America, examples include the Papagayo wind, the Panama wind, and the Tehuano wind. In Europe, similar winds are known as the Bora, Tramontane, and Mistral. When these winds blow over open waters, they increase mixing of the upper layers of the ocean that elevates cool, nutrient rich waters to the surface, which leads to increased marine life.|$|E
