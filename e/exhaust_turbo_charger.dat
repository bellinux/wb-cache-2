40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is based on {{increasing}} efficiency of an internal combustion engine, by using <b>exhaust</b> gas temperature. <b>Turbo</b> <b>charging</b> and super charging techniques are already in use in some of the vehicles, there charging is carried out in internal combustion engine by means of kinetic energy of exhaust gas. Here we pioneer exhaust gas heat recovery by steam turbocharging technique. This method will give solution to some problems happened by over heat generation of exhaust gas. The increasing worldwide problem regarding rapid economy development and a relative shortage of energy, the internal combustion engine exhaust waste heat and environmental pollution has been more emphasized heavily recently. Out of the total heat supplied to the engine in the form of fuel, approximately, 30 to 40 % is converted into useful mechanical work; the remaining heat is expelled to the environment through exhaust gases and engine cooling systems, resulting in to entropy rise and serious environmental pollution, so it is required to utilized waste heat into useful work. It also reduces the amount of waste heat and greenhouse gases damped to environment. It describes loss of exhaust gas energy of an internal combustion engine. It provide the possible method to recover the waste heat from internal combustion engine and performance of the internal combustion engine. Steam <b>turbo</b> <b>charging</b> technique {{is the best way to}} recover waste heat and to improve the efficiency of an IC engine by 10 to 20 percentag...|$|R
