40|$|To invistigate the {{appropriateness}} of tropical hardwood thinnings of fast-growing species for structural use, mechanical tests were carried out on bending, shearing and cleavage properties for small clear specimens, and bending properties for full-scale <b>dimension</b> <b>lumbers.</b> The species tested were Acacia mangium (Acacia mangium Willd.), Kamerere (Eucalyptus deglupta Bl.), Gmelina (Gmelina arborea Linn.), and Albizzia (Albizia falcata Backer.).

An adequate correlation was derived between bending properties (modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity) and wood density for small clear specimens, and its relationship {{was similar to that}} obtained from data on Japanese timbers. 2. The presence of knots and sloping grain reduced the modulus of rupture of <b>dimension</b> <b>lumbers</b> by 13 to 23 % when compared to those of small clear specimens, while it affected little on modulus of elasticity. 3.

50|$|These goals can be {{achieved}} {{through the use of}} appropriate operating practices, many of which can be potentially mutually beneficial to all. In many cases, it may be useful for firebreak upkeep to be used in concert with the harvesting of forestry products such as lumber and biomass fuel, since the objectives are fundamentally related, in that the basic goals are to remove material from the forest. Furthermore, if done properly, the value of these products can significantly offset the cost of maintaining the firebreak. In addition, these commercial industries and small businesses are helped by a reduction in the property damages caused by wildfires, and reduced risk of investment. The biomass material that is not suitable for <b>dimensioned</b> <b>lumber,</b> is suitable to make woodchips for the paper industry, and the energy industry.

5000|$|Plywood {{production}} {{requires a}} good log, called a peeler, {{which is generally}} straighter and larger in diameter than one required for processing into <b>dimensioned</b> <b>lumber</b> by a sawmill. The log is laid horizontally and rotated about its long axis while a long blade is pressed into it, causing {{a thin layer of}} wood to peel off (much as a continuous sheet of paper from a roll). An adjustable nosebar, which may be solid or a roller, is pressed against the log during rotation, to create a [...] "gap" [...] for veneer to pass through between the knife and the nosebar. The nosebar partly compresses the wood as it is peeled; it controls vibration of the peeling knife; and assists in keeping the veneer being peeled to an accurate thickness. In this way the log is peeled into sheets of veneer, which are then cut to the desired oversize dimensions, to allow it to shrink (depending on wood species) when dried. The sheets are then patched, graded, glued together and then baked in a press at a temperature of at least , and at a pressure of up to [...] (but more commonly 200 psi) to form the plywood panel. The panel can then be patched, have minor surface defects such as splits or small knot holes filled, re-sized, sanded or otherwise refinished, depending on the market for which it is intended.|$|R

30|$|There are {{significant}} {{differences on the}} design value of mechanical properties for the same grade <b>dimension</b> <b>lumber,</b> because different countries have different evaluation methods, load statistics, and load combinations. For example, the statistics of snow load (q), which equals the ratio average value and standard value, is 1.04 in China, but q value ranges from 0.61 to 0.82 in the United States [9]. Furthermore,design value of wood strength is generally determined by full-size testing and small clear specimens testing [10]. Comparing these two methods, the full-size testing takes natural defect, size effect, and other factors into consideration. Therefore, the test results are {{much closer to the}} actual situation. The previous research [11] reported that the length had significant effect on tensile strength of visually graded Chinese fir <b>dimension</b> <b>lumber.</b> Currently,the full-size testing method has been applied in the United States, Canada, and Japan to determine the flexural, compressive, and tensile strength of <b>dimension</b> <b>lumber</b> [12, 13].

5000|$|<b>Lumber's</b> nominal <b>dimensions</b> {{are larger}} than the actual {{standard}} <b>dimensions</b> of finished <b>lumber.</b> Historically, the nominal dimensions were {{the size of the}} green (not dried), rough (unfinished) boards that eventually became smaller finished lumber through drying and planing (to smooth the wood). Today, the standards specify the final finished dimensions and the mill cuts the logs to whatever size it needs to achieve those final dimensions. Typically, that rough cut is smaller than the nominal dimensions because modern technology makes it possible and it uses the logs more efficiently. For example, a [...] "2×4" [...] board historically started out as a green, rough board actually 2 × 4 in. After drying and planing, it would be smaller, by a nonstandard amount.

30|$|In {{the process}} of drying lumber, the {{variability}} in final moisture content (MCf) between lumbers {{is one of the}} major concerns. Factors that influence the MCf of lumber have been studied extensively and it has been shown that MCf depends on many wood properties, such as initial MC (MCi) [1 – 3], basic density (BD) [2 – 6], annual ring orientation (ARO) [3, 6 – 8], heartwood ratio (HR) [1, 3, 8 – 10], as well as <b>dimensions</b> of <b>lumber</b> and species. The ARO refers to the growth ring orientation relative to the main drying surfaces as seen from the lumber’s end. However, the past studies generally have employed simple linear correlation analysis between the pair of MCf and the above wood properties, and rarely have accounted for their interrelations. Therefore, the correlations obtained in the past studies were significant but weak. An exception is the study by Berberović [3], who used multiple regression analysis to investigate the impact of many wood properties on the drying rate of Tsuga heterophylla lumber. It was found that MCi, BD, HR and ARO influenced drying rate for the drying at 80  °C and only MCi for the drying at 115  °C. However, the wood property variables in the multiple regressions are intercorrelated with each other, and this makes it impossible to assess the relative importance of individual variables from the equation. Hence, more sophisticated multivariate data analysis is required to evaluate the wood properties that influence the MCf and the extent to which it is influential.|$|R

40|$|Summary- Commercial {{experience}} with the sawing of logs from fast-grown plantations has shown {{that there can be}} significant drying distortion associated with the presence of juvenile wood. In New Zealand this is a growing concern due to the reduction of rotation ages for radiata pine (Pinus radiata D Don) to around 25 - 30 years. The purpose of this analysis was to use the results of sawing studies to identify some of the major factors affecting distortion of the final product (structural lumber in this case) and test the feasibility of modeling the relationships. Analyses of some 9 000 individual boards (100 x 40 and 100 x 50 mm) from 1 000 logs indicated the need to take into account a range of factors relating to the raw material (logs), secondary processing technology (sawing pattern, drying method and the influence of planing), product (<b>lumber</b> <b>dimensions)</b> and standards (grading rules). The strong propensity for lumber from small diameter and physiologically young logs to degrade was confirmed and over 90 % of the problem was related to twist rather than crook or bow. In the worst cases (small juvenile logs, low temperature drying, no planing) up to 80 % of the boards were categorized as ’rejects’. At the other extreme, large diameter mature logs dried according to recommended practices and those that were machined to final size showed around a 5 % rate of rejection. Diameter was shown to be the most influential log property. Spiral grain was also important due to its influence on twist during drying...|$|R

The limited wood supply due to natural forest degradation can be increased by wood harvested from plantation forests, including wood of suren (Toona sureni Merr) as one species composing the forests. In timber processing wood drying is an important aspect determining product quality. This study aimed to identify the effect of drying method and sortimen dimension on drying character of suren wood. Trunks of 3 suren trees of seven to nine years old were cut from Manggihan village, Getasan district, Semarang regency. The bolts were sawn (using blambangan method) to obtain sortimen papan wood of 3 cm (thickness), 8 cm (width), and 210 cm (length) and sortiment usuk wood of 4 cm, 6 cm and 210 cm. Beside two levels of sortimen size, two levels of drying method, e. g. natural and solar drying were also used in this research. Resulted data were analyzed with factorial complete randomized design. Measured parameters consisted of drying rate, dimension shrinkage and some drying defects e. g. bowing, cupping, end check, surface check and fungi infection. Research results showed that drying methods significantly affect drying rate, but not other parameters. Also, product dimension affects significantly to drying rate, but not other parameters. Interactions between the two factors did not give any significant effect on all parameter. To produce the same drying level on the same product size, solar drying method is faster than natural one. To reach dry wood with 14 % moisture content in solar drying method, sortimen papan and usuk needs 23 and 26. 8 drying days respectively, while in natural drying method, the same product size needs 44. 6 and 48. 50 days of drying respectively...|$|R
30|$|As can be {{realized}} in Fig.  6, the effective water diffusivity increases with increasing of the local moisture content, and this result was also obtained by other researchers such as Silva et al. [5] studying osmotic dehydration of guava, and Olek and Weres [12] describing lumber drying. In addition, Fig.  6 indicates that the effective mass diffusivity for model 2 D is moderately greater than this property obtained with 3 D model. On the other hand, the effective mass diffusivity for model 1 D is significantly greater than this property for model 2 D and, consequently, for model 3 D. The interpretation of this result can be given with basis in Fig.  3, which shows the <b>dimensions</b> of the <b>lumber</b> and the moisture fluxes at the three visible surfaces of the parallelepiped during drying. For the 3 D case, the moisture flux occurs in three pairs of surfaces, involving the total area of 209840  mm 2. For the 2 D case, the pair of moisture fluxes at direction z was disregarded. Thus, the area involved in the moisture flux was 202640  mm 2, representing about 97  % of the total area for the 3 D case. For the 1 D case, the pair of moisture fluxes at direction y was also disregarded. Consequently, with these considerations, the moisture flux occurs in an area equal to 149000  mm 2, which represents only about 71  % of the area for the 3 D case. As it is observed, the great reduction in area when models 3 D or 2 D are substituted by model 1 D explains the significant increasing in its effective mass diffusivity, {{as it can be}} seen in Fig.  6. On the other hand, the small reduction in area when model 3 D is substituted by model 2 D explains the little difference in their effective mass diffusivities. An inspection of Table  1 enables to conclude that similar results are also obtained for the convective mass transfer coefficients for the cases one-, two- and three-dimensional.|$|R

[...] in [...] "Notes on Sculpture 4: Beyond Objects", originally published in Artforum, 1969, continuing to say that [...] "indeterminacy of arrangement of parts is a literal aspect of the physical existence of the thing." [...] The general shift in theory of which this essay is an expression suggests the transitions into what would later be referred to as postminimalism.One of the first artists specifically associated with minimalism was the painter, Frank Stella, whose early [...] "pinstripe" [...] paintings were included in the 1959 show, 16 Americans, organized by Dorothy Miller at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The width of the stripes in Frank Stellass pinstripe paintings were determined by the <b>dimensions</b> of the <b>lumber</b> used for stretchers, visible as the depth of the painting when viewed from the side, used to construct the supportive chassis upon which the canvas was stretched. The decisions about structures on the front surface of the canvas were therefore not entirely subjective, but pre-conditioned by a [...] "given" [...] feature of the physical construction of the support. In the show catalog, Carl Andre noted, [...] "Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint s. There is nothing else in his painting." [...] These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently highly subjective and emotionally charged paintings of Willem de Kooning or Franz Kline and, in terms of precedent among the previous generation of abstract expressionists, leaned more toward the less gestural, often somber, color field paintings of Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko. Although Stella received immediate attention from the MoMA show, artists including Kenneth Noland, Gene Davis, Robert Motherwell and Robert Ryman had also begun to explore stripes, monochromatic and Hard-edge formats from the late 50s through the 1960s.|$|R
