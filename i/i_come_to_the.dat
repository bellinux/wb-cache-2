I mark out the metre in dots and dashes, and not until I have quite settled on the rhythm do I proceed to actual notation." [...] Sullivan's text setting, {{compared with that of}} his 19th century English predecessors or his European contemporaries, was [...] "vastly more sensitive. ... Sullivan's operatic style attempts to create for itself a uniquely English text-music synthesis", and, in addition, by adopting a conservative musical style, he was able to achieve [...] "the clarity to match Gilbert's finely honed wit with musical wit of his own." ...|$|E
500|$|However, MacFarlane {{was criticized}} for his {{portrayal}} of transsexualism in the Family Guy episode [...] "Quagmire's Dad". Gay novelist Brent Hartinger found the episode's inclusion of transphobic remarks from Peter and Lois Griffin — {{as well as a}} scene of Brian vomiting profusely upon discovering his new girlfriend to be Glenn Quagmire's father – to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that the man is pretty much a complete idiot". The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, a LGBT media watchdog organization, shared [...] "serious concerns being voiced from members of the community" [...] about the episode. MacFarlane said he was [...] "surprised" [...] by the negative reaction to [...] "Quagmire's Dad", saying that [...] "it seemed that [...] were not picking up on {{the fact that it was}} a very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He further added, [...] "Look, Brian happens to be a heterosexual character, as I am. If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} criticized for its {{portrayal}} of people who identify as transgender, particularly regarding the way Ida was treated by other characters. Food that Ida prepared for the dinner party at the Griffin house was thrown out and Brian's learning of her sex-reassignment surgery after {{he had sex with}} her caused him to [...] "violently" [...] vomit for 30 unbroken seconds. Speaking with LGBT media website AfterElton.com in January 2010, series creator Seth MacFarlane mentioned the episode in response to concerns over how his animated series have portrayed LGBT characters. [...] "It always distresses me when I hear that the gay community is upset with us, because that's one group of people I hope would know we're on their side. I can safely say that the transsexual community will be very, very happy with the 'Quagmire' episode that we have coming up in a couple of months. It's probably the most sympathetic portrayal of a transexual [...] character that has ever been on television, dare I say." [...] In a subsequent review, AfterElton.com writer Brent Hartinger graded the episode negatively. While noting that the episode deserves credit for making important points about transgender people, he found its inclusion of the vomiting scene and Lois and Peter's transphobic remarks about Ida to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that the man is pretty much a complete idiot." [...] The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, an LGBT media watchdog organization, released a statement about the episode, noting that [...] "GLAAD shares the serious concerns being voiced from members of the community and GLAAD’s Entertainment Media Team is addressing these with Fox. Next steps will be decided at that point." [...] In a September 2010 interview in Details, MacFarlane expressed surprise at the negative reaction, stating [...] "I don't meet a lot of stupid homosexuals." [...] He repeated that he still felt Ida was a [...] "very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He also defended Brian's vomiting after discovering he had sex with someone who had undergone sex reassignment surgery noting Brian's character is heterosexual and [...] "If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up {{in the same way that}} a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'"
