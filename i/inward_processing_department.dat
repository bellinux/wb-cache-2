Thereby, it distinguishes between size, relative factor endowment, (other) cost factors and infrastructure variables. Using a large panel of bilateral processing trade flows of the EU 12 countries at the aggregate level over the period 1988 – 1999, we find that infrastructure variables, relative factor endowments and other cost variables are important determinants for the EU's outward processing trade.

40|$|With an {{increasing}} international trade, a {{more and more}} significant expansion was experienced by combined commercial operations, also including goods processing transactions. The expansion of these international economic affairs had as motivation the multiple direct and indirect positive effects they produce both at micro and macro level, such as: obtaining a significant commercial profit and on this basis, increasing the currency contribution, increasing the general indicator of the international trade volume, relieving the balance of external payments of certain payments in currency, making optimum use of production capacity and labour force etc. Given {{the complexity of the}} combined commercial operations of foreign trade, in this article we shall address the commercial transactions of <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> of foreign goods in terms of accounting models specific for conducting these transactions. In this regard, after the theoretical delimitation of these operations we shall emphasize the benefits of <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> of foreign goods but also without forgetting the limitations of these international commercial operations. To develop accounting models we shall first clarify the tax matters that affect the entry in the accounts of <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> of foreign goods, then we shall proceed to their reflection in accounting starting from a case study, if the recipient of such operations is based in the extra-community or community area. Thus {{we will be able to}} identify the conditions that the entities must meet in order to use as little cash money, the affecting fiscal conditions and the reflection in accounting of <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> of foreign goods.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} impacts of an export {{promotion}} policy, namely the <b>Inward</b> <b>Processing</b> Regime, on Turkish trade, employment and competitiveness. Several trade indices as well as descriptive statistics are {{used to assess the}} effects of the regime for the period of 2002 - 2014. It is concluded that its implementation has not been effective more than the average progress in trade flows, employment and competitiveness. There is no clear evidence that Turkish exporters use the regime in order to avoid customs taxes and trade remedies. By reducing the cost of imported inputs with world prices and providing them in a timely manner, the regime places Turkish exporters on an equal footing with others in third countries. In addition, thanks to this regime Turkish businesses, in order to sell good quality products to the world, can reach raw materials, semi-manufactured products or high technology equipment that cannot be provided from the domestic market and that are necessary for an ambitious manufacturing process. Therefore, the application of <b>Inward</b> <b>Processing</b> Regime should be continued as a complementary part of the global supply chain. <b>Inward</b> <b>Processing</b> Regime; Export Incentives; Competitiveness; Competitiveness Indice...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{research that}} was conducted into {{the potential of}} modeling {{the activities of the}} Data <b>Processing</b> <b>Department</b> as an aid to the computer auditor. A methodology is composed to aid in the evaluation of the Internal Controls, particularly the General Controls relative to computer processing. Consisting of three major components, the methodology enables the auditor to model the presumed activities of the Data <b>Processing</b> <b>Department</b> against the actual activities, as recorded on the Operating System Log. The first component of the methodology is the construction and loading of a model of the presumed activities of the Data <b>Processing</b> <b>Department</b> from its verbal, scheduled, and reported activities. The second component is the generation of a description of the actual activities of the Data <b>Processing</b> <b>Department</b> from the information recorded on the Operating System Log. This is effected by reducing the Operating System Log to the format described by the Standard Audit File concept. Finally, the third component in the methodology is the modeling process itself. This is in fact a new analysis technique proposed for use by the EDP auditor. The modeling process is composed of software that compares the model developed and loaded in the first component, with the description of actual activity as collated by the second component. Results from this comparison are then reviewed by the auditor, who determines if they adequately depict the situation, or whether the models description as specified in the first component requires to be altered, and the modeling process re-initiated. In conducting the research, information and data from a production installation was used. Use of the ‘real-world’ input proved both the feasibility of developing a model of the reported activities of the Data <b>Processing</b> <b>Department,</b> and the adequacy of the operating system log as a source of information to report the departments actual activities. Additionally, it enabled the involvement and comment of practicing auditors. The research involved analysis of the effect of EDP on the audit process, structure of the EDP audit process, data reduction, data structures, model formalization, and model processing software. Additionally, the Standard Audit File concept was verified through its use by practising auditors, and expanded by the development of an indexed data structure, which enabled its analysis to be conducted interactively. Results from the trial implementation of the research software and methodology at a production installation confirmed the research hypothesis that the activities of the Data <b>Processing</b> <b>Department</b> could be modelled, and that there are substantial benefits from the EDP auditor in analysing this process. The research in fact provides a new source of information, and develops a new analysis technique for the EDP auditor. It demonstrates the utilization of computer technology to monitor itself for the audit function, and reasserts auditor independence by providing access to technical detail describing the processing activities of the computer...|$|R

The study showed that because the technology was largely under end user control, better tailored information systems resulted and system output was more directly used by middle and top managers. This only occurred, however, if certain moderators, such as computing and modelling skills, were present in functional departments. DDP also offers opportunities for better relationships with data <b>processing</b> <b>departments</b> but the consequences include the need for better management training and functional support groups for systems implementation.

In the downstairs deposit <b>processing</b> <b>department,</b> image <b>processing</b> led to the substitution of computers for high school educated labor in accomplishing core tasks and in greater specialization in the jobs that remained. In the upstairs exceptions <b>processing</b> <b>department,</b> image <b>processing</b> led to the integration of tasks, with an associated increase in the demand for particular skills. The case illustrates the interdependence of technological change and organizational change. It suggests that seeing the whole picture' and associated conceptual and problem-solving skills are made more valuable by information technologies. Finally, it underscores that the short-term consequences of technological changes may depend importantly on regulatory forces. ...|$|R

A flexible layout is one that maintains low material handling costs despite fluctuations in the product demand levels. We extend existing procedures for design of flexible layouts by (1) explicitly capturing the stochastic nature of product demands and the resulting variability in material flows between different <b>processing</b> <b>departments,</b> (2) allowing for the possibility of multiple <b>processing</b> <b>departments</b> of the same type to exist in the same facility, and (3) letting material flows between pairs of individual departments be determined simultaneously with the layout and as a function of demand scenarios.
