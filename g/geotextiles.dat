5|$|The {{detailed}} {{design for the}} project was completed during summer 2006 and construction began in January 2007. The first task was to build a stable access road, but the moor was covered in a layer of peat with a low load-bearing capacity. The whole area had also been subjected to extensive coal mining during the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{so there was a}} potential for subsidence. To address these problems, the mining voids were grouted and a floating road was constructed, using a complex system of <b>geotextiles</b> and geogrids to prevent the road from sinking. This was achieved by laying a crushed-gravel base, reinforced with polyester and polypropylene grids, to bridge any potential mine voids and ensure that the weak shear strength of the subsoil was exceeded by the base course material.|$|E

25|$|<b>Geo{{textiles}}</b> {{form one}} of the two largest groups of geosynthetics. They are textiles consisting of synthetic fibers rather than natural ones such as cotton, wool, or silk. This makes them less susceptible to bio-degradation. These synthetic fibers are made into flexible, porous fabrics by standard weaving machinery or are matted together in a random non woven manner. Some are also knitted. <b>Geotextiles</b> are porous to liquid flow across their manufactured plane and also within their thickness, but to a widely varying degree. There are at least 100 specific application areas for <b>geotextiles</b> that have been developed; however, the fabric always performs at least one of four discrete functions: separation, reinforcement, filtration, and/or drainage.|$|E

25|$|A {{geocomposite}} {{consists of}} a combination of <b>geotextiles,</b> geogrids, geonets and/or geomembranes in a factory fabricated unit.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Interface {{friction}} between woven <b>geotextile</b> and sand was investigated using pullout tests on <b>geotextile</b> widths 76 mm to 305 mm and embedment depths 305 mm to 1219 mm. Previously reported research indicated that in pullout tests the interface resistance between <b>geotextile</b> and sand decreased as {{the width of}} the embedment increased. For embedment depths up to 610 mm the <b>geotextile</b> behaved like an anchor and at failure a mass of soil surrounding the <b>geotextile</b> was uplifted as in uplift tests of footings. From geometry of the uplifted soil it was possible to show that the pullout stress developed on <b>geotextile</b> face was the same regardless of its width. Failure occurred at geotextile-soil interface for embedment of 915 mm or more and the pullout stress decreased with increasing embedment depth. ...|$|R

25|$|Drainage is the {{equilibrium}} soil-to-geosynthetic {{system that allows}} for adequate liquid flow without soil loss, within {{the plane of the}} geosynthetic over a service lifetime compatible with the application under consideration. Geopipe highlights this function, and also geonets, geocomposites and very thick <b>geotextiles.</b> Drainage applications for these different geosynthetics are retaining walls, sport fields, dams, canals, reservoirs, and capillary breaks. Also to be noted is that sheet, edge and wick drains are geocomposites used for various soil and rock drainage situations.|$|E
25|$|Geonets, and {{the related}} geospacers by some, {{constitute}} another specialized segment within the geosynthetics area. They are formed by a continuous extrusion of parallel sets of polymeric ribs at acute angles to one another. When the ribs are opened, relatively large apertures are formed into a netlike configuration. Two types are most common, either biplanar or triplanar. Alternatively many very different types of drainage cores are available. They consist of nubbed, dimpled or cuspated polymer sheets, three-dimensional networks of stiff polymer fibers in different configurations and small drainage pipes or spacers within <b>geotextiles.</b> Their design function is completely within the drainage area where {{they are used to}} convey liquids or gases of all types.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Three {{different}} types of heat-bonded, needle-punched, nonwoven polyester <b>geotextile</b> specimens with similar hydraulic conductivities, but with different O 90 values and average pore opening sizes, were exposed to a 3. 6 m head of cattle manure slurry con-taining 7. 5 % total solids (TS) in laboratory columns to test the effect of pore opening size on <b>geotextile</b> specimen clogging. <b>Geotextile</b> specimens, with the smallest pore openings, were also exposed to 1, 2, and 4 % TS cattle manure slurries to test the sealing effect of the TS.

40|$|Threats to beaches have {{accelerated}} the coastal destruction. In recent decades, <b>geotextile</b> tubes were used {{around the world}} to prevent coastal erosion, to encourage beach nourishment, and to assist mangrove rehabilitation. However, the applications of <b>geotextile</b> tube in sandy and muddy coasts have different concerns as the geological settings are different. Applications of <b>geotextile</b> tubes in sandy beaches were mainly to prevent coastline from further erosion and to nourish the beach. However, for the muddy coasts, mangrove rehabilitation and conservation were additional concerns in coastal management schemes. The mangrove forests are natural barriers which {{can be found on the}} muddy coasts of many tropical countries. In this paper, the viability of <b>geotextile</b> tubes in sandy and muddy beaches was analysed. The advantages and disadvantages of the utilization of <b>geotextile</b> tubes in coastal management were discussed based on the experiences from the tropical countries such as Mexico, Malaysia, and Thailand. From the case studies, impressive improvements in coastal restoration after installation of <b>geotextile</b> tubes were shown. Based on the discussion, several recommendations to improve the application of <b>geotextile</b> tubes were suggested in this paper...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFlexible <b>geotextile</b> {{structures}} {{are widely used}} in coastal engineering, such as <b>geotextile</b> mattress used in bottom protection engineering and sand-filled <b>geotextile</b> tube used in reclamation project. This kind of structure can adapt to varying bathymetry condition quite well and has significant engineering effect, but when the sediment under the structure was eroded and cavity occurs, this <b>geotextile</b> material may be ripped at continuous wave action, especially in the shallow water zone. However, the failure mechanism is still not clear. The dynamic response of <b>geotextile</b> structure in regular waves was firstly studied. In order to study tensile stress in the <b>geotextile</b> structures caused by wave, a series of 2 -D physical models were designed. Under a selected <b>geotextile</b> structure condition, numbers of tensile force sensor were addicted {{around the edge of}} the <b>geotextile</b> material, and then fixed at the bottom of the wave flume. By changing wave parameter and water depth, the relationship between tensile stress and wave parameters were obtained and discussed. It turns out that the tensile force detected in the experiment is much less than the upper limit of material's tensile strength, which means that the <b>geotextile</b> may not be easily damaged just by the tensile stress caused by waves. It is suggested that the structure may break out due to abrasion between the structure and the internal material. Details of the discussion on the experimental data will be presented...|$|R
25|$|Geomembranes {{represent}} the other {{largest group of}} geosynthetics, and in dollar volume their sales are {{greater than that of}} <b>geotextiles.</b> Their growth in the United States and Germany was stimulated by governmental regulations originally enacted in the early 1980s for the lining of solid-waste landfills. The materials themselves are relatively thin, impervious sheets of polymeric material used primarily for linings and covers of liquids- or solid-storage facilities. This includes all types of landfills, surface impoundments, canals, and other containment facilities. Thus the primary function is always containment as a liquid or vapor barrier or both. The range of applications, however, is great, and in addition to the environmental area, applications are rapidly growing in geotechnical, transportation, hydraulic, and private development engineering (such as aquaculture, agriculture, heap leach mining, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Geocells (also {{known as}} Cellular Confinement Systems) are {{three-dimensional}} honeycombed cellular structures that form a confinement system when infilled with compacted soil. Extruded from polymeric materials into strips welded together ultrasonically in series, the strips are expanded {{to form the}} stiff (and typically textured and perforated) walls of a flexible 3D cellular mattress. Infilled with soil, a new composite entity is created from the cell-soil interactions. The cellular confinement reduces the lateral movement of soil particles, thereby maintaining compaction and forms a stiffened mattress that distributes loads over a wider area. Traditionally used in slope protection and earth retention applications, geocells made from advanced polymers are being increasingly adopted for long-term road and rail load support. Much larger geocells are also made from stiff <b>geotextiles</b> sewn into similar, but larger, unit cells that are used for protection bunkers and walls.|$|E
25|$|Reinforcement is the {{synergistic}} {{improvement of}} a total system’s strength created {{by the introduction of}} a geotextile, geogrid or geocell (all of which are good in tension) into a soil (that is good in compression, but poor in tension) or other disjointed and separated material. Applications of this function are in mechanically stabilized and retained earth walls and steep soil slopes; they can be combined with masonry facings to create vertical retaining walls. Also involved is the application of basal reinforcement over soft soils and over deep foundations for embankments and heavy surface loadings. Stiff polymer geogrids and geocells {{do not have to be}} held in tension to provide soil reinforcement, unlike <b>geotextiles.</b> Stiff 2D geogrid and 3D geocells interlock with the aggregate particles and the reinforcement mechanism is one of confinement of the aggregate.
