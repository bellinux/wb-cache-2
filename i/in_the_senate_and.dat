5|$|As {{the only}} member from a seceded state to remain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> the most {{prominent}} Southern Unionist, Johnson had Lincoln's ear {{in the early months}} of the war. With most of Tennessee in Confederate hands, Johnson spent congressional recesses in Kentucky and Ohio, trying in vain to convince any Union commander who would listen to conduct an operation into East Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Marking Specter's {{entire career}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and,</b> indeed, {{in all his}} public offices was one {{overriding}} fact: First and foremost, he considered himself essentially a trial attorney rather than a professional politician. During his tenures on Senate committees, his approach to their hearings was very similar to courtroom examinations of trial witnesses.|$|E

5|$|On March 5, 1868, the {{impeachment}} trial began <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> lasted almost three months; Congressmen George S.

5|$|Chandler's mentor Harry F.

In 1943, he was part of a five-person delegation from the Military Affairs Committee that traveled the world, inspecting U.S. military bases. He vociferously disagreed with Roosevelt's decision to prioritize European operations in World War II over the war in the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Ford seriously {{considered}} leaving the Senate and {{running for governor}} again in 1983 and 1991, but decided against it both times. In the 1983 contest, he would have faced sitting lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins in the primary. Collins was a factional ally of Ford's, which influenced his decision. In 1991, Ford cited his seniority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> desire to become Democratic Senate whip as factors in his decision not to run for governor.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Tydings–Butler race, McCarthy campaigned for several other Republicans in the 1950 elections, including Everett Dirksen against Democratic incumbent and Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas. Dirksen, and indeed all the candidates McCarthy supported, won their elections, and those he opposed lost. The elections, including many that McCarthy was not involved in, were an overall Republican sweep. Although his impact on the elections was unclear, McCarthy was credited as a key Republican campaigner. He was now {{regarded as one of}} the most powerful men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> was treated with new-found deference by his colleagues.|$|E

5|$|In early 1957, Nixon {{undertook}} {{another major}} foreign trip, {{this time to}} Africa. On his return, he helped shepherd the Civil Rights Act of 1957 through Congress. The bill was weakened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> <b>and</b> civil rights leaders were divided over whether Eisenhower should sign it. Nixon advised the President to sign the bill, which he did. Eisenhower suffered a mild stroke in November 1957, and Nixon gave a press conference, assuring the nation that the Cabinet was functioning well as a team during Eisenhower's brief illness.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's role as {{a liberal}} lion in the Senate {{came to the fore}} in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and {{legislation}} intending to fulfill the Contract with America was coming from Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives. Many Democrats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> the country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans. By the beginning of 1996, the Republicans had overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass the Senate and the Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it coming out of Kennedy's staff.|$|E
5|$|Mathias {{was elected}} to the Senate in 1968, {{unseating}} the incumbent Democrat, Daniel Brewster, who twenty years earlier had been his roommate while attending the University of Maryland School of Law. He continued his record as a liberal Republican <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> <b>and</b> frequently clashed with the conservative wing of his party. For a few months in late 1975 and early 1976, Mathias considered running an insurgent presidential campaign in an attempt to stave off the increasing influence of conservative Republicans led by Ronald Reagan.|$|E

5|$|Minton was {{a fierce}} {{partisan}} {{during his time}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> <b>and</b> regularly abused his opponents verbally. Democratic Senator Huey Long became one of Minton's favorite targets because of Long's often-threatened filibusters. During one of the filibusters, Long threatened to join the Republican Party. After most senators had left the chamber, Minton remained for several hours to periodically taunt Long. After tiring of the taunts, Long launched a rebuttal from the podium, calling Minton a vicious politician whose positions would cost Minton re-election. The exchange was unusual for its tone and later made national news.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{stood for}} the Senate at the 1901 federal {{election}} in March and {{was elected in}} the fourth position, with 40% of the vote (electors cast six votes, with the six candidates with the highest totals winning election). The only Protectionist Senator from New South Wales, he was appointed Leader of the Government <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> <b>and</b> {{was instrumental in the}} evolution of that house as subordinate to the House of Representatives, although he encouraged the introduction of legislation into the Senate.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Prime Minister Holt {{vanished}} while {{swimming in}} rough seas near Melbourne; his body was never recovered. John McEwen, {{as leader of the}} junior Coalition partner, the Country Party, took over as prime minister for three weeks until the Liberals could elect a new leader. Senator John Gorton won the vote and became prime minister. The leadership campaign was conducted mostly by television, and Gorton appeared to have the visual appeal needed to keep Whitlam out of office. Gorton resigned his seat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> <b>and</b> in February 1968 won the by-election for Holt's seat of Higgins in Victoria. For the remainder of the year, Gorton appeared to have the better of Whitlam in the House of Representatives. In his chronicle of the Whitlam years, however, speechwriter Graham Freudenberg asserts that Gorton's erratic behaviour, Whitlam's strengthening of his party, and events outside Australia (such as the Vietnam War) ate away at Liberal dominance.|$|E
5|$|Barkley, {{recently}} {{chosen as}} Senate Majority Leader {{by a single}} vote, was {{a strong supporter of}} President Roosevelt and the New Deal. Chandler identified with the more conservative southern Democrats who, wary of Roosevelt and his New Deal, sought to gain control of the party ahead of the 1940 presidential election. Because Roosevelt was very popular in Kentucky, Chandler was put in the awkward position of expressing personal support of the president while opposing his hand-picked leader <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> his New Deal legislation. In April, polls showed Barkley ahead of Chandler by a 2-to-1 margin, and the May 3 primary victory of New Deal Florida Senator Claude Pepper finally persuaded Chandler to abandon his attacks of the program.|$|E
5|$|In Belgium, {{political}} {{debate about the}} Royal Question continued and grew after the war, and remained a polemical topic in the popular press, notably in the Francophone newspaper Le Soir. In the general election of 1949, the PSC–CVP campaigned on a pro-Leopold royalist platform. The results reshaped the political landscape; the Communists were routed and the PSB–BSP lost seats to both the Liberals and Catholics. The Catholics gained a new majority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> a plurality in the Chamber of Representatives, their best results since the war. Gaston Eyskens took over as Prime Minister {{at the head of}} a Liberal-Catholic coalition. Both parties in the government (and Leopold himself) supported a referendum on the King's return, which became the focus of political attention.|$|E
