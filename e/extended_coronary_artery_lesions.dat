This is an observational cross-sectional study. Data were collected from January to May 2014 in Dr. Hasan Sadikin Central General Hospital Bandung. Blood samples were collected before angiography procedures. The complexity of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesion</b> was assessed using SYNTAX score. There were 44 patients who met inclusion criteria, male 84 %, median age 54. 68 (+ 10. 24) years. Mean body mass index 24. 71 (+ 3. 05) kg/m 2. Dyslipidemia was the most common risk factor (84 %), followed by smoking (72 %), hypertension (38. 4 %), diabetes mellitus (22. 7 %), and obesity (4. 5 %). Median leptin level was 7, 242 (780 - 36, 929) pq/mL. Mean SYNTAX score was 19. 52 (+ 9. 93). Leptin level had no correlation with the complexity of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesion</b> (p= 0. 61, r= 0. 078).

40|$|Kawasaki {{disease is}} an acute {{inflammatory}} syndrome {{that takes the}} form of systemic vasculitis, and predominantly affects children. Important complications of this disease are <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> dilation and aneurysm formation. Recent studies indicate that Kawasaki disease patients have elevated expression, activity, or protein levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and suggest that imbalances in MMPs or MMP/tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP) play important pathophysiological roles in the development of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions</b> in this disease. However, it remains unclear whether MMP activities at the site of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions</b> are indeed increased. Further studies on the effects of MMP inhibition on coronary outcome are needed to define the roles of MMPs and TIMPs in the formation of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions</b> in Kawasaki disease; findings of such studies may support the use of MMP inhibitors for the prevention of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> complications in patients with this disease...|$|R

However, the pressure guidewire used in obtaining FFR measurements is difficult to control and manipulate in certain complex <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions,</b> resulting in increased fluoroscopy time and contrast dye usage. This study examined a novel (NOV) technique for obtaining FFR measurements in hope of easing the difficulties associated with evaluating and treating complex <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions.</b> Methods: Fifty-six patients with complex <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions</b> were assigned to a conventional (CON) FFR technique group or a NOV FFR technique group.

The children were classified into one of two groups: Group I comprised 55 children with KD and coronary aneurysms; Group 2 comprised 64 children with KD and normal <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries.</b> The relationship between hs-CRP concentration and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and the size of arterial lesions was investigated in Group I 1 year after onset of KD. ResultsSerum hs-CRP levels in Group I (mean, 0. 251 mg/dL) were significantly greater than those in Group II (mean, 0. 162 mg/dL; p = 0. 011). However, plasma HDL-C levels in Group I (mean 42. 51 mg/dL) were significantly lower than those in Group II (mean, 44. 34 mg/dL; p = 0. 037). In Group I, there was a positive association between hs-CRP and the size of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions</b> (r = 0. 672, p = 0. 035), but no association between lipid profiles, including HDL-C, and <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions</b> (all p > 0. 05).

We compared balloon angioplasty with directional atherectomy for early and 6 -month results for ostial as well as nonostial proximal left anterior descending <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions.</b> Results. Directional atherectomy led to an initially higher gain in minimal lumen diameter for ostial lesions (1. 13 vs. 0. 56 mm, respectively, p < 0. 001) but a higher rate of adjudicated non-Q wave myocardial infarction (24 % vs. 13 %, respectively, p < 0. 001) than balloon angioplasty and no improvement in restenosis rates (48 % vs. 46 %, respectively). In the nonostial proximal left anterior descending <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions,</b> angiographic restenosis was reduced (51 % vs. 66 %, p = 0. 012), but this was also associated with a higher rate of periprocedural myocardial infarction (8 % vs. 2 %, p = 0. 008 by site and 24 % vs. 8 %, p < 0. 001 by adjudication) and no difference in the need for subsequent <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass surgery (7. 3 % vs. 8. 4 %, respectively) or repeat percutaneous coronary intervention (24 % vs. 26 %, respectively). Conclusions. For ostial left anterior descending <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> stenoses, both procedures yielded similar rates of initial success and restenosis, but atherectomy was associated with more non-Q wave myocardial infarction.

Background. Aortic root angiography and myocardial perfusion imaging yield ambiguous results regarding {{the fate of the}} <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> anastomoses after the arterial switch operation. Late death related to <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> obstruction and growth of the translocated <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> are of major concern in these patients. Methods. Selective <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> angiography was performed prospectively in a total of 165 children. Results. A total of 12 coronary occlusions, 8 major stenoses, 6 minor stenoses of the left ostium and 4 stretchings of one <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> were identified. Obstructions were more frequent in types D and E (p < 0. 001) of the Yacoub and Radley-Smith classification. Coronary obstruction was documented in all patients with electrocardiographic and ultrasound evidence of myocardial ischemia at time of study. Early postoperative ischemia did not predict <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesion</b> if the patient had fully recovered. Persistent or delayed myocardial ischemia was highly predictive of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions.</b> The incidence of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> obstruction was very high (11 of 35) in patients operated on by a rapidly abandoned technique of single-orifice reimplantation of both <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> ostia.

ResultsAt 3 years, major adverse cardiac events had occurred in 20 patients (12 %) in the SES group and in 59 patients (38 %) in the BMS group (p < 0. 001). Four versus 2 patients suffered a cardiac death (p = NS), and 5 versus 1 died of a noncardiac disease (p = NS) in the SES versus the BMS group. Six patients in the SES group versus 15 patients in the BMS group suffered a myocardial infarction (p < 0. 05) during the 3 -year observation period, and target lesion revascularization was performed in 8 patients (4. 9 %) versus 53 patients (33. 8 %), respectively (p < 0. 001); of these, 4 in the SES versus 7 in the BMS group were performed between 1 and 3 years after the index treatment (p = NS). According to revised definitions, stent thrombosis occurred in 5 patients (3. 1 %) in the SES group and in 7 patients (4. 4 %) in the BMS group (p = NS); very late stent thrombosis was observed in 4 versus 1 patient.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyze the severity of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions</b> and the prognosis of thyroid dysfunction patients admitted for coronary angiography (CAG). MethodsFrom July 2011 to July 2012, 605 consecutive patients with suspected coronary heart disease admitted for CAG were selected. The patients were divided into three groups, based on their thyroid function prior to CAG: euthyroid group (n= 455 patients), low T 3 syndrome group (n= 96 patients), and hypothyroidism group (n= 54 patients). All patients underwent CAG. Then the severity of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions</b> was assessed by Gensini scores. All patients were followed up for major adverse cardiac events. ResultsThe prevalence of CHD in low T 3 syndrome group and hypothyroidism group was significantly higher than that in the euthyroid group (p< 0. 001 and p= 0. 004, respectively). Moreover, the severity of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions</b> in low T 3 syndrome group and hypothyroidism group was significantly greater than that in the euthyroid group (all p< 0. 001). Multinomial logistic regression analysis demonstrated that low T 3 syndrome was an independent risk factor of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> moderate [odds ratio (OR) = 4. 268, 95 % CI: 3. 294 – 7. 450, p= 0. 016] and severe (OR= 4. 294, 95 % CI: 2. 259 – 9. 703, p< 0. 001) lesions. The mean duration of follow-up was 15. 3 ± 3. 8 months; patients with thyroid dysfunction had a significantly worse prognosis as compared to those in the euthyroid group for the composite end-point (p< 0. 01).

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{ultrasound}} features of carotid atherosclerosis and its predicting value for coronary heart disease. Methods: A total of 55 cases {{of patients with}} coronary heart disease were selected as coronary heart disease group, 55 cases of healthy subjects were selected as control group, carotid artery ultrasound was used to detect intima-media thickness and judge the degree of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesion,</b> and plasma was collected to detect blood lipid metabolism indicators (FFA, LDL-C and HDL-C) and inflammation indicators (CCL 21, CCR 7, sCD 40 L, MFG-E 8 and IL- 10). Results: Carotid artery IMT of CHD group {{was significantly higher than}} that of control group, and the more the number of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions,</b> the higher the IMT; plasma FFA, LDL-C, CCL 21, CCR 7 and sCD 40 L content of CHD group were higher than those of control group, and HDL-C, MFG-E 8 and IL- 10 content as well as HDL-C/ LDL-C ratio were lower than those of control group; blood lipid metabolism indicators and inflammation indicators of coronary heart disease patients with different IMT were different, and the thicker the IMT, the higher the plasma FFA, LDL-C, CCL 21, CCR 7 and sCD 40 L content, the lower the HDL-C, MFG-E 8 and IL- 10 content as well as HDL-C/LDL-C ratio. Conclusion: Carotid artery IMT of patients with coronary heart disease significantly thickens and can assess the number of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions,</b> blood lipid metabolism and degree of inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the correlation between}} multiple cardiovascular risk factors and the severity of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions</b> in young patients(age ≤ 45 years). Methods One thousand one hundred and thirty-seven patients who had undergone coronary angiography were selected according to founded criteria. Of them 494 were diagnosed as <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease(CAD group) and 643 as non-CAD(non-CAD group) by angiography. The difference of the risk factors between the two groups,and the characteristics of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions</b> revealed by the severity of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> lesion,Gensini cumulative score,and number of stenosed <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> branches,were analyzed. Results Obvious {{differences were found between}} the two groups in regard to sex ratio,incidence of hypertension,type II diabetes and obesity,and the habit of smoking and drinking. Logistic regression analysis showed that type II diabetes was the most significant predictor for the extent and severity of CAD in young patients,followed by hypertension and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol(LDL-C). The serum level of total bilirubin was the protective factor of CAD. Conclusion The most important independent risk factor for CAD in young patients is type II diabetes mellitus,and the independent protective factor is the serum level of total bilirubin...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} {{demonstrate}} the safety and feasibility of an integrated coronary revascularization strategy that combines minimally invasive left internal thoracic artery to left anterior descending <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> anastomosis with drug-eluting stent implantation to non-left anterior descending <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions.</b> MethodsOver 18 months, 47 consecutive patients with multivessel <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease underwent thoracoscopic harvesting of the left internal thoracic artery to graft the left anterior descending <b>coronary</b> <b>artery.</b> Anastomoses were constructed by hand, off-pump, and under direct vision through a 4 -cm non–rib-spreading, muscle-sparing chest incision. Non-left anterior descending <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>lesions</b> were then treated percutaneously using sirolimus- or paclitaxel-eluting stents. Angiographic follow-up was performed in all patients. ResultsWithin the first 90 days of hospitalizations, there were no deaths, myocardial infarctions, neurologic events, or wound complications. Forty patients underwent left internal thoracic artery to left anterior descending <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> grafting, and 7 patients underwent left internal thoracic artery to left anterior descending coronary artery/diagonal sequential grafting {{for a total of}} 54 anastomoses. Angiographic patency scores were FitzGibbon A 96. 2 % (52 / 54) and FitzGibbon A + B 100 % (54 / 54). A total of 65 drug-eluting stents were implanted in 61 non-left anterior descending <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>lesions</b> of which 49. 1 % (30 / 61) were type B 2 or C lesions, including 5 left main lesions. Diabetes was present in 53. 2 % of patients (25 / 47). At a mean follow-up time of 7. 0 ± 4. 8 months, the target lesion or vessel repeat revascularization rate was 6. 6 % (4 / 61) for drug-eluting stents and 1. 9 % (1 / 54) for left internal thoracic artery to left anterior descending <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> grafting. One anastomosis required balloon dilation, but no patients have required repeat <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass grafting. ConclusionsIntegrated coronary revascularization using drug-eluting stents is feasible and safe. There are sufficient data to justify a randomized comparison of integrated coronary revascularization with standard <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass grafting...|$|R
