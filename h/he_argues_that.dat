5|$|Hadley has {{considered}} {{the ethics of}} humans' relationships with wild animals and environments beyond his property rights theory. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> there is a duty to aid wild animals in need, and that these duties are essentially no different to humans' duties to aid distant strangers who are severely cognitively impaired. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> libertarian property rights, consistent with Robert Nozick's interpretation of the Lockean proviso, should limit the right to destroy human-owned natural environments.|$|E
5|$|The {{folly of}} the First World War as {{a choice of}} policy; <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> the costs of modern war, direct and indirect, predictably {{exceeded}} the benefits of eliminating the Hohenzollerns.|$|E
5|$|Democratic transhumanists, such as American {{sociologist}} James Hughes, {{counter that}} many influential {{members of the}} United States Establishment are bioconservatives strongly opposed to human enhancement, as demonstrated by President Bush's Council on Bioethics's proposed international treaty prohibiting human cloning and germline engineering. Furthermore, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> conspiracy theorists underestimate how fringe the transhumanist movement really is.|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> in all {{countries}} and times, {{the distribution of}} income and wealth is highly skewed, with a few holding most of the wealth. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> all observed societies follow a regular logarithmic pattern: ...|$|R
50|$|On 13 February 2015, Kahraman {{attended}} a career's {{day at a}} girls' school in Rize. In his speech, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> students should avoid turning to fashion and instead be faithful and devout. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> students should {{follow the example of}} President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's mother, Tenzile Erdoğan.|$|R
50|$|Konrad {{admitted}} demonstrating {{his invention}} before the critical date without explicitly communicating to his audience {{that it was}} confidential. Regardless, Konrad <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> this demonstration {{does not meet the}} public use criteria for three reasons. First, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> because LBNL and the demonstration audience were both funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, the invention disclosure he made to the LBNL patent office before the demonstration allowed for an implicit expectation of confidentiality. Second, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the demonstration was an experiment and thus cannot be considered public use under legal precedent established in Baxter v. Cobe. Finally, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not disclose every limitation of his invention.|$|R
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> {{across the}} world, cannibals {{are viewed as}} {{non-human}} entities, committing acts that no human would ordinarily perpetrate. In this way they were akin to various non-human species of animal, and Arens notes that in some societies, cannibals are believed to physically transform into different species in order to kill and consume humans.|$|E
5|$|Sweden {{receives}} Booth's strongest criticism, where consumerist influences are {{blamed for}} the apparent downfall of the Nordic model of social democracy and recurrent failures of the Swedish justice system. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> Sweden, with its strict rules of social etiquette, has a strong culture of conformity.|$|E
5|$|Fairman {{discusses}} {{the efforts of}} conservatives in the United States to censor the word from common parlance in the country, and says these acts {{are opposed to the}} First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Fairman warns against a tendency toward self-censorship. He explains that those who choose to silence themselves tacitly encourage a process by which speech is forbidden through the legal process. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> this passivity has an impact of increasing the taboo nature of the word.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> all {{separation}} agreements {{should be}} binding, {{whether they are}} made before a marriage, after it, or once the marriage has already deteriorated. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the case for recognising prenuptial agreements has strengthened since {{it has come to}} be accepted that both parties to a marriage are to be treated equally.|$|R
5000|$|The Republican Minority Leader, John Boehner (R-Ohio), {{opposed the}} {{legislation}} from its introduction. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the DISCLOSE Act violated the First Amendment {{and that the}} bill is a scheme {{on the part of}} the majority to silence their opponents. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the legislation had fallen victim to back-room deals and special interest exemptions: ...|$|R
5000|$|Mosley {{detected}} a linear growth within British history {{and he saw}} Europe a Nation as the culmination of this destiny. Therefore, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> it was [...] "part of an organic process of British history", as Britain had united into one nation <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> it was Britain's national destiny to unite the whole continent.|$|R
5|$|He {{considers}} the forces such as surface tension acting on cells, and Plateau's experiments on soap films. He illustrates {{the way a}} splash breaks into droplets and compares this to the shapes of Campanularian zoophytes (Hydrozoa). He looks at the flask-like shapes of single-celled organisms such as species of Vorticella, considering teleological and physical explanations of their having minimal areas; and at the hanging drop shapes of some Foraminifera such as Lagena. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> the cells of trypanosomes are similarly shaped by surface tension.|$|E
5|$|James Morris {{notes that}} Hick's eschatological {{verification}} {{theory has been}} criticised for being inconsistent with his belief in religious pluralism. Morris argues that such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> even if some beliefs about life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in bodily resurrection can still be verified.|$|E
5|$|Sanders {{says that}} Jesus' mission {{was not about}} repentance, {{although}} he acknowledges that this opinion is unpopular. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> repentance appears as a strong theme only in Luke, that repentance was John the Baptist's message, and that Jesus' ministry {{would not have been}} scandalous if the sinners he ate with had been repentant. According to Theissen and Merz, Jesus taught that God was generously giving people an opportunity to repent.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} street-level {{bureaucracy}} was popularized by Michael Lipsky in 1980. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> [...] "policy implementation {{in the end}} {{comes down to the}} people who actually implement it". <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> state employees such as police and social workers should be seen as part of the [...] "policy-making community" [...] and as exercisers of political power.|$|R
500|$|Before the New York Court of Appeals, Fellows was {{represented}} by J. C. Spencer, who made three arguments. First, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the right {{to bring an action}} for trespass based on aboriginal title accrued only to an Indian nation, not an individual Indian. As Spencer noted, the Seneca Nation itself was prohibited by law from bringing an action [...] "by a private attorney." [...] Second, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Fellows' title was valid. Third, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the Seneca's rights under the treaty were only enforceable against the federal government, and did not affect the defendant's title as a condition precedent. The court reporter did not publish Martindale's responses.|$|R
25|$|On 3 February 1675, Shaftesbury wrote {{a letter}} to Carlisle in which <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the king needed to {{dissolve}} the Cavalier Parliament, which had been elected in early 1661, and call fresh elections. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> frequent parliamentary elections were {{in the best interest of}} both the crown and the people of England. This letter circulated widely in manuscript form.|$|R
5|$|Stones Bitter has {{suffered}} a decline in sales since the closure, {{and a member of}} the Bass board of directors that took the decision to close the brewery has admitted that, given the subsequent resurgence in golden ales and local provenance in beer, the decision to close the brewery was the wrong one. Retrospectively, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> Bass should have backed Stones over Worthington.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{intervention}} in Russia in 1918–19. He was indignant with Soviet accounts {{of a vast}} capitalist conspiracy against the world's first worker's state, some of which do not even mention the First World War; he was equally indignant with the decision to intervene as costly and harmful. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> the interventions, by arousing Russian nationalism, may have ensured {{the survival of the}} Bolshevik state.|$|E
5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E
5000|$|Steiner's {{early work}} {{focused on the}} {{phonology}} of Semitic languages, especially Hebrew. In one book <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the letter known as Hebrew sin was pronounced as a fricative-lateral and in another <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the pronunciation of the letter tsade as an affricate, /ts/, is very old and widespread, against others who had doubted this. [...] These books have convinced most specialists.|$|R

5|$|Arias-Maldonado {{argues that}} {{traditional}} {{appeals to the}} value of nonhuman animals have failed to be sufficiently motivating, and that, instead, human/nonhuman relationships are appropriately grounded upon the ideas of human exceptionalism and human domination. These notions, he claims, can be the basis of political transformation for nonhuman animals. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> once these ideas are properly understood, they can ground an idea of human sympathy for nonhuman animals, which is just one part of a caring and sustainable Anthropocene. Even if an alternative politics might ultimately be preferable, Arias-Maldonado argues, a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.|$|E
5|$|Boyer {{observes the}} {{distinction}} between how nonhuman animals can receive political protection {{as individuals and as}} species. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> the latter form of protection is motivated by a desire to preserve human experience of the species rather than the experiences of the nonhuman animals themselves. Politically motivated species advocacy, Boyer argues, is highly anthropocentric, as advocates present these animals as sharing in particular revered virtues; as a result, the likes of habitat and genetic health are the focus of advocates, rather than the nonhuman animals themselves. Using the example of polar bear preservation, Boyer illustrates how species advocacy becomes tied up with broader political goals concerning humans and competing visions of the value of animals. He concludes that the advancement of species advocacy can limit the achievement of animal welfare/rights goals.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane's own sympathies lie most {{strongly}} with utilitarianism and liberalism; {{his own account}} is most influenced by them. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> rights derived from considerations of interests can protect individual animals and place limits on {{what can be done}} to them. These rights cannot be violated, even in the name of the greater good, which means that the cultural and economic practices of human beings will be affected. Anticipating criticism, Cochrane explains that not every interest leads to a right. A full consideration of this argument is outside the scope of the book. The argument was expanded in Cochrane's Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012) which, though published after An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, was based on his doctoral thesis.|$|E

25|$|Mearsheimer {{was also}} {{critical}} of Israel's offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip {{that began in}} December 2008. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> it would not eliminate Hamas's capability to fire missiles and rockets at Israel, {{and that it would}} not cause Hamas to end its fight with Israel. In fact, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> relations between Israel and the Palestinians were likely to get worse in the years ahead.|$|R
5|$|Coleman has {{speculated that}} modern-day {{prosperity}} theology borrows heavily from the New Thought movement, though {{he admits that}} the connection is sometimes unclear. Jenkins notes that critics draw a parallel between prosperity theology and the cargo cult phenomenon. While citing the popularity of prosperity theology in agrarian African communities, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> it can also bear similarities to traditional African religious rituals. J. Matthew Wilson of Southern Methodist University compares the movement to Black theology owing to its focus on uplifting oppressed groups, though he notes that it differs in its concentration on individual success rather than corporate political change.|$|E
5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E
5|$|Fairman {{writes that}} legal {{precedent}} regarding {{use of the}} word is unclear because of contradictory court decisions. He presents case studies of these contradictory applications of the law, and uses them to analyze public perceptions surrounding freedom of speech. He provides examples of exceptions to the First Amendment, such as speech intended to cause violent acts, and discusses the manner in which federal and state governments sanction these exceptions. Fairman draws parallels between protection of comedians' usage of taboo language to the ability of individuals in society to express ideas freely. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> once citizens allow the government to restrict specific words {{that can be used in}} speech, this will lead to an encroachment upon freedom of thought.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspect was}} not prosecuted for rape, but {{was charged with}} public nudity. However, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> his {{statement}} ("The gun is over there") was inadmissible in evidence because he had not first been given the Miranda warning. Since the gun was found {{as a direct result}} of the statement, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the presence of the gun was also inadmissible, making it impossible to convict him.|$|R
