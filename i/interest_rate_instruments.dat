Pflug 1 In {{this paper}} we study algorithms for pricing of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>instruments</b> using a lattice interest model. The price {{is defined as}} expected discounted cash flow. If the cash-flows generated by the instrument depend on the full or partial history of the interest rates (path dependent contracts), then the pricing algorithms are typically of exponential complexity. We show that for some models, including product form cash-flows, additive cash-flows, delayed cash-flows and limited path dependent cash-flows, there exist polynomial pricing algorithms. Moreover we demonstrate the performance of these algorithms. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a detailed examination of various money stock control procedures in a rational expectations environment. The analysis investigates the relative efficiency of controlling monetary aggregate {{through the use}} of an <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>instrument</b> or through various reserve measures under both lagged and contemporaneous reserve requirements. A major result is that borrowed reserve targeting is not necessarily equivalent to a noisy <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>instrument.</b> Further, it is possible that borrowed reserves can represent a more efficient control procedure than in <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>instrument.</b> However, total reserve targeting under contemporaneous reserve requirements generally provides the most efficient control of money and the lowest variability of prices and output. However, total reserve targeting also implies higher <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, which may be one reason why the Fed has never adopted this procedure.

40|$|This paper {{conducts a}} {{theoretical}} {{comparison of the}} potential effectiveness, in terms of money stock controllability, of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and reserve <b>instruments.</b> Whereas previous studies have been basically static, the present analysis is {{carried out in the}} context of a dynamic macroeconomic model with rational expectations. Particular attention is paid to the distinction between contemporaneous and lagged reserve accounting (CRA and LRA). The criterion employed is the expectation of squared deviations of the (log of the) money stock from target values that are reset each period. Analysis in the basic model suggests the following substantive conclusions. (1) With a reserve instrument, monetary control will be more effective under CRA than LRA. (2) With a reserve instrument and LRA, control will be poorer than with an <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>instrument.</b> (3) For a wide range of parameter values, control will be better with a reserve instrument and CRA than with an <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>instrument.</b> ...|$|R

This paper revisits the issues addressed by Sargent and Wallace (1975) on the multiplicity of equilibria when policy is conducted with interest rate rules.

40|$|The {{experience}} of the U.

" Close examination of the historical policy record for the period indicates that the evidence does not support such assertions. The incomplete and erratic recovery from the Great Depression {{can be traced to}} a failure to pursue consistently expansionary policy resulting from an incorrect understanding of monetary policy in an environment of very low short-term nominal interest rates.

40|$|Reserve {{requirement}} is a regulation of most world's central banks, whereby commercial banks must hold a certain fraction of customer deposits in reserves, either deposited {{at the central}} bank or in the bank vaults. While these reserves are calculated periodically, banks usually manage their books daily, which may result in reserve shortfall or surplus. This phenomenon {{has led to the}} emergence of the interbank market where banks transact with one another, trading <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>instruments</b> of various maturities. This paper focuses on the overnight interest rate, as it is assumed to be an indicator of the central bank's policy. Moreover, as the overnight rate is included in the yield curve construction, it implicitly influences the rates for all longer maturities. Finally, as an equilibrium in the reserve supply and demand, movements in the overnight interest rate reflect the dynamics in the interbank market. Here, the main interbank indices are described, before discussing some important features of the overnight rate, and the factors underlying its movements...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{a method for}} market risk measurement of an interest rate derivatives portfolio. The potential value loss of the portfolio is tested {{on a daily basis}} using market scenarios for interest rates and interest rate volatilities. Test scenarios are chosen to represent plausible changes in the market factors. The portfolio being tested consists of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>instruments</b> including swaps, forward rate agreements, futures contracts, futures options, interest rate caps and floors and swaptions. Valuation models for these instrument types are introduced. The market scenarios are specified from historical interest rate data using principal components analysis.

Scenarios testing is used as a supplementary market risk measurement tool in conjunction with the incumbent risk management tools. It is found that the risk measures that result from the test scenarios do help the dealers and the risk managers to evaluate the structure of the current derivatives position. However, the benefits over the current risk measures are limited, and better results could be obtained by methods like scenario simulation and Value at Risk...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend the results derived in our earlier work {{to develop a}} {{methodology}} to employ the maximum-likelihood estimation technique for the pricing of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>instruments.</b> In order to price bonds and their derivative assets, researchers must identify a preference parameter {{in addition to the}} dynamics for the interest rate process. There are two approaches to obtaining estimators for both preference and dynamics parameters: (1) a two-stage approach and (2) a single-stage joint maximum-likelihood (JMLE) approach. The first approach, while tractable, suffers from serious drawbacks, primarily those relating {{to the use of the}} estimates from the first stage in estimating parameters in the second stage. In this paper, we develop the theory necessary for joint maximum-likelihood (JMLE) over the set of bond prices and the interest rate. We operationalize the theory by assuming that the error processes for all coupon bonds are mutually independent and uniformly distributed with a mean of zero. This specification is at least partially justifiable by the observation that since market prices are quoted in 1 / 32 of a dollar, theoretical prices must always be rounded either up or down. JML estimators can be obtained from the joint log-likelihood function by the methods of sequential quadratic programming. Bonds; Financial markets...|$|E

The innovative feature of our analysis is that the construction of the differential is extended from using rates for maturities up to twelve months as in previous published research to rates for maturities up to three years through the use of highly liquid swap rates. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that attempts to evaluate the interest rate forward-futures differential for maturities longer than a year. Opposite to theoretical implication, we find that {{the magnitude of the}} forward-futures rate differential is much smaller than what was expected, and that its sign is negative on many occasions. We further check for potential data skews and other imperfections that may be behind the obtained results and find that neither asynchronicity bias, nor the unconventional feature of the Eurodollar futures pricing can explain the observed phenomena. The term structure interpolation error and the two business day lag between the fixing (settlement) date and the transaction (value) date to which the implied forward rates and prices are applied cannot be attributed to the observed abnormality either. We also find that if the regression analysis is conducted for the price differential instead of that for the rate differential, it results in a much better goodness-of-fit. However, the negative nature of the differential is not captured by the default factor proxied by the TED spread and remains largely unexplained...|$|E

We show that post 2008 the valuation of all <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>instruments</b> of a single yield curve for a particular currency is no longer a feasible approach and the assumption of no arbitrage between di erent tenors is no longer applicable. Following that a closer look is taken into the cause of such widening basis spreads and the impact they have had on the market with a focus on reconstituting the no arbitrage argument and looking at a post crisis multiple curve framework following an axiomatic approach as introduced by Henrard [37] and further explored by Bianchetti and Morini [6, 50]. A bottom-up market approach is taken by Ametrano [2] and the two approaches are shown to be equivalent in result. An analogy is made to quanto style cross currency swap adjustments observed by the aforementioned authors as well as Michaud and Upper [47], and Tuckman and Por rio [57]. We proceed to look at the approaches taken by authors such as Henrard [36, 37] in ex- tending the Black and Stochastic Alpha Beta Rho models to include basis spreads and Kijima et al. [42] who extend a model introduced by Boenkost and Schmidt [11] and put forward a quadratic Gaussian model and a Vasicek model. Mercurio [46] puts forward an extension to the LIBOR Market Model (also referred to as the Brace-Gatarek-Musiela model) under both forward measures and spot measures.

40|$|The role {{of money}} in guiding or {{predicting}} the business cycle is a recurring, if not a cyclical, theme in economics. Different econometric approaches, ranging from narrative to vector autoregressions, have been proposed to assess {{the validity of the}} money matters proposition in the economy. It is argued here that most empirical work on the effectiveness of monetary policy in explaining the business cycle is based on an incorrect premise that the business cycle can be adequately represented by a linear time-series model. This thesis demonstrates that the business cycle is inherently nonlinear and that this nonlinearity can be captured by regime-switching models and, in particular, by STAR models. STAR models applied to the logarithm of the U. S. real GNP have, however, not produced very satisfactory results. One reason advanced for this lack of success is that the growth rate of GNP does not possess enough variability. The position taken here is that the disappointing results generated by STAR models of real GNP are not due to insufficient variability but simply to the choice of the switching variable that defines the states of nature. My contention is that <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>instruments</b> and, more specifically, the federal funds rate describe the environment in which the economy functions. This thesis demonstrates that a STAR model of real GNP, with the regimes being determined by the quarterly difference in the funds rate, outperforms linear representations of real GNP by substantially reducing the standard error. Furthermore, this thesis examines whether the growth rate of money explains the U. S. business cycle when the latter is modeled as a regime-switching process. It is shown that the growth rate of M 1 and M 2, which in the usual bivariate linear setting does not Granger-cause output for the 1960 - 1993 sample period, would 'cause ' output when the business cycle is modeled as a STAR process. This 'causality ' result holds for the difference stationary, trend stationary and Hodrick-Prescott representations of the business cycle. In particular, the growth rate of M 1 has greater effects on the real economy in the low growth regime, while the alternate regime features money neutrality. Finally, this thesis examines whether the Markov regime-switching model of Hamilton, based on an unobservable state of nature, outperforms STAR models based on an observable state of nature when applied to the growth rate of U. S. real GNP. It is shown that a STAR model of real GNP outperforms Hamilton's changing intercept model for the 1960 - 1993 sample period and compares favorably with further refinements of the Hamilton mode...|$|E

An option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, {{to buy or sell}} an underlying asset at a specified strike price on or before a specified date. In this thesis, a valuation model for a perpetual convertible bond is developed when the price dynamics of the underlying share are governed by Markovian regime-switching models. By making use {{of the relationship between the}} convertible bond and an American option, the valuation of a perpetual convertible bond can be transformed into an optimal stopping problem. A novel approach is also proposed to discuss an optimal inventory level of a retail product from a real option perspective in this thesis. The expected present value of the net profit from selling the product which is the objective function of the optimal inventory problem can be given by the actuarial value of a real option. Hence, option pricing techniques are adopted to solve the optimal inventory problem in this thesis. The goal of risk management is to eliminate or minimize the level of risk associated with a business operation. In the risk measurement literature, there is relatively little amount of work focusing on the risk measurement and management of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>instruments.</b> This thesis concerns about building a risk measurement framework based on some modern risk measures, such as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES), for describing and quantifying the risk of interest rate sensitive instruments. From the lessons of the recent financial turmoils, it is understood that maximizing profits is not the only objective that needs to be taken into account. The consideration for risk control is of primal importance. Hence, an optimal submission problem of bid and ask quotes in the presence of risk constraints is studied in this thesis. The optimal submission problem of bid and ask quotes is formulated as a stochastic optimal control problem. Portfolio management is a professional management of various securities and assets in order to match investment objectives and balance risk against performance. Different choices of time series models for asset price may lead to different portfolio management strategies. In this thesis, a discrete-time dynamic programming approach which is flexible enough to deal with the optimal asset allocation problem under a general stochastic dynamical system is explored. It’s also interesting to analyze the implications of the heteroscedastic effect described by a continuous-time stochastic volatility model for evaluating risk of a cash management problem. In this thesis, a continuous-time dynamic programming approach is employed to investigate the cash management problem under stochastic volatility model and constant volatility model respectively. published_or_final_versionMathematicsDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
