On February 20, 1947, in Los Angeles California, 17 {{people were killed and}} 150 injured when a bath, consisting of over 1000 litres of 75% perchloric acid and 25% acetic anhydride by volume, exploded. The plant, 25 other buildings and 40 automobiles were obliterated and 250 nearby homes were damaged. The bath was being used to <b>electro-polish</b> aluminium furniture.

40|$|Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs) {{show the}} most {{potential}} in efficient chemical to electrical energy conversion having approximately half the specific energy compared to gasoline at 5. 54 kW-hr/kg (19. 9 MJ/kg). With a density of 0. 792 kg/L, methanol?s energy density is 4. 39 kW-hr/L. By designing {{a system to}} utilize methanol, the advantages from quick refills {{and the elimination of}} recharge times offer great motivation for further analysis on this topic. Furthermore, methanol is a relatively low cost alcohol/fuel with popular applications such as automobile windshield wiper and aircraft de-icing fluids. One major source of inefficiency within the DMFC is the electrolyte allowing fuel to cross over from the anode to cathode. Proprietary DuPont Nafion 117 has been the standard thus far for all meso-scale direct methanol power conversion systems and its shortcomings are primarily in the areas of slow anodic reaction rates and fuel crossover resulting in lower voltage generation or ?mixed potential. ? Porous Silicon (P-Si) is traditionally used in photovoltaic and photoluminescence applications. Rarely is it used to function as a mechanical filter or membrane. The research deals with investigations into using P-Si as a functioning electrolyte to transfer ions from the anode to cathode of a DMFC. In addition, an effort to observe the consequences of stacking multiple layers of anodes is attempted. Porous silicon was fabricated in a standard Teflon cylindrical cell by an anodization process including varying the current density to etch and <b>electro-polish</b> the silicon membrane. The result was a silicon membrane with pore sizes of approximately 1. 5 ?m when optically characterized by a scanning electron microscope. The porous membranes were then coated in approximately 0. 2 mg/cm 2 Pt-Ru catalyst with a 10 % Nafion solution binding agent onto the anode. Voltage versus current data shows that an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0. 25 V was achieved with one layer when operating at 20 oC. When adding a second layer of porous silicon, the OCV was raised to approximately 0. 32 V under the same conditions. The experimental data suggests that the current collected also increases with an additional identical layer of anode prepared the same way. The only difference is that the air cathode side was surface treated to 0. 1 mg of Pt black catalyst with a 10 % Nafion binding agent to aid in the recombination of hydrogen atoms to form the water byproduct. Porous silicon endurance runs with 2 ml of 3 % by volume methanol (0. 7425 M) fuel dissolved in water show that an operating voltage was generated for approximately 3 hours before the level dropped to approximately 65 % of the maximum voltage of 0. 25 V. Endurance runs with a second layer added extended the useful life of the cell by approximately 2 hours to 5 hours when tested under the same conditions. When tests were conducted for voltage generation by varying the methanol concentration, a linear relationship developed up until the point where methanol seepage through the porous membrane affected measurements. In an effort to quantify the results and confirm the usefulness of the addition of a second layer, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry was conducted on a number of samples to verify the methanol concentration for each layer. Additionally, a pH test was conducted to measure the relative amounts of protons dissolved in solution between the layers...|$|E

30|$|In this work, we {{combined}} annealing and <b>electro-polishing</b> {{together for}} the preparation of smooth Cu substrates. Although <b>electro-polishing</b> is an efficient method to make smooth surfaces, graphene growth is normally conducted at high temperatures which may release the internal strain and move dislocations to the surface. This could cause the Cu surface to be roughened again. Here, we annealed the Cu substrate before <b>electro-polishing</b> to release the residue strain and defects. In this way, the surface reconstruction due to strain release when growing graphene at high temperatures was significantly restricted and the <b>electro-polished</b> surface could be maintained. We demonstrated that the domain density of graphene grown on such Cu substrates is greatly reduced compared to those on just an annealed or an <b>electro-polished</b> Cu substrate. Our method to prepare smooth substrates benefits the synthesis of not only graphene but also other thin-film or two-dimensional materials.|$|R
30|$|As grown {{graphene}} by {{chemical vapor deposition}} typically degrades greatly due to {{the presence}} of grain boundaries, which limit graphene’s excellent properties and integration into advanced applications. It has been demonstrated that there is a strong correlation between substrate morphology and graphene domain density. Here, we investigate how thermal annealing and <b>electro-polishing</b> affects the morphology of Cu foils. Ultra-smooth Cu surfaces can be achieved and maintained at elevated temperatures by <b>electro-polishing</b> after a pre-annealing treatment. This technique has shown to be more effective than just <b>electro-polishing</b> the Cu substrate without pre-annealing. This {{may be due to the}} remaining dislocations and point defects within the Cu bulk material moving to the surface when the Cu is heated. Likewise, a pre-annealing step may release them. Graphene grown on annealed <b>electro-polished</b> Cu substrates show a better quality in terms of lower domain density and higher layer uniformity than those grown on Cu substrates with only annealing or only <b>electro-polishing</b> treatment.|$|R
30|$|In summary, we {{presented}} an efficient route to prepare ultra-smooth substrates by first annealing and then <b>electro-polishing</b> commercial copper, {{which is more}} effective in achieving a smooth surface than just annealing or <b>electro-polishing</b> alone. This is attributed {{to the fact that}} thermal annealing can release the residue internal strain and dislocation, thus the smooth surface achieved by <b>electro-polishing</b> can be preserved at elevated temperatures for graphene growth. The efficiency of the smooth surface prepared in this way was demonstrated by the reduction of graphene domain density, adlayer density, defect density, and the improvement of electrical transport performance.|$|R

On the basis of determining the fatigue life of cold-­rolled steel at one stress level, it was found that there was no sig­nificant difference between the machines at the 1 % significance level. Hand-polished and <b>electro-polished</b> fatigue specimens were tested on both machines. It was found that there was a significant difference between the effects on fatigue life due to the different finishes at the 1 % significance level and that the <b>electro-polished</b> specimens affected a greater degree of scatter in the data than the <b>electro-polished</b> speci­mens. Also, fatigue cracks could be observed sooner on the electro-­polished specimens than on the hand-polished specimens.

30|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} {{that there is a}} close correlation between substrate morphology and graphene nucleation sites [12 – 14]. CVD growth of graphene is typically performed on commercial polycrystalline Cu foils. As-received Cu prepared by a cold rolling process often has many defects [12, 15, 16], such as rolling lines, potential strains, impurities, and native oxide, which greatly impact the quality of the graphene. To improve the morphology of copper, a wide variety of pretreatment methods have been investigated, such as annealing [17 – 24], physical polishing [25], etching [15, 26], <b>electro-polishing</b> [13, 27 – 30], liquefying [31], and melting-resolidification [32]. Among them, annealing and <b>electro-polishing</b> are the most widely employed due to increased efficiency and convenience. With the rearranging of Cu surface atoms, releasing internal stress in copper and growing Cu crystal size, annealing has become an indispensable step in graphene growth [21 – 23]. However, limited by the formation of step bunching and evaporation of Cu atoms [23, 33], the surface of annealed Cu remains relatively rough which has a negative influence on graphene growth. <b>Electro-polishing</b> treatments can significantly improve the surface morphology of the substrate, which is critical to obtain homogenous graphene films as well as avoiding graphene adlayer formation [27, 34]. However, the defects of Cu such as etching pits and spike points are still hard to avoid by traditional <b>electro-polishing</b> techniques [28, 29]. Therefore, techniques to prepare ultra-smooth metallic substrates need to be investigated and improved upon.|$|R

40|$|Fabricating {{small and}} smart devices from {{multifunctional}} materials requires the controlled preparation of surfaces. The effect of using <b>electro-polishing</b> solutions to improve surface finish and remove defects {{present at the}} surface on shape memory alloys, such as Ni-Ti, have been thoroughly characterized in the scientific literature. In contrast, the effectiveness of {{only a small number}} of <b>electro-polishing</b> solutions on magnetic shape memory alloys, such as Ni 2 MnGa, have been systematically evaluated. Thus, predicting the mass removal rate for Ni 2 MnGa, given a set of polishing parameters, is often inaccurate, causing a deleterious effect on the precision of sample preparation. This study seeks to evaluate the performance of an <b>electro-polishing</b> solution composed of sulfuric and phosphoric acid by measuring the surface finish, mass removal rate and number of defects removed by varying the current density, bath chemistry and bath temperature.

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{evaluating}} the residual stress relaxation {{and its effect on}} the fatigue strength of AISI 316 L steel ground surfaces in comparison to <b>electro-polished</b> surfaces. An experimental evaluation was performed using 3 -point and 4 -point bending fatigue tests at Rr = 0. 1 on two sets of notched spec-imens ﬁnished by <b>electro-polishing</b> and grinding. The residual stress ﬁelds were measured at the notch root of specimens, before and after fatigue tests, by means of the X-ray diffraction technique. It was found a degradation of about 35 % for the 4 -point bending fatigue limit at 2 106 cycles of the ground spec-imens in comparison to the <b>electro-polished</b> ones. This degradation is associated with a slight relaxation of the grinding residual stresses which remain signiﬁcant tensile stresses at the stabilized state. While under the 3 -point bending test, these residual stresses relax completely and provoke a noticeable increase of the fatigue limit estimated at about 50 % in comparison to the 4 -point bending fatigue test. The numerical evaluation of residual stress relaxation was carried out by FE analyses of the cyclic hard-ening behaviour of the ground layer. The isotropic and nonlinear kinematic model proposed by Chaboche was used and calibrated for the base material and the ground layer. The results show that residual stres-ses relax to a stabilized state characterized by elastic-shakedown response. This stabilization is occurred after the ﬁrst cycle of the 4 -point bending test corresponding to the higher stress concentration (Kt- 4 p = 1. 66), while it requires many cycles under the 3 -point bending test corresponding to the lower stress concentration (Kt- 3 p = 1. 54).
