50|$|There are no {{factories}} in Chinawal, {{and it is}} surrounded by the farms and trees, so the air and sky remain clear and pollution-free. As the village falls within the tropical region, the sun comes directly overhead every year on 27 May and 17 July. Intense summer heat combined with frequent power outages due to load shedding can result in sunstroke. Traditionally, villagers wear heat-reflective white clothes, as advised by health officials, {{to protect them from}} the heat.

40|$|In recent years, {{about 40}} % {{of the total}} energy {{is devoted to the}} cooling {{infrastructures}} in data centers. One way to save energy is <b>free</b> air <b>cooling</b> (FAC), which utilizes the outside air as the primary cooling medium, instead of air conditioning, to reduce the energy consumption to cool the data centers. Despite the energy saving, the implementation of <b>free</b> air <b>cooling</b> will change the operating environment, which may adversely affect the performance and reliability of telecom equipment. This thesis reviews the challenges and risks posed by <b>free</b> air <b>cooling.</b> The increased temperature, uncontrolled humidity, and possible contamination may cause some failure mechanisms, e. g., Conductive anodic filament (CAF) and corrosion, to be more active. If the local temperatures of some hot spots go beyond their recommended operating conditions (RoC), the performances of the equipment may be affected. In this thesis, a methodology is proposed to identify the impact of <b>free</b> air <b>cooling</b> on telecom equipment performance. It uses the performance variations under traditional air condition (A/C) to create a baseline, and compares the performance variation under variable temperature and humidity representing FAC with the baseline. This method can help data centers determine an appropriate operating environment based on the service requirements, when FAC is implemented. In addition, a statics-based approach is also developed to identify the appropriate metric for the performance variations comparison. It is the first study focusing on the impact of FAC on the telecom equipment performance. This thesis also proposes a multi-stage (design, test, and operation) approach to mitigate the reliability risks of telecom equipment under <b>free</b> air <b>cooling</b> conditions. Specifically, a prognostics-based approach is proposed to mitigate the reliability risks at operation stage, and a case study is presented to show the implementation process. This approach needn't interrupt data center services and doesn't consume additional useful life of telecom equipment. It allows the implementation of FAC in data centers which were not originally designed for this cooling method...|$|R
50|$|The Earth Rangers Centre {{was one of}} {{the first}} 100% radiant heated and cooled {{buildings}} in North America. The building uses 22 km of REHAU radiant tubing, which was laid within the concrete floors and ceiling. The flow of a non-toxic, vegetable-based liquid (water/glycol) through these tubes causes the concrete to become thermally activated. In the warm seasons, cooled liquid is supplied to the concrete slabs. The heat from the computers, people and the sun is absorbed by the concrete, causing the cooled liquid in the tubing to warm up. The liquid is then cooled by rejecting heat to the ground source system or <b>free</b> <b>cooled</b> by directly coupling to the cooling tower. In the colder months, the glycol is warmed by the ground source heat pump before it is supplied to the slab system.|$|R

50|$|<b>Free</b> <b>cooling</b> is an {{economical}} {{method of}} using low external air temperatures {{to assist in}} chilling water, which can then be used for industrial processes, or air conditioning systems. The chilled water can either be used immediately or be stored for the short- or long-term.

50|$|<b>Free</b> <b>cooling</b> {{systems can}} have very high efficiencies, and are {{sometimes}} combined with seasonal {{thermal energy storage}} so the cold of winter {{can be used for}} summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using <b>free</b> <b>cooling</b> early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.|$|E

50|$|Air {{conditioning}} {{can also}} be provided by a process called <b>free</b> <b>cooling</b> which uses pumps to circulate a coolant (typically water or a glycol mix) from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that {{is removed from the}} cooled space. Common storage media are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes, equipped with heat exchanger. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using <b>free</b> <b>cooling</b> early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.|$|E
