40|$|Within half {{a century}} {{or so of the}} {{codification}} of the rules of soccer in the English public schools and at Cambridge University in the middle years of the nineteenth century, soccer was already {{well on the way to}} becoming the world’s most popular sport. The rapid diffusion of soccer from Britain across the world was linked not only with the far-flung network of relationships associated with the British Empire but, perhaps even more importantly, with the even wider network of relationships associated with the growth in Britain’s international trade, for along with the export of British goods and labour, the British- and especially the English- also exported their enthusiasm for sport. The English were to play a major part in developing and disseminating a number of sports, of which cricket and rugby were among the most prominent, but undoubtedly Britain’s biggest sporting export was soccer. Within the context of the international spread of soccer, Britain played a particularly important role for, as Mason (1989, p. 175) has noted, whilst the rapid spread of the game was undoubtedly associated in part with its basic simplicities and with the intrinsic satisfactions of the game itself, it was also associated with Britain’s world power status and her world-wide trading connections. As Britain’s trade and commerce expanded, so sizeable British communities sprang up in many parts of the world and in many countries British <b>engineers,</b> managers, clerks <b>and</b> <b>manual</b> <b>workers</b> played an important part in the early development of the game. This was the case, for example, in Spain where English engineers intro-duced soccer in Bilbao in 1893 (Mason, 1986, p. 68). In Austria, a number of English firms had branches or representatives in the capital, and several Englishmen played central roles in founding the first two soccer clubs in Vienna; the English influence is evident in the names of the two oldes...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we set out}} {{to explain}} extreme left-wing and extreme right-wing {{ideologies}} within and between 30 European countries in a multi-level framework. To test our hypotheses, we use data from the European Social Surveys of 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010 (N = 176. 803), enriched with country characteristics. Our results show that lower educated people <b>and</b> <b>manual</b> <b>workers</b> are more likely to support left-wing extremism, because they are of the opinion that the government should take measures to reduce differences in income levels. Interestingly, the lower educated <b>and</b> <b>manual</b> <b>workers</b> {{are also more likely to}} have an extreme right-wing ideology. This effect, however, is explained by a higher level of perceived ethnic threat. At the country-level, our analyses indicate that a heritage of a totalitarian regime increases the likelihood for an individual to hold an extreme left-wing and extreme right-wing ideology. Moreover, we found a positive effect of the percentage of unemployed people in a country on the probability to support left-wing extremism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Peripheral {{neuropathy}} {{is one of}} {{the principal}} clinical disorders in workers with hand-arm vibration syndrome. Electrophysiological studies aimed at defining the nature of the injury have provided conflicting results. One reason for this lack of consistency might be the sparsity of published longitudinal etiological studies with both good assessment of exposure and a well-defined measure of disease. Against this background we measured conduction velocities in the hand after having assessed vibration exposure over 21 years in a cohort of <b>manual</b> <b>workers.</b> Methods The study group consisted of 155 male office <b>and</b> <b>manual</b> <b>workers</b> at an engineering plant that manufactured pulp and paper machinery. The study has a longitudinal design regarding exposure assessment and a cross-sectional design regarding the outcome of nerve conduction. Hand-arm vibration dose was calculated as the product of self-reported occupational exposure, collected by questionnaire and interviews, and the measured or estimated hand-arm vibration exposure in 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002, and 2008. Distal motor latencies in median and ulnar nerves and sensory nerve conduction over the carpal tunnel and the finger-palm segments in the median nerve were measured in 2008. Before the nerve conduction measurement, the subjects were systemically warmed by a bicycle ergometer test. Results There were no differences in distal latencies between subjects exposed to hand-arm vibration and unexposed subjects, neither in the sensory conduction latencies of the median nerve, nor in the motor conduction latencies of the median and ulnar nerves. Seven subjects (9 %) in the exposed group and three subjects (12 %) in the unexposed group had both pathological sensory nerve conduction at the wrist and symptoms suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome. Conclusion Nerve conduction measurements of peripheral hand nerves revealed no exposure-response association between hand-arm vibration exposure and distal neuropathy of the large myelinated fibers in a cohort of male office <b>and</b> <b>manual</b> <b>workers.</b> </p...|$|R

In parallel, the consequences of occupational-social inequalities on CVD have been well-described and persist. ObjectiveTo assess the potential mediating effect of leisure {{physical activity}} on the consequences of occupational status on CVD. Method 5683 French employed men were recruited from the cohort Prime study. Employees <b>and</b> <b>manual</b> <b>workers</b> were compared with white collar (chef of enterprise, intermediate staff). Hard CVD, myocardial infarction, angina, coronary death, total heart events and stroke were investigated over a 10 years follow-up. Leisure physical activity was measured using compendium physical activity. Cox analyses were used for analyzing the consequences of social inequalities on each event adjusted for classical cardiovascular risks. The propor-tion of effect was calculated to explain the potential mediating effect of leisure physical activity on the relationship between occupational social categories and CVD. ResultsThe incidence rates were respectively for: Hard CVD (2. 4 %), myocardial infarction (2. 2 %), angina (3. 4 %), coronary death (0. 4 %), total heart events (5. 7 %) and stroke (1. 1 %). Employees <b>and</b> <b>manual</b> <b>workers</b> have significant higher risks of hard cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction and total heart events compared with white collar, in crude analysis (HR≈ 1. 5). Adjustments for classical cardiovascular factors reduced significantly these risks while a weak impact of leisure physical activity on the relationships between occupational categories and each event was highlighted. ConclusionThe cardiovascular gradient observed between the different occupational categories is mainly explained by classical cardiovascular factors.
