5|$|Although most {{patients}} present without any known risk factors evident, {{a number of}} risk factors {{for the development of}} cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, the most common of these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). <b>Epidemiologic</b> studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. The mechanism by which PSC increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiological {{data are}} limited, but {{reactive}} attachment disorder {{appears to be}} very uncommon. The prevalence of RAD is unclear but it is probably quite rare, other than in populations of children being reared in the most extreme, deprived settings such as some orphanages. There is little systematically gathered <b>epidemiologic</b> information on RAD. A cohort study of 211 Copenhagen children {{to the age of}} 18 months found a prevalence of 0.9%.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{studies have}} been {{performed}} on data from large populations of children to study {{the relationship between the}} use of vaccines containing thiomersal, and autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Almost all of these studies have found no association between thiomersal-containing vaccines (TCVs) and autism, and studies done after the removal of thiomersal from vaccines have nevertheless shown autism rates continuing to increase. The only <b>epidemiologic</b> research that has found a purported link between TCVs and autism has been conducted by Mark Geier, whose flawed research has not been given any weight by independent reviews.|$|E
5|$|RAD {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{researched}} and most poorly understood disorders in the DSM. There is little systematic <b>epidemiologic</b> information on RAD, its course is not well established and it appears difficult to diagnose accurately. There is a lack of clarity about the presentation of attachment disorders over the age of five years and difficulty in distinguishing between aspects of attachment disorders, disorganized attachment or the consequences of maltreatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{protective}} effects of iodine on breast cancer have been postulated from <b>epidemiologic</b> evidence and described in animal models.|$|E
25|$|In <b>epidemiologic</b> and {{clinical}} studies, stearic acid {{was found to}} be associated with lowered LDL cholesterol in comparison with other saturated fatty acids.|$|E
25|$|A human {{homologue}} of the mammary {{virus has}} been described in 1971 and linked to human breast cancer in several small <b>epidemiologic</b> studies.|$|E
25|$|A {{person with}} an acute febrile {{respiratory}} illness of any severity andan inconclusive MERS-CoV laboratory test (that is, a positive screening test without confirmation) andthe {{person has a}} direct <b>epidemiologic</b> link with a confirmed MERS-CoV case.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{systematic}} {{review of the}} <b>epidemiologic</b> reports of bruxism concluded a prevalence of about 22.1–31% for awake bruxism, 9.7–15.9% for sleep bruxism, and an overall prevalence of about 8–31.4% of bruxism generally. The review also concluded that overall, bruxism affects males and females equally, and affects elderly people less commonly.|$|E
25|$|Genetic and {{hereditary}} causes {{are being}} considered and several <b>epidemiologic</b> findings indicate considerable genetic influence especially for early onset cases. First degree relatives have a 2.5-fold risk, and nearly 6-fold risk when considering early onset cases. Monozygotic twins have double concordance rate for hysterectomy compared to dizygotic twins.|$|E
25|$|Other {{illnesses}} such as one-time {{events like}} stroke and chronic {{conditions such as}} diabetes, {{as well as social}} problems such as domestic violence, are increasingly being integrated into <b>epidemiologic</b> databases called disease registries that are being used in cost-benefit analysis in determining governmental funding for research and prevention.|$|E
25|$|The hygiene {{hypothesis}} postulates {{that the}} cause of asthma, eczema, and other allergic diseases is an unusually clean environment. It is supported by <b>epidemiologic</b> studies for asthma. The hypothesis states that exposure to bacteria and other immune system modulators is important during development, and missing out on this exposure increases risk for asthma and allergy.|$|E
25|$|Better {{still may}} be {{individual}} genetic assessment of relevant genes. As genotyping and sequencing {{have become more}} accessible and affordable, avenues for determining individual genetic makeup have opened dramatically. Even when such methods become commonly available, race {{will continue to be}} important when looking at groups instead of individuals such as in <b>epidemiologic</b> research.|$|E
25|$|Experimental and <b>epidemiologic</b> {{research}} {{over the}} past several years has indicated close associations among ROS, chronic inflammation, and cancer. ROS induces chronic inflammation by the induction of COX-2, inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6), chemokines (IL-8, CXCR4) and pro-inflammatory transcription factors (NF-κB). These chemokines and chemokine receptors, in turn, promote invasion and metastasis of various tumor types.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{similarities}} {{are seen}} between Johne's disease in ruminants and {{inflammatory bowel disease}} in humans, and because of this, some researchers contend the organism is a cause of Crohn's disease. However, <b>epidemiologic</b> studies have provided variable results; in certain studies, the organism (or an immune response directed against it) has been much more frequently found in patients with Crohn's disease than asymptomatic people.|$|E
25|$|The {{tendency}} {{to develop a}} lipoma is not necessarily hereditary, although hereditary conditions such as familial multiple lipomatosis might include lipoma development. Genetic studies in mice have shown a correlation between the HMG I-C gene (previously identified as a gene related to obesity) and lipoma development. These studies support prior <b>epidemiologic</b> data in humans showing a correlation between HMG I-C and mesenchymal tumors.|$|E
25|$|The Ministers {{for health}} of Niger, Nigeria, Egypt, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, the Central African Republic, Sudan and Chad met on 13 January 2005 in Geneva in the {{headquarters}} of the World Health Organization. They decided to organize a series of vaccination campaigns against poliomyelitis and to reinforce <b>epidemiologic</b> monitoring. In 2004, the number of African children infected by poliomyelitis doubled to 1.037.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a wide}} {{variation}} in reported <b>epidemiologic</b> data for bruxism, and this {{is largely due to}} differences in the definition, diagnosis and research methodologies of these studies. E.g. several studies use self-reported bruxism as a measure of bruxism, and since many people with bruxism are not aware of their habit, self-reported tooth grinding and clenching habits may be a poor measure of the true prevalence.|$|E
25|$|Anemia {{has also}} been linked to SIDS (note, however, that per item 6 {{in the list of}} <b>epidemiologic</b> {{characteristics}} below, extent of anemia cannot be evaluated at autopsy because an infant's total hemoglobin can only be measured during life.). SIDS incidence rises from zero at birth, is highest from two to four months of age, and declines toward zero after the infant's first year. Baby boys have a ~50% higher risk of SIDS than girls.|$|E
25|$|Reviews {{have found}} no {{association}} between aspartame and cancer. These reviews have looked at numerous carcinogenicity studies in animals, <b>epidemiologic</b> studies in humans, {{as well as in}} vitro genotoxicity studies. These studies {{have found no}} significant evidence that aspartame causes cancer in animals, damages the genome, or causes cancer in humans at doses currently used. This position is supported by multiple regulatory agencies like the FDA and EFSA as well as scientific bodies such as the National Cancer Institute. Aspartame did not show any DNA-damaging properties either.|$|E
25|$|However, {{access and}} {{availability}} of health care continues to be somewhat limited in lesser developed provinces where the health indices are also lower as compared to national averages. The country is in an <b>epidemiologic</b> transition and faces double burden of the diseases. New emerging threats should also be considered. The demographic and epidemiological transition underway will {{have a significant effect}} on the pattern of morbidity and mortality in the near and distance future, especially as it affects the emergence of chronic non-communicable diseases and the health problems of an aging population.|$|E
25|$|In {{some areas}} special control {{programs}} {{are in place}} or have been planned. The types of control measures depend on the setting (such as <b>epidemiologic,</b> ecologic, and cultural factors). Strict control of the growth and sale of watercress and other edible water plants is important. Individual people can protect themselves by not eating raw watercress and other water plants, especially from endemic grazing areas. Travelers to areas with poor sanitation should avoid food and water that might be contaminated (tainted). Vegetables grown in fields, {{that might have been}} irrigated with polluted water, should be thoroughly cooked, as should viscera from potentially infected animals.|$|E
25|$|These {{claims are}} not {{supported}} by <b>epidemiologic</b> data. The average yearly increase in opioid-related deaths from 1990 to 2002 was nearly three times the yearly increase from 1979–90, with the greatest increase in 2000–02, yet AIDS cases and deaths fell dramatically during the mid-to-late-1990s. Duesberg's claim that recreational drug use, rather than HIV, {{was the cause of}} AIDS has been specifically examined and found to be false. Cohort studies have found that only HIV-positive drug users develop opportunistic infections; HIV-negative drug users do not develop such infections, indicating that HIV rather than drug use is the cause of AIDS.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, {{responsibility}} and {{custody of the}} DoDSR inventory and its associated database was transferred from WRAIR to a newly formed subordinate command of the United States Army Medical Command, the United States Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM). USACHPPM, or simply CHPPM, itself evolved from the U.S. Army Industrial Hygiene Laboratory, which was initially established in 1942 {{at the beginning of}} World War II at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene, now the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The change in custody was accompanied by an increased emphasis on the <b>epidemiologic,</b> public health and health surveillance utility of DoDSR specimens.|$|E
25|$|In {{low-risk}} pregnancies, {{the association}} between cigarette smoking and a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia has been consistent and reproducible across <b>epidemiologic</b> studies. High-risk pregnancies (those with pregestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, history of pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy, or multifetal gestation) showed no significant protective effect. The reason for this discrepancy is not definitively known; research supports speculation that the underlying pathology {{increases the risk of}} preeclampsia {{to such a degree that}} any measurable reduction of risk due to smoking is masked. However, the damaging effects of smoking on overall health and pregnancy outcomes outweighs the benefits in decreasing the incidence of preeclampsia. It is recommended that smoking be stopped prior to, during and after pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, the United States Census Bureau and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) {{conducted}} the National Longitudinal Alcohol <b>Epidemiologic</b> Survey (NLAES). Direct face-to-face {{interviews were conducted}} with one randomly selected respondent, 18 years of age or older, in each of 42,862 households within the contiguous United States and the District of Columbia. NLAES respondents were asked whether they ever attended an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting for any reason related to their drinking. 1106 respondents stated they had attended an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting for their drinking prior-to-the past year. 348 respondents stated they attended an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting prior-to-the past year and continued to attend Alcoholics Anonymous during the past year, a 31% continuance rate.|$|E
25|$|In an <b>epidemiologic</b> study, 56 {{percent of}} {{patients}} with Behçet's disease developed ocular involvement at {{a mean age of}} 30. Ocular involvement was the first manifestation of Behçet's disease in 8.6 {{percent of patients}}. Ocular Behçet's disease with involvement of the optic nerve is rarely reported. Among patients with ocular Behçet's disease funduscopic findings of optic atrophy, and optic disc paleness have been identified with a frequency of 17.9 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively. Other fundoscopic findings include vascular sheathing (23.7%), retinal hemorrhage (9%), macular edema (11.3%), branch retinal vein occlusion (5.8%), and retinal edema (6.6%). However, optic atrophy was the most significant cause of visual impairment identified in 54 percent of patients with ocular Behçet's disease and permanent visual impairment.|$|E
25|$|Other safety {{concerns}} about vaccines {{have been published}} on the Internet, in informal meetings, in books, and at symposia. These include hypotheses that vaccination can cause sudden infant death syndrome, epileptic seizures, allergies, multiple sclerosis, and autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, as well as hypotheses that vaccinations can transmit bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis C virus, and HIV. These hypotheses have been investigated, with the conclusion that currently used vaccines meet high safety standards and that criticism of vaccine safety in the popular press is not justified. Large well-controlled <b>epidemiologic</b> {{studies have been conducted}} and the results do not support the hypothesis that vaccines cause chronic diseases. Furthermore, some vaccines are probably more likely to prevent or modify than cause or exacerbate autoimmune diseases.|$|E
25|$|The {{morbidity}} and mortality caused by HCV has increased {{since the inception of}} highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) because HIV patients are living longer from potent antiretroviral therapies and prophylaxis of traditional opportunistic infections. The effect of HCV on the natural history of HIV remains inconclusive due to contradictory studies documenting no effect, while others show an increase to an AIDS defining illness or death. In the United States, approximately 150,000 to 300,000 people are co-infected with HIV and HCV. This represents 15% to 30% of all HIV infected patients and 5% to 10% of all HCV patients. Reduced HCV antibody production, drug interactions, other causes of liver disease, differing <b>epidemiologic</b> characteristics and natural history complicate the management of HCV/HIV patients. Until recently there was little data published regarding treating HIV–HCV co-infected patients; fortunately recent trials have been published about the safety and efficacy of current treatment options.|$|E
25|$|Inhalation of PM2.5 – PM10 is {{associated}} with elevated risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as low birth weight. Exposure to PM2.5 {{has been associated with}} greater reductions in birth weight than exposure to PM10. PM exposure can cause inflammation, oxidative stress, endocrine disruption, and impaired oxygen transport access to the placenta, all of which are mechanisms for heightening the risk of low birth weight. Overall <b>epidemiologic</b> and toxicological evidence suggests that a causal relationship exists between long-term exposures to PM2.5 and developmental outcomes (i.e. low birth weight). However, studies investigating the significance of trimester-specific exposure have proven to be inconclusive, and results of international studies have been inconsistent in drawing associations of prenatal particulate matter exposure and low birth weight. As perinatal outcomes have been associated with lifelong health and exposure to particulate matter is widespread, this issue is of critical public health importance and additional research will be essential to inform public policy on the matter.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, {{researchers}} from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health identified the blueprint of genes and enzymes in the body that enable sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli and other vegetables, to prevent cancer and remove toxins from cells. The discovery was made using a “gene chip,” which allows researchers to monitor the complex interactions of thousands of proteins on a whole genome rather than one at time. This study was the first gene profiling analysis of a cancer-preventing agent using this approach. University of Minnesota researcher Sabrina Peterson, PhD, RD, coauthored a study with Johanna Lampe of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, in October 2002 that investigated the chemoprotective effect of cruciferous vegetables (e.g., broccoli, Brussels sprouts). Study results published in The Journal of Nutrition outline the metabolism and mechanisms of action of cruciferous vegetable constituents, discusses human studies testing effects of cruciferous vegetables on biotransformation systems and summarizes the <b>epidemiologic</b> and experimental evidence for an effect of genetic polymorphisms (genetic variations) in these enzymes on response to cruciferous vegetable intake.|$|E
25|$|From human {{clinical}} trials, it {{has become}} increasingly evident that a more effective focus of treatment is slowing, stopping and even partially reversing the atheroma growth process. There are several prospective <b>epidemiologic</b> studies including the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), which have supported a direct correlation of Carotid Intima-media thickness (CIMT) with myocardial infarction and stroke risk in patients without cardiovascular disease history. The ARIC Study was conducted in 15,792 individuals between 5 and 65 years of age in four different regions of the US between 1987 and 1989. The baseline CIMT was measured and measurements were repeated at 4- to 7-year intervals by carotid B mode ultrasonography in this study. An increase in CIMT was correlated with an increased risk for CAD. The CHS was initiated in 1988, and the relationship of CIMT with risk of myocardial infarction and stroke was investigated in 4,476 subjects ≤65 years of age. At the end of approximately six years of follow-up, CIMT measurements were correlated with cardiovascular events.|$|E
500|$|Various {{literature}} {{describes the}} syndrome as being [...] "rare" [...] or [...] "extremely rare". There is no <b>epidemiologic</b> data available regarding how many individuals {{suffer from the}} syndrome worldwide; however, there are approximately 200 cases described in medical literature.|$|E
500|$|Findings since 1999 have {{advanced}} TS {{science in the}} areas of genetics, neuroimaging, neurophysiology, and neuropathology. [...] Questions remain regarding how best to classify Tourette syndrome, and how closely Tourette's is related to other movement disorders or psychiatric disorders. Good <b>epidemiologic</b> data is still lacking, and available treatments are not risk free and not always well tolerated. High-profile media coverage focuses on treatments that do not have established safety or efficacy, such as deep brain stimulation, and alternative therapies involving unstudied efficacy and side effects are pursued by many parents.|$|E
500|$|Advocates of a thiomersal-autism link also {{relied on}} {{indirect}} {{evidence from the}} scientific literature, including analogy with neurotoxic effects of other mercury compounds, the reported <b>epidemiologic</b> association between autism and vaccine use, and extrapolation from in vitro experiments and animal studies Studies conducted by Mark Geier and his son David Geier {{have been the most}} frequently cited research by parents advocating a link between thiomersal and autism. This research by Geier has received considerable criticism for methodological problems in his research, including not presenting methods and statistical analyses to others for verification, improperly analyzing data taken from Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, as well as either mislabelling or confusing fundamental statistical terms in his papers, leading to results that were [...] "uninterpretable".|$|E
500|$|In the 1990s, the CIAR's {{executive}} director met with head investigators from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), hoping {{to persuade them}} to cooperate with CIAR. These efforts were mostly unsuccessful, though the CIAR did hire one IARC investigator to conduct a study. Tobacco companies, through the CIAR, subsequently funded research aimed at undermining the validity of <b>epidemiologic</b> research, intending to have these studies published before the IARC released its then-ongoing study on secondhand smoke. In 1997, the CIAR co-hosted a conference in China, along with the Guangzhou Institute for Chemical Carcinogens and the Chinese Epidemiological Association. The conference, entitled [...] "International Workshop on Risk Assessment and Good Epidemiological Practices", brought together over 100 lung cancer researchers, {{some of whom had}} received tobacco industry funding. The workshop was part of the industry's [...] "Asia-specific IARC preparation" [...] effort to convince the public and the media to view the IARC report skeptically when it was published.|$|E
