Transmission of the pathogenic form of prion protein (PrPSc) through veterinary vaccines has been observed, yet no human case {{through the use of}} vaccine products has been reported. However, <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>transmissions</b> of PrPSc in humans through blood components, tissues and growth hormone have been reported. These findings underscore the importance of reliable detection or diagnostic methods to prevent the transmission of prion diseases, given that the number of asymptomatic infected individuals remains unknown, the perceived incubation time for human prion diseases could be decades, and no cure of the diseases has been found yet. A variety of biochemical and molecular methods can selectively concentrate PrPSc to facilitate its detection in tissues and cells. Furthermore, some methods routinely used in the manufacturing process of biological products {{have been found to be}} effective in reducing PrPSc from the products. Questions remain unanswered as to the validation criteria of these methods, the minimal infectious dose of the PrPSc required to cause infection and the susceptibility of cells used in gene therapy or the manufacturing process of biological products to PrPSc infections.

40|$|The {{epidemic}} of {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE) in the United Kingdom, which began in 1986 and has affected nearly 200, 000 cattle, is waning to a conclusion, but leaves in its wake an outbreak of human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, most probably resulting from the consumption of beef products contaminated by central nervous system tissue. Although averaging only 10 - 15 cases a year since its first appearance in 1994, its future magnitude and geographic distribution (in countries that have imported infected British cattle or cattle products, or have endogenous BSE) cannot yet be predicted.

40|$|The {{infectious}} {{agents of}} the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are composed of amyloidogenic prion protein, PrPSc. Real-time quaking-induced conversion can amplify very small amounts of PrPSc seeds in tissues/body fluids of patients or animals. Using this in vitro PrP-amyloid amplification assay, we quantitated the seeding activity of affected human brains. End-point assay using serially diluted brain homogenates of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patients demonstrated that 50 % seeding dose (SD 50) is reached approximately 10 (10) /g brain (values varies 10 (8. 79 - 10. 63) /g). A genetic case (GSS-P 102 L) yielded a similar level of seeding activity in an autopsy brain sample. The range of PrPSc concentrations in the samples, determined by dot-blot assay, was 0. 6 - 5. 4 μg/g brain; therefore, we estimated that 1 SD 50 unit was equivalent to 0. 06 - 0. 27 fg of PrPSc. The SD 50 values of the affected brains dropped more than three orders of magnitude after autoclaving at 121 °C.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The {{simultaneous}} {{emergence of}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) - 1 group M and HIV- 2 into human populations, circa 1921 - 1940, is attributed to urbanization and changes in sexual behavior. We hypothesized that the initial dissemination of HIV- 1, before sexual transmission predominated, was facilitated by the administration, via reusable syringes and needles, of parenteral drugs against tropical diseases. As proxies for highly lethal HIV- 1, we investigated risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human T cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV- 1) infections, blood-borne viruses compatible with prolonged survival, in an area known in 1936 - 1950 as the most virulent focus of African trypanosomiasis. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of individuals 55 years and older in Mbimou land and Nola, Central African Republic. Dried blood spots were used for HCV and HTLV- 1 serologic testing and nucleic acid detection. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were measured by logistic regression. RESULTS: The only risk factor for HCV genotype 4 infection was treatment of trypanosomiasis before 1951 (OR, 3. 13; 95 % CI, 1. 38 - 7. 09). HTLV- 1 infection was associated with having received 2 injections of pentamidine for trypanosomiasis chemoprophylaxis (adjusted OR, 2. 03; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 4. 06) and with transfusions (adjusted OR, 2. 82; 95 % CI, 1. 04 - 7. 67). From historical data, we predicted that 59 % of Mbimous 65 years and older would report treatment for trypanosomiasis before 1951; only 11 % did so. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of trypanosomiasis before 1951 may have caused <b>iatrogenic</b> HCV <b>transmission.</b> Population-wide half-yearly intramuscular pentamidine for trypanosomiasis chemoprophylaxis in 1947 - 1953 may have caused <b>iatrogenic</b> HTLV- 1 <b>transmission.</b> These and other interventions against tropical diseases could have iatrogenically transmitted SIV(cpz), jump-starting the HIV- 1 epidemic.

50|$|These are numerous; typical {{examples}} follow. Because ticks feed {{repeatedly and}} only on blood, and have long lives, they are suitable hosts for {{many types of}} microbes. The microbes exploit the ticks for transmission between one domestic animal and another. Ticks are thus known as vectors (transmitters) of microbes. If the microbes cause pathological changes, they are known as pathogens. Most of these parasitic relationships are highly developed with a strict biological relationship between the microbe and the tick’s gut and salivary glands. However, some microbes, such as Anaplasma marginale and A. centrale, can also be transmitted by biting flies, or by blood on injection needles (<b>iatrogenic</b> <b>transmission).</b> A characteristic of diseases caused by tick-transmitted microbes is the epidemiological state of endemic stability that commonly develops in herds or flocks of livestock. This stability is due {{to high levels of}} immunity to the microbes developing as a result of survival through early infection from infected ticks. The ticks are often constantly present and long-lived. Acquisition of immunity may be aided by the protection of antibodies in the mother’s colostrum (first milk). Some microbes causing diseases associated with ticks are not transmitted by the ticks. For example, the skin disease dermatophilosis of cattle, sheep, and goats is caused by the bacterium Dermatophilus congolensis, which is transmitted by simple contagion. But when Amblyomma variegatum adult ticks are also feeding and causing a systemic suppression of immunity in the host, then dermatophilosis becomes severe or even fatal.|$|E

The prominent lymphotropism of vCJD prions raises the possibility that some surgical procedures may be at risk of <b>iatrogenic</b> vCJD <b>transmission</b> in healthcare facilities. It is therefore vital that decontamination procedures applied to medical devices before their reprocessing are thoroughly validated. A current limitation is the lack of a rapid model permissive to human prions. Here, we developed a prion detection assay based on protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) technology combined with stainless-steel wire surfaces as carriers of prions (Surf-PMCA). This assay allowed the specific detection of minute quantities (10 - 8 brain dilution) of either human vCJD or ovine scrapie PrPTSE adsorbed onto a single steel wire, within a two week timeframe. Using Surf-PMCA we evaluated the performance of several reference and commercially available prion-specific decontamination procedures. Surprisingly, we found the efficiency of several marketed reagents to remove human vCJD PrPTSE was lower than expected. Overall, our results demonstrate that Surf-PMCA can be used as a rapid and ultrasensitive assay for the detection of human vCJD PrPTSE adsorbed onto a metallic surface, therefore facilitating the development and validation of decontamination procedures against human prions...|$|R

(1) Excluding prisoners, who have an HIV seroprevalence of 19 - 25 %, from the donor population significantly reduces the overall HIV seroprevalence from 13 - 16 % to 8 - 9 % (P < 0. 01). (2) Under local circumstances the sensitivity of the used rapid antibody assays was 6. 8 - 17. 9 % lower than claimed by the manufacturer.

40|$|Background. Twenty-five {{years after}} the first {{successful}} cultivation and isolation of Helicobacter pylori, the scientific community is still struggling to understand the way(s) how this bacterium is transmitted among human populations. Aim. In this work, we aimed at evaluating the likelihood of gastrooral, oral-oral, and fecal-oral routes of infection, and also to which extent <b>iatrogenic</b> and zoonotic <b>transmission,</b> breastfeeding, water and food ingestion are likely to contribute to H. pylori transmission. Methods. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge, which included the following text search terms: Helicobacter pylori and epidemiology/epidemiological. Only original articles published in English were considered. For each putative route of transmission, the percentage of papers that supported a positive association with the presence of H. pylori was calculated. Positive associations were considered when the impact of factors related to a specific transmission pathway were statistically significant. Results. Overall, data indicate that successful colonisation by H. pylori is most probably derived from direct person-to-person contact (100 % positive association). Furthermore, exposure of humans to H. pylori derived from environmental sources is a very common event (64 % for zoonotic transmission, 76 % for water, and 75 % for food, respectively). Discussion. Even with the possible pitfalls of this type of analysis, which include the possible existence of confounding factors not accounted for in some of the studies, and the natural tendency to give relevance and present data that are significant rather than data that are not, the case for a multiroute way of transmission is compelling...|$|R

Materials and methods: A cross sectional descriptive study was carried out from July to September 2013, in the Pediatric Department of Fayoum University Hospital in Egypt. A total of fifty-five children with beta-thalassemia major aged from 2 to 16  years were enrolled in the study. All patients were subjected to history taking, examination and investigations including; Complete blood count, serum creatinine, blood urea, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti hepatitis C virus antibody (anti HCV), reticulocytic count, anti B 19 IgM and IgG. Results: Anti-B 19 IgM antibodies (recent infection) were detected in 14. 5 % (8 patients), while anti B 19 IgG antibodies (prior infection) were detected in 18. 2 % (10 patients) of transfusion dependent thalassemic patients. There was a significant statistical correlation between the history of other siblings with {{beta thalassemia}} major, the hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus infection regarding absent, prior and recent infection.

40|$|Human prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), are {{neurodegenerative}} and fatal. Sporadic CJD (sCJD) can {{be transmitted}} between humans through medical procedures involving highly infected organs, such as the central nervous system. However, in variant CJD (vCJD), {{which is due to}} human contamination with the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent, lymphoreticular tissue also harbors the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy-associated prion protein (PrPTSE), which poses a particularly acute risk for <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>transmission.</b> Two blood transfusion-related cases are already documented. In addition, the recent observation of PrPTSE in spleen and muscle in sCJD raised the possibility that peripheral PrPTSE is not limited to vCJD cases. We aimed to clarify the peripheral pathogenesis of human TSEs by using a nonhuman primate model which mimics human diseases. A highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was adapted to the detection of extraneural PrPTSE. We show that affected organs can be divided into two groups. The first is peripheral organs accumulating large amounts of PrPTSE, which represent a high risk of <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>transmission.</b> This category comprises only lymphoreticular organs in the vCJD/BSE model. The second is organs with small amounts of PrPTSE associated with nervous structures. These are the muscles, adrenal glands, and enteric nervous system in the sporadic, iatrogenic, and variant CJD models. In contrast to the first set of organs, this low level of tissue contamination is not strain restricted and seems to be linked to secondary centrifugal spread of the agent through nerves. It might represent a risk for <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>transmission,</b> formerly underestimated despite previous reports of low rates of transmission from peripheral organs of humans to nonhuman primates (5, 10).

Amplification products were obtained from 118 HCV-seropositive participants; subtypes 4 k (in 47 participants) and 4 r (in 38) were most common. Independent risk factors for HCV subtype 4 r seropositivity were intramuscular tuberculosis therapy, intravenous injections at hospital A, intravenous injections before 1960, and injections at a colonial-era venereology clinic.

However, from January 2009 through November 2010, 542 confirmed positive cases {{have been identified in}} 16 different States. This domestic pathways assessment evaluates the risk of releasing an EP pathogen (Theileria equi or Babesia caballi) from a quarantined premises through movement of horses. In addition, this assessment evaluates the risk of disease transmission by ticks, vertical transmission, or <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>transmission.</b> When an acaricide is applied correctly, the risk of EP transmission by ticks to a horse is low. In addition, infected reservoir hosts, environmental factors, and competent vectors must be present for the disease transmission cycle to occur. Vertical transmission of T. equi is considered a moderate risk pathway and the risk of vertical transmission of B. caballi is negligible. <b>Iatrogenic</b> <b>transmission</b> via whole blood transfusion, blood doping, commercial serum/blood plasma, and contaminated equipment poses the highest risk of disease transmission. Blood is an efficient vehicle of transmission for EP pathogens and even a small volume of blood can be infectious. Exposure of an uninfected horse to any of these pathways is likely to result in EP transmission. Iatrogenic exposure may be difficult to regulate. Management practices such as testing blood donors would help mitigate this risk but these practices vary throughout the equine industry.

40|$|The current {{clinical}} views regarding variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and {{in particular}} transmission via endoscopy, of those representing both gastroenterology and the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee are presented {{in an attempt to}} guide clinicians as to “best practice ” given the current state of our knowledge. Most gastroenterologists working in the UKhave been aware for some time thatendoscopy may be a vector for the transmission of prions from a patient incubating, but not clinically manifesting, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) to the next individuals undergoing the same procedure on the same list. To date there are no recorded cases of <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>transmission</b> of vCJD via endoscopy but it remains a risk which will be present fo...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in Switzerland increased two-fold in 2001, and {{figures from the}} first quarter of 2002 indicate that it continues to rise. Neither age at onset nor duration of disease were different from previous years. Genetic analysis of the 27 reported cases revealed only one disease-associated mutation in the prion gene. None of the recognised risk factors for acquired CJD were reported on the official notification forms. Glycotype profiling, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry indicate that none of the cases fulfilled the definition of variant CJD, which is thought to be caused by bovine prions. Several scenarios could account for the increase in CJD, including improved reporting, <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>transmission,</b> and transmission of a prion zoonosis...|$|E
40|$|The National CJD Advisory Committee of the Department of Health and Children (DOHC) {{requested}} the Scientific Advisory Committee of the National Disease Surveillance Centre (NDSC) {{to form a}} subcommittee to advise on prevention of <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>transmission</b> of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). The terms of reference of this subcommittee were to update current Irish infection control guidelines in relation to minimising the risk of transmission of spongiformencephalopathies {{in the health care}} setting. The principal focus of the subcomm ittee was to examine potential transmission of TSEs via contaminated medical devices, along with general infection control guidelines for preventing <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>transmission</b> of TSEs in healthcare settings. Draft guidelines, broadly in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) recomm endations, were released in July 2002. In December 2003 the UK Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) released updated guidelines on preventing the transmission of TSEs. The updated UK guidelines took account of recent evidence relating to inactivation of prion infectivity and differed significantly from previous UK guidelines. The Irish guidelines have thus been updated to also take account of recent evidence and are now broadly in line with UK recommendations. The subcommittee wishes to acknowledge the assistance of Prof D Jeffries, former chair of the UK SEAC, in formulating aspects of these guidelines. The following summarises the key recommendations within this document: details of the recommendations {{can be found in the}} relevant chap ters. Additional recommendations, relating to dental procedures, routine patient car e, laboratory safety, after death and management of possible iatrogenic exposures to TSEs are contained in the appendices. The evidence base relating to human TSEs is continually evolving and these guidelines may need to be updated in the future, to take account of new evidence...|$|E
40|$|Human prion disases are devastating and incurable, but {{are very}} rare. Fears that the bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} epizootic {{would lead to a}} large epidemic of its presumed human counterpart, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), have not been realised. Yet a feeling of uncertainty prevails in the general public and in the biomedical world. The lack of data on the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers of vCJD compounds this uncertainty. In addition to this problem, Switzerland is currently faced with another issue of major public concern: a recent rise in the incidence of CJD. Here we examine the plausibility of several scenarios that may account for the increase in CJD incidence, including ascertainment bias due to improved reporting of CJD, <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>transmission,</b> and transmission of a prion zoonosis. In addition, w...|$|E
40|$|Transmission of prions between {{mammalian}} {{species is}} thought to be limited by a “species barrier,” which depends on differences in the primary structure of prion proteins in the infecting inoculum and the host. Here we demonstrate that a strain of hamster prions thought to be nonpathogenic for conventional mice leads to prion replication to high levels in such mice but without causing clinical disease. Prions pathogenic in both mice and hamsters are produced. These results demonstrate the existence of subclinical forms of prion infection with important public health implications, both with respect to <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>transmission</b> from apparently healthy humans and dietary exposure to cattle and other species exposed to bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions. Current definitions of the species barrier, which have been based on clinical end-points, need to be fundamentally reassessed...|$|E
