25|$|The {{next day}} the boys find a girl crying on the curb and realize she is the former Miss Foley made young again but also totally blind. They assist her to her house, but when they return they're cut off by a parade. The {{carnival}} is out searching the streets {{for the two of}} them. The boys hide, and Will's father spots them hiding under a storm drain in front of the cigar store. The boys convince him to keep quiet. Mr. Dark later arrives to talk to him. Mr. Holloway pretends not to know the two boys whose faces are tattooed on the man's hand, but when the Witch comes and begins to sense the boys' presence he blows cigar smoke at her- choking her and forcing her to leave. Mr. Dark then asks Charles Holloway for his name, and Will's father tells him he is the town library's janitor. That night Will and Jim meet him at the library where he has done research into his own father's ministerial notes. The carnival arrives once a generation, and leaves {{in the midst of a}} giant storm. Mr. Dark appears and the boys hide in the book stacks. He discovers both of them and crushes the janitor's hand when Mr. Holloway attempts to fight him. The tarot witch casts spells on the boys to mesmerize them and also tries to stop Mr. Holloway's heart. Just before he is about to die, Charles Holloway looks at the Witch and begins to laugh hysterically. <b>His</b> <b>laughter</b> wounds her deeply and drives her away. He then follows Mr. Dark to the carnival to rescue the boys.|$|E
500|$|Michael {{had shown}} the office a [...] "work in progress" [...] {{cut of the}} film years ago, but the {{employees}} all mistook it for a comedy, and Michael was so offended by their laughing that he shut down the screening. Everyone is very eager to see Michael's film, albeit only because they all appear in it, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) warns everyone {{to be mindful of}} how sensitive Michael is and not laugh. However, Pam is unable to keep herself from crying out in horror when she sees her mother cast in the film as a scantily clad nurse, and Jim (John Krasinski) fails to fully suppress <b>his</b> <b>laughter</b> at [...] "The Scarn" [...] scene, so Michael angrily stops the movie and takes it away. Michael asks Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) what she thought and she does not seem impressed. Michael gets angry at her because he considers the film his [...] "dream", and he then offers the rest of the office the opportunity to finish seeing the film, which they happily accept. While watching, Michael begins noting how the film is not really very good; he steps outside and tells Holly that it is a bad film but also one that people are having fun watching. They sit down and laugh {{with the rest of the}} office through the film's conclusion.|$|E

500|$|Given {{only the}} artwork and outline {{to work with}} during production, writer Yoshinori Kitase felt that one early scene of Kefka's {{approach}} of a castle was too [...] "boring to make completely normal" [...] and decided to ad-lib a scene where he requests that his accompanying soldiers dust off his boots {{in the middle of}} a desert. The scene set the tone for his personality from that point onwards, suggesting that there [...] "may be a screw or two missing from this character's head". He has been described as [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "manipulative", though he is retiring on occasion when confronted by opposition and even called a coward for delegating his authority. He is also known for his sarcastic tone and one-liners. As Kefka's power grows, his nihilism and madness grow in tandem and as he attains godlike powers he thirsts for the destruction of all life, expresses his loathing of everything in existence by chanting the word [...] "hate" [...] to his enemies. He is also very sadistic, taking amusement at the very idea of people dying and screaming. This is especially evident when he poisons Doma, as well as his admission prior to confronting the Returners for the final time that he enjoys destroying things precisely because precious lives are lost in the process. In his Dissidia appearance, Kefka's insanity is further explored, suggesting that his actions stem from a desire to fill his heart with destruction when love failed to provide his life with meaning. Final Fantasy VI features a song called [...] "Kefka", which exemplifies the [...] "sadistic joy" [...] of the character. <b>His</b> <b>laughter</b> has been called the greatest video game laughter of all time.|$|E
2500|$|Another admirer wrote: [...] "He was a jolly, kindly man, {{and perhaps}} the biggest {{contribution}} he made to Somerset cricket was <b>his</b> <b>laughter</b> and comradeship in the dressing room, {{at a time when}} things were generally going wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|T.S. Eliot {{refers to}} Priapus in his poem [...] (published in Prufrock and Other Observations, 1920): [...] "When Mr. Apollinax visited the United States / <b>His</b> <b>laughter</b> tinkled among the teacups. / I thought of Fragilion, that shy figure among the birch-trees,/ And of Priapus in the {{shrubbery}} / Gaping at {{the lady in}} the swing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The show popularized the phrase, [...] "Is it {{bigger than}} a breadbox?" [...] Steve Allen first posed this on January 18, 1953, {{and it was then}} refined over {{subsequent}} episodes. Soon, other panelists were asking this question as well. On one occasion the guest was a man who made breadboxes. Allen correctly guessed the guest's occupation after Kilgallen asked, [...] "Is it {{bigger than a}} breadbox?" [...] Daly could not restrain <b>his</b> <b>laughter</b> in response to the question.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the primary}} {{expressions}} of the ancient world's conceptions of laughter is the text that survives {{in the form of}} apocryphal letters of [...] Hippocrates about Democritus (Hippocratic Corpus, Epistles 10–21). The laughter of Democritus had a philosophical character, being directed at the life of man and at all the vain fears and hopes related to the gods and to life after death. Democritus here made of <b>his</b> <b>laughter</b> a complete conception of the world, a certain spiritual premise of the man who has attained maturity and has awakened. Hippocrates finally perfectly agreed with him.|$|E
2500|$|Don Giovanni wanders into a graveyard. Leporello happens {{along and}} the two are reunited. Leporello tells Don Giovanni of his brush with danger, and Don Giovanni laughingly taunts him, saying that he took {{advantage}} of his disguise as Leporello by trying to seduce one of Leporello's girlfriends. The voice of the statue interrupts and warns Don Giovanni that <b>his</b> <b>laughter</b> will not last beyond sunrise. At the command of his master, Leporello reads the inscription upon the statue's base: [...] "Here am I waiting for revenge against the scoundrel who killed me" [...] (Dell'empio che mi trasse al passo estremo qui attendo la vendetta). The servant trembles, but Don Giovanni scornfully orders him to invite the statue to dinner, and threatens to kill him if he does not. Leporello makes several attempts to invite the statue to dinner but is too frightened to complete the invitation (Duet: [...] "O, statua gentilissima" [...] – [...] "Oh most noble statue"). Don Giovanni invites the statue to dinner himself. Much to his surprise, the statue nods its head and responds affirmatively.|$|E
