30|$|Contemporary {{co-ordinate}} numbering of the HBV genome assigns {{a position}} of 1 to the first “T” nucleotide after the EcoR 1 restriction site (G|AA T TC) when sequenced in the forward direction. Prior to this convention, {{the start of the}} Core region (position 1901 in the contemporary system) was considered to be the first position of the HBV genome. The HBV genome is circular and position 1 happens to occur within the <b>full</b> <b>S</b> (surface) ORF. Therefore, the full nucleotide sequence of the S gene straddles position 1, and the <b>full</b> <b>S</b> ORF does not run contiguously within a linear sequence in the standard orientation. Thus, the start of the S ORF varies depending on the genotype, being 2854 for genotype A, 2848 for genotypes B to F and H, and 2884 for genotype G. In all genotypes, the S ORF ends at position 835. Extracting the <b>full</b> <b>S</b> gene sequence from linear sequence data therefore requires additional sequence processing.|$|R

50|$|When {{the family}} of noble gases was first {{identified}} {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century, none of them was observed to form any compounds and it was initially believed that they were all inert gases (as they were then known) which could not form compounds. With the development of atomic theory in the early twentieth century, their inertness was ascribed to a full valence shell of electrons which render them very chemically stable and nonreactive. All noble gases have <b>full</b> <b>s</b> and p outer electron shells (except helium, which has no p sublevel), and so do not form chemical compounds easily. Their high ionization energy and almost zero electron affinity explain their non-reactivity.|$|R

The first argon compound with tungsten pentacarbonyl, W(CO)5Ar, was isolated in 1975. However it was not widely recognised at that time. In August 2000, another argon compound, argon fluorohydride (HArF), was formed by researchers at the University of Helsinki, by shining ultraviolet light onto frozen argon containing a small amount of hydrogen fluoride with caesium iodide. This discovery caused the recognition that argon could form weakly bound compounds, even though it was not the first. It is stable up to 17kelvins (−256°C).
