However, only 30 of these do their own tweeting, more than 80 do not subscribe to other politicians and many do not follow any accounts.|$|E
5|$|Frank Clair {{was brought}} in as coach in 1950 and left his mark on the revamped roster; he led the team to Grey Cup wins in 1950 and 1952. The first of these was a 13â€“0 victory over Winnipeg in the notorious Mud Bowl. A November snow storm {{followed}} by mild conditions turned Varsity Stadium into a bog and the play was a shambles; one Winnipeg player is reported to <b>have</b> <b>almost</b> drowned in the muck.|$|E

5|$|The {{expanding}} {{population of}} Scandinavia {{led to a}} shortage of available resources and arable land there {{and led to a}} period of Viking expansion, the Norse gradually shifting their attention from plundering to invasion. Shetland was colonised during the late 8th and 9th centuries, the fate of the existing indigenous population being uncertain. Modern Shetlanders <b>have</b> <b>almost</b> identical proportions of Scandinavian matrilineal and patrilineal genetic ancestry, suggesting that the islands were settled by both men and women in equal measure.|$|E
5|$|Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just {{far enough}} away to <b>have</b> <b>almost</b> the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The angular size (or solid angle) of these two bodies match because, {{although}} the Sun's diameter is about 400 times {{as large as the}} Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant. This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.|$|E
5|$|While most planets with orbital {{periods of}} less than 10 days <b>have</b> <b>almost</b> {{circular}} orbits, HD 217107 b has a somewhat eccentric orbit, and its discoverers hypothesized {{that this could be}} due to the gravitational influence of a second planet in the system at a distance of several astronomical units (AU). Confirmation of the existence of a second planet, HD 217107 c, followed in 2005.|$|E

5|$|While other bats <b>have</b> <b>almost</b> {{lost the}} ability to {{maneuver}} on land, vampire bats can walk, jump, and even run by using a unique, bounding gait, in which the forelimbs instead of the hindlimbs are recruited for force production, as the wings are much more powerful than the legs. This ability to run seems to have evolved independently within the bat lineage.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, 26 museums have {{significant}} holdings of dodo material, almost all {{found in the}} Mare aux Songes. The Natural History Museum, American Museum of Natural History, Cambridge University Museum of Zoology, the Senckenberg Museum, and others <b>have</b> <b>almost</b> complete skeletons, assembled from the dissociated subfossil remains of several individuals. In 2011, a wooden box containing dodo bones from the Edwardian era was rediscovered at the Grant Museum at University College London during preparations for a move. They had been stored with crocodile bones until then.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{official}} forms of their respective languages, the four linguistic regions of Switzerland also have their local dialectal forms. The role played by dialects in each linguistic region varies dramatically: in the German-speaking regions, Swiss German dialects have become ever more prevalent since {{the second half of}} the 20th century, especially in the media, such as radio and television, and are used as an everyday language, while the Swiss variety of Standard German is almost always used instead of dialect for written communication (c.f. diglossic usage of a language). Conversely, in the French-speaking regions the local dialects <b>have</b> <b>almost</b> disappeared (only 6.3% of the population of Valais, 3.9% of Fribourg, and 3.1% of Jura still spoke dialects at the end of the 20th century), while in the Italian-speaking regions dialects are mostly limited to family settings and casual conversation.|$|E

5|$|Bayern {{considers}} {{itself a}} national club. The club had 3,202 fanclubs with total 231,197 members in 2012, {{making it the}} club with {{the largest number of}} organised supporters in Germany. Owing partly to the club having supporters all over the country, all of Bayern's away games have been sold out in recent years. Their following is mainly recruited from the aspiring middle class and regional Bavaria. Despite a large proportion of their supporters having to travel more than 200km (ca. 120 miles) regularly, the club's home matches in the Allianz Arena <b>have</b> <b>almost</b> always been sold out. According to a study by Sport+Markt Bayern is the fifth-most popular football club in Europe with 20.7 million supporters, and the most popular football club in Germany with 10 million supporters.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1941, Action T4 became {{widespread}} public knowledge in Germany (and also in neutral countries and to Germany's enemies), and on August 24, 1941, Hitler ordered the joint chief of the operation Dr. Karl Brandt to halt it due to public protest (however it still continued, not only {{out of the public}} eye but in greater intensity). Hitler did not want to run the risk of an order publicly embarrassing him again and, as a result, the explicit order to carry out the Holocaust was given by him orally. Even if there had been any written instances of this order, they would <b>have</b> <b>almost</b> certainly been destroyed by the Nazis when they realised their defeat was inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Creative {{differences}} {{arising from}} his work with Douglas and the film studios, a dislike of Hollywood, and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick {{to move to the}} United Kingdom in 1961, where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career. His home at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire, which he shared with his wife Christiane, became his workplace, where he did his writing, research, editing, and management of production details. This allowed him to <b>have</b> <b>almost</b> complete artistic control over his films, but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios. His first British productions were two films with Peter Sellers, Lolita (1962) and Dr. Strangelove (1964).|$|E

5|$|Perkin-Elmer {{intended}} to use custom-built and extremely sophisticated computer-controlled polishing machines to grind the mirror to the required shape. However, in case their cutting-edge technology ran into difficulties, NASA demanded that PE sub-contract to Kodak to construct a back-up mirror using traditional mirror-polishing techniques. (The team of Kodak and Itek also bid on the original mirror polishing work. Their bid called for the two companies to double-check each other's work, which would <b>have</b> <b>almost</b> certainly caught the polishing error that later caused such problems.) The Kodak mirror is now on permanent display at the National Air and Space Museum. An Itek mirror built {{as part of the}} effort is now used in the 2.4m telescope at the Magdalena Ridge Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Results from a {{histological}} {{analysis performed}} on a rib from specimen FMNH PR 3847 were reported by McDonald and colleagues in 2017. Extensive bone remodeling {{has occurred in the}} internal matrix of the rib. The medullary cavity, which houses the marrow, is marked by the presence of many cavities, or lacunae. On the outer surface of the bone, osteons <b>have</b> <b>almost</b> completely replaced the interior of the bone; the layered growth of the bone is more visible on the interior of the bone, where five lines of arrested growth (LAGs) are visible. A sixth LAG is possibly present within the medullary region, but is relatively limited in extent, which makes this identification questionable.|$|E
5|$|Reversing the {{traditional}} Link-saves-Zelda plotline, Wand of Gamelon stars Zelda as she adventures to rescue Link {{and her father}} the king who have not returned from their quest. As with Faces of Evil, the game was patterned most closely upon Nintendo's previous side-scroller, , and again features outsourced Russian animation for all cutscenes. Despite the game's similarly positive contemporary reception along with Faces of Evil, modern critics <b>have</b> <b>almost</b> unanimously derided and ridiculed the game for its inability {{to live up to}} modern expectations with the animated cutscenes again having become a particular target of negative reception.|$|E

5|$|Stay-at-home dads {{make up a}} {{very small}} portion of the Australian {{population}} although this appears to be rapidly changing. In 2003, 91% of fathers with children aged under 15 years were employed with 85% employed full-time. Because of this, there are few role models or resources that can help Australian fathers with the stay-at-home dad role. The Australian Bureau of Statistics show that approximately 7% of two parents families with {{children under the age of}} 14 have a father who is unemployed and a mother who works full-time. Stay at home dads in Australia <b>have</b> <b>almost</b> doubled over the past decade from 57,900 to 106,000, and expected to increase in the future. Recent sociological studies have shown that men are dedicating more time and support to their children in comparison to the 19th century. The idea of a stay at home dad were far from mainstream, however the rising demand for female work has influenced this statistic to rise.|$|E
5|$|The band {{structure}} of carbon nanotubes having certain (n,m) indexes {{can be easily}} calculated. A theoretical graph based on this calculations was designed in 1999 by Hiromichi Kataura to rationalize experimental findings. A Kataura plot relates the nanotube diameter and its bandgap energies for all nanotubes in a diameter range. The oscillating shape of every branch of the Kataura plot reflects the intrinsic strong dependence of the SWCNT properties on the (n,m) index rather than on its diameter. For example, (10,1) and (8,3) tubes <b>have</b> <b>almost</b> the same diameter, but very different properties: the former is a metal, but {{the latter is a}} semiconductor.|$|E

Among the most important preserved rooms are the chapter house, the refectory with its magnificent arch braced wooden vault and the painted chamber. Much of the abbey's medieval tiled flooring remains. Other major survivals include the abbey gatehouse, which still provides entrance to the visitor, the moat and fishponds.
