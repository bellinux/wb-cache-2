500|$|Deus Ex: Human Revolution – The Missing Link is a {{downloadable}} episode, {{acting as}} a side story within the events of [...] Like the main game, The Missing Link is played from a first-person perspective, using action role-playing and stealth gameplay elements. The style in which the player can navigate environments and overcome obstacles is relatively open: they can either use an action-based approach involving combat with guns, or use stealth to progress through the game undetected. The environments include security devices such as lasers and cameras. These can be negated by hacking terminals or recovering key codes from <b>datapads</b> retrieved from the environments or defeated enemies. Tactics for defeating enemies are also flexible, with players being offered both lethal and non-lethal takedown options for stealth attacks and weaponry. At the start of The Missing Link, protagonist Adam Jensen is stripped of his equipment and augmentations, forcing him to find them again. His augmentations can be upgraded using collectable Praxis Points. The augmentations Adam can be given are separate from the main game, allowing alternate character customization.|$|R
40|$|In deep {{sub-micron}} technologies with {{critical dimensions}} below 100 nm, the impactof variability on circuit performance becomes unacceptably large. At the same time,novel {{applications such as}} high-end mobile devices require a significant reduction inenergy consumption per operation. Embedded memories {{are one of the}} most criticalbuilding blocks in these contemporary systems, and they {{are one of the most}} likelytechnical bottlenecks for further scaling. Typical low power mobile applications are implemented using a heterogeneousmulticore architecture at system level. A novel, dynamic ram based, memoryarchitecture is proposed for such systems, that could be used for scratchpad memoriesand <b>datapads.</b> This low power DRAM (LPDRAM) architecture can bring an energyconsumption improvement over existing implementations of level 2 and 3 memories. This work will focus on studying circuit level LPDRAM implementations for level 2 scratchpads. Not every DRAM technology is suited to implement LPDRAM. This is due to thefocus put on improving the power consumption. This work studies implementationsfor two technologies: eDRAM and 3 DDRAM. eDRAM technology offers higherdensity compared with SRAM at the cost of increased energy consumption andcomplexity. New optimized DRAM architectures are also being developed for use in 3 D interconnected systems, and should be suitable for mobile applications. This thesisproposes to use both technologies to implement LPDRAM, under the assumption thatsuch technologies becomes available. Different types of SRAM cells and DRAM matrices are studied, to show that themain limitation for using eDRAM is their latency, while stand alone DRAM matricesare mainly limited by their high dynamic energy per access. The electrical factorsresponsible for these differences (longer bitlines, larger memory matrices, etc [...] .) areidentified, and the principles for a DRAM architecture alleviating these penalties isproposed. It is shown that in a typical embedded system working at a reasonably highspeed (around 1 GHz in 90 nm), using modified bitline architecture could bring a lowerstatic energy per bit as well as a higher density than embedded SRAM for L 2 memories. Two prototypes are designed, demonstrating improved dynamic energy consumptionand density, when compared with state of the art SRAM matrices.

50|$|Primordia has {{a typical}} point-and-click interface: a left mouse click to {{interact}} with objects, a right click to examine them. Every function needed is always available from a drop-down control panel that appears when you move the pointer {{to the top of}} the screen. Inventory items can be combined in the inventory UI and may be used on every hotspot and character. Crispin can be told {{to interact with}} objects, too. Crispin also serves as a hint-system blended in appropriately within the game in order to avoid breaking the fourth wall. As Horatio and Crispin wander about, a <b>datapad</b> automatically stores codes, passwords and information about the world. The <b>datapad</b> also contains a map which allows fast travel (whenever that's available) with one click to every known location. Conversations with other robots are handled in a multiple choice fashion. There is both a manual and an automatic save system to make sure your progress is saved.|$|E
5000|$|Siris {{travels to}} Raidriar's castle to {{retrieve}} the <b>datapad,</b> but he realizes {{that he has been}} replaced by a soulless Raidriar, who is killed by Siris. After retrieving the <b>datapad</b> and the soulless Raidriar's weapon, the Infinity Cleaver, he returns to Isa, where the two theorize that The Worker has been forging more Infinity Blades. Isa ventures to the desert, where she uncovers a vault which was used to store all the Infinity Blades, and gains information from Terrovax, the High Lord of House Burke, about the other weapons. Isa rescues Siris' childhood friend, the blacksmith Jensen, from a heavily disfigured Thane, while Siris defeats Therin, [...] "the Killer of Dreams", and retrieves the Infinity Spear. Isa is defeated in a battle with Lelindre, [...] "the Mistress of the End", but she is spared by her and is given the Infinity Daggers. Meanwhile, Siris returns to the Vault of Tears {{to retrieve the}} Redeemer, the device that was used to erase his memories as Ausar, and asks Jensen to reprogram it for another purpose.|$|E
5000|$|With their dropship and the Marlow destroyed, Rookie is {{informed}} by Katya, after finding {{out that she was}} an android, that Weyland has a <b>datapad</b> that can contact his personal dropship and get them off the planet. Meanwhile, Katya successfully removes the implanted chestburster from Col. Tequila's body {{with the aid of a}} backup generator. Rookie goes below the facility to confront Weyland, in order to acquire his <b>datapad,</b> and uses it to recall Weyland's dropship, getting himself, Tequila, and Katya off the planet and in the process revealing the Weyland who was on the planet was an android the entire time. Rookie, Tequila, and Katya are then seen in cryo-sleep on board the dropship while it's traveling to Weyland's personal cruiser, which is in orbit around the planet, while the pilot uploads the datapad's contents to the cruiser's computer. An older-looking Weyland is then delighted to learn that a [...] "live specimen" [...] is secure, and to receive the vital contents of the datapad: the coordinates to the Xenomorph homeworld.|$|E
5000|$|Cad Bane first {{appears in}} the season one finale [...] "Hostage Crisis", where he infiltrates the Senate {{building}} on Coruscant to hold senators hostage {{in exchange for the}} release of Ziro the Hutt. It is revealed in season three that he was hired by Jabba the Hutt to extract Ziro due to an incriminating <b>datapad</b> the latter possessed, and he is hired in the episode [...] "Hunt for Ziro" [...] to track and capture the rogue Hutt, but the latter is instead assassinated by Sy Snootles.|$|E
50|$|While there, Lumpawarrump finds {{a burglar}} at Han and Leia Solo's {{apartment}} and pursues him into Coruscant's dangerous underlevels. Chewbacca and his wife, Mallatobuck, follow their son {{to find him}} fighting the burglar {{in the company of}} a band of thieves. The burglar and the thieves flee when they arrive. Chewbacca notices that Leia's <b>datapad</b> was stolen by the group. Before they can stop him, Lumpawarrump runs off to recover the <b>datapad.</b> When Chewbacca and Mallatobuck find him again, the burglars are carrying him into one of the secret detention centers Palpatine kept in the undercity. Chewbacca saves Lumpawarrump, but Mallatobuck is taken in his stead and dragged away. Chewbacca and Lumpawarrump learn that the burglars were attempting to assassinate the New Republic's leaders so Chewbacca comms Han to inform him of the plot. Chewbacca and Lumpawarrump invade the enemies' base to find an advanced IT-3 interrogation droid attempting to brainwash Malla into believing that the Solos are a danger to her child. Chewbacca attacks and frees Mallatobuck. Han then arrives with a New Republic security company, chases off the last of the pursuers, and takes Chewbacca to the nearest medical center. Security learns that this was a plot by the presumed deceased Ysanne Isard to seek the destruction of the New Republic's government after the Krytos Virus failed to destroy Coruscant. Han tries to free Chewbacca from his life debt again but the Wookiees refused once again. In the end Lumpawarrump heads back to Kashyyyk after learning a lesson about listening to his parents.|$|E
5000|$|Having {{escaped the}} Vault in Infinity Blade: Redemption, Raidriar, {{armed with the}} Infinity Blade, confronts The Worker, and realizes {{that he has been}} {{creating}} more Infinity Blades to keep the Deathless busy while he enacts his plan. After he defeats Raidriar in battle, The Worker clarifies his plan to [...] "cleanse" [...] the planet — to destroy all life on the planet and start anew — and offers Raidriar a chance to join him. Raidriar refuses and, knowing Siris {{is the only one who}} can defeat The Worker, sacrifices himself by teleporting The Worker's <b>datapad</b> away. Infuriated, The Worker impales Raidriar with an Infinity Blade, permanently killing him. Meanwhile, Siris' companion Isa is revived as a Deathless following an attack by The Worker.|$|E
50|$|Several {{months after}} Chewbacca's death, Han Solo has been {{convinced}} {{by his wife}} and Lando Calrissian to stop moping and go on a reconnaissance mission {{on the other side}} of the galaxy from Vector Prime. Near Raxus Prime, Han's shuttle encounters Slave I and is shot down onto the junkyard moon. Keeping a log on his <b>datapad</b> for Leia, Han spends the next few weeks trekking across the moon, making makeshift weapons and survival gear to avoid Boba Fett, who is hunting him. Han finally comes to the realization that there is more than one Fett following him. When that happens, he comes face to face with the real Fett. Fett reveals to Han that the entire event has been a training exercise to cull the weak recruits from the new batch of Mandalorian Protectors prior to them taking up service for the Yuuzhan Vong - since, as mercenaries, the Mandalorians go for the highest bidder, and the Yuuzhan Vong are currently the richest ones in the galaxy. The Mandalorians then take off, leaving Han behind.|$|E
