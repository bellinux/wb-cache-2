500|$|In 2004, {{after the}} release of American Life, Madonna began working on two {{different}} musicals: one tentatively called Hello Suckers and another one with Luc Besson, who previously directed the music video for her single [...] "Love Profusion"., which would portray her as a woman on her deathbed looking back on her life. Madonna collaborated with Patrick Leonard, Ahmadzaï and Price to write new songs, the latter being assigned to pen disco songs sounding like [...] "ABBA on drugs". However, Madonna found herself dissatisfied with the script written by Besson and scrapped it. Hence Madonna and Price decided to use the compositions for the album instead. According to Madonna, it was <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to shift from her previous album's sentiments, since she included those political views in her documentary I'm Going to Tell You a Secret.

[...] She added that: [...] "This feels like more of a filler track than a chart-topping single, and because she's the best of the best, it's <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to knock out a killer song without really trying." [...] Hensel finished her review by saying [...] "'Start Over' is good, but it's not amazing, and we know she can do better."

In order to overcome his stutter, Ben helps Hal to write his entire speech {{to the tune of}} [...] "The Battle Hymn of the Republic". During the tournament, Hal is interrupted {{in the middle of his}} song-speech by Coach Lumbly and a Debate Official who disqualify Hal and Ben on the grounds that neither of them is home-schooled. Ben is satisfied with their efforts, but Hal finds Ginny before leaving. He insists that one day will be his day, while she tells him that it was not <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to betray him as he walks off, having gained a sense of confidence.

500|$|Olga Kurylenko as Camille Montes, a Bolivian {{agent with}} her own vendetta {{regarding}} Greene and Medrano. Forster chose her because out of the 400 women who auditioned, she seemed the least nervous. When she read the script, she was glad she had no love scene with Craig; she felt it would have distracted viewers from her performance. Kurylenko spent three weeks training to fight with weapons, and she learnt a form of indoor skydiving known as body flying. Kurylenko {{said she had to}} do [...] "training non-stop from the morning to the evening" [...] for the action scenes, overcoming her fears with the help of Craig and the stunt team. She was given a DVD box set of Bond films, since the franchise was not easily available to watch in her native Ukraine. Kurylenko found Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies inspiring [...] "because she did the fight scenes by herself." [...] The producers had intended to cast a South American actress in the role. Kurylenko trained with a dialect coach to perform with a Spanish accent. She said that the accent was <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> because she has [...] "a lot of hispanic friends, from Latin America and Spain, and it's an accent I've always heard".

[...] "Some of them weren't really a good fit, as I found out during the process, and by the end I kind of realised that I needed someone to help me along the way. So, it made sense to ask Brian as he's a great friend of mine that also lives in Los Angeles and he has a great studio with lots of resources. He helped oversee the production of the record and made sure that everything was done on time and nothing was missed out during recording and it worked out just perfect", she said. It was <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to work with Foote who, understanding that she was a [...] "control freak", tried to [...] "step away a lot".
