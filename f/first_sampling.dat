2500|$|The main {{characteristics}} of the basaltic rocks {{with respect to the}} rocks of the lunar highlands is that the basalts contain higher abundances of olivine and pyroxene, and less plagioclase. They are more rich in iron than terrestrial basalts, and also have lower viscosities. Some of them have high abundances of a ferro-titanic oxide called ilmenite. Because the <b>first</b> <b>sampling</b> of rocks contained a high content of ilmenite and other related minerals, they received the name of [...] "high titanium" [...] basalts. The Apollo 12 mission returned to Earth with basalts of lower titanium concentrations, and these were dubbed [...] "low titanium" [...] basalts. Subsequent missions, including the Soviet robotic probes, returned with basalts with even lower concentrations, now called [...] "very low titanium" [...] basalts. The Clementine space probe returned data showing that the mare basalts have a continuum in titanium concentrations, with the highest concentration rocks being the least abundant.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of sampling was {{developed during the}} 1930s in Bell Laboratories by Nyquist, after whom the sampling theorem is named.

The current state-of-the-art oscilloscopes — with bandwidths of typically 20 MHz — were not able to do this and the 300 MHz effective bandwidth of their analog sampling oscilloscope represented a considerable advance.|$|E

To perform stabilization of a second sample of the shape memory alloy, a <b>first</b> <b>sample</b> of the shape memory alloy is selected for isobaric treatment and the second sample is selected for isothermal treatment. When applying the isobaric treatment to the <b>first</b> <b>sample,</b> a constant stress {{is applied to the}} <b>first</b> <b>sample.</b> Temperature is also cycled from a minimum temperature to a maximum temperature until a strain on the <b>first</b> <b>sample</b> stabilizes.

40|$|In {{evaluation}} of the operating characteristics of mixed sampling plans (a known), the probability function, Fn(x), {{of the difference between}} the extreme value and the mean is important. Because it is an n multiple integral where n is the <b>first</b> <b>sample</b> size of a mixed dependent sampling plan, the normal way of evaluating this probability is the recursive quadrature method. Using this method, as the <b>first</b> <b>sample</b> size increases, the amount of computation increases exponentially, so that this probability function becomes a bottleneck in computation. This thesis presents a Taylor-expansion method for handling the probability function for large <b>first</b> <b>sample</b> sizes with satisfactory precision, for an arbitrary given x. In such a way, the {{evaluation of}} the dependent mixed plans is extended to a larger <b>first</b> <b>sample</b> size than previously available in the literature. Theoretically, the computational method presented here could be used for evaluating mixed plans of very large <b>first</b> <b>sample</b> size. Technically, however, this method is limited, by the computer memory resources. Using the computational approach described above, a FORTRAN program that can compute the operating characteristics of mixed plans for <b>first</b> <b>sample</b> sizes of up to 50 was developed. A series of mixed dependent sampling plans were then evaluated with an accuracy of seven decimal places...|$|R
50|$|Moffett Field, CA {{was home}} to a pilot scale PRB {{initiated}} by the U.S. Navy in 1995. The Moffett Field PRB used a funnel and gate design, with the funnel being composed of interlocking steel sheet piles, while the gate consisted of granular zero-valent iron. The primary contaminants were trichloroethene (TCE), cis-1,2 dichloroethene (cDCE), and perchloroethene (PCE). Data from quarterly monitoring, tracer testing, and iron cell coring {{have been used to}} determine the effectiveness of the site. Since the <b>first</b> <b>sampling</b> event in June 1996, concentrations of all chlorinated compounds have been reduced to either non-detect levels or below the maximum contaminant levels.|$|E

5000|$|A {{particle}} detector (implemented {{through use of}} an Anton type 213 Geiger-Müller tube) {{to measure}} lower radiation (especially near Venus), {{also known as the}} Iowa detector, as it was provided by the University of Iowa. It was a miniature tube having a 1.2 mg/cm2 mica window about 0.3 cm in diameter and weighing about 60 g. It detected soft x-rays efficiently and ultraviolet inefficiently, and was previously used in Injun 1, Explorer 12 and Explorer 14. It was able to detect protons above 500 keV in energy and electrons above 35 keV. The length of the basic telemetry frame was 887.04 seconds. During each frame, the counting rate of the detector was sampled twice at intervals separated by 37 seconds. The <b>first</b> <b>sampling</b> was the number of counts during an interval of 9.60 seconds (known as the 'long gate'); the second was the number of counts during an interval of 0.827 seconds (known as the 'short gate'). The long gate accumulator overflowed on the 256th count and the short gate accumulator overflowed on the 65,536th count. The maximum counting rate of the tube was 50,000 per second.|$|E
5000|$|Kashtan et al. [...] {{presented}} the <b>first</b> <b>sampling</b> NM discovery algorithm, {{which was based}} on edge sampling throughout the network. This algorithm estimates concentrations of induced sub-graphs and can be utilized for motif discovery in directed or undirected networks. The sampling procedure of the algorithm starts from an arbitrary edge of the network that leads to a sub-graph of size two, and then expands the sub-graph by choosing a random edge that is incident to the current sub-graph. After that, it continues choosing random neighboring edges until a sub-graph of size n is obtained. Finally, the sampled sub-graph is expanded to include all of the edges that exist in the network between these n nodes. When an algorithm uses a sampling approach, taking unbiased samples is the most important issue that the algorithm might address. The sampling procedure, however, does not take samples uniformly and therefore Kashtan et al. proposed a weighting scheme that assigns different weights to the different sub-graphs within network. The underlying principle of weight allocation is exploiting the information of the sampling probability for each sub-graph, i.e. the probable sub-graphs will obtain comparatively less weights in comparison to the improbable sub-graphs; hence, the algorithm must calculate the sampling probability of each sub-graph that has been sampled. This weighting technique assists mfinder to determine sub-graph concentrations impartially.|$|E

As a child, I was already intrigued by man and landscape: beauty and harmony, {{the sense of}} space and the horizon, {{the meeting of the}} sky and the earth. Of course, I had no idea of such abstract notions in Kakasszék. All I knew was that people there were sincere and earned their living with hard work. Beauty is of course subjective. A face, a tree, a train arriving at the Kakasszék station, a lake nearby were beautiful. The larks starting to sing in spring and the return of the swallows showed the harmony of life. The birds gathering in autumn before migration hinted at transitoriness. Kakasszék is the past. It has changed. It has lost its character. Most of the elderly have left for other beauties. My mother moved closer to me. The feelings, however, are the same. This emotional world echoes in my collection, in this book.In my early youth I was not too receptive to art. I was over thirty when it touched me. Since then I have been its captive. In 1991, for the empty walls of my new office I bought eight pictures, only Hungarian ones. The <b>first</b> <b>sampling</b> proved successful. Works by István Csók, Gusztáv Magyar Mannheimer and Márk Rubovics are still noted items in my collection. Collecting became a passion and stole into my everyday life. My scope of interest kept stretching toward 19th-century classicist, romantic landscapes, then early 19th-century portraits, and I got to Nagybánya as well. The legacy of Ádám Mányoki and János Kupeczky is also part of the Hungarian atmosphere. The Hungarian National Gallery wanted Ferenc Rákóczi II to re-marry Charlotte Amelie, princess of Hessen. With my help, they managed to do so—for the duration of the Ádám Mányoki exhibition.Lajos Gulácsy and Tivadar Csontváry Kosztka found me, too! By some miracle, masterpieces find me.The encounter with the paintings of Károly Markó the Elder had an elementary impact on me. I was wholly overcome by the passion for Markó. György Károlyi commissioned Károly Markó the Elder to paint a picture in 1836. It was Women by the Well (Serpent Killer). The picture was owned by the Károlyi family during the past 150 years and it came into my possession by the courtesy of the heirs of Katinka Andrássy. It was an incredible accident again that I came across another latent chef d'œuvre known only in verbal description: St. Paul Shipwrecked on Malta. One Markó picture attracted the next. I bought the sixteenth item of my Markó collection at a Sotheby's auction in London in the summer of 2003. Another masterpiece—the painting had never been seen in Hungary. It was purchased by a Spanish infante after Markó's death in Italy, in the 1860s. I take greatest pride in this segment of my collection: the romantic landscapes, the Markós, Ligetis, Telepys. I probably owe it to this encounter that now I have not only some three hundred pictures but also a collection spunning from the early 18th century to 1935 expressing {{more or less the same}} sensitivity.When it comes to the second half of the 20th century, however, I am at a loss. It was just a few years ago that I began to open up to this period. The works of art grow in number—Jenő Barcsay, Menyhért Tóth, Endre Bálint and the lifework of János Bozsó, just to mention a few names. This material has not matured into a coherent whole yet. That will be my collector's task for the next ten years. The organizing principles are binding: sincerity, beauty, harmony... Works of art that are close to me, that touch me.The past thirteen years of my life was about business in the first place and collecting art was only secondary. Giving up my post in London, I went into entrepreneurship. I wanted to show my expertise in my country. There were many transactions, many successes, my fortune increased. I kept rushing on, to new challenges, to new transactions. I did not realize the enormous difference between wealth and eternal values. I thought I would succeed in achieving everything. I was wrong.After three years of bitter struggle, one day in 2002 I caught sight of Zsuzsa Péreli's latest work, Aequilibrium, on the wall of the Gobelin Museum in Aubusson. I immediately knew where I had made a mistake. It took just a nick of time to realize that the missing element in my successful but lopsided life was equilibrium. I had to create harmony not only in my environment, among the Markós, but also in my own soul. I realised that genuine equilibrium was not horizontal but between spiritual goals and earthly values. Between [...] "Heaven" [...] and [...] "Earth". Earthly goals in heavenly perspectives. From the horizon of Kakasszék through the beauty of Markó's landscape I arrived at Péreli's search for equilibrium. I wish that everyone will cover this road in their hearts.These experiences gave impetus to the idea of the Gábor Kovács Art Foundation. The 21st century is the century of foundations. Foundation is the future. The art works being created now will enrich the collection of the Gábor Kovács Art Foundation. We would like to build a collection characterized by beauty, harmony, a search for equilibrium, by inspired sincerity representing high spiritual goals and eternal values hidden in external beauty. I am sure that in the next one hundred years we will find the artists who [...] "come in touch with God" [...] as Csontváry says in his diary. After sixty years of solitude, our art will be part of European art again. And to the joy of us all, a collection will be created involving real values which have a message for us all." ...|$|E
