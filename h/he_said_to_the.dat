5|$|The U.S. VIII Corps {{had arrived}} in the United Kingdom in December 1943, and was {{commanded}} by Major General Emil F. Reinhardt, who Middleton had known for many years. While he was an able commander, his lack of combat experience resulted in his being replaced by Middleton (though Reinhardt would later command a division in the European fighting). Middleton's first stop in Europe before assuming command of VIII Corps was to confer with his friend and commander, Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower had asked Middleton about his views on making Patton the commander of an army. Middleton {{thought it was a good}} idea since Patton was such an able fighter. Eisenhower agreed, but was concerned about Patton's propensity to embarrass the Army by things <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press. Following this Patton was given command of the Third Army, which was headquartered north of London during the preparation for the invasion of Normandy.|$|E

Today, it's impossible to motivate anyone. They're afraid they'll be attacked by the radical Islamists and the BAV.|$|E

25|$|Andy Gibb guest-starred {{twice on}} Punky: once as himself, hosting a pre-teen beauty pageant; and once {{as a music}} {{instructor}} hired by Henry for Punky, who persuades the young man {{to go out for}} a recording contract. They run afoul of a con artist instead; Henry, correctly suspecting this man is up to no good, proclaims his own intention to break into the music business. When the con man repeats the same words to Henry that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> music teacher, he is exposed as a fraud; the teacher thanks Henry by giving Punky several free lessons.|$|E
25|$|Richard Ellmann {{describes}} {{the effect of}} the book in his biography of Oscar Wilde:Whistler rushed to congratulate Huysmans the next day on his 'marvellous' book. Bourget, at that time a close friend of Huysmans as of Wilde, admired it greatly; Paul Valéry called it his 'Bible and his bedside book' and this is what it became for Wilde. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Morning News: 'This last book of Huysmans {{is one of the best}} I have ever seen'. It was being reviewed everywhere as the guidebook of decadence. At the very moment that Wilde was falling in with social patterns, he was confronted with a book which even in its title defied them.|$|E

60|$|He {{was silent}} at dinner, unusually kindly to Ted and Verona, hesitating but not disapproving when Verona stated her opinion of Kenneth Escott's opinion of Dr. John Jennison Drew's {{opinion of the}} {{opinions}} of the evolutionists. Ted was working in a garage through the summer vacation, and he related his daily triumphs: how he had found a cracked ball-race, what <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Old Grouch, what <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> foreman about the future of wireless telephony.|$|R
25|$|He {{ended his}} {{participation}} {{by saying that}} under the circumstances he felt he could be of no further use to the Convention in the matter. His final word in the Convention was the tragic one – Better for us never to have met than to have met and failed. Late in February the malady from which he was suffering grew worse. He left Dublin for London knowing that a settlement from the Convention was impossible. An operation in March 1918 to remove an intestinal obstruction appeared to progress well at first, but then he suffered heart failure. He died {{a few hours later}} at a London nursing home on 6 March 1918. One of the last things <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jesuit Father who was with him to the end, was, Father, I am a broken hearted man. At the Convention, his last move was an adoption of O’Brien’s policy of accommodating Unionist opposition in the North and in the South. It was too late. Had he joined O’Brien ten years before and carried the Irish Party with him, it is possible that Ireland’s destiny would have been settled by evolution.|$|E
25|$|It {{caused him}} to reflect. But there was no result. The {{justice of the peace}} was a stern man. On the trial he found fault with the scheme and {{required}} us to explain upon what we based our strange conduct—as he called it. The understudy said:“On the custom of the niggers. They all do it.” The justice forgot his dignity and descended to sarcasm. “Custom of the niggers! Are our morals so inadequate that we have to borrow of niggers?” Then <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jury: “Three melons were owing; they were collected from persons not proven to owe them: this is theft; they were collected by compulsion: this is extortion. A melon was added for the widows and orphans. It was owed by no one. It is another theft, another extortion. Return it whence it came, with the others. It is not permissible here to apply to any purpose goods dishonestly obtained; not even to the feeding of widows and orphans, for this would be to put a shame upon charity and dishonor it.” He said it in open court, before everybody, and to me it did not seem very kind.|$|E

Shankly retrieved the scarf and wore it. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> policeman: [...] "Don't you do that. That's precious". Shankly saw the offer of the scarf as a mark of respect which deserved his respect in return.|$|E

500|$|His {{career was}} safe, but the episode briefly {{affected}} Gielgud's health; {{he suffered a}} nervous breakdown some months afterwards. He never spoke publicly about the incident, and it was quickly sidelined by the press and politely ignored by writers during his lifetime. Privately he made donations to gay campaign groups, but did not endorse them in public.

500|$|According to Kumaraswamy, Gandhi {{initially}} supported Arab demands {{with respect}} to Palestine. He justified this support by invoking Islam, stating that [...] "non-Muslims cannot acquire sovereign jurisdiction" [...] in Jazirat al-Arab (Arabian Peninsula). These arguments, states Kumaraswamy, {{were a part of}} his political strategy to win Muslim support during the Khilafat movement. In post-Khilafat period, Gandhi neither negated Jewish demands nor did he use Islamic texts or history to support Muslim claims against Israel. Gandhi's silence after the Khilafat period may represent an evolution in his understanding of the conflicting religious claims over Palestine, according to Kumaraswamy. In 1938, Gandhi spoke in favour of Jewish claims. In March 1946, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Member of British Parliament Sidney Silverman, [...] "if the Arabs have a claim to Palestine, the Jews have a prior claim", a position very different from his earlier stance.|$|E
500|$|The war had a {{significant}} influence on Moore's life - he said his only romance ended when his fiancée Lorna, a nurse, was killed in London in 1943 by a bomb which struck her ambulance. Moore subsequently remarked that he never married because [...] "there {{was no one else}} for me... second best is no good for me... I would have liked a wife and family, but it was not to be." [...] In his autobiography he said that after sixty years he still thought about her, and because of her death [...] "if I saw the entire German nation sinking into the sea, I could be relied upon to help push it down." [...] In May 2012 <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Radio Times magazine, [...] "We must take care. There may be another war. The Germans will try again, given another chance". He also said, in the same interview, that [...] "The only good Kraut is a dead Kraut." [...] However, some doubt has arisen over Moore's account, as researchers have been unable to identify Lorna, despite the meticulous records kept of wartime civilian casualties.|$|E

500|$|Among the prisoners, Seaman First Class Joseph Randolph [...] "Joe" [...] Small, a winch {{operator}} in Division Four and a natural leader who called cadence when his division marched, {{was asked by}} officers to assemble a handful of reliable men as a team of acting petty officers {{and to keep the}} other prisoners on good behavior. On August 10, there had been conflicts between the prisoners and their guards as the prisoners were marched to the mess hall for meals. There was also a brief fight in the mess hall, and some prisoners were seen sharpening spoons into makeshift knives. Small sensed a general air of rebelliousness among the prisoners. To counteract the rising tension and offset the disaster he saw coming, Small convened a short meeting that evening aboard the crowded barge and told the prisoners to [...] "knock off the horseplay", stay out of trouble and obey the shore patrol guards (who were black) and the officers, because the alternative (white Marines as guards) would be worse. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> men, [...] "We've got the officers by the ballsthey can do nothing to us if we don't do anything to them. If we stick together, they can't do anything to us." ...|$|E
500|$|On 15 June 1863, the {{principal}} Charles Williams (principal 1857–1877) and fellows agreed {{to renovate the}} chapel. One of the prime movers behind the decision was the vice-principal, Lewis Gilbertson, {{as part of his}} unsuccessful attempt to move the college towards Anglo-Catholicism. The architect George Edmund Street was appointed, and had almost free rein in his work. In 1863, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bursar that the chapel was [...] "so good in style considering its late date" [...] that it would be [...] "very inadvisable to alter it in any respect, save one, the old features of the walls and roofing". However, he later said that the fittings were [...] "incongruous", with the seats being [...] "so thoroughly uncomfortable that kneeling is rendered all but impossible, and sitting even is concerted into a sort of penance". His work was completed in 1864, at a cost of £1,679 18s 10d. The arch of the chancel was widened and the memorials to Sir Eubule Thelwell and Francis Mansell, which had been {{on each side of the}} arch, were moved to the north wall of the chancel. The original Jacobean woodwork was removed, with the exception of the screen donated by Edwards and the pulpit, new seats were installed and new paving was placed in the main part of the chapel. A stone reredos was added behind the altar, although the design originally submitted by Street was not approved and he was asked to make changes. [...] The reredos as finally installed has three marble panels: a crucifixion scene (centre), Christ carrying his cross (right) and Christ on the knees of St Mary (left). The altar has a slab and six pillars, all made from granite.|$|E
