5|$|Throughout the game, {{he has a}} {{rivalry with}} Seifer Almasy. The opening {{sequence}} features the duel where Squall receives his facial scar (giving Seifer a mirror image), and scenes where Squall and Seifer are supposed to cooperate are characterized by squabbles between the cadets. Although Seifer later allies with the Sorceress (requiring Squall to fight him several times), Squall still <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> camaraderie with him.|$|E

40|$|Happiness is {{generally}} considered an emotion with only beneficial effects, particularly in childhood. However, there are some situations where the style of information processing triggered by happiness could be a liability. In particular, happiness seems to motivate a top-down processing style, which could impair performance when attention to detail is required. Indeed, in Experiment 1, 10 - to 11 -year-old children (N = 30) induced to <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> happy mood were slower to locate a simple shape embedded in a complex figure than those induced to <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> sad mood. In Experiment 2, 6 - to 7 -year-old children (N = 61) induced to <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> happy mood found fewer embedded shapes than those induced to <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> sad or neutral mood. Happiness may have unintended and possibly undesirable cognitive consequences, even in childhood...|$|R
5|$|Dexter {{manages to}} keep the lab a secret from his clueless, cheerful Mom (voiced by Kath Soucie) and Dad (voiced by Jeff Bennett), who never take notice of it. However, he is {{frequently}} in conflict with his hyperactive older sister, Dee Dee (voiced by Allison Moore in seasons 1 and 3; Kat Cressida in seasons 2 and 4). In spite of Dexter's advanced technology, Dee Dee eludes all manner of security, and once inside her brother's laboratory, she delights in playing haphazardly, often wreaking havoc with his inventions. Though seemingly dim-witted, Dee Dee often outsmarts her brother and even gives him helpful advice. For his part, Dexter, though annoyed by his intrusive sibling, <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> reluctant affection for her and will come to her defense if she is imperiled.|$|E
5|$|Early in most plots Bond {{is called}} in to see M, {{the head of the}} UK's Secret Intelligence Service (also known as MI6) in his or her office to receive his assignment. In several films, Bond {{receives}} the assignment outside the MI6 offices, or at a local secret office. Bond often finds M in a subdued state of agitation over a new threat to world peace. M typically shows confidence in the service's best agent but <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> need to rein in Bond for his risky methods and often chides him for his indiscretions.|$|E
5|$|In Apison, Tennessee, {{authorities}} {{receive a}} tip from someone named Sidney alleging child abuse and weapons possession by a local cult called the Temple of the Seven Stars. The FBI and BATF stage a raid on the Temple's compound, but are unable to find its leader, Vernon Ephesian (Michael Massee). Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) experiences déjà vu and walks into a field on the compound, where he finds a trapdoor. Inside, Mulder and Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) find Ephesian preparing to drink a red liquid with his six wives. Mulder stops them and handcuffs Ephesian, but he <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> strange connection {{to one of the}} wives, Melissa Riedal-Ephesian (Kristen Cloke).|$|E

5|$|Some {{of those}} who have {{attempted}} to find an escape from the impulse to power have resorted to forms of quietism or pacifism. One major proponent of such approaches was the philosopher Laozi. From Russell's perspective, such views are incoherent, since they only deny themselves coercive power, but retain an interest in persuading others to their cause; and persuasion is a form of power, for Russell. Moreover, he argues that the love of power can actually be a good thing. For instance, if one <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> certain duty towards their neighbours, they may attempt to attain power to help those neighbours (Russell 1938:215–216). In sum, the focus of any policy should not be on a ban on kinds of power, but rather, on certain kinds of use of power (Russell 1938:221).|$|E
5|$|The atomic radii of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. Because of the shielding effect, when an atom {{has more than one}} electron shell, each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus. In the alkali metals, the outermost electron only <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> net charge of +1, as some of the nuclear charge (which is equal to the atomic number) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge. Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.|$|E
5|$|The large, maze-like mansion's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} with angles slightly askew, resulting in off-center perspectives and doors that {{open and close}} by themselves. The immense library contains the ramshackle spiral staircase from which the previous owner hanged herself; the vast conservatory is adorned with eerie statues. During their first night in the house, Eleanor and Theo are terrified by supernatural occurrences outside Theo's bedroom door. Deafening banging is heard against {{the door and the}} voice of a young girl is heard echoing with laughter. Despite the turbulence, Eleanor <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> tentative affinity to Hill House.|$|E

5|$|The plot of Arrested Development {{revolves}} around {{the members of the}} Bluth family, a formerly-wealthy family who continue to lead extravagant lifestyles despite their changed circumstances and who often find themselves drawn into interactions with incestuous undertones. At the center of the show is Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman), the show's straight man, who strives {{to do the right thing}} and keep his family together, despite their materialism, selfishness, and manipulative natures. Michael is a widowed single father. His teenage son, George Michael (Michael Cera), has the same qualities of decency but <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> constant pressure to live up to his father's expectations and is often reluctant to follow his father's plans. He battles with a crush he has on cousin Maeby, which developed from a kiss she gave him as part of a prank.|$|E

The balance between sleeping and waking is regulated by a process called homeostasis. Induced or perceived lack of sleep is commonly called sleep deprivation.|$|E

Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits can also indicate breast cancer.|$|E

As the pregnancy takes a toll on Bella's health, Edward tries to talk her into having an abortion to save her own life.

Soon, Edward comes to love the baby as well, after he hears its thoughts and learns that the baby loves Bella in return and doesn't mean to hurt her.|$|E
25|$|When {{the patient}} ingests {{just a small}} amount of food, the first {{response}} is a stretching of the wall of the stomach pouch, stimulating nerves which tell the brain that the stomach is full. The patient <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> sensation of fullness, as if they had just eaten a large meal—but with just a thimble-full of food. Most people do not stop eating simply in response to a feeling of fullness, but the patient rapidly learns that subsequent bites must be eaten very slowly and carefully, to avoid increasing discomfort or vomiting.|$|E
25|$|The game {{begins in}} 1920, with Cardinal Felicio Briganti sending Father Arno Moriani of the Sacred Congregation of Rites {{to the village}} of Vladoviste in the diocese of Alba Iula in Transylvania to {{investigate}} a candidate for sainthood; Martha Calugarul, a physician and scientist who died several months previously. The process is being fast-tracked because Transylvania has recently been annexed by Romania, leaving Catholics in the minority, and the church <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> local saint may help the Catholics reaffirm their identity in relation to the majority Orthodox in the diocese.|$|E
