5|$|From {{the work}} of Heaviside (1887) it had become clear that the {{performance}} of telegraph lines, and most especially telephone lines, could be improved {{by the addition of}} inductance to the line. George Campbell at AT implemented this idea (1899) by inserting loading coils at intervals along the line. Campbell found that as well as the desired improvements to the line's characteristics in the passband there was also a definite frequency beyond which signals could not be passed without great attenuation. This was a result of the loading coils and the line capacitance forming a low-pass filter, an effect that is only apparent on lines incorporating lumped components such as the loading coils. This naturally led Campbell (1910) to produce a filter with ladder topology, a glance at the circuit diagram of this filter is enough to see its relationship to a loaded transmission line. The cut-off phenomenon is an undesirable side-effect as far as loaded lines are concerned but for telephone FDM filters <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> what is required. For this application, Campbell produced band-pass filters to the same ladder topology by replacing the inductors and capacitors with resonators and anti-resonators respectively. Both the loaded line and FDM were of great benefit economically to AT and this led to fast development of filtering from this point onwards.|$|E

25|$|Dispersing {{boundary}} {{plays the}} same role for billiards as negative curvature does for geodesic flows causing the exponential instability of the dynamics. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> this dispersing mechanism that gives dispersing billiards their strongest chaotic properties, as it was established by Yakov G. Sinai. Namely, the billiards are ergodic, mixing, Bernoulli, having a positive Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and an exponential decay of correlations.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> {{because he}} fathered a healthy son with Elizabeth that Henry was {{convinced}} his wife's inability to bear him a son was Catherine's fault. She {{gave birth to}} at least three boys, yet only the first lived as long as seven weeks. These facts led Henry to believe {{there was something wrong}} with his marriage to Catherine, and that he needed to annul his marriage.|$|E
25|$|Air and sea {{transportation}} commonly use the nautical mile. This {{is about}} one minute of arc of latitude along any meridian arc and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> defined as 1852metres (about 1.151 statute miles). It is not an SI unit (although it is accepted {{for use in the}} SI by the BIPM). The prime unit of speed or velocity for maritime and air navigation remains the knot (nautical mile per hour).|$|E
25|$|But the {{position}} I call initial may be arbitrarily chosen from among all {{the position}}s my body has successively occupied. If {{a more or less}} unconscious memory of these successive positions is necessary for the genesis of the notion of space, this memory can go back more or less into the past. Hence results a certain indeterminateness in the very definition of space, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> this indeterminateness which constitutes its relativity.|$|E

25|$|The liberal {{champions of}} {{equality}} {{under the law}} were {{fully aware of the}} fact that men are born unequal and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> their inequality that generates social cooperation and civilization. Equality under the law was in their opinion not designed to correct the inexorable facts of the universe and to make natural inequality disappear. It was, on the contrary, the device to secure for the whole of mankind the maximum of benefits it can derive from it. Henceforth no man-made institutions should prevent a man from attaining that station in which he can best serve his fellow citizens.|$|E
25|$|The entire {{capitalist}} system thus {{appears as a}} hierarchical structure of different levels of productivity, and as {{the outcome of the}} uneven and combined development of states, regions, branches of industry and firms, unleashed by the quest for surplus-profit. It forms an integrated unity, but it is an integrated unity of non-homogeneous parts, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> the unity that here determines the lack of homogeneity. In this whole system development and underdevelopment reciprocally determine each other, for while the quest for surplus-profits constitutes the prime motive power behind the mechanisms of growth, surplus-profit can only be achieved at the expense of less productive regions and branches of production.|$|E
25|$|These studies {{point to}} the fact that even though we only attend to and process limited information, we have a vast amount of {{knowledge}} at our disposal through our highly unrestricted sensory registers. It is the selective attention, perception, and higher order cognitive processing that limits these inputs and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> these processes that make up our conscious awareness. Thus, in order to formulate some explanations for Plato's Problem, our conscious awareness limits our experience; nevertheless, it seems as though some stimuli that are sensed by our sensory registers, although seemingly rejected by conscious awareness, are actually retained and abstracted into our memories for further processing. All of our fully functioning perceptual faculties enhance, supplement, and optimize our experiences.|$|E

25|$|Justice White {{authored}} the dissent, {{joined by}} Justices Marshall, Blackmun and Stevens. In noting his {{disagreement with the}} other Justices, Justice White argues that the third part of the O'Brien test (requiring that the law be unrelated to the suppression of free expression) is not satisfied. In pursuing legitimate government interests, the statute in place restricts conduct - nudity - that is integral to the expressive nature of the act. Citing Schad v. Borough of Mt. Ephraim (1981), the dissent remarks that the condition of human nakedness {{in and of itself}} does not transform otherwise protected speech into unprotected speech. Justice White argues that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> because of the heightened expressive impact that the state chooses to forbid public nudity, because the state desires to control the negative secondary effects such as prostitution and degradation of women. Because nudity {{is an essential part of}} the potency of the expression in question, the law unconstitutionally restricts that expression.|$|E
25|$|The {{stock market}} crash in the 1929 not only {{affected}} {{the business community and}} the public’s economic confidence, but also it led to the banking system soon after the turmoil. The boom of the US economy in the 1920s was based on high indebtedness, and the rupture of the debt chain caused by the collapse of the bank had produced widespread and far-reaching adverse effects. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> because of the shaky banking system, the United States was using monetary policy to save the economy that had been severely constrained. The American economist Kindleberger of long-term studying of the Great Depression pointed out that in the 1929, before and {{after the collapse of the}} stock market, the Fed lowered interest rates, tried to expand the money supply and eased the financial market tensions for several times, however they were not successful, the fundamental reason was that the relationship between various credit institutions and the community was in a drastic adjustment process, the normal supply channels for money supply were blocked. Later, some economists argued that the Fed should do a large-scale opening market business at that time, but the essence of the statement was that the US government should be quick to implement measures to expand fiscal spending and fiscal deficits, whereas, the essence of this argument was that the US government should be promptly implemented to expand the fiscal spending and the fiscal deficits measures.|$|E

500|$|Friederike Müller, a pupil of Chopin, wrote: [...] " [...] playing {{was always}} noble and beautiful; his tones sang, whether in full forte or softest piano. He took {{infinite}} pains to teach his pupils this legato, cantabile style of playing. His most severe criticism was 'He—or she—does {{not know how}} to join two notes together.' He also demanded the strictest adherence to rhythm. He hated all lingering and dragging, misplaced rubatos, as well as exaggerated ritardandos... and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> in this respect that people make such terrible errors in playing his works." ...|$|E
500|$|While the President may block certain {{appointments}} to the Council, he cannot remove a permanent member from his seat. In fact, {{it does not}} appear that any person has the power to do so. The door may be open for potential abuse with appointments based on some political agenda rather than merit. The counterpoint is that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> those in power who are best placed to scrutinize bills for illegitimate differentiating measures, because [...] "it is often those with political affiliations who can make the biggest contribution to the discussion; if nothing else, from the folly and error of their past ways".|$|E
500|$|For three years, from 1787 to 1790, Dissenters {{had been}} {{attempting}} to convince Parliament {{to repeal the}} Test and Corporation Acts which limited {{the civil rights of}} Dissenters. After the repeal was voted down for the third time, Barbauld burst onto the public stage after [...] "nine years of silence." [...] Her highly charged pamphlet is written in a biting and sarcastic tone; it opens, [...] "we thank you for the compliment paid the Dissenters, when you suppose that the moment they are eligible to places of power and profit, all such places will at once be filled with them." [...] She argues that Dissenters deserve the same rights as any other men: [...] "We claim it as men, we claim it as citizens, we claim it as good subjects." [...] Moreover, she contends that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> the isolation forced on Dissenters by others that marks them out, not anything inherent in their form of worship. Finally, appealing to British patriotism, she maintains that the French cannot be allowed to outstrip the English in liberty.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> can <b>be</b> said, {{that with}} the Wyndham Land Act the state moved to subvent the process of land {{purchase}} in Ireland by means of state loans “as a healing measure”. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> the policy which Parnell enunciated in the 1880s.|$|R

500|$|After {{reprisal}} from death, Davies felt {{further development}} {{was necessary for}} the character to continue {{as part of the}} drama; one of the first decisions the production team made was that [...] "we can't make this guy look like a sap any longer. He's got to be made aware of what's going on." [...] The events of the episode [...] "Meat", in which Rhys learns the real nature of Gwen's job, are seen by Davies as a [...] "rite of passage" [...] for the couple. Director Colin Teague highlights Rhys' [...] patience in relation to Gwen noting that [...] "he puts up with an awful lot from his wife to be". The second series also explores Rhys's insecurities and jealousies towards series protagonist Captain Jack Harkness, for whom a mutual sexual tension with Gwen was evident in the first series. Both Stephen James Walker and episode writer Catherine Tregenna felt that [...] "the triangle of relationships between Rhys, Gwen and Jack" [...] comprise [...] "the most interesting narrative territory explored in 'Meat'". Although actor Kai Owen feels that [...] "Rhys will always {{have a little bit of}} a gripe about Jack", he concedes that [...] "he respects him and he'll like him for looking after Gwen". Walker comments favourably on the interaction between Jack and Rhys in [...] "Meat" [...] in both its antagonistic and comedic forms, citing the scene in the truck where Rhys questions Jack as particularly effective. The two function as unusual literary foils for one another, insofar as their relationships with Gwen are concerned. In her critical essay Gwen's Evil Stepmother: Concerning Gloves and Magic Slippers, Valerie Estelle Frankel compares Rhys to Jack, likening the former to a [...] "sweet, kind handsome prince" [...] and the latter to a [...] "compelling trickster." [...] Whilst Eve Myles feels that [...] "Jack highlights how ordinary Rhys is", she states that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> this ordinariness which makes Rhys a benefit to Gwen's strength of character.|$|E
