5|$|In Black River, {{northeast}} of Watertown, NY3 intersects NY342 at the southwestern {{tip of the}} Fort Drum Military Reservation. NY3 follows {{the southern edge of}} the base to Deferiet, where NY3 turns south to follow the Black River while NY3A continues along the border of Fort Drum. NY3 follows the river to Carthage, where it overlaps NY126 briefly before heading northeast to rejoin NY3A at Fargo. NY3 forms the southern boundary of the base from NY3A east to just west of the Jefferson-Lewis County line; however, near Natural Bridge, the Fort Drum boundary heads due north before becoming <b>delimited</b> <b>by</b> the Indian River. NY3, meanwhile, traverses the river and enters Lewis County.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of the bridge in the town of Webster, NY104 has exits leading to Bay Road, Five Mile Line Road, Hard Road, and Holt Road prior to {{entering}} the village of Webster. Within the village, NY104 meets NY250 (North Avenue) and Phillips Road by way of interchanges before exiting the village. The expressway loosely parallels the southern edge of the primary Xerox campus to an exit with Salt Road, where it downgrades to a divided highway as it continues east to Basket Road and the Monroe–Wayne county line, partially <b>delimited</b> <b>by</b> NY404.|$|E
5|$|UConn {{owns the}} two longest winning streaks, any gender, in college {{basketball}} history. The longest streak, 111 straight wins, started with a win against Creighton on December 23, 2014, and ended on March 31, 2017 when a buzzer-beater {{at the end of}} the overtime caused a loss in the 2017 NCAA Final Four by Mississippi State. The second streak counts 90 consecutive wins, including two undefeated seasons (2008–09 and 2009–10), and was <b>delimited</b> <b>by</b> two losses against Stanford, the first on April 6, 2008 in the National Semifinals of the NCAA Tournament, and the second – three seasons later – on December 19, 2010.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologist William R. Coe {{divided the}} Mundo Perdido complex into two clearly demarcated areas that he {{referred}} to as the High Plaza and the Low Plaza. The High Plaza is the area around the Lost World Pyramid. It is closed on the south side by Structures 6C-24 and 6C-25. A range of eight adjoining structures divide the High Plaza from the Plaza of the Seven Temples to the east. On the north side, the Plaza is principally <b>delimited</b> <b>by</b> Structures 5D-77, 5C-45, 5C-46, together with some smaller structures. The Low Plaza lies {{to the west of the}} Lost World Pyramid, centred upon Structure 5C-53, a low platform. The Low Plaza is closed on its north side by the Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49), which is the second largest structure in the whole complex.|$|E
5|$|Near the {{northern}} edge of downtown, NY5, NY8, and NY12 interchange with NY5A and NY5S on the southern bank of the Mohawk River. At the exit, the three state routes are joined on the arterial by I-790, which follows NY5, NY8, and NY12 across the Mohawk River and the neighboring Erie Canal to a large interchange north of the canal. Here, I-790 and NY5 separate from the concurrency while NY8 and NY12 remain concurrent into Deerfield as a limited-access highway. After an interchange with a former routing of NY12, NY8 separates from the highway and returns to an at-grade roadway as it heads northeast to Poland. Near the Oneida-Herkimer County line (here <b>delimited</b> <b>by</b> West Canada Creek), NY8 merges with NY28 and follows the route across the county line (as well as the creek) into Poland. In the center of the village, NY8 splits from NY28 and heads northeast into Adirondack Park.|$|E
5|$|Within Antananarivo, the {{territory}} of the Andriamboninolona, designated generations before by King Andrianjaka, included the neighborhood of Ambatomasina (east of Andohalo) and extended from Ambohitantely eastward to Ambatolampy and north to the principal road that led to Ambavahadimasina. The neighborhoods reserved in Antananarivo for the Andriandranando, also decreed by Andrianjaka, laid to the northeast of Andohalo and extended from Ambavahadimasina in the west to Ambohimanoro in the east, and from the road to Ambavahadimasina northward to Ambatonandriankoto. King Andriamasinavalona decreed that within the capital city, the Zanaralambo would live in the area <b>delimited</b> <b>by</b> Ambohitsoa to the southwest, Ambodivoanonoka to the east, and Andohalokely in the north. Outside the capital, each group had its designated villages. The Andriamboninolona lived in Ambohitromby, Fieferana, Ambohipiainana and Ambohitriniandriana. The Andriandranando lived in Soamanandrarina, Betsizaraina, Ambohibe, Ihadiambola and Akadindramamy. Finally, the Zanaralambo inhabited Lazaina, Ambatofotsy and Masindray.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature {{established}} a statewide legislative route system that initially consisted of 37 unsigned routes. Much {{of what is}} now NY31 west of Jordan became part of one of three routes, namely Route14, Route20, and Route30. Route30 began at the Niagara Falls city line (<b>delimited</b> <b>by</b> modern NY61) and followed current NY31 east to Sanborn, where it turned north onto modern NY429. The route followed current NY429 to Ridge Road in Porter, at which point it turned to follow Ridge Road eastward to what is now NY63 in Ridgeway. Route30 went south here, utilizing modern NY63 between Ridgeway and Medina. It rejoined what is now NY31 in the latter location and proceeded eastward on roughly current NY31 to the Rochester city line. In the vicinity of Brockport, however, Route30 was routed on West Avenue and modern NY19 instead. From the southeastern city line to NY96 in the village of Pittsford, Monroe Avenue (modern NY31) was part of Route14, which turned south onto South Main Street in the center of Pittsford. Lastly, the segment what is now NY31 between current NY31F and NY350 in the village of Macedon and NY317 in Jordan was part of Route20.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} {{bank of the}} river, NY31 exits NY690 but joins NY370 {{at the end of}} the exit ramp. Together, NY31 and 370 enter Baldwinsville, {{intersecting}} NY48 in the village center. Three blocks from NY48, NY370 splits from NY31. As NY370 heads for downtown Syracuse, NY31 continues east, overlapping NY631 for a short distance before passing through Lysander New Community and crossing the Seneca River again. Now in the town of Clay, NY31 meets NY481 at an interchange in the shadow of the Great Northern Mall. NY31 continues eastward through the town to Cicero, where it meets US11 and I-81 at exit30. As NY31 heads away from I-81, Oneida Lake slowly becomes visible to the north. NY31 comes within a mile (about 1.6km) of the lakeshore before turning slightly to parallel the shoreline. Near the Madison County line, here <b>delimited</b> <b>by</b> Chittenango Creek, NY31 enters the western half of Bridgeport and meets the eastern terminus of NY298 near the banks of the creek. NY31 continues eastward, crossing the creek and entering Madison County and the remaining portion of Bridgeport.|$|E

50|$|Saramago's {{experimental}} style often features long sentences, {{at times}} more than a page long. He used periods sparingly, choosing instead a loose flow of clauses joined by commas. Many of his paragraphs extend for pages without pausing for dialogue, (which Saramago chooses not to <b>delimit</b> <b>by</b> quotation marks); when the speaker changes, Saramago capitalizes the first letter of the new speaker's clause. His works often refer to his other works. In his novel Blindness, Saramago completely abandons the use of proper nouns, instead referring to characters simply by some unique characteristic, an example of his style reflecting the recurring themes of identity and meaning found throughout his work.|$|R

We show that a 1 is rapidly degraded in a haploids. In a/a diploids, a 2 and a 1 are stabilized by heterodimerization. Association depends on N-terminal coiled-coil interactions between a 1 and a 2. Residues in a 2 important for these interactions overlap a critical determinant of an a 2 degradation signal, which we <b>delimit</b> <b>by</b> extensive mutagenesis. Our data provide a detailed description of a natural ubiquitin-dependent degradation signal and point to a molecular mechanism for regulated turnover in which proteolytic signals are differentially masked in alternative multiprotein complexes...|$|R
50|$|The Champagne Riots of 1910 and 1911 {{resulted}} {{from a series of}} problems faced by grape growers in the Champagne area of France. These included four years of disastrous crop losses, the infestation of the phylloxera louse (which destroyed 15000 acre of vineyards that year alone), low income and the belief that wine merchants were using grapes from outside the Champagne region. The precipitating event may have been the announcement in 1908 by the French government that it would <b>delimit</b> <b>by</b> decree the exact geographic area that would be granted economic advantage and protection by being awarded the Champagne appellation. This early development of Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée regulation benefitted the Marne and Aisne districts to the significant exclusion of the Aube district which included the town of Troyes—the historic capital of the Champagne region.|$|R
