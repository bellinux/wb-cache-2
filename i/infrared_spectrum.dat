5|$|According to {{a summary}} of the research, {{atmospheric}} water absorption in such an exoplanet renders it larger in appearance across one part of the <b>infrared</b> <b>spectrum,</b> compared to wavelengths in the visible spectrum. Barman took Knutson's Hubble data on HD 209458 b, applied to his theoretical model, and allegedly identified water absorption in the planet's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The dust {{present in}} the {{interstellar}} medium is opaque to visual light. It is more transparent to far-infrared, {{which can be used}} to observe the interior regions of giant molecular clouds and galactic cores in great detail. Infrared is also used to observe distant, red-shifted galaxies that were formed much earlier {{in the history of the}} Universe. Water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb a number of useful portions of the <b>infrared</b> <b>spectrum,</b> so high-altitude or space-based telescopes are used for infrared astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Hiʻiaka is {{the outer}} and, at roughly 350km in diameter, the larger and {{brighter}} {{of the two}} moons. Strong absorption features observed at 1.5, 1.65 and 2 µm in its <b>infrared</b> <b>spectrum</b> are consistent with nearly pure crystalline water ice covering much of its surface. The unusual spectrum, and its similarity to absorption lines in the spectrum of Haumea, led Brown and colleagues to conclude that {{it was unlikely that}} the system of moons was formed by the gravitational capture of passing Kuiper belt objects into orbit around the dwarf planet: instead, the Haumean moons must be fragments of Haumea itself.|$|E

The magnetic properties of the new copper(II) complexes were studied from room temperature to liquid nitrogen temperatures. The magnetic data show that both complexes exhibit antiferromagnetic interactions with a singlet ground state and a thermally accessible triplet excited state. Magnetic data and <b>infrared</b> <b>spectra</b> indicate the complexes are halogenbridged.

5|$|Infrared {{astronomy}} {{is founded}} on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The <b>infrared</b> <b>spectrum</b> is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic protostars and their host star clusters.|$|E
5|$|In an {{alternative}} scenario, the exozodiacal dust may be generated in an outer belt that is orbiting between 55 and 90AU from Epsilon Eridani {{and has an}} assumed mass of 10−3 times the mass of Earth. This dust is then transported inward past the orbit of Epsilon Eridani b. When collisions between the dust grains are taken into account, the dust will reproduce the observed <b>infrared</b> <b>spectrum</b> and brightness. Outside the radius of ice sublimation, located beyond 10AU from Epsilon Eridani where the temperatures fall below 100K, the best fit to the observations occurs when a mix of ice and silicate dust is assumed. Inside this radius, the dust must consist of silicate grains that lack volatiles.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the applications of computer modeling methods to {{the interpretation of}} the <b>infrared</b> <b>spectra</b> of zeolite frameworks. The correlation of the breathing vibration of ring structures in zeolitic lattices with their <b>infrared</b> <b>spectra</b> was investigated by the molecular dynamics method. The calculations reveal that in periodic zeolite lattices the ring-breathing vibrations participate in many normal modes. Despite the fact that the ring-breathing vibrations are calculated to have characteristic frequencies, no general correlation of these frequencies with band positions in the <b>infrared</b> <b>spectra</b> was found. Ab initio quantum-chemical calculations were employed to examine the band observed at 885 cm− 1 in the <b>infrared</b> <b>spectra</b> of activated zeolite beta [J. Phys. Chem. B 104 (2000) 286]. In agreement with the assignment proposed from the experiments, the calculations show that the observed band belongs to a vibration of −O−Al(OH) −O− sites of the zeolite and ascribe this vibration to the antisymmetric stretching vibration of the O−Al−O bridge...|$|R
25|$|Burying engines {{deep inside}} the {{fuselage}} also minimizes the thermal visibility or infrared signature of the exhaust. At the engine intake, cold air from the boundary layer below the main inlet enters the fuselage (boundary layer suction, first tested on the Northrop X-21) and is mixed with hot exhaust air just before the nozzles (similar to the Ryan AQM-91 Firefly). According to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, this results in less energy (thermal radiation in the <b>infrared</b> <b>spectrum)</b> being released and thus a reduced heat signature. The resulting cooler air is conducted over a surface composed of heat resistant carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer and titanium alloy elements, which disperse the air laterally, in order to accelerate its cooling. The B-2 lacks afterburners as the hot exhaust would increase the infrared footprint; breaking the sound barrier would produce an obvious sonic boom as well as aerodynamic heating of the aircraft skin which would also increase the infrared footprint.|$|E
25|$|Nonlinear {{two-dimensional}} {{infrared spectroscopy}} is the infrared version of correlation spectroscopy. Nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy {{is a technique}} that has become available {{with the development of}} femtosecond infrared laser pulses. In this experiment, first a set of pump pulses is applied to the sample. This is followed by a waiting time during which the system is allowed to relax. The typical waiting time lasts from zero to several picoseconds, and the duration can be controlled with a resolution of tens of femtoseconds. A probe pulse is then applied, resulting in the emission of a signal from the sample. The nonlinear two-dimensional <b>infrared</b> <b>spectrum</b> is a two-dimensional correlation plot of the frequency ω1 that was excited by the initial pump pulses and the frequency ω3 excited by the probe pulse after the waiting time. This allows the observation of coupling between different vibrational modes; because of its extremely fine time resolution, {{it can be used to}} monitor molecular dynamics on a picosecond timescale. It is still a largely unexplored technique and is becoming increasingly popular for fundamental research.|$|E
