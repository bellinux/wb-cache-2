5|$|During the night, Washington {{called a}} council {{of war and}} asked his {{officers}} whether they should stand and fight, attempt to cross the river somewhere, or take the backroads to attack Princeton. Although the idea had already occurred to Washington, he learned from Arthur St. Clair and John Cadwalader that his plan to attack Princeton was indeed possible. Two <b>intelligence</b> <b>collection</b> efforts, both of which came to fruition {{at the end of}} December 1776, supported such a surprise attack. After consulting with his officers, they agreed that the best option was to attack Princeton.|$|E
5|$|One new {{innovation}} {{that took place}} during the campaign was renewed interest in personnel infiltration. This aspect of the PAVN effort had been virtually ignored since the initiation of the Commando Hunt in 1968. An <b>intelligence</b> <b>collection</b> and technical reassessment effort invited the Air Force to make another attempt to force the North Vietnamese pay for their effort in blood instead of in imported supplies and trucks. The result was Island Tree the launching of a personnel anti-infiltration effort during Commando Hunt VII. However, it was too little and far too late.|$|E

5|$|United States {{officials}} had only estimates of its enemy's capabilities; <b>intelligence</b> <b>collection</b> agencies often conflicted with each other. Thanks to {{improvements to the}} trail system (including opening new routes that would connect to the Sihanouk Trail in Cambodia), the amount of supplies transported during 1965 almost equaled the combined total for the previous five years.

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{threatening}} features of the new North Vietnamese build-up was the air defence network that was established within South Vietnam, which by 1975 consisted of twenty-two regiments equipped with radar-controlled gun systems and formidable SA-2 Guideline and shoulder-launched SA-7 Grail anti-aircraft missiles. Such systems posed a major deterrent to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, since its aircraft were not {{equipped to deal with}} such threats. As a result, South Vietnamese aerial interdiction of the communist logistical build-up became almost impossible and reconnaissance flights were held to a minimum.

His intelligence correspondents included Đujić, who disseminated his intelligence reports to the CIA, Konstantin Fotić, the former Yugoslav ambassador to the United States, and Miro Didek, Croat politician Vladko Maček's self-styled intelligence representative in Rome. The intelligence reports were mostly collected from refugees fleeing Yugoslavia and arriving in Italy via Trieste and from émigré groups in Italy and Greece. By 1949, Jevđević claimed to have formed a large network of anti-communist propagandists in Italy and <b>intelligence</b> <b>collection</b> centres in Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. The CIA believed that these claims were exaggerated, if not entirely fictitious. In 1951, Jevđević began printing an anti-communist, pro-Chetnik publication from an unidentified religious institution in Italy.

EF 21 stresses the need for increased persistent <b>intelligence</b> <b>collections</b> capabilities and the optimization of existing assets. Current requirements for Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS) limit usage in non-permissive environments beyond the Area of Operations, contrary to the new demands of EF 21. UGS shortfalls include the technologies in use and the capability of the Marines employing them. The fusion of reconnaissance Marines with commercial state-of-the-art UGS expands the current ground <b>intelligence</b> <b>collections</b> capability to be rapid and adaptable for EF 21.

Analysis of this research consisted of a Systems Engineering approach applied the Doctrine, Organizations, Training, Materials, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities fields for UGS. The result was a new table of organization for the Marines ground sensor platoons, focusing on restructuring these units for operational flexibility, fusion with reconnaissance Marines to extend tactical reach, and technological upgrades to advance all existing UGS capabilities.
