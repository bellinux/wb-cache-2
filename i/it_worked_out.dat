After that, he had the second breathing tube fitted. Even with both tubes fitted, raising the mouthpiece above the regulator increases the delivered pressure of gas and lowering the mouthpiece reduces delivered pressure and increases breathing resistance. As a result, many aqualung divers, when they were snorkeling on the surface to save air while reaching the dive site, put the loop of hoses under an arm to avoid the mouthpiece floating up causing free flow.|$|E

After they dig up the ballot box, Lisa counts the votes, and Homer is shocked to see that the votes put him as the winner. Outraged, he meets his old principal, Dondelinger, in a retirement center, who explains why he had to hide the ballot box: two students had talked their classmates into voting for Homer so that, after he had lost, they could laugh at him all the way through high school.

[...] "They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot."

Chance and Madonna had met before through American recording artist Frank Ocean in a concert and became friends, prompting the singer to accept Jay Z's suggestion.|$|E
500|$|Although Winona Ryder was {{the first}} cast member {{attached}} to the script, Dianne Wiest {{was the first}} to sign on. [...] "Dianne, in particular, was wonderful", Burton said. [...] "She was the first actress to read the script, supported it completely and, because she is so respected, once she had given it her stamp of approval, others soon got interested". When it came to casting the lead role of Edward, several actors were considered; Fox was insistent on having Burton meet with Tom Cruise. [...] "He certainly wasn't my ideal, but I talked to him", Burton remembered. [...] "He was interesting, but I think <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> for the best. A lot of questions came up". Cruise asked for a [...] "happier" [...] ending. Gary Oldman and Tom Hanks turned down the part, the latter in favor of critical and commercial flop The Bonfire of the Vanities. Oldman declined as he found the story absurd, but said of the finished film: [...] "Literally two minutes in, I went, 'Yeah, I get it'. I just got it too late."

500|$|Case {{said she}} was unconcerned about the storyline because the writers had a plan to explain Sharon's behavior. New head writer Josh Griffith told TV Guide that the {{character}} would reach a [...] "total mental breakdown", which would {{take her to the}} edge and beyond before being rebuilt. Griffith said the breakdown would help her find salvation, with a [...] "stronger, more together, more evolved Sharon" [...] emerging. Sharon breaks down at the main house of the Newman ranch, burning it down while under the influence of alcohol. Griffith stated that the damage Sharon has done to the Newman family is [...] "physical, professional and emotional". After seeing a doctor, Sharon is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and begins treatment; however, she is alarmed after discovering she must take prescribed medication, possibly {{for the rest of her}} life. Case was happy with the outcome of the storyline, as were viewers of the show. In January 2013, she told Soap Opera Uncensored, [...] "When Sharon battled her emotional problems, that also took a lot of work but in a different way. Playing someone who is bipolar is very exhausting but <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> perfectly and explained all of Sharon’s past behavior. I applaud Josh for making that decision because I think it makes the most sense considering her history." [...] The actress in addition was pleased that she didn't have to continue justifying Sharon's questionable actions.|$|E

[...] Including Morgan's other scripts for the show, VanDerWerff called his writing [...] "deeply, deeply funny", but said that [...] "Humbug" [...] "may be [...] weakest script". He particularly praised the ending of the episode, saying [...] "there are few other TV writers that would come up with something as haunting and as perfectly understanding of the human condition as the final reveal of who the killer is." [...] Also writing for The A.V. Club in 2010, Zack Handlen called it [...] "a terrific episode ... well-written and odd". Ted Cox of the Daily Herald called [...] "Humbug" [...] "the pivotal episode of The X-Files." [...] Robert Goodwin said of the episode [...] "Talk about offbeat. It's very theatrical and grandiose. The trick was being careful that it didn't become like a bad Vincent Price movie, but <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> well." [...] Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A grade. Reviewers for website IGN named [...] "Humbug" [...] the tenth best standalone X-Files episode of the entire series.

I'm not {{one of those people who}} thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as I can relate to it." [...] During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing... so <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently." ...|$|E

[...] Drivers were also impressed with the car's ability to bump other competitors without causing a spin (bumper heights were equalized due to street car development, and nose-to-rear bumper contact caused spins that pre-1988 cars would not cause), and NASCAR officials were pleased with the improvements in safety.|$|E
