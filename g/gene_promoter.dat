25|$|In many disease processes, such as cancer, <b>gene</b> <b>promoter</b> CpG islands acquire {{abnormal}} hypermethylation, {{which results}} in transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. Alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as {{an important component of}} cancer development. Hypomethylation, in general, arises earlier and is linked to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting, whereas hypermethylation is associated with promoters and can arise secondary to gene (oncogene suppressor) silencing, but might be a target for epigenetic therapy.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the polymerase complex takes place on the <b>gene</b> <b>promoter.</b> The TATA box is one well-studied example of a promoter element that occurs in approximately 10% of genes. It is conserved in many (though not all) model eukaryotes and is found in {{a fraction of the}} promoters in these organisms. The sequence TATA (or variations) is located at approximately 25 nucleotides upstream of the Transcription Start Point (TSP). In addition, there are also some weakly conserved features including the TFIIB-Recognition Element (BRE), approximately 5 nucleotides upstream (BREu) and 5 nucleotides downstream (BREd) of the TATA box.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} tasks of {{transcription}} initiation are to provide RNA polymerase with an {{access to the}} promoter and to assemble general transcription factors with polymerase into a transcription initiation complex. Diverse mechanisms of initiating transcription by overriding inhibitory signals at the <b>gene</b> <b>promoter</b> have been identified. Eukaryotic genes have acquired extensive regulatory sequences that encompass {{a large number of}} regulator-binding sites and spread overall kilobases (sometimes hundreds of kilobases) from the promoter–-both upstream and downstream. The regulator binding sites are often clustered together into units called enhancers. Enhancers can facilitate highly cooperative action of several transcription factors (which constitute enhanceosomes). Remote enhancers allow transcription regulation at a distance. Insulators situated between enhancers and promoters help define the genes that an enhancer can or cannot influence.|$|E

Next, each direct input is assigned to an operator site and different transcription factors can be allowed, or not, to compete for the same operator site, while indirect inputs are given a target. Finally, a function is assigned to each gene, defining the gene's response to a combination of transcription factors (promoter state). The transfer functions (that is, how genes respond to a combination of inputs) can be assigned to each combination of promoter states as desired.|$|E
25|$|In mammals, {{the only}} {{exception}} for this global CpG depletion resides in a specific category of GC- and CpG-rich sequences termed CpG islands that are generally unmethylated and therefore retained the expected CpG content. CpG islands are usually defined as regions with 1) a length greater than 200bp, 2) a G+C content greater than 50%, 3) a ratio of observed to expected CpG greater than 0.6, although other definitions are sometimes used. Excluding repeated sequences, there are around 25,000 CpG islands in the human genome, 75% of which being less than 850bp long. They are major regulatory units and around 50% of CpG islands are located in <b>gene</b> <b>promoter</b> regions, while another 25% lie in gene bodies, often serving as alternative promoters. Reciprocally, around 60-70% of human genes have a CpG island in their promoter region. The majority of CpG islands are constitutively unmethylated and enriched for permissive chromatin modification such as H3K4 methylation. In somatic tissues, only 10% of CpG islands are methylated, {{the majority of them}} being located in intergenic and intragenic regions.|$|E
500|$|Three {{homologous}} genes {{have evolved}} in vertebrates, encoding three muscle type-specific isoforms of TnI. Sequence analysis, immunological distance, and examination of evolutionarily suppressed conformational states {{showed that the}} TnI genes have evolved in close linkage with the genes encoding troponin T (TnT), another subunit of the troponin complex. The fast TnI-fast TnT gene pair represents the original TnI and TnT genes (Fig. 1). The three muscle fiber type-specific TnI-TnT gene pairs were likely originated from a TnI-like ancestor gene that presumably duplicated to form a closely linked fast TnI-like and fast TnT-like gene pair. A later duplication events resulted in emergences of a slow TnI-like and cardiac TnT-like gene pair that was further duplicated to give rise of the present-day slow TnI-cardiac TnT and cardiac TnI-slow TnT gene pairs. The seemingly scrambled ssTnI and cTnI gene pair is actually functionally related as they co-express and form troponin complex in the embryonic heart. The overlapping of enhancer elements of the TnT <b>gene</b> <b>promoter</b> with the upstream TnI gene structure may be {{a critical factor in}} the preservation of the close linkage of TnI and TnT gene pairs ...|$|E

2500|$|DNA {{methylation}} is {{a process}} by which methyl groups {{are added to the}} DNA molecule. Methylation can change the activity of a DNA segment without changing the sequence. When located in a <b>gene</b> <b>promoter,</b> DNA methylation typically acts to repress gene transcription. [...] DNA methylation is essential for normal development and is associated with a number of key processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, repression of transposable elements, aging and carcinogenesis.|$|E

Indeed, MGMT methylation is associated with an improved response to treatment with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics, such as temozolomide.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND The {{complexity}} of DNA {{can be quantified}} using estimates of entropy. Variation in DNA complexity is expected between the <b>promoters</b> of <b>genes</b> with different transcriptional mechanisms; namely housekeeping (HK) and tissue specific (TS). The former are transcribed constitutively to maintain general cellular functions, and the latter are transcribed in restricted tissue and cells types for specific molecular events. It is known that promoter features in the human genome are related to tissue specificity, but this {{has been difficult to}} quantify on a genomic scale. If entropy effectively quantifies DNA complexity, calculating the entropies of HK and TS <b>gene</b> <b>promoters</b> as profiles may reveal significant differences. RESULTS Entropy profiles were calculated for a total dataset of 12, 003 human <b>gene</b> <b>promoters</b> and for 501 housekeeping (HK) and 587 tissue specific (TS) human <b>gene</b> <b>promoters.</b> The mean profiles show the TS promoters have a significantly lower entropy (p< 2. 2 e- 16) than HK <b>gene</b> <b>promoters.</b> The entropy distributions for the 3 datasets show that promoter entropies could be used to identify novel HK genes. CONCLUSION Functional features comprise DNA sequence patterns that are non-random and hence they have lower entropies. The lower entropy of TS <b>gene</b> <b>promoters</b> can be explained by a higher density of positive and negative regulatory elements, required for genes with complex spatial and temporary expression...|$|R

2500|$|Specialized {{software}} tools for statistical analysis {{to determine the}} extent of over- or under-expression of a gene in a microarray experiment relative to a reference state have also been developed to aid in identifying genes or gene sets associated with particular phenotypes. One such method of analysis, known as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), uses a Kolmogorov-Smirnov-style statistic to identify groups of genes that are regulated together. This third-party statistics package offers the user information on the genes or gene sets of interest, including links to entries in databases such as NCBI's GenBank and curated databases such as Biocarta and Gene Ontology. Protein complex enrichment analysis tool (COMPLEAT) provides similar enrichment analysis at the level of protein complexes. The tool can identify the dynamic protein complex regulation under different condition or time points. Related system, PAINT [...] and SCOPE performs a statistical analysis on <b>gene</b> <b>promoter</b> regions, identifying over and under representation of previously identified transcription factor response elements. Another statistical analysis tool is Rank Sum Statistics for Gene Set Collections (RssGsc), which uses rank sum probability distribution functions to find gene sets that explain experimental data. A further approach is contextual meta-analysis, i.e. finding out how a gene cluster responds to a variety of experimental contexts.

40|$|AbstractCurcumin, a {{phenolic}} compound from the curry spice turmeric, exhibits {{a wide range}} of activities in eukaryotic cells, including antiviral effects that are at present incompletely characterized. Curcumin is known to inhibit the histone acetyltransferase activity of the transcriptional coactivator proteins p 300 and CBP, which are recruited to the immediate early (IE) <b>gene</b> <b>promoters</b> of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) by the viral transactivator protein VP 16. We tested the hypothesis that curcumin, by inhibiting these coactivators, would block viral infection and gene expression. In cell culture assays, curcumin significantly decreased HSV- 1 infectivity and IE gene expression. Entry of viral DNA to the host cell nucleus and binding of VP 16 to IE <b>gene</b> <b>promoters</b> was not affected by curcumin, but recruitment of RNA polymerase II to those promoters was significantly diminished. However, these effects were observed using lower curcumin concentrations than those required to substantially inhibit global H 3 acetylation. No changes were observed in histone H 3 occupancy or acetylation at viral IE <b>gene</b> <b>promoters.</b> Furthermore, p 300 and CBP recruitment to IE <b>gene</b> <b>promoters</b> was not affected by the presence of curcumin. Finally, disruption of p 300 expression using a short hairpin RNA did not affect viral IE gene expression.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Aberrant DNA {{methylation}} plays {{important roles}} in carcinogenesis. However, the functional significance of genome-wide hypermethylation and hypomethylation of <b>gene</b> <b>promoters</b> in carcinogenesis currently remain unclear. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Based on genome-wide methylation data for five cancer types, we showed that <b>genes</b> with <b>promoter</b> hypermethylation were highly consistent in function across different cancer types, and so were <b>genes</b> with <b>promoter</b> hypomethylation. Functions related to "developmental processes" and "regulation of biology processes" were significantly enriched with hypermethylated genes but were depleted of hypomethylated genes. In contrast, functions related to "cell killing" and "response to stimulus", including immune and inflammatory response, were associated with an enrichment of hypomethylated genes and depletion of hypermethylated genes. We also observed that some families of cytokines secreted by immune cells, such as IL 10 family cytokines and chemokines, tended to be hypomethylated in various cancer types. These results provide new hints for understanding the distinct functional roles of genome-wide hypermethylation and hypomethylation of <b>gene</b> <b>promoters</b> in carcinogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Genes</b> with <b>promoter</b> hypermethylation and hypomethylation are highly consistent in function across different cancer types, respectively, but these two groups of genes tend to be enriched in different functions associated with cancer. Especially, we speculate that hypomethylation of <b>gene</b> <b>promoters</b> may play roles in inducing immunity and inflammation disorders in precancerous conditions, which may provide hints for improving epigenetic therapy and immunotherapy of cancer...|$|R

40|$|Discovery of cis-regulatory {{elements}} in <b>gene</b> <b>promoters</b> {{is a highly}} challenging research issue in computational molecular biology. This paper presents a novel approach to searching putative cis-regulatory {{elements in}} human promoters by first finding 8 -mer sequences of high statistical significance from <b>gene</b> <b>promoters</b> of humans, mice and drosophila melanogaster respectively, and then identifying the most conserved ones across the three species (phylogenetic footprinting). In this study, a conservation analysis on both closely related species (humans and mice) and distantly related species (humans/mice and drosophila) is conducted not only to examine more candidates but also to improve the prediction accuracy. 124 putative cis-regulatory elements have been yielded and group into 20 clusters. The investigation on the coexistence of these clusters in human <b>gene</b> <b>promoters</b> reveals that SP 1, EGR and NRF- 1 are the dominant clusters appearing in the combinatorial combination of up to five clusters.

This inhibition is mediated through {{the regulation of}} a DNA element present {{in each of these}} <b>gene</b> <b>promoters,</b> that we call the Thymine-rich Insulin Response Element (TIRE). The insulin signalling pathway that results in the inhibition of these <b>gene</b> <b>promoters</b> requires the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase). However, the molecules that connect PI 3 -kinase to these <b>gene</b> <b>promoters</b> are not yet fully defined.
