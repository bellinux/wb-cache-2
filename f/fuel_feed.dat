40|$|Fludized bed {{technology}} is very {{suitable for the}} combustion of biomass. Nevertheless substitution of coal with biomass affects boiler operation and especially dynamics and controllability. Non-homogeneity of biomass and <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding</b> disturbances cause process unstability, such as variations in temperatures and pressures, which reduce lifetime of equipment and structures. Because of process unstability higher air coefficient must be used {{in order to avoid}} CO emissions, which is not economical. Combustion profiles for coal, wood and peat, measured at the VTT Processes Pilot circulating fluidized bed reactor, have been compared. Process stability and char inventories have been studied by the measurements and the model. Biofuels are usually very reactive and their combustion profiles are quite different compared to coals. Because of high reactivity and low char content combustion process with biofuels is very sensitive for <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding.</b> Also low char inventory effect on load changes combined with combustion profile that differs from coals.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding</b> mode (continuous or {{periodic}} with different stand-by/operation time ratios) on carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NO, NOx) concentration values in the flue gas was analysed for coniferous wood pellet firing.

Influence of oxygen concentration and temperature in the combustion chamber on carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide concentrations was presented in diagrams.

40|$|Fuzzy Logic, {{which has}} {{recently}} drawn {{a great deal}} of attention, possesses conceptually the quality of the simplicity. However, its early application relied on trial and error in selecting either the fuzzy membership functions or the fuzzy rules. This made it heavily dependent on expert knowledge, which may not always available. Hence, an adaptive fuzzy logic controller such as Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) removes this stringent requirement. This paper demonstrates the application of ANFIS a nonlinear Multi Input Single Output <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding</b> and combustion system and a controller design for the system with optimization with Genetic Algorithm (GA) [...] An ANFIS model has been developed to determine the exact amount of fuel fed to a combustion chamber. This property is impossible to measure directly, but it is required for improving combustion control. The control of the combustion base on two PI controllers, which were optimized by GA.

40|$|The {{combustion}} {{dynamics of}} coal, wood chips and their mixture is investigated. Load change capability {{and the effect}} of the individual control variables, for example the mixture ratio of different fuels, on pilot-scale CFB boiler dynamics were also studied. Disturbances in <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding</b> cause fluctuations in the flue gas concentrations. Changes in the heating value are possible due to varying moisture content of the fuel. Both these disturbances affect the instantaneous firing rate in a boiler. Also the characteristics of the fuels have to be taken into consideration when designing boiler control systems. When co-firing two fuels with clearly distinct combustion characteristics, direct assumptions based on each fuel's characteristies cannot be made about combustion behaviour of their mixture. Combustion experiments with coal and wood chips and their co-firing were carried out in a pilot-scale CFB reactor (VTT) and a large-scale CFB boiler (Chalmers). A comparison of the combustion in the two different size reactors, provides information about scaling. The combustion responses due to changes in the <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding</b> of the two circulating fluidized beds are analyzed by a dynamic model. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
