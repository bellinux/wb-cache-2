5|$|Local governments {{follow a}} {{modified}} version of the separation of powers used in the national government. An assembly may pass a vote of no confidence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive,</b> in which case the executive must either dissolve the assembly within ten days or automatically lose their office. Following the next election, however, the executive remains in office unless the new assembly again passes a no confidence resolution.|$|E

5|$|Acting on {{recommendations}} from Beckham's commission, legislators helped offset the lost {{revenue from the}} sales tax by raising excise taxes; of particular import was the tax on whiskey, which {{was made possible by}} the repeal of Prohibition in 1935. Legislators also enacted the state's first income tax during the session. Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936. The bill realized significant cost savings by restructuring the state government, reducing the number of boards and commissions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> branch from 133 to 22. Critics pointed out that the act also centralized more {{power in the hands of}} the governor and accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting it.|$|E
5|$|After {{just half}} a year as vice president, Arthur found himself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> mansion due to the {{assassination}} of his predecessor. To the surprise of reformers, Arthur took up the cause of reform, though it had once led to his expulsion from office. He signed the Pendleton Act into law and strongly enforced its provisions. He gained praise for his veto of a Rivers and Harbors Act that would have appropriated federal funds in a manner he thought excessive. He presided over the rebirth of the United States Navy, but was criticized for failing to alleviate the federal budget surplus, which had been accumulating {{since the end of}} the Civil War.|$|E

5000|$|As in many Westminster-style systems, the Government of Ireland Act 1920 did not {{explicitly}} provide {{for such an}} office, but <b>in</b> practice <b>the</b> <b>Executive</b> Committee was headed by a Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. <b>In</b> theory <b>the</b> <b>Executive</b> Committee was not answerable to the House of Commons but held their positions [...] "during the pleasure of <b>the</b> Lord Lieutenant". <b>In</b> practice <b>the</b> <b>Executive</b> Committee was answerable to the elected House of Commons of Northern Ireland. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>Executive</b> Committee stood <b>in</b> a similar relationship to the legislature and Crown (within devolved Northern Ireland) as the UK's Cabinet does to the Crown and Westminster Parliament. <b>The</b> <b>Executive</b> Committee thus played an equivalent constitutional role in relation to Northern Ireland as the UK Cabinet did to the United Kingdom as a whole.|$|R
5|$|Again {{unable to}} get his {{expanded}} gambling proposal past the Senate, Beshear attempted to chip away at the Republican majority in that chamber by appointing some Republican senators to lucrative positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> and judicial branches {{in advance of the}} 2010 General Assembly. Shortly after the special session, Beshear named Republican senator Charlie Borders to the state Public Safety Commission. That appointment set up a special election for Borders' seat, which was won by Democratic senator Robin Webb, reducing the Republican majority to 20–17 with one Independent who usually voted with the Republicans. Following Webb's victory, Beshear appointed Republican senator Dan Kelly to a circuit judgeship, but Republicans held on to that seat in a special election.|$|E
5|$|Blas Fajardo Ople (February 3, 1927 – December 14, 2003) was a Filipino {{journalist}} and politician who held several high-ranking positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> and legislative {{branches of the}} Philippine government, including as Senate President from 1999 to 2000, and as Secretary of Foreign Affairs from 2002 until his death. Perceived as a leftist-nationalist {{at the onset of}} his career in public service, Ople was, in his final years, a vocal supporter for allowing a limited United States military presence in the Philippines, and for American initiatives in the War on Terror including the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.|$|E

5|$|During these years, Harrison {{exhibited}} {{a number of}} personality quirks that became legendary. One was his habit of calling in subordinates to dine with him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> dining room by sending them a blue chip that had the meal's conversational topic written on it. Usually the topics were intellectual rather than related to {{the running of the}} railroad. Another oddity was his refusal to use his railroad pass, which entitled him to free travel. Instead, he personally paid for his commute between his home and the railroad's offices.|$|E

5|$|Marshall's vice {{presidency}} is most remembered for a leadership crisis following a stroke that incapacitated Wilson in October 1919. Because {{of their personal}} dislike for him, Wilson's advisers and wife Edith sought to keep Marshall uninformed about the president's condition {{to prevent him from}} assuming presidential powers and duties. Many people, including cabinet officials and Congressional leaders, urged Marshall to become acting president, but he refused to forcibly assume the presidency for fear of setting a precedent. Without strong leadership <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> branch, the administration's opponents defeated the ratification of the League of Nations treaty and effectively returned the United States to an isolationist foreign policy. Marshall is also the only known Vice President of the United States to have been exclusively targeted in an assassination attempt while in office.|$|E
