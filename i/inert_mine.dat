40|$|Timely {{and rapid}} {{intervention}} to underground combustion events (fires, explosions, and spontaneous combustion) {{is the key}} to the successful control of the mine atmosphere and restoring of a coal mine to production. The focus of this paper is the utilization of a GAG 3 A jet engine system to combat either large out-of-control fires or to render an entire mine inert when access to problem areas is difficult or impossible. This system is based upon a Soviet designed agricultural jet engine which consumes aviation fuel with oxygen (O 2) from the intake air and exhausts combustion gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO 2) and water (H 2 O), along with the nitrogen (N 2) from the air and small amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H 2). The system is designed to approach stoichiometric combustion (ideally, pure burning that scavenges all the oxygen from the intake air). Therefore, these exhaust gases are almost entirely inert gases - i. e., gases which do not contribute to, and in fact, can suppress the combustion process due to the lack of oxygen. Other methods to <b>inert</b> <b>mine</b> areas have been used in the US and internationally, but these methods usually use low flow inertisation equipment or methods. Use of these low-flow inertisation equipment and methods has been successful in proactively rendering gob areas inert and has the ability to inert the entire mine workings.

40|$|Abstract—Electromagnetic {{induction}} spectroscopy (EMIS) is used {{to identify}} a buried metallic object such as a landmine, based on its EMI spectrum. EMIS, however, depends on the object’s electrical conductivity, magnetic permeability, shape, size, depth, and orientation. For a given mine made of specific metals, shape, and size, however, the only variables are the mine’s burial depth and orientation. This paper describes a method of identifying a landmine using a normalized EMIS spectrum, which is indepen-dent of the orientation or depth. We assume that the target is small compared with its distance to or size of the sensor so that the source field at a target is uniform. In this case, the normalized spectrum will be range-independent and, therefore, the target identification is based on only spectral shapes. We have developed and tested an algorithm that matches a normalized EMIS spectrum to those of library targets. We applied the new process to 1) numerically simulated data, 2) experimental data from controlled sites using <b>inert</b> <b>mines,</b> mine simulants, and clutter items, and 3) finally extensive field data collected at a blind test site established by the U. S. Army. Test results show that targets are correctly identified with a misfit of less than 10 %; they also show that 80 % of clutter may be rejected, based on a misfit over 30 %.

40|$|Our {{long term}} goals are: (1) to develop/improve {{inversion}} techniques for normal-incidence sediment classification systems and remotely determine sediment physical and geoacoustic properties and (2) to determine mechanisms responsible for scattering of high-frequency energy. OBJECTIVES Our objectives are to identify mine burial mechanisms {{in shallow water}} environments subject to tidal and wave-induced currents and to test existing predictive burial models with AUV-acquired environmental parameters. These objectives are pursued jointly with the University of South Florida (USF) and Florida Atlantic University (FAU) so as to provide the site characterization and AUV components necessary for the experiment. We must remotely classify sediments for mine burial prediction sing the 2 - 12 kHz chirp subbottom profiler and predict acoustic reverberation using the chirp sidescan system.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Inertisation is used {{to enhance}} the safety of {{underground}} mine areas either to avoid {{the potential for a}} combustion event or to stabilize a situation after an ignition, fire or heating. The primary objective of a recently completed Australian Coal Association Research Program (ACARP) study was to review coal mine inertisation and in particular to focus on use of the Polish mine fire simulation software Ventgraph to gain better understanding of how various inertisation units interact with the complex ventilation behavior underground during a substantial fire. Critical aspects targeted for examination under the project grant included location of the unit for high priority fire positions, size of borehole or pipe range required, time required for inertisation output to interact with and extinguish a fire, effects of seam gases on fire behavior with inertisation present and main fan management. A major accomplishment of the project has been to take findings from the simulation exercises to develop inertisation related modifications to the Ventgraph fire simulation program in conjunction with the Polish program authors. Selected mines were “evaluated or audited”as to the ability to deliver inert gases generated from GAG units to high priority underground fire locations. A coding system has been developed and many potential underground mine fire sources cannot be successfully inertized with the GAG docked at the current specified point; this is particularly so for fires in extended areas of workings or in panels. There is a limit to the ability of the GAG jet engine to deliver exhaust down smaller dimension borehole. There is a need to examine the use of the GAG for production or proactive uses in a wider application in Australian mines responding to recovering from mine fires, spontaneous combustion heating’s, elimination of the potential explosibility of newly sealed gobs or <b>inert</b> <b>mines</b> or mine sections on closure. Some of the current uses of low flow inertisation facilities could be more effectively undertaken with the GAG unit. ...|$|R

40|$|A Kongsberg Simrad EM 3000 multibeam sonar (Kongsberg Simrad, Kongsberg, Norway) {{was used}} to conduct a set of six repeat {{high-resolution}} bathymetric surveys west of Indian Rocks Beach (IRB), just {{to the south of}} Clearwater, FL, between January and March 2003, to observe in situ scour and burial of instrumented <b>inert</b> <b>mines</b> and mine-like cylinders. Three closely located study sites were chosen: two fine-sand sites, a shallow one located in 13 m of water depth and a deep site located in 14 m of water depth; and a coarse-sand site in 13 m. Results from these surveys indicate that mines deployed in fine sand are nearly buried within two months of deployment (i. e., they sunk 74. 5 % or more below the ambient seafloor depth). Mines deployed in coarse sand showed a lesser amount of scour, burying until they present roughly the same hydrodynamic roughness as the surrounding rippled bedforms. These data were also used to test the validity of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS, Gloucester Point, VA) 2 -D burial model. The model worked well in areas of fine sand, sufficiently predicting burial {{over the course of the}} experiment. In the area of coarse sand, the model greatly overpredicted the amount of burial. This is believed to be due to the presence of rippled bedforms around the mines, which affect local bottom morphodynamics and are not accounted for in the model, an issue currently being addressed by the modelers. This paper focuses specifically on two instrumented mines: an acoustic mine located in fine sand and an optical instrumented mine located in coarse sand...|$|R

40|$|With {{the ability}} to image a scene in tens to {{hundreds}} of spectral bands, multispectral and hyperspectral imaging sensors have become powerful tools for remote sensing.

From the test results it is concluded that material identification of buried objects by an instrumented prodder is feasible.

40|$|The JASON Committee at MITRE Corp. was tasked by DARPA {{to inquire}} into {{suitable}} technologies for humanitarian mine detection. Acoustic resonance {{was one of}} the very few technologies that the JASONs determined might be promising for the task, but was as yet unexplored at the time that they conducted their inquiry. The objective of this Seed Money investigation into acoustic resonance was to determine if it would be feasible to use acoustic resonance to provide an improvement to present methods for humanitarian mine detection. As detailed in this report, acoustic resonance methods do not appear to be feasible for this task. Although acoustic resonant responses are relatively easy to detect when they exist, they are very difficult to excite by the non-contact means that must be used for buried objects. Despite many different attempts, this research did not discover any practical means of using sound to excite resonant responses in objects known to have strong resonances. The shaker table experiments did see an effect that might be attributable to the resonance of the object under test, but the effect was weak, and exploited the a priori knowledge of the resonant frequency of the object under test to distinguish it from the background. If experiments that used objects known to have strong acoustic resonances produced such marginal results, this does not seem to be a practical method to detect objects with weak resonances or non-existent resonances. The results of this work contribute to the ORNL countermine initiative. ORNL is exploring several unconventional mine detection technologies, and is proposed to explore others. Since this research has discovered some major pitfalls in non-metallic mine detection, this experience will add realism to other strategies proposed for mine detection technologies. The experiment provided hands-on experience with <b>inert</b> plastic <b>mines</b> under field conditions, and gives ORNL additional insight into the problems of developing practical field-deployable methods of mine detection...|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} {{reviewed}} {{the variety of}} mine inertisation systems available in Australia and their technical specifications. Exercises which involved “evaluation or auditing ” of selected mines as {{to the ability to}} deliver inert gases generated from inertisation units to high priority underground fire locations have been undertaken in a number of mines. These exercises have been built around the use of the fire simulation computer program VENTGRAPH and modelling of fire scenarios in selected different mine layouts. A coding system has been developed from these audit exercises. Designs have been developed to allow delivery of high volumes of <b>inert</b> gases down <b>mine</b> bore holes. A section of the paper has examined considerations presented by the layouts of underground mines developed from surface extraction pits. Inertisation and dilution issues in mine openings create complex situations. Mains headings present a complex ventilation network with often numerous parallel headings, hundreds of cut-throughs and a variety of ventilation control devices. In these complex systems the additional interference from a fire means maintaining control of the movement of inert gas is more difficult than elsewhere in the mine. Some illustrations of these issues are given. Mine fires and heatings are recognised across the world as a major hazard issue. New approaches allowing improvement in understanding their use of inertisation techniques have been examined. The outcome of the project is that the mining industry is in an improved position in their understanding of mine fires, use of inertisation and the use of modern advances to preplan for the handling of possible emergency incidents...|$|R
