50|$|Rabbi Huna said: “Once a man {{committed}} a sin and repeated it, it becomes permissible to him.” (Yoma 86b)The spin might {{enter into a}} chronic phase, where the individual is trapped in related or recurring episodes of an acute criminal spin, or a sequential development of criminal, deviant, or violent activity. A chronic criminal spin is manifested {{in the development of}} a criminal lifestyle or career, as well as in repetitive patterns of criminal or offensive behavior. For example, research on problem <b>gambler</b> <b>s</b> describes a characteristic chronic spin, a process wherein the gamblers delve into a world of gambling that increasingly comes to rule their lives, while their ability to get out of the spin decreases as the process goes on. The chronic spin is accompanied by secondary, ever-intensifying, behaviors that serve as a cover-up (for example, some of the gamblers also have recourse to deception and drug use). It should be pointed out that there are periods in which the individual is not involved in any criminal activity or deviance, but behaves in a normative way like everyone else.

40|$|Successful mineral {{exploration}} strategy requires identification {{of some of}} the risk sources and considering them in the decision-making process so that controllable risk can be reduced. Risk is defined as chance of failure or loss. Exploration is an economic activity involving risk and uncertainty, so risk also must be defined in an economic context. Risk reduction can be addressed in three fundamental ways: (1) increasing the number of examinations; (2) increasing success probabilities; and (3) changing success probabilities per test by learning. These provide the framework for examining exploration risk. First, the number of prospects examined is increased, such as by joint venturing, thereby reducing chance of gambler 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ruin.</b> Second, success probability is increased by exploring for deposit types more likely to be economic, such as those with a high proportion of world-class deposits. For example, in looking for 100 + ton (> 3 million oz) Au deposits, porphyry Cu-Au, or epithermal quartz alunite Au types require examining fewer deposits than Comstock epithermal vein and most other deposit types. For porphyry copper exploration, a strong positive relationship between area of sulfide minerals and deposits 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 contained Cu can be used to reduce exploration risk by only examining large sulfide systems.

40|$|In {{this essay}} Crowley explores the {{political}} {{symbolism of the}} ruin in the Polish capital from 1944 to the present. The question of what a war ruin might represent was deeply problematic for the communist authorities, not least because fragments of buildings and streets {{could be used to}} remember prohibited and unsanctioned aspects of the Warsaw’s history. Viewed in this light, the reconstruction of the historic fabric of the city most notably {{in the case of the}} Royal Castle in the 1970 s can be interpreted as an attempt to fix and ultimately to narrow the meanings attached to places in the popular imagination. Reconstruction could be a kind of forgetting.

Often overlooked: the giant Confederate flag flying over I- 4; {{the fact that the}} sand that makes up Miami Beach is actually imported regularly; that some days it 2 ̆ 7 s sunny in the front yard while it rains out back. Florida is a weird, wonderful state. There 2 ̆ 7 s no other state like it. We 2 ̆ 7 re in the geographical south, but we 2 ̆ 7 re not The South. We kayak with alligators and find iguanas on our porches and hit the rinse cycle when roaches show up in our dishwashers. We have palm trees (California borrowed a few). We are a peninsula. We are the home of the Skunk Ape. We are Hemingway 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 last wilderness, 2 ̆ 2 land of the Hanging Chad. We aren 2 ̆ 7 t perfect. But we try to market ourselves that way. For all of its attempts to draw tourists in with postcards of beautiful beaches and tropical escapes [...] for all of its attempts to be a paradise [...] Florida is a place as environmentally troubled as any other state, and its inhabitants struggle with death, love, money, and loss just as all human beings do. My goal in writing this collection was to tackle the outside perceptions, and truths, of my home state. I want readers to leave the text with a sense of the state, and its people, that exists beyond the Sandals 2 ̆ 7 commercials. These stories are meant to dispel the caricature of Florida 2 ̆ 7 s environment and its inhabitants and express them, instead, as full-bodied and inseparable from one another. Florida 2 ̆ 7 s people contribute to its environmental degradation and suffer from it. A healthy environment means healthy people, be it physically or mentally. The range of characters, points-of-view, styles, and places add, I think, to an established tradition of collections situated in a world on the cusp of environmental breakdown [...] books that wrap conservation, environmental justice, and the inevitably flawed nature of human beings up in story. I 2 ̆ 7 ve long admired the work of George Saunders, Karen Russell, Etgar Karet, Rick Bass, and TC Boyle, all of whom tackle environmental issues and situate those ideas (and, often, commentaries) within a compelling human narrative. I 2 ̆ 7 ve attempted to add my voice to this conversation. This collection also finds its place within the tradition of Florida writing. Authors such as Karen Russell, Carl Hiassen, and Zora Neale Hurston write extensively about the Floridian environment and its people, always working aspects of environmental awareness and environmental justice seamlessly into an engaging narrative. They make their audience care about the environment through storytelling. I hope that my collection does the same. As a Floridian, I am surprised at how rarely I come across literary stories about Florida, or even set in Florida. My home state is rich territory for story, yet it is often overlooked in fiction. Some historical moments of note: * After draining 50, 000 acres of the Kissimmee River Valley for agriculture, drainage pioneer Hamilton Disston committed suicide in Philadelphia. Florida 2 ̆ 7 s landscape, though fertile, proved difficult to manage and drove him into debt. * In the late 1880 s, Florida was prime hunting ground for poachers in the North American feather trade. Over 130, 000 snowy egrets were killed for this purpose. * Hurricane Andrew hit Miami in 1992, freeing numerous nonnative animals from the Miami MetroZoo: pythons, monkeys, Asian birds, crocodiles, antelope. They wandered the streets and picked their way through the city 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ruins.</b> * Recently, Florida 2 ̆ 7 s oldest tree was burned down by a woman smoking meth beneath it. These moments beg to be encapsulated in fiction. Florida 2 ̆ 7 s environmental story is complicated, nuanced, and deeply rooted in its people. This is a gap in Florida writing that I want my stories to fill. This collection is the result of three years of careful research and thought. As a Florida native, I 2 ̆ 7 ve taken deliberate care with how I represent my home state. It 2 ̆ 7 s taken eight, nine, sometimes upwards of ten revisions of each story to achieve the honesty I hope comes across in the collection as a whole. Florida is a beautiful state, but I did not want to portray it as pretty. Pretty is a postcard, is two-dimensional. Beauty acknowledges flaws, thus becoming fuller, more layered. Beauty insinuates love of a place and its people despite, or even because of, those flaws. This collection has grown (at one point I had a novella in mind) and shrunk (no more novella, no more flash fiction pieces, several stories cut). The tone has shifted from being completely absurdist in nature (an early title was Till Magic Kingdom Come) to being a book with a funny bone: it is human nature to wince and laugh at the same time. In a sense, this is the book I came to Iowa to write. Amid cornfields I learned about swamps and beaches and have been able to put into words the love and disappointment I feel for Florida, my home place...|$|R
40|$|During {{the first}} half of this century, physiologists, physicians, and psychologists began to realize that {{stressful}} events experienced by individuals over the course of their lives were in some manner related to overall physical and psychological well-being. It was noted, however, that not all individuals who were exposed to high levels of stress developed symptoms of stress-induced somatic or psychological illness. As a consequence, a more recent trend in stress-illness outcome research involves attempts to determine the situational, personality, and constitutional factors that account for these differences in reactions to stress;At no time since the worldwide depression of the early 1930 s have farmers, as a group, experienced financial difficulty as severe as that produced by economic events of the decade of the 1980 <b>s.</b> That economic <b>ruin</b> or near-ruin is a profound source of stress in the lives of farmers is now apparent. This study examined the contingency factors explaining, at least in part, why some Iowa farmers have experienced occupational stress-induced somatic and psychological dysfunction and others have not;The specific personality and situational factors hypothesized to moderate the occupational stress-illness outcome relationship for farmers were social support, coping, hardiness, and Type A behavior pattern. The results achieved indicated that coping, as measured in this study, was a two-dimensional construct consisting of both effective behaviors and behaviors (smoking, eating, and drinking more) which might exacerbate illness. Moderated multiple regression analyses revealed that these ineffective coping behaviors moderated the stress-physical health relationship for farmers, as did effective (cognitive and behavioral) coping, and hardiness. Social support was found to moderate only the stress-mental health relationship. Additionally, path analysis showed that avoidant (ineffective) coping mediated the relationship between work stress and mental health for Iowa farmers. Type A behavior pattern was found to have essentially no impact on the stress illness outcome for farmers...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{traces the}} ways in which history was imagined in the 18 th and 19 th centuries in the New World. By looking at non-professional history writers of the period—such as poets, fiction writers, linguists, politicians, and especially explorer/archaeologists—I have found that the past has been imagined and organized in no one way, and that the turn to archaeological and other material objects from the 2 ̆ 2 past 2 ̆ 2 consistently exerted power over the development of different ways for creating historical narratives. My main claim is that the belief objects 2 ̆ 2 tell stories 2 ̆ 2 and provide unparalleled access to the past can be tracked to the national and imperial ambitions of creoles in the newly independent New World nations. While refuting European claims that, before colonization, there was 2 ̆ 2 no history 2 ̆ 2 in the New World, these new stories of the past from America 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> buried or <b>ruined</b> objects insisted that the past Europeans couldn 2 ̆ 7 t see was, in fact, very old and left by peoples long gone. This move cleared the imaginative space for new American citizens to set themselves apart from former colonial centers, but also, assisted in the various practices of extermination and denigration that eventually 2 ̆ 2 proved 2 ̆ 2 that only objects, not people, provided access to history. My secondary claim is that these practices of reading objects for history, and using them to construct and define different 2 ̆ 2 cultures, 2 ̆ 2 have persisted into 20 th- and 21 st-century material and cultural studies, and are thus still employing a centuries-old imperialist logic that ultimately reinforces uneven structures of power. ...|$|R

The study {{examines how}} to use legends, construction archaeological surveys and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) as source material, and use them against each other to ensure the reliability they have. As a starting point I used Gräfsnäs castle ruin in Alingsås, Sweden, as an example. Gräfsnäs castle was probably built in the Middle Ages and was rebuilt through the ages until it became a ruin in the late 1800 <b>s.</b> The castle <b>ruin</b> is today Alingsås most visited attraction. The investigation has focused on three areas which {{are located in the}} very ruin; rescue tunnels, the cellar vault and the treasure. There are legends that describe how the castle lord of Gräfsnäs fled an attack of the Danes in 1612 in a rescue tunnel which ended at the beach. At the construction archaeological surveys carried out in 1935 - 36 they found a sewer in the courtyard that was once served as rescue tunnel and ended in the moat. The GPR survey conducted in March 2008 located the rescue tunnel is probably still intact on the part of its former extent. Another legend describes that they found the cellar vault when they broke down the remnants of wings in the courtyard. Under a tower barrels of beer were found in the cellar and the legend said to be "very tasty". The construction archaeological surveys found residues of the tower, but no observations were made of some cellar vault. GPR study found several architectural remnants in the courtyard - such as floor levels and a well but no cellar vault was located. The third described legends about a "tremendous treasure" which is said to be buried in entrance hall. The construction of archaeological excavations dug no more than a ditch in entrance hall so it located no treasure here. GPR investigation argues that in the middle of entrance hall is a large unknown object. The thesis shows that in many cases there is evidence it is likely that there is something behind the legends which were examined.

It analyzes the do 1 nesticating effects of Elliott 2 ̆ 7 s and Mardiganian 2 ̆ 7 s texts that) in the fanner, solidify uniform and mutually unrelatable experiences in 2 ̆ 7 the Orient 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 America, 2 ̆ 2 and in the latter, sensationalize and corrunodify tratunatic experience, while it argues that Yesayan 2 ̆ 7 s translation violates the fluency of language in order. to signify the foreignness of traumatic experience. Chapter three analyzes the ways in which Micheline Aharonian Marcon 1 ·s novel The Daydreaming Boy (2004) conveys traumatic survival through a 2 ̆ 2 foreignizing 2 ̆ 2 translation of the experience of genocide orphans and problen 1 atizes American missionary progressivism and its disciplinary ideology of 2 ̆ 2 character building. 2 ̆ 2 The chapter discusses how Marcom interrogatively mediates, akin to William Faulkner and Toni Morrison, a history of silenced voices. The final chapter focuses on a translation-centered pedagogy and offers modes for rethinking the design of global and comparative literature courses in such a way that requires a double orientation, centering not only on the foreign experience and culture, but also the invisible power relations and hierarchies within the translating culture...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissolution}} of the Congrès Internationaux d 2 ̆ 7 Architecture Moderne in 1959 was a critical and symbolic moment of transition that opened up possibilities for exploring new approaches to urbanism. The pursuit of new urbanism in Japan {{in the postwar period}} often took the form of utopian speculations that reflected currents of socio-ideological changes and diverse local conditions. This dissertation examines the issue of utopianism in contemporary urbanism through an investigation of the Japanese Metabolist movement, and in particular, Tange Kenzo 2 ̆ 7 s works of urban design in the 1960 s. It aims to situate this avant-garde movement in the context of Japan 2 ̆ 7 s postwar urban reconstruction, rapid economic growth and socio-political transformation, and argues that the Metabolists 2 ̆ 7 futuristic concepts, which often envisioned the sea and the sky as human habitats of the future, were in fact the architects 2 ̆ 7 response to the particular urban and cultural crises that confronted Japanese society in the postwar era. ^ The dissertation traces the evolution of the Metabolist movement from its inception at the World Design Conference in 1960 to its spectacular swansong at the Osaka World Exposition in 1970. Based on a metaphor of the city as an organic process, the Metabolists rejected the Modernist planning methods to embrace a structuralist approach featuring a series of radical concepts such as marine civilization, artificial terrain, and metabolic cycle. Two ramifications of urban forms, however, arose from Metabolism 2 ̆ 7 s emphasis on the change and transformation of cities: the megastructure and the group form. They represented drastically different responses to the problems of modern city. Through discussions of Maki Fumihiko 2 ̆ 7 s concept of group form, Isozaki Arata 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> notion of <b>ruin,</b> Kikutake Kiyonori and Kurokawa Noriaki 2 ̆ 7 s ideas of technology, Otaka Masato 2 ̆ 7 s employment of artificial ground, and Kawazoe Noboru 2 ̆ 7 s theory on tradition, this study attempts to provide a more comprehensive view on Metabolism that was characterized by diverse, complex, and even contradictory points of view, rather than a monotonous megastructural movement as usually portrayed in historical accounts. Its development involved debates of utopia and anti-utopia. ^ The utopian nature of Metabolism was manifested in Tange 2 ̆ 7 s seminal works during the 1960 s: the Plan for Tokyo, Yamanashi Communications Center, the Redevelopment Plan for Skopje, and the Osaka Expo. The 1960 Plan for Tokyo represented a sophisticated synthesis of the Metabolist concepts on an unprecedented scale. Serving as a polemical alternative to the official plans of Tokyo, this project posed itself to fundamentally transform its urban structure for the imminent arrival of a post-industrial age, and heralded the architect 2 ̆ 7 s later works. The megastructural solutions in these projects betrayed technocratic notion of Tange, who attempted to control the process of urban and social development with predetermined patterns and technological means. This was coupled with his symbolic representation of urban and political ideals, which nevertheless remained unattainable in fact. ...|$|R

Njegova slika poslužila je za izradu drvoreza objavljenog 1883. i 1890. u knjizi o Jadranu Amanda Schweiger-Lerchenfelda. Osim toga u članku se navode i drugi umjetnički prikazi Salone/Solina do sredine 19. stoljeća, a na kraju objavljuje tekst o Saloni Ide von Düringsfeld koji prati spomenutu litografiju. In {{the late}} 2015, at an auction {{organised}} by the Paris auction house Expertissim appeared an {{oil on canvas}} painting attributed to the 19 th century Austrian painting school, and the painter CH (Ecole autrichienne du XIXème siècle, CH***) whose initials appear in the bottom left corner (C. H. Salone. 6. 9. 61.), whereas the bottom right corner reads Dalmatia (Dalmatie). The painting is titled »View of Solin in Dalmatia« (Vue du site de Salona en Dalmatie). Thanks {{to the efforts of}} Mrs. Flora Turner-Vučetić and Mr. Joško Belamarić, PhD, the painting has been bought by the City of Solin, thus further enriching the collection of the Solin City Art Gallery. From two lithographs showing Salona and Split, published in the Leipzig magazine Illustrirte Zeitung and kept in the Archaeological Museum in Split, we have revealed the initials CH in the painting to stand for Carl (Karl) Haase, born in Berlin in 1820, from where he moved to Trieste, Italy, where he opened a private painting and drawing school in 1950 s, and where he died before the year 1877. In the early 1860 s, Haase travelled along the Adriatic eastern coast, making drawings of several towns, from Muggia, Italy, in the north to Kotor, Montenegro, in the south. From his drawings were made the pictures published in Illustrirte Zeitung from March 1865 till May 1868. The pictures were accompanied with articles describing the presented places. In this period of time published were fifteen lithographs made after the Haase 2 ̆ 7 s drawings. The one showing Salona was published in the volume XLVIII, number 1230, of 26 January 1867, on the page 64, whereas the text entitled Salona and signed I. v. D. was published on the pages 63 and 66. The Haase 2 ̆ 7 s drawing was also used in making the wood engraving published in 1882 and 1890 in the book on the Adriatic written by Amand Schweiger-Lerchenfeld. The Haase 2 ̆ 7 s painting of Salona has been made in oil on canvas and dated 6 September 1861. It is 54. 5 x 83. 5 cm in size (frame opening 41. 7 x 71. 5 cm). On its back there is an insufficiently legible text. In the front shown are parts of the amphitheatre with its seatings and remains of the arches by the main entrance (Porta pompae). This is a view from west to east, that is very well evident by comparing it with old photographs. In the second plan is baptistery of which recognised are its polygonal shape and the baptising font, situated by the city basilica. The Haase 2 ̆ 7 s picture essentially agrees with the photograph made in 1874 by Franz Thiard de Laforest, and published in his book in 1878. In the centre of the picture, in the distance, shown are houses of Solin, with poplar-trees along the Jadro river, and the church bell tower as a recognisable symbol of a settlement. However, this detail is inaccurate, because the local church of Our Lady of the Islet had no high bell tower but a little bell-cot above the facade, as seen in the watercolour painting made by Petar Zečević around 1840. The church of Our Lady was destroyed in fire in 1875. The new one was built and completed in 1878, whereas its bell tower was erected only in 1907. The entire scene is closed with mounts Kozjak and Mosor, between which, on its cliff, stands the fort Klis. The picture of the Salonitan ruins by Carl Haase is among the oldest artistic presentations of Salona/Solin. Salona can be followed from the map of Split and its surroundings made by Martin Kolunić around 1570, and the view published in the book by Wilhelm Dilich in 1609. From the 17 th and the 18 th centuries preserved are several maps of Solin, and drawings of particular localities and monuments also started appearing. In the mid 18 th century created was the first, though fantastic, reconstruction of appearance of the Roman metropolis of Dalmatia, by rev. Vicko Paterni, printed in 1751. Of the artists who presented Salona, mentioning deserve the French painters Charles Louis Clérisseau and Louis François Cassas. Of ceerain artistic quality are also drawings made by the assistants to Francesco Carrara, who produced field documentation (plans and drawings) for him: the Austrian captain-lieutenant Carl Mohr von Ehrenfeld and Franjo Bratanić of Split. A contribution to the iconography of the Solin area was also made by the painter of Split, Petar Zečević. In 1840 to Dalmatia was visited by the Austrian painters Jakob and Rudolf Alt (father and son) who made a number of drawings with motifs of this part of the Adriatic. Jakob has, among others, drawn Solin (viewed from the left bank of the Jadro) and Klis, as well as the Diocletian 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> aqueduct. The <b>ruins</b> of Salona could not have been resisted by the German painter Eugen Adam either, who stayed in Split in 1846. He visited Solin and drew Roman ruins and the aqueduct. In 1854 Solin was visited by the German painter Carl Haag who also painted the aqueduct, but the baptistery excavated by Carrara as well. We know from literature that Haag in an exhibition of 1855 exhibited also a painting of the ruins of Salona with a group of people of the Dalmatian hinterland (the Morlacks) listening to an old singer singing on the fall of Salona. In 1858 these artists were joined by the Belgian painter Jan (Jean) Baptiste van Moer, who made a few drawings of remains of the Roman architecture of Salona and a drawing of the Parać Mansion. It is evident from this review of iconography of the Salona/Solin area that the painting by Carl Haase takes an important place, that is to become even more prominent in a future body of representations of Solin in old drawings, paintings and engravings, moreover so since many of these pieces are abroad today. At the end of the article published and commented is the article by the German writer, Ida von Düringsfeld, that is accompanying the Haase 2 ̆ 7 s lithograph in Illustrirte Zeitung...|$|R

Marte kod Trogira; najprije početkom 20. stoljeća u vrijeme prvih iskopavanja i potom u revizijskim nastojanjima krajem lO-tih godina istoga stoljeća. Otim spomenicima do sada je više puta pisano, a povodi za to bili su različiti. Uočljiva su oprečna mišljenja opitanju njihove stilske i vremenske pripadnosti. Udosadašnjim prijedlozima kreću se vrlo široko, od 6. do 12. stoljeća, dakle, od kasnoantičkoga do ranoromaničkoga razdoblja. Našim pokušajem nastoji se osnažiti pretpostavka da je u ovom slučaju riječ o ranosrednjovjekovrtim skulpturama iz kraja 8. ili samog početka 9. stoljeća. The paper {{deals with}} a group of unskilfully cut relieves, {{excavated}} on two occasions (in the early 20 th ct., and during the revising excavations in the 1970 <b>s)</b> among the <b>ruins</b> of the St. Martha 2 ̆ 7 s Church (Sv. Marta) near Trogir, that made part of the Croatian rulers 2 ̆ 7 court in the early Middle Ages (villa Biaci, as referred to by the historic sources, was built on top of the remains of a Roman villa rustica). The relieves were made at various parts of the altar rail (plutei, pilasters, capitals, beams and arched gables) and at a lintel. The main decoration, appearing in various combinations at almost all the fragments, are sequences of concentric circles, single-and multi-switch laces made into braids, with a dot bulge or a small cross in the middle, and double-switch curfs with trefoil ending and a cross in the middle. The dominating motives at the plutei are the large multi-switch crosses with stylised palmettes below and rosettas ofvarious forms above their horizontal arms. These artefacts have been written about several times,Jor various reasons. There are confronting opinions about their stylistic and chronological affiliation. In the present-day proposals, they range very widely,from the 6 th to the 12 th centuries, thus,from the late-classical to the early-Romanesque periods. Here it is attempted to enforce the theses on these being early-medieval seulptures o ft he late (fh or {{the very beginning of the}} 9 th century. In a review of all the opinions presented on the tapie by abut a dozen oj authors since 1930, particularly emphasized are the efforts ojLj. Karaman, B. Gabričević, Ž. Rapanić and T. Burić. In 1930, Lj. Karaman presented his thesis on the seulptures originating from the 12 th century, and indicating a rebuilding of the St. Martha 2 ̆ 7 s Church (with the change of its dedication to St. John) performed, according to a 1197 written source, by the local peasants who, at the time, already formed a settlement there. He also deems that they make clear and unique evidencesproving that the interlaced sculptural decoration in the then rural Croatia lasted much longer then in towns, the latterfollowing development of the arts in the neighbouring Italy In 1956, B. Gabričević analysed similar ornaments at the then discovered pluteum of Gala, in the Sinj Field. He does not present a precise dating, however, he was the first to assume that the pluteum, together with the similarly decorated fragments ofBijaći to which he compared it, should be dated to the centuries between the last classical period and the times prior to the early-medieval interlaced art. In 1987, Ž. Rapanić discussed generally the art of the preRomanesque epoque in Dalmatia. Searchingfor its roots in the previous centuries, he assumed that the Jragments oj the St. Martha 2 ̆ 7 s Church, just like the similar Dalmatian artefacts, belonged to the second half of the 7 th century. In 1993, T. Burić assumed, while taking into account casual conclusions made by other authors, that these seulptures, together with several other examples similar by style, oj Trogir, Solin (Gradina and Otok) and the Sinj Field (Trilj and Gala), and of Crkvina in Biskupija near Knin, make a unique cultural circle. He deems this regional group of ornaments, the common characteristic of which is unskilful stone cutting and peculiar artistic expression, should be dated after the "classic" paleo-Christian sculpture, and certainly before the pre-Romanesque one. He assumes that the fragments belong to the first half of the 7 th century, and make products ofthe "last stone-cutters of Salona/ who worked immediately before moving ofthe then ecclesiastical centre from Salona to Split. He deems, thus, that this group of artefacts is, in general, a closer regionalfeature, territorially limited to the diocese of Salona. In the results ofthe past analyses ofthe St. Martha relieves, this paper emphasizes as a common characteristic the lack ofskill and proper training of their authors, as well as the stylistically defined group of similar artefacts discovered in the past at several of the already mentioned sites in Dalmatia. These are to be added some further artefacts from the Šuplja crkva and Gradina ofSolin and, as pointed out, some from the farther Dalmatian hinterland, from the present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina (sculptures from the churches ofZenica and Dabravina). While discussing the sty!istic and stonecutting characteristics of all these seulptures, particularly those of the St. Martha 2 ̆ 7 s Church, particular attention is paid to the dominant decorative motives: the multi-switch crosses and braids, and curls with trefoil and cross ornaments in the middle. The author turns attention to their numerous analogies with stylistically similar artefacts ofthe Istrian and the Apennine peninsulas, particularly among the rnstic relieves dated to the 82 ̆ 7 -h and the very beginning ofthe !Jh centuries. Attention is also turned to the fact that, at the same time at the Apennine Peninsula, similar ornaments were also cut at relieves that made the very top of the contemporary art. Among several such examples, particular attention is paid to the sarcophagus of Buggi, of the ffh century, and very similar ornaments decorating the lateral sides ofthe cathedras ofCividale and Sesto al Reghena, of the second half of the ffh century, as well as those of the ciborium of St. Eleucadia in the church of S. Apolinare in Classe in Ravenna, made between the years 806 and 810. These better cut Italian sculptures are finely comparable to two very Similarly decorated ones in Dalmatia: the fragment of the altar ciborium of Trogir and the very finely decorated pluteum of the Zadar cathedral. The fact that in the ffh century similar motives were being cut at both rustic relieves and those ofhigh stonecutting quality simultaneously at both the East-Adriatic coast and its hinterland as well as in Italy, brings into doubt the previously presented conclUSions, that the Dalmatian rnstic sculptures make later and unskilful products of the stonecutting workshops that worked follOWing the models of those in urban centres. However, it appears acceptable the thesis that the Dalmatian 82 ̆ 7 -h centU 1 Y sculpture, in its entire complexity, makes a complete image ofthe contemporary events in the European art, especially in the Italian one. Very like and, probably, contemporary ornamental motives are, thus, produced in both analysed areas -Dalmatia and Italy. The fact that in Dalmatia they are made in a somewhat different stonecutting treatment may indicate their regional production, however, most probably the same models and schemes being followed in both communities. The same ornamental group ofsculptures found in the St. Martha 2 ̆ 7 s Church is to be added also the fragment of a decorated architrave with remains of the inscription reading CA [...] . IUP[anus (-ana?) and [. [...] ChrORATORV(m) ET [...] Since this fragment, too, certainly belongs to the end ofthe [fh or the very beginning of the gh centuries, there is the logical conclusion that the fragment from the St. Martha 2 ̆ 7 s Church has brought to us the presently oldest known artefact stating a Croatian ethnic and, thus, the oldest presently known record of a župan (viceroy) in the early-medieval Croatia. Since at the locality of Bijaći there have been excavated remains of two ecclesiastical buildings in two layers (the earlier > paleo-Christian, and the later early-medieval), it iseventually also 2 ̆ 7. ! discussed the issue of which of them stood as a sacral building in (the early Middle Ages and which of them was decorated with the seulptures discussed in the paper. Following a briefreview ofresults ofthe researches performed so far and other opinions presented on the topicS, it is concluded that the first early-medieval church ofSt. Martha was a simple, three-vessel, three-trave, three-apse church, the vessels being mutually separated with square, masonry py!ons, the first pylon leaned against the inner side of the western wall, and the fourth against the triumphal arch of the large, central, square apse, in the way that it, at one side and with the ais!e flat wall surfaces, forms smaller lateral square apses, and at the other side further deepens and monumentalises the central apse space. With such basic ground plan, the St. Martha 2 ̆ 7 s Church is very close to the St. Mary 2 ̆ 7 s Church at Biskupija near Knin. It is also interesting that both churches are early-medieval structures built at the end ofthe 82 ̆ 7 b century as parts ofthe then Croatian sovereigns 2 ̆ 7 residentiaI complexes. Namely, in such an environment, churches with such emphasized central apse were well justified since they could occasionally have been used as halls for performing ofvarious royal jobs (aula regis), in line with the contemporary European practice. From all that issaid above results that the St. Martha 2 ̆ 7 s Church makes apart ofan architectural complex ofutmost importancefor the Croatian early-medieval sculpture, which, besides very important fragments ofthe early-medieval sculpture ofthe end ofthe 82 ̆ 7 h or the very beginning ofthe gh centuries, also produced the so far the earliest known information on the then Croats in their new country...|$|R
