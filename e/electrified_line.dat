25|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Victorian Railways {{embarked}} on an £80 million program dubbed ‘Operation Phoenix’ to rebuild a network badly run down by years of Depression-era underinvestment and wartime overutilisation. This included a substantial upgrade (regrading, rerouting and electrification) of the Gippsland line servicing Victoria's substantial brown coal fields in the Latrobe Valley to allow for greatly increased traffic in briquettes for industrial use. A suitably powerful electric locomotive was sought for both express passenger and heavy freight use on the upgraded, <b>electrified</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

25|$|Continued {{success and}} {{profitability}} of its earliest projects caused the LB {{to decide to}} electrify all remaining London suburban lines in 1913.

During 1920 plans were drawn up to extend the 'Elevated Electric' to Brighton, Worthing, Eastbourne, Newhaven and Seaford, and to Epsom and Oxted, but these were overtaken by the Grouping.|$|E

New dual-voltage rolling stock was required for the service on account of differing electrification standards north and south of London; lines south of the river are electrified using a 750-volt third rail and those to the north by the more modern 25kV overhead system. Services began in 1988 and the route was fully inaugurated in May 1990.|$|E
