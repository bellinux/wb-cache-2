To ensure the authenticity of the resulting artefacts and the validity of the migration, quality as-surance is essential. For large-scale migration, automated qual-ity assurance processes are an essential prerequisite. This paper focuses on the migration processes of born-digital photographs. We describe the particular requirements for successful automa-tion of quality assurance. A key aspect of this is the authenticity of the image, the fidelity of the rendering as it appears to an ex-pert viewer. Automation requires us to substitute the human <b>expert</b> <b>viewer</b> with a software algorithm. The key question is whether ex-isting image comparison mechanisms can be applied. To address it, we introduce a publicly available automated workflow relying on perceptual quality assurance measures and present an experi-ment testing the correlation of the automated measures to human perception...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} the compression of grayscale medical ultrasound images using a recent compression technique, i. e., space-frequency segmentation (SFS). This method finds the rate-distortion optimal representation {{of an image}} from a large set of possible space-frequency partitions and quantizer combinations and is especially effective when the images to code are statistically inhomogeneous, which {{is the case for}} medical ultrasound images. We implemented a compression application based on this method and tested the algorithm on representative ultrasound images. The result is an effective technique that performs better than a leading wavelet-transform coding algorithm, i. e., set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT), using standard objective distortion measures.

40|$|Rationale and Objectives. The authors {{performed}} {{this study}} to assess {{the performance of a}} computer-based classification system that uses gaze locations of observers to define the subspace for machine learning. Materials and Methods. Thirty-two dental radiographs were classified by an <b>expert</b> <b>viewer</b> into four categories of disease of the periapical region: no disease (normal tooth), mild disease (widened periodontal ligament space), moderate disease (destruction of the lamina dura), and severe disease (resorption of bone in the periapical area). There were eight images in each category. Six observers independently viewed the images while their eye gaze position was recorded. They then classified the images into one of the four categories. A sample of image space was used as input to a machine learning routine to develop a machine classifier. Sample space was determined with three techniques: visual gaze, random selection, and constrained random selection. � analyses were used to compare classification accuracies with the three sampling techniques. Results. With use of the expert classification as a standard of reference, observers classified images with 57 % accuracy, and the machine classified images with 84 % accuracy by using the same gaze-selected features and image space. Results of � analyses revealed mean values of 0. 78 for gaze-selected sampling, 0. 69 for random sampling, 0. 68 for constrained random selection, and 0. 44 for observers. The use of sample space selected with the visual gaze technique was superior to that selected with both random-selection techniques and by the observers. Conclusion. Machine classification of dental images improves the accuracy of individual observers using gaze-selecte...|$|E
30|$|While {{previewing}} an expert’s eye movements {{can facilitate}} interpretive {{performance on the}} same or very similar cases, {{it is unclear whether}} EMMEs are supporting strategy development that will transfer to dissimilar cases. Transfer describes the ability to apply knowledge, skills and abilities to novel contexts and tasks that have not been previously experienced (Bransford, Brown, & Cocking, 2000). Transfer can be relatively near-transfer versus far-transfer (Barnett & Ceci, 2002), and is considered a critical trademark of successful learning (Simon, 1983). An example of near-transfer might be a pathologist learning the features and rules for diagnosing DCIS on one case or from text-book examples, and transferring that knowledge and skill to a biopsy with similar features that clearly indicate DCIS (Roads, Xu, Robinson, & Tanaka, 2018). An example of relatively far-transfer would be successfully applying knowledge and skill to a novel biopsy with a unique cellular architecture and challenging features that are less clearly indicative of DCIS and are perhaps borderline between atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and DCIS. More research is needed to understand whether EMMEs promote only near-transfer, or whether multiple EMME experiences can promote relatively far-transfer by promoting perceptual differentiation of features, accurate feature recognition, and more accurate and efficient mapping of features to candidate diagnoses. In other words, can EMMEs move beyond providing explicit hints and cues that enable interpretation and diagnosis in highly similar contexts and cases, to accelerating rule and strategy learning that enhances performance on highly dissimilar contexts and cases (Ball & Litchfield, 2017)? Second, it is worth pointing out that some research has suggested that people may intentionally alter their patterns of eye movements if they know that their eye movements are being monitored or that videos of their eye movements will be replayed to others (Neider, Chen, Dickinson, Brennan, & Zelinsky, 2010; Velichkovsky, 1995). While any such effects appear to be both rare and subtle, they do present a challenge to interpreting whether the effects of EMMEs are at least partially due to the intent of the <b>expert</b> <b>viewer</b> as opposed to being a natural representation of their viewing patterns in normal clinical practice (Ball & Litchfield, 2017).|$|E

METHODS: The cortical circumferential profiling (CCP) technique was used to extract information regarding patterns of cortical perfusion. Traditional analysis of the CCP data, taken from slices {{at the level of}} the basal ganglia, indicated significant perfusion deficits for Alzheimer's disease patients relative to normals, particularly in the left temporo-parietal and left posterior frontal areas of the cortex.

40|$|How {{are we to}} {{get beyond}} the {{literary}} metaphor Augst asserts is central problem with film analysis? How are we to step outside the "shot" as {{the unit of analysis}} - the "shot" which Bonitzer claims is useless for analysis because of researchers' "endlessly bifurcated" definitions of "shot? We have had success with a form of computational structural analysis which incorporates the viewer into the model. Comparing changes in levels of Red, Green, and Blue from frame to frame and comparing the patterns of change with an expert film theorist's model. We are currently analyzing discontinuities in the entire data stream of a film. We are asking just what aspects of the data stream account for viewer reactions. We are examining distribution of color, edges, luminance, and other components. By modeling changes in the various stimuli over time within a vector space model and comparing those changes with the responses of (at first) an <b>expert</b> <b>viewer,</b> then with a variety of viewers {{we should be able to}} make strides in matching forms of representation to the most effective mode of representation for the individual user; and at the same time provide a set of analytic tools that account for the multiple time-varying signals that make up a movie, whether a cell phone video or Hollywood blockbuster. Significantly, we now step outside the frame as the unit of analysis and look to the possibilities of analysis at the sub pixel level. That is, analysis of one component of a pixel location such as luminance or merely the green component (no red or blue provides a very fine grained level of examination. At the same time, the vector space model provides a way of examining the stimulus effect of multiple threads that do not necessarily change in synch. As we consider these possibilities, we begin to see a general model of a document as a continuous stream of data that either (as a whole or in part) functions as a stimulus or does not. Our poster will present graphical representations of changes in the data stream for the "Bodega Bay" sequence of Hichcock's THE BIRDS and the reactions of Raymond Bellour, whose analyses and modeling of Hichcok's works and of classic Hollywood film in general are held in high regard. We begin with Bellour and the Bodega Bay sequence because we have already published research on this data and, thus, have a significant foundation upon which to build. We will then apply the same techniques to a set of other works...|$|E

However, little research has tested these training guides. With the {{use of eye tracking}} technology and expert input we developed a digital training platform to be used in chest image interpretation learning.

Results: A digital training platform for use in chest image interpretation was created based on evidence within the literature, expert input and two search strategies previously used in clinical practice.

The platform is structured to allow the chest image interpretation process to be clear, concise and methodical. Conclusion: A search strategy was incorporated within the tool to investigate its use, with the possibility that it could be recommended as an evidence based approach for use by reporting clinicians. Eye tracking, a checklist and voice recordings have been combined to form a multi-dimensional learning tool, which has never been used in chest image interpretation learning before.

40|$|How does {{expertise}} {{in the analysis of}} particular images influence the effects of visual saliency upon attention? Expert analysts of aerial photographs and untrained viewers undertook change-detection and location memory tasks using aerial photographs with eye movements recorded throughout. Experts were more accurate in both tasks. Significant differences were also seen in the scanpaths: Untrained viewers fixated preferentially upon salient features throughout stimulus presentation whereas experts did not. However, both groups showed a strong influence of saliency in change detection and memory tasks. We interpret this apparent contradiction by: (i) assuming that the use of saliency in visual search is discretionary, and experts can use semantic information to prioritise where to fixate next; whereas, (ii) in tasks requiring spatial memory, analysis of visual saliency delivers easily acquired landmarks to reference the location of items in an image; a previously overlooked function used by <b>expert</b> and untrained <b>viewers</b> alike.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} why many products fail during their road to market and how companies can avoid the amount of time and money it supposes. The first part is a general approach to market failures, an analysis of the conditions or circumstances that cause the failure of a product in the market and the product development strategies used nowadays or marketing strategies to follow to make it a success. These strategies begin with the identification of a customer need. The end of the new product development process is the creation of the knowledge necessary to deliver a product which fulfills customer requirements. Products that do not fulfill consumer needs or wants will fail. To reduce the chance of failure there are many tools to help identify consumer attitudes and preferences.

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{multimedia}} website I {{have created}} for my Master's Thesis {{is a professional}} project, which covers numerous facets of the Armenian American presence in Los Angeles and does so through a multimedia storytelling format. The intention of the project, titled "L. A. = Little Armenia: The Story of the Armenian Diaspora in Los Angeles Today," is to give readers a more thorough understanding of the Armenian American experience through the reporting of past events, present struggles and future goals. I chose to specifically report on the Armenian Diaspora in Los Angeles, as {{it is home to}} the largest Armenian population in all of America, according to the 2000 U. S. Census. What experiences led Armenians to move to America, and specifically Los Angeles, to begin with? What are some local Armenian organizations working on now and how does it contribute to sustaining their Armenian identity? And how does the future look for the L. A. Armenian Diaspora in generations to come? All of these questions are answered throughout the structured layout of the website. In fact, the website has four fundamental sections through which the story is told.; The first section of the website, titled "Motivated Migration," covers the backstory of why Armenians migrated to places like Los Angeles to begin with. Through a visual and interactive timeline that I created with VUVOX, I outline each event in the Middle East that prompted migration elsewhere. Through a mixture of vivid pictures and descriptive captions, the VUVOX timeline illustrates to the viewer the positive correlation between these momentous incidents and the motivation to migrate. The timeline also shows, through statistics gathered from the 2000 U. S. Census, that with each of these events in the Middle East [...] be it a massacre, war or revolution [...] Armenian demographics in America rose.; Also laid out in this section are the specific Armenian “hubs” within Los Angeles County, where the Armenian population is most prevalent. Through the use of an interactive information graphic, the viewer is able to not only pinpoint the areas in Los Angeles where Armenians thrive but gain knowledge of the specific Armenian population within each city by hovering over the appropriate circled city with their mouse. This interactive map, which I created through the use of Dynamic HyperText Markup Language (DHTML), offers necessary statistics to the reader but does so through an alternative (and hopefully more engaging) multimedia method.; The second section of the website, titled "Historic Resentment," is a more indepth look into what instigated problems for Armenians in the Middle East to begin with. Though the VUVOX timeline in the previous section outlines the events that ultimately led to Armenian migration elsewhere, this section expands on those bullet-points of information and gets {{to the heart of the}} problem: why did these problems begin in the first place? And what group was at the core of the matter? By adding this historical context and getting a sense that a resentful relationship between Ottoman Turks and Armenians was at the center of the problem, the reader becomes not only more familiar with the history but also more understanding of how these historical experiences affect the Armenian culture today [...] especially with respect to the Armenian Diaspora.; This historical context is told through a "Question and Answer" format with Dr. Richard Dekmejian, a Middle Eastern politics expert and political science professor at USC. My intention for this type of format was to make the content more readable yet still place emphasis on substance. Void of the dreariness that huge blocks of text provoke, the Q&A is still filled with loads of essential information but broken up by simple questions that the reader might ask himself. Because this historical context is necessary to lay the foundation for the overall story of the Armenian Diaspora, an emphasis on content is essential. Each question is integral to the "Armenian story" as a whole [...] and spans from momentous events beginning in the 9 th century to current campaigns that the Diaspora is involved in today.; The third section of the website, titled "A Proactive Campaign," is a magnified look into one local Armenian American campaign that illustrates unity among much of the Armenian Diaspora in Los Angeles. The "Stop the Protocols" campaign started as a preemptive plan to prevent the Armenia-Turkey protocols, a document which would establish diplomatic ties between the two countries, from being signed. Though the protocols were eventually signed by both countries, marking a historic attempt from two age-old enemies to coexist, the campaign was successful in showing the strong push among many Armenian Americans in Los Angeles against this idea.; I chose to tell this story through a profile of one of the campaign’s major leaders, Caspar Jivalagian. Though I made sure to include other members of the Armenian Diaspora in the piece, I thought it important to keep the predominant voice on one person: a symbol for the campaign, Caspar. By following Caspar through rallies in which he spoke to getting more intimate, one-on-one interviews with him at home, I was able to get inside the thrust of the campaign through getting inside of Caspar’s mind. I feel this method of execution is most effective for the purposes of my thesis because the intent is to shine light on this one specific campaign, showcasing its core beliefs and how it relates to the bigger notion of Armenian identity. By getting such an intimate look inside of Caspar and his activism, you intrinsically become more familiar with the campaign he works so hard for every day.; The final section of my website, titled "The Future of the Cause," gives viewers a quick taste of the Armenian Diaspora as it stands now, as well as an idea of what's to come in the future. As Armenian Americans across Los Angeles are asked about their thoughts on a number of issues (Armenian identity, staying connected in the city, and the future of the Armenian Diaspora as they see it, etc), the section functions as a sort of open-ended conclusion to the entire piece. How attached to the Armenian culture do these Armenian Americans feel? Does living in Los Angeles make it easier or harder to stay connected? And do they think future generations will be just as connected? By covering a variety of questions like the ones above and through asking a variety of people in the Diaspora [...] be it active members of Armenian organizations, residents of highly populated Armenian cities or Armenian history <b>experts</b> [...] the <b>viewer</b> gets a more wellrounded sense of who makes up this Armenian Diaspora in L. A. and what these people think.; This compilation of thoughts is shown by way of video, which I believe to be the most effective platform for this coverage, as it allows for a more personal connection to form between the viewer and the people in the video. As viewers see and hear these Armenian Americans make their points, they feel as if they are getting to know them. Rather than a collection of facts, figures and information that was prevalent in other sections of the website, this final portion humanizes the central subject of my thesis: the Armenian Diaspora in L. A. It ends the project on a subjective and open-ended note.; Through the amalgamation of all of these separate components, the website tells a complete story of the Armenian Diaspora in Los Angeles from start to finish. It reports on the past experiences of Armenians and their motivation to migrate through coverage of their history, it highlights the current activity of certain members of the Diaspora through shining light on their broadly supported, Armenian American campaign and it offers a forecast of the future through the voice and thoughts of several Armenian Americans in the area.; The intention behind this project was to cover a subject that is often underrepresented in mainstream media and make it more accessible and understandable to people who are curious about the ethnicity. Rather than getting bits and pieces of this information elsewhere, the viewer can come to the "L. A. = Little Armenia" website and get the whole story – from why the Armenian Diaspora migrated to the city of Angels to what some are doing to remain active in its Armenian community. The variety of multimedia elements used throughout the website is intended to make the story easily understandable and more compelling than the standard text format.; But, above all, the multimedia project is a story of how the past can reinforce the present [...] and perhaps even the future. It highlights a Diaspora that is continually invested in maintaining its Armenian identity, partly due to their collective history and unique past experiences...|$|R
