40|$|The University of Exeter’s Arab World <b>Documentation</b> <b>Unit,</b> {{formerly}} known as the Gulf <b>Documentation</b> <b>Unit,</b> has undergone major changes {{in the course of the}} past two years. Its relocation to new premises, the broadened remit to cover all Arab countries, and the transfer of its management from the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies to the University Library all meant that the Unit’s unwritten mission and goals, as well as its organisational structure, needed to be re-evaluated and reformulated. This study seeks to provide a framework for the formulation of a written collection management policy and a mission statement for AWDU, in order to define a consistent practise for future systematic maintenance and management of the collection. This is achieved by examining the Unit’s collections, services and facilities through selected elements of the collection management policy. A user-centred evaluation of the AWDU collections and services is conducted through a survey of two major user groups, the faculty and students of IAIS. 57 % of the faculty and 21 % of the students responded to the questionnaires. In order to understand the role of the <b>Documentation</b> <b>Unit</b> on the local and national levels, its history and development are documented, and the motives and reasons behind its establishment are examined in the context of Arabic and Middle Eastern studies in the UK...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Reference {{documentation}} is {{an important}} source of information on API usage. However, information useful to programmers can be buried in irrelevant text, or attached to a non-intuitive API element, making it difficult to discover. We propose to detect and recommend fragments of API documentation potentially important to a programmer who has already decided to use a certain API element. We categorize text fragments in API doc-umentation based on whether they contain information that is indispensable, valuable, or neither. From the fragments that contain knowledge worthy of recommendation, we extract word patterns, and use these patterns to automatically find new fragments that contain simi-lar knowledge in unseen documentation. We implemented our technique in a tool, Krec, that supports both information filtering and discovery. In an evaluation study with randomly-sampled method definitions from ten open source systems, we found that with a training set derived from about 1000 <b>documentation</b> <b>units,</b> we could issue recommendations with about 90 % precision and 69 % recall. In a study involving ten independent assessors, indispens-able knowledge items recommended for API types were judged useful 57 % of the time and potentially useful an additional 30 % of the time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Reading {{reference}} documentation is {{an important}} part of programming with APIs. Reference documentation complements the API by providing information not obvious from the syntax of the API. To improve the quality of reference documentation and the efficiency with which the relevant information it contains can be accessed, we must first understand its content. We report on a study of the nature and organization of knowledge contained in the reference documentation of the hundreds of APIs provided as part of two major technology platforms: Java SDK 6 and. NET 4. 0. Our study involved the development of a taxonomy of knowledge types based on grounded methods and independent empirical validation. Seventeen trained coders used the taxonomy to rate a total of 5574 randomly-sampled <b>documentation</b> <b>units</b> to assess the knowledge they contain. Our results provide a comprehensive perspective on the patterns of knowledge in API documentation: observations about the types of knowledge it contains, and how this knowledge is distributed throughout the documentation. The taxonomy and patterns of knowledge we present in this paper can be used to help practitioners evaluate the content of their API documentation, better organize their documentation, and limit the amount of low-value content. They also provides a vocabulary that can help structure and facilitate discussions about the content of APIs. F...|$|R
