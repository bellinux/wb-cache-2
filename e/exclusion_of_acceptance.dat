However, it is not known if long-term <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> livestock grazing has positive effect on above-and belowground community properties in typical steppe of the Loess Plateau. We studied the long-term (20 -year) cumulative effects <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> livestock grazing on above-and belowground community properties compared with that before <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> livestock grazing in a typical steppe of the Loess Plateau, NW China. Our results show that twenty-year <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> livestock grazing significantly increased above-and belowground biomass, species richness, cover and height for five different communities. Most of belowground biomass was in the 0 - 20 cm horizon and grazing exclusion increased biomass especially at the depth of 0 - 10 cm.

40|$|The {{design of}} the {{training}} stage of a supervised classification should account for {{the properties of the}} classifier to be used. Consideration of the way the classifier operates may enable the training stage to be designed in a manner which ensures that the aim of the classification is satisfied {{with the use of a}} small, inexpensive, training set. It may, therefore, be possible to reduce the training set size requirements from that generally expected with the use of standard heuristics. Substantial reductions in training set size may be possible if interest is focused on a single class. This is illustrated for mapping cotton in north-western India by support vector machine type classifiers. Four approaches to reducing training set size were used: intelligent selection of the most informative training samples, selective class <b>exclusion,</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> imprecise descriptions for spectrally distinct classes and the adoption of a one-class classifier. All four approaches were able to reduce the training set size required considerably below that suggested by conventional widely used heuristics without significant impact on the accuracy with which the class of interest was classified. For example, reductions in training set size of ? 90 % from that suggested by a conventional heuristic are reported with the accuracy of cotton classification remaining nearly constant at ? 95 % and ? 97 % from the user's and producer's perspectives respectivel...|$|R
40|$|The hukou {{system has}} long been {{regarded}} as the root cause <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> rural-urban migrants in China, so the abolition of this system is considered {{the best way to}} bridge the rural-urban division.

This article suggests taking a 'beyond hukou' perspective to re-examine the social <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> rural-urban migrants in urban China. 14 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Background: Research on the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> {{cosmetic}} surgery {{has focused on}} relatively affluent Western samples, to the <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> non-Western samples and any potential cross-cultural differences. While rates of {{cosmetic surgery}} in South Korea have risen sharply in the past decade, mirroring rates in other East Asian nations, {{little is known about}} attitudes toward cosmetic surgery in the Korean population. Objectives: To examine the factor structure and correlates of a Korean adaptation <b>of</b> the previously-published <b>Acceptance</b> <b>of</b> Cosmetic Surgery Scale (ACSS). Methods: South Korean university students (N = 267) completed the ACSS, as well as included Korean translations of measures for actual vs. ideal body weight discrepancy, body appreciation, sociocultural attitudes toward appearance, and demographics. Results: The Korean ACSS reduced to a two-factor solution, mirroring results among other non-Western samples, although a one-factor solution was deemed more plausible. Compared to men, women had significantly higher total scores, suggesting that they were more accepting of cosmetic surgery. A multiple regression showed that, after controlling for the effects of participant sex, the only significant predictor <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> cosmetic surgery was general body appreciation, suggesting that some may view cosmetic surgery as a means of enhancing their body image. Conclusions: The results reveal important global information for plastic surgeons-not only on the treatment of non-Western patients but on the South Korean market, in which the cosmetic surgery industry remains unregulated. Given the popularity and <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> cosmetic surgery in South Korea, there is an urgent need for regulatory intervention to ensure patient safety and satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|Recognition of {{the value}} <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the self, others, and the flux of human experience, has {{philosophical}} and religious roots that date back thousands of years. The past two decades have witnessed a swell <b>of</b> interest in <b>acceptance,</b> as evidenced {{by an increase in}} acceptance-based therapeutic interventions, and a growing appreciation of the paradoxical nature <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> and personal change and the role of experiential avoidance in psychopathology. In this article we review historical and contemporary descriptions and definitions <b>of</b> <b>acceptance,</b> measures <b>of</b> <b>acceptance,</b> the relation between acceptance and change, and the role <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> in psychopathology and psychotherapy. Our central objective is to delineate a rich conceptual scheme that encompasses the diverse ways in which acceptance has been explicated in classical and contemporary writings, and to highlight the need for further validation of this useful and popular construct. The notion that acceptance—of oneself, other people, circumstances, and the world at large—can be a force for personal change has deep roots in Eastern and Western culture.

Conversely, {{reduction of the}} donor pool by <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> donors with positive smoking histories could compromise survival of patients waiting to receive a transplant. We examined the consequences of donor smoking on post-transplantation survival, and the potential effect of not transplanting lungs from such donors. Methods - We analysed the effect of donor smoking on 3 year survival after first adult lung transplantation from brain-dead donors done between July 1, 1999, and Dec 31, 2010, by Cox regression modelling of data from the UK Transplant Registry. We estimated the effect <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> lungs from donors with positive smoking histories on survival and compared it with the effect of remaining {{on the waiting list}} for a potential transplant from a donor with a negative smoking history donor, by analysing all waiting-list registrations during the same period with a risk-adjusted sequentially stratified Cox regression model.

40|$|Ethnophaulisms (A. A. Roback, 1944) are {{the words}} used as ethnic slurs to refer to out-groups in hate speech. The results of {{previous}} archival research have suggested {{that it is the}} complexity, more so than the valence, of ethnophaulisms that predicts the <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> ethnic immigrant out-groups from the receiving society.
