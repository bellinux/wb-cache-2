While the Defense Reorganization Act of 1958 aimed to correct these deficiencies, the intelligence responsibilities remained unclear, the coordination was poor and the results fell short of national reliability and focus. As a result of this poor organization, President Dwight D.

The bilateral trade value between India and China in the year 2010 was 60 billion USD and the trade target for the year 2015 is set as 100 billion USD. Despite the enormous amount of trade and business activities happening between both these countries, there have been {{quite a lot of}} issues that hinders the trade between them and the companies from India and China face a lot of challenges in interacting with each others.

This report also analyses about the logistics issues faced by companies and the barriers these companies face in entering each other markets.
