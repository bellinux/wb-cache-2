40|$|The {{research}} defines derivatives {{as private}} contracts, with future {{rights and obligations}} imposed on all parties, used to hedge or transfer risk, which derives value from an underlying asset price or index, which asset price or index may take on various forms. The nature of derivatives is that the instruments are intended to be risk management tools. The objectives of derivatives is either to <b>hedge</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk,</b> or to speculate. Derivatives may be classified by {{the manner in which}} they are traded, either over the counter (OTC) or on exchange. Alternatively, derivatives may be classified on the basis of structure and mechanisms, i. e. forwards, futures, options or swaps. Risk and risk management are defined in the third chapter with the focus on merchant banking. The nature of risk is that it is inherent in all activities. The nature of risk management is that it aims to ensure that the risks faced by the merchant bank are managed on a daily basis. The objective of risk management is to ensure that losses are minimised and the appropriate level of risk is taken in order to maximise profits. Risk may be classified as operational, operations, market, systemic, credit and legal risk. A comprehensive discussion of credit risk is presented, as it pertains to the legal risk in derivatives in a merchant bank. This includes insolvency, set-off, netting, credit derivatives and collateral. Legal risk is defined as the risk of loss primarily caused by legal unenforceability (i. e. a defective transaction, for instance a contract), legal liability (i. e. a claim) or failure to take legal steps to protect assets (e. g. intellectual property). The nature of legal risk is that it is caused by jurisdictional and other cross-border factors, inadequate documentation, the behaviour of financial institutions, a lack of internal controls, financial innovation or the inherent uncertainty of the law. The objectives of legal risk management in derivatives is to avoid the direct and indirect costs associated with legal risk materialising. This includes reputational damage. Derivatives attract specific legal risks due to the complexity of the instruments as well as the constant innovation in the market. There remains some legal uncertainty regarding derivatives in terms of gaming, wagering and gambling, as well as insurance. The relationship between risk and derivatives is that due to the complexity and constant innovation associated with derivatives, there are some inherent risks to trading in derivatives. It is therefore important to ensure that there is a vested risk management culture in the derivatives trading environment. Chapter four gives an overview of derivatives legislation in foreign jurisdictions and in South Africa. The contractual and documentation issues are discussed with reference to ad hoc agreements, master agreements and ISDA agreements. The practical implementation issues of master agreements and ad hoc agreements are also discussed. The recommendations are that legal risk management be approached in a similar manner to credit, market and other risk disciplines. A legal risk management policy needs to be developed and implemented. The second recommendation is that a derivative to manage the legal risk in derivatives be developed. Prof. P. Sutherland Dr. C. van der Bij...|$|E

40|$|Derivatives are {{commonly}} defined as some {{variation of the}} following: financial instruments whose value {{is derived from the}} performance of a secondary source such as an underlying bond, commodity, or index. This definition is both over-inclusive and under-inclusive. Thus, not surprisingly, even many policy makers, regulators, and legal analysts misunderstand them. It is important for interested parties such as policy makers to understand derivatives because the types and uses of derivatives have exploded in the last few decades and because these financial instruments can provide both social benefits and cause social harms. This Article presents a framework for understanding modern derivatives by identifying the characteristicst hat all derivatives share. All derivatives are contracts between two counterparties in which the payoffs to and from each counterparty depend on the outcome of one or more extrinsic, future, uncertain event or metric and in which each counterparty expects (or takes) such outcome to be opposite to that expected (or taken) by the other counterparty. The framework presented in this Article will facilitate the development of more rational and comprehensive derivatives regulations, including (i) those required under the recently enacted Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the 2 ̆ 2 Dodd-Frank Act 2 ̆ 7) and (ii) those addressing the particular risks associated with 2 ̆ 2 purely speculative derivatives 2 ̆ 2 (those in which neither party is <b>hedging</b> <b>a</b> pre-existing <b>risk)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|An {{operational}} space map is an efficient tool to compare {{a large number}} of operational strategies to find an optimal choice of setpoints based on a multicriterion. Typically, such a multicriterion includes a weighted sum of cost of operation and effluent quality. Due to the relative high cost of aeration such a definition of optimality result in a relatively high fraction of the effluent total nitrogen in the form of ammonium. Such a strategy may however introduce <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> into operation because a low degree of ammonium removal leads to a low amount of nitrifiers. This in turn leads to a reduced ability to reject event disturbances, such as large variations in the ammonium load, drop in temperature, the presence of toxic/inhibitory compounds in the influent etc. <b>Hedging</b> is <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> minimisation tool, with the aim to "reduce one 2 ̆ 7 s risk of loss on a bet or speculation by compensating transactions on the other side" (The Concise Oxford Dictionary (1995)). In wastewater treatment plant operation hedging can be applied by choosing a higher level of ammonium removal {{to increase the amount of}} nitrifiers. This is a sensible way to introduce disturbance rejection ability into the multi criterion. In practice, this is done by deciding upon an internal effluent ammonium criterion. In some countries such as Germany, a separate criterion already applies to the level of ammonium in the effluent. However, in most countries the effluent criterion applies to total nitrogen only. In these cases, an internal effluent ammonium criterion should be selected in order to secure proper disturbance rejection ability...|$|R

Even though many diffusion models including generic 1 -dimensional ones satisfy the required condition, a construction of the iterated static hedge that is applicable to any uniformly elliptic diffusions is postponed to the present paper because of its mathematical difficulty. We solve the problem in this paper by relying on the symmetrization, a technique first introduced in Imamura-Ishigaki-Okumura (2014) and generalized in Akahori-Imamura (2014), and also work on parametrix, a classical technique from perturbation theory to construct a fundamental solution of a partial differential equation.

40|$|According to {{conventional}} wisdom, long-term bonds {{are appropriate for}} long-term investors who value stability of income. We develop a model of optimal consumption and portfolio choice for infinitely-lived investors facing stochastic interest rates, solve it using an approximate analytical method, and evaluate the conventional wisdom. We show that the demand for long-term bonds has both a myopic component and <b>an</b> intertemporal <b>hedging</b> component. <b>As</b> <b>risk</b> aversion increases, the myopic component shrinks to zero but the hedging component does not. An infinitely risk-averse investor who is infinitely unwilling to substitute consumption intertemporally should hold a portfolio of long-term indexed bonds that is equivalent to an indexed perpetuity. This portfolio finances a riskless consumption stream and in this sense provides a stable income. We calibrate our model to postwar US data and compare consumption and portfolio rules with and without bond indexation, portfolio constraints, {{and the possibility of}} investment in equities. We find that when indexed bonds are not available, inflation risk leads investors to shorten their bond portfolios and increase their precautionary savings. This has serious welfare costs for conservative investors, who are much better off when they have the opportunity to buy indexed bonds. We also find that the ratio of bonds to equities in the optimal portfolio increases with the coefficient of relative risk aversion, which is consistent with conventional portfolio advice but inconsistent with the mutual fund theorem of static portfolio analysis. Our results illustrate the general point that static portfolio choice models should not be used to study the dynamic problems facing long-term investors. ...|$|R

The first step of the model we advance focuses on scenario correlation between business performances and rain. The second step consists of the proposal of a financial instrument able to hedge rainfall risk, i. e. to mitigate the negative impacts of rain on the business performances of hospitality firms. The proposed model borrows its foundations from the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), one of the most worldwide well-known reference models for risk management. The model is supported by a numerical application based on the main profitability ratios of 25 hotels located on Lake Garda (the largest Italian lake and one of the main tourist attractions on an international scale, above all in the summer period) in the decade 2005 - 2014 and on the amounts of rain fell on that lake in that decade.
