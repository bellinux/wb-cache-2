The paints were composed of a polyurethane resin binder in which various pigments were incorporated {{in such a way}} that they formed stable paint dispersions, satisfying stability criteria for façade coatings. A low emittance of the paints was achieved by using low-emittance aluminium flake pigments combined with <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (<b>red</b> coloured paints). Black pigment was added to adjust solar absorptance. Blue and green paints were made by the addition of coloured aluminium flake pigment and the solar absorptance was also adjusted by the addition of black pigment. Efficiency for photo-thermal conversion of solar radiation was assessed by evaluation of the corresponding performance criteria, which enabled the selection of paints whose performance criteria values were higher than 0 (spectrally non-selective black coating). The results confirmed that blue and green paints and to minor extent red ones, combined selectivity with colour.

30|$|Bauer’s {{painting}} style changed markedly {{during and}} after his expedition to Australia with Matthew Flinders (1801 – 1806), and he favoured a more delicate watercolour style in transparent watercolour [1, 6, 38]. After 1800, Bauer largely abandoned the opaque painting technique he had used for the Flora Graeca paintings. Having more time to paint these at his leisure in Australia and after he returned to England in 1806, {{it is likely that}} he was able to spend more time on the more technically complex transparent watercolour technique. To do so also required a change to his pigment palette. Opaque pigments used in the Flora Graeca paintings such as lead white, red lead and vermillion were perhaps more suited to the bodycolour painting traditionally used in both manuscript illumination and portrait miniature painting [22, 26, 38]. XRF analysis carried out at the Natural History Museum in 2016 revealed that, at least in the small sample of paintings analysed, lead, copper and mercury were absent from Bauer’s palette during these years. Pigments in the later paintings contained iron, aluminium, sulphur, potassium and barium, suggesting that he abandoned the use of the opaque copper greens and blues, vermillion, red lead and lead white used throughout the Flora Graeca in favour of more transparent laked pigments. As noted above, ultramarine, indigo and an unknown, transparent blue were found in several instances, but no red pigment used in these paintings produced a Raman spectrum. Furthermore, levels of iron in these pigments were only slightly higher than the paper background, largely ruling out the <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>reds,</b> and suggesting Bauer's preference for organic red lakes at this time.|$|R
30|$|The prints {{analyzed}} {{in this study}} can be split into two subsets: those that use natural orpiment as a yellow pigment (Set A) and those that use artificial arsenic sulfide (Set B). The prints with brighter green and yellow tones in Set A used natural orpiment in the yellow and green areas of the print. The yellow pigment found in these prints exhibited the characteristic Raman spectrum of orpiment (Fig.  1), and SEM images showed flat plate-like particles between 1 and 30  μm in size, also typical of natural orpiment. In contrast, the prints with relatively duller yellow and green tones in Set B were found to use artificial arsenic sulfide, {{as indicated by the}} homogeneous 1 – 3  μm diameter spherical pigment particles, the broader Raman peaks, and the excess in sulfur detected by SEM–EDS. The Raman and SEM–EDS data of the artificial arsenic sulfide identified in the prints agrees well with previous reports of dry-process artificial orpiment [1, 2, 8, 18]. A notable exception to the distinctive use of natural orpiment in Set A and artificial arsenic sulfide in Set B was print JP 1082 (Set B). In this print, in addition to artificial arsenic sulfide in the yellow and green areas, we found natural orpiment, limited to the orange areas of the print and mixed with <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>red</b> (as identified by XRF and Raman). Thus, natural orpiment was mixed with a red pigment with the intent of obtaining a bright orange tone. This finding implies that natural orpiment was available alongside the artificial sulfide at the time the prints in Set B were published.|$|R
30|$|Esters, ketones and ether esters are {{suitable}} solvents for clear and pigmented PU coating systems.

Organic pigments frequently found in the PU paint formulations, include quinocridone and perylene reds, monoazo and isoindoline yellows, and phthalocyanine blues and greens. The use of organic pigments from other classes may involve undesirable effects on the curing process of PU paint films [10]. Commercial PU coatings contain various additives, such as catalysts, flattening, leveling, thickening and anti-foaming agents. The presence of catalysts offers advantageous rates of polyurethanes reaction at lower temperatures. Those used in PU industry essentially consist on tertiary amines and tin complexes compounds [9].|$|R
40|$|New geopolymer {{formulations}} {{were designed}} by sodium silicate/NaOH activation of metakaolin, <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> and <b>red</b> mud mixtures. The effects of source materials on the microstructure and mechanical properties were studied. Each formulation induces different degree of geopolymerization reaction as reflected by the phase composition where the amorphous phase is predominant. These vestiges are related to silica provided by sodium silicate more reactive in the geopolymerization than the silica of metakaolin. Moreover, the variation in strength between the geopolymers is attributed to the same factors, with higher porosity and nonreacted phases found in the red mud based geopolymer matrix. In function of curing time, the mechanical strength increased from day 1 to 28 for the samples with a low amount of red mud. In these two cases, longer curing time improves the geopolymerization state resulting in higher compressive load. The metakaolin and metakaolin/red mud products exhibited comparable water absorption and density. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{treatments}} of the Inca Empire {{have sought to}} document its deep economic and political impact on local populations in the Andes. There has been less study of how subject groups might have independently negotiated opportunistic economic responses to the Inca Empire. This research explores this issue through {{the investigation of the}} relationship between the Inca Road and a recently discovered, non-Inca system of mining camps, isolated deep in the Atacama Desert, northern Chile. Study of the development of these camps, and of their relationship with the Road aimed at addressing whether the Atacama Inca Road, served as a linear exchange nexus, or only as a highway servicing Inca imperial needs. To address this objective, I conducted a one-year project of survey, surface collection, and excavation to investigate: (1) the social organization and chaîne opératoire of turquoise and malachite beads, and red pigment production at the Cachiyuyo de Llampos Mountain camps; and (2) the nature of settlement and associated artifact assemblages along a nearby section of the Inca Road. In contrast to Inca state-ruled mining sites from the Inca epoch, these Chilean camps lacked Inca architecture and production patterns, presenting instead a pattern of artisan household mining and craft production of copper ore beads, <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>red</b> pigment, and the crafting of items with distantly acquired raw materials. This craft production predated the Inca, and was not greatly altered following Inca conquest. However, occupation and production did intensify following Inca conquest, as the Road became a logistical resource for the camps, facilitating provisioning and exchange. Local miners and artisans worked full time in the desert, far from agricultural areas; the Inca Road became their main connection for the acquisition and movement of goods, independent of the Inca Empire’s imperial purposes. The data generated on domestic and craft activities, and on local and long distance exchange, contributes to our understanding of the use of the Inca Road and to how populations respond to imperial infrastructure. ...|$|R

30|$|<b>Iron</b> <b>oxide</b> is {{the main}} {{component}} of the red pigment used for the background drapery. It is evidenced by elevated Fe counts on spots within the contours of drapery (Fig.  7 c). Generally, XRF analysis permits the distinction between pure <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (hematite) and <b>red</b> ochre by the detection of Si, Al, Ti and Mn lines in XRF spectra of the latter. However, {{in the case of the}} hidden painting, the detection of low-Z elements was not possible because of the attenuation of the signal by the upper painting and the varnish layer(s). As for Mn, its omnipresence in XRF spectra is likely due to the upper painting, which appears dark brown in the majority of the analysed spots. These limitations of XRF elemental analysis allow the identification of only general types of red pigments based on <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> in the case of hidden paintings, whereas a more precise assignment as hematite or red ochre would be possible on the analysis of painting cross-sections. Depending on the analysed spot, the XRF spectra from the drapery spots are featured by low intensity Hg and As lines, suggesting admixtures of vermilion and orpiment, respectively. The identification of orpiment is also supported by the detection of shiny yellow crystals on the highlighted drapery folds by digital microscopy. Along with orpiment, lead white was likely used for the highlighted drapery folds and the light shade of the diagonal line visible to the right from man’s figure.|$|R

The Persian palette was divided into six primary colors, white, yellow, red, green, blue, black, and six metal-based pigments, gold, silver, brass, copper, tin, mica [5 – 7]. Of these, the inorganic materials can be separated into naturally occurring minerals—orpiment (arsenic sulfide) for yellow, cinnabar (mercuric sulfide), realgar (arsenic sulfide), and various ochres (<b>iron</b> <b>oxides)</b> for <b>red,</b> and lapis lazuli (ultramarine) for blue—and synthetic compounds—lead white (basic lead carbonate) for white, red lead (lead tetroxide) and vermilion/cinnabar (mercuric sulfide) for red, and verdigris (copper acetate) for green. Several organic materials were also used as pigments and include those derived from plants such as rhubarb and saffron for yellow, safflower and brazil wood for red, and indigo for blue, and those produced from insects such as kermes, cochineal and lac for red. Many of the recipes mentioned mixing the pigments with gums for preparation or use. One 16 th century Iranian paint box contained lead white, red lead, an organic red, yellow orpiment, organic yellow pigments derived from rhubarb and saffron, copper-based green, ultramarine, indigo and red and brown earth pigments [5, 7].|$|R
