40|$|Development of {{the patch}} clamp {{technique}} by the Nobel Prize winners Bert Sakmann and Erwin Neher led to huge advances in ion channel research. Their work laid the foundations and revolutionized electrophysiological studies of cells and ion channels. These ion channels underlie many basic cellular physiological processes and, therefore, are key therapeutic targets for pharmaceutical companies. However, current pharmacological strategies are {{hampered by the}} lack of specific ion channel blockers. Intense research and development programs are now actively employing antibodies to target ion channels in various formats. This review discusses the use of ion channel antibodies and their associated small molecules as pharmacological tools, termed <b>immunopharmacology.</b> In addition, we will review some recent studies looking into clinical applications of <b>immunopharmacology</b> and intrabodies...|$|E
40|$|Most {{therapeutic}} monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) licensed {{for human}} use or in clinical development are indicated {{for treatment of}} patients with cancer and inflammatory/autoimmune disease and as such, are designed to directly interact with the immune system. A major hurdle for the development and early clinical investigation {{of many of these}} immunomodulatory mAbs is their inherent risk for adverse immune-mediated drug reactions in humans such as infusion reactions, cytokine storms, immunosuppression and autoimmunity. A thorough understanding of the <b>immunopharmacology</b> of a mAb in humans and animals is required to both anticipate the clinical risk of adverse immunotoxicological events and to select a safe starting dose for first-in-human (FIH) clinical studies. This review summarizes the most common adverse immunotoxicological events occurring in humans with immunomodulatory mAbs and outlines non-clinical strategies to define their <b>immunopharmacology</b> and assess their immunotoxic potential, as well as reduce the risk of immunotoxicity through rational mAb design. Tests to assess the relative risk of mAb candidates for cytokine release syndrome, innate immune system (dendritic cell) activation and immunogenicity in humans are also described. The importance of selecting a relevant and sensitive toxicity species for human safety assessment in which the <b>immunopharmacology</b> of the mAb is similar to that expected in humans is highlighted, as is the importance of understanding the limitations of the species selected for human safety assessment and supplementation of in vivo safety assessment with appropriate in vitro human assays. A tiered approach to assess effects on immune status, immune function and risk of infection and cancer, governed by the mechanism of action and structural features of the mAb, is described. Finally, the use of <b>immunopharmacology</b> and immunotoxicity data in determining a minimum anticipated biologic effect Level (MABEL) and in the selection of safe human starting dose is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Drugs {{targeting}} {{the immune system}} such as corticosteroids, antihistamines and immunosuppressants have been widely exploited {{in the treatment of}} inflammatory, allergic and autoimmune disorders {{during the second half of}} the 20 th century. The recent advances in immunopharmacological research have made available new classes of clinically relevant drugs. These comprise protein kinase inhibitors and biologics, such as monoclonal antibodies, that selectively modulate the immune response not only in cancer and autoimmunity but also in a number of other human pathologies. Likewise, more effective vaccines utilizing novel antigens and adjuvants are valuable tools for the prevention of transmissible infectious diseases and for allergen-specific immunotherapy. Consequently, <b>immunopharmacology</b> is presently considered as one of the expanding fields of pharmacology. <b>Immunopharmacology</b> addresses the selective regulation of immune responses and aims to uncover and exploit beneficial therapeutic options for typical and non-typical immune system-driven unmet clinical needs. While in the near future a number of new agents will be introduced, improving the effectiveness and safety of those currently in use is imperative for all researchers and clinicians working in the fields of immunology, pharmacology and drug discovery.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{explored}} {{the effects of}} immunotherapy, alone or in combination with conventional therapies, on both experimental and human cancers. Evidence has been provided that combined treatments with thymosin alpha 1 (T alpha 1) and low doses of interferon (IFN) or interleukin (IL) - 2 are highly effective in restoring several immune responses depressed by tumor growth and/or cytostatic drugs. In addition, when combined with specific chemotherapy, {{they are able to}} increase the anti-tumor effect of chemotherapy while markedly reducing the general toxicity of the treatment. The advantages of using this combined chemo-immunotherapeutic approach in experimental and human cancers are reviewed in this issue.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this paper focuses on the {{secondary}} immunodeficiencies caused by immunosuppressive drugs and environmental chemicals. The mechanism of action and the therapeutic effects of azathioprine, glucocorticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin A, and anticancer drugs will be discussed. The im-munotoxic actions of benzene, polychlorinated and polybrominated biphenyls, tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, various insecticides, metals and abused drugs or drugs with side effects are also described. Immunorestorative approaches are discussed in the second part, based on our current knowledge of the immune system and the lymphokines and hormones involved in its function. The usefulness of thymic hormones, interleukin 2, macrophage growth factorkolony stimulating factor, and interferons as immunotherapeutic agents is considered.

40|$|Quercetin (Q), a {{bioflavonoid}} ubiquitously {{distributed in}} vegetables, fruits, leaves, and grains, can be absorbed, transported, and excreted after oral intake. However, {{little is known}} about Q uptake and metabolism by macrophages. To clarify the puzzle, Q at its noncytotoxic concentration (44 μM) was incubated without or with mouse peritoneal macrophages for different time periods. Medium alone, extracellular, and intracellular fluids of macrophages were collected to detect changes in Q and its possible metabolites using high-performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that Q was unstable and easily oxidized in either the absence or the presence of macrophages. The remaining Q and its metabolites, including isorhamnetin and an unknown Q metabolite [possibly Q– (O-semiquinone) ], might be absorbed by macrophages. The percentage of maximal Q uptake by macrophages was found to be 2. 28 % immediately after incubation; however, Q uptake might persist for about 24 hours. Q uptake by macrophages was greater than the uptake of its methylated derivative isorhamnetin. As Q or its metabolites entered macrophages, those compounds were metabolized primarily into isorhamnetin, kaempferol, or unknown endogenous Q metabolites.

40|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are {{the most}} potent of antigen-presenting cells. The most {{important}} function of DC is to initiate the immune response by presenting antigens to naïve T lymphocytes. Currently, {{little is known about}} the basic action of lycopene in murine bone marrow (BM) -derived DC. In the present study, we have revealed that lycopene significantly attenuates the phenotypic and functional maturation of murine BM-DC, especially in lipopolysaccharide-induced DC maturation. We found that lycopene down-regulates the expression of costimulatory molecules (CD 80 and CD 86) and major histocompatibility complex type II molecules. We also determined that lycopene-treated DC were poor stimulators of naïve allogeneic T-cell proliferation and induced lower levels of interleukin- 2 in responding T cells. They also exhibited impaired interleukin- 12 production. Additionally, lycopene was able to inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinases, such as ERK 1 / 2, p 38 and JNK, and the transcription factor, nuclear factor-κB. Assessment of the in vivo effects of lycopene may reveal an inability to induce a normal cell-mediated immune response, despite the ability of the cells to migrate to the spleen.

40|$|The skin {{irritant}} polyyne falcarinol (panaxynol, carotatoxin) {{is found in}} carrots, parsley, celery, and in the medicinal plant Panax ginseng. In our ongoing search for new cannabinoid (CB) receptor ligands we have isolated falcarinol from the endemic Sardinian plant Seseli praecox. We show that falcarinol exhibits binding affinity to both human CB receptors but selectively alkylates the anandamide binding site in the CB 1 receptor (Ki = 594 nM), acting as covalent inverse agonist in CB 1 receptor-transfected CHO cells. Given the inherent instability of purified falcarinol we repeatedly isolated this compound for biological characterization and one new polyyne was characterized. In human HaCaT keratinocytes falcarinol increased {{the expression of the}} pro-allergic chemokines IL- 8 and CCL 2 /MCP- 1 in a CB 1 receptor-dependent manner.

40|$|Homeopathy {{was born}} as an {{experimental}} discipline, {{as can be}} seen from the enormous amount of homeopathic data collected over more than two centuries. However, the medical tradition of homeopathy has been separated from that of conventional science for a long time. Conventional scientific wisdom dictates that homeopathy should have no effect above placebo but experiments on ultra-high dilutions of solutes together with some clinical data suggest the intriguing possibility that it might do in some circumstances. Today, an osmotic process between disciplines, previously seen as in conflict, is facilitated because over the last few decades homeopathy has initiated the methods of current medical science and a substantial number of experimental studies—at molecular, cellular and clinical levels—are available. One area of dialogue and of common progress is that of inflammation and immunity, probably because these are closely related to the traditional ‘vital force ’ of the body’s self-healing power.

40|$|In our {{previous}} studies, {{we showed that}} angelan, a polysaccharide purified from Angelica gigas Nakai, is a potent LPS-mimetic in murine macrophages [Jeon, Y. J., Han, S. B., Ahn, K. S., Kim, H. M., 1999. Activation of NF-κB/Rel in angelan-stimulated macrophages. <b>Immunopharmacology</b> 43, 1 - 9]. Angelan stimulates murine macrophage to produce cytokines including iNOS and activate NF-κB/Rel. In the present study, we investigated the role of CD 14 and complement receptor type 3 (CR 3) in mediating NO production and NF- κB/Rel activation induced by angelan and LPS. Three major differences between angelan and LPS were observed. First, angelan does not require serum proteins for NO response and NF-κB/Rel activation, while the activation by LPS requires serum proteins. Second, blocking of either CD 14 or CR 3 decreased angelan-induced NO response, while LPS-mediated NO production was inhibited by anti-CD 14 mAb only. Third, angelan induced strong NF-κB/Rel and slight AP- 1 DNA binding, whereas LPS potently activated both NF-κB/Rel and AP- 1. Both angelan and LPS degraded IκB proteins and subsequently induced the mobilization of NF-κB/Rel proteins (p 65, c-rel and p 50) into nucleus. This suggests that macrophages display a common signaling machinery leading to the NF-κB/Rel activation in response to different stimulants. In conclusion, angelan and LPS use the membrane receptor CD 14 and CR 3 differentially for signaling NF-κB/Rel activation and NO production. ope...|$|E
