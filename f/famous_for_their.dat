5|$|A {{long period}} of uplift and erosion was {{concurrent}} with and followed the above events, creating a major unconformity. Sediments worn off the Death Valley region were shed both east and west and carried by wind and water; the eastern sediments ended up in Colorado and are now <b>famous</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> dinosaur fossils. No Jurassic to Eocene sedimentary formations exist in the area except for some possibly Jurassic-age volcanic rock around Butte Valley. Large parts of previously deposited formations were removed; probably by streams that washed the sediment into the Cretaceous Seaway that longitudinally divided North America to the east.|$|E

5|$|Planarians, a {{subgroup}} of seriates, are <b>famous</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> ability to regenerate if divided by cuts across their bodies. Experiments show that, in fragments {{that do not}} already have a head, a new head grows most quickly on those closest to the original head. This suggests {{the growth of a}} head is controlled by a chemical whose concentration diminishes from head to tail. Many turbellarians clone themselves by transverse or longitudinal division, and others, especially acoels, reproduce by budding.|$|E
5|$|The Muisca were <b>famous</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> goldworking. Although in the Muisca Confederation gold {{deposits}} {{were not}} abundant, the people obtained {{a lot of}} gold through trading, mainly in La Tora (called Barrancabermeja today) and other locations at the Magdalena River. The earliest radiocarbon dates of goldworking of the Muisca are derived from carbon traces in the cores of golden noserings and provided ages of between 600 and 800 AD. The oldest evidences for Muisca goldworking were found in Guatavita, Fusagasugá and El Peñon, all in present-day Cundinamarca. The goldwork bears similarity but is not identical to the metallurgy of the Quimbaya of the Cauca and Magdalena Valleys.|$|E
5|$|Though territorially a small kingdom, the Western Ganga {{contribution}} to polity, culture and {{literature of the}} modern south Karnataka region is considered important. The Western Ganga kings showed benevolent tolerance to all faiths but are most <b>famous</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> patronage toward Jainism resulting {{in the construction of}} monuments in places such as Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli. The kings of this dynasty encouraged the fine arts due to which literature in Kannada and Sanskrit flourished. Chavundaraya's writing, Chavundaraya Purana of 978 CE, is an important work in Kannada prose. Many classics were written on various subjects ranging from religion to elephant management.|$|E

5|$|Heterodontosaurus {{is known}} from fossils found in {{formations}} of the Karoo Supergroup, including the Upper Elliot Formation and the Clarens Formation, which {{date to the}} Hettangian and Sinemurian ages of the Lower Jurassic, around 200-190million years ago. Originally, Heterodontosaurus {{was thought to be}} from the Upper Triassic period. The Upper Elliot Formation consists of red/purple mudstone and red/white sandstone, whereas the slightly younger Clarens Formation consists of white/cream-coloured sandstone. The Clarens Formation is less rich in fossils than the Upper Elliot Formation; its sediments also often form cliffs, restricting accessibility for fossil hunters. The Upper Elliot Formation is characterised by animals that appear to be more lightly built than those of the Lower Elliot Formation, which may have been an adaptation to the drier climate at this time in southern Africa. Both formations are <b>famous</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> abundant vertebrate fossils, including temnospondyl amphibians, turtles, lepidosaurs, aetosaurs, crocodylomorphs, and non-mammal cynodonts.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds are <b>famous</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> song repertoires. Studies {{have shown}} that males sing songs at the {{beginning}} of breeding season to attract females. Unmated males sing songs in more directions and sing more bouts than mated males. In addition, unmated males perform more flight displays than mated males. The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season. Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status, a male mockingbird will vary his song production. The unmated male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male. Unmated males {{are also more likely to}} use elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range. Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous, mated males have been known to sing to attract additional mates.|$|E
5|$|The Triassic rocks {{consist of}} red marls, sandstones, breccias and {{conglomerates}} which {{spread over the}} older rocks. The Dolomitic Conglomerate is an old shingle beach of Keuper Marl age. The Rhaetic Beds are full of fossils due to invasion of the Jurassic Sea. The Lias consists of clays and limestones, the latter being quarried and are <b>famous</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> fossils. Blue Lias was burnt locally to provide a source of lime for making lime mortar. It is still used as a decorative building stone. Blue Lias {{is believed to have}} been quarried on the Polden Hills as early as the 15th century and was quarried in Puriton from the early 19th century until 1973, when the local cement works closed.|$|E

5|$|The main ore {{of mercury}} is cinnabar, long {{used as a}} pigment by painters. He says that the colour is similar to scolecium, {{probably}} the kermes insect. The dust is very toxic, so workers handling the material wear face masks of bladder skin. Copper and bronze are, says Pliny, most <b>famous</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> use in statues including colossi, gigantic statues as tall as towers, the most famous being the Colossus of Rhodes. He personally saw the massive statue of Nero in Rome, which was removed after the emperor's death. The face of the statue was modified shortly after Nero's death during Vespasian's reign, {{to make it a}} statue of Sol. Hadrian moved it, {{with the help of the}} architect Decrianus and 24 elephants, to a position next to the Flavian Amphitheatre (now called the Colosseum).|$|E
5|$|The {{overseas}} Chinese {{have contributed}} {{to the development of the}} town since their immigration in the late 19th century. The immigrants to Sandakan were farmers and labourers while some of them worked as businessmen and entrepreneurs. In the modern days, Sandakan have been poised to become one of Sabah business hubs. The town itself is one of Sabah's major port, other than in Kota Kinabalu, Sepanggar Bay, Tawau, Lahad Datu, Kudat, Semporna and Kunak. Sandakan district is known for its eco-tourism centres, such as the orangutan rehabilitation station in Sepilok Rehabilitation Centre, the Turtle Islands Park, the Kinabatangan River and the Gomantong Caves which are <b>famous</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> edible bird's nest. Due to Sandakan geographical proximity to Southern Philippines, there is also a barter trade connection and Sandakan is considered as a transit point for food entering the Southern Philippines. The state government has been assisting traders to improve their trading system and providing infrastructure facilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Rhynie in Aberdeenshire {{is the site}} of an {{important}} sedimentary deposit - Rhynie chert. The bulk of this fossil bed consists of primitive plants that had water-conducting cells and sporangia but no leaves, along with arthropods: Collembola, Opiliones (harvestmen), pseudoscorpions and the extinct, spider-like Trigonotarbids. This fossil bed is remarkable for two reasons. Firstly, the age of the find (early Devonian circa 410 Ma) makes this one of the earliest sites anywhere containing terrestrial fossils, coinciding with the first stages of the colonisation of land by plants and animals. Secondly, these cherts are <b>famous</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> exceptional state of ultrastructural preservation, with individual cell walls easily visible in polished specimens. For example, stomata have been counted and lignin remnants detected in the plant material.|$|E

5|$|Rome's forces used typical Roman {{equipment}} including pila (heavy javelins) and hastae (thrusting spears) {{as weapons}} {{as well as}} traditional helmets, shields and body armor. On the other hand, the Carthaginian army {{used a variety of}} equipment. The Iberians fought with swords suited for cutting and thrusting, as well as javelins and various types of spears. For defense, Iberian warriors carried large oval shields and the falcata. The Gauls were likely wearing no armor, and the typical Gallic weapon was usually a long, slashing sword. The heavy Carthaginian cavalry carried two javelins and a curved slashing sword, with a heavy shield for protection. The Numidian cavalry were very lightly equipped, lacking saddles and bridles for their horses, and used no armor but carried small shields, javelins and possibly a knife or longer blade. Skirmishers acting as light infantry carried either slings or spears. The Balearic slingers, who were <b>famous</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> accuracy, carried short, medium and long slings used to cast stones or bullets. They may have carried a small shield or simple leather pelt on their arms, but this is uncertain. Hannibal himself was wearing musculata armor and carried a falcata as well.|$|E
5|$|The Luna Sharpshooters was a {{short-lived}} unit formed by Luna to serve under the Philippine Revolutionary Army. On 11 February, eight infantrymen, formerly under Captains Márquez and Jaro, were sent by then Secretary of War Baldomero Aguinaldo to Luna, then Assistant Secretary of War. The infantrymen were disarmed by the Americans. So, they journeyed to be commissioned {{in the regular}} Filipino army. Seeing their desire {{to serve in the}} army, Luna took them in and from their group grew and emerged as the Luna Sharpshooters. The sharpshooters became <b>famous</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> fierce fighting and proved their worth by being the usual spearheading unit in every major battle in the Philippine-American War. After the Battle of Calumpit on 25–27 April 1899, only seven or eight of them remained in the regular Filipino army. In the Battle of Paye on 18 December 1899, a Filipino sharpshooter, Private Bonifacio Mariano, under the command of General Licerio Gerónimo killed General Henry Ware Lawton, making the latter the highest ranking casualty {{during the course of the}} war.|$|E
