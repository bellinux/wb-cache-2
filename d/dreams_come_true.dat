In June 2010, she and producer Steve Morales commenced work on her unreleased second studio album. The following month, Montag filed for divorce from Pratt, citing irreconcilable differences in the petition. However, they called it off in September after confessing that the action was intended to boost Montag's ailing career. In November, they renewed their vows in Carpinteria, California. In February 2011, Montag made her feature film debut as Kimberly in Just Go with It. Later that year, she appeared on the VH1 reality television series Famous Food, where she competed against other celebrities for a partnership stake in a restaurant in which they worked to open. In October, Montag began writing a memoir. The following year, she released her third extended play <b>Dreams</b> <b>Come</b> <b>True.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sonic the Hedgehog {{was created}} by the newly formed Sonic Team, a 15-member Sega {{subsidiary}} formed to create a character that could compete with Nintendo's Mario. The game's level design was handled by Hirokazu Yasuhara, and the musical theme was composed by Masato Nakamura from the Japanese band <b>Dreams</b> <b>Come</b> <b>True.</b> In designing Green Hill, Yasuhara was inspired by the U.S. state of California, while the game's color scheme in general was influenced by the work of pop artist Eizin Suzuki. While the original game was a 2D side-scroller, Green Hill was remade in full 3D as a secret level in the 2001 game Sonic Adventure 2; the player unlocks it after collecting all 180 of the emblems found by completing the game's many objectives. The 2011 game Sonic Generations, a title that revisits past entries in the Sonic series, features both 2D ("Classic") and 3D ("Modern") versions of Green Hill, as well as of numerous other Sonic levels. A reinterpretation of the level appears in the 2017 title Sonic Mania. Green Hill Zone reappears in Sonic Forces, having partially turned to desert due to resource depletion by Eggman's industries.|$|E

500|$|The {{music for}} Sonic the Hedgehog was {{composed}} by Masato Nakamura, bassist and songwriter of the J-pop band <b>Dreams</b> <b>Come</b> <b>True.</b> Nakamura {{stated that he}} was surprised when asked to create the soundtrack for Sonic the Hedgehog, as he had just started with <b>Dreams</b> <b>Come</b> <b>True.</b> He {{wanted to do it}} because Sega said the game was going to be better than Mario, and was inspired by the team's desire to outperform Nintendo. He adapted the Genesis' sound chip, and believed the hardest part of creating the soundtrack was the number of sounds that could play concurrently: he was limited to four, and said that his lack of knowledge of music on computers made it [...] "impossible". Nakamura wrote the soundtrack concurrently with [...] "Million Kisses", a studio album for <b>Dreams</b> <b>Come</b> <b>True.</b>|$|E
