Recurrent events data occur frequently in business, engineering, biological and medical fields. In this dissertation we focus on the medical applications (e. g. seizures, heart attacks, cancerous tumors, etc.). However, our proposed methods can be applied to other areas as well. Generally speaking, it is important to use appropriate models for the expected number of events, and sometimes this can be facilitated by modeling the cumulative intensity function or its derivative, the <b>intensity</b> <b>rate.</b> We can interpret the <b>intensity</b> <b>rate</b> as the chance of an individual experiencing the event of interest in the next moment. Modeling the <b>intensity</b> <b>rate</b> function has several advantages. We can incorporate covariates in the specification of the form of the <b>intensity</b> <b>rate</b> in order to determine predictors of the event occurrence. Also, modeling this function allows us to use all available data for an individual, rather than modeling only the first event, as in traditional survival analysis. One particular recurrent events scenario involves individuals experiencing events according to a common <b>intensity</b> <b>rate,</b> and then a treatment may be applied. Assuming the treatment to be effective, the individuals would be expected to follow a different <b>intensity</b> <b>rate</b> after receiving the treatment. Further, the treatment might be effective for a limited amount of time, so that a third rate would govern arrivals of the recurrent events after the effects of the treatment wore out. The points in time where the rate changes are called change-points. Recently, much work has been done on modeling recurrent events; and separately, on modeling hazard rates (one event per subject) with unknown change-points. However, to date, there are few methods to accommodate unknown change-points in the case of recurrent events. In this dissertation, we propose new methods to analyze such situations. Specifically, we will analyze two kinds of data, actual event and panel count. The first involves observing the exact time of each recurrent event, while the second consists of counts of events from successive intervals. Thus, panel count data is essentially interval censoring extended to recurrent events. We develop methods to fit a piecewise constant model for the <b>intensity</b> <b>rate,</b> which includes an unknown change-point. We also allow models for the <b>intensity</b> <b>rate</b> to be at first decreasing and then change to increasing (and vice versa), and estimate the location of this change...|$|R
40|$|Time to event {{data have}} long been {{important}} in many applied fields. Many models and analysis methods {{have been developed for}} this type of data in which each sample unit experiences at most a single end-of-life event. In contrast, many applications involve repeated events, where a subject or sampling unit experiences more than one event. There is growing interest in the analysis of recurrent events data, also called repeated events and recurrence data. This type of data arises in many fields. For example, the repair history of manufactured items can be modeled as recurrent events. In medical studies, the times of recurrent disease episodes in patients can also be modeled as recurrent events. In this paper we focus on medical applications (e. g. Â seizures, heart attacks, cancerous tumors, etc.). However, our proposed methodologies can be applied to other areas as well. For analyzing recurrence data, the first and perhaps most important step is to model the expected number of events, and sometimes this can be facilitated by modeling the cumulative intensity function or its derivative, the <b>intensity</b> <b>rate</b> function. One particular recurrent events scenario involves patients experiencing events according to a common <b>intensity</b> <b>rate,</b> and then a treatment may be applied. Assuming the treatment to be effective, the patients would be expected to follow a different <b>intensity</b> <b>rate</b> after receiving the treatment. Further, the treatment might be effective for a limited amount of time, so that a third rate would govern arrivals of the recurrent events after the effects of the treatment wore out. In this paper we model the <b>intensity</b> <b>rate</b> for such scenarios. In particular we allow models for the <b>intensity</b> <b>rate,</b> post-treatment, to be piecewise constant. Two estimators of the location of this change are proposed. Properties of the estimators are discussed. An example is studied for illustrative purposes. ...|$|R

Estimating the intensity of outbursts of coal and gas plays an important role because of its relation with the risk value. In this paper, we described the semiquantitative relations between major parameters and intensity of outburst based on physical experiments. The results showed increment of geostress simulated by horizontal load (from 1. 4, 2. 4, 3. 2, to 3. 4 [*]MPa) or vertical load (from 2, 3, 3. 6, to 4 [*]MPa) improved the relative <b>intensity</b> <b>rate</b> (3. 763 – 7. 403 % and 1. 273 – 7. 99 %); the increment of porosity (from 1. 57, 2. 51, 3, to 3. 6 %) improved the relative <b>intensity</b> <b>rate</b> from 3. 8 to 13. 8 %; the increment of gas pressure (from 0, 0. 5, 0. 65, 0. 72, 1, to 1. 5 [*]Mpa) induced the relative <b>intensity</b> <b>rate</b> to decrease from 38. 22 to 0 %; the increment of water content (from 0, 2, 4, to 8 %) caused the relative <b>intensity</b> <b>rate</b> to drop from 5. 425 to 0. 5 %.

40|$|The {{history of}} tornado <b>intensity</b> <b>rating</b> in the United States of America (USA), pioneered by T. Fujita, is reviewed, showing that non-meteorological {{changes in the}} {{climatology}} of the tornado intensity ratings are likely, raising questions about the temporal (and spatial) consistency of the ratings. Although the Fujita scale (F-scale) originally was formulated as a peak wind speed scale for tornadoes, it necessarily has been implemented using damage to estimate the wind speed. Complexities of the damage-wind speed relationship are discussed. Recently, the Fujita scale has been replaced in the USA as the official system for <b>rating</b> tornado <b>intensity</b> by the so-called Enhanced Fujita scale (EF-scale). Several features of the new rating system are reviewed and discussed {{in the context of}} a proposed set of desirable features of a tornado <b>intensity</b> <b>rating</b> system. It is concluded that adoption of the EF-scale in the USA may have been premature, especially if it is to serve as a model for how to <b>rate</b> tornado <b>intensity</b> outside of the USA. This is in large part because its degree of damage measures used for estimating wind speeds are based on USAspecific construction practices. It is also concluded that the USA's tornado <b>intensity</b> <b>rating</b> system has been compromised by secular changes in how the F-scale has been applied, most recently by the adoption of the EF-scale. Several recommendations are offered as possible ways to help develop an improved rating system that will be applicable worldwide...|$|R

This paper extends the accepted international classic pain <b>intensity</b> <b>rating</b> scales to fuzzy set theory obtaining the fuzzy visual analog scale (FVAS), fuzzy numerical rating scale (FNRS), fuzzy qualitative pain scale (FQPS), and fuzzy face pain scale (FFPS). These fuzzy pain intensity scales take into account positive characteristics concerning classic pain intensity scales meanwhile represent the inherent imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness presented in the pain report and assessment.

40|$|The strain <b>rate</b> <b>intensity</b> {{factor is}} the {{coefficient}} of the leading singular term in a series expansion of the equivalent strain rate {{in the vicinity of}} maximum friction surfaces. In the case of rigid perfectly plastic solids, the maximum friction law postulates that the friction stress at sliding is equal to the shear yield stress. The equivalent strain rate approaches infinity near maximum friction surfaces. Therefore, the strain <b>rate</b> <b>intensity</b> factor cannot be calculated by means of standard finite element packages. On the other hand, the strain <b>rate</b> <b>intensity</b> factor can be used to predict the generation of fine grain layers in the vicinity of friction surfaces in metal forming processes. In order to develop a model that connects the strain <b>rate</b> <b>intensity</b> factor and parameters characterizing such layers, it is necessary to propose a numerical method for calculating the strain <b>rate</b> <b>intensity</b> factor with a high accuracy. In the present paper, the strain <b>rate</b> <b>intensity</b> factor is expressed in terms of quantities that are found by means of conventional numerical methods based on the theory of characteristics. Then, an available numerical method is complemented with an additional procedure to find the strain <b>rate</b> <b>intensity</b> factor.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} muscle pain <b>intensity</b> <b>rating</b> using a 10 -point category-ratio pain intensity scale during self-paced cycling exercise within three trials. Eleven subjects (age 21. 4 ± 2. 6 years; VO 2 peak 3. 3 ± 0. 9 L·min- 1) performed a 60 -min cycling trial on three occasions. During each trial subjects cycled at the utmost work intensity for 60 -min. To simulate competitive training, 1 -min maximal effort sprints were performed every 10 -mins into the trial. Ambient temperature and relative humidity were set at 33 ± 0. 7 oC and 63 ± 2. 0 %, respectively. During exercise, subjects ranked the muscle pain intensity at 5 min intervals and following each sprint effort. Simple main effects revealed that muscle pain intensity ratings were significantly lower in trial 3 compared with trial 1 at the 50 min [F = 4. 5 (2 30); p = 0. 015, eta 2 = 0. 05], 55 min [F = 4. 89 (2, 30); p = 0. 011; eta 2 = 0. 05], and 60 min [F = 3. 6 (2, 30); p = 0. 034; eta 2 = 0. 04] time interval. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant increase in the mean distance cycled amongst the trials (p < 0001). These results indicate an attenuation in muscle pain <b>intensity</b> <b>rating</b> with endurance exercise training when performed over three trials. The reduced pain <b>intensity</b> <b>rating</b> may be due to adjustments in cadence and gear selection amongst the trials...|$|R
