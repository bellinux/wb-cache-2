50|$|The {{relationship}} between T. muris and bacteria {{also has a}} significant effect on the host's immune response.

Hayes et al., treated AKR and SCID (severe combined immunodeficient) mice with <b>enrofloxacin,</b> a fluoroquinoline antibiotic, in order to observe potential effects on worm establishment. The activation of type 2 helper cells (Th2) is decreased in the presence of antibiotics because there are fewer whipworms binding to the intestinal walls. This in turn drives up the proliferation and differentiation of Th17 and Th1 cells. Eighteen days after infection, the worm burden in antibiotically-treated mice was drastically reduced (P<0.001), further supporting the notion that bacteria are essential to the worms' establishment.|$|E

Cells with accumulated <b>enrofloxacin</b> brought into enrofloxacin-free medium released approximately 80 % (AMs) to 90 % (PMNs) of their <b>enrofloxacin</b> {{within the first}} 10 min, after which no further release was seen. <b>Enrofloxacin</b> affected neither the viability of PMNs and AMs nor the chemotaxis of PMNs at concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 μg/ml. <b>Enrofloxacin</b> (0. 5 μg/ml) did not alter the capability of PMNs and AMs to phagocytize fluorescent microparticles or Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, and Staphylococcus aureus. Significant differences in intracellular killing were seen with <b>enrofloxacin</b> at 5 × the MIC compared with that for controls not treated with <b>enrofloxacin.</b> PMNs killed all S. aureus isolates in 3 h with or without <b>enrofloxacin.</b> Intracellular S. aureus isolates in AMs were less susceptible than extracellular S. aureus isolates to the bactericidal effect of <b>enrofloxacin.</b> P. multocida was not phagocytosed by PMNs.

Intraphagocytic killing of A. pleuropneumoniae was significantly enhanced by <b>enrofloxacin</b> at 5 × the MIC in both PMNs and AMs. AMs are very susceptible to the A. pleuropneumoniae cytotoxin.

40|$|Abstract. The {{consequences}} of drug residues ’ presence in animal organism and food products {{of animal origin}} represent an actual problem, due to the high diversity of drugs used for therapy. The presence of residues in food products is accepted under some maximum residues limits (MRLs) that are strictly established and accepted for each type of molecule. The aim of this research was the comparative study of <b>enrofloxacin</b> and ciprofloxacin residues depletion in pork after the administration to pigs of two <b>enrofloxacin</b> pharmaceutical forms (oral solution 10 % and powder 40 %), for 5 days, in the manufacturer’s recommended doses. The pigs were slaughtered at various time intervals after treatment’s interruption; the samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography method (HPLC). Considering the pharmacokinetics of <b>enrofloxacin</b> (ciprofloxacin is a metabolite of <b>enrofloxacin),</b> residues level in pork was presented as sum of <b>enrofloxacin</b> and ciprofloxacin in mg/kg. After the administration of <b>enrofloxacin</b> to pigs, the depletion of <b>enrofloxacin</b> and ciprofloxacin residues in pork meat was generally balanced, but the biggest amount of <b>enrofloxacin</b> wass eliminated especially during the first days after treatment’s interruption.

Mice were made neutropenic by treatment with cyclophosphamide and injected in the thigh muscle with approximately 10 (6) colony-forming units of E coli (n = 2) or a staphylococcal (n = 2) clinical isolate. <b>Enrofloxacin</b> dosages tested ranged from 0. 78 to 50 mg/kg of body weight and 6. 25 to 200 mg/kg in the E coli and staphylococcal infection trials, respectively.

Pharmacokinetic values analyzed by use of multivariant stepwise linear regression analysis indicated that the area under the concentration-time curve, but not time above minimum inhibitory concentration, was significant in predicting efficacy of <b>enrofloxacin</b> treatment.

40|$|<b>Enrofloxacin</b> {{belongs to}} the {{fluoroquinolone}} class of antibiotics.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the pharmacokinetics of <b>enrofloxacin</b> and ciprofloxacin after a single intracoelomic injection of 10 mg/kg of <b>enrofloxacin</b> in 9 tortoises (Testudo hermanni).

Plasma concentration of <b>enrofloxacin</b> was quantifiable in all subjects up to 240 h, while ciprofloxacin was detected in all subjects up to 120 h. The Cmax(s) of <b>enrofloxacin</b> and ciprofloxacin were 8614 ± 1116 ng/mL obtained at 2. 19 h and 605 ± 43 ng/mL obtained at 4. 23 h, respectively.
