The {{time series}} {{are allowed to}} be an unknown mixture of stationary and unit root processes with possible cointegrating relations. The cross-sectional dependence is modeled with a factor structure. We extend the factor analysis in Bai and Ng (2002, Econometrica 70, 91 [...] 221) to vector processes. The fully modified (FM) estimator in Phillips (1995) is used for estimation in panel VAR and we also propose a <b>factor</b> augmented <b>FM</b> estimator. Our simulation results show this <b>factor</b> augmented <b>FM</b> estimator performs well when sample size is large. Copyright � 2008 The Author.

The regeneration characteristics are investigated by comparing the Nu, hsf and NTU between the both regenerators under oscillating flow conditions.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the relationship between anthropometric <b>factors</b> (<b>FM,</b> LBM and BMI) and BMD of lumbar spine in athletic (runners) and non athletic premenopausal women. Materials and Method: The subjects included 15 female athletes and 15 female non-athletes (30 - 45 years). All female runners (experimental group) were running 8 km in each session, 3 sessions per week for at least 4 years. However, the control group (female non-athletes) had no specific sport activity. Body Mass Index (BMI) of subjects was calculated manually. BMD, FM and LBM also measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Results: The results showed that in the experimental group there is a significant relationship between LBM and BMD of lumbar spine and in the control group, FM and BMD of lumbar spine were related tp each other significantly. The results also showed that there is not relationship between BMI and BMD of lumbar spine in the two groups.

The aim {{of this study was to}} obtain an expanded nixtamalized snack with whole blue corn and using the extrusion process, to preserve the highest possible total anthocyanin content, intense blue/purple coloration (color b) and the highest expansion index. A central composite experimental design was used. The extrusion process factors were: feed moisture (FM, 15 %– 23 %), calcium hydroxide concentration (CHC, 0 %– 0. 25 %) and final extruder temperature (T, 110 – 150 °C). The chemical and physical properties evaluated in the extrudates were moisture content (MC, %), total anthocyanins (TA, mg·kg− 1), pH, color (L, a, b) and expansion index (EI). ANOVA and surface response methodology were applied to evaluate the effects of the extrusion <b>factors.</b> <b>FM</b> and T significantly affected the response variables.

The predicted extrusion processing factors were highly accurate, yielding an expanded nixtamalized snack with 158. 87 mg·kg− 1 TA (estimated: 160 mg·kg− 1), an EI of 3. 19 (estimated: 2. 66), and color parameter b of − 0. 44 (estimated: 0. 10) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{mathematical}} {{description of}} the solar wind flow-tube geometry is proposed. The ex-pansion factor of the flow tube f (r) (= a/r 2, r is the heliocentric distance and a is the flow-tube cross-section area) increases monotonically from 1 at the coronal base to fm at rc, and approaches its asymptotic value f ∞ nearly in a width of 2 σc. The flow tube with fm = f ∞ is demonstrated to be approximately equivalent to that given by Kopp and Holzer (1976) for the fast solar wind, and it presumably represents slow wind tubes as fm is substantially larger than f∞. In terms of an Alfvén wave-driven solar wind model, {{the effect of the}} flow-tube geometry on solar wind properties is examined. It is found that with the same flow conditions at the coronal base an expansion factor which increases monotonically with the radial distance results in a fast solar wind solution, whereas a flow tube which undergoes an expansion-contraction-reexpansion process creates a slow solar wind solution. Among the four flow-tube parameters the maximum expansion <b>factor</b> <b>fm</b> has the strongest effect, and the associated Laval-nozzle formed by the contraction and reexpansion of the flow tube plays a crucial role in determining solar wind properties. It is suggested that one must take the effect of the flow-tube geometry into account while constructing reasonable flow-tube models for the slow solar wind. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUnderstanding {{the heat}} {{transfer}} mechanism from the combustion gases {{to the walls}} inside an internal combustion engine is key {{in the search for}} higher efficiencies, higher power outputs and lower emissions. Current heat transfer modeling concepts have been reported to be inaccurate for hydrogen engines. To investigate the heat transfer mechanisms in a hydrogen engine, we have measured the instantaneous heat loss inside a spark-ignition engine at three locations. To determine the effect of the throttle position, compression ratio, ignition timing and air-to-fuel ratio in the entire parameter space systematically, techniques of Design of Experiments are applied. The experiment has been repeated for methane, gasoline and methanol to compare hydrogen with other fuels and to build a database {{for the development of a}} fuel independent heat transfer model. The paper shows that the effect of the <b>engine</b> <b>factors</b> is similar for all the fuels. However, the heat loss to the cylinder walls of hydrogen is only at the same level of that of the other fuels for very lean mixtures. The engine efficiency drastically reduces for rich mixtures as a consequence, indicating that a lean mixture in combination with boosting and external gas recirculation should be used to obtain high power outputs with high efficiencies for port fuel injected engines...|$|R
