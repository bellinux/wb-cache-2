40|$|The {{prevalence}} of pain ranges from 27. 8 % to 86. 5 % <b>in</b> nursing <b>homes</b> and 42 % to 50 % <b>in</b> <b>home</b> care. Pain assessment {{is the first}} step toward effective pain management. The aim of this study was to explore the use of pain assessment strategies (verbal, numeric, and observation rating scales and standardized questions) <b>in</b> <b>home</b> care and nursing homes. The study was a descriptive cross-sectional survey. Health care providers who were responsible for the patients' medications replied to a questionnaire. In-home care and nursing <b>homes</b> <b>in</b> 11 randomly selected municipalities in Mid-Norway were included. Three hundred ninety-two individuals were included in this study (70 % response rate) : 271 (69 %) from nursing homes and 121 (31 %) from home care. The respondents working <b>in</b> <b>home</b> care had a higher educational level than those in working <b>in</b> nursing <b>homes.</b> Pain assessment instruments were not used frequently <b>in</b> nursing <b>homes</b> and home care. Verbal and numeric rating scales were used significantly more frequently <b>in</b> <b>home</b> care than <b>in</b> nursing <b>homes.</b> Registered nurses (RNs) <b>in</b> nursing <b>homes</b> used standardized questions significantly more often than did RNs <b>in</b> <b>home</b> care. RNs and social educators <b>in</b> <b>home</b> care self-reported less competence in treating the patients' total pain experience than did those <b>in</b> nursing <b>homes.</b> Workplace (working <b>in</b> <b>home</b> care) and regular training in the use of pain assessment tools explained more than 20 % of the variation in the use of pain assessment tools. Regular training in the use of pain assessment tools is needed for health care workers <b>in</b> <b>home</b> care and nursing homes...|$|R

5|$|Several {{recent studies}} attempt {{to examine the}} effects of chronic low-dose {{manganese}} overexposure on child development. The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300µg Mn/L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400µg Mn/L by the World Health Organization, the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living <b>in</b> <b>homes</b> that received water from a well containing 610µg Mn/L; controls lived <b>in</b> <b>homes</b> that received water from a 160µg Mn/L well.

5|$|Cagebirds such as canaries, budgerigars, cockatoos, lovebirds, quails, finches, and parrots {{are popular}} pets, whether for their song, their behaviour, their {{colourful}} plumage, or {{their ability to}} mimic speech.

5|$|Carpet beetles {{are members}} of the family Dermestidae, and while the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen, the larvae are {{destructive}} pests <b>in</b> <b>homes,</b> warehouses and museums. They feed on animal products including wool, silk, leather, fur, the bristles of hair brushes, pet hair, feathers and museum specimens. They tend to infest hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths, leaving behind specks of excrement and brown, hollow, bristly-looking cast skins. Management of infestations is difficult and is based on exclusion and sanitation where possible, resorting to pesticides when necessary. The beetles can fly in from outdoors and the larvae can survive on lint fragments, dust and inside the bags of vacuum cleaners. In warehouses and museums, sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems, and heating, freezing, spraying the surface with insecticide and fumigation will kill the insects when suitably applied. Susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them in clean airtight containers.|$|E
