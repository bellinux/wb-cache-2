25|$|When {{consciousness}} {{reaches the}} fourth plane, it <b>finds</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> a very particular state. It is fully {{conscious of the}} infinite potential of energy and can make full use of it and it also becomes aware of the mental world. This new contact creates very strong desires {{to make use of}} this huge potential. At this point consciousness <b>finds</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> the biggest danger of its long development. Not being able to control its feelings or thoughts, the soul is strongly tempted to handle infinite energy. If the infinite potential of this plane is misused, consciousness gets completely disintegrated and the soul finds itself back to the stone-form consciousness and has to start again the long course of evolution from there. If it abstains from using this energy it enters the lower mental plane and if it makes a completely selfless use of it, {{for the benefit of the}} spiritual development of others in illusion, it even moves directly to the higher mental plane.|$|E

There have also been efforts to add more computers to schools and universities.

25|$|Medicare <b>finds</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> the odd {{position}} of having assumed control of graduate medical education, currently facing major budget constraints, and as a result, freezing funding for graduate medical education, {{as well as for}} physician reimbursement rates. This halt in funding in turn exacerbates the exact problem Medicare sought to solve in the first place: improving the availability of medical care. However, some healthcare administration experts believe that the shortage of physicians may be an opportunity for providers to reorganize their delivery systems to become less costly and more efficient. Physicians' assistants and Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners may begin assuming more responsibilities that traditionally fell to doctors, but do not necessarily require the advanced training and skill of a physician.|$|E
25|$|Although the Chilean rodeo was {{declared}} a national sport, it <b>finds</b> <b>itself</b> <b>in</b> a precarious position {{in terms of}} finances, political support and promotion. Part {{of the reason for}} this is that the federation does not receive any of the revenue of Chiledeportes like the rest of sports federations in Chile. This is because only sports that represent Chile overseas receive funds. The Chilean Rodeo Federation has been critical of the government for the lack of funds towards the sport, arguing that because in many parts of the country, due to the distance from population centers, sporting events do not arrive, the local population turn to the rodeo as their primary pass time throughout the Chilean rural territory. Nevertheless, thanks to the commitment and support of its many fans, the rodeo has maintained its popularity, especially in the rural areas, and its status as the second most popular sport in Chile.|$|E

2500|$|Starting in the mid-20th century, {{religious}} fundamentalists and {{the religious}} right began using the term [...] "secular humanism" [...] in hostile fashion. Francis A.

Schaeffer portrayed secular humanism as pernicious and diabolical, and warned it would undermine the moral and spiritual tablet of America. His themes have been very widely repeated in Fundamentalist preaching in North America.
