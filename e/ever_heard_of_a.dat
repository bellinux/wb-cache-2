500|$|The {{television}} series Castle, where Fillion plays the lead character Richard Castle, has made ongoing homages to Firefly. [...] Castle has props from Firefly as decorative items in his home, has {{dressed up as}} a [...] "space cowboy" [...] for Halloween ("You wore that five years ago," [...] cracked his daughter), speaks Chinese that he learned from [...] "a TV show [...] loved", and has made rapid [...] "two-by-two" [...] finger motions while wearing blue surgical gloves. [...] He has been humorously asked if he has <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spa known as [...] "Serenity", and Firefly catchphrases such as [...] "shiny", [...] "special hell", and [...] "I was aiming for the head" [...] {{have been used as}} punchlines during various dramatic scenes in Castle.

They bring an unique perspective often missing in global challenges," [...] Elbegdorj said [...] "Have you <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman bloody dictator or tyrant? I think not. If there were more women in power, I think we would have more harmony, more engagement and less suffering and less conflict." ...|$|E

Norman Fowler, then a reporter for The Times, interviewed Powell during the election and asked him what the biggest issue was: [...] "I expected to be told something about the cost of living but not a bit of it.

50|$|The Jews {{could be}} put down very plausibly as the most {{unpleasant}} race <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of.</b> <b>As</b> commonly encountered, they lack many of the qualities that mark the civilized man: courage, dignity, incorruptibility, ease, confidence. They have vanity without pride, voluptuousness without taste, and learning without wisdom.
