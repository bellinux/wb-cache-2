As a result of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, Tsang's government rolled out a package of financial stimulus of HK$11 billion and a depositor guarantee scheme to safeguard <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollar</b> savings in bank accounts. Hong Kong narrowly avoided a technical recession from the ongoing crisis.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollar</b> {{left its}} 16:1 peg with the Pound {{sterling}} and {{switched to the}} current US-HK Dollar peg. Hong Kong's competitiveness in manufacturing gradually declined due to rising labour and property costs, {{as well as new}} development in southern China under the Open Door Policy introduced in 1978 which opened up China to foreign business. Nevertheless, towards the early 1990s, Hong Kong had established itself as a global financial centre along with London and New York City, a regional hub for logistics and freight, one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia and the world's exemplar of Laissez-faire market policy.|$|E
5|$|The {{currency}}, <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollar,</b> is {{the thirteenth}} most traded currency {{in the world}} , it has been pegged to the US dollar since 1983. Hong Kong was once described by Milton Friedman as the world's greatest experiment in laissez-faire capitalism, but has since instituted a regime of regulations including a minimum wage. It maintains a highly developed capitalist economy, ranked the freest {{in the world by}} the Index of Economic Freedom every year since 1995. It is {{known as one of the}} Four Asian Tigers for its high growth rates and rapid development from the 1960s to the 1990s. Between 1961 and 1997 Hong Kong's gross domestic product grew 180 times while per-capita GDP increased 87 times over. In 2008, the territory was named as a Nylonkong global metropolis and financial centre.|$|E
50|$|In practice, in {{the unique}} linked {{exchange}} rate system, {{the exchange rate}} of HK$7.80 = US$1, is strictly controlled by the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> Monetary Authority in the foreign exchange market by controlling supply and demand of <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollars</b> in order to influence the exchange rate being fixed. By this arrangement the HKMA guarantees to exchange United States <b>dollar</b> into <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollars</b> and vice versa, {{at the rate of}} 7.80. When the market rate is below 7.80, the banks will convert United States <b>dollar</b> for <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollars</b> from the HKMA, <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollars</b> supply will increase, and the market rate will climb back to 7.80. The same mechanism also works when the market rate is above 7.80, and the banks will convert <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollars</b> for United States dollars.|$|R

The company also encouraged individual donations, in which the biggest donor in each store would be awarded 99 video rental coupons, while the biggest donor in <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> received 999 coupons. In addition, KPS also sold videos donated by their suppliers, and forwarded proceeds directly to Operation Santa Claus. That year, the video chain raised more than $472,000 on Christmas Day by renting its videos at $8 <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollars</b> a tape instead of $24 <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollars</b> [...] Another $14,220 was collected from donation boxes in the stores, while the chain itself donated a further $14,000 <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollars</b> to bring the overall total up to $500,000 <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollars.</b>|$|R
5|$|Usage of the Octopus {{card was}} {{extended}} to Macau and the Chinese city of Shenzhen in 2006. In collaboration with China UnionPay, Octopus Cards Limited introduced Octopus card usage to two Fairwood restaurants in Shenzhen in August 2006. In 2008, five Café de Coral locations in Shenzhen also started accepting Octopus. Value cannot be reloaded to Octopus cards in Shenzhen, but the Automatic Add Value Service is available to automatically deduct money value from a customer's credit card to reload an Octopus card. The two Fairwood restaurants in Shenzhen that were enabled for Octopus card payments are located at Luohu Commercial City and Shenzhen Railway Station. Shenzhen became the first city outside Hong Kong in which Octopus cards may be accepted as payment. In Macau, the Octopus card was introduced in December 2006 when two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in the territory adopted its usage as payment. Similar to its usage in Shenzhen, an Octopus card may not be reloaded in Macau, and the currency exchange rate between the Macanese pataca and the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollar</b> when using an Octopus card is MOP1:HKD1. The two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in Macau that adopted the Octopus card for payment are located at the Rua Do Campo and the Sands Casino.|$|E
25|$|Macau has a {{currency}} board system {{under which the}} legal tender, Macau pataca is 100 percent backed by foreign exchange reserves, in this case currently the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollar.</b> Moreover, the currency board, Monetary Authority of Macau (AMCM), has a statutory obligation to issue and redeem Macau pataca on demand against the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollar</b> at a fixed exchange rate of HK$1 = MOP$1.032, and without limit.|$|E
25|$|Although the pataca is {{the legal}} tender of Macau, the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollar</b> is almost universally {{acceptable}} in the Region, and in some cases, is preferred to the Pataca. Circulation of the pataca is mandated by a decree (Decreto-Lei n.º 16/95/M) prohibiting refusal by merchants, but some casinos flout this rule and refuse bets in patacas. The <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollar</b> and Chinese yuan are generally accepted throughout Macau from casinos to restaurants. Payments to government agencies can also be made in both Hong Kong dollars and patacas.|$|E
50|$|The {{trade between}} the two prospers nowadays.

25|$|Currently, the renminbi is the {{official}} currency of the People's Republic of China (PRC). It is the legal tender in mainland China, but not in Hong Kong or Macau. The special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau use the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollar</b> and the Macanese pataca, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Economically, all trading {{activities}} were sternly guarded, {{and the majority}} of the factories were taken over by the Imperial Japanese. Having deprived the vendors and banks of their possessions, the occupying forces outlawed the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>Dollar</b> and replaced it with the Japanese Military Yen. The exchange rate was fixed at 2 Hong Kong dollars to one military yen in January 1942. Later, the yen was re-valued at 4 Hong Kong dollars to a yen in July 1942, which meant local people could exchange fewer military notes than before. While the citizens of Hong Kong became poor in forced exchanges, the Imperial Japanese government sold the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>Dollar</b> to help finance their war-time economy. Later, the yen was made the sole legal tender for official purposes in June 1943. Prices of commodities for sale had to be marked in yen. Hyper-inflation then disrupted the economy, directly affecting Hong Kong citizens. Enormous devaluation of the Imperial Japanese Military Yen after the war made it almost worthless.|$|E

25|$|In the two Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China, {{arrangements}} {{are similar to}} those in the UK; in Hong Kong, three commercial banks are licensed to issue <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollar</b> notes, and in Macau, banknotes of the Macanese pataca are issued by two different commercial banks.

25|$|As {{one of the}} world's leading {{international}} financial centres, Hong Kong's service-oriented economy is characterized by its low taxation, almost free port trade and well established {{international financial}} market. Its currency, called the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollar,</b> is legally issued by three major international commercial banks, and pegged to the US dollar. Interest rates {{are determined by the}} individual banks in Hong Kong to ensure it is fully market-driven. There is no officially recognised central banking system, although Hong Kong Monetary Authority functions as a financial regulatory authority. When destabilising factors are hitting the financial market of Hong Kong, they will be monitored and inspected by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the financial regulatory agency in Hong Kong.

25|$|Political {{uncertainty}} {{following the}} country's 2008 general {{election and the}} 2008 Permatang Pauh by-election, falling oil prices in the late-2000s, {{and the lack of}} intervention by Bank Negara to increase already low interest rates (which remained at 3.5% between April 2006 and November 2008) led to a slight fall of the ringgit's value against the US dollar between May and July 2008, followed by a sharper drop between August and September of the same year. As a result, the US dollar appreciated significantly to close at 3.43 to the MYR as of 4 September 2008, while other major currencies, including the renminbi and <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollar,</b> followed suit. The ringgit spiked at 3.73 to the US dollar by March 2009, before gradually recovering to 3.00 to the US dollar by mid-2011 and normalising at around 3.10 between 2011 and 2014.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} the {{currency}} peg, the ringgit appreciated to as high as 3.16 to the US dollar in April 2008.

The initial stability of the ringgit in the late-2000s had led to considerations to reintroduce {{the currency}} to foreign trading. In a CNBC interview in September 2010, Najib Tun Razak, the then Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Malaysia, was quoted in stating that the government was planning the reentry of the ringgit into off-shore trading if the move will help the economy, with the condition that rules and regulations were put in place to prevent abuses.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1873, {{the silver}} dollar {{circulated}} {{in many parts}} of the world, with a value in relation to the British gold sovereign of roughly $1 = 4s 2d (21p approx). As a result of the decision of the German Empire to stop minting silver thaler coins in 1871, in the wake of the Franco-Prussian War, the worldwide price of silver began to fall. This resulted in the U.S. Coinage Act (1873) which put the United States onto a 'de facto' gold standard. Canada and Newfoundland were already on the gold standard, and the result was that the value of the dollar in North America increased in relation to silver dollars being used elsewhere, particularly Latin America and the Far East. By 1900, value of silver dollars had fallen to 50 percent of gold dollars. Following the abandonment of the gold standard by Canada in 1931, the Canadian dollar began to drift away from parity with the U.S. dollar. It returned to parity a few times, but since the end of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates that was agreed to in 1944, the Canadian dollar has been floating against the U.S. dollar. The silver dollars of Latin America and South East Asia began to diverge from each other as well during the course of the 20th century. The Straits dollar adopted a gold exchange standard in 1906 after it had been forced to rise in value against other silver dollars in the region. Hence, by 1935, when China and Hong Kong came off the silver standard, the Straits dollar was worth 2s 4d (11.5p approx) sterling, whereas the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>dollar</b> was worth only 1s 3d sterling (6p approx).|$|E
