5|$|The French Democracy {{begins with}} a re-enactment of the real-life 27 October 2005 event that {{triggered}} riots in France: the electrocution of two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traoré. In the film, the youths attempt to hide from police in a building near an electric power station. In a televised speech, the Minister of the Interior vows to increase efforts to fight crime. Three fictional Moroccan men discuss the recent events and disagree with means used by the police, and feel that blacks are unfairly targeted. They face different forms of discrimination: overnight detention {{for lack of a}} passport during an <b>identity</b> <b>check,</b> refusal of employment and housing rental, and police brutality. Angered, the three riot using Molotov cocktails. A white family watches television coverage of the chaos, and the film ends with a dedication to Benna and Traoré, lamenting the loss of the French ideals of freedom, equality, and fraternity.|$|E

However, the islands are part of the Nordic Passport Union and the Schengen Agreement {{provides}} that travellers passing between the islands and the Schengen Area are not to be treated as passing the external frontier of the Area. This means that there is an <b>identity</b> <b>check</b> at air or boat travel to the islands where Nordic citizens on intra-Nordic travel need no passport, only showing the ticket plus identity card.|$|E

500|$|At Joshua's apartment, they {{discover}} {{he has a}} twin brother Matthew and equipment used for a negative matter ring. Their investigation is cut short as {{they are forced to}} evacuate from a rigged bomb which destroys the apartment as they flee. Lee and Francis were unable to hear the bomb, but Olivia could, possibly indicating that she retains the enhanced hearing demonstrated in [...] "Night of Desirable Objects." [...] They travel to Matthew's home in the suburbs, meeting the brother, his wife, and their children. Matthew professes to no knowledge of the location of his brother. Olivia is suspicious of Matthew's behavior but does not explore further. Olivia's suspicion is shown to be correct as Matthew is revealed to have been the one trapped in the amber, having tried to come warn his brother about the quarantine. Joshua, having posed as Matthew for the last few years, was the one that freed him and spoke to Fringe. The brothers switch places again when Olivia requests a more detailed <b>identity</b> <b>check</b> from Matthew, which he passes successfully.|$|E
2500|$|It {{appeared}} that Gardner got his [...] "break" [...] {{when he was}} accepted into a training program at E.F. Hutton. He subsequently quit his sales job {{so that he could}} dedicate his time exclusively to training as a stockbroker. Then he appeared at the office ready to work, only to discover that his hiring manager had been fired the week before. To make matters worse, Gardner's relationship with Jackie was falling apart. According to Gardner, the police witnessed an incident in which Jackie was running away with Chris Jr. and Gardner attempted to take the child back, but in the process swung Jackie into the garden bushes, which resulted in her being scratched. Gardner was apprehended initially for this incident, but an <b>identity</b> <b>check</b> on his car license plate led them to detain him for non-payment of parking fines. He was taken to jail and a judge ordered that he stay there, for ten days, as punishment for being unable to pay $1,200 in parking tickets. Jackie then took Chris Jr. away to live with her on the East Coast, but she eventually decided not to press charges over the incident in which she was thrown into the bushes.|$|E
