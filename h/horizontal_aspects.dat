When network size is a relatively important factor in consumers' utilities, neither the larger nor smaller network in the unique asymmetric equilibrium wishes to be compatible.

40|$|Background: Decision-making in {{periodontal}} therapeutics {{is critical}} and {{is influenced by}} accurate diagnosis of osseous defects, especially furcation involvement. Commonly used diagnostic methods such as clinical probing and conventional radiography have their own limitations. Hence, this study was planned to evaluate the dimensions of furcation defects clinically (pre- and post-surgery), intra-surgically, and by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) (pre- and post-surgery). Materials and Methods: The study comprised a total of 200 Grade II furcation defects in forty patients, {{with a mean age}} of 38. 05 ± 4. 77 years diagnosed with chronic periodontitis which were evaluated clinically (pre- and post-surgically), by CBCT (pre- and post-surgically), and intrasurgically after flap reflection (40 defects in each). After the presurgical clinical and CBCT measurements, demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft was placed in the furcation defect and the flaps were sutured back. Six months later, these defects were evaluated by recording measurements clinically, i. e., postsurgery clinical measurements and also postsurgery CBCT measurements (40 defects each). Results: Presurgery clinical measurements (vertical 6. 15 ± 1. 71 mm and horizontal 3. 05 ± 0. 84 mm) and CBCT measurements (vertical 7. 69 ± 1. 67 mm and horizontal 4. 62 ± 0. 77 mm) underestimated intrasurgery measurements (vertical 8. 025 ± 1. 67 mm and horizontal 4. 82 ± 0. 67 mm) in both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>aspects,</b> and the difference was statistically not significant (vertical P = 1. 000, 95 % confidence interval [CI], horizontal P = 0. 867, 95 % CI). Further, postsurgery clinical measurements (vertical 2. 9 ± 0. 74 mm and horizontal 1. 52 ± 0. 59 mm) underestimated CBCT measurements (vertical 3. 67 ± 1. 17 mm and horizontal 2. 45 ± 0. 48 mm). There was statistically significant difference between presurgery clinical–presurgery CBCT (P < 0. 0001, 95 % CI) versus postsurgery clinical–postsurgery CBCT (P < 0. 0001, 95 % CI) values in both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>aspects.</b> Conclusion: The use of CBCT appears to be prudent for accurate diagnosis of furcation defects in advanced periodontal diseases.

40|$|My {{dissertation}} project {{seeks to}} understand {{when and how}} do national judges play an active and significant role in how international legal orders do or do not affect their polities. Specifically, I look at when and how British judges {{play a role in}} how European Union law through the European Court of Justice and European human rights law through the European Court of Human Rights affect the British polity. These international legal orders contain both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>aspects.</b> Vertical aspects include the highest court and its judges defined by the treaty, which operates as the international, hierarchical authority on the treaty and is tasked with ensuring the compliance of the member states of the treaty. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>aspects</b> include member state courts and judges who interact with other member state courts and judges as equals voluntarily to share an understanding of the law. Britain is interesting because it may seem like a counterintuitive place to find such dynamics. Britain has a strong resistance to international authority, a deeply entrenched idea of Parliamentary Supremacy, and a dualist legal tradition where Parliament translates international law into domestic law prior to its use by the courts, which contributes to a lack of expectation of British judges engaging in international judicial activism, making Britain a hard case. In this context, we should expect that international law only matters to the extent that domestic actors are forced to incorporate it by a strong international legal order with vertical supremacy and unambiguous authority. To the contrary, my dissertation shows that British judges are quite active in many international legal orders in ways that do not merely reflect the degree of established vertical legal authority. Through dynamics that are quite autonomous from British politicians' difficult interactions with international authority, British judges play a very active role in managing and integrating international law into British politics. To see these dynamics and understand how international law has affected British politics, we must pay special attention to horizontal legal integration. Horizontal legal integration occurs when judges intentionally and selectively borrow legal concepts and precedents from other national or international jurisdictions...|$|E

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} in window frames with internal air cavities is studied in this thesis. Investigations focus on two- and three-dimensional natural convection effects inside air cavities, {{the dependence of}} the emissivity on the thermal transmittance, and the emissivity of anodized and untreated aluminum profiles. The investigations are mostly conducted on window frames which are {{the same size as}} real frames found in residential buildings. Numerical and experimental investigations were performed to study the effectiveness of one commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) program for simulating combined natural convection and heat {{transfer in}} simple three-dimensional window frames with internal air cavities. The accuracy of the conjugate CFD simulations was evaluated by comparing results for surface temperature on the warm side of the specimens to results from experiments that use infrared (IR) thermography to map surface temperatures during steady-state thermal tests. In general, there was good agreement between the simulations and experiments. Two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics and conduction simulations are performed to study the difference between treating air cavities as a fluid and as a solid when calculating the thermal transmittance of window frames. The simulations show that traditional software codes, simulating only conduction and using equivalent conductivities for the air cavities, give U- values that compare well with results from fluid flow simulations. The difference between the two models are mostly limited to the temperature distribution inside air cavities. It is also found that cavities with an interconnection less than about 7 mm can be treated as separate cavities. Three-dimensional natural convection effects in simple and custom-made PVC and thermally broken aluminum window frames with one open internal cavity were studied, with the use of CFD simulations and thermography experiments. Focus was put on corner effects and heat transfer rates. From the results it appears that the thermal transmittance of a four-sided section can be found by calculating the average of the thermal transmittance of the respective single horizontal and vertical sections. In addition, it was found that two-dimensinal conduction heat transfer simulation software agrees well with tree-dimensional CFD simulations if the natural convection correlations used for the internal cavities are correct. Numerical studies were done with natural convection in three-dimensional cavities with a high vertical aspect ratio and a low <b>horizontal</b> <b>aspect</b> ratio. The cavities studied had vertical aspect ratios of 20, 40, and 80 and <b>horizontal</b> <b>aspect</b> ratios ranging from 0, 2 to 5. It was shown that three-dimensional cavities with a <b>horizontal</b> <b>aspect</b> ratio larger than five can be considered to be a two-dimensional cavity to within 4 % when considering heat transfer rates. Nusselt number correlations for the different <b>horizontal</b> <b>aspect</b> ratios are presented for cavities with vertical aspect ratios of 20 and 40. Complex multicellular flow was studied for the case where the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>aspect</b> ratios were 40 and 2, respectively. Experimental studies included the normal spectral and total emissivity of specimens from six meter long untreated and anodized aluminum profiles. Specimens facing the internal cavities (thermal break cavity and all aluminum cavity) were measured. Some masking tapes often used in hot box experiments were also measured. The normal total emissivity was found to be is fairly constant (between 0. 834 and 0. 856) for exterior parts of the anodized profile and for surfaces facing the thermal break cavity. The normal total emissivity of the all-aluminum internal cavities was found to vary between 0. 055 and 0. 82.

A recent study found mild dissonances to be more preferred than consonances in single chord perception, although the authors did not systematically vary register and consonance in their study; these omissions were explored here. An online empirical experiment was conducted where participants (N ¼ 410) evaluated chords on the dimensions of Valence, Tension, Energy, Consonance, and Preference; 15 different chords were played with piano timbre across two octaves. The results suggest significant differences on all dimensions across chord types, and {{a strong correlation between}} perceived dissonance and tension. The register and inversions contributed to the evaluations significantly, nonmusicians distinguishing between triadic inversions similarly to musicians. The mildly dissonant minor ninth, major ninth, and minor seventh chords were rated highest for preference, regardless of musical sophistication. The role of theoretical explanations such as aggregate dyadic consonance, the inverted-U hypothesis, and psychoacoustic roughness, harmonicity, and sharpness will be discussed to account for the preference of mild dissonance over consonance in single chord perception...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the relationship between Islam and modernity, it is important to begin with an understanding of the religion itself. Generically, Islam is a religion which brings the mission of liberation and salvation.

Thus, Islam highly respects the dimension of humanity. The presence of Islam as a moral source can be observed in its achievement in transforming pre-Islamic Arabic nomads into civilized communities with values and morality. With the presence of Islam, these communities, being used to living in open deserts and highly susceptible to inter-tribal wars and conflicts, achieved success becoming sensitized to elevated values and morality. Inter-tribal wars and conflict occurred because of their lack of values and morality, which terminated after Islam spread its teachings.

It defines integration in an open non-normative fashion as "the process of becoming an accepted part of society". For the study of integration processes and policies a heuristic model is presented encompassing three analytically distinct dimensions in which people may (or may not) become an accepted part of society: (i) the legal-political, (ii) the socio-economic, and (iii) the cultural-religious. Each dimension involves different parties (the immigrants themselves and the receiving society), different levels of analysis (the individual, collective, and institutional levels), and other relevant factors such as time and generations.

Following the earlier work [Zgheib et al. 2014 Theor. Comput. Fluid Dyn. 28, 521 - 529] which demonstrated that gravity currents initiating from non-axisymmetric cross-sectional geometries {{do not become}} axisymmetric, nor do they retain their initial shape during the slumping and inertial phases of spreading, we show that such non-axisymmetric currents eventually reach a self-similar regime during which (i) the local front propagation scales as t^(1 / 2) as in circular releases and (ii) the non-axisymmetric front has a self-similar shape that primarily depends on the aspect ratio of the initial release. Complementary experiments of non-Boussinesq currents and top-spreading currents suggest that this self-similar dynamics is independent of the density ratio, vertical aspect ratio, wall friction, and Reynolds number, provided Re is large, i. e., Re≥Ο(10 ^ 4). The local instantaneous front Froude number obtained from the fully-resolved simulations is compared to existing models of Froude functions. The recently reported extended box model (EBM) is capable of capturing the dynamics of such non-axisymmetric flows.

Empirical {{research on}} vertical harmony’s emotional qualities, however, has been rare. The main studies in harmony and emotions usually concern the <b>horizontal</b> <b>aspects</b> of harmony, ignoring emotional qualities of chords as such. An empirical experiment was conducted where participants (N = 269) evaluated pre-chosen chords on a 9 -item scale of given emotional dimensions. 14 different chords (major, minor, diminished, augmented triads and dominant, major and minor seventh chords with inversions) were played with two distinct timbres (piano and strings). The results suggest significant differences in emotion perception across chords. These were consistent with notions about musical conventions, while providing novel data on how seventh chords affect emotion perception. The inversions and timbre also contributed to the evaluations. Moreover, certain chords played on the strings scored moderately high on the dimension of ‘nostalgia/longing,’ which is usually held as a musical emotion rising only from extra-musical connotations and conditioning, not intrinsically from the structural features of the music. The role of background variables to the results was largely negligible, suggesting the capacity of vertical harmony to convey distinct emotional qualities to both naïve and expert listeners...|$|E

I hold that rhetoric is a necessary condition for implementing that policy in practice. To interpret rhetoric as a heuristic mediator between theory and practice enables us to understand the social and cultural resistance the innovation policy provokes.

40|$|The {{proposed}} Comcast-NBC Universal (NBCU) transaction {{is primarily}} a vertical merger that also has less significant horizontal components. The vertical aspect is {{the combination of a}} video producer (NBCU) and a video distributor (Comcast). The <b>horizontal</b> <b>aspects</b> are, first, adding NBCU’s programming, including NBC, Bravo, and others, to Comcast’s programming, including the Golf Channel, E!, and others and, second, adding NBC-owned broadcast stations to Comcast’s terrestrial video delivery network. Because Comcast’s national programming offerings are relatively small and because Comcast has promised to keep free over-the-air broadcasts of NBC, 1 most debate has focused on the vertical aspects of the transaction; I will focus on those vertical aspects today. Vertical mergers can have pro-competitive, efficiency-enhancing effects, but they can also have anticompetitive effects. The pro-competitive effects include aligning incentives between the upstream and downstream firms in ways that promote innovation and investment, eliminating double-marginalization and therefore lowering costs and prices, and reducing transactions costs associated with negotiations in which the upstream and downstream firms must otherwise engage. The potential anticompetitive effects from foreclosure or raising rivals ’ costs arise if market power in the downstream market creates the incentive and ability to leverage that power into the upstream market. The net effect of any vertical merger is, therefore, theoretically ambiguous. Empirical research of previous vertical transactions, however, tends to find positive outcomes. Professor...|$|E

These images are thresholded using the standard International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) thermal threshold algorithm. The individual clouds in the cloud fields are segmented to obtain their structural statistics which include size distribution, orientation angle, <b>horizontal</b> <b>aspect</b> ratio, and perimeter-to-area (PtA) relationship. The cloud size distributions exhibit a double power law with the smaller clouds having a smaller absolute exponent. The cloud orientation angles, <b>horizontal</b> <b>aspect</b> ratios, and PtA exponents are found in good agreement with earlier studies. A technique also is developed to recognize individual cells within a cloud so that statistics of cloud cellular structure can be obtained. Cell structural statistics are computed for each cloud. Unicellular clouds are generally smaller (less {{than or equal to}} 1 km) and have smaller PtA exponents, while multicellular clouds are larger (greater than or equal to 1 km) and have larger PtA exponents. Cell structural statistics {{are similar to those of}} the smaller clouds. When each cell is approximated as a quadric surface using a linear least squares fit, most cells have the shape of a hyperboloid of one sheet, but about 15 % of the cells are best modeled by a hyperboloid of two sheets. Less than 1 % of the clouds are ellipsoidal. The number of cells in a cloud increases slightly faster than linearly with increasing cloud size. The mean nearest neighbor distance between cells in a cloud, however, appears to increase linearly with increasing cloud size and to reach a maximum when the cloud effective diameter is about 10 km; then it decreases with increasing cloud size. Sensitivity studies of threshold and lapse rate show that neither has a significant impact upon the results. A goodness-of-fit ratio is used to provide a quantitative measure of the individual cloud results. Significantly improved results are obtained after applying a smoothing operator, suggesting the eliminating subresolution scale variations with higher spatial resolution may yield even better shape analyses...|$|R
40|$|Linear {{analysis}} and nonlinear numerical simulations of autocatalytic reaction fronts ascending in narrow vertically unbounded slabs describe the growth, development, and annihilation of {{fingers in the}} front, the dynamics of edge suppression, and a secondary transition to a two-roll state above the onset of convection. The pattern formation and evolution of the reaction fronts {{are determined by the}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>aspect</b> ratio Γ=b/a and the dimensionless driving parameter S=δga 3 /νDC, which involve the gap thickness a, the slab width b, the fractional density difference δ between the unreacted and reacted solutions, the gravitational acceleration g, the kinematic viscosity ν, and the catalyst molecular diffusivity DC. The reaction fronts satisfy a chemical reaction-diffusion equation and two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations describing the average Poiseuille velocity in the vertical plane perpendicular to the gap direction.
