40|$|The escape {{phenomena}} in the three-body problem with zero initial velocities and equal masses are studied both numerically and analytically. In particular, {{the effects of}} triple and binary collisions are considered in detail. Here, escape means that two particles form a binary and the third particle recedes from the binary to infinity. Collision {{is defined as the}} event when the distance between particles vanishes. First, <b>escape</b> <b>orbits</b> are searched by a numerical survey of the initial-value space and compared with collision orbits obtained by Tanikawa et al. (Cele. Mech. Dyna. Astr., 62 (1995) 335 - 362). Most escape phenomena occur after the triple encounter which is of the slingshot type. A particle passes through between the other particles which are receding from each other. It is found that <b>escape</b> <b>orbits</b> due to slingshot distribute around a particular family of binary-collision orbits which maintains nearly isosceles configuration. The configuration and the velocity vectors are almost symmetric. Moreover, if orbits approach sufficiently close to triple collision, all <b>escape</b> <b>orbits</b> distribute around the binary-collision orbits. Furthermore, <b>orbits</b> without <b>escape</b> during the first triple encounter are also found sufficiently close to the triple-collision orbit. Therefore, it becomes clear that explaining the distribution of <b>escape</b> <b>orbits</b> only by triple-collision orbits is impossible. The particular family of binary collisions has a central role in escape phenomena as well as triple collision does. Discovery of <b>escape</b> <b>orbits</b> due to exchange encounter {{is also one of the}} results. Two close approaches between two particles successively occur. The dynamical features of the slingshot and the exchange are compared with each other. Escape probabilities and increments of binding energies are evaluated statistically for the respective encounter-types. It is shown that some of slingshot encounters result in more energetic evolution than all of exchange encounters. So the restrictive and the favorable conditions of slingshot configurations leading to escape are searched for. Using the slingshot conditions, it is answered why slingshot-escape orbits distribute around the particular binary-collision orbits showing nearly symmetrical motion. Finally, it is proved analytically that both <b>escape</b> and non-escape <b>orbits</b> after the first triple encounter exist arbitrarily close to the particular triple-collision orbit. The homothetic-equilateral triple-collision orbit is considered. This orbit maintains the equilateral-triangle configuration. It is proved that in the initial-value space <b>escape</b> <b>orbits</b> distribute around three kinds of isosceles orbits where different particles <b>escape</b> and non-escape <b>orbits</b> are distributed in between. In order to show this, it is proved that the homothetic-equilateral orbit is isolated from other triple-collision orbits so far as the collision during the first triple encounter concerns. Moreover, the escape criterion is formulated in the planar isosceles problem and translated into the words of regularizing variables. The results explain the orbital structure numerically obtained in the beginning of the present thesis. With the aid of numerical integrations, it is shown that the distribution of <b>escape</b> <b>orbits</b> around another triple-collision orbit are topologically similar to the one around the homothetic-equilateral orbit. Here, it is found that the isosceles motion has an important role in determining the dynamical evolution...|$|R

This is a static spherically symmetric solution of a Horava-Lifshitz gravity model that reduces to General Relativity in the IR limit and deviates slightly from detailed balance. Taking the viewpoint that the model is essentially a (3 + 1) -dimensional modification of General Relativity we use the geodesic equation to determine the motion of massive and massless particles. We solve the geodesic equation exactly by using numerical techniques. We find that neither massless nor massive particles with non-vanishing angular momentum can reach the singularity at r= 0.

We locate the different basins of escape and we relate them withe the corresponding <b>escape</b> times of <b>orbits.</b> The SALI method is used for determining the ordered or chaotic nature of the orbits. It was observed that trapped and non-escaping orbits coexist with several escape basins. When the energy {{is very close to}} the escape energy the <b>escape</b> rate of <b>orbits</b> is huge, while as the value of the energy increases the <b>orbits</b> <b>escape</b> more quickly to infinity. Furthermore, initial conditions of orbits located near the boundaries of the basins of escape and also {{in the vicinity of the}} fractal domains were found to posses the largest escape rates.

40|$|The escape {{mechanism}} of the four hill potential is explored. A thorough numerical investigation takes place in several types of two-dimensional planes and also in a three-dimensional subspace of the entire four-dimensional phase space in order to distinguish between bounded (ordered and chaotic) and <b>escaping</b> <b>orbits.</b> The determination of {{the location of the}} basins of escape toward the different escape channels and their correlations with the corresponding escape time of the orbits is undoubtedly an issue of paramount importance. It was found that in all examined cases all initial conditions correspond to <b>escaping</b> <b>orbits,</b> while there is no numerical indication of stable bounded motion, apart from some isolated unstable periodic orbits. Furthermore, we monitor how the fractality evolves when the total orbital energy varies. The larger escape periods have been measured for orbits with initial conditions in the fractal basin boundaries, while the lowest escape rates belong to orbits with initial conditions inside the basins of escape. We hope that our numerical analysis will be useful for a further understanding of the <b>escape</b> dynamics of <b>orbits</b> in open Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom.

50|$|For {{a body in}} an {{elliptical}} orbit wishing to accelerate to an <b>escape</b> <b>orbit</b> the required speed will vary, and will be greatest at periapsis when the body is closest to the central body. However, the orbital speed of the body will also be at its highest at this point, and the change in velocity required will be at its lowest, as explained by the Oberth effect.|$|E
50|$|These effects apply {{whenever}} {{climbing to}} an orbit with higher specific orbital energy, such as during launch to low Earth orbit (LEO) or from LEO to an <b>escape</b> <b>orbit.</b> This is a worst case calculation - in practice, gravity drag during launch and ascent {{is less than}} the maximum value of gt because the launch trajectory does not remain vertical and the vehicle's mass is not constant, due to consumption of propellant and staging.|$|E

50|$|Planets {{close to}} their stars on {{circular}} orbits will tend to despin and become tidally locked. As the planet's rotation slows down the radius of a synchronous orbit of the planet moves outwards from the planet. For planets tidally locked to their stars, {{the distance from the}} planet at which the moon will be in a synchronous orbit around the planet is outside the Hill sphere of the planet. The Hill sphere of the planet is the region where its gravity dominates that of the star so it can hold on to its moons. Moons inside the synchronous orbit radius of a planet will spiral into the planet. Therefore, if the synchronous orbit is outside the Hill sphere, then all moons will spiral into the planet. If the synchronous orbit is not three-body stable then moons outside this radius will <b>escape</b> <b>orbit</b> before they reach the synchronous orbit.|$|E
50|$|In most {{situations}} it is impractical {{to achieve}} escape velocity almost instantly, {{because of the}} acceleration implied, and also because {{if there is an}} atmosphere the hypersonic speeds involved (on Earth a speed of 11.2 km/s, or 40,320 km/h) would cause most objects to burn up due to aerodynamic heating or be torn apart by atmospheric drag. For an actual <b>escape</b> <b>orbit,</b> a spacecraft will accelerate steadily out of the atmosphere until it reaches the escape velocity appropriate for its altitude (which will be less than on the surface). In many cases, the spacecraft may be first placed in a parking orbit (e.g. a low Earth orbit, LEO, at 160-2,000 km) and then accelerated to the escape velocity at that altitude, which will be slightly lower (about 11.0 km/s at a LEO of 200 km). The required additional change in speed, however, is far less because the spacecraft already has significant orbital velocity (in low Earth orbit speed is approximately 7.8 km/s, or 28,080 km/h).|$|E
50|$|Planets {{orbiting}} pulsars {{have been}} discovered, and pulsars are {{the remnants of}} the supernova explosions of high-mass stars. A planetary system that existed before the supernova would likely be mostly destroyed — planets would either evaporate, be pushed off of their orbits by the masses of gas from the exploding star, or the sudden loss of most of the mass of the central star would see them escape the gravitational hold of the star, or in some cases the supernova would kick the pulsar itself out of the system at high velocity so any planets that had survived the explosion would be left behind as free-floating objects. Planets found around pulsars may have formed as a result of pre-existing stellar companions that were almost entirely evaporated by the supernova blast, leaving behind planet-sized bodies. Alternatively, planets may form in an accretion disk of fallback matter surrounding a pulsar. Fallback disks of matter that failed to <b>escape</b> <b>orbit</b> during a supernova may also form planets around black holes.|$|E
