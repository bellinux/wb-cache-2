5|$|Tooth {{destruction}} from processes {{other than}} dental caries {{is considered a}} normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition {{is the loss of}} tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a <b>foreign</b> <b>element.</b> If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension {{on one side of the}} tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.|$|E

Homer calls their town or district [...] "Larisa" [...] and characterises it as fertile, and its inhabitants as celebrated for their spearsmanship.

In March 1923, he wrote an article applauding the 15,000 {{student movement}} participants; praising the cohesion they showed, rare for Romania, he claimed they represented [...] "a healthy and spontaneous reaction of the national preservation instinct". Addressing students from Bukovina, he called the numerus clausus something all those who wished the country well would endorse, for [...] "in our country [...] gained with so many sacrifices, we no longer have air to breathe; the invasion of the <b>foreign</b> <b>element</b> stifles us, chokes us".|$|E

40|$|Al Shabaab is {{currently}} {{one of the}} most powerful groups operating in contemporary Somalia. In control of much of southern Somalia, al Shabaab has sustained an insurgency against the internationally supported transitional government and its allies throughout the country and beyond since early 2007. In contrast to previous Somali Islamist groups, al Shabaab also actively seeks to participate in the wider Islamist movement currently sweeping the Muslim world. As such the organisation has engaged a number of <b>foreign</b> <b>elements</b> to assist with its struggle. This thesis explores the double-sided impact that these various <b>foreign</b> <b>elements</b> have had and argues that they have been a crucial factor in al Shabaab‟s relative success. Ranging from al Qaeda and other militant Islamist movements to the foreign contingent that has travelled to Somalia to fight for al Shabaab to the multitude of minor actors the organisation engages for mutual benefit, these <b>foreign</b> <b>elements</b> have noticeably enhanced al Shabaab‟s tactical and strategic capabilities. There have been some serious negative repercussions stemming from this heavy foreign influence, alienating sections of Somali society and attracting the hostile attention of the West. However, this thesis concludes that the benefits provided by al Shabaab‟s engagement with <b>foreign</b> <b>elements</b> has notably outweighed the negatives and that the organisation, despite its recent setbacks, will continue to pose a threat at least within the region...|$|R

60|$|She went towards Priscilla, {{took her}} hand, and passed her own rosy finger-tips, with a pretty, caressing movement, over the girl's hair. The touch had a magical effect.

I know not what to make of that [...] "Sergius, the Nestorian Monk," [...] whom Abu Thaleb and he are said to have lodged with; or how much any monk could have taught one still so young. Probably enough it is greatly exaggerated, this of the Nestorian Monk. Mahomet was only fourteen; had no language but his own: much in Syria must have been a strange unintelligible whirlpool to him. But the eyes of the lad were open; glimpses of many things would doubtless be taken in, and lie very enigmatic as yet, which were to ripen in a strange way into views, into beliefs and insights one day. These journeys to Syria were probably the beginning of much to Mahomet.|$|E

60|$|Daylight was waning as I returned, {{but when}} I passed the olive-grove, where many hours before I {{had heard the}} malagueña, the same {{monotonous}} song still moaned along the air, carrying back my thoughts to the swineherd.

I suppose he had never travelled further than his native town; he could neither write nor read. Madrid to him was a city where the streets were paved with silver and the King's palace was of fine gold. He was born and grew to manhood and tended his swine, and some day he would marry and beget children, and at length die and return to the Mother of all things.

The charitable and the humane, blessed with wealth, were very early penetrated by the misery of the poor student.

The man who was a blessing to his contemporaries, but who so often has been converted into a curse, by the blind adherence of his posterity to the letter, rather than to the spirit, of his wishes--I mean the [...] "pious founder"--gave money and lands, that the student, who was rich in brain and poor in all else, might be taken from the plough or from the stithy, and enabled to devote himself to the higher service of mankind; and built colleges and halls in which he might be not only housed and fed, but taught.|$|E
60|$|At Plash {{the house}} seemed to shine {{in the wet}} air--the tone of the mottled red walls and the limited but perfect lawn to {{be the work of}} an artist's brush. Lady Davenant was in the drawing-room, in a low chair by one of the windows, reading the second volume of a novel. There was the same look of crisp chintz, of fresh flowers {{wherever}} flowers could be put, of a wall-paper that was in the bad taste of years before, but had been kept so that no more money should be spent, and was almost covered over with amateurish drawings and superior engravings, framed in narrow gilt with large margins. The room had its bright, durable, sociable air, the air that Laura Wing liked in so many English things--that of being meant for daily life, for long periods, for uses of high decency. But more than ever to-day was it incongruous that such an habitation, with its chintzes and its British poets, its well-worn carpets and domestic art--the whole aspect so unmeretricious and sincere--should have to do with lives that were not right. Of course however it had to do only indirectly, and the wrong life was not old Mrs. Berrington's nor yet Lady Davenant's. If Selina and Selina's doings were not an implication of such an interior any more than it was for them an explication, this was because she had come from so far off, was a <b>foreign</b> <b>element</b> altogether.
