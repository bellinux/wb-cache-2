25|$|The Jamaican animal life, {{typical of}} the Caribbean, {{includes}} highly diversified wildlife with many endemic species found nowhere else on earth. As with other oceanic islands, land mammals are mostly bats. The only non-bat native mammal extant in Jamaica is the Jamaican hutia, locally known as the coney. Introduced mammals such as wild boar and the small Asian mongoose are also common. Jamaica {{is also home to}} about 50 species of reptiles, the largest of which is the American crocodile; however, it is only present within the Black River and a few other areas. Lizards such as anoles, iguanas and snakes such as racers and the <b>Jamaican</b> <b>boa</b> (the largest snake on the island), are common in areas such as the Cockpit Country. None of Jamaica's eight species of native snakes is venomous.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Jamaican</b> <b>boa</b> {{or yellow}} snake (Epicrates subflavus) is a nonvenomous boa species endemic to Jamaica. No {{subspecies}} are currently recognized.|$|E
50|$|The {{mountains}} {{are home to}} the world's second-largest butterfly and {{the largest in the}} Americas, the Homerus swallowtail (Papilio homerus). The Jamaican Coney (Geocapromys brownii), a type of rodent, and the <b>Jamaican</b> <b>boa</b> (Epicrates subflavus) are also found there.|$|E
50|$|The Reptile Habitat is {{the first}} {{building}} encountered heading west after exiting the tunnel under Riverside Drive and is located within the shores region. It is a fully indoor facility, containing numerous snakes, terrapins, and tortoises. The Columbus Zoo has also bred many threatened reptile species, including <b>Jamaican</b> <b>boas,</b> Madagascar ground boas, yellow-spotted river turtles, Roti Island snake-necked turtles, and eastern plains garter snakes.|$|R
40|$|Ornithologists have {{hypothesized}} that some tropical forest birds avoid snake predation by nesting in isolated trees {{that do not}} have vines and canopy contact with neighbouring trees. Here we review two complementary studies that support this hypothesis by demonstrating (1) that an abundance of vines and an interlocking canopy characterized Jamaican Black-billed Parrot Amazona agilis nest-trees that failed due to chick loss, presumably to snakes, and (2) that such trees were used preferentially by an arboreal snake congeneric to the snake implicated in the parrot losses. Evidence strongly suggested that losses of nestling Black-billed Parrots were due in substantial part to predation by the <b>Jamaican</b> (yellow) <b>Boa</b> Epicrates subflavus (Boidae). Studies of the closely related Epicrates inornatus on Puerto Rico revealed that trees used by boas had more vine cover and more crown or canopy contact with neighbouring trees than did randomly selected trees. Moreover, the boas had relatively large home ranges and were most active during March to July, which corresponds with the breeding season of parrots as well as other bird species. We suggest that nest failure due to snakes may be reduced in endangered bird species through isolating the nest-tree by eliminating vines and canopy contact with neighbouring trees and shrubs and by placing barriers on the nest-tree trunk...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Jamaican</b> <b>boa</b> {{is golden}} yellow around {{the head and}} along the {{anterior}} section of the body, with black zigzag crossbars, becoming black toward the posterior end of its body. The snake's body is quite long, up to 2 m in total length.|$|E
50|$|The park is {{globally}} {{known for}} its biodiversity. This park {{is the last of}} two known habitats of the giant swallowtail butterfly (Papilio homerus), the largest butterfly in the Western Hemisphere and also the habitat for the endangered Jamaican blackbird (Neospar nigerrimus), a refuge for the <b>Jamaican</b> <b>boa</b> (Epicrates subflavus) and the Jamaican hutia (Geocapromys brownii).|$|E
50|$|One of London Zoo's most {{well-known}} buildings, the Reptile House opened in 1927 and {{was designed by}} Joan Beauchamp Procter and Sir Edward Guy Dawber. It houses several species of reptile, including <b>Jamaican</b> <b>boa,</b> Philippine crocodiles, eastern diamondback rattlesnakes, black mambas, rhinoceros iguanas, king cobras, emerald tree boas and Yemen chameleons. In December 2012, a refurbished amphibian section was opened to the public, displaying amphibians such as African bullfrogs, axolotls, caecillians and various types of poison dart frog.|$|E
50|$|The park's reptile {{house is}} named after the famous herpetologist Mark O'Shea. He also makes {{appearances}} at the park, occasionally performing in the reptile encounters that take place outside the building, where guests {{can learn more about}} some of the park's reptiles. Reptiles in this exhibit include alligator snapping turtle, American alligator, amethystine python, beaded lizard, black rat snake, Borneo short-tailed python, Cuban crocodile, Eastern diamondback rattlesnake, Egyptian cobra, frill-necked lizard, green anaconda, green and black poison dart frog, green tree python, <b>Jamaican</b> <b>boa,</b> king cobra, malagasy giant hognose snake, Nile crocodile, red-eyed crocodile skink, red-eyed treefrog, red-tailed green ratsnake, reticulated python, saharan horned viper, and western diamondback rattlesnake.|$|E
50|$|Much of the {{remaining}} Jamaican dry forest lies within the Portland Bight Protected Area which includes the Portland Ridge and the Hellshire Hills, which are the best-studied areas of Jamaican dry forest. The endangered Jamaican iguana (Cyclura collei) is restricted to dry forests in the Hellshire Hills. The endemic tree frog Eleutherodactylus cavernicola, two endemic Thunder snakes, Trophidophis stullae and Trophidophis jamaicencis, and the endemic Blue-Tailed Galliwasp (Celestus duquesneyi) are restricted to the Portland Ridge. Other endemic species present in the area include the <b>Jamaican</b> <b>boa</b> (Epicrates subflavus), the Common Snake (Typhlops jamaicencis), the Grass Snake (Arrhyton calillaemums), the Jamaican Coney (Geocapromys brownii) and 11 endemic subspecies of birds.

40|$|The <b>Jamaican</b> <b>boa</b> (Epicrates subflavus; {{also called}} Yellow boa) is an endemic species whose natural populations greatly and {{constantly}} declined {{since the late}} 19 th century, mainly because of predation by introduced species, human persecution, and habitat destruction. In-situ conservation of the <b>Jamaican</b> <b>boa</b> is seriously hindered {{by the lack of}} information on demographic and ecological parameters as well as by a poor understanding of the population structure and species distribution in the wild. Here, using nine nuclear micro-satellite loci and a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from 87 wild-born individuals, we present the first molecular genetic analyses focusing on the diversity and structure of the natural populations of the <b>Jamaican</b> <b>boa.</b> A model-based clustering analysis of multilocus microsatellite genotypes identifies three groups that are also signif-icantly differentiated on the basis of F-statistics.

40|$|The endemic <b>Jamaican</b> <b>boa</b> (or "yellow boa", Epicrates subflavus) is a {{vulnerable}} {{species of the}} Caribbean biodiversity hotspot whose natural populations greatly declined mainly due to predation by introduced species, human persecution, and habitat destruction. A captive breeding program was initiated in 1976 and rationalized in 2002 by {{the establishment of a}} European Endangered Species Program. During the last 30 years, more than 600 offspring, of which 80 are still alive today, have been produced and distributed among European host institutions and privates. Here, using nine nuclear microsatellite loci and a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, we (i) determine the natural population from which the founders originate, (ii) identify parental allocation errors and ambiguities in the studbook, and (iii) assess the genetic diversity and estimate levels of inbreeding of the current captive population based on loss of alleles, variance in reproductive success, and relatedness among individuals. Combining measures of relatedness derived from multilocus genotypes with practical parameters such as age of animals and localization of host institutions, we propose mating groups that would maximize genetic diversity in the captive population of the <b>Jamaican</b> <b>boa.</b> Our analyses provide guidance for a more efficient breeding program that, in turn, could be used as the starting point of a repatriation program to increase the probability of the species long-term survival.

40|$|Captive snakes, that is, a <b>Jamaican</b> <b>boa</b> (Epicrates subflavus) {{a yellow}} {{anaconda}} (Eunectes notaeus) and a corn snake (Pantherophis guttatus guttatus), died with signs of bacteraemia including {{the presence of}} petechial haemorrhages in the mouth and gums and haemorrhages in the lung, spleen and intestines. The abdomen and anus were swollen with bloody-tinged mucus in the colon. Aeromonas hydrophila was recovered in dense virtually pure culture growth from the internal organs. Characterization of the isolates was by phenotyping and sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene (sequence homology of 99 % with A. hydrophila) with outputs confirming the identity as A. hydrophila. Pathogenicity experiments confirmed virulence to frogs (Rana esculenta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) ...|$|E
40|$|Evolutionary {{biology is}} not a specialty, like {{genetics}} or development - it is an explanation of what is investigated by all biological specialties. Thus, {{the goal of this}} dissertation was to study both micro- and macroevolutionary processes in a multi-disciplinary framework. Population genetics, conservation, and phylogeny inference. The <b>Jamaican</b> <b>boa</b> (Epicrates subflavus) is an endemic species, whose natural populations greatly and constantly declined since the late 19 th century, mainly due to predation by introduced species, human persecution, and habitat destruction. Using species-specific nuclear microsatellite loci and mitochondrial sequences, we investigated the population structure of this endangered reptile. All analyses pinpointed to an Eastern versus (Western+Central) pattern of differentiation in agreement with geological data and patterns of differentiation uncovered in other vertebrate and invertebrate Jamaican species. The same molecular markers were employed on 80 Jamaican boas of the European captive breeding program. This approach allowed us to (i) clarify all ambiguities in the studbook, (ii) correct parental allocation errors and (iii) assess the genetic diversity and the level of inbreeding of the current captive population. These results provide important insights for guiding the development of proper ex-situ and in-situ species survival and habitat management plans for this vulnerable snake. In the same framework of classical evolutionary genetics, we performed preliminary analyses of cytochrome b-like sequences in representatives of all cetacean families (but one), and revealed the presence of at least four nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes that were independently inserted into the nuclear genome. Evo-Devo. The emergence of Evolutionary Developmental biology has caused a partial shift in the criteria for the selection of model species. Thus far, the main criterion was the relevance of a species for understanding human biology, whereas in the frame of the new discipline, it is the understanding of the generative mechanisms underlying biological diversity that is put forward. We discussed a few criteria and limitations of major relevance to the choice of model species for Evo-Devo studies, and applied a pragmatic approach to identify possible model species within Amniotes. Moreover, we developed MANTiS, an application pipeline that aims at integrating genomic, functional and expression data with evolutionary concepts, thus constituting the missing link between multi-species genome comparisons and functional analyses. Using MANTiS, we proceeded in the analysis of 35 metazoan full genomes for identifying all lineage-specific gene gains and losses. These results were combined with functional and expression analyses, and we demonstrated the much higher performance of MANTiS against popular databases of ortholog clusters (InParanoid, OrthoMCL, RoundUp). Finally, preliminary results of our attempt to adapt the new revolutionary technology of DNA sequencing in microfabricated high-density picoliter reactors (developed by 454 /Roche) to the ultra-fast sequencing of brain full transcriptomes in multiple reptilian species are highly promising. As an example, the Crocodylus sample generated more than 72 Mbases (per run), which were successfully assembled in approximately 31, 000 contigs. One third of the latter could be matched to known sequences in the transcriptome of related species. After fine-tuning of the in silico analyses, and incorporation of genomic sequence data, we expect our approach to provide important insights not only in the evolution of central nervous system novelties in vertebrates, but in transcriptomes in general as the brain transcriptome {{is one of the most}} complex among all organs.
