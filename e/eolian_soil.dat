40|$|The CheMin {{instrument}} on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity uses a Co tube {{source and}} a CCD detector to acquire mineralogy from diffracted primary X-rays and chemical information from fluoresced X-rays. CheMin {{has been operating}} at the MSL Gale Crater field site since August 5, 2012 and has provided the first X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses in situ on a body beyond Earth. Data from the first sample collected, the Rocknest <b>eolian</b> <b>soil,</b> identify a basaltic mineral suite, predominantly plagioclase (approx. An 50), forsteritic olivine (approx. Fo 58), augite and pigeonite, consistent with expectation that detrital grains on Mars would reflect widespread basaltic sources. Minor phases (each < 2 wt% of the crystalline component) include sanidine, magnetite, quartz, anhydrite, hematite and ilmenite. Significantly, {{about a third of}} the sample is amorphous or poorly ordered in XRD. This amorphous component is attested to by a broad rise in background centered at approx. 27 deg 2 (theta) (Co K(alpha)) and may include volcanic glass, impact glass, and poorly crystalline phases including iron oxyhydroxides; a rise at lower 2 (theta) may indicate allophane or hisingerite. Constraints from phase chemistry of the crystalline components, compared with a Rocknest bulk composition from the APXS instrument on Curiosity, indicate that in sum the amorphous or poorly crystalline components are relatively Si, Al, Mg-poor and enriched in Ti, Cr, Fe, K, P, S, and Cl. All of the identified crystalline phases are volatile-free; H 2 O, SO 2 and CO 2 volatile releases from a split of this sample analyzed by the SAM instrument on Curiosity are associated with the amorphous or poorly ordered materials. The Rocknest <b>eolian</b> <b>soil</b> may be a mixture of local detritus, mostly crystalline, with a regional or global set of dominantly amorphous or poorly ordered components. The Rocknest sample was targeted by MSL for "first time analysis" to demonstrate that a loose deposit could be scooped, sieved to < 150 microns, and delivered to instruments in the body of the rover. A drilled sample of sediment in outcrop is anticipated. At the time of writing this abstract, promising outcrops are in range and this talk will provide an update on data collected with the CheMin instrument...|$|E
40|$|The {{exploitation}} of resources {{and an increase in}} civil engineering projects in the Junggar Basin has caused major environmental disturbance to the fragile desert eco-system. It is a serious problem that attracts global attention on how to restore and reconstruct the stable natural eco-system. Understanding soil moisture content and lateral water movement in and areas, at a shallow depth, is of practical importance. On the one hand, lateral flow can be expected to reduce the groundwater recharge rate. On the other hand, it may result in a strong variability of water resources over short distances, thus affecting the distribution and composition of the vegetal cover. The <b>eolian</b> <b>soil</b> moisture condition is the primary factor that affects desert plant-cover in the hinter land of Junggar Basin, especially in spring (from March to May). With neutron probe, through field calibration, the soil moisture changes in different terrain parts, which are the crest, slope, the foot of the natural and disturbed dunes and the interdune land were measured. The data shows that the spatial distribution of the soil moisture in spring is closely related to the sun radiation, the depth of snow in winter, landscape position, the depth of soil, plant cover condition (cover-degree, plant species), and human impact. The data also provides scientific information and instruction for restoring and reconstructing the eco-system that has been damaged by engineering disturbance...|$|E
40|$|Microtopographic {{profiles}} {{were measured}} and power spectra calculated for dated lava flow surfaces at Cima volcanic {{field in the}} eastern Mojave Desert of California in order to quantify changes in centimeter- to meter-scale roughness {{as a function of}} age. For lava flows younger than about 0. 8 m. y., roughness over all spatial scales decreases with age, with meter-scale roughness decreasing slightly more than centimeter scales. Flows older than about 0. 8 m. y. show a reversal of this trend, becoming as rough as young flows at these scales. Modeling indicates that eolian deposition can explain most of the change observed in the offset, or roughness amplitude, of power spectra of flow surface profiles up to 0. 8 m. y. Other processes, such as rubbing and stone pavement development, appear to have a minor effect in this age range. Changes in power spectra of surfaces older than about 0. 8 m. y. are consistent with roughening due to fluvial dissection. These results agree qualitatively with a process-response model that attributes systematic changes in flow surface morphology to cyclic changes in the rates of <b>eolian,</b> <b>soil</b> formation, and fluvial processes. Identification of active surficial processes and estimation of the extent of their effects, or stage of surficial evolution, through measurement of surface roughness will help put the correlation of surficial units on a quantitative basis. This may form the basis for the use of radar remote sensing data to help in regional correlations of surficial units...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Substantial {{portions}} of the emissions inventory within forested lands are from dispersed intermittent sources. Chief sources are smoke from wildfire and prescribed fire, emissions associated with concentrated recreation and second-home developments, and fugitive dust from unpaved roads and <b>eolian</b> <b>soils.</b> Effects of smoke on flora range from reduced photosynthetic efficiency at low dosages to tissue necrosis at high dosages. Effects on fauna are not clearly defined. Effect of smoke on social values, primarily visibility, is recognized but not understood. Dispersion process in complex terrain, the physiographic setting for most forested lands, is complicated by topography and spatially varying wind fields, {{a higher degree of}} anisotropy of turbulence, and a wider range of turbulence intensities than found over level ground...|$|R
40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 266 A recent morphological and hydrogeological {{description of}} the Doñana areas {{can be found in}} Custodio et al. (2009). It is the largest seminatural area of Western Europe and holds a 3000 km 2 aquifer system. The territory was unhabited due to the very poor <b>eolian</b> sand <b>soil</b> cover, the marshes and a large number of lagoons and wetlands. There is a very long, almost untouched coastal area only developed for shell–fish capturing, except for two recent, localized, large tourist resorts. The area was promoted for irrigated agriculture in the 1970 s using local deep groundwater from a coarse layer below thick fluvio–marine sand formations. It also holds a large protected area as national and natural parks. Groundwater studies are available since the late 1960 s and especially from the late 1970 s.

40|$|Background [...] Biogeochemical {{investigations}} of As transport and uptake by vegetation are being conducted over a metamorphic and intrusive terrane of the Fortymile River watershed of eastern Alaska. The occurrence of As in <b>eolian</b> sub-arctic <b>soils</b> is examined, {{as well as}} its relative bioconcentration in willow and alder. This information is used by land managers to assess the importance of geogenic vs. anthropogenic metal sources of environmentally important trace elements in multi-use areas where mining, recreation, and ecosystem preservation are important land-use options (Wanty and others, 2000). Study sites were located on Paleozoic (?) metamorphosed plutonic (supracrustal) metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks (and associated marble units), and the younger (Jurassic) monzodioritic and tonalitic rocks (Day and others, 2000; Gamble and others, 2001). Samples of A, B, and C soil horizons (Cryaquepts/Cryochrepts), willow (Salix glauca) and alder (Alnus crispa) leaf and twig tissue, and feather moss (Hylocomium splendens) were collected at 36 sites within {{the lower part of the}} main-stem of the Fortymile River (~ 600 km 2 area; fig. 1). The relative contribution to this ecosystem of As from five major rock units was ascertained by the evaluation or rock and soil chemistry and by element uptake by plants...|$|R
40|$|The soil carbon {{reservoir}} {{is the largest}} {{carbon reservoir}} in terrestrial ecosystems and consists of soil organic and inorganic carbon stocks. Previous studies have mainly focused on the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, and limited information is available about the soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stock. The Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), which {{is located in the}} arid and semi-arid region of China, is an important inorganic carbon reservoir, with a thick soil layer that is rich in calcium carbonate. However, there are few reports on the SIC stock and its spatial distribution in this region. In the current study, the SIC densities and stocks for various soil types and land use patterns were evaluated based on 495 profiles with 2470 soil samples across the CLP, which were collected from the Chinese Second National Soil Survey. The results showed that in the top 1 m of soil across the CLP, the average SIC density is 17. 04 kg/m(2), and the total SIC stock is approximately 10. 20 Pg C (1 Pg = 10 (15) g). The SIC stock of the CLP accounts for approximately 18. 4 % of the total SIC stock throughout China. The average values of the SIC stock in the 0 - 20, 20 - 50 and 50 - 100 cm depths of the CLP are 2. 39, 2. 92 and 4. 89 Pg, respectively. Under different land use patterns, the order of the average SIC density is farmland approximate to grassland > forest in all soil layers. For the various soil types, the SIC density in the 0 - 100 cm layer is the highest in alkaline soil and lowest in subalpine meadow soil, whereas the SIC stock is highest in loessial <b>soil,</b> <b>eolian</b> sandy <b>soil</b> and sierozem, and the lowest in subalpine meadow soil. These differences are largely a result of the area occupied by each soil type and the climate conditions. The results of this study provide basic information about carbon reservoir in China and contribute {{to our understanding of the}} SIC stock on the CLP as it relates to the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{contribution}} is to present a theoretical approach and two experimental campaigns (on wind tunnel and on the track) concerning the research work about the ballast train-induced-wind erosion (BTIWE) phenomenon. When a high speed train overpasses the critical speed, it produces a wind speed close to the track large enough to start {{the motion of the}} ballast elements, eventually leading to the rolling of the stones (Kwon and Park, 2006) and, if these stones get enough energy, they can jump and then initiate a saltation-like chain reaction, as found in the saltation processes of <b>soil</b> <b>eolian</b> erosion (Bagnold, 1941). The expelled stones can reach a height which is larger than the lowest parts of the train, striking them (and the track surroundings) producing considerable damage that should be avoided. There is not much published work about this phenomenon, in spite of the great interest that exists due to its relevant applications in increasing the maximum operative train speed. Particularly, the initiation of flight of ballast due to the pass of a high speed train has been studied by Kwon and Park (2006) by performing field and wind tunnel experiments...|$|R
40|$|Clouds and {{aerosols}} have a large, yet highly uncertain, {{effect on}} changes in Earth’s climate. A factor of particular note is {{the role played by}} ice-nucleating particles, which remains poorly understood. The mineral K-feldspar (Kfs) has recently been shown by a number of independent studies to nucleate ice in mixed-phase cloud conditions far more efficiently than other common minerals. Here, global atmospheric Kfs flux through geologic time is estimated; constrained by records of secular continental crust and biosphere evolution, plate tectonics, volcanism, glaciation, and attendant trends in land surface stability. The analysis reveals that Kfs flux today is at neither extreme of the range estimated across geological time. The present-day Kfs flux, however, is likely to be among the most spatially and temporally variable due to land surface change. The concept of an ice-nucleation efficiency factor that can be calculated from rocks, and also <b>eolian</b> sediments and <b>soils,</b> is proposed. This allows the impact of paleo-atmospheric dust to be estimated through the rock record alongside meteorological and atmospheric composition considerations. With the reasonable assumption that the ice-nucleating properties of Kfs are themselves independent of the background climate state, a better understanding of Kfs flux across a range of spatial and temporal scales will advance understanding of climate processes and interactions...|$|R
40|$|Surface horizons of many alpine soils on Quaternary {{deposits}} in high-mountain settings are enriched in silt. The origin of these particles has been debated, {{particularly in the}} Rocky Mountain region of North America. The most common explanations are frost shattering of coarser particles and eolian additions from distant sources. We studied soil A horizons on alpine moraines of late-glacial (Satanta Peak) age in the Colorado Front Range. Surface horizons of soils on these moraines are enriched in silt and have a particle size distribution that resembles loess and dust deposits found elsewhere. The compositions of sand and silt fractions of the soils were compared to possible local source rocks, using immobile trace elements Ti, Nb, Zr, Ce, and Y. The sand fractions of soils have {{a wide range of}} trace element ratios, similar to the range of values in the local biotite gneiss bedrock. In contrast, silt fractions have narrower ranges of trace element ratios that do not overlap the range of these ratios in biotite gneiss. The particle size and geochemical results support an interpretation that silts in these soils are derived from airborne dust. Eolian silts were most likely derived from distant sources, such as the semiarid North Park and Middle Park basins to the west. We hypothesize that much of the <b>eolian</b> influx to <b>soils</b> of the Front Range occurred during an early to mid-Holocene warm period, when sediment availability in semiarid source basins was at a maximum...|$|R
40|$|Although loess–paleosol {{sequences}} {{are among}} the most important records of Quaternary climate change and past dust deposition cycles, few modern examples of such sedimentation systems have been studied. Stratigraphic studies and 22 new accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon ages from the Matanuska Valley in southern Alaska show that loess deposition there began sometime after 6500 14 C yr B. P. and has continued to the present. The silts are produced through grinding by the Matanuska and Knik glaciers, deposited as outwash, entrained by strong winds, and redeposited as loess. Over a downwind distance of 40 km, loess thickness, sand content, and sand-pluscoarse- silt content decrease, whereas fine-silt content increases. Loess deposition was episodic, as shown by the presence of paleosols, at distances 3 ̆e 10 km from the outwash plain loess source. Stratigraphic complexity is at a maximum (i. e., the greatest number of loesses and paleosols) at intermediate (10 – 25 km) distances from the loess source. Surface soils increase in degree of development with distance downwind from the source, where sedimentation rates are lower. Proximal soils are Entisols or Inceptisols, whereas distal soils are Spodosols. Ratios of mobile CaO, K 2 O, and Fe 2 O 3 to immobile TiO 2 show decreases in surface horizons with distance from the source. Thus, as in China, where loess deposition also takes place today, <b>eolian</b> sedimentation and <b>soil</b> formation are competing processes. Study of loess and paleosols in southern Alaska shows that particle size can vary over short distances, loess deposition can be episodic over limited time intervals, and soils developed in stabilized loess can show considerable variability under the same vegetation...|$|R
40|$|In mid-February 2006, windstorms in Arizona, Utah, {{and western}} Colorado {{generated}} a dust cloud that distributed {{a layer of}} dust {{across the surface of}} the snowpack throughout much of the Colorado Rockies; it remained visible throughout the winter. We compared the chemical composition of snowfall and snowpack collected during and after the dust deposition event with pre-event snow at 17 sites extending from central Colorado into southern Wyoming. The chemistry of dust-event snowfall and the post-event snowpack were compared to long-term wetfall precipitation and snowpack chemistry at the Fraser Experimental Forest (FEF). The pH of the snowpack formed during the dust event was 1. 5 units higher, calcium was 10 -fold higher, and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) was 100 -fold higher than levels measured in either early or late-season snow. Elevated ANC was attributable to dust-derived increase in carbonate/bicarbonate ions, likely from soluble calcium carbonate inclusions in dust material. The single dust event contributed carbonate/bicarbonate-derived ANC equivalent to the sum of strong acids deposited during the entire winter at FEF. Effects appeared more pronounced at upper elevations and in the sparse forest near treeline, compared to densely forested lower elevation sites. Monthly snowpack solute analysis at FEF has not documented an event of similar magnitude during its 17 -year period of record. The solute composition of post-event snow is similar to average Fraser streamwater, however. To assess the effect of dust on the timing and composition of water exported from high-elevation ecosystems, future work should consider both the contributions of <b>eolian</b> deposition on <b>soil</b> development, plant communities, and nutrient and water relations plus the impact of individual deposition events on snowpack chemistry and duration...|$|R
40|$|In {{temperate}} regions, eolian {{deposits of}} different natures are often pedogenically-altered and mixed with underlying sediments. The research {{reported in this}} paper identifies {{for the first time}} the presence of <b>eolian</b> deposits in <b>soils</b> of central Tuscany and investigates the characteristics and origin. Five relict, polycyclic paleosol profiles were studied. P 1 was situated in a natural dust trap, a doline on top of an isolated limestone hill; P 2 and P 3 were both situated on a limestone plateau, and P 4 and P 5 on a mid- and foot slope on schist. The profiles were sampled for routine analyses, iron forms, heavy minerals, major and trace elements, and pollen, spores and non-pollen palynomorphs. Undisturbed samples were taken for micromorphological and SEM analyses. Nine soil horizons were sampled for OSL dating. Eolian deposits were dominant or abundant in the first layers of P 1, P 2 and P 3. OSL age determinations of soil horizons deriving from eolian parent material were middle Holocene. Chemical and heavy mineral analyses indicated different possible sources, including bare slopes, alluvial fans and wide channels, coming from the nearby streams that drain the Middle Tuscany ridge and the Mounts of Chianti; marginal contribution of volcanic ashes was only found in P 1. The research demonstrated that wind soil erosion accompanied water erosion and colluvial deposition during the middle Holocene in the Elsa River basin. Pollen spectra, in particular, indicated that soil degradation occurred in an environment showing signs of incipient desertification, resulting from an increase of aridity in a land already strongly influenced by humans. Although central Italy is currently considered to be only marginally affected by wind soil erosion, a climate change, which would imply increased arid conditions, could trigger a new cycle of slope denudation, wind erosion and loess deposition...|$|R
40|$|In {{drylands}} {{of southeastern}} Utah, USA, the invasive exotic grass Bromus tectorum L. occurs in distinct spatial patterns suggesting soil control of ecosystem susceptibility to invasion. To improve {{our understanding of}} these patterns, we examined performance of B. tectorum in relation to additions of water, KCl, MgO, and CaO at seventeen 1600 m(2) sites distributed across a calcareous soil gradient in Canyonlands National Park. Water additions resulted in a 57 % increase in B. tectorum establishment. Fall establishment was significantly correlated with silt and clay content in wet plots but not in dry plots, suggesting that texture effects on B. tectorum establishment patterns may be greater in wet years than in dry years. Applications of MgO resulted in a 49 % decrease in B. tectorum establishment, although MgO {{had no effect on}} whole-plot biomass {{at the end of the}} growing season. B. tectorum-soil relations were strongest during winter (December-March) when relative growth rates were negatively related to soil acid-neutralizing potential, sand and CaCO 3 content, and a measure of bioavailable Mg; and positively related to silt and clay content, total N, measures of bioavailable Mn, P, and K, and a measure of magnetite indicating distributional patterns of <b>eolian</b> dust. As <b>soils</b> were persistently moist during this period, we attribute strong B. tectorum-soil patterns in winter to effects of low temperature on diffusion, microbial activity, and/or production of root exudates important for nutrient mobilization and uptake. In spring, there was a reversal in B. tectorum-soil relations such that loamy soils with higher B. tectorum densities were unfavorable for growth relative to sandy soils with higher warm-season water potentials. We conclude that resource limitations for B. tectorum in this study area shift seasonally, from water limitation of fall establishment, to nutrient limitation of winter growth, and back to water limitation of spring growth. Because study sites generally were arrayed along a hillslope gradient with downslope trends in soil vtexture and nutrient content, close B. tectorum-soil relations documented in this study indicate that a geomorphic framework is useful for understanding and predicting B. tectorum invasion patterns in dryland ecosystems of this region...|$|R
