Ten years after the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998 (GNHIES 98), the population survey DEGS 1 is one of the data sources {{that can be used for}} monitoring vaccination coverage. In the survey, data on vaccination history were obtained from vaccination cards and self-reports. The prevalence of immunisation for tetanus and diphtheria was higher compared to the prevalence estimated 10 years previously in GNHIES 98.

However, some developing countries fail to achieve desirable vaccination coverage; Afghanistan is one such country. The present study was performed to evaluate the progress and variation in infant <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> by district and region in Afghanistan and {{to assess the impact}} of conflict and resource availability on <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage.</b> Results This study analysed reports of infant immunisation from 331 districts across 7 regions of Afghanistan between 2000 and 2003. Geographic information system (GIS) analysis was used to visualise the distribution of <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> in districts and to identify geographic inequalities in the process of improvement of infant <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage.</b> The number of districts reporting <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> increased substantially during the four years of the study. Progress in Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> was observed in all 7 regions, although satisfactory coverage of 80 % remained unequally distributed. Progress in the third dose of Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus (DPT 3) immunisation differed among regions, in addition to the unequal distribution of <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> in 2000.

40|$|Background Candidate human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) vaccines have demonstrated almost 90 %- 100 % efficacy in preventing persistent, type-specific HPV infection over 18 mo in clinical trials. If these vaccines {{go on to}} demonstrate prevention of precancerous lesions in phase III clinical trials, they will be licensed for public use in the near future. How these vaccines {{will be used in}} countries with national cervical cancer screening programmes is an important question. Methods and Findings We developed a transmission model of HPV 16 infection and progression to cervical cancer and calibrated it to Finnish HPV 16 seroprevalence over time. The model was used to estimate the transmission probability of the virus, to look at the effect of changes in patterns of sexual behaviour and smoking on age-specific trends in cancer incidence, and to explore the impact of HPV 16 vaccination. We estimated a high per-partnership transmission probability of HPV 16, of 0. 6. The modelling analyses showed that changes in sexual behaviour and smoking accounted, in part, for the increase seen in cervical cancer incidence in 35 - to 39 -y-old women from 1990 to 1999. At both low (10 % in opportunistic immunisation) and high (90 % in a national <b>immunisation</b> programme) <b>coverage</b> of the adolescent population, vaccinating women and men had little benefit over vaccinating women alone. We estimate that vaccinating 90 % of young women before sexual debut has the potential to decrease HPV type-specific (e. g., type 16) cervical cancer incidence by 91 %. If older {{women are more likely to}} have persistent infections and progress to cancer, then vaccination with a duration of protection of less than 15 y could result in an older susceptible cohort and no decrease in cancer incidence. While vaccination has the potential to significantly reduce type-specific cancer incidence, its combination with screening further improves cancer prevention. Conclusions HPV vaccination has the potential to significantly decrease HPV type-specific cervical cancer incidence. High vaccine coverage of women alone, sustained over many decades, with a long duration of vaccine-conferred protection, would have the greatest impact on type-specific cancer incidence. This level of coverage could be achieved through national coordinated programmes, with surveillance to detect cancers caused by nonvaccine oncogenic HPV types. Public Library of Scienc...|$|R

Bivariate, multivariate, and dropout rates are used to understand the dif ferentials and changes in <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage.</b> The result reveals substantial improvement in partial immunisation in most states; however, the increase in full <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> has been slower. Two crucial determinants of the full <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> in selected states are availability of health card and antenatal care (ANC) visits of mother.

Aboriginal Immunisation Officers were employed in Hunter New England Local Health District (HNELHD), New South Wales (NSW), Australia, to telephone the families of all Aboriginal infants prior to the due date for their first scheduled vaccination. Methods Aboriginal Immunisation Officers contacted the families of Aboriginal children born in the Hunter New England Local Health District (HNELHD) by telephone before their due immunisation date (pre-call) to provide the rationale for timely immunisation, and to facilitate contact with culturally safe local immunisation services if this was required. The impact of this strategy on <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> rates is reviewed.

DESIGN: Three annual lameness surveys in children aged 0 - 60 months employing cluster sampling methods {{and a series of}} five cross sectional surveys of <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> in children aged 12 - 23 months of age were undertaken. SETTING: Pondicherry, India, 1988 - 92. SUBJECTS: More than 10, 000 children in the age group of 0 - 60 months took part in the three annual lameness surveys and samples of 210 children aged 12 - 23 months were covered each year in <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> surveys. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Altogether 50 of 11, 461, 24 of 10, 093, and 17 of 11, 218 children surveyed during 1989, 1990, and 1991 respectively had become lame as a result of poliomyelitis, giving prevalences of 4. 4, 2. 4, and 1. 5 per 1000 children for the three surveys. The corrected prevalences of poliomyelitis were 5. 9, 3. 2, and 2. 0 per 1000 children during 1989, 1990, and 1991 respectively. The proportion of cases aged up to 36 months fell from 48 % in 1989 to 12. 5 % in 1990 and 6 % in 1991. The age at onset was less than 1 year in most. The median age at onset was 10. 7 months.

Identification of factors that might modulate coverage could inform effective immunisation programmes and policies. We constructed a performance indicator that could quantitatively approximate measures of the susceptibility of immunisation programmes to coverage losses, with an aim to identify correlations between trends in vaccine coverage and socioeconomic factors. Methods: We undertook a data-driven time-series analysis to examine trends in coverage of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccination across 190 countries over the past 30 years. We grouped countries into six world regions according to WHO classifications. We used Gaussian process regression to forecast future coverage rates and provide a vaccine performance index: a summary measure {{of the strength of}} <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> in a country. Findings: Overall vaccine coverage increased in all six world regions between 1980 and 2010, with variation in volatility and trends. Our vaccine performance index identified that 53 countries had more than a 50 % chance of missing the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) target of 90 % worldwide coverage with three doses of DTP (DTP 3) by 2015. These countries were mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, but Austria and Ukraine also featured. Factors associated with DTP 3 <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> varied by world region: personal income (Spearman's ρ= 0 · 66, p= 0 · 0011) and government health spending (0 · 66, p< 0 · 0001) were informative of <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> in the Eastern Mediterranean between 1980 and 2010, whereas primary school completion was informative of coverage in Africa (0 · 56, p< 0 · 0001) over the same period. The proportion of births attended by skilled health staff correlated significantly with <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> across many world regions.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundImmunisation {{programmes}} {{have made}} substantial contributions to lowering {{the burden of}} disease in children, {{but there is a}} growing need to ensure that programmes are equity-oriented. We aimed to provide a detailed update about the state of between-country inequality and within-country economic-related inequality in the delivery of three doses of the combined diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, and pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP 3), with a special focus on inequalities in high-priority countries. MethodsWe used data from the latest available Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys done in 51 low-income and middle-income countries. Data for DTP 3 coverage were disaggregated by wealth quintile, and inequality was calculated as difference and ratio measures based on coverage in richest (quintile 5) and poorest (quintile 1) household wealth quintiles. Excess change was calculated for 21 countries with data available at two timepoints spanning a 10 year period. Further analyses were done for six high-priority countries—ie, those with low national <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> and/or high absolute numbers of unvaccinated children. Significance was determined using 95 % CIs. FindingsNational DTP 3 <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> across the 51 study countries ranged from 32 % in Central African Republic to 98 % in Jordan. Within countries, the gap in DTP 3 <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> suggested pro-rich inequality, with a difference of 20 percentage points or more between quintiles 1 and 5 for 20 of 51 countries. In Nigeria, Pakistan, Laos, Cameroon, and Central African Republic, the difference between quintiles 1 and 5 exceeded 40 percentage points. In 15 of 21 study countries, an increase over time in national coverage of DTP 3 immunisation was realised alongside faster improvements in the poorest quintile than the richest. For example, in Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Gabon, Mali, and Nepal, the absolute increase in coverage was at least 2 · 0 percentage points per year, with faster improvement in the poorest quintile. Substantial economic-related inequality in DTP 3 <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> was reported in five high-priority study countries (DR Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan), but not Uganda. InterpretationOverall, within-country inequalities in DTP 3 immunisation persist, but seem to have narrowed over the past 10 years.

The aim of immunisation is {{to prevent the spread of}} disease, but <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> rates do not show if the spread of disease has been controlled. Furthermore, coverage only shows the number of people that have been immunised for a particular vaccine. However, the concept of herd immunity (the more people vaccinated, the harder it is for a disease to spread through non-vaccinated individuals in an environment) is used in vaccine programmes to prevent and eventually eradicate the spread of infectious disease. This paper proposes the use of geovisualisation to highlight these uncertainties. A NIR geovisualisation tool portraying uncertainties in <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> rates and herd immunity for disease has the potential to be a powerful policy making tool...|$|E
40|$|<b>Immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> is {{calculated}} from Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR) data using the ‘third dose assumption’. This assumes {{that if the}} third {{in a series of}} vaccine doses has been recorded on the ACIR, the previous two doses have been received, {{whether or not they are}} recorded. The objectives of this study were to validate the ‘third dose assumption’, and measure the impact of the assumption on <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> estimates at 12 months of age. A sample of children born in 1999 and assessed as fully immunised at 12 months of age by applying the ‘third dose assumption ’ were selected from the ACIR. Parents were interviewed by telephone to obtain information about vaccinations not recorded on the ACIR. Based on the survey results, the impact of the ‘third-dose assumption ’ on national coverage estimates at 12 months of age was estimated. Of 219 surveyed children assessed as up-to-date at 12 months of age only by applying the ‘third dose assumption’, 212 (96. 8 %) met study criteria of ‘definite ’ immunisation for all unrecorded first and second vaccine doses. Of the remaining seven, six believed all doses had been received, while one confirmed that one dose had been missed. The ‘third dose assumption ’ overestimated coverage by 0. 2 per cent, based on criteria for ‘definite ’ immunisation. If the assumption were not used, <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> at 12 months of age in Australia would have been underestimated by 7 per cent. The ‘third dose assumption ’ is valid and important to use in calculating <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> from the ACIR. Although ACIR reporting and coverage levels continue to improve, under-reporting of vaccine doses due at two and four months of age persists. The ‘third dose assumption ’ may be applicable to comparable immunisation registries in other countries...|$|E
40|$|Using {{findings}} from a random, computer assisted telephone survey of households, this paper examines influenza and pneumococcal <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> and predictors of immunisation in 2203 adults with asthma, diabetes or a cardiovascular condition living in Queensland, Australia. 47 % and 31 % of high-risk persons were immunised against influenza and pnemococcus respectively. <b>Immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> varied across chronic conditions and increased with age, being significantly higher for those aged 65 {{years and older}} and consequently eligible for free vaccination. Poor self reported health status was an independent predictor of pneumococcal vaccination status for people with asthma, diabetes or a cardiovascular condition; however it was only an independent predictor of influenza immunisation status for people with diabetes. Extending free vaccination to all people at risk may increase immunisation rates for younger people with a chronic conditio...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect on}} <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> of {{applying}} guiding principles {{to the management}} of primary health care services in a province in Papua New Guinea is described. These principles were: (a) Each health centre should have a defined geographical area of responsibility. (b) Each health centre should be responsible for a defined population. (c) Each health centre should have defined target groups for immunisation and child health clinic enrolment. (d) An accurate and meaningful reporting system is essential. (e) Each health centre should receive regular feedback on its achievements. <b>Immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> in the province, as judged by the proportion of children under 1 year of age receiving their second dose of triple antigen, improved from 57 - 67 % in 1980 - 2 to 89 - 94 % in 1983 - 4...|$|E
40|$|Background: Immunisation {{programmes}} {{have made}} substantial contributions to lowering {{the burden of}} disease in children, {{but there is a}} growing need to ensure that programmes are equity-oriented. We aimed to provide a detailed update about the state of between-country inequality and within-country economic-related inequality in the delivery of three doses of the combined diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, and pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP 3), with a special focus on inequalities in high-priority countries. Methods: We used data from the latest available Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys done in 51 low-income and middle-income countries. Data for DTP 3 coverage were disaggregated by wealth quintile, and inequality was calculated as difference and ratio measures based on coverage in richest (quintile 5) and poorest (quintile 1) household wealth quintiles. Excess change was calculated for 21 countries with data available at two timepoints spanning a 10 year period. Further analyses were done for six high-priority countries—ie, those with low national <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> and/or high absolute numbers of unvaccinated children. Significance was determined using 95 % CIs. Findings: National DTP 3 <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> across the 51 study countries ranged from 32 % in Central African Republic to 98 % in Jordan. Within countries, the gap in DTP 3 <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> suggested pro-rich inequality, with a difference of 20 percentage points or more between quintiles 1 and 5 for 20 of 51 countries. In Nigeria, Pakistan, Laos, Cameroon, and Central African Republic, the difference between quintiles 1 and 5 exceeded 40 percentage points. In 15 of 21 study countries, an increase over time in national coverage of DTP 3 immunisation was realised alongside faster improvements in the poorest quintile than the richest. For example, in Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Gabon, Mali, and Nepal, the absolute increase in coverage was at least 2 · 0 percentage points per year, with faster improvement in the poorest quintile. Substantial economic-related inequality in DTP 3 <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> was reported in five high-priority study countries (DR Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan), but not Uganda. Interpretation: Overall, within-country inequalities in DTP 3 immunisation persist, but seem to have narrowed over the past 10 years. Monitoring economic-related inequalities in <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> is warranted to reveal where gaps exist and inform appropriate approaches to reach disadvantaged populations. Funding: None...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate if the mothers ’ demographics and household char-acteristics—including type of use of cooking fuel, energy and toilet facilities—have any im-plication for complete immunisation rates among their children. A cross-sectional data analysis of a nationally representative sample of 4925 women with at least one child was performed. Chi-squared tests and multivariate logistic re-gression analyses were used. <b>Immunisation</b> <b>coverage</b> was positively associated with the mother’s education and with household char-acteristics such as toilet facility, electricity and involvement in a microfinance group. These findings indicate the need for further advocacy for increased knowledge on the importance of vaccination and affordable public immunisation programs focusing on higher risk households such as those with pit facilities, lack of electric-ity and no participation in a microfinance group. Such households warrant further attention and can be targeted for <b>immunisation</b> <b>coverage...</b>|$|E
