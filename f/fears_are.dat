5|$|The {{following}} day, at the beach, Brody sees a {{dark shadow}} that approaches the swimmers. Thinking it is a shark, he frantically orders everyone {{out of the}} water, and causes a panic by firing his gun. However, the shadow is revealed to be a school of bluefish. His <b>fears</b> <b>are</b> confirmed when he acquires a close-up picture of the shark from the diver's camera. The Amity town council, including local developer Len Peterson, deny the evidence and fire Brody.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder becomes obsessed {{with a number of}} children who have vanished while investigating the bizarre disappearance of a young girl from her home. In the meanwhile, Scully fears that he is emotionally involved due to his sister's disappearance 27 years earlier. Her <b>fears</b> <b>are</b> heightened when Mulder's mother dies, apparently of suicide.|$|E
5|$|The Incredible Hulk is a 2008 American superhero film {{based on}} the Marvel Comics {{character}} the Hulk, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Universal Pictures. It is the second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Louis Leterrier, with a screenplay by Zak Penn. It stars Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, Tim Blake Nelson, Ty Burrell, and William Hurt. In The Incredible Hulk, a new backstory is established where Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk as an unwitting pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate the supersoldier program through gamma radiation. On the run, he attempts to cure himself of the Hulk before he is captured by General Thaddeus Ross, but his worst <b>fears</b> <b>are</b> realized when power-hungry soldier Emil Blonsky becomes a similar, but more bestial creature.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s {{the defence}} of Oxleas Wood {{to the north}} east of the town became a focus for a pan-European {{campaign}} to resist high capacity urban roads.

25|$|When Mabelle Sainsbury Seale goes missing, Poirot's <b>fears</b> <b>are</b> realised. A {{search for}} her is conducted, and some time later her body is {{apparently}} found in a sealed chest in the apartment of Mrs. Albert Chapman, who has herself disappeared. The face of the corpse has been smashed in, and Poirot notices the dead woman's dull buckled shoes. He is sceptical of the theory that Mrs Chapman has killed Sainsbury Seale and fled. Sure enough, once the dental records are produced, it is discovered that the corpse is that of Mrs Chapman. Poirot is now drawn {{into the life of}} the Blunt family. An attempt is made on Blunt's life; Raikes happens to be a bystander. Poirot is invited down to Blunt's house, where he is persuaded to undertake a search for Sainsbury Seale. While he is there, a second attempt is made on Blunt's life, but it is seemingly thwarted by Raikes. The pistol used in the attack is found in the hand of none other than Frank Carter, who has taken a job as gardener at the house under a false identity.|$|E

25|$|On August 4, 2010, Walker {{announced}} his ruling {{in favor of}} the plaintiffs, overturning Proposition 8 based on the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Walker concluded that California had no rational basis or vested interest in denying gays and lesbians marriage licenses:An initiative measure adopted by the voters deserves great respect. The considered views and opinions of even the most highly qualified scholars and experts seldom outweigh the determinations of the voters. When challenged, however, the voters' determinations must find at least some support in evidence. This is especially so when those determinations enact into law classifications of persons. Conjecture, speculation and <b>fears</b> <b>are</b> not enough. Still less will the moral disapprobation of a group or class of citizens suffice, no matter how large the majority that shares that view. The evidence demonstrated beyond serious reckoning that Proposition 8 finds support only in such disapproval. As such, Proposition 8 is beyond the constitutional reach of the voters or their representatives. He further noted that Proposition 8 was based on traditional notions of opposite-sex marriage and on moral disapproval of homosexuality, neither of which is a legal basis for discrimination. He noted that gays and lesbians are exactly the type of minority that strict scrutiny was designed to protect.|$|E
25|$|The Sims Stories is {{a series}} of {{computer}} games from The Sims series released in 2007–2008 that is based on a modified version of The Sims 2 engine. This modified game engine is optimized for play on systems with weaker specifications such as laptops. As such, its system requirements are lower than that of The Sims 2, but it can still be played on desktops. One feature of this game, if played on a laptop, is the auto-pause function, which stops and starts the game when the lid is closed and opened, respectively. This series is introduced mainly for three segments of the market: those who wish to play The Sims 2 on their laptops (which usually have lower specifications); those who wish to engage in other activities such as instant messaging while playing the game, and; those who are new to the franchise. In addition to a Free Play mode with classic, open-ended game play, the games contain a structured, linear Story mode where players are required to complete a series of goals in order to progress in the storyline. While Life Stories and Pet Stories each contain two separate stories, Castaway Stories contains one story that is double the length of any one story in the first two games. As an introductory series, major features are removed or modified from those in The Sims 2. For example, <b>fears</b> <b>are</b> completely removed in all three games, and the elder life stage is completely removed in Pet Stories. Officially, the save files from this series are not compatible with the main The Sims 2 games. However, players have experienced success at adapting some files.|$|E

[...] Confessions is [...] "a remarkable exercise in self-exposure", playwright John Lazarus says in a review.

40|$|<b>Fear</b> <b>is</b> a {{universal}} human experience that shapes health {{and quality of}} life.

Fear can motivate people to engage in health-promoting activities or it can be a barrier to seeking appropriate timely healthcare.

[...] As it began to look more likely that war would break out, the nervous citizens of Kimberley appealed to the premier of the Cape Colony, William Philip Schreiner, for additional protection, but he did not believe the town to be under serious threat and declined to arm it further.

When Peggy shows up {{unexpectedly}} at another of Vince's parties, Vince {{is happy to}} see her at first but becomes upset when she says the purpose of her visit is to talk about business. Mr. Shores then approaches Vince with an offer from Geneva Records to purchase Laurel Records and sign him to a rich contract. Peggy refuses to sell, but Vince announces that he will close the deal since he owns a controlling interest, which deeply devastates Peggy. Enraged by Vince's attitude—and his treatment of Peggy—Hunk provokes Vince to fight, who refuses to fight back. [...] Hunk delivers several hard blows with the last one striking Vince in the throat, endangering his voice and therefore his singing ability. Vince is then rushed to a hospital, where he forgives Hunk and realizes he loves Peggy and she loves him. After being released from the hospital, Vince's doctor informs him that his vocal cords are fully recovered, but Vince is worried that his voice might have been affected. To test it, he sings [...] "Young and Beautiful" [...] to Peggy, which reassures him that his <b>fears</b> <b>are</b> unfounded.|$|E
500|$|Druckmann {{considers}} A Second Chance at Sarah to be a [...] "personal story" [...] that he [...] "wanted to tell".

The novel was inspired by Druckmann's interest in traveling {{back in time to}} meet his wife at a younger age. [...] "There's something cute and poetic about that idea," [...] he explained. This idea itself was inspired by time travel stories, particularly the Back to the Future film series (1985–90). Druckmann felt that A Second Chance at Sarah is [...] "a love story driven by grounded characters", not about the demons or time travel featured in the story; he considered the latter a [...] "secret weapon" [...] to attract more readers, and found it necessary to advance the story. Druckmann considered the characters [...] "interesting, yet flawed", and he and Wong worked to [...] "portray the subtlety of emotions". Druckmann felt that he shared many similarities with the novel's protagonist Johnny, and that [...] "a lot of Johnny's flaws and <b>fears</b> <b>are</b> based on [...] own shortcomings". He used the character to deal with his own fears of adulthood and of losing his wife, considering Johnny an [...] "exaggerated version" [...] of himself.|$|E
