40|$|Combustion {{synthesis}} {{has become}} an attractive method for preparing oxides and metallic materials for various applications including catalysts. One common combustion route is glycine–nitrate process (GNP). GNP involves a self-sustained reaction between metal nitrates (oxidizer) and glycine (fuel). The process {{is known to be}} rapid and simple, and generates catalyst powders that are high purity, crystalline and homogenous. In this work, <b>Ni</b> <b>catalysts</b> modified with La and Ce were synthesized using GNP. A precursor solution containing a stoichiometric mixture of metal nitrates was initially mixed with glycine at various glycine-nitrate ratios (G/N= 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5). The glycinenitrate solution was then heated to yield a gel-like liquid. The gel was further heated until it self-ignited and produced an ash powder. The catalyst ash was calcined at different temperatures (600 ‒ 800 °C) and then reduced at 700 °C. Catalyst characterization was performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Once produced using GNP, the La element in <b>Ni</b> <b>catalyst</b> modified with La was presence in a form of LaNiO phase.

The aim of this thesis is to investigate how different factors, especially the nature of the metal, additives and reaction conditions, determine the stability and selectivity of supported nonnoble metal catalysts for the aqueous processing of polyol feedstock. The stability of base metals (Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) under hydrothermal conditions is studied from a thermodynamic point of view in chapter 2. In chapter 3 the effect of hydrothermal reaction conditions on several types of catalyst support materials is investigated. Carbon nanofibers (CNF) are identified as a promising material in terms of stability. Carbon nanofiber supported Co, <b>Ni</b> and Cu <b>catalysts</b> are then compared to benchmark Pt catalysts for the aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol in chapter 4. Among these, the CNF supported <b>Ni</b> <b>catalyst</b> is identified as the most promising alternative to the platinum based catalysts, both in terms of stability and activity. However, the acidic reaction conditions are detrimental to the <b>catalyst</b> stability and <b>Ni</b> <b>catalysts</b> deactivated as a result of metal particle growth. Chapter 5 reports on the effect of reaction conditions on the stability of nickel nanoparticles supported on CNF, in the APR of ethylene glycol. By tuning the reaction conditions the stability of the <b>Ni</b> <b>catalyst</b> can be increased. More reducing conditions, i. e. higher reactant concentration and partial hydrogen pressure are advantageous. The use of more alkaline conditions has the most pronounced beneficial effect on the catalyst stability. In chapter 6 <b>Ni</b> <b>catalysts</b> supported on carbon nanotubes and ZrO 2 and optionally promoted with CaO are used for the aqueous reforming and hydrogenolysis of glycerol. The promotion of <b>Ni</b> <b>catalysts</b> with CaO prepared by coimpregnation results in highly dispersed CaO in close proximity to Ni. This increased the catalytic activity for the production of hydrogen and 1, 2 -propanediol compared to a physical mixture of CaO with the <b>Ni</b> <b>catalyst.</b> Additionally, CaO was found to have a beneficial effect on the catalyst stability. In chapter 7 the transformation of glycerol and ethylene glycol to hydrogen and organic acids (carboxylates) is investigated at relatively mild temperatures. The reaction takes place under alkaline conditions over both <b>Ni</b> and Cu <b>catalyst.</b> Copper was found to be more selective towards organic acids whereas higher hydrogen selectivities can be achieved with nickel catalysts. It is shown that this is a promising process for the production of organic acids when compared to the aerobic oxidation process.

Significant enhancement in activity was observed when the supported Ru catalysts were modified by KOH, but such effect was minimal in the cases of supported <b>Ni</b> <b>catalysts.</b> The results of N- 2 adsorption and transmission electron microscopy studies revealed that the Ni particles of Ni/MCM- 41 (TIE) prepared by template-ion exchange (TIE) method are largely located inside the pores of MCM- 41. Compared with the Ni/MCM- 41 (IMP) catalyst prepared by impregnation method, the Ni/MCM- 41 (TIE) <b>catalyst</b> exhibited appropriate <b>Ni</b> dispersion and weaker Ni/support interaction, and consequently higher catalytic activity. In terms of the remarkable changes in turnover frequency (TOF) with Ni dispersion oil different catalysts. it was demonstrated that NH 3 decomposition over Ni is significantly structure sensitive. Some unique metal clusters similar to B 5 active sites should be responsible for the catalytic activities. Preparation methodology has a substantial influence on metal dispersion. For the supported <b>Ni</b> <b>catalysts</b> prepared by the TIE method, the generated metal particles are very small and the constitution of unique active sites becomes unfavorable, which accounts for the apparently lower TOF values.

Here Ni/CNTs nanocomposites were prepared by microwave-assisted method and used as the catalyst for catalytic hydrolysis of NaBH 4. XRD and SEM characterization showed that uniform Ni/CNTs nanocomposites can be obtained through microwave heating and solvent optimization. Ni/CNTs nanocomposites exhibit excellent catalytic activity in the hydrolysis of NaBH 4, i. e., the average hydrogen generation rate at 25 oC is 840 ml. min- 1. g- 1 for the CNTs-supported Ni/CNTs, while the hydrogen generation rate of 86 ml. min- 1. g- 1 for unsupported <b>Ni</b> <b>catalyst.</b> Compared with the unsupported <b>Ni</b> <b>catalyst,</b> Ni/CNTs nanocomposites presented higher catalytic activity for hydrolysis of aqueous NaBH 4 solution...|$|R

A H 2 and CH 4 gas mixture with a 9 : 1 ratio {{was used as a}} precursor for the synthesis of MWCNT on Ni-coated TaN/Si(100) substrates. The structure and composition of <b>Ni</b> <b>catalyst</b> nanoparticles were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The present findings showed that denser <b>Ni</b> <b>catalyst</b> nanoparticles and more vertically aligned MWCNTs could be effectively achieved at higher flow rates. From Raman results, we found that the intensity ratio of G and D bands (I [...]...|$|R
