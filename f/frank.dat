50|$|When {{the company}} pays a dividend, {{either in the}} same year or later, it may attach a <b>franking</b> credit from its <b>franking</b> account, in {{proportion}} to the tax rate. So each $0.70 of dividend may have $0.30 of <b>franking</b> credit attached. The <b>franking</b> amount is again just a record, only $0.70 of cash is paid. Such a dividend is called a <b>franked</b> dividend.|$|R

5|$|Critics cite {{a number}} of {{problems}} with the conviction. Local newspaper coverage, even before <b>Frank</b> was officially charged, was deemed to be inaccurate and prejudicial.

40|$|Based on the Officer (1994) model, Gray and Hall (2006) derive a {{relation}} between <b>franking</b> credits {{and the market}} risk premium. On {{the basis of this}} relation, the authors show that traditional estimates of the value of <b>franking</b> credits imply dividend yields that are inconsistent with historical equity market data. This inconsistency arises from assumptions about the <b>franking</b> credit payout ratio and the value of <b>franking</b> credits retained. With less than a 100 per cent payout ratio some <b>franking</b> credits are retained within the firm. Assuming that the retained <b>franking</b> credits have no value leads to the inconsistency in dividend yields. Current practice in the application of Officer's model makes this assumption and, therefore, leads to inconsistent results. Gray and Hall suggest resolving the inconsistency by setting the value of all <b>franking</b> credits to zero. An alternative solution is to recognize that retained <b>franking</b> credits might have a positive value. Copyright (c) The Authors. ...|$|R
