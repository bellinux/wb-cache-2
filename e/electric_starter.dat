25|$|One of {{the first}} four-wheeled petrol-driven {{automobiles}} in Britain was built in Birmingham in 1895 by Frederick William Lanchester, who also patented the disc brake and the first <b>electric</b> <b>starter</b> was installed on an Arnold, an adaptation of the Benz Velo, built in Kent between 1895 and 1898.|$|E
25|$|In 1939 Harry Merritt, an Allis-Chalmers executive, decided that, {{with over}} 90 percent of WCs selling with the {{optional}} <b>electric</b> <b>starter</b> and lights, these features would henceforth be standard equipment. Thus the WC {{became one of}} the earliest farm tractors (to Buescher's knowledge, the first) to have starter and lights as standard equipment.|$|E
25|$|The engine's {{propeller}} {{drive is}} via a Rotax type C or E style gearbox. The standard engine includes a muffler exhaust system and an intake silencer and filter, with an after muffler also available to further reduce engine noise. The standard starter is an <b>electric</b> <b>starter.</b> An integral {{alternating current generator}} produces 12 volts and 200 watts.|$|E
50|$|Compared to <b>electric</b> <b>starters,</b> air-starters have {{a higher}} power-to-weight ratio. <b>Electric</b> <b>starters</b> and their wiring can become {{excessively}} hot if it takes longer than expected to start the engine, while air-starters can be run {{as long as their}} air supply lasts. Turbine starters are much simpler and are a natural fit for turbine engines, and thus are used extensively on large turbofan engines used on commercial and military aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Kick {{start is}} a method of {{starting}} an internal combustion engine (usually that of a motorcycle) by pushing a ratcheting lever with one's foot. Kick start mechanisms were almost universally a part of motorcycle engines before the mid-1970s, and were phased out of production over {{the next twenty years}} or so as <b>electric</b> <b>starters</b> became standard equipment. There are still some motorcycles produced that have both kick and <b>electric</b> <b>starters.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>starters</b> are {{now almost}} {{universal}} for {{small and medium-sized}} engines, while pneumatic starters are used for large engines.|$|R
25|$|The initial kit {{price was}} US$24,500 and {{included}} the Rotax 582 powerplant, fiberglass enclosure, basic instrumentation, <b>electric</b> <b>starter,</b> landing lights and navigation lights. The components came pre-painted {{in a variety}} of optional colors. The composite tail and main rotor blades were advertised as “lifetime on condition", indicating no fixed lifespan. Assembly time was advertised as 40 hours.|$|E
25|$|The CB750 was {{the first}} modern four-cylinder machine from a {{mainstream}} manufacturer, and the term superbike was coined to describe it. Adding to the bike's value were its <b>electric</b> <b>starter,</b> kill switch, dual mirrors, flashing turn signals, easily maintained valves, and overall smoothness and low vibration both under way and at a standstill. Much-later models from 1991 included maintenance-free hydraulic valves.|$|E
25|$|The engine's {{propeller}} {{drive is}} via a Rotax type B, C, or E style gearbox. The standard engine includes a muffler exhaust system {{with an extra}} after-muffler as optional. The standard starter is a recoil start type, with an <b>electric</b> <b>starter</b> optional. An integral alternating current generator producing 170watts at 12volts with external rectifier-regulator is optional. The engine includes an intake air filter and can be fitted with an intake silencer system.|$|E
50|$|Later {{versions}} of the Field-Marshall had more sophisticated starting systems available - <b>electric</b> <b>starters</b> were optional on the Series 3As.|$|R
5|$|Aluminium casting {{fitted to}} rear of crankcase. Houses drives to the camshafts, magnetos, coolant and oil pumps, supercharger, hand and <b>electric</b> <b>starters,</b> and the <b>electric</b> generator.|$|R
50|$|The {{technical}} {{sophistication of}} larger motorcycles such as fuel injection systems, {{capacitor discharge ignition}} and <b>electric</b> <b>starters,</b> were gradually fused into the underbone. With each addition, the underbone became zippier, sportier and trendier.|$|R
25|$|Citroën {{unveiled}} {{the car at}} the Paris Salon on 7 October 1948. The car on display was nearly identical to the 2CV type A that would be sold the next year, but it lacked an <b>electric</b> <b>starter,</b> the addition of which was decided {{the day before the}} opening of the Salon, replacing the pull cord starter. The canvas roof could be rolled completely open. The Type A had one stop light, and was only available in grey. The fuel level was checked with a dip stick/measuring rod, and the speedometer was attached to the windscreen pillar. The only other instrument was an ammeter.|$|E
25|$|Gasoline cars became ever {{easier to}} operate {{thanks to the}} {{invention}} of the <b>electric</b> <b>starter</b> by Charles Kettering in 1912, which eliminated the need of a hand crank for starting a gasoline engine, and the noise emitted by ICE cars became more bearable thanks {{to the use of the}} muffler, which Hiram Percy Maxim had invented in 1897. Finally, the initiation of mass production of gas-powered vehicles by Henry Ford brought their price down. By contrast, the price of similar electric vehicles continued to rise; by 1912, an electric car sold for almost double the price of a gasoline car.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the Mark C was {{available}} only as either the Standard Tourer or the Deluxe Tourer {{with a single}} bench seat, seating two or three people. The Deluxe version included an <b>electric</b> <b>starter</b> along with rear bumpers. The range was expanded in March 1954, when the Standard Family Safety and Deluxe Family Safety versions were added. On these models the bodywork was extended behind the front seat and, like the earlier Bond Family Safety Saloon, two child-size inward facing hammock-style seats were added in the gap. Factory advertising material resurrected the Safety label {{as part of this}} model's name, but it was generally dropped elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{dedicated}} off-road motorcycles {{and many}} ATVs use kick start systems {{due to the}} increased weight of <b>electric</b> <b>starters.</b> The majority of the inexpensive two-wheelers and sometimes three-wheelers in developing countries also use kick start levers.|$|R
50|$|The 10 and 11 did {{not have}} a {{speedometer}} and ashtray, the 11 takes advantage of the storage bag found in the 12. All had <b>electric</b> <b>starters,</b> wipers and the chromed muffler could be transverse or longitudinally mounted.|$|R
50|$|A factory {{modification}} to the supercharger gearing {{results in}} the engine producing 400 hp, while non-factory modifications have it producing as much as 460 hp. Such non-factory engines may also incorporate other upgrades, such as <b>electric</b> <b>starters</b> and electronic ignition.|$|R
25|$|Since the car {{was first}} invented, its {{controls}} have become fewer and simpler through automation. For example, all cars once had a manual controls for the choke valve, clutch, ignition timing, and a crank instead of an <b>electric</b> <b>starter.</b> However new controls have also been added to vehicles, making them more complex. Examples include air conditioning, navigation systems, and in car entertainment. Another trend is the replacement of physical knob and switches for secondary controls with touchscreen controls such as BMW's iDrive and Ford's MyFord Touch. Another change is that while early cars' pedals were physically linked to the brake mechanism and throttle, in the 2010s, cars have increasingly replaced these physical linkages with electronic controls.|$|E
25|$|An {{automobile}} self-starter is {{an electric}} motor that initiates rotational motion in an internal combustion engine before it can power itself, therefore eliminating the hand crank used to start engines. In 1911, Charles F. Kettering invented the automobile self-starter while working at National Cash Register and then sold them for installation on cars at the Cadillac company. There had been many attempts at producing an <b>electric</b> <b>starter</b> before, {{but none of them}} were successful. Most designs at that time called for the use of {{an electric motor}} attached to the engine's flywheel. However, in order to fit in the car's engine compartment, the device would have to be small, and therefore it would be unable to produce a sufficient enough amount of torque.|$|E
25|$|Electric cars enjoyed {{popularity}} {{between the}} late 19th century and early 20th century, when electricity {{was among the}} preferred methods for automobile propulsion, providing a level of comfort and ease of operation {{that could not be}} achieved by the gasoline cars of the time. Advances in internal combustion technology, especially the <b>electric</b> <b>starter,</b> soon rendered this advantage moot; the greater range of gasoline cars, quicker refueling times, and growing petroleum infrastructure, along with the mass production of gasoline vehicles by companies such as the Ford Motor Company, which reduced prices of gasoline cars to less than half that of equivalent electric cars, led to a decline in the use of electric propulsion, effectively removing it from important markets such as the United States by the 1930s. However, in recent years, increased concerns over the environmental impact of gasoline cars, higher gasoline prices, improvements in battery technology, and the prospect of peak oil, have brought about renewed interest in electric cars, which are perceived to be more environmentally friendly and cheaper to maintain and run, despite high initial costs, after a failed reappearance in the late-1990s.|$|E
50|$|After World War I, several {{advances}} were made: pneumatic tires {{replaced the}} previously common full rubber versions. <b>Electric</b> <b>starters,</b> power brakes, 4, 6, and 8 cylinder engines, closed cabs, and electric lighting followed. The first modern semi-trailer trucks also appeared. Touring car builders such as Ford and Renault entered the heavy truck market.|$|R
50|$|Wagner Electric Corporation {{was founded}} by Herbert Appleton Wagner and Ferdinand Schwedtmann (aka Francis Charles Schwedtman) in 1891. The company {{manufactured}} electric engines, electric motors and <b>electric</b> <b>starters</b> for early automobiles. They also made electric lights and many other electric-related products. In 1909, Wagner Electric started manufacturing their first automotive headlamp bulbs.|$|R
5000|$|The engine NW T was a {{four stroke}} OHC water cooled inline four. It had a {{capacity}} of 3563 cc, which gave an output of [...] The first T20s had to be started manually while later T20s had Bosch <b>electric</b> <b>starters.</b> The same engine was also used in NW TL-2 and NW TL-4 trucks.|$|R
500|$|The pushrod {{overhead}} valve (OHV) air-cooled four stroke {{single cylinder engine}} had a [...] bore × stroke, displacing , and could produce [...] at 9,500rpm, for [...] maximum speed of , under favorable conditions. The low compression ratio meant the engine could consume inexpensive and commonly available low octane fuel, as well as minimizing the effort to kick start the engine, making the extra weight and expense of an <b>electric</b> <b>starter</b> an unnecessary creature comfort. Though {{some of the many}} Super Cub variations came with both kick and electric start, the majority sold well without it. Even the latest 2011 model year Japanese domestic market (JDM) Super Cub 50 and Super Cub 110 versions, with modern technology and conveniences like fuel injection and a fuel gauge, were not offered with an electric start option.|$|E
2500|$|The KR175 ran on a [...] Fichtel & Sachs {{air-cooled}} {{single cylinder}} two-stroke engine positioned {{in front of}} the rear wheel, just behind the passenger's seat. The engine was started with a pull rope as standard, but there was an option of an <b>electric</b> <b>starter.</b> The <b>electric</b> <b>starter</b> became standard in 1954. The transmission was a sequential, positive-stop type with four speeds and no synchronization nor reverse gear.|$|E
2500|$|The air-cooling exhibit {{planned for}} the show [...] "will {{be one of the}} most novel ever {{attempted}} by the Franklin at an automobile show." [...] It consisted of a six-cylinder motor mounted on a chassis, and the motor was seen running, getting its power from the motor generator of the Entz <b>electric</b> <b>starter</b> system, which was regular equipment on Franklin models. The sloping hood of the cooling chassis had glass sides and a glass top. Additionally, the dash and toe board of the chassis also were made out of glass. This permitted the spectators to obtain a full view of the engine as it was run under the power of the <b>electric</b> <b>starter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Early cars did {{not have}} batteries, as their {{electrical}} systems were limited. A bell was used instead of an electric horn, headlights were gas-powered, and the engine was started with a crank. Car batteries became widely used around 1920 as cars became equipped with <b>electric</b> <b>starters.</b> The sealed battery, which did not require refilling, was invented in 1971.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] engine {{producing}} [...] {{became available}} in May 1954. The front suspension was later {{changed from a}} telescopic fork to an Earles-type leading link fork with a single suspension unit on {{left side of the}} fork. Later Bella scooters also had 12 V electricals powered by two 6 V batteries. <b>Electric</b> <b>starters</b> also became available on the Bella.|$|R
