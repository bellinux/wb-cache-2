500|$|A {{characteristic}} that places fungi {{in a different}} kingdom from plants, bacteria, and some protists is chitin in their cell walls. Similar to animals, fungi are heterotrophs; they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules, typically by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment. Fungi do not photosynthesise. Growth is their means of mobility, except for spores (a few of which are flagellated), which may travel through the air or water. Fungi are the principal decomposers in ecological systems. These and other differences place fungi in a single group of related organisms, named the Eumycota (true fungi or <b>Eumycetes),</b> which share a common ancestor (form a monophyletic group), an interpretation that is also strongly supported by molecular phylogenetics. This fungal group is distinct from the structurally similar myxomycetes (slime molds) and oomycetes (water molds). The discipline of biology devoted {{to the study of}} fungi is known as mycology (from the Greek μύκης mykes, meaning [...] "fungus"). In the past, mycology was regarded as a branch of botany, although it is now known fungi are genetically more closely related to animals than to plants.|$|E

40|$|All {{attempts}} by the usual mycological techniques to isolate 'Schizosaccharomyces ovis', have failed although other yeast-like organisms have been isolated, often in quantity, from rumen ingesta. None of these organisms have the characteristic properties of 'Schizosaccharomyces ovis' as present in sheep's rumen ingesta, viz. the power of quick fermentation of added glucose with simultaneous storage of massive amounts of glycogen in the cells. The rumen 'yeasts' have also been shown not to be Mucor spores or oidia or yeast like forms of Monilia which they resemble in size and shape. From this and other evidence, it is concluded that 'Schizosaccharomyces ovis' is misnamed and is probably {{not a member of}} the <b>Eumycetes</b> at all.

40|$|Background: Although mucoid {{impaction}} of the bronchi (MIB) is {{a well-known}} manifestation in allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM), when unknown samples or plural <b>eumycetes</b> are cultured from bronchial materials, several problems are encountered which can affect the definitive diagnostic process or successful treatment. Case Summary: The definitive diagnostic process of two patients [a 58 -(Case 1) and a 70 -(Case 2) year-old female] with MIB was: 1) to identify the existence of any allergic respiratory disorder, 2) to detect the fungi obtained from bronchial materials, with use of the 28 S rDNA sequencing and analysis, 3) to investigate whether the detected fungus was a probable etiologic antigen, and 4) to make the final diagnosis {{based on the results}} of the inhalation examinations using the antigenic solution of the fungi. As a treatment strategy, bronchial toilet and low dose itraconazole therapy were planned according to the clinical manifestations of each patient. Discussion: The two patients with MIB were successfully diagnosed as ABPM caused by Schizophyllum commune (Sc-ABPM) accompanied with hyperattenuating mucoid impaction. The reliability of some allergological makers as a substitution for the bronchoprovocation test should be clarified in near future. Clinical manifestations demonstrated in our cases suggested that the allergic reaction such as eosinophilic bronchoalveolitis spreading around the mucus plug was a primary lesion underlying the Sc-ABPM. The success of the treatment for Sc-ABPM will be achieved by the strategy targeting to fundamental condition and by the control of the disease recurrence by means of effective environmental management...|$|E
40|$|Parasitism {{is one of}} {{the earlier}} and common {{ecological}} interactions in the nature, occurring in almost all environments. Microbial parasites typically are characterized by their small size, short generation time, and high rates of reproduction, with simple life cycle occurring generally within a single host. They are diverse and ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems, comprising viruses, prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Recently, environmental 18 S-rDNA surveys of microbial eukaryotes have unveiled major infecting agents in pelagic systems, consisting primarily of the fungal order of Chytridiales (chytrids). Chytrids are considered the earlier branch of the <b>Eumycetes</b> and produce motile, flagellated zoospores, characterized by a small size (2 - 6 &# 181;m) and a single, posterior flagellum. The existence of these dispersal propagules includes chytrids within the so-called group of zoosporic fungi, which are particularly adapted to the plankton lifestyle where they infect a wide variety of hosts, including fishes, eggs, zooplankton, algae, and other aquatic fungi but primarily freshwater phytoplankton. Related ecological implications are huge because chytrids can killed their hosts, release substrates for microbial processes, and provide nutrient-rich particles as zoospores and short fragments of filamentous inedible hosts for the grazer food chain. Furthermore, based on the observation that phytoplankton chytridiomycosis preferentially impacts the larger size species, blooms of such species (e. g. filamentous cyanobacteria) may not totally represent trophic bottlenecks. Besides, chytrid epidemics represent an important driving factor in phytoplankton seasonal successions. In this review, I summarize the knowledge on the diversity, community structure, quantitative importance, and functional roles of fungal chytrids, primarily those who are parasites of phytoplankton, and infer the ecological implications and potentials for the food web dynamics and properties...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge about fungi {{diversity}} following different planting patterns {{could improve}} {{our understanding of}} soil processes and thus help us to develop sustainable management strategies. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the impact of different furrow-ridge mulching techniques on fungal diversity in rhizosphere soil under continuous cropping system. The investigated treatments were: flat plot without mulch (CK); flat plot with mulch (T 1); on-ridge planting with full mulch (T 2); on-furrow planting with full mulch (T 3); on-ridge planting with half mulch (T 4); and on-furrow planting with half mulch (T 5). NGS (Illumina) methods and ITS 1 sequences were used in monitoring fungi diversity of the potato rhizosphere soil. The fungi diversity in the rhizosphere soil was ranked in the order T 5 > T 2 > T 4 > T 1 > CK at the early growth stage and T 2 > T 3 > T 1 > T 4 > CK at the late growth stage of potato. The fungal communities found in the rhizosphere soil were Ascomycota, Zygomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and other unidentified fungal communities. Among the fungal community in the rhizosphere soil, Ascomycota was found to be dominant fungi population, with the highest percentage (89 %) in the T 5 soil whereas the T 2 soils had the lowest percentage (67 %). The Fusarium abundance in fully-mulched treated soils was higher than in half-mulched treated soil. The dominant genus in the T 4 soil was Mortierella, whereas lower populations (1 – 2 %) of Scutellinia, Cryphonectria, Acremonium, and Alternaria were found in that treatment. Among the <b>eumycetes,</b> the dominant fungal class in all treated soils was the Sordariomycetes, which ranged from 57 to 85 % in T 2 and T 5 soils, respectively. The Fusarium percentages in half-mulched treated soils (T 4 and T 5) were 55 and 28 % lower than that of complete mulched treated soils (T 2 and T 3), respectively. The cluster analysis results showed that, CK, T 4, and T 5 treated soils and T 1, T 2, and T 3 treated soils had similarities in microbial compositions, respectively. Potato tuber yield was greater under the on-ridge planting with full mulch (T 2) treated soil, followed by on-ridge planting with half-mulch (T 4) treated soil. The rhizosphere soil under the on-ridge planting with full-mulch (T 2) soil had the highest fungal diversity, suggesting that this management was the best environment for fungi, whereas the on-ridge planting with half-mulch (T 4) soil had the minimum abundance of Fusarium...|$|E
