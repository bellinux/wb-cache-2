5000|$|In July 1999, Caterpillar {{and five}} other diesel engine {{manufacturers}} signed a consent decree with the Justice Department and the State of California, after governmental investigations revealed violations of the Clean Air Act. The violation involves over a million diesel engines sold with defeat devices, devices that regulated emissions during pre-sale tests, but that could be disabled in favor of better performance during subsequent highway driving. Consequently, these engines [...] "...emit up to triple the permissible level of smog-forming nitrogen oxides (NOx). In 1998 alone, these violating vehicles emitted 1.3 million tons of additional NOx — an amount equal to the emissions of 65 million cars." [...] For this reason, Caterpillar was named the [...] "Clean Air Villain of the Month" [...] for August 2000 by the Clean Air Trust. The consent decree provided that $83 million be paid in civil penalties and determined new deadlines for meeting emissions standards. Caterpillar, however, was successful in lobbying for an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>deadlines</b> they considered too severe. Even so, in October 2002, Caterpillar - the only diesel engine company (of those that signed decrees) to fail to meet the new emissions standards deadline - was forced to pay $128 million in per-engine non-conformance penalties.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Selection of the {{requirements}} for the next release of a software product is a inherently complex task due to the high volume of intricate requirements and to the varied interests of the stake holders involved. In this paper we apply integer linear programming techniques to aid requirements managers of product software companies in release planning. The applied techniques take candidate requirements, estimated revenue per requirement (or combination of requirements), and available resources as input. Planning suppleness is added by way of allowing flexibility in team composition, team transfers, <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>deadlines</b> and hiring external resources. Through experiments {{the application of the}} proposed approach is demonstrated with real life data. Future additions to the model are identified, as well as improved validation. 1 Planning the next release Companies developing product or embedded software face challenges in determining the set of requirements for an upcoming release.

40|$|For {{software}} vendors, {{the process}} to determine the requirements for the next release of a software product is often difficult. In this paper we present a mathematical formalization of release composition with a corresponding optimization tool that aims to support product managers and development project managers during release planning. The tool is based on integer linear programming and assumes that an optimal set of requirements is the set with maximum projected revenue against available resources in a given time period. The input for the optimization is twofold. Input data like the list of candidate requirements, estimated revenue and required team resources per requirement, {{whether or not a}} requirement is mandatory, comprise the first type of input. Secondly, several managerial steering mechanisms provide flexibility in the optimization environment: team composition, permitting of team transfers, <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>deadlines,</b> and hiring external resources. Through experiments based on real-life data we make a sound case for the applicability of our proposal. 1 Requirements selection for release planning Companies developing software products face complex challenges when determining requirements for upcoming releases (see e. g. Potts (1995); Regnell and Brinkkemper, (2005)). Often the wish-list of requirements extends the capacity of available resources, requirements may not be unambiguous, they may be difficult to prioritize, etc. As a matter of fact, many aspects influence the definition of an optimal set of requirements for a next release.

40|$|There will be {{situations}} in which the Netherlands {{is not able to}} meet the objectives of the European Water Framework Directive. The RIVM presents a methodology for using applications <b>of</b> <b>extensions.</b> The <b>deadline</b> <b>of</b> the Water Framework Directive objectives is 2015. Example of such goal is obtaining a good groundwater quality for protecting terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems that are depending on groundwater. There are Dutch {{situations in}} which {{it will be hard to}} meet these objectives. The WFD introduces a number of exceptions, which we might need to apply in these cases. For example extending the deadline from 2015 to 2021 or 2027, or achieving a less stringent objective. This report provides a methodology to examine the possibilities of these exceptions in a given situation. The methodology is tested by two existing cases. One case concerns the exceeding of the EU standard for pesticides in groundwater by the substance bentazon. Nowadays only a quarter of the substance is used compared to 1998. Because natural attenuation of bentazon is very slow the intensive use of bentazon in the past is visible by the exceeding of the European standard for pesticides nowadays. So, in spite of the reduced use of the substance there will be exceeding of the quality standard in 2015 as well. For this case of historical contamination the Netherlands can apply <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the <b>deadline.</b> However, also the Dutch policy for admitting bentazon must be evaluated, because new exceeding of the quality standard can develop within the present policy...|$|R
