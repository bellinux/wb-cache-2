40|$|Distance {{teaching}} is now-a-days used in different shapes. However, {{it is something}} different from traditional campus organised education as it systematically uses Information Communication Technology (ICT) as a key element. When the <b>distance</b> teacher <b>education</b> started in Sweden many teacher educators doubted the wisdom of this. They expressed that the educational process to become a teacher would be deteriorated. For instance, they feared for high drop out rates and difficulties to examine in a proper way. The Swedish National Agency for Higher Education has recently edited a report that showed that this form of teacher education was well adapted to the labour market, but the possibilities for the teacher students to shape their education were relatively limited. However, we still know quite little {{about the effects of}} this way to educate teacher students. This paper explores the possibility of using <b>distance</b> teacher <b>education.</b> In a case study 20 students, who were the first to finish a complete a <b>distance</b> teacher <b>education</b> at H&# 246;gskolan Dalarna, were asked in a questionnaire how they had apprehended their education. We also interviewed four of these students, as well as five teacher educators. One of our findings were that the <b>distance</b> teacher <b>education</b> reached new target groups, who not had been able to participate in university studies if it not had been offered in this form. Especially, this was valid for the middle-aged women, living a long distance away from a university, with social responsibilities for children or old parents. Other findings were that these students in general were target oriented and ambitious, wrote more than the campus students and developed that kind of skill better. Marratech, an ICT system for small groups, e-mail and chat were used for the communication. Marratech was considered to permit free and spontaneous communication, both of the teacher educators and the students. Initially the teacher educators were sceptical to <b>distance</b> teacher <b>education,</b> but afterwards they were surprised of how well it had worked. They declared that they had better and nearer contact with their students and more control over the students&# 180; performance, but some parts of the teacher education were better suitable for campus education, for example, power of creating characters. <b>Distance</b> teacher <b>education</b> was considered time consuming and demanded much activity from the teacher educators as the students wanted rapid responses. This study indicates that <b>distance</b> teacher <b>education</b> works well for mature individuals with high motivation. However, it demands more time from the teacher educators, but it gives in general good results. Still, there are pedagogical challenges to overcome. Maybe we should reflect on a mix of <b>distance</b> teacher <b>education</b> and campus based teacher education, instead of separated ways of accomplishing teacher education...|$|R
