5|$|Some Vaishnava {{literature}} reverentially link Shiva to {{characters in}} its mythologies. For example, in the Hanuman Chalisa, Hanuman <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> the eleventh avatar of Shiva. The Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana claim sage Durvasa to be {{a portion of}} Shiva. Some medieval era writers have called the Advaita Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara an incarnation of Shiva.|$|E
5|$|Units can now level up in battle, {{increasing}} their capabilities. Units increase their level once for each enemy unit that they destroy. The level of each unit <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> I, II, or Vet, with Vet being the highest level. While units {{with higher levels}} are more powerful than new units, the power increase is slight. Unit experience is not persistent, and the player begins each mission with new units.|$|E

50|$|Congenital Generalized Lipodystrophy, {{also known}} as Berardinelli-Seip {{lipodystrophy}} was first described in 1954 by Berardinelli and later by Seip in 1959. The gene for type 1 CGL <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> AGPAT2 at chromosome 9q34, and later the gene for type 2 CGL <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> BSCL2 at chromosome 11q13. More recently, type 3 CGL <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> a separate type of CGL, which <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> a mutation in the CAV1 gene. Then, a separate type 4 CGL <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> a mutation in the PTRF gene.|$|R
5|$|A fragmentary molar, {{preserving}} two cusps, <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> from a multituberculate. Although multituberculates {{are common}} in nearly contemporaneous deposits in Laurasia, this tooth {{is one of the}} few records from Gondwana; a few fragmentary remains, the multituberculate affinities of some of which are disputed, are also known from South America (Argentodites), Africa (Hahnodon), and Australia (Corriebaatar). Another fragmentary tooth, UA 8699, is recognizable as a tribosphenic lower molar. Krause identified it in 2001 as a marsupial, but in 2003 a group led by Alexander Averianov instead argued that the tooth was placental and related to zhelestids (a primitive group possibly related to ungulates). Both placentals and marsupials are mostly known from Laurasia during the Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} an incurable {{neurodegenerative}} disease which most often affects {{the elderly and}} {{accounts for more than}} half of all cases of dementia. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> a protein misfolding disease. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic aggregations of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, caused by Aβ misfolding and clumping together with other Aβ peptides. These Aβ aggregates then grow into significantly larger senile plaques, a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of Aβ aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.|$|E
5|$|As Luis Cardinal <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> Skinner's shooter, the Syndicate admonishes the Smoking Man {{for moving}} the UFO {{to a new}} location. By rubbing a pencil over the {{envelope}} containing the tape case, Mulder finds a phone number which connects him to the Syndicate's office. Mulder speaks to the Well-Manicured Man, who offers to meet with him. The Well-Manicured Man tells Mulder that a UFO was sunk during World War II and that a cover story of a sunken atomic bomb was used to cover up its attempted recovery. He reveals that anyone can be gotten to, causing Mulder to ask Scully to check on Skinner.|$|E

5|$|Fragments 2 and 3, giving {{accounts}} of Jesus' baptism and temptation or transfiguration, {{spring from the}} widespread Greco-Roman myth of the descent of divine Wisdom; this underlies the parallel passages in the gospels of Matthew(11.25–30), Luke(7.18–35 and 11.49–51) and John(1.1–18), {{as well as the}} Gospel of Thomas. The differences between fragment 3 and the orthodox canonical gospels are considerable: their third-person narrative has become an account by Jesus himself, Satan is replaced by the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> Jesus' mother.|$|E
5|$|He {{moved to}} Bucharest {{at the age}} of eleven, and {{attended}} the Schemitz-Tierin boarding school. It is believed that the young Tzara completed his secondary education at a state-run high school, which <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> the Saint Sava National College or as the Sfântul Gheorghe High School. In October 1912, when Tzara was aged sixteen, he joined his friends Vinea and Marcel Janco in editing Simbolul. Reputedly, Janco and Vinea provided the funds. Like Vinea, Tzara was also close to their young colleague Jacques G. Costin, who was later his self-declared promoter and admirer.|$|E
5|$|Liz, part of Passions Russell family, is {{introduced}} as a resort owner {{involved in the}} love triangle between Sheridan Crane and Antonio Lopez-Fitzgerald and his brother Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald. She gains more prominence on the series as the antagonist and foil to her adoptive sister Eve Russell. Liz's desperation to expose her sister's past relationship—and child—with Julian Crane leads to {{the breakup of the}} latter's marriage and family. Later storylines focus on her relationship with Eve's husband T. C. Russell and attempts to murder Alistair Crane for raping her as a teenager. Liz eventually abandons her vendetta against Eve and Alistair in order to find love in the future. Following her exit from the series, Liz <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> the biological mother of Chad Harris-Crane, which proves his relationship with Whitney Russell is not incestuous.|$|E

5|$|One of Yaponchik's victims <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> a restorer of Russian icons. Her home is searched, and it {{is found}} that she had {{uncovered}} Yaponchik's identity and attempted to appease him by sending him several icons. Black feels Yaponchik is killing in order to perpetuate the legends surrounding him by instilling fear in those who believe them. Watts and Black visit the Russian Embassy to find the man the icons were being mailed to—Sergei Stepanovich, identifiable as Yaponchik. Stepanovich is protected by diplomatic immunity; however, it becomes clear that Surova, Medikov and an Orthodox priest who aided the investigation have all been stalking Stepanovich, who they believe to be the Antichrist.|$|E
5|$|Ruler 2 acceded to {{the throne}} of Toniná in 668. His rule is marked by warfare and the {{frequent}} depiction of bound captives on his monuments. Ruler 2 established the use of in-the-round sculptural style that came to typify the stelae of Toniná. A monument dated to 682 depicts three naked prisoners with their arms bound, one of them <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> a lord from Annak', an as yet unidentified site. His reign may have ended with his defeat and capture by K'inich Kan Balam II of Palenque in September 687, as described in a glyphic text from Temple 17 in the rival city, an event that probably culminated in his sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Tenth-century sources {{describe}} Israel as a bishop; around 950 a {{man with}} this name <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> Bishop of Aix-en-Provence, {{but it is not}} certain that he was the same person. Between 948 and 950 he may have held a bishopric in Aachen, where he debated Christian ideas about the Trinity with a Jewish intellectual called Salomon, probably the Byzantine ambassador of that name. He retired to become a monk at the Benedictine monastery of Saint-Maximin in Trier, and died on 26 April in an unknown year. Lapidge sets his death in about 970, whereas Wood dates it before 967–68.|$|E

Bardale is ordered to cut the landlord's leg off while he is still alive; the leg is later found in a postal depot in a package.|$|E

The tooth is 2.48mm long and 2.07mm wide. Part of the back labial corner is missing.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} told {{in the form of}} a series of {{interviews}} conducted by the narrator, Max Brooks, an agent of the United Nations Postwar Commission. Although the exact origin of the plague is unknown, a young boy from a village in China <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> the plague's official patient zero. The boy's case marks the point where the Chinese government begins to take measures to cover up the disease, including generating a crisis with Taiwan to mask their activities. Nevertheless, the plague still manages to spread to various nations by human trafficking, refugees and the black market organ trade. Initially, these nations were able to cover up their smaller outbreaks, until a much larger outbreak in South Africa brings the plague to public attention.|$|E
