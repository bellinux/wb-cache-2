5|$|Five {{weeks after}} Homer made his pledge to behave, Marge realizes {{that she is}} bored by all the sudden peace and quiet. The {{demolition}} derby form flies into her hand, and she decides to give <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try.</b> When she leaves, Homer wakes up and finds Marge is gone {{and so is the}} demolition derby form, so he heads off to the derby with the kids to stop her. Although Marge initially enjoys the demolition derby, things soon get too dangerous for her. Homer has no idea how to save her, as he has given up being reckless. Bart comes up with an idea and calls for a beer can from a vendor. Homer then drinks the beer and rescues Marge (in a style similar to Popeye), who makes him promise not to make her the live wire in the family.|$|E
25|$|Kirkwood {{enlisted in}} the Air Force in 1958. The {{following}} year, Kirkwood learned of the Modern Pentathlon and determined to give <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try.</b> He expressed an interest with the Army and was given a tryout at the U.S. Modern Pentathlon Training Center at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas where {{the bulk of the}} U.S. pentathletes were training for the 1960 Summer Olympics. While he wasn't able to make that 1960 team he did attend the games in Rome as a spectator. Kirkwood showed enough promise that the Army allowed him to be permanently assigned to Fort Sam Houston to train for the next Olympics.|$|E
25|$|Harold is aghast, worried if {{the foreign}} police will believe the story {{both he and}} Elsie have to tell and that their 'relationship' is innocent. The {{evidence}} points to manslaughter at best and murder at worst. Mrs Rice suddenly has an idea and wonders if the hotel management and foreign police are open to bribery. Harold agrees to give <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try</b> and wires for money but aside from that, and unable to speak the local language, leaves Mrs Rice {{to carry out the}} negotiations. All seems to go well and the next day Harold sees Mrs Rice speaking with a police officer and she tells him that the death has been declared as being from natural causes and that they are all in the clear. That is until the two Polish women approach Mrs Rice and speak to her. She translates for Harold and tells him that they know what really happened (their room being next to Elsie's) and that they are blackmailing the English people.|$|E

500|$|The elder Lajoie, {{who worked}} as a {{teamster}} and laborer, died not long into the younger Lajoie's childhood, which forced him and his siblings to work to support the family. Lajoie dropped out of school to work in a textile mill. He also began playing semi-professional baseball for the local Woonsocket team under the alias [...] "Sandy", because his parents did not approve of their son playing baseball. He earned money as a taxi driver with a horse and buggy and locally was called [...] "Slugging Cabby." [...] "When I told my father I had decided to take the job he was very angry. He shouted that ball players were bums and that nobody respected them, but I was determined to give <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try</b> at least one season", Lajoie later said. He also received the nickname [...] "Larry" [...] from a teammate who had trouble pronouncing Lajoie. Lajoie admired baseball players such as King Kelly and Charles Radbourn.|$|E
500|$|While {{the roles}} of Homer and Marge were given to Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner because they were already {{a part of the}} Tracey Ullman Show cast, the {{producers}} decided to hold casting for {{the roles of}} Bart and Lisa. Nancy Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa, but disliked the character's bland description—Lisa was described simply as the [...] "middle child"—and read for the role of Bart instead. Casting director Bonita Pietila brought Yeardley Smith in for an audition after seeing her performing in the play Living on Salvation Street. Smith was hesitant to audition for an animated series, but her agent had persuaded her to give <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try.</b> Smith originally auditioned for the role of Bart but Pietila believed her voice was too high. Smith later recalled: [...] "I always sounded too much like a girl, I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'" [...] Pietila offered Smith the role of Lisa instead.|$|E
2500|$|Mrs. Garby {{offered to}} take care of the love {{interest}} and the romantic dialogue, and Smith decided to give <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try.</b> The sources of inspirations for the main characters in the novel were themselves; the [...] "Seatons" [...] and [...] "Cranes" [...] were based on the Smiths and Garbys, respectively. About one-third of The Skylark of Space was completed by the end of 1916, when Smith and Garby gradually abandoned work on it.|$|E

We are not ignorant, sir,' said Mr. Chillip, slowly shaking his little head again, 'down in {{our part of the}} country, of your fame. There must be great excitement here, sir,' said Mr. Chillip, tapping himself on the forehead with his forefinger. 'You must find <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>trying</b> occupation, sir!' ...|$|R

2500|$|IGN's Stephen Butts scored it 8.3 out of 10, {{calling it}} [...] "one {{of the best}} console {{experiences}} on the PC in a while." [...] He praised the controls and boss fights, but criticized the difficulty and platforming sections. He concluded [...] "when a game comes out for the PC that manages to retain all the simplicity and energy of its console brother, then you owe it yourself to give <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try.</b> MDK 2 is definitely such a game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Daniel Ash, {{his friend}} David J. Haskins, and Haskins' younger brother Kevin, had played {{together}} in various bands since childhood. One of the longer-lived {{of these was}} a band called the Craze, which performed a few times around Northampton in 1978. However, The Craze still split up fairly quickly, and Ash once again tried to convince his old school friend Murphy to join him, simply because Ash thought {{he had the right}} look for a band. Murphy, who was working in a printing factory, decided to give <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try,</b> despite never having written any lyrics or music. During their first rehearsal, he co-wrote the song [...] "In the Flat Field".|$|E
2500|$|In January 1910, Leninists, {{followers}} of Bogdanov, and various Menshevik factions held {{a meeting of}} the party's Central Committee in Paris and tried to re-unite the party. Kamenev and Zinoviev were dubious about the idea, but were willing to give <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try</b> under pressure from [...] "conciliator" [...] Bolsheviks like Victor Nogin. Lenin was adamantly opposed to re-unification, but was outvoted within the Bolshevik leadership. The meeting reached a tentative agreement. As one of its provisions, Trotsky's Vienna-based Pravda was designated as a party-financed 'central organ'. Kamenev, Trotsky's brother-in-law, was added to Pravda's editorial board {{as a representative of the}} Bolsheviks in this process. The unification attempts failed in August 1910, when Kamenev resigned from the board amid mutual recriminations.|$|E

Both {{the other}} witches repeat this after First Witch, {{and take the}} Uncommercial {{measurement}} with their eyes, as for a charmed winding- sheet.

50|$|Schwestern im Geiste ("Sisters in Mind") is {{a musical}} written in German {{language}} by Peter Lund (lyrics), with music by Thomas Zaufke and choreography by Neva Howard. The musical was co-produced by the University of Arts Berlin and the Neukölln Opera. The issue of emancipation is told {{from the perspective}} of three young women in contemporary Berlin {{on the one hand and}} by three pastors daughters who live during the Victorian era in England on the other. <b>It's</b> <b>a</b> <b>try</b> of undertaking <b>a</b> musical journey.|$|R

2500|$|Sagan {{joined a}} Pro Tour team [...] for road testing {{but failed to}} secure a contract. His {{frustration}} was so deep {{that he decided to}} quit road cycling, however pressed by his family he gave <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try</b> with [...] and succeeded. Liquigas' Zanatta offered Sagan a two-year contract (2010–2011) with an option to ride mountain bikes for Cannondale. In April 2010 the contract was extended to 2012. Liquigas doctors and managers were stunned by results of Sagan's medical tests, saying that they had never seen a 19-year-old rider as physically strong and capable. During the training camp Sagan destroyed more mountain bikes than any other rider due to his ability to put a bike through its paces. This earned him the nickname [...] "Terminator".|$|E
2500|$|Finally, Gold {{shows up}} to confront Ingrid, blaming her for ruining his plan, but Ingrid says it that was Elsa who interfered, {{remarking}} {{that they were}} [...] "like sisters." [...] Gold vows that he'll make Ingrid pay, {{but now that the}} Snow Queen has harnessed Emma and Elsa's powers after she placed the ribbons on their wrists, she claims that she has become much more powerful, possibly even powerful enough to defeat Mr. Gold and decorate her palace [...] "with his bones." [...] When she wonders whether she should give <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try,</b> Mr. Gold warns her not to overestimate her powers, but Ingrid warns Mr. Gold not to underestimate her powers, in response. Then, the Snow Queen smiles with delight while using her new-found powers to cast the Spell of Shattered Sight over Storybrooke, which shatters her mirror in the process.|$|E
2500|$|Odeon, the German arm of EMI (the {{parent company}} of the Beatles' record label, Parlophone) was {{convinced}} that the Beatles' records would not sell in Germany unless they were sung in German. The Beatles detested the idea, and when they were due to record the German version on 27 January 1964 at EMI's Pathe Marconi Studios in Paris (where the Beatles were performing 18 days of concerts at the Olympia Theatre) they chose to boycott the session. Their record producer, George Martin, having waited some hours for them to show up, was outraged and insisted that they give <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try.</b> Two days later, the Beatles recorded [...] "Komm, gib mir deine Hand", {{one of the few times}} in their career that they recorded outside London. However, Martin later conceded: [...] "They were right, actually, it wasn’t necessary for them to record in German, but they weren’t graceless, they did a good job".|$|E
