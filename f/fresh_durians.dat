50|$|Balik Pulau {{is famous}} for its {{agricultural}} plantations, which are rarely found elsewhere on Penang Island. In recent years, agricultural tourism is booming in Balik Pulau, as tourists from other states and abroad flock to the town to sample <b>fresh</b> <b>durians</b> and nutmegs.|$|E
50|$|In 2000s, Sungai Ruan {{produced}} peanuts, dragonfruit and coconut. Best {{selling in}} Sungai Ruan is peanut, during the Chinese New Year, villagers return home {{and brought a}} lot of the peanut for gift to friends and neighbour. In 2009 Malaysia government planning export of frozen durians to China. The projected export of frozen durians from Malaysia to China is between 350 tonnes and 500 tonnes a year. Malaysia exported <b>fresh</b> <b>durians</b> worth an estimated RM18.5 million to Singapore, against RM15.4 million in 2010.|$|E
50|$|Balik Pulau's attractions {{are more}} agricultural, {{alluding}} to the huge role agriculture has played in the town's economy and its laid-back pace of life. The town is famous for some of Penang's most well-known products - nutmegs, durians and cloves. In recent years, agricultural tourism is booming in Balik Pulau, as tourists from other states and abroad flock to the town to sample <b>fresh</b> <b>durians</b> and nutmegs. For instance, Balik Pulau's durian orchards, which produce {{a wide variety of}} durian cultivars, are best visited during the durian harvesting season between May and August each year. Balik Pulau's nutmeg farms and shops also offer samples of nutmeg fruits and products, including nutmeg juice.|$|E
25|$|Budu is a salted (fermented) anchovy sauce eaten {{mainly as}} {{flavouring}} with rice, grilled fish and vegetables/salads (ulam). A bit of lime juice, hot chilis and shallots are added on for taste. Also, tempoyak (fermented <b>durian)</b> or <b>fresh</b> <b>durian</b> is added for good measure. Once so combined, the purple-brownish condiment has {{a blend of}} salty and sour taste. Sometimes, Budu is used in cookings {{as part of the}} ingredient.|$|R
5|$|Raw durian is {{composed}} of 65% water, 27% carbohydrates (including 4% dietary fiber), 5% fat and 1% protein. In 100 grams, raw or <b>fresh</b> frozen <b>durian</b> provides 33% of the Daily Value (DV) of thiamin and moderate content of other B vitamins, vitamin C and the dietary mineral, manganese (15–24% DV, table).|$|R
40|$|Local {{traditional}} fermented foods {{consisting of}} seven samples of tempoyak (made from <b>fresh</b> <b>durian</b> fruit), six samples of budu (made from boiled fish), four samples of tempeh (made from boiled soybean), two samples of vegetable pickle (made from raw cabbage) and one sample of tapai (made from cooked glutinous rice), {{were used as}} samples for the isolation of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). A number of samples for different fermented foods like tempoyak, budu and vegetable pickle were screened as they were fermented by microorganisms naturally present in the food. One hundred isolates were obtained and by sequential screening for catalase activity and Gram-staining, 20 isolates were determined to be Lactobacillus. Ten isolates with the highest enzymatic activities were selected based on the biochemical reactions of the API ZYM kit. Canola meal (CM) was treated with the ten Lactobacillus isolates in solid state fermentation for 30 days. The most efficient LAB isolate was identified as lactobacillus salivarius and significantly reduced the total glucosinolate and crude fibre content of CM by 38 % and 16 %, respectively...|$|R
50|$|Ideally, the {{floating}} market’s produce and fruit are normally grown from nearby gardens or local orchards. Such produce are the assorted tropical {{fruits and vegetables}} such as rambutan, mango, pineapple, dragon fruit, star fruits, <b>fresh</b> coconut and <b>durian.</b>|$|R
40|$|Banyuwangi regency has red fleshed durians which grow {{naturally}} {{and also}} cannot {{be found in}} other areas because of it is an endemic species from Banyuwangi. The information about red durian nutrients compositions are not available yet, whereas those composition are important in determining of red durian nutrient composition, handling techniques, and further processes. This research was conducted to analyze the nutrient composition of eight (8) variant of Banyuwangi’s red durians, and compare the nutritional compositions of yellow and white durians {{which can be found}} around the location of red durians. The eight variants of Banyuwangi’s red durians which used in this study are Serat, Serat Pink, Musang Merah, Tallun Jeruk, Sun rice of Java, Red Horny Jameela, Red King, and Pelangi. In this research, the nutrient content in 100 g of <b>fresh</b> <b>durian</b> flesh samples for 10 parameters were analyzed, such as protein (%), fat (%), carbohydrates (%), total sugar (%), calories (cal/g), vitamin C (mg/ 100 g), Zinc (Zn) (ppm), iron (Fe) (ppm), potassium (K) (%), and sulfur (S) (%). Furthermore, the data were analyzed descriptively. The results showed that Serat Pink durian has higher protein content than other red durians and white durians. All red durian have lower protein content than yellow durians. Tallun jeruk durian has higher fat, calories, and sulfur (S) content than other red durians, yellow and white durians. Red Horny Jameela durian has higher carbohydrate content than other red durians and white durians, but it is lower tha...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the infection biology of Phytophthora palmivora on durian leaf and fruit. Zoospores of P. palmivora are preferentially attracted to <b>fresh</b> wounds in <b>durian</b> and such wounds are {{shown to be}} key infection courts. Overlapping layers of peltate trichomes cover the stipules, lower surface of the leaf, petiole, young stem and fruit, and are the first point of contact between the pathogen and the host on these tissues. The pathogen binds randomly {{to the surface of}} the trichomes but is unable to penetrate the heavily lignified walls, however the hypha can grow over the edge of the trichome until it reaches the epidermal surface beneath. The stomata that occur beneath the trichomes on all tissues are readily infected by the advancing hyphal strands, and are also major infection courts. When infection occurs through fresh wounds in leaves, lesions appear within 2 days and leaves are entirely diseased within 6 days. Treatment of durian seedlings with phosphonate before inoculation with P. palmivora led to a significant restriction of the pathogen, but only if leaves were inoculated while still attached to the tree, and not if they were excised before inoculation. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity was not stimulated in excised inoculated leaves from phosphonate-treated durian seedlings, compared to untreated seedlings...|$|R
40|$|Three {{strains of}} Gram-staining-positive, coccus-shaped, lactic acid bacteria, {{designated}} as HibF 3 T, HibF 2 and HibF 5 were isolated from fresh flowers of hibiscus, and a fourth, DF 1 T, was isolated from <b>fresh</b> flowers of <b>durian</b> tree, in Penang, Malaysia. Taxonomic characterisation {{was performed by}} polyphasic analysis. Sequence similarities of the 16 S rRNA gene and the housekeeping rpoA and pheS genes of these strains with their closely-related lactococcal and streptococcal relatives were 92 – 94, 78 and 81 %, respectively. The results of phylogenetic analysis indicated that strains DF 1 T, HibF 2, HibF 5 and HibF 3 T were clustered together but were clearly separated from species of the genera Streptococcus and Lactococcus, indicating that they represent members of a novel genus of the family Streptococcaceae. Calculation of average nucleotide identity (ANI) values between the genomes of DF 1 T and HibF 3 T yielded values of 92. 50 – 92. 93 %. ANI values below the cut-off value and distinctive chemotaxonomic characteristics supported the hypothesis that these strains represented two novel species. Major cellular fatty acids in DF 1 T, HibF 2 and HibF 5 were C 18 : 1 ! 7 c and C 16 : 0, while C 12 : 0 and C 14 : 0 were also dominant, in addition to C 18 : 1 ! 7 c and C 16 : 0, in HibF 3 T. A novel genus is proposed with the name Floricoccus gen. nov. which consists of two species, Floricoccus tropicus sp. nov as the type species, and Floricoccus penangensis sp. nov. The respective type strains are DF 1 T(=LMG 29833 T=JCM 31733 T) and HibF 3 T (=LMG 29831 T=DSM 31735 T) ...|$|R
