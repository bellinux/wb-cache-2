5|$|Historically, {{competitive}} devaluations {{have been}} rare as countries have generally preferred {{to maintain a}} high value for their currency. Countries have generally allowed market forces to work, or have participated <b>in</b> <b>systems</b> of managed exchanges rates. An exception occurred when a currency war {{broke out in the}} 1930s when countries abandoned the gold standard during the Great Depression and used currency devaluations in an attempt to stimulate their economies. Since this effectively pushes unemployment overseas, trading partners quickly retaliated with their own devaluations. The period is considered to have been an adverse situation for all concerned, as unpredictable changes in exchange rates reduced overall international trade.|$|E

40|$|The bio-economic {{approach}} {{was used to}} calculate economic weights for twelve production (dairy and growth), functional and carcass traits of Slovak Pinzgau cattle raised in dairy (A) and cow-calf (B) system. The breeding heifers for own herd replacement with ten reproduction cycles at maximum was produced. The sale of surplus male and female calves was assumed after finishing of weaning period <b>in</b> both <b>systems.</b> Milk production is with quota limited in Slovakia, but the quotas limits aren’t filling up if the whole dairy population is taken into account. <b>In</b> the <b>system</b> A, the base price per milk value was corrected according to the fat and protein content and somatic cells count. The marginal economic weights were calculated as the numeric derivation of the profit function. Marginal values were standardized (multiplied by the genetic standard deviation of the appropriate trait) and expressed as relative values (percentage proportion). The marginal economic weight for milk yield (+ 0. 20 €) and for dressing percentage (+ 0. 39 €) were the lowest <b>in</b> both <b>systems.</b> The highest marginal importance was found for production lifetime of cows <b>in</b> <b>system</b> A (+ 69. 26 € per year and cow), and <b>in</b> <b>system</b> B (+ 52. 55 € per year and cow), respectively. Functional traits achieved the highest marginal values <b>in</b> both <b>systems.</b> But the relative economic values for the functional traits complex represent only 37. 04 % <b>in</b> <b>system</b> A, and 73. 52 % <b>in</b> <b>system</b> B, respectively. The proportion of functional, production and carcass traits complexes was 37. 04 : 62. 73 : 0. 23 <b>in</b> <b>system</b> A, and 73. 52 : 26. 07 : 0. 41 <b>in</b> <b>system</b> B.

5|$|The massive-star model {{probably}} {{does not explain}} all types of gamma-ray burst. There is strong evidence that some short-duration gamma-ray bursts occur <b>in</b> <b>systems</b> with no star formation and no massive stars, such as elliptical galaxies and galaxy halos. The favored theory for the origin of most short gamma-ray bursts is the merger of a binary system consisting of two neutron stars. According to this model, the two stars in a binary slowly spiral towards each other because gravitational radiation releases energy until tidal forces suddenly rip the neutron stars apart and they collapse into a single black hole. The infall of matter into the new black hole produces an accretion disk and releases a burst of energy, analogous to the collapsar model. Numerous other models have also been proposed to explain short gamma-ray bursts, including the merger of a neutron star and a black hole, the accretion-induced collapse of a neutron star, or the evaporation of primordial black holes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{present an}} {{approach}} where probabilistic logic {{is combined with}} default reasoning from conditional knowledge bases in Kraus et al. 's System P, Pearl's System Z, and Lehmann's lexicographic entailment. The resulting probabilistic generalizations of default reasoning from conditional knowledge bases allow for handling in a uniform framework strict logical knowledge, default logical knowledge, as well as purely probabilistic knowledge. Interestingly, probabilistic entailment <b>in</b> <b>System</b> P coincides with probabilistic entailment under g-coherence from imprecise probability assessments. We then analyze the semantic and nonmonotonic properties of the new formalisms. It turns out that they all are proper generalizations of their classical counterparts and have similar properties as them. In particular, they all satisfy the rationality postulates of System P and some Conditioning property. Moreover, probabilistic entailment <b>in</b> <b>System</b> Z and probabilistic lexicographic entailment both satisfy the property of Rational Monotonicity and some Irrelevance property, while probabilistic entailment <b>in</b> <b>System</b> P does not. We also analyze {{the relationships between the}} new formalisms. Here, probabilistic entailment <b>in</b> <b>System</b> P is weaker than probabilistic entailment <b>in</b> <b>System</b> Z, which <b>in</b> turn is weaker than probabilistic lexicographic entailment. Moreover, they all are weaker than entailment in probabilistic logic where default sentences are interpreted as strict sentences. Under natural conditions, probabilistic entailment <b>in</b> <b>System</b> Z and lexicographic entailment even coincide with such entailment in probabilistic logic, while probabilistic entailment <b>in</b> <b>System</b> P does not. Finally, we also present algorithms for reasoning under probabilistic entailment <b>in</b> <b>System</b> Z and probabilistic lexicographic entailment, and we give a precise picture of its complexity...|$|R
