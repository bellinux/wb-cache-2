5|$|In 1925, Scottish artist William Alister Macdonald (1861-1948) {{painted a}} {{portrait}} of the former King <b>in</b> <b>later</b> <b>life.</b> According to most sources, Teuruarii IV died in 1933, although his appointment as honorary chief of Rurutu was dated one year after.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>later</b> <b>life</b> Clark {{continued}} {{to struggle with}} alcohol abuse, a problem which had plagued him on-and-off for many years. He also remained bitter about his treatment and neglect by Virginia, and blamed it for his financial misfortune.|$|E

5|$|Bethe {{was born}} in Strasbourg, which was then part of Germany, on July 2, 1906, {{the only child of}} Anna (née Kuhn) and Albrecht Bethe, a privatdozent of {{physiology}} at the University of Strasbourg.

Despite having a religious background, he was not religious <b>in</b> <b>later</b> <b>life,</b> and described himself as an atheist.|$|E
5|$|Bottomley {{was born}} on 23 March 1860, at 16 Saint Peter's Street, Bethnal Green in London, the second child and only son of William Bottomley, a tailor's cutter, and Elizabeth, née Holyoake. William Bottomley's {{background}} is obscure, but Elizabeth belonged to a family of well-known radical agitators—her brother George Jacob Holyoake was {{a founder of the}} Secularist movement and <b>in</b> <b>later</b> <b>life</b> a leading figure in the growth of Co-operative societies. Among Holyoake's close associates was Charles Bradlaugh, who founded the National Republican League and became a controversial Member of Parliament. A longstanding friendship between Bradlaugh and Elizabeth Holyoake led to rumours that he, not William Bottomley, was Horatio's biological father—a suggestion that Bottomley, <b>in</b> <b>later</b> <b>life,</b> was prone to encourage. The evidence is circumstantial, mainly based on the marked facial resemblance between Bradlaugh and Bottomley.|$|E
5|$|Domitian was {{allegedly}} extremely sensitive regarding his baldness, which he disguised <b>in</b> <b>later</b> <b>life</b> by wearing wigs. According to Suetonius, he even {{wrote a book}} on the subject of hair care. With regard to Domitian's personality, however, the account of Suetonius alternates sharply between portraying Domitian as the emperor-tyrant, a man both physically and intellectually lazy, and the intelligent, refined personality drawn elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Enlisting in the Union Navy in 1864, {{he served}} as sailor aboard the USS Vandalia and the {{captured}} Confederate vessel USS Beauregard, maintaining the blockade of the ports of the Confederacy. He was discharged from service in 1865 after receiving an injury, which developed into a chronic condition <b>in</b> <b>later</b> <b>life.</b> Unable to immediately return home, the impoverished Bush {{took more than a}} decade to return to Hawaii, journeying through New England and much of the Pacific. Back in Hawaii, he worked as a government tax collector and road supervisor for the island of Kauai, where he settled down. <b>In</b> <b>later</b> <b>life</b> he converted to Mormonism and became {{an active member of the}} Hawaiian Mission. After the annexation of Hawaii to the United States, Bush was recognized for his service and granted a government pension in 1905 for the injuries he received in the Navy.

The following year he began law studies at the University of Otago. He also joined the Territorial Force.|$|E
5|$|He {{could not}} breathe {{for the first}} twenty minutes of his life. It is {{suggested}} that this deprivation may have caused him to develop Asperger's syndrome—some of his biographers, such as Mitchell Snay, maintain that this condition would account for his eccentric behaviors <b>in</b> <b>later</b> <b>life.</b> He was of English descent, and his forebears included early settlers of Massachusetts and New Hampshire.|$|E
