5|$|Landing safely on the Moon, {{the astronomers}} {{get out of}} the capsule (without the need of space suits) and watch the Earth rise in the distance. Exhausted by their journey, they unroll their {{blankets}} and sleep. As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star, old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella; it promptly takes root and turns into a <b>giant</b> <b>mushroom</b> itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} {{is set on}} the island of Solstheim, located off the north coast of Morrowind. Solstheim was a territory belonging to Skyrim until the High King gave the island to Morrowind to serve as a refuge for the Dunmer fleeing Morrowind after the eruption of the Red Mountain. Geographically, half of Solstheim is similar to northern Skyrim, covered in icy glaciers and snow. The other half is barren, and covered in ash following the Red Mountain disaster. The island's settlements and buildings also reflect the differing cultures, with the Nordic half of the land featuring architecture similar to Skyrim's. The rest of the island follows a Dunmeri architectural style, even containing a <b>giant</b> <b>mushroom</b> transformed into a house. The island's main settlement, Raven Rock, is governed by House Redoran, one of five Great Houses who rule over Morrowind.|$|E
500|$|The episode's main antagonist, {{the field}} mushroom, {{was met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews from critics, with a few detractors. Connie Ogle from PopMatters ranked the [...] "giant underground mushroom thingie" [...] among the [...] "best" [...] monster-of-the-week, describing it as [...] "too crafty to end up on a pizza". Timothy Sexton from Yahoo! Voices named [...] "The Giant Mushroom" [...] as one of [...] "The Best X-Files Monsters of the Week", writing, [...] "In the X-Files episode Field Trip things are simply not what they seem. [...] But when I claim that a <b>giant</b> <b>mushroom</b> {{is one of the}} most memorable X-Files monsters of the week, you can bet I'm being serious". Not all reviews were so positive. Cyriaque Lamar from i09 called the mushroom one of [...] "The 10 Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters" [...] and wrote, [...] "Mulder and Scully conquer this mycological nightmare by jointly fighting it during a drug trip — some real astral plane shit, brah. Love the 1990s CGI".|$|E

60|$|Harz {{took the}} proffered weed, and lighted {{it from the}} glowing tip of Mr. Treffry's cigar, by light of which his head and hat looked like some <b>giant</b> <b>mushroom.</b> Suddenly the wheels jolted on a rubble of loose stones; the {{carriage}} was swung sideways.

5000|$|The book blends {{passages}} on {{the nature}} of physical phenomena, such as gravity and volcanoes, with spiritualist speculation and adventure-story elements (like traversing a landscape of <b>giant</b> <b>mushrooms).</b> The whole ends with a summary letter from [...] "I-Am-The-Man" [...] and a conclusion from Drury. Subsequent editions of the book added various prefatory and supplementary materials.|$|R
50|$|The Beastlands is a {{plane of}} nature and animals, and {{is also known as}} the Happy Hunting Grounds. Peaceful alpine forests and groves of <b>giant</b> <b>mushrooms</b> can be found here.

The number of traditional settlements is very small, with most inhabitants living beneath the trees out in the wilderness.|$|R
5000|$|By 1956, lampshades and pillboxes {{were said}} to be {{overtaking}} the previously popular mushroom and cartwheel designs at Ascot races. A reviewer of the opening day's fashions noted: [...] "1956 must be dismissed as an unspectacular year. Gone were the cartwheels and <b>giant</b> <b>mushrooms</b> of other years, and in their place were pill-boxes (Princess Margaret), lampshades (Princess Alexandra) and various derivations of the beret".|$|R
60|$|After {{walking a}} mile or two farther, they found that the shore was {{beginning}} to be formally embanked, so as to form something like a parade; the ugly lamp-posts became less few and far between and more ornamental, though quite equally ugly. Half a mile farther on Father Brown was puzzled first by little labyrinths of flowerless flower-pots, covered with the low, flat, quiet-coloured plants that look less like a garden than a tessellated pavement, between weak curly paths studded with seats with curly backs. He faintly sniffed the atmosphere of a certain sort of seaside town that he did not specially care about, and, looking ahead along the parade by the sea, he saw something that put the matter beyond a doubt. In the grey distance the big bandstand of a watering-place stood up like a <b>giant</b> <b>mushroom</b> with six legs.|$|E

An {{eccentric}} scientist inventor {{and colleague}} to Professor Sharp, Dr. Fish consistently creates devices with unusual functions, including foodstuff that grants enhanced intelligence, {{a device that}} gives people the ability to recreate famous works of art, an animatronic theme park, and a device capable of generating <b>giant</b> <b>mushrooms.</b> These quirky inventions often put him in crossfire between the Bionic Six and Scarab's group. Dr. Fish was voiced by Howard Morris.|$|R
50|$|The {{area around}} Melnik is strikingly eroded, {{particularly}} the enormous area of cliff {{that serves as}} a backdrop to the town. This area, covering some 17 km² near Melnik, Kurlanovo and Rozhen, has been called the Melnik Badlands. The hills in this area can rise up to 100 m high. The unique formations, which can resemble <b>giant</b> <b>mushrooms,</b> ancient towers, and obelisks, were formed when heavy rain eroded the sand and clay the hills are composed of.|$|R

50|$|The explorers {{eventually}} {{come upon a}} subterranean ocean. They construct a raft from the stems of <b>giant</b> <b>mushrooms</b> to cross it, but not before narrowly escaping a family of dimetrodons. Their raft begins circling in a mid-ocean whirlpool. The professor deduces that {{this must be the}} center of the Earth because the magnetic forces from north and south meeting there are strong enough to snatch away even gold in the form of wedding rings and tooth fillings. Completely exhausted, they reach the opposite shore.|$|R

5000|$|After {{descending}} many miles, {{following the}} course of the Hansbach, they reach an unimaginably vast cavern. This underground world is lit by electrically charged gas at the ceiling, and is filled with a very deep subterranean ocean, surrounded by a rocky coastline covered in petrified trees and <b>giant</b> <b>mushrooms.</b> The travelers build a raft out of trees and set sail. The Professor names this sea the [...] "Lidenbrock Sea" [...] and the port as [...] "Port Gräuben", after the name of his goddaughter. While on the water, they see several prehistoric creatures such as a giant Ichthyosaurus, which fights with a Plesiosaurus and wins. After the battle between the monsters, the party comes across an island with a huge geyser, which Lidenbrock names [...] "Axel Island".|$|R
50|$|The Bunnet Stane (or bonnet stone) is a rock {{formation}} {{near the}} hamlet of Gateside in Fife.

5000|$|The {{structure}} {{consists of}} six parasols {{in the form}} of <b>giant</b> <b>mushrooms</b> ("Las setas" [...] in Spanish), whose design is inspired by the vaults of the Cathedral of Seville and the ficus trees in the nearby Plaza de Cristo de Burgos. Metropol Parasol is organized in four levels. The underground level (Level 0) houses the Antiquarium, where Roman and Moorish remains discovered on site are displayed in a museum. Level 1 (street level) is the Central Market. The roof of Level 1 is the surface of the open-air public plaza, shaded by the wooden parasols above and designed for public events.

Various scenes from the film are shown in succession, before Lavigne is reintroduced running toward {{an opening in the}} forest. As she exits the forest, she is dressed in her normal clothing.|$|R
