40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to formulate a comprehensive scaling up technique for designing of pneumatic conveying systems by addressing the whole pipeline together with all accessories. Five different bulk materials together with five qualities of one of these materials have been used for the tests. A large number of pneumatic conveying tests has been conducted for five different pipeline configurations. In order to develop a model for pressure drop prediction in different sections of pipeline i. e., horizontal, vertical, <b>bends,</b> <b>valves,</b> etc, the gas-solid flow has been considered to be a mixture having its own flow characteristics. The classical Darcy-Weisbach’s equation has been suitably modified and used for prediction of pressure drop of gas-solid mixture. The concept of suspension density and pressure drop coefficient has been introduced. Two separate models for pressure drop determination have been proposed. While one is used for both horizontal and vertical straight pipe sections, other is used for <b>bends,</b> <b>valves</b> or any other pipe section, whic...|$|R

40|$|Knot {{strength}} {{is very important}} in processing ropes than other textile products. Thus <b>double</b> sheet <b>bends</b> are usually used in rope mills, because their knots are small and strong in order to tie two threads of yarn. These knots have been made by manual operation. These mills, therefore, are demanding {{to be able to make}} these knots automatically in order to improve process efficiency. In this study, we have developed a knotter which is able to form a <b>double</b> sheet <b>bend</b> by using a set of molds. First, we designed a path to carve tracks on the surface of the mold by using the Dowker notation. But this path was too complicated to thread yarn through the path easily. Furthermore, it is desired that the knotter can be carried by a worker in rope mills. We, therefore, have moved and/or composed paths in order to obtain the simpler path for <b>double</b> sheet <b>bends.</b> Finally, we have integrated these molds and instruments such as air cylinders and linear guide ways in order to make a <b>double</b> sheet <b>bend</b> knot automatically. © 2008 The Textile Machinery Society of Japan...|$|R

40|$|The As Pontes basin (12 km 2), NW Iberian Peninsula, is {{bounded by}} a <b>double</b> {{restraining}} <b>bend</b> of a dextral strike-slip fault, which {{is related to}} the western onshore end of the Pyrenean belt. Surface and subsurface data obtained from intensive coal exploration and mining in the basin since the 1960 s together with additional structural and stratigraphic sequence analysis allowed us to determine the geometric relationships between tectonic structures and stratigraphic markers. The small size of the basin and the large amount of quality data make the As Pontes basin a unique natural laboratory for improving our understanding of the origin and evolution of restraining <b>bends.</b> The <b>double</b> restraining <b>bend</b> is the end stage of the structural evolution of a compressive underlapping stepover, where the basin was formed. During the first stage (stepover stage), which began ca. 30 Ma ago (latest Rupelian) and lasted 3. 4 My, two small isolated basins bounded by thrusts and normal faults were formed. For 1. 3 My, the strike-slip faults, which defined the stepover, grew towards each other until joining and forming the <b>double</b> restraining <b>bend,</b> which bounds one large As Pontes basin (transition stage).
