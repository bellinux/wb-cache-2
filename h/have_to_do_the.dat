500|$|During production, Benson felt one {{recording}} {{session with}} Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf {{went beyond the}} ordinary {{to the point where}} he left the recording room and told Powell [...] "You have to go out there, and you and her do this because you're coming to God right now in front of my eyes. You guys handle it". According to Benson, both he and Mosley were moved to tears by the session and Benson felt that something like that does not happen often in a recording studio. In a separate session with Mosley, bassist Tai Anderson said that, after recording the end of the song [...] "Run to You", Mosley said she could not believe she was recording with the band. Concerned that Mosley might have been pressured by her management team into doing the collaboration, Anderson said they told Mosley that she didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> recording. Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band's music had helped her during a difficult period in her teenage years.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to her work on The Simpsons, Cartwright has voiced many other characters on several animated series, including Chuckie Finster in Rugrats and All Grown Up!, Margo Sherman in The Critic, Mindy in Animaniacs, and Rufus the naked mole-rat in Kim Possible. For the role of Rufus, Cartwright researched mole-rats extensively, and became [...] "a font of useless trivia". She {{was nominated for a}} Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program in 2004 for her work on the show. In 2001, Cartwright took over the Rugrats role of Chuckie Finster when Christine Cavanaugh retired. Cartwright describes Rufus and Chuckie as her two most difficult voices: [...] "Rufus because my diaphragm gets a workout while trying to utilize the 18 vocal sounds a mole makes. Chuckie because... he's an asthmatic with five personalities rolled into one—plus I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> voice the way [...] did it for 10 years." [...] Other television shows that have used her voice work include Galaxy High, God, the Devil and Bob, Goof Troop, Mike, Lu & Og, The Replacements, Pinky and the Brain and Timberwolf. Cartwright has appeared on camera in numerous television shows and films, including Fame, Empty Nest, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Flesh and Blood, Godzilla, and 24.|$|E
500|$|However, as is {{most often}} the case with film adaptations, {{differences}} do exist between the film and source material. Certain scenes from the book were cut from the film, such as a biology room scene where Bella's class does blood typing. Hardwicke explains, [...] "Well [...] almost 500 pages—you do <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> sweetened condensed milk version of that.... We already have two scenes in biology: the first time they're in there and then the second time when they connect. For a film, when you condense, you don't want to keep going back to the same setting over and over. So that's not in there." [...] The settings of certain conversations in the book were also changed to make the scenes more [...] "visually dynamic" [...] on-screen, such as Bella's revelation that she knows Edward is a vampire—this happens in a meadow in the film instead of in Edward's car as in the novel. A biology field trip scene is added to the film to condense the moments of Bella's frustration at trying to explain how Edward saved her from being crushed by a van. The villainous vampires are introduced earlier in the film than in the novel. Rosenberg said that [...] "you don't really see James and the other villains until to {{the last quarter of the}} book, which really won't work for a movie. You need that ominous tension right off the bat. We needed to see them and that impending danger from the start. And so I had to create back story for them, what they were up to, to flesh them out a bit as characters." [...] Rosenberg also combined some of the human high school students, with Lauren Mallory and Jessica Stanley in the novel becoming the character of Jessica in the film, and a [...] "compilation of a couple of different human characters" [...] becoming Eric Yorkie. About these variances from the book, Mooradian stated, [...] "I think we did a really judicious job of distilling [...] Our greatest critic, Stephenie Meyer, loves the screenplay, and that tells me that we made all the right choices in terms of what to keep and what to lose. Invariably, you're going to lose bits and pieces that certain members of the audience are going to desperately want to see, but there's just a reality that we're not making 'Twilight: The Book' the movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|Over {{that span}} of time, several other Jewish people sought refuge with the Macugowskis. Eventually, nine refugees, {{including}} {{a cousin of}} the Radzas, were packed inside. Much later, Burack's sister Miriam described their packed state to reporters: [...] "When one turned on his side, the others would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same. We were like sardines." [...] The Macugowskis would come down at night to bring bread, water, and a bucket for waste. The Radzas, despairing their situation, sometimes begged them for poisoned food or a gun to end their misery, but the Macugowskis refused. Burack later recalled that they insisted, [...] "As {{long as we are}} alive, we will save you. On one occasion, Jozef brought the family unleavened bread so they could observe the Jewish Passover.|$|E
2500|$|With a new line-up in 1991 {{and a new}} {{recording}} label, Miller retired {{the name}} Game Theory and chose to call his new group The Loud Family. Rolling Stone described this name as both [...] "a hip allusion to the mid-Seventies PBS series An American Family" [...] and [...] "a clever way to describe the sound and feel of the band. Either way, it's a great hook—smart, funny and instantly memorable. All of which, appropriately enough, are qualities shared by Miller's songs." [...] Miller later described his intended reality-show metaphor: [...] "Going through life {{is a lot like}} having cameras on you and you have to perform, but there's no script; you just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> normal kind of bumbling thing.

2500|$|Neither {{the quality}} of Bow's voice nor her Brooklyn accent was an issue to Bow, her fans, or Paramount. However, Bow, like Charlie Chaplin, Louise Brooks, and most other silent film stars, did not embrace the novelty: [...] "I hate talkies ... they're stiff and limiting. You {{lose a lot of}} your cuteness, because there's no chance for action, and action is the most {{important}} thing to me." [...] A visibly nervous Bow had to do a number of retakes in The Wild Party because her eyes kept wandering up to the microphone overhead. [...] "I can't buck progress [...]. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> best I can," [...] she said. In October 1929, Bow described her nerves as [...] "all shot", saying that she had reached [...] "the breaking point", and Photoplay cited reports of [...] "rows of bottles of sedatives" [...] by her bed.|$|E
2500|$|Non-discrimination. It has {{two major}} {{components:}} the most favoured nation (MFN) rule, {{and the national}} treatment policy. Both are embedded in the main WTO rules on goods, services, and intellectual property, but their precise scope and nature differ across these areas. The MFN rule requires that a WTO member must apply the same conditions on all trade with other WTO members, i.e. a WTO member has to grant the most favourable conditions under which it allows trade in a certain product type to all other WTO members. [...] "Grant someone a special favour and you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same for all other WTO members." [...] National treatment means that imported goods should be treated no less favourably than domestically produced goods (at least after the foreign goods have entered the market) and was introduced to tackle non-tariff barriers to trade (e.g. technical standards, security standards et al. discriminating against imported goods).|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} in each Scandinavian country was different. Norway and Denmark were NATO allies, Sweden {{held to the}} neutrality that had taken her through two world wars, and Finland were required to defer in its foreign policy to the Soviet power directly on its borders. Thus, in one set of these countries the governments themselves would build their own stay-behind nets, counting on activating them from exile {{to carry on the}} struggle. These nets had to be co-ordinated with NATO's plans, their radios had to be hooked to a future exile location, and the specialised equipment had to be secured from CIA and secretly cached in snowy hideouts for later use. In other set of countries, CIA would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> job alone or with, at best, [...] "unofficial" [...] local help, since the politics of those governments barred them from collaborating with NATO, and any exposure would arouse immediate protest from the local Communist press, Soviet diplomats and loyal Scandinavians who hoped that neutrality or nonalignment would allow them to slip through a World War III unharmed.|$|E

2500|$|Wong {{received}} {{an invitation to}} appear in Game of Death (死亡遊戲), but declined. He was scheduled to attend a screen test {{on the set of}} Enter the Dragon after Bruce Lee had finished shooting the film and was working on dubbing. Lee returned to Hong Kong from his last trip to the United States of America in late May 1973. Thus, Wong would have attended the screen test sometime in June 1973. Wong recalled, [...] "About two months before he (Bruce Lee) died he gave me a phone call ... After this he left Hong Kong to settle his film business. When he came back, he called me up and wanted me to participate in the making of Game of Death. He had also invited me to the studio to attend a screen test. I did not promise to act in the film, yet I still went to attend the screen test to please him." [...] In a 1986 interview, Wong said, [...] "I told him (Bruce Lee) that I didn't want to go and die in my first movie! ... I wasn't in dire financial straits at the time, so I didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> film (just) to make money." [...] The role of Lee's final opponent was thus played by basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. In another interview, Wong said, [...] "It was for Game of Death, but I declined because I thought that the moves of Wing Chun style wouldn’t look good on film. I think the Wing Chun method is ugly for movies but very good and very logical for real fighting." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, Bolland {{attended}} the British Comic Art Convention at the Waverley Hotel in London, and met [...] "a {{lot of the}} people who were key in the comics scene of the time," [...] including Dez Skinn, Nick Landau, Richard Burton, Angus McKie and – crucially – Dave Gibbons. Bolland and Gibbons became firm friends. After finishing his college course, Bolland was hit with [...] "the stark reality of unemployment" [...] and on the advice of Gibbons joined art agency Bardon Press Features. [...] "A few two-page strips" [...] for D.C. Thomson resulted, but Bolland would refer to this period as his [...] "lowest time." [...] Bardon did however produce a client called Pikin which was [...] "planning a bi-weekly comic about an African superhero," [...] Powerman, which was to be sold in Nigeria. Gibbons and Bolland were to draw alternate issues (Bolland's first issue was Powerman No. 2.), and Bolland recalls that [...] "soon Dave had drawn his entire story and I had produced just a few pages." [...] This knowledge – [...] "that Dave could produce a page a day... and that I was going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same" [...] – was a shock, but proved to be [...] "the very best kind of training ground." [...] With comics purportedly being new to Nigeria, Bolland recalls this work being created specifically to be [...] "really simple; six panels on a page and [...] the panels had to be numbered." [...] Not only was this work [...] "he best way to learn the simple rules of comic book storytelling," [...] but [...] "better still, it was going someplace where nobody I knew could see it." [...] He [...] "drew around 300 pages of that very straightforward, simple-to-follow work, and I guess the storytelling flowed naturally from that." [...] Even so, he [...] "was always struggling to get the last eight or ten pages finished," [...] and was occasionally helped by friends, both from his [...] "Norwich School of Art days," [...] Gibbons and future-2000 AD and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen artist Kevin O'Neill.|$|E
