The electrode comprises a series of INCONEL 690 tubes running above the melt across the melter interior and through the melter walls and having nickel cores inside the tubes beginning where the tubes leave the melter interior and nickel connectors to connect the tubes electrically in series. An applied voltage causes the tubes to generate heat of electrical resistance for <b>melting</b> <b>frit</b> injected onto the melt. The cores limit heat generated as the current passes through {{the walls of the}} melter.

A comprehensive energy balance for the same period showed that for each tonne of input material the potential recoverable energy was 405 kWh.

40|$|Suppose {{households}} {{increase the}} efficiency {{with which they}} use gas {{so that they can}} heat their homes to the same degree for the same time each day, but using less physical gas. This will reduce carbon emissions directly emitted by households. However, where households demand less gas, this will also reduce output requirements in the energy supply chain(see figure below). Thus, further reductions in emissions may be expected in the utility sectors themselves (gas, electricity and water supply) but also further up the supply chain, including the extraction of oil and gas and other sectors (service and industrial) within UK and overseas supply chains. Reflecting this argument, our project proposes use of a metric called a Carbon Saving Multiplier (CSM) that reports the total <b>kg</b> (or <b>tonne)</b> of carbon saved throughout the energy supply chain per <b>kg</b> (or <b>tonne)</b> directly saved within the household sector...|$|R
25|$|The {{final stage}} was to <b>melt</b> the <b>fritted</b> {{material}} in crucibles {{in a covered}} furnace to give molten glass. The furnace needed to operate at as high a temperature as possible since quick melting {{and the need for}} less flux improved the quality of glass. The change from natron to potash required an increase in melting temperature of about 200°C to around 1350°C, necessitating a fundamental change in furnace technology and the development of high-temperature ceramics. At this higher temperature, normal clay would react chemically with the glass.|$|R

Interface between the crucible and the frit was investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, Philips XL- 30 S FEG) equipped with EDS (Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy) unit, X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips X. Pert Pro), and Optical Microscope (OM, Nikon Eclipse L 150). Formation of a continuous band of zinc aluminate (gahnite) crystals was observed at the interface between the alumina crucible wall and the contained opaque and/or transparent <b>frit</b> <b>melt.</b> When opaque <b>frit</b> was used, isolated pockets of zirconia were present adjacent to the zinc aluminate band inside the frit. Deeper inside the frit incompletely dissolved zircon were observed. On the other hand zirconia crucible failed against both of the corrosive frits, resulting in complete penetration of frit species into zirconia crucible wall. Thermodynamic predictions based {{on the use of}} phase diagrams also produced similar conclusions with the practically observed results. Crucibles with 50 wt% zirconia and 50 wt% alumina were also manufactured and tested for their corrosion resistance against the frit.

30|$|Sealant {{materials}} like Surlyn® and Bynel® hotmelt foils {{are used}} in DSSCs to seal the cells [48]. Their sealing capability decreases when the pressure builds up inside the cell [51] and also if exposed within a cyclic or regular temperature variation [52].

Thus, it is required to increase their adhesion with glass by pretreatment of the glass with metal oxide particles. As an alternative, sealants based on low <b>melting</b> glass <b>frits</b> [53] were also developed which offer more stability than the hotmelt foils, but these sealants are not suitable for the large area module production.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} Al 2 O 3 {{additions}} on the compaction and sintering behaviour of a leadborosilicate glass (LG) have been investigated. LG powder was prepared by <b>melting,</b> <b>fritting</b> and milling {{a glass of}} the composition: 77 PbO, 10 B(2) O(3), 10 SiO(2), 2 Al(2) O(3) and IP 2 O 5 (wt. %). The mean particle sizes of the powders were: LG, 6. 5 mum and Al 2 O 3, 3. 3 mum The compaction behaviour of LG-Al 2 O 3 powder mixtures can be represented by a new compaction equation: [(D-g - D- 0) /(1 - D- 0) ] = (P/P-f) (n), where D-g is the relative green density, D- 0 the relative tap density and n and Pr are material constants. The exponent pi decreases from 0. 192 to 0. 065 as the Al 2 O 3 content is increased from 0 to 100 vol. %. The Frenkel equation for isothermal shrinkage {{has been found to}} be valid. It is shown that in the glass matrix composites the minimum sintering temperature can be determined by measuring the dilatometric deformation temperature. The presence of Al 2 O 3 in excess of 15 vol. % has been found to strongly retard the sintering kinetics. An addition of 45 vol. % Al 2 O 3 increases the activation energy for sintering from 67 to 112 kcal mol(- 1). The presence of Al 2 O 3 particles also induced a partial crystallisation in LG matrix.

40|$|Several wafer bond {{technologies}} like direct and anodic bonding without intermediate layer or thermo-compression wafer bonding with intermediate layers like low <b>melting</b> <b>frit</b> glasses, eutectic materials or polymers were {{developed during the}} last years and are nowadays extensively used in industrial applications. The paper will describe some important aspects of new Ti-Si and Laser assisted transmission Si to Si bonding techniques and their application for the fabrication of an ultrasonic transducer array. Main aspects for the reliability of wafer bonded devices are the yield after bonding, the bond strength and the hermeticity {{as well as the}} suitability for the packaging processes (e. g. moulding) and the influence of electrical and mechanical properties of the bonded elements by the bond process. The paper will focus on methods to characterize the bond strength and the hermeticity of bonded compounds. The main method to evaluate the bond strength is the micro chevron test. This test requires special designed test samples and is destructive, but also standard chips with bonded caps can be used for strength measurements. For anodic bonding between transparent glass and silicon a non destructive bond strength test structure can be used. This non-destructive test structure based on structure fabricated on one surface of the bond partners and has dimensions of several 10 to 100 mum. After the anodic bonding the length of the not bonded gap around this structure can be used to calculate the bond strength. The hermeticity can be tested by helium leakage test or by using resonant structure inside of the cavities which change the frequency depending on the pressure inside of the cavity...|$|R

40|$|Cattle paunch is {{comprised}} of partially digested cattle feed, containing mainly grass and grain and is a major waste produced at cattle slaughterhouses contributing 20 - 30 % of organic matter and 40 - 50 % of P waste produced on-site. In this work, Temperature Phased Anaerobic Digestion (TPAD) and struvite crystallization processes were developed at pilot-scale to recover methane energy and nutrients from paunch solid waste. The TPAD plant achieved a maximum sustainable organic loading rate of 1 - 1. 5 kgCOD m day using a feed solids concentration of approximately 3 %; this loading rate was limited by plant engineering and not the biology of the process. Organic solids destruction (60 %) and methane production (230 L CH kg VS) achieved in the plant were similar to levels predicted from laboratory biochemical methane potential (BMP) testing. Model based analysis identified {{no significant difference in}} batch laboratory parameters vs pilot-scale continuous parameters, and no change in speed or extent of degradation.
