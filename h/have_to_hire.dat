5|$|Trucking {{companies}} (motor carriers) {{can also}} play a role in HOS violations. Certain carriers may choose to knowingly ignore HOS violations made by their drivers, or even encourage their drivers to do so. Allowing drivers to violate the HOS is an effective cost-cutting measure used mostly by non-union, long haul carriers. Permitting HOS violations allows a carrier to hire fewer drivers, and run on fewer trucks than a company which follows the rules. To comply with the HOS, these companies would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> more drivers (possibly driving up wages) and purchase additional trucks and trailers. Making a change to comply with the law is complicated by competition with carriers that already comply with HOS regulations. Due to this competition, carriers who choose to switch from non-compliance could not pass on all of their increased costs associated with HOS compliance to their customers.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the railway linking the village of Zermatt {{from the town of}} Visp started in 1888. The first train reached Zermatt on July 18, 1891 and the entire line was electrified in 1930. Since 1930 the village is directly connected to St. Moritz by the Glacier Express panoramic train. However there is no connection with the village of Breuil-Cervinia on the Italian side. Travellers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> mountain guides to cross the 3,300 metres high glaciated Theodul Pass, separating the two resorts. The town of Zermatt remains almost completely free of internal combustion vehicles and can be reached by train only. (Apart from the local police service which uses a Volkswagen car, only electric vehicles are used locally).|$|E

2500|$|The {{number of}} priests, {{brothers}} and nuns dropped {{sharply in the}} 1960s and 1970s as many left and few replacements arrived. Catholic parochial schools had been [...] built primarily in the cities, with few in the suburbs or small towns. Many continue to operate, but {{with the loss of}} so many low-cost nuns, they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> much more expensive lay teachers. Most inner-city parishes saw [...] white flight to the suburbs, so by the 1990s the remaining schools often had a largely minority student body, which attracts upwardly mobile students away from the low-quality, high-violence free public schools.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 September 2007, Liberal Party {{national}} director Jamie Carroll sparked controversy when, during discussions about whether francophone Quebecers should be hired {{in order to}} appeal to francophone voters, he commented: [...] "Do we also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> people from the Chinese community to represent the Chinese community?" [...] Carroll argued that the comment {{was taken out of}} context, but it nevertheless raised the hackles of many Liberals in Quebec, prompting calls from MPs Pablo Rodriguez and Liza Frulla for Carroll to be fired. Stéphane Dion stood by Carroll's version of events and rejected calls for Carroll's dismissal. On 10 October, a Liberal press release announced Carroll's resignation and commended him for his [...] "loyalty to our leader and to our party".|$|E
2500|$|Albini {{believed}} that Big Black {{had nothing to}} gain by adopting the usual corporate trappings of rock bands: [...] "If you don't use contracts, you don't have any contracts to worry about. If you don't have a tour rider, you don't have a tour rider to argue about. If you don't have a booking agent, you don't have a booking agent to argue with." [...] Handling the tour booking, equipment hauling, setup, and breakdown of shows themselves also meant that the band did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> a booking agent or road crew with whom {{they would have to}} share profits. The lack of a drummer also meant one less member to split profits with, and since there was no drum kit the band did not have to rent a tour van to fit all of their equipment. Thus Big Black was able to profit from most of their tours. They embarked on a 1984 national tour of the United States in preparation for their forthcoming Homestead EP, utilizing the close-knit network of independent rock bands to learn of cities and venues to play.|$|E
