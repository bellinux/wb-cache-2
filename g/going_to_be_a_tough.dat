He also brought in Carl Muggleton (who was on loan last season), Keith Downing and John Dreyer. Everyone knew that the 1994-95 season was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> one and manager Jordan {{arranged}} a strenuous pre-season training camp in Scotland. The league programme started with a 1-0 victory over Tranmere Rovers but this was followed up with poor results which saw Stoke lose 4-0 back-to-back at Reading and then Bolton Wanderers. Shortly after that defeat at Bolton Jordan resigned which was unsurprising as he remained unpopular with the club's supporters.|$|E

It'll be difficult considering Scott has the advantage of losing zero pounds last week. Scott steps on the scale first and loses nine pounds, 3.36%. Damien needs 10 pounds to keep his comeback alive, but only loses two, 0.68%. Bob is sad to see him go, but is proud of Damien for losing 95 pounds.|$|E

5000|$|Olivera Kovačević, RTS {{television}} host, {{touched on}} the issue of potential Al Jazeera Balkans journalists from Serbia having to disregard their own country's constitution if the station's hiring criteria is to treat Kosovo as an independent state: [...] "The very act of asking that question during a job interview — thereby interrogating an applicant on his/her political orientation — is in breach of that person's human rights. I accept that every media outlet has an editorial policy, but no one can demand of me to ignore my country's laws and constitution that say Kosovo is part of Serbia. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> call for the broadcasting regulators in Serbia whether to allow an outlet with such policy to own a station that broadcasts nationally in Serbia".|$|E

Woodley controlled the fight with effective takedowns, and according to Compustrike, out struck Daley en route to a unanimous decision win. With the win, Woodley will likely fight for the vacant Strikeforce Welterweight Championship. “I verged to the left and avoided the iceberg,” Woodley told Showtime Sports shortly after the win. “I knew it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> fight....

The wicketkeeper batsman Riki Wessels also adds as an asset to their batting, with a few centuries in domestic cricket this season. The bowling, however, would not be the strong point for this side, with only Shapoor Zadran, Shahadat Hossain and Dolar Mahmud as recognised bowlers in the team. Young Nabil Samad has shown great potential with 11 five-wicket and two ten-wicket hauls in first class cricket, but the rest are yet to make a mark. On the bright side, these uncapped locals get their golden opportunity this season like Sanjamul Islam.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2006, Tim Beedle, {{a former}} {{associate}} editor of the English version Battle Royale, stated on the Tokyopop Messageboard the reasoning behind the decision to have a fairly loose adaptation:'Prior to starting work on the first volume of Battle Royale, its editor (Mark Paniccia, who has since left Tokyopop) made a decision to hire Keith Giffen, a well-known American comic book writer, to provide a much looser adaptation than usual. He made this decision for a variety of reasons, but two seemed to be more prominent than the rest. First, due to BR's extreme content and M rating, it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> sell. (Some of the large chains refuse to carry M-rated books.) Hiring a known writer could help compensate for this by driving sales. Second, more than any other book we were publishing at the time, BR had the potential to find a crossover audience in the direct market among American comic book readers, who often are adverse to trying manga.' ...|$|E
50|$|The {{team was}} in disarray in 2007, when changes were brought {{about in the}} offseason, with stalwart Aussie Craig Stewart taking over as team President, as well as Coach. Yoni Moussadji took over the club {{financials}} and an {{emphasis was placed on}} securing new sponsorship as well as recruiting new players. Right from the start, however, the 2008 season was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> one on the field as the Dingos lost several of their veteran Canadians, with Bryan Wells, Chris Ritchie, and Andrew Nisker each finally saying goodbye to the club after many years and multiple premiereships. Their loss showed on the field and the Dingos struggled. The low point of the season may have come in Week 11, when only 13 players were available to make the trip to Hamilton and the Dingos were soundly thrashed by almost 100 points, the first time they had lost to the Wildcats in years. The Dingos barely put up a fight in their final two games of the season and missed the Finals for only the 2nd time in their history, finishing the season 4-9.|$|E
