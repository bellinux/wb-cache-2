40|$|Abstract. Global to {{regional}} datasets from coarse spatial resolution satellite sensors are increasingly becoming available. Land cover and vegetation extent maps {{are among the}} terrestrial products derived from such data. Whilst they provide a previously unavailable synoptic view of global situations, accuracy assessment methodological issues are often ignored when creating these digital databases or producing statistics from such sources. This paper looks at how these issues are addressed {{in the framework of}} the Joint Research Centre’s TREES (Tropical Ecosystem Environment observation <b>by</b> <b>Satellite)</b> <b>project,</b> initiated to map and monitor the pan-tropical humid forest belt using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} role of robotic telescopes in <b>satellite</b> <b>projects,</b> as well as related strategies. Most <b>satellite</b> <b>projects</b> in space {{astrophysics}} focus on high-energy astrophysics from X-rays to gamma-rays. A large fraction of objects of high-energy astrophysics emit also optical light, which is, in many cases, variable. The observation of these sources at optical wavelengths can provide valuable inputs for multispectral analysis of various categories of celestial high-energy (HE) sources. As the magnitudes of numerous objects are bright and can be hence accessed by robotic ground-based observatories, these observations can contribute to investigations and analyses of HE sources. We discuss in detail this possible contribution, with emphasis on the ESA INTEGRAL mission. In addition to this, there are also <b>satellite</b> <b>projects</b> outside the high-energy astronomy, in which the robotic telescopes can also play an important role. We will illustrate this on {{the example of the}} ESA satellite Gaia. In this project, robotic telescopes are expected not only to verify the triggers detected <b>by</b> <b>satellite</b> (such as transients and flares) but also to provide additional (mostly photometric) data for better scientific cases...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a concept {{for the test}} and evaluation of automation, robotics and machine intelligence (commonly referred to as artificial intelligence (AI)) for command and control of space systems.

Several reasons for this "non-acceptance" exist, but one reason is seen as being paramount. The risk factor in using AI tools is much too high. The space industry routinely tests spacecraft hardware and software to reduce risk, and has invested significant capital developing special facilites to certify that a spacecraft is mission ready. Until now, no such facility was available for testing AI tools and applications, until the development of the Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL).

40|$|In our {{comments}} we explicitly {{acknowledge the}} attempt of Hansen et al. to assess various uncertainties inherent in geophysical data being based on different measuring concepts and observation methods. However, {{with regard to}} the planetary energy budget, this paper offers some vulnerable points. We will focus our comments on these vulnerable points only. We will show that the energy imbalance of the entire Earth-atmosphere system is, indeed, based on these inherent uncertainties. We will demonstrate that the accuracy in the quantification of the global energy flux budget as claimed by Hansen et al. is, by far, not achievable in case of the entire Earth-atmosphere system. Using the value of the solar constant of S_ 0 = 1361 W/m^ 2 recently determined on the basis of total-solar-irradiance (TSI) observation <b>by</b> three different <b>satellite</b> <b>projects</b> (ACRIMSAT/ACRIM 3 launched in 2000, SORCE/TIM launched in 2003, and PICARD/PREMOS launched in 2010) we will document that the planetary energy imbalance of F = 0. 58 +/- 0. 15 W/m^ 2 calculated by Hansen et al. does not exist. Consequently, the implications related to this planetary energy imbalance have no basis. Comment: 30 pages, 1 table, and 8 figures, submitted to Atmospheric Chemistry and Physic...|$|R
40|$|With the {{successful}} launch and official commissioning of China's first dynamic ocean environment satellite Haiyang- 2 (HY- 2), China's capabilities for oceanic environment monitoring and oceanic resource detecting have been further improved and enhanced. Precise tracking and orbit determination {{are not only}} key technical concerns in the ocean dynamic environment <b>satellite</b> <b>project</b> but also necessary conditions for carrying out related oceanic science research using observational data obtained using spaceborne instruments including radar altimeter. In this study, the current available status of international satellite laser ranging (SLR) monitoring on HY- 2 was introduced. Six-months of SLR data from HY- 2 were processed to obtain precise satellite orbit information using the dynamic orbit determination method. We carried out a detailed assessment of the SLR orbit accuracy by internal evaluation, comparisons with the orbit derived by the French Doppler orbitography and radio-positioning integrated <b>by</b> <b>satellite</b> (DORIS) system, and station-satellite distance validation. These assessments indicate that the three-dimensional orbital accuracy of HY- 2 is about 12. 5 cm, and the radial accuracy is better than 3 cm.

40|$|In {{order to}} ensure reentering {{spacecraft}} do not pose an undue risk to the Earth's population {{it is important to}} design satellites and rocket bodies with end of life considerations in mind. In addition to considering the possible consequences of deorbiting a vehicle, consideration must also be given to the possible risks associated with a vehicle failing to become operational or reach its intended orbit. Based on recovered space debris and numerous reentry survivability analyses, fuel tanks are of particular concern in both of these considerations. Most spacecraft utilize some type of fuel tank as part of their propulsion system. These fuel tanks are most often constructed using stainless steel or titanium and are filled with potentially hazardous substances such as hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide. For a vehicle which has reached its scheduled end of mission the contents of the tanks are typically depleted. In this scenario the use of stainless steel and titanium results in the tanks posing a risk to people and property do to the high melting point and large heat of ablation of these materials leading to likely survival of the tank during reentry. If {{a large portion of the}} fuel is not depleted prior to reentry, there is the added risk of hazardous substance being released when the tank impact the ground. This paper presents a discussion of proactive methods which have been utilized <b>by</b> NASA <b>satellite</b> <b>projects</b> to address the risks associated with fuel tanks reentering the atmosphere. In particular it will address the design of a demiseable fuel tank as well as the evaluation of off the shelf designs which are selected to burst during reentry...|$|R
