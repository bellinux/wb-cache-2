Despite its title, The Art of War addresses strategy in a broad fashion, touching upon public administration and planning. The text outlines theories of battle, but also advocates diplomacy and the cultivation of relationships with other nations as essential to the <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> state.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} team envisioned Japanese cities as entities, who require physical agents to execute their will and regulate the activities within them. The concept behind the <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> city {{is based on}} traditional Chinese medicine in which the smooth flow of a body's fluids nourishes its internal organs. The team equates yōkai with qi, humans with water, and agents of the city (karas) with blood. They integrated Celtic mythology into their concept for further symbolisms, treating the city as the male (yang); and , the manifestation of its will as female (yin). In contrast, their theory treats the humans and agents as {{the children of the}} city and its will, and classifies them as the reproduction system's five major organs. Following the team's vision, the mikuras (evil yōkai) represent the five elements in this system. This idea forms the basis of the relationship between cities and their inhabitants in the show.|$|E
5|$|The river {{flows through}} the South Downs, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and since 2011, a {{designated}} national park. There are two large aquifers in the area, one consisting of chalk, {{to the south of}} the river valley, and the other the Lower Greensand Group, underlying the whole of the river. The aquifers are separated by a Gault Formation, which consists of clay. At {{the western edge of the}} region, both the chalk and the gault turn to the north, creating a scarp slope. The base flow of the river consists of water from the Lower Greensand aquifer, and from springs along the bottom of the chalk scarp slope. These help to maintain the flows in the river during the summer months, although there have been significant periods where flows have been low, notably in the drought of the early 1990s, and again in 1995/96. These led to declines in the populations of the macro-invertebrates which are used to measure the <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> river, but these have subsequently recovered. In order to monitor the hydrology, the Environment Agency has a series of observation boreholes along the valley, and maintains gauging stations at Princes Marsh, close to the source, at Iping Mill, at Halfway Bridge on the River Lod just above its junction with the Rother, and at Hardham, just before the river joins the Arun.|$|E

40|$|When {{considering}} tree health, it {{is important}} to remember that tree health and forest health are not the same thing.

25|$|Maximizing total {{benefits}} or utilitarianism {{can be accomplished}} by saving the most lives or by prognosis (life years).

25|$|The {{fact that}} the {{relationship}} between income and health is concave indicates that a transfer of income from the rich to the poor would increase the average <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> society. However, this policy prescription will have this effect only if the relationship between income and health is causal– i.e. if higher income causes longer life expectancy (see below). If the relationship is driven by other factors, if it is spurious, or if it is in fact health that leads to higher income, then this policy outcome will no longer be true.|$|E

25|$|In ancient India, {{according}} to the Ayurvedic medical systems, the kidneys were considered {{the beginning of the}} excursion channels system, the 'head' of the Mutra Srotas, receiving from all other systems, and therefore important in determining a person's health balance and temperament by the balance and mixture of the three 'Dosha's – the three health elements: Vatha (or Vata) – air, Pitta – bile, and Kapha – mucus.

25|$|It is not {{yet clear}} whether or not {{vitamins}} and supplements should be administered in dogs—opinions among veterinarians vary widely.

According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), dogs receive a complete and balanced diet from the commercially processed dog food alone. Pet owners who give their dogs homemade diets may incorporate extra vitamins and supplements.|$|E
25|$|Proponents {{of naked}} credit default swaps say that short selling in various forms, whether credit default swaps, options or futures, has the {{beneficial}} effect of increasing liquidity in the marketplace. That benefits hedging activities. Without speculators {{buying and selling}} naked CDSs, banks wanting to hedge might not find a ready seller of protection. Speculators also create a more competitive marketplace, keeping prices down for hedgers.

25|$|By {{identifying}} {{risk factors}} present {{within a community}} and creating solutions to decrease the incidence of injury, trauma referral systems may help to enhance the overall <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> population. Injury prevention strategies are commonly used to prevent injuries in children, who are a high risk population. Injury prevention strategies generally involve educating the general public about specific risk factors and developing strategies to avoid or reduce injuries. Legislation intended to prevent injury typically involves seatbelts, child car-seats, helmets, alcohol control, and increased enforcement of the legislation. Other controllable factors, {{such as the use}} of drugs including alcohol or cocaine, increases the risk of trauma by increasing the likelihood of traffic collisions, violence, and abuse occurring. Prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines may increase the risk of trauma in elderly people.|$|E
25|$|Small trees {{grown in}} containers, like bonsai, require {{specialized}} care. Unlike most houseplants, flowering shrubs, and other subjects of container gardening, tree {{species in the}} wild generally grow individual roots up to several meters long and root structures encompassing {{hundreds or thousands of}} liters of soil. In contrast, a typical bonsai container allows a fraction of a meter for root extension, and holds 2 to 10 liters of soil and root mass. Branch and leaf (or needle) growth in trees is also large-scale in nature. Wild trees typically grow 5 meters or taller when mature, while the largest bonsai rarely exceed 1 meter and most specimens are significantly smaller. These size differences affect maturation, transpiration, nutrition, pest resistance, and many other aspects of tree biology. Maintaining the long-term <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tree in a container requires a number of specialized care techniques.|$|E
25|$|Psychotherapy is an interpersonal, {{relational}} intervention used {{by trained}} psychotherapists to aid s in problems of living. This usually includes increasing individual {{sense of well-being}} and reducing subjective discomforting experience. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, dialogue, communication and behavior change and {{that are designed to}} improve the mental <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> client or patient, or to improve group relationships (such as in a family). Most forms of psychotherapy use only spoken conversation, though some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, art, drama, narrative story, or therapeutic touch. Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained therapist and client(s). Purposeful, theoretically based psychotherapy began in the 19th century with psychoanalysis; since then, scores of other approaches have been developed and continue to be created.|$|E

50|$|An {{indicator}} species has <b>a</b> narrow set <b>of</b> ecological requirements, therefore they become useful targets for observing the <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ecosystem. Some animals, such as amphibians with their semi-permeable skin and linkages to wetlands, have an acute sensitivity to environmental harm and thus {{may serve as}} a miner's canary. Indicator species are monitored in an effort to capture environmental degradation through pollution or some other link to proximate human activities. Monitoring an {{indicator species}} is a measure to determine if there is a significant environmental impact that can serve to advise or modify practice, such as through different forest silviculture treatments and management scenarios, or to measure the degree <b>of</b> harm that <b>a</b> pesticide may impart on the <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ecosystem.|$|R
