With increasing high performance computing capacities copying raw data to a dedicated visualization cluster becomes too expensive. Therefore, insitu approaches using same compute resources are required. Cut-planes became a common visualization tool in order to analyze complex three-dimensional scalar fields. Within this method, interesting regions are sliced {{with one or more}} planes on which the intersected scalar field is represented. To explore the whole dataset, cut-planes need to be moved around interactively which requires high update rates. Typical cut-plane algorithms process all cells crossed by the plane resulting in high extraction times and output sizes. In order to provide guaranteed response times we use a progressive sampling scheme instead. By sampling the cut-plane at distinct positions the presented methods are independent of the cell count in the affected region.

40|$|International audienceThe {{advent of}} {{computer}} augmented reality (CAR), in which computer generated objects mix with real video images, {{has resulted in}} many interesting new application domains. Providing common illumination between the real and synthetic objects can be very beneficial, since the additional visual cues (shadows, interreflections etc.) are critical to seamless real-synthetic world integration. Building on recent advances in computer graphics and computer vision, we present a new framework to resolving this problem. We address three specific aspects of the common illumination problem for CAR: (a) simplification of camera calibration and modeling of the real scene; (b) efficient update of illumination for moving CG objects and (c) efficient rendering of the merged world. A first working system is presented for a limited sub-problem: a static real scene and camera with moving CG objects. Novel advances in computer vision are used for camera calibration and user-friendly modeling of the real scene, a recent interactive radiosity update algorithm is adapted to provide fast illumination update and finally textured polygons are used for display.

We show that the size k of the complex is (n) and O(n 4) and we give an output sensitive algorithm to build it in time O((n 3 + k) log n). This theoretical work has already been used to define a practical data-structure, the Visibility Skeleton described in a companion paper. Interactively manipulating the geometry of complex, globally illuminated scenes has to date proven an elusive goal. Previous attempts have failed to provide interactive updates of global illumination and {{have not been able to}} offer well-adapted algorithms controlling the frame rate.

40|$|A {{difficult}} {{challenge in}} geometrical acoustic modeling is computing propagation paths from sound sources to receivers fast enough for interactive applications. We paper describe a beam tracing method that enables <b>interactive</b> <b>updates</b> of propagation paths from a stationary source to a moving receiver.

Then, during an interactive phase, we use the precomputed beam trees to generate propagation paths from the source(s) to any receiver location at interactive rates. The key features of our beam tracing method are: 1) it scales to support large architectural environments, 2) it models propagation due to wedge diffraction, 3) it finds all propagation paths up to a given termination criterion without exhaustive search or risk of under-sampling, and 4) it updates propagation paths at interactive rates.

As an alternative, we present an interactive system to virtually modify the lighting and geometry of scenes with both real and synthetic objects, including mixed real/virtual lighting and shadows. In our method, real scene geometry is first approximately reconstructed from photographs. Additional images are taken from a single viewpoint with a real light in different positions to estimate reflectance. A filtering process is used to compensate for inaccuracies, and per image reflectances are averaged to generate an approximate reflectance image for the given viewpoint, removing shadows in the process. This estimate is used to initialise a global illumination hierarchical radiosity system, representing real-world secondary illumination; the system is optimized for <b>interactive</b> <b>updates.</b> Direct illumination from lights is calculated separately using ray-casting and a table for efficient reuse of data where appro-priate.

40|$|The Cascade Sand {{zone of the}} Mission-Visco Lease in the Cascade Oil {{field of}} Los Angeles County, California, has been under water flood since 1970. Increasing water {{injection}} to increase oil production rates was being considered {{as an opportunity to}} improve oil recovery. However, a secondary gas cap had formed in the up-dip portion of the reservoir with very low gas cap pressures, creating concern that oil could be displaced into the gas cap resulting in the loss of recoverable oil. Therefore, injecting gas into the gas cap to keep the gas cap pressurized and restrict the influx of oil during water injection was also being considered. Further, it was recognized that the reservoir geology in the gas cap area is very complex with numerous folding and faulting and thus there are potential pressure barriers in several locations throughout the reservoir. With these conditions in mind, there were concerns regarding well to well continuity in the gas cap, which could interfere with the intended repressurization impact. Concerns about the pattern of gas flow from well to well, the possibilities of cycling gas without the desired increased pressure, and the possible loss of oil displaced into the gas cap resulted in the decision to conduct a gas tracer survey in an attempt to better define inter-well communication. Following the gas tracer survey, a reservoir model would be developed to integrate the findings of the gas tracer survey, known geologic and reservoir data, and historic production data. The reservoir model would be used to better define the reservoir characteristics and provide information that could help optimize the waterflood-gas injection project under consideration for efficient water and gas injection management to increase oil production. However, due to inadequate gas sampling procedures in the field and insufficiently developed laboratory analytical techniques, the laboratory was unable to detect the tracer in the gas samples taken. At that point, focus on, and an expansion of the scope of the reservoir simulation and modeling effort was initiated, using DOE's BOAST 98 (a visual, dynamic, <b>interactive</b> <b>update</b> of BOAST 3), 3 D, black oil reservoir simulation package as the basis for developing the reservoir model. Reservoir characterization, modeling, and reservoir simulation resulted in a significant change in the depletion strategy. Information from the reservoir characterization and modeling effort indicate that in-fill drilling and relying on natural water influx from the aquifer could increase remaining reserves by 125, 000 barrels of oil per well, and that up to 10 infill wells could be drilled in the field. Through this scenario, field production could be increased two to three times over the current 65 bopd. Based on the results of the study, permits have been applied for to drill a directional infill well to encounter the productive zone at a high angle in order to maximize the amount of pay and reservoirs encountered...|$|E

High quality walkthrough {{rendering of}} static scenes with penumbra {{can be achieved}} using pre-calculated discontinuity meshes, which provide a triangulation well adapted to penumbral boundaries, and backprojections which provide exact illumination computation at vertices very efficiently. However, recomputation of the complete mesh and backprojection structures at each frame is prohibitively expensive in environments with changing geometry. This recomputation would in any case be wasteful: only a limited part of these structures actually needs to be recalculated. We present a novel algorithm which uses spatial coherence of movement {{as well as the}} rich visibility information existing in the discontinuity mesh to avoid unnecessary recomputation after object motion. In particular we isolate all modifications required for the update of the discontinuity mesh by using an augmented spatial subdivision structure and we restrict intersections of discontinuity surfaces with the scene. In addition, we develop an algorithm which identifies visibility changes by exploiting information contained in the planar discontinuity mesh of each scene polygon, obviating the need for many expensive searches in 3 D space. A full implementation of the algorithm is presented, which allows <b>interactive</b> <b>updates</b> of high-quality soft shadows for scenes of moderate complexity.
