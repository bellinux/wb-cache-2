40|$|The {{development}} of the detrimental feature of intimal hyperplasia at the locations where bypass grafts are surgically attached to host arteries {{is believed to be}} promoted by haemodynamic factors. Thus, it is of interest to model the flow of blood through typical arterial bypass configurations in order to identify which features of the flow field encourage the progression of the disease. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of the non-Newtonian flow of blood through typical three-dimensional human femoral artery bypass graft models have been performed. The complete bypass configuration, rather than just the proximal or distal <b>junction</b> in <b>isolation,</b> has been analyzed. Steady flow studies verified the strong dependence of the anastomotic flow field on the problem geometry. Flow disturbances were minimized at low anastomotic angles. A pulsatile flow computation, using a realistic femoral artery flow pulse, demonstrated noteworthy temporal and spatial variations in the flow fields at the proximal and distal anastomoses during the cardiac cycle. Due to the oscillations in direction of the flow at the distal anastomosis, and given the persistent zones of low momentum recirculating fluid, it is concluded that fluid particle residence times in the neighbourhood of the distal anastomosis are high.

40|$|I report {{measurements}} of energy relaxation and quantum coherence times in an aluminum dc SQUID phase qubit and a niobium dc SQUID phase qubit at 80 mK. In a dc SQUID phase qubit, the energy levels of one Josephson junction {{are used as}} qubit states {{and the rest of}} the SQUID forms an inductive network to isolate the qubit junction. Noise current from the SQUID's current bias leads is filtered by the network, with the amount of filtering depending on the ratio of the loop inductance to the Josephson inductance of the <b>isolation</b> <b>junction.</b> The <b>isolation</b> unction inductance can be tuned by adjusting the current, and this allows the isolation to be varied in situ. I quantify the isolation by the isolation factor rI which is the ratio of the current noise power in the qubit junction to the total noise current power on its bias leads. I measured the energy relaxation time T 1, the spectroscopic coherence time T 2 * and the decay time constant T' of Rabi oscillations in the Al dc SQUID phase qubit AL 1 and the Nb dc SQUID phase qubit NBG, which had a gradiometer loop. In particular, I investigated the dependence of T 1 on the isolation rI. T 1 from the relaxation measurements did not reveal any dependance on the isolation factor rI. For comparison, I found T 1 by fitting to the thermally induced background escape rate and found that it depended on rI. However, further investigation suggests that this apparent dependence may be due to a small-noise induced population in j 2 i so I cannot draw any firrm conclusion. I also measured the spectroscopic coherence time T 2 *, Rabi oscillations and the decay constant T' at significantly different isolation factors. Again, I did not observe any dependence of T 2 * and T' on rI, suggesting that the main decoherence source in the qubit AL 1 was not the noise from the bias current. Similar results were found previously in our group's Nb devices. I compared T 1, T 2 * and T 0 for the qubit AL 1 with those for NBG and a niobium dc SQUID phase qubit NB 1 and found significant differences in T 2 * and T' among the devices but similar T 1 values. If flux noise was dominant, NBG which has a gradiometer loop would have the longest Rabi decay time T'. However, T' for NBG was similar to NB 1, a Nb dc SQUID phase qubit without a gradiometer. I found that T' = 28 ns for AL 1, the Al dc SQUID phase qubit, and this was more than twice as long as in NBG (T' ~ 15 ns) or NB 1 (T' ~ 15 ns). This suggests that materials played an important role in determining the coherence times of the different devices. Finally, I discuss the possibility of using a Cooper pair box to produce variable coupling between phase qubits. I calculated the effective capacitance of a Cooper pair box as a function of gate voltage. I also calculated the energy levels of a Josephson phase qubit coupled to a Cooper pair box and showed that the energy levels of the phase qubit can be tuned with the coupled Cooper pair box...|$|R

40|$|With the {{anticipation}} of increasing system demands, the need to integrate multiple functions (e. g. digital, analog, high voltage, etc.) on a single chip has become apparent. PICs (power integrated circuits), which combine high-voltage, high-current output devices with low-voltage logic and control elements, have provided better performance and reliability, and reduced cost and system size compared to the discrete approach. A major issue {{for the design of}} this kind of circuits is the substrate cross-talk between adjacent power and CMOS devices, which prevents normal operation of the circuits. The issue becomes more severe in automotive applications, in which a high temperature environment is usually involved. The commonly used isolation techniques in PICs are the traditional p-n <b>junction</b> <b>isolation</b> (JI) and the dielectric isolation (DI). But JI still requires large silicon area, and the electrical isolation is rather poor. Although the superiority of DI offered by SOI (silicon-on-insulator) technology results in a much smaller chip area and minimum leakage current, the higher wafer cost and lower heat dissipation capability limit it only to niche applications. In this paper, a novel bulk silicon isolation structure with wafer-thick, front-back trench is proposed for automotive (42 V) power integrated circuit (PIC) applications. This technique provides the advantages of complete isolation with lower wafer cost and higher thermal dissipation capability compared with the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology.

As the thickness of the SOI film reduces, it brings more merits to the VLSI devices such as easier isolation, higher packing density and reduction of kink effect. With all these advantages, thin-film SOI technology becomes very promising for PIC applications. In this thesis, a novel approach is proposed to obtain linear doping profiles for the implementation of lateral high voltage devices on thin-film SOI. The linear doping profile is obtained by using a lateral variation doping technique. In this technique, a smeared-out dopant distribution is implemented {{through the use of a}} sequence of small opening slits in the oxide mask with subsequent impurity implantation and drive-in processes. To understand the effect of the location and size of the oxide slits on the final doping profile, an one-dimensional analytical model is developed. Moreover, a computer program has also been developed to facilitate the slit parameters optimization. Validity of the model and the program has been verified by performing extensive two-dimensional process and device simulations...|$|E
40|$|With the {{anticipation}} of increasing system demands, the need to integrate multiple functions (e. g. digital, analog, high voltage, etc.) on a single chip has become apparent. Power integrated circuits (PICs) combining high-voltage, high-current output devices with low-voltage logic and control elements have improved performance and reliability, and reduced cost and system size compared to the discrete approach. A major issue {{for the design of}} this kind of circuits is the substrate cross-talk between adjacent devices that prevents normal operation through latch-up mechanism. Some basic solutions for isolation in PICs, such as the traditional p-n <b>junction</b> <b>isolation</b> (JI) and the dielectric isolation (DI), have been proposed. Among the two, JI requires large silicon area and suffers from large leakage current at severe conditions. Although the superiority of DI offered by silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology results in a much smaller chip area and minimum leakage currents, the higher wafer cost and lower heat dissipation capability limit its use only to niche applications. In this thesis, a novel isolation structure with ultra-deep trench and backside etching is proposed. It can achieve complete isolation with low wafer cost, reduced isolation area, and high heat dissipation capability. First, the design and operation of the novel isolation structure as well as the 2 -D device and thermal simulation results is discussed. Then, the layout design and fabrication process for experimental characterization of the novel isolation structure are presented. Finally, experimental techniques for characterizing the electrical and thermal performance of the devices in both the novel isolation structure and SOl are presented. The simulation and experimental results show that the novel isolation structure can provide complete isolation as that of the SOl isolation structure, but with an average of 26 % improvement on heat capability during the power device turn-off transient with short gate pulse duration. After the system is heated more, the heat capability of the novel isolation structure is not as good as that of the SOI isolation structure due to the low thermal conductivity of the air gap underneath the power device. However, this novel isolation technology offers a potential cost reduction of 5 X to 10 X compared to the SOl technology...|$|E
