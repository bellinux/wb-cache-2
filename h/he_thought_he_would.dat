5|$|During his {{operations}} in Isauria, Illus took Zeno's brother, Longinus, prisoner and {{kept him in}} an Isaurian fortress. Because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have great influence over a restored Zeno, he changed sides and marched with Zeno towards Constantinople {{in the summer of}} 476. When Basiliscus received news of this danger, he hastened to recall his ecclesiastical edicts and to conciliate the Patriarch and the people, but it was too late.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{scored the}} first penalty in sudden death. Kalou then sent Van der Sar {{the wrong way}} to make it 5–5. Giggs was next up and he was also successful. Van der Sar then pulled off the crucial save for United; he pointed to his left to {{indicate}} to Nicolas Anelka that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> kick to that side, as had the six players who had kicked before him, only to correctly dive to his right to deny Anelka, whose kick was at a good height to be saved, securing European football's top prize for United {{for the third time in}} their history.|$|E
5|$|Finn and Jake {{grab hold}} of the {{captured}} Lich as he is transported to the Citadel. Once there, they discover a human figure encased in a crystal-like substance, who they conclude must be Finn's father. Meanwhile, the Lich uses his malevolent magic to begin melting the Citadel and turning its prisoners to his will. Finn's father, Martin (voiced by Stephen Root), is eventually freed by the Lich's actions, and as the Citadel guardians battle the escaping prisoners he, Finn, and Jake try to escape. One of the Citadel guardians, however, uses its laser and melts away part of Martin's flesh on his leg. Finn retrieves some guardian blood, which repairs and heals Martin. However, Finn starts to realize that his father is not the hero that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be.|$|E

5|$|The German {{troops were}} {{reluctant}} to attack head on once again, and Sergeant Vinz Kulbach pleaded with the officers of the 9th Fallschirmjäger Regiment to allow his men to flank the Americans in the dusk. Fifty men from Fusilier Regiment 27 of the 12th Volksgrenadier Division were dispatched to attack the American's southern flank through the woods. Just as Bouck was about to blow his whistle to indicate withdrawal, German soldiers penetrated their lines and began overrunning their foxholes. Several attackers were killed by grenades rigged to wires and triggered by Americans in their foxholes. Each of the positions spread out over the ridge top were overrun in turn. Surprisingly, the Germans did not simply kill the defenders in their foxholes. Bouck was pulled from his foxhole by an officer with a machine gun, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be shot when the German put his weapon in his back and pulled the trigger; it was empty. Both Bouck and the German officer were then struck by bullets. The German fell seriously wounded, while Bouck was struck in the calf. Sergeant Kuhlbach asked Bouck who was in command, and Bouck replied that he was. Kuhlbach asked him why the Americans were still shooting, and Bouck {{said it was not}} his men doing it. Bouck surrendered and helped carry his wounded men down to the village.|$|E
25|$|During {{his later}} life, {{he was a}} vegetarian. He never married. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be rewarded in heaven for not doing so.|$|E
50|$|At {{the age of}} twenty-seven, he {{returned}} to the military life, mostly because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{be given the opportunity to}} fly. He was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps on 25 January 1909.|$|R
60|$|At first, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{take the}} beetle away from Nathan by force; but he {{reflected}} in a moment {{that this would be}} wrong, and so finally he concluded to go and state the case to his mother.|$|R
50|$|Van Dijk {{was born}} in Voorhout, South Holland. In his youth, <b>he</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> make it to become a {{professional}} footballer. He only enjoyed playing football with his friends on amateur level, while his dream {{was to become a}} physical education teacher.|$|R
25|$|Pope Paul VI died on 6 August 1978, {{ending a}} reign of fifteen years. Luciani {{had gone to}} the late pope's funeral and mingled with the crowds who wanted to view the body of the late pope. In a certain moment, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not reach the body. But finally he was {{recognised}} once he had arrived and was then led to another place and was offered a bench to kneel and pray.|$|E
25|$|Everyone {{can imagine}} how terrified the peasant must have been when he saw Thor making his brows sink down over his eyes; as for what could be seen of the eyes themselves, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{collapse}} at just the very sight. Thor clenched {{his hands on the}} shaft of the hammer so that the knuckles went white, and the peasant did as one might expect, and all his household, they cried out fervently, begged for grace, offered to atone with all their possessions.|$|E
25|$|Toshio Masuda {{was born}} in Kobe, Japan. His father was a seaman. He {{enrolled}} in a technical training school, however, his mindset did not mesh with the school's military indoctrination and he was expelled in July 1945. He next attended the Osaka University of Foreign Studies (now Osaka University) where he specialized in Russian literature. There he became enamoured with French cinema which led him away from Russian grammar and towards {{a career in the}} film industry. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have been bored as a salaryman and that filmmaking would better suit him but suggested he probably would not have followed through had his friends not sought similar careers. After graduating in 1949, he moved to Tokyo to study screenwriting at the Shintoho Studio's Scenario Academy.|$|E
50|$|In August 2008, he {{received}} international press for commenting to The Salt Lake Tribune about how Jesus would vote.

25|$|Slemmer and Gilman {{stepped aside}} and soon {{returned}} {{to say they}} would reply the next day. Slemmer asked Chase how many men he had, whether he could take the fort by storm and how many men <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> lose. Chase replied that he could take the fort but supposed he might lose half of his force. Slemmer responded {{that he did not}} believe Chase was willing to make that sacrifice. Chase said that Slemmer must know that Florida could not permit the fort to be held and that an attack would start a civil war. Slemmer said he wanted to consult with the captains of two U.S. Navy vessels in the harbor. The next day, as the Navy vessels withdrew, Slemmer refused the demand for surrender of the fort. He refused a similar demand from Chase on January 18, 1861.|$|E
25|$|Fangio, unlike later Formula One drivers, {{started his}} racing career at a mature age {{and was the}} oldest driver in many of his races. During his career, drivers raced with almost no {{protective}} equipment on circuits with no safety features, although F1 cars back in the 1950s were a lot slower, less physically demanding to drive and less advanced than F1 cars 4 and more decades later. Fangio had no compunction about leaving a team, even after a successful year or even during a season, if <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{have a better chance}} with a better car. As was then common, several of his race results were shared with teammates after he took over their car during races when his own had technical problems. His rivals included Alberto Ascari, Giuseppe Farina and Stirling Moss. Throughout his career, Fangio was backed by funding from the Argentine government of Juan Perón.|$|E
500|$|Brett Ratner, who was {{previously}} considered to direct X-Men in 1996, replaced Vaughn during pre-production. Ratner {{said he was}} surprised to get an invitation, as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have no chance to do a comic-book film after the cancelled [...] for Warner Bros. With a limited knowledge of the X-Men mythos, Ratner trusted his writers on doing something faithful to the comics, having the script drawing all of its scenes from the original Marvel publications.|$|E
50|$|Cedric {{appeared}} {{as the lead}} comedian at the White House Correspondents Dinner but jokingly remarked that he was unprepared because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> follow a humorous speech by President George W. Bush but instead followed First Lady Laura Bush, who he said was very funny.|$|R
5000|$|Brian Basco, {{the only}} player-controlled character, is a {{doctoral}} candidate in Physics at Berkeley. Brian {{broke out of}} his nerdy shell after going through so many adventures and meeting so many interesting characters in Runaway: A Road Adventure. He will stop at nothing to save the woman <b>he</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have, Gina.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{before he}} left that place, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have just one more look at the {{beautiful}} figure. So he did, and gazed and gazed until his heart melted away within him like a lump of butter; and, hardly knowing what he did, he stooped and kissed the lips.|$|R
500|$|Following a brief hiatus, Polydor Records enlisted Brian Higgins and Xenomania {{to produce}} Girls Aloud's second album in its entirety, {{following}} {{the success of}} their debut album. Higgins explained that Polydor were not going to continue with the group's contract unless he produced songs for the album. He continued, saying that his initial reaction was that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> only be required to produce a couple of songs, however Polydor insisted that he produce the album in its entirety and that they thought only he understood what they wanted. The album was recorded from April to September 2004, with the lead single being released in June 2004.|$|E
500|$|At first, Schwimmer did {{not want}} to wear the afro wig and {{mustache}} because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> look like Gabe Kaplan in Welcome Back, Kotter (a similarity referenced in the episode). He relented because it enabled him to [...] "tap into a part of himself that was very vulnerable and shy" [...] and incorporate it into his performance. An early script draft featured a scene in the prom video in which an episode of All My Children is on in the background. The scene was intended to feature the character [...] "Bryce", played by Gunther (as revealed in [...] "The One Where Eddie Won't Go").|$|E
500|$|After his {{perfunctory}} reconnaissance, Frederick {{returned to}} his camp to develop his battle plan. [...] He planned to direct a diversionary force, commanded by Finck, to the Hühner Fliess, to demonstrate in front of what he {{believed to be the}} main Russian line. He would march with his main army to the southeast of the Allied position, circling around Kunersdorf, screened by the Reppen Forest. This way, <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> surprise his enemy, forcing the Allied army to reverse fronts, which is a complicated maneuver for even the best trained troops. Frederick could then employ his much feared oblique battle order, feinting with his left flank as he did so. Ideally, this would allow him to roll up the Allied line from the Mühlberge.|$|E
60|$|Then Lisle {{yielded to}} {{a strong sense of}} satisfaction. For the next month or two <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be almost {{constantly}} in Millicent's company; her companions were his friends, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not be troubled by Gladwyne's presence. Desiring to assure himself on the latter point, he turned to Bella.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bates {{said that}} <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would.</b> As the same {{invitation}} was given {{on almost every}} Sunday throughout the year, and was invariably answered in the same way, {{there was not much}} excitement in this. But Mr. Bates would not have dreamed of going in to dinner without being asked.|$|R
6000|$|Calling another ship, I stepped aboard, {{and gave}} {{directions}} {{to be taken}} to No. 900 Tottenham Court Road, where I had an aunt; then, walking aft to the man at the wheel, asked him if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> like to hear me read [...] "Naseby Fight." [...] <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would: <b>he</b> <b>would</b> like to hear that, and then I might pass on to something else--Kinglake's [...] "Crimean War," [...] the proceedings at the trial of Warren Hastings, or some such trifle, just to wile away the time till eight bells.|$|R
500|$|The show {{revolved}} around the life Carey would have lived {{if he had not}} become a stand-up comedian. Carey told Helford that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have been employed in a mid-level management job, which was a relatable job for most Americans at the time. Carey wanted a show that was about regular people. He also wanted to set the show in Cleveland as it was his hometown and it was not getting a lot of attention. Carey and Helford drove to the city together in January 1995 to do some research. They toured the local bars {{to try to get the}} right look for the show's bar the Warsaw Tavern. Carey and Helford also heard the song [...] "Moon Over Parma" [...] in one of the bars and it was used during the title sequence.|$|E
500|$|More {{than two}} weeks before the 2008 NFL Draft, the Miami Dolphins, who owned the right to make the first {{selection}} in the draft determined that they wanted to negotiate with Long to be their pick and met with Tom Condon, Long's sports agent. [...] On April 22, 2008, in advance of the April 26 and 27 draft, Long agreed to a five-year, $57.75 million deal with the Miami Dolphins. The deal included $30 million in guaranteed money and made Long the first overall pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. This made him, as of that date, the highest paid offensive lineman in NFL history. At Dolphins minicamp on May 2, Long was assigned number 79 and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have to negotiate with Drew Mormino for the number 77 that he had worn since high school. [...] However, after he failed his physical exam, Mormino was released from the team, and before training camp Long was assigned number 77.|$|E
500|$|Following a brief hiatus, Polydor Records enlisted Brian Higgins and Xenomania {{to produce}} Girls Aloud's second album in its entirety, {{following}} {{the success of}} their debut album Sound of the Underground. Higgins explained that Polydor were not going to continue with the group's contract unless he produced songs for the album. He continued, saying that his initial reaction was that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> only be required to produce a couple of songs, however Polydor insisted that he produce the album in its entirety and that they thought only he understood what they wanted. The album was recorded from April to September 2004, although its lead single [...] "The Show" [...] was released in June 2004. Bandmate Nicola Roberts said that [...] "Love Machine" [...] was recorded in 18 parts over three days. Roberts also revealed that the band initially was in disagreement with Polydor regarding its release as a single, with Sarah Harding adding that all the girls wanted to release [...] "Deadlines & Diets" [...] instead. Kimberley Walsh and Nadine Coyle in particular voiced their disapproval of the single release, Coyle stating it would be [...] "career suicide" [...] and that she thought the group would be known as laughing stocks if the song came out.|$|E

50|$|He said on his 110th {{birthday}} that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> reach age 111 {{next year}} and (perhaps jokingly) {{that he might be}} able to reach ages 115, 120, and 130.

6000|$|...

Of course {{he said he was}} sorry, but he did not really seem to be, and <b>he</b> says <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it <b>would</b> be very much better for me. I <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was grateful, father, and liked us very much, and now I am quite {{disappointed}} in him." ...|$|R
