[...] He went on to reject the American cases dealing with freedom of religion on the basis that the Singapore Constitution did not prohibit the [...] "establishment' of any religion unlike the American Constitution which had an anti-establishment clause. Nonetheless, the Chief Justice went on to approve an Australian case, Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses v. Commonwealth of Australia (1943), with respect to limitations on the religious freedom of Jehovah's Witnesses. This may imply that Singapore courts embrace foreign cases [...] "selectively".|$|E
500|$|Steiner {{responded to}} {{criticism}} that Hitler's {{speech in the}} book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before: for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost (1667), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov (1880). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler (A.H.) is [...] "a fictive figure", and that it is not he who has the last word, but Teku, the Indian tracker, who shouts [...] "Proven". Dominick LaCapra said that Teku's declaration is ambiguous, meaning either Hitler has proved his innocence or his guilt. Steiner explained this ambiguity by adding that Teku is the Hebrew word used to indicate that [...] "there are <b>issues</b> <b>here</b> beyond our wisdom to answer or decide." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the second}} season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Anasazi" [...] was rated an A, being described as [...] "mind-blowing if frustrating", with it being noted that the episode [...] "made fans want to fast-forward through summer." [...] Writing The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode an A-, noting that the episode [...] "has {{a lot of really}} strong moments" [...] and praising Duchovny's acting. However, he felt that the episode marked {{the point at which the}} series' overarching mythology would begin to lose focus, explaining that [...] "it's troubling that instead of answering any big <b>issues</b> <b>here</b> ... the show only gives us new directions". Chris Carter said of the episode, [...] "I'm proud of the way it came together, what it did for the series, and the overwhelmingly positive response it has gotten. I'm very pleased beginning season three with where this episode put us—which is that it posed more questions than it answered." [...] He later said in 2005 that the episode brought a lot of interest to the show due to the apparent death of agent Mulder. The episode, along with both other parts of the story arc, were listed concurrently as the second-best episode of the series by Den of Geek's Nina Sordi. Sordi noted that the plotline [...] "laid the groundwork for the mythology arc for the rest of the series", adding that it [...] "brought much more significance to what is to come".|$|E

GameSpot awarded it an [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] label, praising its storyline, the combat system and its presentation, and also stating that [...] "Crisis Core is an exciting and poignant journey that every fan of role-playing games should take." [...] IGN's Ryan Clements praised its differences from other RPGs, due to its focus on Zack's growth and {{his relationship with the}} SOLDIERs. He stated [...] "Crisis Core is a great game and, barring a few minor <b>issues</b> <b>here</b> and there, will not disappoint." [...] It also received a place amongst the [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] gallery of recommended games for the PSP platform. GameSpy also gave it a good review, stating it [...] "is equal parts tribute and original, marrying classic design choices with refreshingly new techniques, harmoniously bringing together something old with something new." [...] Gamespy also commented that although some players may dislike Zack, [...] "you'll have to be pretty jaded for the character not to grow on you as you progress through the adventure." [...] VideoGamer.com gave an overall score of 9, finding its fighting system [...] "addictive", and arguing that its CGI scenes had a similar quality to the ones from Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Similarly, GamePro gave it a positive review, calling it the [...] "best looking PSP title," [...] and praising how it incorporated elements from the Compilation, {{and at the same time}} created new aspects. GamesRadar's AJ Glasser stated that with the DMW system, the gameplay could be easy, causing the [...] "rare gamer" [...] to try to play it in Hard Mode. Glasser also found the game likeable enough so that even gamers who dislike the Final Fantasy VII series may enjoy it. Plays Samuel Roberts called it the best game of 2008.|$|E
