50|$|Early {{products}} {{included the}} PenPad 200 handwriting-only computer terminal {{that was a}} direct replacement for the VT-100 and other standard ANSI 3.62 terminals, but with a digitizing tablet and <b>electronic</b> <b>pen</b> and no keyboard. With {{the advent of the}} IBM personal computer, later products, such as the PenPad 320 focused particularly graphics and CAD/CAM applications for the DOS operating system, as well as for data entry and data editing applications.|$|E
50|$|Along {{the bottom}} of the {{digitizer}} was a template with commands which could be selected as required, so the keyboard was often not required. Assembly was aided for many users by the familiar look of the large digitizer, which looked much like the drawing boards common at the time.

50|$|A {{major issue}} that {{different}} technologies {{in this area}} attempt to overcome is sensory overload. The amount of {{information that can be}} quickly related via touch is less than that of vision and is limited by current technology. As a result, multi-modal approaches, converting the visual information into both haptic and auditory output, often have the best results. For example, an <b>electronic</b> <b>pen</b> can be drawn across a tablet mapped to the screen and produce different vibrations and sounds depending on what is at that location.|$|E
40|$|Handheld {{appliances}} such as PDAs, organisers or <b>electronic</b> <b>pens</b> {{are currently}} very popular.

Rudimentary infrastructures to exchange data between handhelds exist, {{but they are not}} designed for a seamless integration into handheld applications. The fundamental different nature of handheld devices to desktop computers leads to a number of issues. In this paper, we first analyse the specific characteristics of handheld devices, the corresponding applications and how users interact with handhelds. We identify three basic requirements for a successful realisation: privacy, awareness and usability. Based on these considerations, we present our own approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{in this study}} was to evaluate the capacity of electronic nose to monitoring the effect of different Maillard reaction processes on natural flavors of sesame oil, using a specific <b>Electronic</b> Nose device (<b>PEN</b> 3). The flavors were prepared by Maillard reaction using chemical constituents from water extract of Lentinus and other precursors. The optimum conditions of reaction process was determined by using orthogonal test design, then an <b>Electronic</b> Nose (<b>PEN</b> 3) was used to characterize and classify eight different flavors from different reaction process and sesame oil from market. This method firstly sampled aroma composition emanating from the flavors by PEN 3 systems and then obtained response values of PEN 3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) were used in order to investigate whether the electronic nose was able to distinguish among different Maillard Reaction Production (MRP). The loadings analysis was used to identify the sensors responsible for discrimination in the current pattern file. The results of this study showed that the basic components added with lysine, xylose and glycerin, heated in glycerine bath at 140 C for 120 min, was a novel flavors with sesame oil flavor and taste. The <b>electronic</b> nose <b>PEN</b> 3 can discriminate successfully different MRPs using both PCA and LDA analysis. But, it was not able to detect a clear difference in the sample of similar aroma with sesame oil using PCA analysis. Some sensors have the highest influence in the current pattern file for <b>electronic</b> nose <b>PEN</b> 3. A subset of few sensors can be chosen to explain all the variance. This result could be used in further studies to optimize the number of sensors...|$|R

50|$|The first {{devices to}} {{accurately}} record handwriting {{that could be}} connected to computers were graphics tablet, or digitizer, x-y-tablet, graphics pad, with <b>electronic</b> <b>pens</b> {{as we know them}} today. Among the earliest tablets are theStyalator <b>electronic</b> tablet with <b>pen</b> for computer input and handwriting recognition in 1957 and the commercial products by Vector General. The Vector General products reported the position of the stylus at 100 Hz and claimed an accuracy of 0.1 cm. Typical tablets sense the position of the pen electromagnetically. Touch-sensitive tablets cannot be used when the hand is resting on the tablet unless they implement some form of hand rejection. Tablets can have a display built in (e.g., as in a tablet PC). Still today, handwriting tablets are the gold standard to record handwriting. Sampling rates used to be 100 Hz until it was decided that the minimum rate for Human Input Devices HID should be at least 133 Hz, bumping the sampling rates up to 133 - 200 Hz. The advantage is a 15%-40% reduction of device noise and quantization noise. The digitizer technology belongs to the most accurate and cost-effective pointing devices. Dynamic accuracy of 0.01 cm at constant frequency is achievable. Opaque tablets are produced by Wacom who also produces display digitizers, Euronovate SA, Hanvon, VisTablet, Adesso, Genius.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the evolution of}} the novel shared drawing medium ClearBoard which was designed to seamlessly integrate an interpersonal space and a shared workspace.

40|$|Hand-done {{design drawing}} {{still has a}} several {{advantages}} over current, CADbased approaches to generating form, especially {{in the early stages}} of design. One advantage is the indeterminacy of hand drawing [...] i. e. its abstractness and ambiguity. Another is a non-destructive drawing process, where new drawings are created without modifying old ones. A third is designersi creation of large collections of inter-related drawings [...] i. e. graphical hyperdocuments. A fourth is the unobtrusive character of conventional drawing tools. These advantages might be taken as reasons for continuing to do early design on paper, but they also suggest ways in which CAD might be improved. We have created software prototypes that incorporate these features into a new type of CAD based on sketching with <b>electronic</b> <b>pens</b> on LCD tablets. One prototype, which we call HyperSketch II, simulates tracing paper in the sense that it enables the user to trace over previous drawings and to build stacks of traced over drawings. It also enables the user to create a hypermedia network in which the nodes are sketches and the links represent various relationships between sketches...|$|R

Using an <b>electronic</b> <b>pen,</b> the contestants wrote down a word which rhymed with the last word in the second sentence (the home audience was shown the contestants' words, but the panelists were not). Once the words were written, contestants (alternating turns) called upon one celebrity to devise a second part of the poem, hoping the last word the celebrity used would match the contestant's; doing so earned that contestant two points. If the celebrity guessed the opponent's word, the opponent received one point. If the celebrity said neither word, his/her opponent chose another celebrity.|$|E

40|$|There are {{empirical}} {{and theoretical}} reasons for believing that current CAD does not adequately support the early, conceptual stages of design. Hand-done design drawing has a several advantages over current, CAD-based approaches to generating form in these stages.

Another is a non-destructive drawing process, where new drawings are created without modifying old ones.

The second prototype adds the HyperSketching functionality to our existing PHIDIAS HyperCAD system. This aids design by using the sketches to index and retrieve multimedia information that is useful for a variety of design tasks...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years the {{development}} of low-cost intertial sensors has been pushed forward. The dimensions of the newest sensors measure a few millimeters only. At the same time the prices of the sensors decrease being caused by enormously increasing production fifures and the application of low cost micro mechanical silicon structures. This makes applications with low cost systems possible in the meantime. The Fraunhofer TEG in Stuttgart has demonstrated the possibility of motion-tracing of an object with new low cost miniturised sensors. The main disadvantage of low cost IMUs is the sensor drift, since decreasing size and price are usually paid for with a loss of sensor accuracy. In the past this drawback has more than compensated the advantage of the low cost sensors. In order to circumvent the problem of lacking sensor accuracy innovative and complex processing algorithms are needed. Here calibration of the sensors is an important factor. The motivation in developing IMUs for the Fraunhofr TEG is both the need of IMUs in hand- held-devices for engineering applications, medical applications and for low cost systems for the mass market. Marketable products like computer mice and <b>electronic</b> <b>pens</b> are only two of many applications of IMUs in the low cost segment...|$|R
