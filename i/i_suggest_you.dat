500|$|In July 1933, Gernsback {{dismissed}} Lasser as editor. Lasser {{had become}} active in promoting workers' rights and was spending less {{time on his}} editorial duties. According to Lasser, Gernsback told him [...] "if you like working with the unemployed so much, <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>you</b> go and join them". It is likely that cost-cutting was also a consideration, as Lasser was paid $65 per week, a substantial salary in those days. Soon after Lasser was let go, Gernsback received a fanzine, The Fantasy Fan, from a reader, Charles Hornig. Gernsback called Hornig to his office to interview him for the position of editor; Hornig {{turned out to be}} only17, but Gernsback asked him to proofread a manuscript and decided that the results were satisfactory. Hornig was hired at an initial salary of $20 per week. That same year, Gernsback dissolved Stellar Publications and created Continental Publications as the new publisher for Wonder Stories. The schedule stuttered for the first time, missing the July and September 1933 issues; the recent bankruptcy of the company's distributor, Eastern Distributing Corporation, may have been partly responsible for this disruption. The first issue with Continental on the masthead, and the first listing Hornig as editor, was November 1933.|$|E
2500|$|November – Ernest L. Wilkinson, the {{president}} of BYU and Commissioner of Church Education, gave his [...] "Make Honor Your Standard" [...] address on September 23 to the BYU student body, stating, [...] "nor do we intend to admit to this campus any homosexuals. ... f any of you have this tendency, ... may <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>you</b> leave the University immediately .... We do not want others on this campus to be contaminated by your presence." [...] The speech was later published in the church-owned Deseret News.|$|E
2500|$|St. Mary's also {{competed in}} the Hampshire Senior Cup in 1892–93, hoping to claim a third {{consecutive}} victory. After 2–0 wins over the Royal Engineers and a side from Portsmouth, they reached the final against local rivals Freemantle. The final was played on 11 March 1893 at the County Ground {{in front of a}} substantial crowd who threatened to spill onto the pitch. Freemantle led 1–0 at half-time before Jack Dollin equalised. With the score 1–1 and only a few minutes left to play, a Freemantle forward, Horton, was about to score past Ralph Ruffell in the Saints' goal when he was tripped by William Stride. Despite protests from the [...] "Saints", the referee awarded a penalty to Freemantle, which was converted by Shirley Hawkins, giving Freemantle their first trophy. After the match, Carter protested to the referee that the foul had been committed outside the penalty area, saying that he could point out the exact spot where the offence occurred. The referee, Mr. Royston Bourke, replied: [...] "In that case, <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>you</b> have a tombstone erected over it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw {{gave the}} film four stars in September 2001, {{choosing}} {{it as the}} best film of the week. He praised Takeshi Kitano's performance as the teacher {{and some of the}} scenes as [...] "a stunningly proficient piece of action film-making, plunging us into a world of delirium and fear." [...] He notes that, among [...] "the hail of bullets and the queasy gouts of blood, troubling narratives of yearning and sadness are played out. It is as if the violence of Battle Royale is not a satire of society at all, but simply a metaphor for the anguish of adolescent existence." [...] He concluded that, while some [...] "will find the explicit violence of this movie repulsive", it [...] "is a film put together with remarkable confidence and flair. Its steely candour, and weird, passionate urgency make it compelling." [...] Bryant Frazer of Deep Focus [...] gave it a B+ rating and called it [...] "a vicious take-off on reality TV that turns a high-school milieu dominated by cliques and childish relationships into a war zone." [...] British critic Jonathan Ross stated that [...] "if you want to catch a wildly original and super-cool slice of entertainment before it gets remade and ruined by the Americans, then <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>you</b> try hard not to miss it" [...] and concluded that [...] "it's a wildly imaginative example of just what can be achieved in a teen movie." [...] In 2009, filmmaker Quentin Tarantino praised Battle Royale as the best film he had seen in the past two decades, stating that, [...] "If there’s any movie that’s been made since I’ve been making movies that I wish I had made, it’s that one." ...|$|E

I can remain here if you have alternative suggestion, but unaided I cannot break in. I find my infantry cannot fight more than ten miles from camp, and then only if water can be got, and it is scarce here. Whatever happens, recollect to burn your cipher, decipher, and code books, and all deciphered messages.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have to tell}} you, Captain Brown," [...] pursued Herrick, [...] "that I resign my {{position}} as mate. You can put me in irons or shoot me, as you please; I will make no resistance--only, I decline {{in any way to}} help or to obey you; and <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>you</b> should put Mr. Huish in my place. He will make a worthy first officer to your captain, sir." [...] He smiled, bowed, and turned to walk forward.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are going}} on? Madam, it's a forlorn hope. Mezquital is {{a hundred miles}} away. But there's a chance--the barest chance if your man can drive this car. The Mexicans are either murderous or ceremonious in their executions. The {{arrangements}} for Stewart's will be elaborate. But, barring unusual circumstances, it will take place precisely at the hour designated. You need no permit. Your messages are official papers. But to save time, perhaps delay, <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>you</b> take this Mexican, Senor Montes, with you. He outranks Don Carlos and knows {{the captain of the}} Mezquital detachment." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I didn't {{want to be}} the one to tell you," [...] replied Jimmy. [...] "I {{preferred}} that the C.P.A.'s discover it, as they will within the next day or two--you are being systematically robbed. I suspected it before I had been there ten days, and I was absolutely sure of it at the time <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>you</b> employ the C.P.A.'s. You are being robbed at the rate of approximately one thousand dollars a week." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am warning you, that's all. If I {{were you}} I'd never leave without a {{try to find}} the white girl, and I'd never forsake my Indian bride. I've been through the same thing. You must be a good woodsman, or Wetzel wouldn't have let you stay with him. Pick out a {{favorable}} time and make the attempt. <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>you</b> make your Indian girl show you where Girty is. She knows, but is afraid to tell you, for she fears Girty. Get your dog and horse from the Shawnee. That's a fine horse. He can carry you both to safety. Take him away from Silvertip." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If she'll go. Mind you, I don't advise {{her to do}} it!" [...] he added, {{interrupting}} his son's outcry. [...] "I think she's {{taking all}} the chances." [...] He turned to Mrs. McFarlane. [...] "I'm old-fashioned in my notions of marriage, Mrs. McFarlane. I grew up when women were helpmates, such as, I judge, you've been. Of course, it's all guesswork {{to me at the}} moment; but I have an impression that my son has fallen into an unusual run of luck. As I understand it, you're all out for a pleasure trip. Now, my private car is over in the yards, and <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>you</b> all come along with me to California--" ...|$|E
60|$|If {{they will}} not do this--if they prefer to hazard all {{for the sake of}} {{destroying}} the government--it is for them to consider whether it is probable I will surrender the government to save them from losing all. If they decline what <b>I</b> <b>suggest,</b> <b>you</b> scarcely need to ask what I will do. What would you do in my position? Would you drop the war where it is? Or would you prosecute it in future with elder-stalk squirts charged with rose water? Would you deal lighter blows rather than heavier ones? Would you give up the contest, leaving any available means unapplied? I am in no boastful mood. I shall not do more than I can, and I shall do all I can, to save the government, which is my sworn duty as well as my personal inclination. I shall do nothing in malice. What I deal with is too vast for malicious dealing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{naturally}} {{know what}} they would think of any proposition like the one you made me. Anyway, as <b>I</b> <b>suggested,</b> all <b>you</b> {{have to do is}} to try them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you must}} not let me {{influence}} you in any way. <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> that <b>you</b> go on your line and I on mine. We can compare notes afterwards, and each will supplement the other." ...|$|R

6000|$|Even without {{striking}} {{out in the}} way <b>I</b> <b>suggest,</b> <b>you</b> are already disturbing your betters considerably. I sometimes talk this over with M'Connachie, with whom, as you may guess, circumstances compel me to pass {{a good deal of}} my time. In our talks we agree that we, your betters, constantly find you forgetting that we are your betters. Your answer is that the war and other happenings have shown you that age is not necessarily another name for sapience; that our avoidance of frankness in life and in the arts is often, but not so often as you think, a cowardly way of shirking unpalatable truths, and that you have taken us off our pedestals because we look more natural on the ground. You who are at the rash age even accuse your elders, sometimes not without justification, of being more rash than yourselves. 'If Youth but only knew,' we used to teach you to sing; but now, just because Youth has been to the war, it wants to change the next line into 'If Age had only to do.' ...|$|E
