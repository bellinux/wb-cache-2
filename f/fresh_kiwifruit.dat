40|$|Attention {{is drawn}} to the {{feasibility}} of using high sensitivity isothermal heat conduction calorimetry to study metabolic responses of differently processed and stored fresh-cut fruit. The heat production of endogenous (tissue metabolism during 12 h of analysis at 10 degrees C for kiwifruit and strawberry) and exogenous (microbial growth during 18 d of analysis at 10 degrees C for cantaloupe) biological processes was investigated. Osmotic dehydration of <b>fresh</b> <b>kiwifruit</b> in sucrose solution (61. 5 g/L) at different treatment times (30, 60 and 180 min), resulted in metabolic heat production decrease, confirming the progressive cell death induced by osmotic dehydration. Analysis on strawberry slices under two atmospheric conditions (air and innovative modified atmosphere) seemed to confirm the inhibitory effect of N 2 O on metabolic activity. Cantaloupe samples immersed in three different syrups (SS: sucrose syrup (20 degrees Brix); SS 1 : SS + 0. 5 g/L ascorbic acid + 0. 5 g/L citric acid; SS 2 : SS 1 + 0. 1 g/L potassium sorbate) showed a stability increase when additives with antimicrobial properties were included. Our findings confirm that isothermal calorimetry provides a versatile and high sensitive tool for conducting fundamental metabolic studies {{on the effect of}} different processing operations on the quality and shelf life of fresh-cut fruit and vegetables.

40|$|Kiwifruit protein (actinidin) {{has been}} widely known as a protease. Kiwifruit protein has the {{potential}} of utilization in food industry as an enzyme that aids food digestion. In this project, the soluble kiwifruit proteins were extracted from fresh Hayward and SunGold kiwifruit. Soluble kiwifruit proteins were analysed by the Hartree-Lowry method, SDS-PAGE, enzyme activity determination, ion-exchange chromatography and mass spectrometry. Anti-actinidin antibodies were raised by the injection of purified actinidin into rabbits. The main soluble kiwifruit protein was recognized by anti-actinidin antibodies using Western blot. Moreover, the effects of post-harvest storage on protein content, total enzyme activity and specific enzyme activity were investigated. Comparable studies on both Hayward and SunGold kiwifruit were also carried out in this project. The results showed that Hayward and SunGold kiwifruit had a similar protein content. However, the total enzyme activity of Hayward kiwifruit was about 8 times higher than that of SunGold kiwifruit. The protein with enzyme activity (active actinidin) had a molecular weight of about 27 kDa according to SDS-PAGE and was one of main soluble proteins in Hayward and SunGold kiwifruit. This protease was purified from <b>fresh</b> <b>kiwifruit</b> by anion-exchange chromatography. A polyclonal antibody against actinidin was successfully generated in a rabbit using purified actinidin. Protein with a molecular weight of 27 kDa was recognized by the anti-actinidin antibodies. Post-harvest storage at 1 °C for up to 12 weeks significantly increased the total and specific enzyme activities of SunGold kiwifruit (P< 0. 05). By contrast, the total and specific enzyme activities of Hayward kiwifruit had a significant decrease after 16 weeks’ storage (P< 0. 05). Hayward kiwifruit had no significant changes in protein content after storage (P< 0. 05) while the protein content of SunGold kiwifruit fluctuated in a range from 5. 04 to 5. 84 mg/mL during post-harvest storage. This study may help {{to understand the nature of}} kiwifruit proteins with enzyme activity, which contributes to a full understanding of the health benefits of kiwifruit...|$|E
40|$|Tenderness, juiciness, colour and flavour are {{the most}} {{important}} meat quality attributes affecting the consumer acceptance. Maintaining the consistency of meat products by avoiding variable quality has become a major concern and great challenge to the meat industry. This in turn will also benefit meat end-users in the marketplace by having more tender meat. The present study was designed to evaluate the overall effects of pre-rigor infusion with kiwifruit juice, which contains the plant protease, actinidin, on lamb quality. A total of 18 lambs (12 months old) were divided into three treatment groups (6 lambs per each treatment). After exsanguination, lamb carcasses were infused (10 % body weight) with <b>fresh</b> <b>kiwifruit</b> juice (Ac), water (W) and compared with a noninfusion treatment which acted as a control (C). Samples from different muscle/cuts (longissimus dorsi (LD) vs leg chops) at different post-mortem times (1 day post-mortem vs. 3 wks vacuum packaged storage at 2 °C) and display time (0 to 6 days after the post-mortem storage) were analysed to monitor the changes on meat physical properties (e. g., tenderness, temperature, drip and cooking loss, colour), biochemical changes (pH, proteins and lipids) and volatile flavour compounds after the infusion treatments. The most tender meat (lowest shear force values) (P 0. 05) the volatile flavour compound profile indicating that the meat from Ac treated carcasses maintained its natural lamb flavour. No treatment differences were found for the temperature decline (P > 0. 05) between the infused treatments and C. The higher rate of pH decline (P < 0. 05) found in W carcasses might have contributed to the higher drip and cooking loss. The unbound water in meat might contribute to the higher L*-values (lightness) found in W carcasses. In summary, the proteolytic tenderizing infusion treatment using kiwifruit juice is a feasible approach for the commercial meat industry to increase profits, and also could satisfy the eating quality standards required by the consumers. In addition, tenderizing meat by using kiwifruit juice could also provide the kiwifruit processors an additional option for use of their product to gain a more profitable return...|$|E
40|$|Background: Kiwifruit {{is high in}} pectic polysaccharides {{and dietary}} fiber. This study aimed {{to find out how}} the {{ingestion}} of kiwifruit will affect intestinal microbiota populations, namely Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, and Enterococcus. Methods: Freeze dried kiwifruit (equivalent of two <b>fresh</b> <b>kiwifruits)</b> was given to each of the six subjects daily for four days. Faecal samples were collected before, during and after kiwifruit consumption. The faecal bacteria were enumerated by qPCR and RT qPCR methods. Results: The effect of the kiwifruit on intestinal microbiota profile varied between individuals; in general, the kiwifruit demonstrated a prebiotic effect of promoting the content of faecal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria (as compared to the baselines of the same individual before consumption) {{for as long as the}} fruit was consumed. The effect was however transient, the levels of the two bacteria returned near to that of the baselines upon cessation of consumption. Conclusion: Kiwifruit is a prebiotic in selectively enhancing the growth of intestinal lactic acid bacteria...|$|R
40|$|The drying {{characteristics}} {{of green and}} gold kiwifruit were determined using an air velocity of 0. 20 m/s at ambient humidity and different temperatures (60, 80 and 100 °C). The colour values (L*, a* and b*) and ascorbic acid content were also measured for the different <b>fresh</b> and dried <b>kiwifruits.</b> The drying of green and gold kiwifruit slices consists of a constant rate period (CRP) and two parts of falling rate period (FRP). The CRP drying rate, first and second FRP drying coefficients increase with drying temperature for both the green and gold kiwifruit slices. The first critical moisture content (CMC) and the dynamic equilibrium MC decrease with drying temperature for both the green and gold kiwifruit slices. The second CMC for both green and gold kiwifruit slices were not affected by drying temperature. The values for chroma of the dried green kiwifruit increased while the dried gold kiwifruit decreased with higher temperature {{as compared with the}} fresh samples. The values for hue angle of dried green and gold kiwifruits decreased at higher temperature. Lastly, the values for browning index of dried green and gold kiwifruits increased at higher temperature. There was not much change on the ascorbic acid contents of fresh and dried green and gold kiwifruits when drying at 60 and 80 °C. But there was about 19 % decrease in the ascorbic acid content of dried green and gold kiwifruits after drying at 100 °C...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the effect of {{mucilage}} edible coating extracted from Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) on the quality and shelf life maintenance of packaged kiwifruit slices. OFI mucilage alone or added with TWEEN 20 were applied on <b>kiwifruit</b> <b>fresh</b> cut surfaces. After treatments, kiwifruit samples were stored under passive atmosphere at 5 °C for 3, 5, 7 and 12 days. At each storage period, visual quality and flavor score, pectin content, ascorbic acid and the microbiological characteristics were measured together with CO 2 and O 2 content in the packages. Kiwifruit slices coated only with mucilage or with mucilage plus Tween 20, showed a significant higher firmness and a lower weight loss than untreated slices, until 5 d of shelf life. No further differences in weight loss occurred after 7 d of shelf life, while slices treated only with mucilage retained the highest firmness {{until the end of}} the shelf life period (12 d). OFI mucilage alone had significant beneficial effects on the visual and flavor score of the kiwifruit slices, throughout the shelf life period. The treatment with Tween 20 did not affect the flavor of the kiwifruit slices, compared with untreated fruit. Although mucilage and partly tween 20 addition increased microbial growth, especially of yeasts, their levels were still below the threshold for yeast spoilage at the end of the monitoring period. Hence, the results showed that mucilage coating applied to kiwifruit minimally processed fruit improved the quality of stored fresh-cut kiwifruit...|$|R
40|$|Lifestyle {{diseases}} such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, cancer, type 2 diabetes are the major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The prevalence of these diseases is high in New Zealand as well. It is believed that promoting a healthy diet and increased physical activity can make beneficial changes and extend the healthy life expectancy. This twelve week study with follow-up at 52 weeks was designed to demonstrate if a diet and physical activity group intervention in the workplace would result in changes in risk factors for antioxidant damage and therefore reduce the risk for lifestyle diseases. The effect of the addition of kiwifruit to the diet on markers of oxidative stress was also measured in a crossover sub study within this study. Fifty two healthy subjects (male 24, female 28, mean age 46), completed the 12 week study with measurements points being at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks. Thirty eight subjects presented for another set of measurements at 52 weeks. The intervention started at week 3 and the kiwifruit crossover treatment was launched between weeks 6 and 12. Ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assay was utilized to measure the changes in plasma antioxidant activity(AOA) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay to measure the changes in plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), as a marker of lipid peroxidation (LP) at each measurement point. Since almost all participants had a normal range of baseline measurements of plasma AOA and LP (plasma MDA), they were categorized as relatively low and high AOA (1200 micromol/L cut off point) and LP groups (1. 70 mmol/L cut off point), as well as divided into male and female groups. The effect of changed diet and increased physical activity during the 12 week study period resulted in a significant increase (P< 0. 05) in plasma AOA. The changes were much higher in low AOA group (P= 0. 005) and in male subjects (P< 0. 005), while no changes were observed in subjects with already high AOA at baseline. The increased plasma AOA level was maintained and increased even more over the year. No changes were observed in LP (plasma MDA). The effect of kiwifruit on the markers of oxidative stress was modest, the 3 -week daily kiwifruit consumption (2 - 3 kiwifruit per day) resulted in significant increase (P= 0. 01) in plasma AOA only in female subjects within the low AOA group. However, the precision {{and validity of the}} measurements were limited by a possible loss of vitamin C due to storage of the plasma samples rather than analysis when <b>fresh.</b> Given that <b>kiwifruit</b> is particularly high in vitamin C the effect of the addition of kiwifruit to the diet might not have been detected. In this study it was shown that a group diet and physical activity intervention within the workplace can increase the level of plasma antioxidant activity and thereby reduce the risk for oxidative stress and related lifestyle diseases...|$|R
