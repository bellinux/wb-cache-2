5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the youngest galactic supernova, G1.9+0.3, occurred in the late 19th century, considerably more recently than Cassiopeia A from around 1680. Neither supernova was noted at the time. In the case of G1.9+0.3, high extinction along the plane of the galaxy could have <b>dimmed</b> the event sufficiently to go unnoticed. The situation for Cassiopeia A is less clear. Infrared light echos have been detected showing that it was a type IIb supernova and was not in a region of especially high extinction.|$|E
5|$|Data {{processing}} led to {{the acquisition}} of 24,943 data points that suggested that some body transited, or crossed in front of (and briefly <b>dimmed),</b> WASP-15 every 3.7520 days. Approximately eleven transits, full and partial, were observed. Use of the EulerCAM photometer at the La Silla Observatory's 1.2 m Leonhard Euler Telescope on March 29, 2008 provided further evidence for an exoplanet by better defining the transit's curve. Later, the CORALIE spectrograph (also on the Euler telescope) between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 used Doppler spectroscopy to collect 21 radial velocity measurements. Analysis confirmed {{the presence of a}} planet that was later designated WASP-15b.|$|E

5|$|In 1848, Kentucky Democrats {{nominated}} Linn Boyd for governor, but Boyd {{declined the}} nomination.

5|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 19th century, Ohio was deemed a crucial battleground state; taking its electoral votes was thought {{essential}} for a Republican to win the White House. One way of, hopefully, assuring victory there was to nominate a son of Ohio. Between 1865 and 1929, every Republican president who first gained his office by election (that is, rather than succeeding on the death of his predecessor) was born in Ohio. Deadlocked Republican conventions in 1876, 1880, and 1888 turned to men born in Ohio, and in each case the nominee won the presidency. Thus, any successful Ohio Republican was a plausible president. One of McKinley's rivals among the Ohio contenders was Governor Joseph B. Foraker, but Foraker's light <b>dimmed</b> when he was defeated for a third two-year term in 1889.|$|E

5|$|Shepard died {{unexpectedly}} {{during the}} afternoon of March 24, 1893 at his Manhattan residence. Two doctors were attempting to remove a bladder stone from him. They instructed him to eat lightly, only well before the operation. They gave him the anesthetic ether at 12:45p.m. For a few minutes Shepard {{did not seem to}} react, though soon afterward his color started changing and his respiration and pulse <b>dimmed,</b> so administration of ether was stopped, however not enough ether was given to continue with the operation. His condition started to worsen again; the doctors suspected food or vomit was blocking his windpipe or bronchial tubes. The doctors then administered oxygen, which helped temporarily; however, at 4:00p.m. his pulse became steadily more feeble, he fell unconscious, and died at 4:10p.m. His cause of death was edema and congestion of the lungs, after the administration of ether, but due to an unknown cause.|$|E

5|$|The first {{mention of}} rings around Neptune {{dates back to}} 1846 when William Lassell, the {{discoverer}} of Neptune's largest moon, Triton, thought {{he had seen a}} ring around the planet. However, his claim was never confirmed and it is likely that it was an observational artifact. The first reliable detection of a ring was made in 1968 by stellar occultation, although that result would go unnoticed until 1977 when the rings of Uranus were discovered. Soon after the Uranus discovery, a team from Villanova University led by Harold J. Reitsema began searching for rings around Neptune. On 24 May 1981, they detected a dip in a star's brightness during one occultation; however, {{the manner in which the}} star <b>dimmed</b> did not suggest a ring. Later, after the Voyager fly-by, it was found that the occultation was due to the small Neptunian moon Larissa, a highly unusual event.|$|E
40|$|We report {{observations}} of a two-stage coronal <b>dimming</b> in an eruptive {{event of a}} two-ribbon flare and a fast coronal mass ejection (CME). Weak gradual <b>dimming</b> persists {{for more than half}} an hour before the onset of the two-ribbon flare and the fast rise of the CME. It is followed by abrupt rapid <b>dimming.</b> The two-stage <b>dimming</b> occurs in a pair of conjugate <b>dimming</b> regions adjacent to the two flare ribbons, and the flare onset marks the transition between the two stages of <b>dimming.</b> At the onset of the two-ribbon flare, transient brightenings are also observed inside the <b>dimming</b> regions, before rapid <b>dimming</b> occurs at the same places. These observations suggest that the CME structure, most probably anchored at the twin <b>dimming</b> regions, undergoes a slow rise before the flare onset, and its kinematic evolution has significantly changed at the onset of flare reconnection.

5|$|The {{software}} also {{calculated the}} fireball's instantaneous apparent magnitude at the ground. The computation started {{and ended with}} heights of approximately 250km, long {{before and after the}} cameras of the European Fireball Network could observe it. Its apparent magnitude started at a value of +5.7 and it became brighter quite quickly. The program gave an apparent magnitude of −5.7 when it was seen by one camera and −6.3 at perigee. The fireball subsequently <b>dimmed,</b> with an apparent magnitude of −5.4 when it was last seen by the cameras and a final calculated value of +6.0 at a height of 257km. These values are not entirely certain, because the program worked with the simplified assumption that the luminous efficacy of the fireball did not change along the track. The starting apparent magnitude is not far from the naked eye visibility limits. For example, faint stars of the magnitude +6 can be observed only in dark rural areas approximately 150km away from large cities. This magnitude corresponds to the apparent magnitude of Uranus. At its brightest, it was several times as bright as the maximum brightness of Venus.|$|E
5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is <b>dimmed</b> by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 3.68, Alpha Pyxidis is {{the brightest star}} in the constellation. Located 880 ± 30 light-years distant from Earth, it is a blue-white giant star of spectral type B1.5III that is around 22,000 times as luminous as the Sun and has 9.4 ± 0.7 times its diameter. It began life with a mass 12.1 ± 0.6 times that of the Sun, almost 15 million years ago. Its light is <b>dimmed</b> by 30% due to interstellar dust, so would have a brighter magnitude of 3.31 if not for this. The second brightest star at magnitude 3.97 is Beta Pyxidis, a yellow bright giant or supergiant of spectral type G7Ib-II that is around 435 times as luminous as the Sun, lying 420 ± 10 light-years distant away from Earth. It has a companion star of magnitude 12.5 separated by 9 arcseconds. Gamma Pyxidis is a star of magnitude 4.02 that lies 207 ± 2 light-years distant.

40|$|Deep Hα {{images of}} a sample of nearby late-type spiral galaxies have been {{analyzed}} to characterize the morphology and energetic significance of the "Diffuse Ionized Medium" (<b>DIM).</b> We find that the <b>DIM</b> properties can be reasonably unified {{as a function of}} relative surface brightness, by using a new method to quantify the <b>DIM</b> importance in galaxies. This new approach is more consistent with the fundamentally morphological definition of the <b>DIM</b> as being `Diffuse', compared to the traditional way adopted in previous studies that could only isolate the <b>DIM</b> based on an absolute surface brightness criterion. Our results suggest that the variation of the <b>DIM's</b> significance among the galaxies is small enough so that the fractional contribution of the <b>DIM</b> to the global Hα luminosity in the galaxies is fairly constant, as has been observed.
