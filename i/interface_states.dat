40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the photoluminescence (PL) from Si nanocrystals (NCs) embedded in a silicon-rich SiO 2 matrix is reported.

Whereas in standard C-V profiles the charge response is assumed to be linear (dQ = CdV), in DLCP profiles the charge response is expected to have significant non-linear behavior (dQ = C0dV + C1(dV)2 + C2(dV)3) due to the significant larger AC-signal amplitude used in the DLCP technique. DLCP can yield, like admittance spectroscopy, both the spatial and the energetic distribution of defects. The energetic distribution is obtained by varying the frequency of the AC signal, whereas the spatial distribution is sustained by modifications in the applied DC-bias.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the simple}} {{fabrication}} process, low production cost, and high efficiency, there is significant interest in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Thus, improving DSSC efficiency {{has been the subject}} of a variety of research investigations because it has the potential to be manufactured economically enough to compete with other solar cell technologies. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles have been widely used as a working electrode for DSSCs because they provide a high efficiency, more than any other metal oxide semiconductor investigated. Yet the highest conversion efficiency under air mass (AM) 1.5 (100 mW/cm2) irradiation reported for this device to date is about 11%. Despite this initial success, the effort to further enhance efficiency has not produced any major results. The transport of electrons across the particle network has been a key problem in achieving higher photoconversion efficiency in nanostructured electrodes. Because electrons encounter many grain boundaries during the transit and experience a random path, the probability of their recombination with oxidized sensitizer is increased. Therefore, it is not adequate to enlarge the oxide electrode surface area to increase efficiency because photo-generated charge recombination should be prevented. Promoting electron transfer through film electrodes and blocking <b>interface</b> <b>states</b> lying below the edge of the conduction band are some of the non-CNT based strategies to enhance efficiency that have been employed.|$|E
