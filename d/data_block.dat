2500|$|Since TFTP {{utilizes}} UDP, it has {{to supply}} its own transport and session support. Each file transferred via TFTP constitutes an independent exchange. Classically, this transfer is performed in lock-step, with only one packet (either a block of data, or an 'acknowledgement') alternatively in flight on the network at any time. Due to this single <b>data</b> <b>block</b> strategy instead of sending a fluid amount of data blocks before to pause the transfer waiting for an acknowledge (windowing), TFTP provides low throughput especially over high latency links. Microsoft introduced windowed TFTP in Windows 2008 {{as part of their}} Windows Deployment Services (WDS), in January 2015 TFTP Windowsize Option RFC 7440 was published.

2500|$|An MP3 file {{is made up}} of MP3 frames, which {{consist of}} a header and a <b>data</b> <b>block.</b> This {{sequence}} of frames is called an elementary stream. Due to the [...] "byte reservoir", frames are not independent items and cannot usually be extracted on arbitrary frame boundaries. The MP3 Data blocks contain the (compressed) audio information in terms of frequencies and amplitudes. The diagram shows that the MP3 Header consists of a sync word, which is used to identify the beginning of a valid frame. This is followed by a bit indicating that this is the MPEG standard and two bits that indicate that layer 3 is used; hence MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 or MP3. After this, the values will differ, depending on the MP3 file. ISO/IEC 11172-3 defines the range of values for each section of the header along with the specification of the header. Most MP3 files today contain ID3 metadata, which precedes or follows the MP3 frames, as noted in the diagram. The data stream can contain an optional checksum.|$|E
2500|$|The Greek {{wiretapping}} case of 2004-05, {{also referred}} to as Greek Watergate, involved the illegal telephone tapping of more than 100mobile phones on the Vodafone Greece network belonging mostly to members of the Greek government and top-ranking civil servants. The taps began sometime near the beginning of August 2004 and were removed in March 2005 without discovering the identity of the perpetrators. The intruders installed a rootkit targeting Ericsson's AXE telephone exchange. According to IEEE Spectrum, this was [...] "the first time a rootkit has been observed on a special-purpose system, in this case an Ericsson telephone switch." [...] The rootkit was designed to patch the memory of the exchange while it was running, enable wiretapping while disabling audit logs, patch the commands that list active processes and active data blocks, and modify the <b>data</b> <b>block</b> checksum verification command. A [...] "backdoor" [...] allowed an operator with sysadmin status to deactivate the exchange's transaction log, alarms and access commands related to the surveillance capability. The rootkit was discovered after the intruders installed a faulty update, which caused SMS texts to be undelivered, leading to an automated failure report being generated. Ericsson engineers were called in to investigate the fault and discovered the hidden data blocks containing the list of phone numbers being monitored, along with the rootkit and illicit monitoring software.|$|E

40|$|This work aims at {{reducing}} the main-memory footprint in high performance hybrid OLTP&OLAP databases, while retaining high query performance and transactional throughput. For this purpose, an innovative compressed columnar storage format for cold <b>data,</b> called <b>Data</b> <b>Blocks</b> is introduced. <b>Data</b> <b>Blocks</b> further incorporate a new light-weight index structure called Positional SMA that narrows scan ranges within <b>Data</b> <b>Blocks</b> {{even if the}} entire block cannot be ruled out. To achieve highest OLTP performance, the compression schemes of <b>Data</b> <b>Blocks</b> are very light-weight, such that OLTP transactions can still quickly access individual tuples. This sets our storage scheme apart from those used in specialized analytical databases where data must usually be bit-unpacked. Up to now, high-performance analytical systems use either vectorized query execution or "just-in-time" (JIT) query compilation. The fine-grained adaptivity of <b>Data</b> <b>Blocks</b> necessitates {{the integration of the}} best features of each approach by an interpreted vectorized scan subsystem feeding into JIT-compiled query pipelines.

40|$|Abstract—Distributed file systems, which manage {{large amounts}} of data over {{multiple}} commercially available ma-chines, have attracted attention as a management and pro-cessing system for big data applications. A distributed file system consists of multiple data nodes and provides reliability and availability by holding multiple replicas of data. Due to system failure or maintenance, a data node may {{be removed from the}} system and the <b>data</b> <b>blocks</b> the removed <b>data</b> node held are lost. If <b>data</b> <b>blocks</b> are missing, the access load of the other data nodes that hold the lost <b>data</b> <b>blocks</b> increases, and as a result the performance of data processing over the distributed file system decreases.
