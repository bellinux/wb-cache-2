50|$|Chaum {{published}} {{the idea of}} anonymous electronic money in a 1983 paper; eCash software on the user's local computer stored money in a digital format, cryptographically signed by a bank. The user could spend the digital money at any shop accepting eCash, without having {{to open an account}} with the vendor first, or transmitting credit card numbers. Security was ensured by public key digital signature schemes. The RSA blind signatures achieved unlinkability between withdrawal and spend transactions. Depending on the payment transactions, one distinguishes between on-line and off-line electronic cash: If the payee has to contact a third party (e.g., the bank or the credit-card company acting as an acquirer) before accepting a payment, the system is called an on-line system. In 1990, Chaum together with Moni Naor proposed the first off-line <b>e-cash</b> system, which was also based on blind signatures.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In an {{electronic}} cash (<b>e-cash)</b> system, Recoverability means {{once you have}} lost your <b>e-cash,</b> you still can get back the amount of <b>e-cash</b> that you have lost. Untraceability means no one can trace where {{and when you have}} spent your <b>e-cash.</b> Obviously these are conflicting properties in an <b>e-cash</b> system. Most of the <b>e-cash</b> systems proposed in the literature do not include recoverability. Although some of them such as [17] contain recoverability, it is an on-line <b>e-cash</b> system. In this paper, we propose a new efficient <b>e-cash</b> protocol which possesses these two properties simultaneously. At the same time, it still remains off-line.

Another benefit is instead of requesting the banks to transfer the funds through the mechanism of cheque, the <b>E-cash</b> system’s user simply transfers {{the money from the}} bank account to the account of the receiver. <b>E-cash</b> is similar to personal cheque, but is feasible for even very small transaction. As <b>E-Cash</b> system is very much in use so its security is the primary concern. The paper discusses the security concern for the <b>E-Cash</b> system.

40|$|In this research, I {{surveyed}} merchant {{and customer}} preferences for cash, near cash, and electronic cash (<b>e-cash).</b> <b>E-cash</b> promises new but untested advantages in security, portability, and privacy. In this research, I conducted a large survey of <b>e-cash</b> acceptance by customers and retail merchants to provide 3 preference orderings for cash, near cash, and <b>e-cash.</b> Nonparametric hypothesis testing showed that <b>e-cash</b> was preferred to other payment methods, but the statistics were equivocal. Stochastic dominance statistics explained the equivocal results returned from nonparametric tests. <b>E-cash</b> dominated the hybrid card but was clearly dominated by traditional cash. <b>E-cash</b> neither dominated nor {{was dominated by}} credit cards and debit cards. After adjusting for technology adoption risk, a clear preference ordering was obtained: (a) cash and credit cards were preferred to <b>e-cash,</b> and (b) <b>e-cash</b> was preferred to debit cards and hybrids. I conclude that <b>e-cash</b> is unlikely to compete well against cash and credit cards for 3 reasons: (a) switching costs, (b) technology risk, and (c) insufficient market differentiation. The results suggest that {{there may not be}} a market niche for 6 -cash. Instead, successful products are likely to emerge in the form of vertical market cash substitutes that meet specific objectives. As commerce evolves toward customization to a focused cross-section of consumers, a "one-size-fits-all" <b>e-cash</b> is not likely to remain a viable product...|$|E

There are two types of <b>e-cash</b> systems: Offine <b>e-cash</b> systems and online <b>e-cash</b> systems. Offine <b>e-cash</b> systems make it possible for the customer to pay the e-coin to the merchant without any involvement of bank. In online schemes, we require the involvement of the bank. The two most fundamental security features associated with offine scheme is the anonymity and the double spending detection. The proposed scheme maintains both the above features along with unforgeability. Besides, the E-coins have their expiration date so that the bank faces no hassles and can manage its database efficiently. This feature also ensures portability as the coins can be transferred to storage devices through the networks...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Transferable {{conditional}} electronic-cash (<b>e-cash)</b> {{allows a}} payer {{to spend an}} <b>e-cash</b> based on the outcome not known in advance. It also allows a payee to spend the <b>e-cash</b> to others, or deposit the <b>e-cash</b> to a bank based on the future outcome. Among security properties, the anonymity of the payer has been widely studied. However, the payer is linkable in the existing conditional <b>e-cash</b> schemes. This paper presents the first optimally anonymous and transferable conditional electronic-cash (<b>e-cash)</b> system based on two recent cryptographic primitives, i. e., the Groth-Sahai(GS) proof system and the commuting signatures, to obtain the user’s unlinkability and optimal anonymity. A publisher is introduced to publish the conditions, and is firstly formalized. By dividing the deposit protocol into two parts, the anonymity of the user is obtained in the deposit protocol. Compared with the existing conditional <b>e-cash</b> schemes, this scheme has the constant size for the computation and communication. Finally, we give the security proof in the standard model...|$|E
40|$|An {{electronic}} cash (<b>e-cash)</b> scheme lets a user withdraw {{money from a}} bank and then spend it anonymously. <b>E-cash</b> can be used only {{if it can be}} securely and fairly exchanged for electronic goods or services. In this paper, we introduce and realize endorsed <b>e-cash.</b> An endorsed e-coin consists of a lightweight endorsement x {{and the rest of the}} coin which is meaningless without x. We reduce the problem of exchanging <b>e-cash</b> to that of exchanging endorsements. We demonstrate the usefulness of endorsed <b>e-cash</b> by exhibiting simple and efficient solutions to two important problems: (1) optimistic and unlinkable fair exchange of <b>e-cash</b> for digital goods and services; and (2) onion routing with incentives and accountability for the routers. Finally, we show how to represent a set of n endorsements using just one endorsement; this means that the complexity of the fair exchange protocol for n coins is the same as for one coin, making <b>e-cash</b> all the more scalable and suitable for applications. Our fair exchange of multiple e-coins protocol can be applied to fair exchanges of (almost) any secrets. Keywords <b>E-cash,</b> digital signatures, fair exchange, threshold cryptography...|$|E

Furthermore, the proposed scheme satisfies the attachability property, and the attached date will not be modified by anyone else in any malicious way. Besides, in order to achieve flexibility, the proposed scheme is independent of the underlying partially blind signature technique, and hence it can be implemented easily by using any existing partially blind signature scheme as long as it is secure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Divisible <b>e-cash</b> systems allow a user to {{withdraw}} a wallet containingK coins and to spend k ≤ K coins {{in a single}} operation, respectively.

Moreover, using some techniques of the work of Canard, Pointcheval, Sanders and Traoré we are also able to prove the security in the standard model.

The decentralized nature of peer-to-peer systems makes accounting difficult. We show that <b>e-cash</b> can be a practical solution to the desire for accountability in peerto-peer systems while maintaining their ability to self-scale.
