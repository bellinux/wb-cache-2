[...] However, Rosenbaum had [...] "surprisingly little trouble following the plot and action" [...] of the film: [...] "This made-in-Madras costume drama makes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> action-packed 186 minutes." [...] In June 2009, K. S. Sivakumaran of Daily News Sri Lanka called Chandralekha [...] "the first colossal [...] film I saw." [...] Malaysian author D.

[...] Nick Levine from Digital Spy wrote that, [...] "The Hindi original, which soundtracks the Bollywood dance routine {{at the end of the}} movie, is far more urgent and atmospheric, but this remake works nicely enough as a slick, shamelessly opportunistic PCD single.

500|$|IGN's Matt Risley {{rated the}} episode an 8 out of 10, calling it more [...] "classically, indulgently, infectiously Christmassy" [...] than the {{previous}} Christmas specials. He praised the production design and special effects teams for [...] "creating some dazzlingly memorable special effects, and a winter wonderland that was both recognisably, fuzzily Christmas incarnate and unerringly, tensely alien" [...] but thought the supporting cast [...] "triumphed above and beyond" [...] the plot devices. Like Hogan, Risley commented that the comedian cast of Bailey and Weir as well as Armstrong [...] "felt lacking". However, the next year, Risley wrote that he [...] "got a little carried away with the festive funtimes ... On reflection, the overwhelming Christmassyness of it all was overcompensating <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> flimsy, frivolous plot." [...] Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the special {{four out of five}} stars, praising Smith's acting and Blackburn's Doctor Who directing debut as well as the special effects. However, he thought that the lack of a villain was an [...] "interesting experiment, but maybe not ideal for Christmas Day" [...] and Bailey and Weir's forest rangers [...] "felt like bolt-on comic relief".|$|E

[...] The actress also defends Charlie's actions claiming she did not intentionally set out to hurt May. Charlie and Angeo's relationship dynamic becomes strained after Charlie refuses to give Angelo an [...] "easy life."

2500|$|In 1980, Marriott {{contacted}} Jerry Shirley, who {{was living}} in New York City, to discuss a Humble Pie reunion. Shirley agreed and they recorded [...] "Fool <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Pretty</b> Face", which Marriott had written earlier. The new line-up included Anthony [...] "Sooty" [...] Jones, who was well respected among American east coast musicians, also vocalist and guitarist Bobby Tench, {{former member of the}} Jeff Beck Group. The song proved good enough for them to secure a recording contract with Atco. In the UK their material was released by Jet Records, owned by ex-Small Faces manager Don Arden. They recorded the heavy rock album On to Victory (1980), followed by Go for the Throat (1981), and both proved reasonably successful. They also toured America as part of the Rock 'N' Roll Marathon bill. In the latter half of 1981, Marriott was beset with personal problems.

2500|$|Upon {{hearing that}} {{tracking}} data on June 22, 2010, showed {{the film was}} not likely to produce revenue over $30 million in its first five days on screen, a FOX executive told TheWrap he was [...] "confounded", and commented, [...] "Tracking says one thing, but our sneak previews this weekend said something totally different. ... {{but if you look}} at the empirical data, we’re nowhere." [...] New York Magazine reported that the day prior to the film's release, a long scene from Knight and Day was made available on iTunes, in an attempt to improve the lackluster 28–31% [...] "definite interest" [...] level of the movie. After results were reported from the film's initial debut, FOX distribution executive Bruce Synder commented to The Hollywood Reporter, [...] "It's an adult movie opening on a Wednesday, but we opened it there and snuck it on Saturday because we believe the word-of-mouth will be good, so we're set <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good opening weekend.

2500|$|Renowned {{throughout}} his career for his capacity to provide very specific technical details about the performance of his cars and track conditions long {{before the advent of}} telemetry, this characteristic [...] led Senna's first F1 race engineer, Pat Symonds, to regard the US Grand Prix in Dallas as the initial highlight of Senna's debut season, instead of the more popular Monaco, where Senna and Toleman scored their first podium finish. This is by reference to the following recollection given by Symonds in an interview in 2014, to mark the 20th anniversary of Senna's death:The car was reasonably competitive there, so we expected to have a good race but Ayrton spun early in the race. He then found his way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good finish but then he hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real significance of that was that when he came back to the pits he told me what happened and said [...] "I'm sure that the wall moved!" [...] and even though I've heard every excuse every driver has ever made, I certainly hadn't heard of that one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with his incredible belief in himself, the absolute conviction, he then talked me into going with him, after the race, {{to have a look at}} the place where he had crashed. And he was absolutely right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened – we could see it from the tyre marks – was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and that made it swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the block was standing out by a few millimetres. And he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. While I had been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the race through a driver error, when I saw what had happened, when I saw how he had been driving, that increased my respect for the guy by quite a lot.|$|E
