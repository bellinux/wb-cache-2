5|$|Although the bunkers {{were never}} {{used in a}} real {{conflict}} during Hoxha's rule, some found use in conflicts that {{broke out in the}} 1990s. During the 1997 rebellion <b>in</b> <b>Albania,</b> the townspeople of Sarandë in southern Albania were reported to have taken up positions in bunkers around the town in the face of fighting between government troops and rebels. After the outbreak of the Kosovo War in 1999, border villages <b>in</b> <b>Albania</b> were repeatedly shelled by Serbian artillery batteries located in nearby Kosovo and local people used the bunkers to shelter from the shelling.|$|E

5|$|When Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allies in September 1943, all concentration camps <b>in</b> <b>Albania</b> were dissolved. Shortly after, the Germans invaded and occupied Albania, and most Italian soldiers in the country {{surrendered to}} the Germans. German forces then began to target for extermination all Jews living <b>in</b> <b>Albania</b> and the Albanian-dominated regions of occupied Yugoslavia. The Jewish community in western Macedonia, which had remained untouched under Italian occupation, was targeted and several groups of Jews were dispatched to extermination camps. Their property and belongings were later taken by many organizations, institutions and private individuals.|$|E

Vilain demands the item in exchange for Billy's life. The team gives up the item, but Vilain roundhouse kicks a knife through Billy's heart and flees with the Sangs by helicopter. Ross recovers a note for Sophia from Billy's body; the team buries their fallen comrade, swearing vengeance on Vilain.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the above named sub-regions, there are also two smaller regions, <b>in</b> <b>Albania</b> and Serbia respectively.

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that there were 1,800 Jews <b>in</b> <b>Albania</b> {{at the end of}} the Second World War, eleven times the number of Jews that were living in the country in 1939. The Jewish community in Kosovo never fully recovered from the war. Few Jews remained in Kosovo and many emigrated to Israel during the communist period. Similarly, most Jews <b>in</b> <b>Albania</b> decided to emigrate following the communist takeover. About 300 remained in the country until the early 1990s. The official Albanian census of April 1989 recorded 73 Jews living in the country. With the fall of Communism, Albania eased restrictions on religion and foreign travel, which resulted in virtually the entire Jewish community of the country emigrating to Israel. From December 1990 to June 1991, 350 Albanian Jews were airlifted from Albania to Israel in what was codenamed Operation Flying Carpet. Most of Albania's 60 remaining Jews left in 1997, after the country became engulfed in a brief civil war.|$|E

5|$|Kosovo Albanians were {{generally}} less hospitable to Jews {{than their counterparts}} <b>in</b> <b>Albania.</b> Due to their historical experiences with Serbs and the Ottoman Empire, they {{tended to be more}} unfriendly towards local non-Albanians. Many enthusiastically supported the Germans as a result. Claims have been made that Kosovo Albanians protected Jews after German forces took over territories that Italian authorities had controlled during the war, but the protection that Jews received in Kosovo {{in the early years of}} the war was due more to the Italian authorities than to the local Albanian population. It is estimated that 210 Jews from Kosovo perished during the war. An official Yugoslav state report published in 1964 recorded 74 Jewish wartime fatalities in the region. Approximately 600 Jews were killed <b>in</b> <b>Albania,</b> Kosovo and other Albanian-controlled territories during the war. A somewhat greater number, as well as several hundred refugees, hid and survived with the assistance of the local Albanian population.|$|E

5|$|Many rituals {{were used}} to {{identify}} a vampire. One method of finding a vampire's grave involved leading a virgin boy through a graveyard or church grounds on a virgin stallion—the horse would supposedly balk at the grave in question.

5|$|The Battle of Dyrrhachium (near present-day Durrës <b>in</b> <b>Albania)</b> {{took place}} on October 18, 1081 between the Byzantine Empire, led by the Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118), and the Normans of {{southern}} Italy under Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia and Calabria.

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the situation <b>in</b> <b>Albania</b> became unstable, and political chaos emerged as the country was split {{into a number of}} regional governments. As a consequence of the anarchy in central and northern Albania, sporadic armed conflicts continued to occur in spite of the Protocol of Corfu's ratification, and on September 3 Prince Wilhelm departed the country. In the following days, an Epirote unit launched an attack on the Albanian garrison in Berat without approval from the provisional government, managing to capture its citadel for several days, while Albanian troops loyal to Essad Pasha initiated small-scale armed operations.|$|E

5|$|During {{the six-month}} fight against Italy, the Hellenic army made {{territorial}} gains by eliminating Italian salients. Greece {{did not have}} a substantial armaments industry and its equipment and ammunition supplies increasingly relied on stocks captured by British forces from defeated Italian armies in North Africa. To man the Albanian battlefront, the Greek command was forced to withdraw forces from Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace, because Greek forces could not protect Greece's entire border. The Greek command decided to support its success <b>in</b> <b>Albania,</b> regardless of the risk of a German attack from the Bulgarian border.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though it}} has been adopted {{recently}} in Albanian folklore (around the 18th century), the clarinet, or gërneta as it is called, {{is one of the}} most important instruments <b>in</b> <b>Albania,</b> especially in the central and southern areas. The clarinet plays a crucial role in saze (folk) ensembles that perform in weddings and other celebrations. It is worth mentioning that the kaba (an instrumental Albanian Isopolyphony included in UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list) is characteristic of these ensembles. Prominent Albanian clarinet players include Selim Leskoviku, Gaqo Lena, Remzi Lela (Çobani), Laver Bariu (Ustai), and Nevruz Nure (Lulushi i Korçës).|$|E
