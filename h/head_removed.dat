500|$|The {{composition}} of the scene juxtaposes the prim and proper Huguenot man and his immaculately dressed wife and son with these three, as they form their own [...] "family group" [...] across {{the other side of}} the gutter. The head of John the Baptist on a platter is the advertisement for the pie shop, proclaiming [...] "Good eating". Below this sign are the embracing couple, extending the metaphor of good eating beyond a mere plate of food, and still further down the street girl greedily scoops up the pie, carrying the theme to the foot of the picture. I. R. F. Gordon sees the vertical line of toppling plates from the top window downwards as a symbol of the disorder on this side of the street. The man reduced to a head on the sign, in what is assumed to be the woman's fantasy, is mirrored by the [...] "Good Woman" [...] pictured on the board behind who has only a body, her nagging <b>head</b> <b>removed</b> to create the man's ideal of a [...] "good woman". In the top window of the [...] "Good Woman", a woman throws a plate with a leg of meat into the street as she argues, providing a stark contrast to the [...] "good" [...] woman pictured on the sign below. Ronald Paulson sees the kite hanging from the church as part of a trinity of signs; the kite indicating the purpose of the church, an ascent into heaven, just as the other signs for [...] "Good Eating" [...] and the [...] "Good Woman" [...] indicate the predilections of those on that side of the street; but he also notes it as another nod to the pastoral tradition: here instead of soaring above the fields it hangs impotently on the church wall.|$|E
60|$|The scout's interest, to {{say nothing}} of surprise, was {{increased}} by what followed. When the short Turk, pointing a revolver at the prisoner's <b>head,</b> <b>removed</b> his hand so as to admit of speech, that prisoner's first utterance was an exclamation of astonishment in tones which were familiar to Petroff's ear. This was followed by exclamations of recognition from the Turks, and the short man seizing one of victim's tied hands shook it warmly.|$|E

60|$|An {{hour after}} leaving the village, as they were passing through a thick grove of trees some figures rose as from the ground. Ned was knocked off his horse by a blow with the {{butt-end}} of a gun; and Dick, before {{he had time to}} shout or make a movement in his defense, was dragged from his horse, his head wrapped in a thick cloth, and his arms bound. Then he could feel himself lifted up and rapidly carried off. After a time he was put on his legs and the covering of his <b>head</b> <b>removed.</b> He found Ned beside him; and a word of congratulation that both were alive was exchanged. Then a rope was placed round each of their necks, and surrounded by their captors, two of whom rode their horses, they were started at a run, with admonitions from those around them that any attempt to escape or to shout would be punished with instant death.|$|E
60|$|The scuttle-butt is a goodly, round, painted cask, {{standing}} on end, {{and with its}} upper <b>head</b> <b>removed,</b> showing a narrow, circular shelf within, where rest a number of tin cups for the accommodation of drinkers. Central, within the scuttle-butt itself, stands an iron pump, which, connecting with the immense water-tanks in the hold, furnishes an unfailing supply of the much-admired Pale Ale, first brewed in the brooks of the garden of Eden, and stamped with the brand of our old father Adam, who never knew what wine was. We are indebted to the old vintner Noah for that. The scuttle-butt is the only fountain in the ship; and here alone can you drink, unless at your meals. Night and day an armed sentry paces before it, bayonet in hand, to see that no water is taken away, except according to law. I wonder that they station no sentries at the port-holes, to see that no air is breathed, except according to Navy regulations.|$|E

50|$|Using {{electric}} {{tooth brushes}} is less complex {{in regards to}} brushing technique, making it a viable option for children, and adults with limited dexterity. The bristle head should be guided from tooth to tooth slowly, following the contour of the gums and crowns of the tooth. The motion of the toothbrush <b>head</b> <b>removes</b> the need to manually oscillate the brush or make circles.|$|R

5000|$|According to Herodotus, {{the manner}} of their {{sacrifice}} was to beat {{the head with a}} club and remove the head; then they either buried the body or threw it off a cliff, and lastly nailed the head to a cross. Prisoners of war likewise had their <b>heads</b> <b>removed,</b> and the <b>head</b> was then put onto a tall pole and placed at their house [...] "in order that the whole house may be under their protection".|$|R

500|$|Trout can {{be cooked}} {{as soon as}} they are cleaned, without scaling, {{skinning}} or filleting. If cooked with the skin on, the meat tends to hold together better. [...] While trout sold commercially in Europe is often prepared and served this way, most trout sold commercially in the U.S. have had <b>heads</b> <b>removed</b> and have been fully or partially deboned and filleted. Medium to heavy bodied white wines, such as chardonnay, sauvignon blanc or pinot gris are typical wine pairings for trout.|$|R

Two angel statues were also damaged. The statues have since been replaced or restored.|$|E

50|$|The village's name in Māori, ūpoko (head) ngaro (hidden), {{refers to}} a story of how chief's {{daughter}} Ira-nga-rangi arranged to have her <b>head</b> <b>removed</b> upon her death and hidden by relatives, who feared it might be desecrated by enemies. Supposedly the preserved head was hidden in a cave {{on the banks of}} the Ūpokongaro Stream north of the settlement, from which the village takes its name.|$|E
60|$|Here in this silent, sunless vault for many, {{many days}} Marcus lay sick {{with a brain}} fever, of which, {{had it not been}} for the skilful nursing of Nehushta and of the leeches among the Essenes, he must {{certainly}} have died. But these leeches, who were very clever, doctored the deep sword-cut in his <b>head,</b> <b>removing</b> with little iron hooks the fragments of bone which pressed upon his brain, and dressing that wound and another in his knee with salves.|$|R
50|$|In operation, {{the board}} to be jointed is held with its face against the fence and the edge to be jointed resting on the infeed table.

50|$|One minute is {{a common}} length of time for the commemoration, though other periods of time may be chosen, {{normally}} connected in some way with the event being commemorated (there might be a minute given for every death commemorated, for example). During the moment of silence, participants may typically bow their <b>heads,</b> <b>remove</b> hats, and refrain from speaking or moving places for the duration. A person officiating or presiding over the gathering {{will be responsible for}} the declaring and timing of the period of silence.|$|R

50|$|Gustav III died of {{his wounds}} on 29 March and on 16 April Anckarström was sentenced. He was {{stripped}} of his estates and nobility privileges.

60|$|An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin's <b>head,</b> <b>removing</b> his cap {{to replace}} it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, {{declared}} that Tarquin would be king of Rome.

Ahab's hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on and on with it; far {{in advance of the}} prow: and at last disappeared; while from the point of that disappearance, a minute black spot was dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into the sea.|$|R

50|$|Board {{is located}} by {{identify}} global fiducials on the PWB. Then the feeders {{pick up and}} center the components at a known distance from the component.

In the end, the component is placed at the correct X, Y and theta location with all leads ion the correct pads in contact with solder paste. The PWBs with all components correctly placed will then move to the reflow process.|$|R
