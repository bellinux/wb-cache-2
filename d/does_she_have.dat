500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} song was mostly positive. Robert Copsey from Digital Spy commended the balladry on Talk That Talk, paying particular attention to [...] "Fool in Love" [...] and [...] "Farewell", writing [...] "anyone questioning her motives need only hear ballads 'Farewell' and 'Fool in Love' to find out not only <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> a heart, but she's without doubt been putting all of it into these past six years." [...] Robert Everett-Green for The Globe and Mail praised the song, writing [...] "Fool in Love rings down the curtain with a towering anthem that somehow squeezes fresh feeling from a tired lyrical concept." [...] Katherine St Asaph for Popdust emoted a mixed response to [...] "Fool in Love", giving the song {{three and a half}} stars out of five and writing that it is [...] "so-bad-it's-good". St Aspash praised [...] "Fool in Love" [...] composition and musical influences, but criticized the song as not providing [...] "dynamic variety" [...] amongst Talk That Talk material.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 2 out of 4 stars, stating, [...] "The {{movie is a}} mess: a gassy costume epic with nobody at the center." [...] Ebert stated the film may have been {{educational}} for the test audience participants who wrote, [...] "Why <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> to die at the end?" [...] on their evaluation cards. In a review entitled Vivid Action Can't Save Miscast 'Joan, Todd McCarthy praised the film's action scenes and technical aspects, including Thierry Arbogast's cinematography, though overall gave a negative review. He criticised the casting of Jovovich, stating {{the only thing she}} brought to the film was [...] "her strikingly tall and skinny physicality, which is not exactly how one has been led to picture [...] ". Ron Wells from Film Threat, however, gave the film four out of five stars. Also praising the action scenes, Wells stated that the film's main strength was its [...] "adult ambiguities and relationships"; its decision not to portray Joan as a [...] "super-hero", but rather to let the audience decide whether she was a prophet or merely bipolar, concluding, [...] "This film, as most things that involve religion, is better understood if you learn not to take everything so literally." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of Kavner's roles {{have been}} {{described}} by New York Times writer Hilary de Vries as a [...] "woman who is supportive, sympathetic, or self-effacingly funny". Kavner grew to despise playing such roles, saying, [...] "If it smacks of Brenda Morgenstern, I won't take the job." [...] She had a supporting role as Eleanor Costello, a nurse who befriends Robin Williams' character in the Academy Award nominated film Awakenings. Kavner interviewed several nurses {{in preparation for the}} role, and Penny Marshall, the director of the film, described Kavner as [...] "a low-maintenance actor [...] You {{never have to worry about}} giving [...] back-story for her characters." [...] In 1992, Kavner starred in This Is My Life, her first leading role in a feature film. Kavner played Dottie Ingels, an aspiring stand-up comedian who starts neglecting her family when her career begins to take off. Kavner described Dottie as [...] "really selfish" [...] but admitted, [...] "I liked the role for that very reason." [...] Kavner had been asked to play a character with a smaller role in the film, but Joe Roth, at the time the chairman of 20th Century Fox, suggested that they cast a lesser known actress in the lead role. Nora Ephron, the writer of This Is My Life, said Kavner [...] "has so little vanity that it is almost shocking. Not only <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> no demands as an actress - 'How big is my trailer, what's in my refrigerator?' - but she will do anything for the character if it makes sense to her." ...|$|E

2500|$|The stage {{adaptation}} was Mailer's second [...] {{into the}} theater behind the adaptation of The Deer Park. The play takes its title from an FBI code name for Monroe. According to Mailer, Strawhead represents [...] "(Marilyn's) ironic, whimsical, tortured way of thinking." [...] Mailer sees the fictional Monroe character in the play as [...] "having an immensely dialectical mind; no sooner <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> a thought, than she comes on its opposite. That's the way life presents itself to her - in contrasts and sudden shifts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tallchief's {{popularity}} help {{grow the}} fledgeling dance company {{and she was}} asked to perform as many as eight times a week. [...] In 1954, Tallchief was given the role of Sugar Plum Fairy in Balanchine's newly reworked version of The Nutcracker, then an obscure ballet. Her performance of the role helped transform the work into an annual Christmas classic, and the industry's most reliable box-office draw. Critic Walter Terry remarked [...] "Maria Tallchief, as the Sugar Plum Fairy, is herself a creature of magic, dancing the seemingly impossible with effortless beauty of movement, electrifying us with her brilliance, enchanting us with her radiance of being. <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> any equals anywhere, inside or outside of fairyland? While watching her in The Nutcracker, one is tempted to doubt it." ...|$|E
