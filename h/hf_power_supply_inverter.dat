40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Although parametric devices have been known for many years, very little attention had {{been paid to the}} possibilities of exploiting the principles involved for low frequency power conversion purposes, until tfie recent advent of the parametric transformer. The theory of this device is developed in the thesis, and the unusual performance characteristics are explained. Possible application areas are discussed, for an assessment of the future potential of the device as a power-control element. The operation of the parametric transformer is considered initially {{on the basis of the}} Mathieu-Hill equations. The stability chart for these equations is extensively used to permit graphical interpretation of the behaviour and characteristics. As no complete theory exists for non-linear systems with time-varying parameters, other analytical methods are also considered, although since all of these regard the device as a parametric oscillator they throw little light an the inherent transformer action. By considering the parametric-transformer as a conventional saturable reactor with a capacitor connected across the load winding and the control winding driven from an alternating source, it can be placed within the perspective of non-linear magnetic devices already known. Many possible magnetic constructions with parallel and/or orthogonal flux. interactions are investigated, with special attention paid to the bridged magnetic core analogue of the two-C-core construction. The illustration of parametric coupling as a result of flux interaction in saturable reactor devices leads to a derivation of the overall equations directly from the physical system. The functions representing the magnetic structure of the parametric transformer are first evaluated graphically, ard using various analytical representations of the B/H curve their explicit expressions are then formulated for different magnetic configurations. The introduction into the study of the concept of a relative magnetisation curve is invaluable in explaining the current waveforms and many other aspects of the device. A mathematical model is established for the parametric transformer and the system equations are solved numerically by a digital computer. The voltage and current waveforms and performance characteristics are demonstrated, and the correctness of the theory is ascertained by comparison with experimental results. Based on considerations of losses and efficiency, the advantages and disadvantages of parametric transformers are discussed. Possible applications in such areas as <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> <b>inverters</b> and converters are viewed and examples are given...|$|R
40|$|Transmission of {{electrical}} power through high voltage direct current (HVDC) has {{attracted the attention}} of a number of researchers in the recent years. For economic design and optimal operation, HVDC system requires a detailed simulation model. Therefore, in this paper a detailed Matlab simulation model of line commutated converter (LCC) based monpolar HVDC system, feeding a strong AC network, with a fixed capacitor (FC) as a reactive power compensator is presented. Firefly algorithm based optimal proportional integral (PI) controller has been proposed for the rectifier and the inverter control. The transient performances of the HVDC system under various AC and DC fault conditions were studied. The results show the supremacy of the firefly algorithm based optimal PI controller over the conventional PI controller. The harmonic analysis is also carried out under steady state operation to assure the quality of <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> on the <b>inverter</b> AC side...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Active Power Filters (APFs) {{are today}} {{the most widely}} used systems to {{eliminate}} harmonics compensate power factor and correct unbalanced problems in industrial power plants. We propose to improve the performances of conventional APFs by using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for harmonics estimation. This new method combines both the strategies for extracting the three-phase reference currents for active power filters and DC link voltage control method. The ANNs learning capabilities to adaptively choose the power system parameters for both to compute the reference currents and to recharge the capacitor value requested by VDC voltage in order to ensure suitable transit of <b>powers</b> to <b>supply</b> the <b>inverter.</b> To investigate the performance of this identification method, the study has been accomplished using simulation with the MATLAB Simulink Power System Toolbox. The simulation study results of the new (SAPF) identification technique compared to other similar methods are found quite satisfactory by assuring good filtering characteristics and high system stability...|$|R
