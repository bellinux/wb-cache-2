40|$|AbstractObjectives: We prospectively {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} head position during cardiac <b>deairing</b> on the Doppler ultrasonography–detected cerebral microemboli in children and the association between the embolic counts and the clinical assessment of <b>deairing.</b> Methods: Children requiring exposure of the systemic ventricle under cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized to Trendelenburg (– 15 °) and horizontal (0 °) head positions during and after standard surgical <b>deairing.</b> Complexity of repair was categorized as follows: group I consisted of single simple lesions, and group II consisted of multiple complex lesions. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography identified high-intensity transient signals in the right middle cerebral artery within the first 5 minutes after aortic declamping (release) and from this ending period until cardiopulmonary bypass termination (residual). Electrocardiographic alterations after <b>deairing</b> were documented. A predefined 5 -point scale {{was used by the}} surgeon for blinded assessment of <b>deairing.</b> Results: High-intensity transient signals were identified in 97 % of 128 patients (aged 5 days to 17 years). The median total high-intensity transient signal count was 60 (25 th- 75 th quartiles, 14 - 189). Head position or surgeon did not affect the rate of high-intensity transient signals (P >. 20). During the residual interval, occurrence of HITS in group I was less than that in group II (P <. 05), but there was no difference at release. The incidence of high-intensity transient signals and electrocardiographic alterations correlated with the clinical assessment of <b>deairing</b> (P <. 01). Conclusions: Trendelenburg head position as a complement of cardiac <b>deairing</b> in children does not decrease the cerebral microembolic load compared with the horizontal head position. The cerebral microembolic count and the occurrence of electrocardiographic alterations usually increases when the surgeon is less confident in the efficacy of <b>deairing.</b> (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2001; 121 : 3 - 9...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe aims of {{this study}} were first to analyze neurocognitive {{outcomes}} of patients after open-chamber cardiac surgery to determine whether carbon dioxide pericardial insufflation reduces incidence of neurocognitive decline (primary end point) as measured 6 weeks postoperatively and second to assess the utility of carbon dioxide insufflation in cardiac chamber <b>deairing</b> as assessed by transesophageal echocardiography. MethodsA multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial compared neurocognitive outcomes in patients undergoing open-chamber (left-sided) cardiac surgery who were assigned carbon dioxide insufflation or placebo (control group) in addition to standardized mechanical <b>deairing</b> maneuvers. ResultsOne hundred twenty-five patients underwent surgery and were randomly allocated. Neurocognitive testing showed no clinically significant differences in z scores between preoperative and postoperative testing. Linear regression was used to identify factors associated with neurocognitive decline. Factors most strongly associated with neurocognitive decline were hypercholesterolemia, aortic atheroma grade, and coronary artery disease. There was significantly more intracardiac gas noted on intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in all cardiac chambers (left atrium, left ventricle, and aorta) at all measured times (after crossclamp removal, during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, and at declaration of adequate <b>deairing</b> by the anesthetist) in the control group than in the carbon dioxide group (P < . 04). <b>Deairing</b> time was also significantly longer in the control group (12 minutes [interquartile range, 9 – 18] versus 9 minutes [interquartile range, 7 – 14 minutes]; P = . 002). ConclusionsCarbon dioxide pericardial insufflation in open-chamber cardiac surgery does not affect postoperative neurocognitive decline. The most important factor is atheromatous vascular disease...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective: In cardiac surgery, {{insufflation}} {{of carbon}} dioxide is used for <b>deairing</b> {{of the heart and}} great vessels. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess a new insufflation device for efficient <b>deairing</b> and to study the influence of suction. Methods: We measured the content of remaining air at two positions in the cardiothoracic wound model. A new insufflation device, a gas diffuser, was compared with a conventional 0. 25 -inch tube. Carbon dioxide flow (5 and 10 L/min) and suction (0, 1. 5, 10, and 25 L/min) were varied. Suction was studied in combination with the gas diffuser. Results: With the tube the median air content in the wound model was 19. 5 % to 51. 7 % at the studied carbon dioxide flows, whereas with the gas diffuser the median air content was no greater than 1. 2 % at 5 L/min and no greater than 0. 31 % at 10 L/min (P <. 001). When suction of 1. 5 L/min was applied, the median air content in the model remained low (≤ 1. 0 %) at both carbon dioxide flows. With suction of 10 L/min the median air content was still low (≤ 0. 50 %) at a simultaneous carbon dioxide flow of 10 L/min. Conversely, suction of 25 L/min caused a marked increase in air content at carbon dioxide flows of both 5 and 10 L/min (P <. 001). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the most efficient <b>deairing</b> (≤ 1 % remaining air) in a cardiothoracic wound model was provided by a gas diffuser at a carbon dioxide flow of 10 L/min. A conventional 0. 25 -inch tube failed to do so (19. 5 %- 51. 7 % remaining air). Additional suction deteriorated air displacement with the gas diffuser when suction exceeded carbon dioxide inflow.

40|$|AbstractNeither {{antegrade}} nor retrograde cardioplegic protection provides homogeneous distribution, and {{a combination}} {{may be required}} to avoid anaerobic metabolism and depressed postoperative ventricular function. Tepid cardioplegia (29 ° C) avoids the delayed recovery of cardiac function and metabolism associated with cold cardioplegia (15 ° C) and reduces the anaerobic metabolism seen with warm (37 ° C) cardioplegia. We compared two techniques that combine antegrade and retrograde tepid cardioplegia: alternate and simultaneous. Methods: Sixty patients undergoing elective isolated coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized to receive near continuous tepid retrograde and either intermittent antegrade cardioplegia (the alternate technique) or antegrade cardioplegia with the solution delivered concurrently through each completed vein graft (the simultaneous technique). Results: Myocardial lactate extraction was greater after crossclamp release following simultaneous than alternate cardioplegia. Postoperative ventricular function was better after alternate than simultaneous cardioplegia. Conclusion: Both techniques permitted rapid postoperative recovery of myocardial metabolism and ventricular function. However, simultaneous cardioplegia was simpler and did not require <b>deairing</b> the aortic root between antegrade infusions. (J THORAC CARDIOVASC SURG 1996; 112 : 787 - 96...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{roles of}} fabrics in subdrains are {{identified}} for normal groundwater flow conditions to determine hydraulic and pore characteristics necessary for design considerations. Two conditions are discussed: (1) the fabric in {{direct contact with}} the soil to provide mechanical support, and (2) the fabric as a filter to remove soil particles in suspension in water. If direct contact is maintained between the soil and fabric, control of the hydraulic gradient and/or pore size will prevent soil migration and fabric plugging by soil particles. If toe fabric is a filter in t:ne sense that it removes soil particles suspended in water, the fabric will plug. For tnis case a method of controlling piping of suspended soil particles by relating a soil grain size to the coefficient of fabric permeability is proposed. Relationships between a soil grain size, the soil Reynolds number, and the soil cake porosity are suggested as means of evaluating the effect of fabric plugging and soil cake formation. An experimental design is Proposed to evaluate the applicability of the proposed equations for the critical hydraulic gradient and the control of plugging and piping. Air permeability and falling head water permeability tests were performed. The falling head test provided for water and fabric <b>deairing.</b> Turbulence was found to exist when testing one layer of fabric but laminar flow was indicated when testing multiple layers. Comparison between air and water permeability test results indicates that either method can predict fabric permeability with satisfactory accuracy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{objective}} was to assess mitral valve replacement in a minimally invasive fashion by means of port-access technology. Methods: Fifteen dogs, 28 ± 3 kg (mean ± standard deviation), were studied with the port-access mitral valve replacement system (Heartport, Inc., Redwood City, Calif.). Eleven dogs underwent acute studies and were sacrificed immediately after the procedure. Four dogs were allowed to recover and then were sacrificed 4 weeks after operation. Cardiopulmonary bypass was conducted by femoral cannulation with an endovascular balloon catheter for aortic occlusion, root venting, and antegrade delivery of cardioplegic solution. Catheters were inserted in the jugular vein for pulmonary artery venting and retrograde delivery of cardioplegic solution. Through the oval port, a prosthesis (St. Jude Medical, Inc., St. Paul, Minn., or CarboMedics, Inc., Austin, Texas) was inserted through the left atrial appendage and secured to the anulus with sutures. <b>Deairing</b> was performed. Results: Cardiopulmonary bypass duration was 114 ± 24 minutes and aortic crossclamp time was 68 ± 14 minutes. All animals were weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass in sinus rhythm. Cardiac output and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure were unchanged (2. 8 ± 0. 7 L/min and 7 ± 3 mm Hg before operation vs 2. 6 ± 0. 6 L/min and 9 ± 4 mm Hg after operation). There was no mitral regurgitation according to left ventriculography in 13 of 15 dogs. In two dogs there was interference with prosthetic valve closure by residual native anterior leaflet tissue. Pathologic examination otherwise showed normal healing without perivalvular discontinuity. Microscopic studies showed no damage to the valve surfaces. Transthoracic echocardiography of the four dogs in the long-term study showed normal ventricular and prosthetic valve function 4 weeks after the operation. Conclusion: Mitral valve replacement with a minimally invasive method has been demonstrated in dogs. A clinical trial is in progress. (J THORAC CARDIOVASC SURG 1996; 112 : 1268 - 74...|$|R
30|$|At the surgery, a {{standard}} re-sternotomy was performed paying {{careful attention to}} avoid any injury to mediastinal structures. The living grafts including LITA-LAD, GEA-posterior descending artery, and SVG-LCX were dissected completely freely from adhesion with surrounding tissue, and the adhesion of the heart was completely freed from the pericardium. A cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established by the cannulation to the ascending aorta and to the superior and inferior vena cava respectively, and the left ventricular venting tube was inserted from the right upper pulmonary vein. First and foremost, a new SVG was anastomosed to the mid-portion of the RCA. The ascending aorta was cross-clamped, and the in situ grafts of LITA and GEA were also clamped simultaneously. The initial cardioplegia was infused antegradely from the aortic root and the SVG anastomosed to the RCA, after which the retrograde cardioplegia infusion from the coronary sinus was followed additionally. Topical cooling with ice slush was employed for myocardial protection as well. The ascending aorta was incised obliquely below the proximal anastomosis of the previous SVG to the LCX. The aortic valve was exposed and all three cusps were thickened and densely calcified; their mobility was almost completely lost and the valve area was strictly restricted. The aortic valve was excised and replaced with a 19 -mm bioprosthesis. During these procedures, the second cardioplegia was infused from the left coronary orifice, the orifice of the SVG to LCX and the temporary SVG to the RCA antegradely, after which the retrograde cardioplegia was followed as well. The aortotomy was closed, and the clamps of the ascending aorta and living in situ grafts were released under <b>deairing</b> from the LV vent and the aortic root. Once normal sinus rhythm was restored, the patient could be weaned off CPB without much difficulty. The SVG to the RCA was tied off. The durations of the operation, CPB, and the aortic clamp time were 346, 164, and 88  min, respectively. The creatine kinase-MB level on the first postoperative day rose up to 263.4  ng/ml, but a new asynergy of left ventricular wall motion was not recognized. The postoperative transthoracic echocardiography showed the prosthetic valve functioning well with the AVA of 2.06  cm 2 and the transvalvular peak pressure gradient of 15.3  mmHg. The patient went along with an uneventful recovery course and was discharged on the 15 postoperative days. She was reviewed at our outpatient department 1  month after the discharge and found to be asymptomatic.|$|R
