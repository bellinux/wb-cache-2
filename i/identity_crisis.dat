5|$|In 1999, {{the band}} self-released an EP titled First Impressions {{which was the}} product of a two-day session at A-Room Studios with Brian Tochilin. Only 1,000 copies were made and the band members sold them out of their cars. Working with Death by Stereo's Paul Miner, the quartet {{recorded}} 12 tracks, and by April 2000, the group had released <b>Identity</b> <b>Crisis</b> on Greenflag Records. A portion of the album's proceeds were donated to a local charity called Crittenton Services for Children and Families. More support gigs and local buzz followed, and Thrice sparked the interest of Hopeless/Sub City's Louis Posen. In 2001, Posen signed with the band, reissued <b>Identity</b> <b>Crisis,</b> and sent the group out on tour with Samiam. Tours with Midtown and Hot Rod Circuit followed.|$|E
5|$|The {{first story}} {{arc of the}} Mega Man comic series adapts the {{original}} Mega Man game, though with certain artistic liberties, such as Dr. Wily's robot factory reusing the design of Mega Man 2s Wily Castle, Mega Man becoming obsessed with stopping the reprogrammed Robot Masters {{to the point of}} having an <b>identity</b> <b>crisis,</b> and Dr. Light mistaking a Sniper Joe controlled by Dr. Wily for Proto Man.|$|E
5|$|In {{her book}} {{column for the}} Detroit Free Press, Marta Salij said that Cal's <b>identity</b> <b>crisis</b> resembles Odysseus's fate. Whereas the mythical hero is troubled by Poseidon and succored by Athena, the {{intersex}} protagonist is affected by his chromosomes in a similar manner. John Sykes, professor of English and religion education, noted another Greek-hero reference. In {{a manner similar to}} Oedipus's fulfillment of Pythia's prophecy to slay his father and marry his mother, Callie validates the prediction her grandmother made before her birth by adopting a male identity. Eugenides also used the allusions to Greek mythology and modern pop music to show the passing of familial traits and idiosyncrasies {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E

5|$|The overall {{gameplay}} received mixed reviews. Some critics {{believed that}} the gameplay was enjoyable, serviceable and acceptable by modern standards, but most others agreed {{that some of the}} gameplay mechanics, such as the cover system, lacked polish and were flawed. Some critics considered the gameplay generic due to its inclusion of typical shooter elements such as on-rail and turret segments, and stated that such mechanics are unable to help the game differentiate itself from other shooters such as Gears of War, and give the game an <b>identity</b> <b>crisis.</b> Some critics lamented that gameplay occasionally disconnects players from the story, creating tonal dissonance. Many criticized the game for not having a roll mechanic. The artificial intelligence system was criticized for not being strong enough to make the game more gratifying, though some critics thought that the AI system for Adams and Lugo was well-crafted and did not suffer from severe or frequent technical problems, although {{they may not be able}} to carry out player's commands. Some critics criticized the game's low replay value, unbalanced difficulty level, and sudden difficulty spike.|$|E
5|$|Within the Lifestream, Tifa helps Cloud {{reconstruct}} his memories. Cloud {{was never}} accepted into SOLDIER, instead becoming a low-ranking infantryman. The SOLDIER in his memories was his friend Zack. At Nibelheim, Cloud was injured, but fatally wounded Sephiroth, who only survived due to Jenova. Cloud and Zack were then taken for experiments by Hojo, with Zack escaping {{four years later}} with a catatonic Cloud. The two were eventually cornered by Shinra soldiers, and Zack was killed; the combined trauma of his experience, the experiments and Zack's death triggered an <b>identity</b> <b>crisis,</b> with Cloud constructing a false persona around Zack's stories and his own fantasies. Realizing and accepting his past, Cloud recovers and together with Tifa reunites with the party. It is revealed that Aerith's prayer to the Planet was successful: the Planet had attempted to summon Holy to prevent Meteor's impact, but Sephiroth blocked Holy. After killing Hojo {{when he tries to}} aid Sephiroth, who is revealed to be Hojo's biological son, the party descends into the Planet's core and defeats both Jenova and Sephiroth. The party escapes and Holy is summoned, attempting to block Meteor as it descends on Midgar. As Meteor is too close, Holy cannot block it, but the Lifestream rises from the planet and aids Holy in destroying Meteor. Five hundred years later, Red XIII is seen with two cubs looking out over the ruins of Midgar, which are now covered in greenery, showing the planet has healed.|$|E

25|$|One more studio album, <b>Identity</b> <b>Crisis,</b> was {{recorded}} during 1980–81 but was only released in West Germany and Mexico. Sweet undertook a short {{tour of the}} UK and performed their last live show at Glasgow University on 20 March 1981. Steve Priest {{then returned to the}} United States, where he had been living since late 1979. Shortly after his return to the US, Steve Priest remarried, ending any hopes of a return to the UK. When Polydor released <b>Identity</b> <b>Crisis</b> in October 1982, the original Sweet had been disbanded for almost a year.|$|E

25|$|In {{an article}} for the Daily Mail, Nawaz notes how self-segregation has created Muslim {{communities}} in London where third-generation teenagers are growing up without having any non-Muslim friends, or friends from the opposite sex. He notes how their lives revolve around faith schools, mosque, Islamic extracurricular activities and cultural events involving members of the Muslim community only. Without any exposure to the complexities of modern life, he argues, such teens are susceptible to simplistic worldviews and dogma. On an individual level, Nawaz maps a person's path to radicalisation with four key stages: grievances, <b>identity</b> <b>crisis,</b> charismatic recruiter and ideology. It begins {{with a sense of}} real or perceived grievances, which leads to an <b>identity</b> <b>crisis.</b> This condition is then capitalised on by a recruiter from an organisation who lays out the ideology as a solution to that individual's alienation.|$|E

25|$|His father Calvin, a {{successful}} tax attorney, gently leans {{on him to}} make appointments to see a local psychiatrist, Dr. Tyrone Berger.

Also helping is a relationship with a new girlfriend, Jeannine Pratt.|$|E
25|$|His elder brother, pseudonymously {{named as}} Osman, was {{recruited}} into Hizb ut-Tahrir by Nasim Ghani, {{who would later}} become the UK leader of Hizb ut-Tahrir. Osman subsequently persuaded Nawaz to attend HT meetings held in Southend homes. At those meetings, recruits were shown videos that depicted Bosnian Muslims being massacred. With his <b>identity</b> <b>crisis</b> lurking in the background, these videos became the catalyst for Nawaz's formal recruitment in the HT.|$|E

The present study focuses on globalization {{and its consequences}} on socio-cultural andpsychological identity among Pakhtuns belonging to Malakand Division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan. Total samples of 100 teachers were selected from two strata (three universities andeight colleges) of Malakand Division.

25|$|Recently, {{there has}} been an {{identity}} struggle among the younger generations of Inuit, between their traditional heritage and the modern society which their cultures have been forced to assimilate into in order to maintain a livelihood. With current dependence on modern society for necessities, (including governmental jobs, food, aid, medicine, etc.), the Inuit have had much interaction with and exposure to the societal norms outside their previous cultural boundaries. The stressors regarding the <b>identity</b> <b>crisis</b> among teenagers have led to disturbingly high numbers of suicide.|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of HIV/AIDS among the youths who constitute about {{twenty-five percent of}} the world population draws attention to the challenge of addressing the needs of secondary school students where a very large cluster of the youths can be found. This paper thus examines problems of youths who appear very vulnerable to HIV/AIDS {{as a result of the}} socio-emotional pressures attached to adolescence, a developmental stage characterized by <b>identity</b> <b>crises.</b> The paper submits that the Social Studies teacher would play a very significant role in resolving the <b>identity</b> <b>crises</b> of secondary school students under their tutelage, if they carefully plan their classroom instructions to clarify the values held by their students; and as a result, the students will avoid HIV/AIDS risk-related practises, lead lives devoid of diseases and avoid injuries and by that, live longer and achieve their life goals...|$|R
25|$|The American Revolution was a {{difficult}} time for the Anglican Church in America. Clergymen were divided between allegiance to their king and their state. As public officials, ministers were required to swear loyalty to the state, breaking the Oath of Supremacy in the process. Some {{were able to do}} this, but those who could not either resigned or withdrew from parish duties while continuing to provide pastoral care. There were calls for dis-establishment, but powerful church members resisted drastic change. In 1777, the legislature passed bills recognizing the church's right to its property and the right of the clergy to occupy the glebes. Clerical salaries were suspended and ended entirely in 1780. Thus for much of the war the Anglican Church faced an <b>identity</b> <b>crisis.</b> It was a state church controlled by a government refusing to fund it. The war also led to the breakdown of the vestry system as refugees strained parish resources and desperate vestrymen resigned or petitioned the state to dissolve their vestries.|$|E
