International audienceThis report {{analyses}} {{the genetic}} underpinnings of {{the proportions of}} the hippocampal <b>terminal</b> <b>fields</b> in the mouse at the midseptotemporal level.

40|$|Afferent {{information}} {{derived from}} oral chemoreceptors is transmitted to second-order neurons in the rostral solitary tract nucleus (rNST) and then relayed to other CNS locations responsible for complex sensory and motor behaviors. Here we investigate {{the characteristics of}} rNST neurons sending information rostrally to the parabrachial nucleus (PBN). Afferent connections to these rNST-PBN projection neurons were identified by anterograde labeling of the chorda tympani (CT), glossopharyngeal (IX), and lingual (LV) nerves. We used voltage- and current-clamp recordings in brain slices to characterize the expression of both the transient A-type potassium current, IKA and the hyperpolarization-activated inward current, Ih, important determinants of neuronal repetitive discharge characteristics. The majority of rNST-PBN neurons express IKA, and these IKA-expressing neurons predominate in CT and IX <b>terminal</b> <b>fields</b> but were expressed in {{approximately half of the}} neurons in the LV field. rNST-PBN neurons expressing Ih were evenly distributed among CT, IX and LV <b>terminal</b> <b>fields.</b> However, expression patterns of IKA and Ih differed among CT, IX, and LV fields. IKA-expressing neurons frequently coexpress Ih in CT and IX <b>terminal</b> <b>fields,</b> whereas neurons in LV <b>terminal</b> <b>field</b> often express only Ih. After GABAA receptor block all rNST-PBN neurons responded to afferent stimulation with all-or-none excitatory synaptic responses. rNST-PBN neurons had either multipolar or elongate morphologies and were distributed throughout the rNST, but multipolar neurons were more often encountered in CT and IX <b>terminal</b> <b>fields.</b> No correlation was found between the biophysical and morphological characteristics of the rNST-PBN projection neurons in each <b>terminal</b> <b>field...</b>|$|R
40|$|Anterograde {{labeling}} {{techniques were}} used to examine peripheral innervation patterns of vestibular efferent neurons in the crista ampullares of the gerbil. Vestibular efferent neurons were labeled by extracellular injections of biocytin or biotinylated dextran amine into the contralateral or ipsilateral dorsal subgroup of efferent cell bodies (group e) located dorsolateral to the facial nerve genu. Anterogradely labeled efferent <b>terminal</b> <b>field</b> varicosities consist mainly of boutons en passant with fewer of the terminal type. The bouton swellings are located predominately in apposition to the basolateral borders of the afferent calyces and type II hair cells, but several boutons were identified close to the hair cell apical border on both types. Three-dimensional reconstruction and morphological analysis of the <b>terminal</b> <b>fields</b> from these cells located in the sensory neuroepithelium of the anterior, horizontal, and posterior cristae were performed. We show that efferent neurons densely innervate each end organ in widespread <b>terminal</b> <b>fields.</b> Subepithelial bifurcations of parent axons were minimal, with extensive collateralization occurring after the axons penetrated the basement membrane of the neuroepithelium. Axonal branching ranged between the 6 th and 27 th orders and <b>terminal</b> <b>field</b> collecting area far exceeds that of the peripheral terminals of primary afferent neurons. The <b>terminal</b> <b>fields</b> of the efferent neurons display three morphologically heterogeneous types: central, peripheral, and planum. All cell types possess <b>terminal</b> <b>fields</b> displaying {{a high degree of}} anisotropy with orientations typically parallel to or within +/- 45 degrees of the longitudinal axis if the crista. <b>Terminal</b> <b>fields</b> of the central and planum zones predominately project medially toward the transverse axis from the more laterally located penetration of the basement membrane by the parent axon. Peripheral zone <b>terminal</b> <b>fields</b> extend predominately toward the planum semilunatum. The innervation areas of efferent <b>terminal</b> <b>fields</b> display a trend from smallest to largest for the central, peripheral, and planum types, respectively. Neurons that innervate the central zone of the crista do not extend into the peripheral or planum regions. Conversely, those neurons with <b>terminal</b> <b>fields</b> in the peripheral or planum regions do not innervate the central zone of the sensory neuroepithelium. The central zone of the crista is innervated preferentially by efferent neurons with cell bodies located in the ipsilateral group e. The peripheral and planum zones of the crista are innervated preferentially by efferent neurons with cell bodies located in the contralateral group e. A model incorporating our anatomic observations is presented describing an ipsilateral closed-loop feedback between ipsilateral efferent neurons and the periphery and an open-loop feed-forward innervation from contralateral efferent neurons. A possible role for the vestibular efferent neurons in the modulation of semicircular canal afferent response dynamics is proposed...|$|R
