50|$|Citizen {{also built}} an {{automatic}} quartz powered watch, the Citizen Promaster Eco-Duo Drive (released in December 1998). Novel to this watch {{was the use}} of both mechanical power as well as a solar cell to power the <b>electronic</b> <b>movement</b> and charge the secondary power cell. This model was an attempt to enter higher-priced markets (at a cost of around $1,000 USD). The Eco-Duo Drive technology failed to attract consumer interest and Citizen has since stopped making use of the unique movement.|$|E

50|$|A {{movement}} of a watch is the mechanism that measures {{the passage of}} time and displays the current time (and possibly other information including date, month and day). Movements may be entirely mechanical, entirely electronic (potentially with no moving parts), or they might be a blend of both. Most watches intended mainly for timekeeping today have <b>electronic</b> <b>movements,</b> with mechanical hands on the watch face indicating the time.|$|R
50|$|Compared to <b>electronic</b> <b>movements,</b> {{mechanical}} watches {{are less}} accurate, often with errors of seconds per day, {{and they are}} sensitive to position, temperature and magnetism. They are also costly to produce, require regular maintenance and adjustments, and {{are more prone to}} failures. Nevertheless, the craftsmanship of mechanical watches still attracts interest from part of the watch-buying public, especially among the watch collectors. Skeleton watches are designed to leave the mechanism visible for aesthetic purposes.|$|R
5000|$|Fixed coil system, contact controlled: watches with a {{piece of}} refined iron {{attached}} to the balance wheel, a fixed coil and mechanical contacts. In order to extend the life of the watch, some of these movements included a diode to minimize sparking on the contacts. Examples of this technology are Lip electronic R 27, LIP R 148, Elgin electronic 722, 725, 910 which were the smallest <b>electronic</b> <b>movements</b> ever made and Landeron (ESA - Ebauches S.A.) 4750.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the <b>electronic</b> <b>movement,</b> a {{fully charged}} {{secondary}} power cell could run with no further charging from 30 days to 3,175 days (8.7 years), though most Eco-Drive men's watch models offer a six-month power reserve. If kept from light {{for an extended}} period, some Eco-Drive movement models can hibernate, where {{the hands of the}} watch stop and the internal quartz movement continues to track the correct time. When subsequently exposed to sufficient light, the hands move automatically (without human intervention) to the proper positions and resume regular timekeeping.|$|E

50|$|Citizen Eco-Drive Thermo watches were {{introduced}} in 1999 and use the temperature difference between the wearer's arm and the surrounding environment as a power source. The rare Eco-Drive Thermo watches use the Seebeck effect to generate thermo electricity that powers the <b>electronic</b> <b>movement</b> and charges the secondary power cell. In the sun or in the tropics the ambient temperature can come close to or exceed {{the temperature of the}} wearer's wrist causing the watch to stop generating thermo electricity. In case no power is generated, an Eco-Drive Thermo movement will save power by moving the second hand in ten second increments until the production of thermo electricity is resumed. Citizen has stopped making Eco-Drive Thermo watches.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1970s, Universal {{had been}} one of the few Swiss watch brands to {{introduce}} a quartz movement and phase out automatics, coinciding with an era now known as the [...] "quartz crisis". While the company continued to use silver, gold, platinum and diamonds for its dials, cases, bands and bracelets, the switch to quartz oscillators was a cost-efficient alternative to automatic complications, which were considerably more expensive and more time-consuming to produce, and could not compete with the mass-produced growth of <b>electronic</b> <b>movements.</b> In particular, the Golden and White Shadows, which previously contained microtors, would be replaced with unisonics and accutrons.|$|R
50|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>movements,</b> {{also known}} as quartz movements, have few or no moving parts, except a quartz crystal which is made to vibrate by the {{piezoelectric}} effect.

40|$|Amino acid {{substitution}} matrices {{are essential}} tools for protein sequence analysis, ho-mology sequence search in protein databases and multiple sequence alignment. The PAM matrix {{was the first}} widely used amino acid substitution matrix. The BLOSUM se-ries then succeeded the PAM matrix. Most substitution matrixes were developed by us-ing the statistical frequency of substitution between each amino acid at blocks repre-senting groups of protein families or related proteins.

In this study, a new approach was used to obtain major physiochemical properties in multiple sequence alignment.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The thermal {{conductivity}} of titanium aluminide and several ruthenium-aluminium alloys {{has been studied}} from room temperature up to 500 °C. Ruthenium aluminide is a B 2 -type intermetallic which is unusual and of special interest because of its toughness, specific strength and stiffness, oxidation resistance and low cost.

40|$|In {{recent years}} we have seen an {{enormous}} increase in electronic device capabilities as users demand new and improved features in a smaller form factor. As a result, the power demands of these electronics are increasing at an exponentially large rate such that lithium ion-battery (LIB) technology is rapidly becoming obsolete. Tesla motors and other electric vehicle manufacturers are pushing the limit of their technology as vehicles approach 300 miles per charge. Subsequently, battery technology must evolve {{in tandem with the}} rapid improvements made on current technology. The lithium-sulphur battery (LIS) stands as a promising candidate for future energy storage needs. As an old technology thought to be too difficult to implement, LIS technology has been rediscovered as researchers across the globe race to successfully implement this technology. A typical LIS consists of a lithium anode and sulphur cathode. The sulphur component allows for increased energy density over LIB technology. Sulphur is capable of bonding to lithium at much greater ratios than LIB cathodes. With a theoretical energy density five times higher than that of LIB, LIS has the potential to replace LIB as the new energy storage standard. In order to successfully implement LIS, several inherent shortcomings must be properly dealt with. Firstly, sulphur is an insulating material, effectively restricting <b>electronic</b> <b>movement</b> towards reaction areas in the cell. Secondly, the deposition of sulphur based by-products due to the electrochemical reactions which occur between lithium and sulphur create highly insulating areas resulting in poor electrochemical performance. Attempts to remedy these issues typically take form as modifications to select components of the battery, namely the composition or structure of the electrolyte, electrodes and the separator. It has been shown that nanoporous carbon materials are an excellent cathode option for increasing LIS battery performance as a result of increased sulphur uptake and decreased PS diffusion. This thesis will describe the development of a porous, carbonaceous material to be used as the cell cathode to improve performance. Herein, carbon spheres were synthesized as the cathode material sulphur host. These spheres are approximately 500 nm in diameter and are air treated to greatly increase pore volume to promote PS retention and increase sulphur loading. The assembled cell using the air treated sample was shown to have a capacity of approximately 1100 mAh g^- 1 with an 81 % capacity retention versus the non-treated sample with a capacity of 700 mAh g^- 1 and 68 % retention...|$|E

There are many versions of the movement including manual wind 2414 and 2428 (double date)and self-winding 2416 and 2427 (double date).
