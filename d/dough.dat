5000|$|<b>Doughs</b> {{with higher}} fat content have a lesser water content, develop less gluten and are {{therefore}} generally less elastic than bread doughs; these <b>doughs</b> are often called [...] "short" [...] by bakers. This category includes many cookie and pie crust <b>doughs,</b> such as shortcrust pastry.|$|R
5000|$|Stiff <b>doughs,</b> such as {{pie crust}} and sugar cookie <b>doughs,</b> have a liquid to dry ratio of about 1:8. Stiff <b>doughs</b> {{are easy to}} work in that they only {{minimally}} stick to work surfaces, including tools and hands. Also called [...] "high-ratio" [...] baked good.|$|R
5|$|Another kashrut {{challenge}} {{which the}} bakery overcame {{in the early}} 1950s concerned the ability to produce fresh bread for sale on Sunday mornings after the plant had been closed for Shabbat in accordance with Jewish law. Normally <b>dough</b> takes four to six hours to rise, but the bakery acquired a mixer made by Tweedy of Burnley, England, which could produce <b>dough</b> in only two hours, thus allowing the bakery to bake bread on Saturday night in time for Sunday-morning deliveries. Today Angel Bakeries owns nine such mixers, five of which are used in its Jerusalem plant.|$|E

50|$|Rugelach can be {{made with}} sour cream or cream cheese <b>doughs,</b> but there are also pareve {{variants}} with no dairy ingredients, {{so that it can be}} eaten with or after a meat meal and still be kosher.

40|$|The {{effects on}} {{addition}} of {{three kinds of}} fats and oils to <b>doughs</b> were investigated with baking quality and microstructure.

40|$|Yeasts were {{isolated}} {{from a variety}} of home-made bread <b>doughs</b> and identified. A pure culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was found in 18 %of the <b>doughs.</b> The same species predominated in 80 % of the <b>doughs</b> examined whereas Issatchenkia orientalis, Pichia membranaefaciens and Torulaspora delbrueckii were present in about 40 % of the samples. About one quarter of the isolates displayed killer activity, strains of P. anomala showing the broadest spectra. Two isolates of S. cerevisiae and three of T. delbrueckii gave biomass values in sucrose medium similar to or higher than those obtained with commercial compressed baker´s yeast strains...|$|R
5|$|In ancient Egypt, cattle {{were the}} most {{important}} livestock, and sheep, goats, and pigs were also kept; poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with <b>dough</b> to fatten them.

5|$|There is {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of home baking in Israel arising from the years when {{there were very few}} bakeries to meet demand. Many professional bakers came to Israel from Central Europe and founded local pastry shops and bakeries, often called konditoria, thus shaping local tastes and preferences. There is now a local style with a wide selection of cakes and pastries that includes influences from other cuisines and combines traditional European ingredients with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern ingredients, such as halva, phyllo <b>dough,</b> dates, and rose water.|$|E
