25|$|A 1982 {{paper by}} George Maxwell, Sphere Packings and Hyperbolic Reflection Groups, enumerates the finite list of Lorentzian of rank 5 to 11. <b>He</b> <b>calls</b> <b>them</b> level 2, meaning removal any {{permutation}} of 2 nodes leaves a finite or Euclidean graph. His enumeration is complete, but didn't list graphs {{that are a}} subgroup of another. All higher-order branch Coxeter groups of rank-4 are Lorentzian, ending in the limit as a complete graph 3-simplex Coxeter-Dynkin diagram with 6 infinite order branches, which can be expressed as 3,3. Rank 5-11 have {{a finite number of}} groups 186, 66, 36, 13, 10, 8, and 4 Lorentzian groups respectively. A 2013 paper by H. Chen and J.-P. Labbé, Lorentzian Coxeter groups and Boyd--Maxwell ball packings, recomputed and published the complete list.|$|E

He mentions insects for some examples unique to them, as the antennae, elytra (scaly wing-cases), ovipositors (<b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>them</b> 'awls') for laying eggs deep in plants or wood, stings, the proboscis of bees, the light-producing organ of the glow-worm and so on.|$|E
500|$|As {{characters}} {{from the previous}} chapters of the game gather around to congratulate him, Conker realizes {{that he should have}} brought Berri back to life when he was negotiating with programmers. <b>He</b> <b>calls</b> <b>them</b> out to bring her back to life, only to realize that they have left already. Conker then gives a closing monologue, in which he discusses appreciating what one already has instead of always wanting more, stating that [...] "the grass is always greener, and you don't really know what it is you have until it's gone." [...] The credits roll, and afterwards Conker is seen back at the same pub he was seen in {{at the start of the}} game, drowning his sorrows in Scotch whisky. He drunkenly exits the bar as it begins to storm outside, and leaves in the direction opposite the one he took previously.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{claim of}} inventing {{the hot dog}} is told by Harry M. Stevens, an American sports {{concessionaire}} whose vendors sold German sausages and rolls to spectators at the old New York Polo Grounds during the winter. <b>He</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> [...] "Dachshund sandwiches", but a New York Post cartoonist [...] "couldn't spell dachshund, so when he drew the cartoon, <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> hot dogs." ...|$|R

500|$|Francis Aaron (Ralph Brown), nicknamed [...] "Eighty-Five" [...] for his IQ, is Andrews' {{assistant}} and a prison guard. After Andrews' death, Aaron {{tries to take}} charge but the prisoners refute his authority. Ripley tells him several times that the Weyland-Yutani company does not care about him or any other employee, and {{are more interested in}} acquiring the Aliens. Aaron refuses to send the rescue ship away because he wants to see his family again. He helps Ripley with the bio-scan she performs on herself on the crashed spacecraft, and they discover that she has been impregnated with an Alien chestburster. Weyland-Yutani immediately informs the prison that a rescue ship will arrive in several hours to pick her up, and Aaron concludes that the corporation only wants the Aliens. When the prisoners decide to lure the alien into the molten lead, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>them</b> crazy and locks himself in his office. Michael Bishop lands with his team and tries to convince Ripley to leave with him; Aaron hits him with a large metal rod, nearly ripping his ear off, and is shot dead by Bishop's team.|$|E

The Doctor, using his Sonic Screwdriver as a torch, reveals several aliens who are all blasted by Rose's ray gun. The Doctor then turns on the light and sees that they have materialised at a child dress-up party. The child then comes in. The Doctor and Rose wish him a happy birthday. <b>He</b> <b>calls</b> <b>them</b> to get a doctor. [...] "Funny you should say that" [...] says the Doctor.|$|E

2500|$|Weber {{points out}} that such a spirit {{is not limited to}} Western culture if one {{considers}} it as the attitude of individuals, but that such individuals – heroic entrepreneurs, as <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>them</b> – could not by themselves establish a new economic order (capitalism). He further noted that the spirit of capitalism could be divorced from religion, and that those passionate capitalists of his era were either passionate against the Church or at least indifferent to it. Desire for profit with minimum effort and seeing work as a burden to be avoided, and doing no more than what was enough for modest life, were common attitudes. As he wrote in his essays: ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{individuals}} {{want to be}} {{teachers of}} mankind but Kierkegaard has emphasized the teachers that accompany man {{from one generation to}} another. He wrote of Abraham, Job, The Apostle Paul, and Anna and Simeon as teachers of mankind in his Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses and Johann Goethe and Friedrich Hegel as teachers of aesthetics and ethics. But he's writing about the earnest confession before God, marriage, and death as teachers of another kind that accompanies mankind from generation to generation. Later he uses the [...] "lily of the field and the bird of the air" [...] to teach {{what it means to be}} a human being where <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>them</b> the [...] "divinely appointed teachers".|$|E
2500|$|He {{intends to}} use {{archaeology}} and geology to [...] "draw aside the veil" [...] covering the situations {{of the peoples}} mentioned in proto-historic documents, such as Caesar's Commentaries and the Agricola of Tacitus. Adopting Lyell's scheme of the Tertiary, he divides Pleistocene into Early, Mid- and Late. Only the Palaeolithic falls into the Pleistocene; the Neolithic is in the [...] "Prehistoric Period" [...] subsequent. Dawkins defines {{what was to become}} the Upper, Middle and Lower Paleolithic, except that <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>them</b> the [...] "Upper Cave-Earth and Breccia," [...] the [...] "Middle Cave-Earth," [...] and the [...] "Lower Red Sand," [...] with reference to the names of the layers.

2500|$|Historian David Henige {{has argued}} that many {{population}} figures {{are the result of}} arbitrary formulas selectively applied to numbers from unreliable historical sources. He believes this is a weakness unrecognized by several contributors to the field, and insists there is not sufficient evidence to produce population numbers that have any real meaning. He characterizes the modern trend of high estimates as [...] "pseudo-scientific number-crunching." [...] Henige does not advocate a low population estimate, but argues that the scanty and unreliable nature of the evidence renders broad estimates inevitably suspect, saying [...] "high counters" [...] (as <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>them)</b> have been particularly flagrant in their misuse of sources. [...] Many population studies acknowledge the inherent difficulties in producing reliable statistics, given the scarcity of hard data.|$|E
2500|$|But, {{in direct}} contradiction to the French tradition, Donizetti found himself having {{to employ the}} [...] "old-fashioned Italian {{convention}} of the musico", the female singer trouser role which musicologist William Ashbrook states was defined by the composer to mean [...] "a male-hero role intended to be sung by a female contralto". When contacts with a favourite tenor with local audiences in Naples, Giovanni Basadonna, were fruitless and when the composer did not consider any of three available primo tenors {{good enough for the}} part("almost useless", <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>them),</b> he created a trouser role in the Rossinian tradition of Tancredi (from the opera Tancredi) or Arsace (in Semiramide). Therefore, the leading male role of Aurelio [...] in L'assedio, while written for a contralto, is most often performed by a mezzo-soprano.|$|E
2500|$|Though neither Legolas's age nor his birthdate are {{directly}} given in Tolkien's writings, some passages {{indicate that he}} is far older than Aragorn and Gimli. For instance, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>them</b> [...] "children" [...] and says he has seen [...] "many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age". The Appendices to The Lord of the Rings do give Gimli's and Aragorn's birthdates: {{at the time of}} the War of the Ring, they are 139 and 87 respectively. [...] Though his father and his kingdom appear in The Hobbit, Legolas does not appear himself, as his character had not yet been created. Being older than Gimli, he must have been alive during the events of The Hobbit, which take place less than a century before the Quest of Mount Doom.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Tyzik (McKinney) is {{a lonely}} man who despises {{virtually}} everyone, especially those he considers businessmen and trendy people. <b>He</b> <b>calls</b> <b>them</b> [...] "flatheads" [...] because in his mind, their heads {{deserve to be}} crushed. He is {{more than willing to}} help by pretending to crush their heads from a distance with his fingers, using forced perspective, while enthusiastically declaring [...] "I'm crushing your head! I'm crushing your head!" [...] in a high-pitched nasal voice with a slight eastern European accent, followed by making a crushing noise. [...] In his own words: [...] "Not everyone deserves to have their head crushed, just 99.99999% of them." [...] It is suggested that the headcrushing is not necessarily all in his head, in one sketch, where he is able to quickly determine that the heads of two people passing by have already been crushed by a [...] "facepincher", with whom he proceeds to have a duel.|$|E
2500|$|Machiavelli {{explains}} {{repeatedly that}} religion is man-made, and {{that the value of}} religion lies in its contribution to social order and the rules of morality must be dispensed with if security requires it. In The Prince, the Discourses, and in the Life of Castruccio Castracani, he describes [...] "prophets", as <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>them,</b> like Moses, Romulus, Cyrus the Great, and Theseus (he treated pagan and Christian patriarchs in the same way) as the greatest of new princes, the glorious and brutal founders of the most novel innovations in politics, and men whom Machiavelli assures us have always used a large amount of armed force and murder against their own people. He estimated that these sects last from 1,666 to 3,000 years each time, which, as pointed out by Leo Strauss, would mean that Christianity became due to start finishing about 150 years after Machiavelli. Machiavelli's concern with Christianity as a sect was that it makes men weak and inactive, delivering politics into the hands of cruel and wicked men without a fight.|$|E
2500|$|In a U.S. Naval {{expedition}} report, {{figures are}} given of two stars in bronze (found at Cuzco, Peru), one having a sixth ray prolonged into a hatchet, {{which suggests that}} {{it must have been a}} war-club or battle-axe. In Squire's book on Peru, there is a figure of a six-rayed object in bronze, said to have been one of several, which are designated by the author (apparently following some earlier writer) casse-têtes, and he says that among the fractured skulls that were found [...] "the larger part seemed to have been broken by blows from some such weapons". Mons. Wiener, in his book on Peru and Bolivia gives a figure of a star and was found at Ancon (archaeological site) near Lima showing a stick inserted in the central hole; and another figure of a somewhat similar from in bronze, also handled. Like Squier, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>them</b> casse-têtes. Finally, the Doctors Reiss and Stübel remark, in their work upon the Peruvian antiquities obtained at Ancon, that [...] "the few stone objects found here show but slight traces of workmanship, an exception being ... a stone weapon of the morning star type ... the six-rayed stone star, here found once only, is elsewhere in Peruvian graves by no means rare." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the outset}} he begins with I-objects and II-objects, two objects A and B that are I-objects (first axiom), and {{two types of}} [...] "operations" [...] that assume {{ordering}} as a structural property obtained of the resulting objects [...] and (x, y). The two [...] "domains of objects" [...] are called [...] "arguments" [...] (I-objects) and [...] "functions" [...] (II-objects); where they overlap are the [...] "argument functions" [...] (<b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>them</b> I-II objects). He introduces two [...] "universal two-variable operations" [...] – (i) the operation : [...] "[...] [...] read 'the value of the function x for the argument y [...] [...] [...] it itself is a type I object", and (ii) the operation (x, y): [...] "[...] [...] (read 'the ordered pair x, y') whose variables x and y must both be arguments and that itself produces an argument (x, y). Its most important property is that x1 = x2 and y1 = y2 follow from (x1 = y2) = (x2 = y2)". To clarify the function pair he notes that [...] "Instead of f(x) we write [...] to indicate that f, just like x, is {{to be regarded as}} a variable in this procedure". To avoid the [...] "antinomies of naive set theory, in Russell's first of all [...] [...] [...] we must forgo treating certain functions as arguments". He adopts a notion from Zermelo to restrict these [...] "certain functions".|$|E
