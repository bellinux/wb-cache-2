Our young people fall in love and marry. The joy of birth comes to our mothers, and the tragedy of death looms over us all. Some go out into the world, some choose to remain here.

60|$|The {{argument}} used is {{of course}} plain enough. It is said that women are left destitute in the world--destitute unless they can be self- dependent, and that to women {{should be given the}} same open access to wages that men possess, in order that they may be as self- dependent as men. Why should a young woman, for whom no father is able to provide, not enjoy those means of provision which are open to a young man so circumstanced? But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> is very simple. The young man, under the happiest circumstances which may befall him, is bound to earn his bread. The young woman is only so bound when happy circumstances do not befall her. Should we endeavor to make the recurrence of unhappy circumstances more general or less so? What does any tradesman, any professional man, any mechanic wish for his children? Is it not this, that his sons shall go forth and earn their bread, and that his daughters shall remain with him till they are married? Is not that the mother's wish? Is it not notorious that such is the wish of us all as to our daughters? In advocating the rights of women it is of other men's girls that we think, never of our own.|$|E
60|$|As natural {{selection}} acts {{only by the}} accumulation of slight modifications of structure or instinct, each profitable to the individual under its conditions of life, it may reasonably be asked, how a long and graduated succession of modified architectural instincts, all tending towards the present perfect plan of construction, could have profited the progenitors of the hive-bee? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> is not difficult: {{it is known that}} bees are often hard pressed to get sufficient nectar; and I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier that it has been experimentally found that no less than from twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar are consumed by a hive of bees for the secretion of each pound of wax; so that a prodigious quantity of fluid nectar must be collected and consumed by the bees in a hive for the secretion of the wax necessary for the construction of their combs. Moreover, many bees have to remain idle for many days during the process of secretion. A large store of honey is indispensable to support a large stock of bees during the winter; and the security of the hive is known mainly to depend on a large number of bees being supported. Hence the saving of wax by largely saving honey must be a most important element of success in any family of bees. Of course the success of any species of bee may be dependent on the number of its parasites or other enemies, or on quite distinct causes, and so be altogether independent of the quantity of honey which the bees could collect. But let us suppose that this latter circumstance determined, as it probably often does determine, the numbers of a humble-bee which could exist in a country; and let us further suppose that the community lived throughout the winter, and consequently required a store of honey: there can in this case be no doubt that it would be an advantage to our humble-bee, if a slight modification of her instinct led her to make her waxen cells near together, so as to intersect a little; for a wall in common even to two adjoining cells, would save some little wax. Hence it would continually be more and more advantageous to our humble-bee, if she were to make her cells more and more regular, nearer together, and aggregated into a mass, like the cells of the Melipona; for in this case {{a large part of the}} bounding surface of each cell would serve to bound other cells, and much wax would be saved. Again, from the same cause, it would be advantageous to the Melipona, if she were to make her cells closer together, and more regular in every way than at present; for then, as we have seen, the spherical surfaces would wholly disappear, and would all be replaced by plane surfaces; and the Melipona would make a comb as perfect as that of the hive-bee. Beyond this stage of perfection in architecture, {{natural selection}} could not lead; for the comb of the hive-bee, as far as we can see, is absolutely perfect in economising wax.|$|E

40|$|McGrath (2005 /this issue) has {{published}} a very significant article; it is significant because it ex-amines the substantive issue of construct validity in a simple and informative way, noting the confusions apparent in how constructs and their variables are defined, used, and interpreted within the domain of personality and individual differences. This is a careful, thoughtful, article that quietly proceeds to outline the problems with current thinking and approaches to defining and using constructs in psychology. McGrath also suggests how {{some of these problems}} might be addressed. I note that McGrath appears to miss what might be considered an obvious rejoin-der to some of his arguments, that is, the use of latent variable and item response theory. Some consideration is given to these arguments. However, a cursory examination shows that although these new methodologies offer many opportunities for new stochastic questionnaire data mod-eling and the construction of “instant ” latent variables, the same problems caused by lack of at-tention to measurement and meaning remain. I find I am in agreement with many of the author’s views and arguments, but I also find myself wondering whether modern psychometrics and in-dividual differences research methods is now so dominated by psychological statisticians that any thought of substantive scientific innovation in this area that deals more properly with mea-surement and meaning is long gone. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to <b>the</b> question “What if there was no psychometrics? ” would be most illuminating. In “Conceptual Complexity and Construct Validity,” McGrath (2005 /this issue) provides some much needed ex-ploration of processes by which psychologists define and as-sess constructs and the variables that are said to be constitu-tive of them. There are, for me, some very significant observations and statements made by McGrath throughout the article that I address in more detail...|$|R

After Coen became the Governor-General, he initially tried to expel all of Asian traders from the Maluku Islands, but, as this policy turned out to be impractical, he chose to leave the Chinese as “regulated arbitrageurs” to replace other “unregulated arbitrageurs” in order to maintain his strange monopoly policy...|$|E

This hypothesis can be tested (and further refined) with experiments using awake behaving monkeys and human subjects, doing electrophysiological recordings and electrical and pharmacological manipulations, as well as brain imaging (fMRI / EEG) experiments.
