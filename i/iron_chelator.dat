25|$|Iron {{overload}} is {{an unavoidable}} consequence of chronic transfusion therapy, necessary {{for patients with}} beta thalassemia. Iron chelation is a medical therapy that avoids the complications of iron overload. The iron overload can be removed by Deferasirox, an oral <b>iron</b> <b>chelator,</b> which has a dose- dependent effect on iron burden. Every unit of transfused blood contains 200–250mg of iron and the body has no natural mechanism to remove excess iron Deferasirox is a vital part in the patients health after blood transfusions. During normal iron homeostasis the circulating iron is bound to transferrin, but with an iron overload, the ability for transferrin to bind iron is exceeded and non-transferrin bound iron is formed. It represents a potentially toxic iron form due to its high propensity to induce oxygen species and is responsible for cellular damage. The prevention of iron overload protects patients from morbidity and mortality. The primary aim is to bind to and remove iron from the body and a rate equal to the rate of transfusional iron input or greater than iron input. During clinical trails patients that received Deferasirox experienced no drug-related neutropenia or agranulocytosis, which was present with other iron chelators. Its long half life requires it to be taken once daily and provides constant chelation. Cardiac failure is a main cause of illness from transfusional iron overload but deferasirox demonstrated the ability to remove iron from iron-loaded myocardial cells protecting beta thalassemia patients from effects of required blood transfusions.|$|E

Alleviation of the most common symptom, hearing loss, has been varyingly successful through the use of cochlear implants.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this thesis is to synthesise novel thiosemicarbazone based <b>iron</b> <b>chelators</b> and investigate their anti-proliferative activity against neoplastic cells. Traditionally, <b>iron</b> <b>chelators</b> were developed {{for the treatment of}} iron overload diseases. However, the increased requirement for iron in rapidly proliferating cells, compared with normal cells, create an opportunity to use iron as a novel target for cancer chemotherapy. Previous development of thiosemicarbazone based <b>iron</b> <b>chelators</b> created new <b>iron</b> <b>chelators</b> with potent and selective anti-tumour activity towards a wide variety of human and murine tumour xenografts such as 2 -benzoylpyridine thisoemicarbazone (BpT) and 2 -(3 '-nitrobenzoyl) pyridine thiosemicarbazone (NBpT). In order to understand the structure-activity relationship of the thiosemicarbazone scaffold, novel BpT analogues were designed. First attempt was made by incorporating methyl substitution on the pyridine ring and mono- or di- methoxy substitutions at the phenyl ring. In addition, incorporation of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents at the phenyl substituents of the N 4 -position of the BpT scaffold was done. Subsequently, dimerisation of BpT by forming dithiosemicarbazones using 2, 6 -dibenzoylpyridine were also investigated. Most of the novel thiosemicarbazone based <b>iron</b> <b>chelators</b> showed significantly higher anti-proliferative activity than the commercially available, gold-standard chelator desferrioxamine. Structure-activity relationship study revealed that the chelators with a single methyl substitutent on the pyridine ring had the highest anti-proliferative activity. Incorporation of mono- or di- substitution at the phenyl ring resulted in lower anti-proliferation activity, while methoxy substitution at the phenyl ring enhanced iron chelation efficacy. The study also indicated that benzoylpyridine thisoemicarbazones with electron-donating substituents resulted in greater anti-proliferative activity than electron-withdrawing groups. The increased molecular weight of the chelators influences the lipophilicity of the ligands resulting in low or moderate potency of the chelators towards neoplastic cells.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} either iron salts or <b>iron</b> <b>chelators</b> on the {{biosynthesis}} of transferrin receptors in human erythroleukemic lines was investigated. Addition of these compounds induced a rapid and marked decrease (iron salts) or increase (<b>iron</b> <b>chelators)</b> {{in the level}} of transferrin receptors synthesis. Both phenomena were inhibited by actinomycin D. In contrast, the increase in the synthesis of ferritin induced in these cells by addition of iron salts was not inhibited by actinomycin D. These results suggest that iron salts modulate the synthesis of transferrin receptors and ferritin via different molecular mechanisms, of transcriptional and translation type, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{suggesting}} that iron and calcium are interrelated in oxidant-induced DNA damage. The effect of <b>iron</b> <b>chelators</b> and agents that buffer cytosolic-free calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) on hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA strand breaks in LLC-PK 1 cells {{has not been}} previously examined. In addition, the interrelationship between iron and calcium in the pathogenesis of DNA damage has not been studied in any model of tissue injury. Exposure of LLC-PK 1 cells to 1 mM hydrogen peroxide resulted in marked DNA damage, {{as measured by the}} alkaline unwinding assay (residual intact double stranded DNA at 10 min, control: 88 ± 1 %; hydrogen peroxide-treated cells: 17 ± 3 %, N = 8). The <b>iron</b> <b>chelators,</b> 1, 10 -phenanthroline and deferoxamine, and agents which buffer [Ca 2 +]i], BAPTA and quin- 2, provided highly significant protection against hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA strand breaks. We then examined the effect of <b>iron</b> <b>chelators</b> on hydrogen peroxide-induced rise in [Ca 2 +]i] in LLC-PK 1 cells. Both 1, 10 -phenanthroline and deferoxamine prevented the marked and sustained rise in [Ca 2 +]i] induced by exposure of LLC-PK 1 cells to 1 mM hydrogen peroxide ([Ca 2 +]i] at 15 min, control 100 ± 3 nM; hydrogen peroxide 195 ± 14 nM; 1, 10 -phenanthroline + hydrogen peroxide 100 ± 4 nM; deferoxamine + hydrogen peroxide 106 ± 4 nM; N = 4). We excluded the possibility that the <b>iron</b> <b>chelators</b> were directly chelating calcium by performing experiments using a cell free system. We also confirmed that BAPTA and quin- 2, in concentrations used in our study, chelate calcium but not iron or copper. Our data thus indicate a role for both iron and calcium in hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA strand breaks, and suggest that the effect of <b>iron</b> <b>chelators</b> in preventing DNA damage may be related at least in part to their ability to prevent oxidant-induced rise in [Ca 2 +]i]...|$|R
40|$|Organ {{shortage}} {{leads to}} an increased utilization of marginal organs which are particularly sensitive to storage-associated damage. Cold incubation and rewarming-induced injury is iron-dependent in many cell types. In addition, a chloride-dependent component of injury has been described. This work examines the injury induced by cold incubation and rewarming in isolated rat renal proximal tubules. The tissue storage solution TiProtec® and a chloride-poor modification, each with and without <b>iron</b> <b>chelators,</b> were used for cold incubation. Incubation was performed 4 °C for up to 168 h, followed by rewarming in an extracellular buffer (3 h at 37 °C). After 48, 120 and 168 h of cold incubation LDH release was lower in solutions containing <b>iron</b> <b>chelators.</b> After rewarming, injury increased especially after cold incubation in chelator-free solutions. Without addition of <b>iron</b> <b>chelators</b> LDH release showed {{a tendency to be}} higher in chloride-poor solutions. Following rewarming after 48 h of cold incubation lipid peroxidation was significantly decreased and metabolic activity was tendentially better in tubules incubated with <b>iron</b> <b>chelators.</b> Morphological alterations included mitochondrial swelling and fragmentation being partially reversible during rewarming. ATP content was better preserved in chloride-rich solutions. During rewarming, there was a further decline of ATP content in the so far best conditions and minor alterations under the other conditions, while oxygen consumption was not significantly different compared to non-stored control tubules. Results show an iron-dependent component of preservation injury during cold incubation and rewarming in rat proximal renal tubules and reveal a benefit of chloride for the maintenance of tubular energy state during cold incubation...|$|R
