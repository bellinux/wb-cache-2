5000|$|Chainsaws {{have almost}} entirely {{replaced}} simple man-powered saws in forestry. They come in many sizes, from small <b>electric</b> <b>saws</b> intended for home and garden use, to large [...] "lumberjack" [...] saws.

5000|$|Kickback is {{primarily}} caused by cutting with the chain in the [...] "kickback zone" [...] on the bar, the upper {{quarter of the}} nose. Some <b>saws,</b> usually <b>electric</b> <b>saws</b> intended for domestic garden use, shield this whole area from contact with a [...] "tip protector". All cutting produces a reaction force on the saw: normally this should be the lower edge of the bar, where the chain is travelling towards the saw and the reaction tends to pull the saw safely towards the log, against the spur dogs. Where the chain is moving downwards, as {{at the tip of}} the bar, the same reaction force now acts upwards and will cause a kickback upwards.|$|R

5000|$|Kehoe-era M.I.R.V. shows often {{featured}} songs {{punctuated by}} interludes of lunacy, usually featuring a verbal interchange between Haggard and Kehoe. Often Haggard would announce a contest {{for the women}} in the audience, after which the winner would be cajoled into grabbing Kehoe's groin, causing him to sing in a high-pitched operatic voice. Kehoe would often sing the Neapolitan standard [...] "'O Sole Mio" [...] following the antics. M.I.R.V. shows would regularly feature Haggard playing an <b>electric</b> <b>saw</b> during portions of the concerts.|$|E
50|$|The {{body was}} cut into 20-centimeter pieces using an <b>electric</b> <b>saw,</b> and the muscle was {{carefully}} cut away. After this, {{the body was}} carefully washed and drained of all its blood; this would require the skills of a highly trained medical doctor. The body was not battered {{and there were no}} traces of drugs, so the cause of death could not be determined. There were slight traces of internal bleeding in the muscle, indicating that the man may have been cut while still alive.|$|E
5|$|The {{quarries}} and mines made {{increasing use of}} mechanization {{from the}} start of the 20th century, with electricity replacing steam and water as a power source. The Llechwedd Quarry introduced its first electrical plant in 1891, and in 1906, a hydro-electric plant was opened in Cwm Dyli, on the lower slopes of Snowdon, which supplied electricity to the largest quarries in the area. The use of <b>electric</b> <b>saws</b> and other machinery reduced the hard manual labour involved in extracting the slate, but produced much more slate dust than the old manual methods, leading to an increased incidence of silicosis. The work was also dangerous in other ways, with the blasting operations responsible for many deaths. A government enquiry in 1893 found that the death rate for underground workers in the slate mines was 3.23 per thousand, higher than the rate for coal miners.|$|R
5000|$|Mitre saw [...] - [...] often {{referred}} to as a large backsaw (20-30 inches or 60-90 cm) used either in a wooden or metal mitre box or in a metal frame which allowed cutting mitres of any specified angle. Note that not all mitre saws are backsaws, and the <b>electric</b> mitre <b>saw</b> (or chop saw) has largely taken its place today.|$|R
40|$|Voltage {{fluctuation}} {{is depicted}} as a sequence of {{root mean square voltage}} changes or a cyclic difference of the voltage waveform envelopeThe non-resistive loads used in the power system are the major source of fluctuation. Such fluctuating loads include arc furnaces, rolling mill drives, and main winder. All of these have loads with a high rate of change of power with respect to the short-circuit capacity at the point of common coupling (PCC). Small power loads also can be sources of flicker, such as starting of induction motors, welders, boilers, power regulators, <b>electric</b> <b>saws</b> and hammers, pumps and compressors, cranes, and elevators. In power systems, a number of harmful technical problems occur due to voltage fluctuation, resulting in disturbance to production processes and considerable costs. But flicker has its negative physiological results, which can affect worker safety as well as productivity. This paper represent various wavelets used for monitoring of Fluctuation and Flicker...|$|R
50|$|Sanford {{was born}} and raised in Winnetka, Illinois, an upscale suburb of Chicago. She is the second of five {{children}} born to an Irish Catholic family. Sanford's family was prominent in the area. Her great-grandfather, Joseph W. Sullivan, co-founded Skil Corporation, which manufactured the first portable <b>electric</b> <b>saw.</b> Her uncle and another grandfather, both lawyers, headed the Winston and Strawn law firm. Sanford also is the niece of Anne Reynolds Skakel, who was the wife Rushton Skakel, who in turn is the brother of Ethel Kennedy.|$|E
50|$|House {{brings the}} <b>electric</b> <b>saw</b> and a scalpel to the scene, and {{explains}} that he cannot give her anesthesia, since it is too risky, forcing him to amputate the leg with her awake, followed by her screams. She is immediately taken to an ambulance, which then departs for Princeton-Plainsboro. On the ride back, House continues the differential on the crane operator through the phone and deduces {{that he has a}} spinal cyst. Hanna suddenly has trouble breathing. House realizes she has a fat embolism, caused by the amputation.|$|E
50|$|In June 2006, Réal Vallée, a local {{fisherman}} {{engaged in}} snow crab and whelk fishing aboard the catamaran Realice, had strung {{a series of}} cages on the river bottom, secured at both ends by small anchors attached to buoys. One of these anchors got snagged onto the cable. The anchor with the cable attached was hauled out of the water, and Vallée freed it by cutting the cable with an <b>electric</b> <b>saw.</b> Several days later, {{the same thing happened}} and he cut the cable again. He had done so, believing that the cable had been abandoned (according to a handwritten note on a map he had seen at a local museum). Remote monitoring controls operated by Telus indicated that the Sunoque I parted about 8.9 km off Baie-Comeau.|$|E

50|$|After a New Orleans {{newspaper}} ran {{an article}} about Michel's invention, he was approached by Joseph W. Sullivan. The two became business partners and moved to Chicago. In 1924, they were granted a patent for the Michel <b>Electric</b> Hand <b>Saw.</b> Attracting immediate interest from contractors despite numerous mechanical problems, the two began production of the saw. The name was changed to Skil in 1926, after Sullivan's wife commented on the skill necessary to use one.|$|R
50|$|Fertel {{personally}} took a hand {{in every}} part of the business. She had to teach herself how to butcher steak, and despite being just five-foot-two and 110-pounds, would saw up 30-pound short loins by hand until she could afford an <b>electric</b> band <b>saw.</b> She staffed her restaurant with single mothers, saying that they were hard workers and reliable. For many years, Chris' Steak House was the only upscale restaurant in New Orleans with an all-female wait staff.|$|R
