25|$|Output neglect {{includes}} {{motor and}} pre-motor deficits. A patient with motor neglect {{does not use}} a contralesional limb despite the neuromuscular ability to do so. One with pre-motor neglect, or directional <b>hypokinesia,</b> can move unaffected limbs ably in ipsilateral space but have difficulty directing them into contralesional space. Thus a patient with pre-motor neglect may struggle to grasp an object {{on the left side}} even when using the unaffected right arm.|$|E
25|$|Regular {{physical}} exercise {{with or without}} physiotherapy can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility, flexibility, strength, gait speed, and quality of life. In terms of improving flexibility and range of motion for patients experiencing rigidity, generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking {{have been found to}} decrease excessive muscle tension. Other effective techniques to promote relaxation include slow rotational movements of the extremities and trunk, rhythmic initiation, diaphragmatic breathing, and meditation techniques. Common changes in gait associated with the disease such as <b>hypokinesia</b> (slowness of movement), shuffling and decreased arm swing are addressed by a variety of strategies to improve functional mobility and safety. Goals with respect to gait during rehabilitation programs include improving gait speed, base of support, stride length, trunk and arm swing movement. Strategies include utilizing assistive equipment (pole walking and treadmill walking), verbal cueing (manual, visual and auditory), exercises (marching and PNF patterns) and varying environments (surfaces, inputs, open vs. closed).|$|E

40|$|Movement {{abnormalities}} can be dichotomised {{into the}} two broad categories of hypokinetic and hyperkinetic syndromes. The hallmark of <b>hypokinesias</b> {{is the loss}} of voluntary and automatic movements (akinesia), which is combined with slowness (bradykinesia) and stiffness or increased muscle tone (rigidity) in akinetic-rigid or parkinsonian syndromes (1). In contrast, hyperkinesias are manifested by abnormal, uncontrollable and unwanted movements. This term {{should not be confused with}} “hyperkinetic disorders” used in ICD- 10 (2) to describe a behavioural abnormality, typically labelled attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity, occurring particularly in children and often associated with attention deficit and a tendency to move from one activity to another without completing any one. This is often associated with disorganized, ill-regulated, and scattered activity and thinking. This is not the only inconsistency between terminology in adult and childhood disorders, and efforts have been recently undertaken to unify the nosology and diagnostic recommendations in pediatric and adult movement disorders (3) ...|$|R
40|$|Restless legs is {{a medical}} {{disorder}} and can be treated Movement disorders have long been an interest of the Editor of Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment (Brimblecombe and Pinder 1972). Movement disorders can manifest as slowness or poverty of movement (<b>hypokinesias)</b> or as abnormal involuntary movements (hyperkinesias). Two of the commonest hyperkinesias are essential tremor, which has been described in a previous {{issue of the journal}} (Uccellini et al 2006), and restless legs syndrome (RLS), which occupies much of the current issue and was also reviewed in a recent issue (Byrne et al 2006). RLS is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the limbs accompanied by uncomfortable sensations, leading to disturbed sleep and a poor quality of life. Symptoms usually begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, and are partly or completely relieved by active movement. Symptoms tend to worsen in the evening and at night. Not all cases where legs are restless are due to RLS, and it can be distinguished from nocturnal leg cramps, positional discomfort, and akathisia. However, almost all RLS patients also experience periodi...|$|R
500|$|A {{particular}} {{conceptual model}} of the motor circuit and its alteration with PD has been of great influence since 1980, although some limitations have been pointed out which have led to modifications. In this model, the basal ganglia normally exert a constant inhibitory influence {{on a wide range}} of motor systems, preventing them from becoming active at inappropriate times. When a decision is made to perform a particular action, inhibition is reduced for the required motor system, thereby releasing it for activation. Dopamine acts to facilitate this release of inhibition, so high levels of dopamine function tend to promote motor activity, while low levels of dopamine function, such as occur in PD, demand greater exertions of effort for any given movement. Thus, the net effect of dopamine depletion is to produce <b>hypokinesia,</b> an overall reduction in motor output. [...] Drugs that are used to treat PD, conversely, may produce excessive dopamine activity, allowing motor systems to be activated at inappropriate times and thereby producing dyskinesias.|$|E
500|$|Exercise {{programs}} are recommended {{in people with}} Parkinson's disease. There {{is some evidence that}} speech or mobility problems can improve with rehabilitation, although studies are scarce and of low quality. Regular physical exercise with or without physical therapy can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility, flexibility, strength, gait speed, and quality of life. When an exercise program is performed under the supervision of a physiotherapist, there are more improvements in motor symptoms, mental and emotional functions, daily living activities, and quality of life compared to a self-supervised exercise program at home. In terms of improving flexibility and range of motion for people experiencing rigidity, generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking have been found to decrease excessive muscle tension. Other effective techniques to promote relaxation include slow rotational movements of the extremities and trunk, rhythmic initiation, diaphragmatic breathing, and meditation techniques. As for gait and addressing the challenges associated with the disease such as <b>hypokinesia</b> (slowness of movement), shuffling and decreased arm swing; physiotherapists have a variety of strategies to improve functional mobility and safety. Areas of interest with respect to gait during rehabilitation programs focus on, {{but are not limited to}} improving gait speed, the base of support, stride length, trunk and arm swing movement. Strategies include utilizing assistive equipment (pole walking and treadmill walking), verbal cueing (manual, visual and auditory), exercises (marching and PNF patterns) and altering environments (surfaces, inputs, open vs. closed). Strengthening exercises have shown improvements in strength and motor function for people with primary muscular weakness and weakness related to inactivity with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease. However, reports show a significant interaction between strength and the time the medications was taken. Therefore, it is recommended that people with PD should perform exercises 45 minutes to one hour after medications when they are at their best. Also, due to the forward flexed posture, and respiratory dysfunctions in advanced Parkinson's disease, [...] deep diaphragmatic breathing exercises are beneficial in improving chest wall mobility and vital capacity. Exercise may improve constipation.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, a few hyperkinesias such as Huntington’s chorea, post-hemiplegic choreoathetosis, Tourette’s syndrome, and {{some forms of}} both tremor and {{dystonia}} were described in a clinical orientation. [...] However, the common pathology was still a mystery. [...] British neurologist William Richard Gowers called these disorders “general and functional diseases of the nervous system” in his 1888 publication entitled A Manual of Diseases of the Nervous System. It {{was not until the}} late 1980s and 1990s that sufficient animal models and human clinical trials were utilized to discover the specific involvement of the basal ganglia in the hyperkinesia pathology. In 1998, Wichmann and Delong made the conclusion that hyperkinesia is associated with decreased output from the basal ganglia, and in contrast, <b>hypokinesia</b> is associated with increased output from the basal ganglia. This generalization, however, still leaves a need for more complex models to distinguish the more nuanced pathologies of the numerous diverse hyperkinesias which are still being studied today.|$|E

40|$|Borna-Disease-Virus (BDV) is a {{single-stranded}} RNA virus with neurotropism, causing persistent {{infection of}} {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) in mammals. This leads to different neurological sign like blindness, learning or movement disorders, memory disturbances, paralysis, <b>hypokinesias,</b> anorexia, excitations, colic and salivation, psychiatric disorders, dementia and behavioral abnormalities, which can all be attributed to diseases of the limbic system. Borna-virus-infections have been described {{in a wide range of}} species. By now, nearly all animal species can be infected experimentally (Stitz et al. 1981; Ludwig et al. 1988; Rott und Becht 1995). The clinical signs of Borna-disease are not caused by the virus itself, but rather by the host`s immune response. Transmission of BDV probably occurs via upper airway mucosa, the pharynx or olfactory mucosa. Regarding a virus reservoir, an infection of small rodents cannot be ruled out and the bicolored white-toothed shrew (Crocidura leucodon) has been discussed as natural reservoir host (Kersten 2015). Concerning the virus transmission to humans no consentaneous statement could be made until 2015, when representatives of the Borna-virus family named „Variegated Squirrel Borna Virus 1 “ (VSBV- 1), found in variegated squirrels (Sciurus variegatoides) were able to infect humans (Hoffmann 2015). Local BDV strains differ in their protein pattern. Based on the N-protein gene it was proven, that viruses isolated from horses of outbreaks in different locations had a much higher genetic variability of the N-protein gene with increasing spatial separation. This supports the hypothesis that infections amongst susceptible species are maintained by enzootic, geographically differentiates virus strains. The virus is able to rapidly adapt to other species (Dietz 2006). The BDV can be found in the human genome and replicates in affected nuclei, but so far the significance of the detection of BDV in human DNA remains unclear (Tomonaga 2002). Post mortem diagnostic tests are indisputable, but the intra vitam diagnosis raises difficulties and permits not prognostic statement in clinically healthy horses. Diagnostic test necessitate a high sensitivity as only a low antibody titer is generated by a BDV infection, which results in a low specificity of the test (Staeheli et al. 2000). Avian borna viruses (ABV), which are linked to diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system of psittacides (Hankavuori et al. 2008; Kistler et al. 2008), produce neurological signs like epileptic episodes, ataxia, paresis, tremor and head tilt. Meanwhile they are regarded as causative agent of the neuropathic proventricular dilatation disease (PDD) (Gancz et al. 2010; Hoppes et al. 2010; Payne et al. 2011). Contrast enhanced radiography proving PDD is not sufficient for a definite diagnosis (Degernes et al. 1996). So far PCRs (Hankavuori et al. 2008; Kistler et al. 2008; Weissenböck et al. 2009 b), Western blot (Villanueva et al. 2010), ELISA (De Kloet und Dorrestein 2009) and immunofluorescent testing do not provide a reliable diagnostic test, for which reason a combination of serological tests and PCR is recommended (Herzog et al. 2010). Diseases animals are treated symptomatically. It is assumed that ABV is transmitted via a faecal-oral route (De Kloet und Dorrestein 2009), because the virus colonizes the entire gastrointestinal tract. However, BDV has not been found in faeces of mammals yet (Sauder und Staeheli 2003), only in faeces of birds (Malkinson et al. 1995). The transmission of VSBV- 1 remains uncertain, but a droplet infection is suspected. For detection of VSBV- 1 virus analogue analyses, molecular biological detection methods, serological tests with IFT and ELISA as well as intra vitam tests via oral or blood sample have been used. In doing so, the intra vitam tests matched the post mortem tests to 100 % (Kersten 2015) ...|$|R
2500|$|Hyperkinesia, {{also known}} as hyperkinesis, refers to an {{increase}} in muscular activity that can result in excessive abnormal movements, excessive normal movements, or a combination of both. The word hyperkinesis comes from the Greek hyper, meaning [...] "increased," [...] and kinein, meaning [...] "to move." [...] Hyperkinesia is a state of excessive restlessness which is featured in a large variety of disorders that affect the ability to control motor movement, such as Huntington's disease. It is the opposite of <b>hypokinesia,</b> which refers to decreased bodily movement, as commonly manifested in Parkinson's disease. Many hyperkinetic movements are the result of improper regulation of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry. Overactivity of a direct pathway combined with decreased activity of an indirect pathway results in activation of thalamic neurons and excitation of cortical neurons, resulting in increased motor output. Often, hyperkinesia is paired with hypotonia, a decrease in muscle tone. Many hyperkinetic disorders are psychological in nature and are typically prominent in childhood. Depending on the specific type of hyperkinetic movement, there are different treatment options available to minimize the symptoms, including different medical and surgical therapies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypokinesia</b> is {{displayed}} {{in the brain and}} outwardly slightly different depending on when an individual is first affected. In young-onset <b>hypokinesia</b> (younger than 45 years of age), typically slightly more cell loss occurs in the substantia nigra with more displayed dystonia and muscle stiffness. In old-onset <b>hypokinesia</b> (older than 70 years of age), typically more of a hypokinesic gait and difficulty walking and no dystonia are seen. Both onsets can display resting tremor, although more generally found in old-onset cases.|$|E

50|$|More {{men than}} women {{typically}} develop <b>hypokinesia,</b> which is reflected in young and middle-aged populations where females have displayed higher levels of nigrostriatal dopamine than males. In the elderly, however, this differentiation is not present. Typically, women exhibit more tremor in the beginning development of <b>hypokinesia.</b> In the disorder, men tend to display more rigidity and women more bradykinesic motor behavior.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypokinesia</b> {{refers to}} {{decreased}} bodily movement. One {{of the two}} categories of movement disorders, <b>hypokinesia</b> {{is characterized by a}} partial or complete loss of muscle movement due to a disruption in the basal ganglia. Patients with hypokinetic disorders like Parkinson's disease experience muscle rigidity and an inability to produce movement. It is also associated with mental health disorders and prolonged inactivity due to illness, amongst other diseases.|$|E
50|$|Once the {{reaction}} to dopaminergic drugs begins to fluctuate in Parkinson’s patients, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus and medial globus pallidus {{is often used to}} treat <b>hypokinesia.</b> DBS, like dopaminergic drugs, initially provides relief, but chronic use causes worse <b>hypokinesia</b> and freezing of gait. Lower-frequency DBS in irregular patterns {{has been shown to be}} more effective and less detrimental in treatment.|$|E
50|$|Often debated {{is whether}} the efficiency, vigor, and speed of {{movements}} in patients with <b>hypokinesia</b> are tied to motivation for rewarding and against punishing stimuli. The basal ganglia have been tied to the incentives behind movement, therefore suggesting a cost/benefit analysis of planned movement could be affected in <b>hypokinesia.</b> Interestingly, rewards have not been shown to change the aspects of a hypokinesic individual’s movement. In fact, the motor planning and control of a patient with <b>hypokinesia</b> is already as efficient as possible (as shown by slightly faster, but generally the same movement after deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus). This suggests that hypokinetic individuals simply have a narrower range of movement that does not increase relative to motivation.|$|E
50|$|The main {{neurotransmitter}} {{thought to}} be involved in <b>hypokinesia</b> is dopamine. Essential to the basal ganglionic-thalamocortical loop, which processes motor function, dopamine depletion is common in these areas of hypokinesic patients. Bradykinesia is correlated with lateralized dopaminergic depletion in the substantia nigra. The dopamine pathway in the substantia nigra is essential to motor function, and commonly a lesion in this area correlates with displayed <b>hypokinesia.</b> Tremor and rigidity, however, seem to be only partially due to dopamine deficits in the substantia nigra, suggesting other processes are involved in motor control. Treatments for <b>hypokinesia</b> often either attempt to prevent dopamine degradation by MAO-B or increase the amount of neurotransmitter present in the system.|$|E

5000|$|Stress causes {{alterations}} of cerebral circulation, increasing {{blood flow}} in the supramarginal gyrus and angular gyrus of the parietal lobe, the frontal lobe, and the superior temporal gyrus of the left hemisphere. Also, an increase in cardiac activity and change in the tonus of the heart vessels occurs, which is an elementary indication of stress development. In patients with normal stress, an adaptive fight-or-flight response is usually triggered by sympathetic nervous system activation. <b>Hypokinesia</b> patients experience these typical stress symptoms {{on a regular basis}} because of damage to the basal ganglia system. Therefore, when a <b>hypokinesia</b> victim is under stress, he or she does not display a typical fight-or-flight response, placing the patient under greater danger from potentially harmful stimuli. [...] Low-impact exercise, elimination of drug and alcohol use, and regular meditation can help to restore normal stress responses in <b>hypokinesia</b> patients.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{forms of}} motor deficits are {{associated}} with, but different from, motor neglect: directional <b>hypokinesia</b> and, motor neglect component [...] Directional <b>hypokinesia</b> {{refers to a}} deficit of startup of movements of ipsilesional limbs in contralesional space. Patients are slowed down {{when they have to}} perform an action with the non-neglected limb in space account side, despite preservation of control and motor coordination. Motor neglect component is similar to motor neglect but, unlike the latter, doesn't improve through direct verbal command, only through vestibular caloric stimulation.|$|E
50|$|Bradykinesia {{has been}} shown to precede {{impairment}} of executive functions, working memory, and attention. These cognitive deficiencies can be tied to nonfunction of the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex, which is also linked to the motor-dysfunction of <b>hypokinesia.</b> Tremor and rigidity have not had observable connections to cognitive impairments, supporting the idea that they are not as involved in the dopamine pathway in the basal ganglionic-thalamocortical loop.

50|$|Dopaminergic {{drugs are}} {{commonly}} used {{in the early stages}} of the <b>hypokinesia</b> to treat patients.

50|$|Other {{studies have}} come to the same {{conclusion}} about rewards and <b>hypokinesia,</b> but have shown that aversive stimuli can, in fact, reduce hypokinesic movement. Dopamine is either less involved or has a more complex role in the response to punishment than it does to rewards, as the hypodopaminergic striatum allows more movement in response to aversive stimuli.|$|E
50|$|Freezing of gait (FOG) {{is a major}} {{contributor}} of gait disturbances in Parkinson’s disease. There is impairment in controlling cadence that regulates stride to stride variations in gait timing and maintaining stable walking rhythm. It {{is a result of}} various factors with combination of <b>Hypokinesia</b> and sequence effect, severity and variability of sequence effect, severity of festination which depends on background level <b>Hypokinesia,</b> response to <b>Hypokinesia</b> to medications and the ability to focus on gait and visual cues, extrinsic environmental or attentional demands. There is a strong relation of Freezing of gait and turning. This involves reduced mediolateral deviation, a forward COM shift and decrease step width in freezers just before FOG episodes. These hamper fluent weight shifts required while turning. Cortical ChangesThe FOG is an outcome of dynamic process of hypo and hyper activation of cortical areas such as SMA and subcortical areas like striatum, mesencephalic locomotor region and pedunculopontine nucleus. Freezing of gait during turning and walking can be due to impaired cortical regulation of motor execution and reduced ability of mesencephalic structures to flexibly compensate for that alterations. Interhemispheric connection between bilateral parietal operculum, somatosensory cortex and primary auditory area are reduced in PD people with freezing of gait. Reorganization occurs in functional connections within the locomotor network to compensate loss of connectivity between STN and SMA and loss of lower order automatic control of gait by Basal Ganglia.|$|E
