50|$|Parker left Amsterdam in 1613 for Doesburg, Gelderland, {{where he}} preached to the garrison. There were various accusations against him arising {{from his book}} De Descensu ad Inferos, and he wrote several times to Paget as his friend asking him to help to clear him of <b>false</b> <b>imputations,</b> and thanking him for his efforts. He evidently hoped to return to Amsterdam, but never did so: he died at Doesburg in 1614 after having been there about 8 months.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012 {{speaking}} on the anti-corruption movement led by veteran social activist Anna Hazare, he alleged: [...] "He himself is involved in several cases of corruption. This has been proved by the apex court appointed Justice Sawant Commission. The commission found that Anna runs several NGOs and money was spent illegally for his birthday celebration," [...] He alleged that the so-called [...] "Team Anna" [...] is composed of [...] "armchair fascists, overground Maoists, closet anarchists funded by invisible donors,". Hazare sent a legal notice to Tewari for defamation stating that Tewari had committed an offence under sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code and called him to [...] "apologise with written application by him and {{on behalf of his}} party, the (Indian National Congress), undertaking not to commit such <b>false</b> <b>imputations</b> and defamatory statements about Hazare in future". Later Tewari regretted his statement stating that much is said in political debate.|$|R

It remains next, that I show also their care, conduct, and discipline as a Christian and reformed society, {{that they might be}} found living up to their own principles and profession. And this the rather, because they have hardly suffered more in their character from the unjust charge of error, than by the <b>false</b> <b>imputation</b> of disorder: which calumny, indeed, has not failed to follow all the true steps that were ever made to reformation, and under which reproach none suffered more than the primitive Christians themselves, that were the honour of Christianity, and the great lights and examples of their own and succeeding ages.|$|E
5000|$|In Argentina, {{the crimes}} of calumny and injury are {{foreseen}} in the chapter [...] "Crimes Against Honor" [...] (Articles 109 to 117-bis) of the Penal Code. Calumny is defined as [...] "the <b>false</b> <b>imputation</b> to a determined person of a concrete crime {{that leads to a}} lawsuit" [...] (Article 109). However, expressions referring to subjects of public interest or that are not assertive don't constitute calumny. Penalty is a fine from 3,000 to 30,000 pesos. He who intentionally dishonor or discredit a determined person is punished with a penalty from 1,500 to 20,000 pesos (Article 110).|$|E

60|$|The {{session of}} '48 {{had been one}} of unexampled length, having lasted ten months, and, as usual under such circumstances, the {{obstacles}} to the transaction of public business were sought everywhere except in the real quarter. The forms of the House and the propensity to unnecessary discussion among its members were chiefly denounced. Lord George Bentinck did not agree in the justness of these criminations; they were eagerly caught by the thoughtless and the superficial, but it was his habit to investigate and analyze everything, and he found that these charges had no basis. The forms of the House of Commons are the result of accumulated experience and have rarely been tampered with successfully, while on the other hand a parliamentary government is by name and nature essentially a government of discussion. It is not at all difficult to conceive a mode of governing a country more expeditious than by a parliament; but where truth as well as strength is held to be an essential element of legislation, opinion must be secured an unrestricted organ. Superfluity of debate may often be inconvenient to a minister, and sometimes perhaps even distasteful to the community; but criticizing such a security for justice and liberty as a free-spoken parliament is like quarrelling with the weather because there is too much rain or too much sunshine. The casual inconvenience should be forgotten in the permanent blessing. Acting upon these <b>false</b> <b>imputations</b> a committee was even appointed, two years ago, of the most eminent members of the House of Commons, to investigate the subject and suggest remedies, and some votaries of the Transatlantic type recommended the adoption of the rules of Congress where each speaker is limited to an hour. But an hour from an uninteresting speaker would be a great infliction. The good sense and the good taste of the House of Commons will be found on the whole to be the best regulators of the duration of a debate.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Clustering {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to analyze only complete data. Although sometimes encounter data sets that contain one or more missing feature values (incomplete data), traditional clustering methods cannot be used for such data. Missing value handling is an important preparation step for clustering of partially missing data sets, and inappropriate treatment of missing data in clustering may cause large errors or <b>false</b> results. The <b>imputation</b> approach is used for incomplete data. IFCMwUNC clustering algorithm, the problems of the unknown clusters number and the initialization of prototypes in the FCM clustering algorithm for symbolic interval-values data are overcome. IFCMwUNC clustering algorithm can be fast converges in a few iterations regardless of the initial number of clusters...|$|R
50|$|Leonor {{persuaded her}} brother João Afonso Telo 6th Count of Barcelos and Alcaide-Mór (noble magistrate) of Lisbon, to insinuate {{the idea in}} the mind of the Infante that his {{marriage}} to her daughter, the heiress presumptive Beatrice (who was promised to John I of Castile), would find favour with the people and clear his way to the throne. With the <b>false</b> <b>imputation</b> that his present wife María had been unfaithful to him, transmitted by Leonora through John Alfonso, Infante John became so enraged that he stabbed María in Coimbra. In one single coup, Leonor Teles got disentangled of her sister and brought such opprobrium upon the name of her brother-in-law, that his hopes of succeeding to the throne were much diminished.|$|E
5000|$|In Chile, {{the crimes}} of calumny and slanderous {{allegation}} (injurias) are covered by Articles 412 to 431 of the Penal Code. Calumny is defined as [...] "the <b>false</b> <b>imputation</b> of a determined crime and {{that can lead to}} a public prosecution" [...] (Article 412). If the calumny is written and with publicity, penalty is [...] "lower imprisonment" [...] in its medium degree plus a fine of 11 to 20 [...] "vital wages" [...] when it refers to a crime, or [...] "lower imprisonment" [...] in its minimum degree plus a fine of 6 to 10 [...] "vital wages" [...] when it refers to a misdemeanor (Article 413).

40|$|Falsely {{identifying}} {{someone as}} lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) {{has historically been}} defamation per se in American courts. In modern times, however, courts have become conflicted as to whether a <b>false</b> <b>imputation</b> of a person as LGB is defamatory. Accordingly, {{this article examines the}} roots of defamation law as it relates to sexual minorities, and then examines questions regarding the defamatory status of false identification of another as LGB, whether community or national standards should drive such a determination, and finally, to what degree is any legal recognition of harm to reputation for being LBG a perpetuation of the status quo for sexual minorities. Recent case law involving the <b>false</b> <b>imputation</b> of LGB status shows the confusion emanating from changes on all matters related to sexual orientation in the United States - courts seem to be randomly ruling gay defamation legitimate or not. This article argues that there is no continuing justification for deeming <b>false</b> <b>imputation</b> of an individual as being gay, lesbian, or bisexual defamatory, even in locales where community standards illustrate negative attitudes toward LGB individuals. Specifically, because sodomy laws have been abolished nationwide, gay defamation cases function as state-driven perpetuation of denigration of sexual minorities, which is the opposite of the trajectory of American law regarding sexual orientation. Because empirical evidence of Arkansans 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward homosexual behavior and status is so clearly negative, traditional defamation law would likely dictate that <b>false</b> <b>imputation</b> as LGB in Arkansas is harmful to an individual’s reputation. Such a result would stymie an otherwise mostly pro-equality shift in Arkansas law. Accordingly, the article concludes that it is important for Arkansas courts to refuse to perpetuate biases against gays, lesbians, and bisexuals through recognition of <b>false</b> <b>imputation</b> of a person as LGB as defamatory...|$|E

He contends, among other things, that the report conveyed the <b>false</b> and defamatory <b>imputations</b> that, as Prime Minister, he:a. had permitted big business donors to dictate government policy, and had allowedpublic assets to be sold to some of those donors in repayment for their donations;b. had abused, and was unfit to hold, public office in that he had permitted a debtincurred by his party in the election campaign to be written off by awarding agovernment contract to the creditor;c. was corrupt and deceitful in that he had accepted gifts of shares and profits on sharetrading from a leading business figure, and had permitted that figure to set up a sharetrading account on his behalf, all in return for permitting the business figure toinfluence government policy in favour of business interests.|$|R
40|$|As {{the amount}} of data from genome wide {{association}} studies grows dramatically, many interesting scientific questions require imputation to combine or expand datasets. However, there are two situations for which imputation has been problematic: (1) polymorphisms with low minor allele frequency (MAF), and (2) datasets where subjects are genotyped on different platforms. Traditional measures of imputation cannot effectively address these problems. We introduce a new statistic, the imputation quality score (IQS). In order to differentiate between well-imputed and poorly-imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), IQS adjusts the concordance between imputed and genotyped SNPs for chance. We first evaluated IQS in relation to minor allele frequency. Using a sample of subjects genotyped on the Illumina 1 M array, we extracted those SNPs that were also on the Illumina 550 K array and imputed them to the full set of the 1 M SNPs. As expected, the average IQS value drops dramatically with a decrease in minor allele frequency, indicating that IQS appropriately adjusts for minor allele frequency. We then evaluated whether IQS can filter poorly-imputed SNPs in situations where cases and controls are genotyped on different platforms. Randomly dividing the data into "cases" and "controls", we extracted the Illumina 550 K SNPs from the cases and imputed the remaining Illumina 1 M SNPs. The initial Q-Q plot for the test of association between cases and controls was grossly distorted (lambda = 1. 15) and had 4016 <b>false</b> positives, reflecting <b>imputation</b> error. After filtering out SNPs with IQS 0. 99 demonstrating that a database of IQS values from common imputations {{could be used as}} an effective filter to combine data genotyped on different platforms. IQS effectively differentiates well-imputed and poorly-imputed SNPs. It is particularly useful for SNPs with low minor allele frequency and when datasets are genotyped on different platforms...|$|R
40|$|The United Kingdom Government {{recently}} {{expressed concern}} about the financial repercussions that feigned whiplash claims following road traffic accidents (RTAs) are having on the insurance industry and the United Kingdom economy. Indeed, this is a problem that is a likely result of a significant percentage of otherwise law-abiding citizens, who interpret this behaviour to be victimless. Nevertheless, feigning illness for some external incentive is not new, and psychiatry has long battled with the problem of ‘malingering’. Previous research has indicated that a substantial prevalence of malingering exists across a variety of contexts; however, establishing the ground truth of those who malinger for financial compensation is problematic. This article presents an alternative approach that provides a brief insight into the problem of malingering following a RTA. A total of 197 United Kingdom residents completed a hypothetical questionnaire that examined their likelihood of malingering with respect to depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or whiplash following a RTA. The results suggest that a substantial percentage of those in the present sample indicated they would be likely to malinger using either a partial malingering or a <b>false</b> <b>imputation</b> strategy. Malingering following a RTA in the United Kingdom appears to be regarded with little severity, and the present paper discusses the wider implications of the findings...|$|E
40|$|Malingered {{posttraumatic}} stress disorder (PTSD) poses a formidable clinical challenge in personal injury and disability cases because of the apparent ease in feigning PTSD and the supposed link (proximate cause) to the claimed damages. The effective assessment of feigned PTSD is particularly challenging because this diagnosis is both easier to fake than other Axis I disorders {{and more difficult to}} detect. As an additional confound, some patients with genuine PTSD produce highly variable, elevated profiles on multiscale inventories that are difficult to distinguish from feigned PTSD. The current study examined whether the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) can effectively differentiate between genuine and feigned PTSD in 109 inpatients from a trauma unit. The two most effective scales were the MAL and the NDS scales. As a primary focus, the current study was the first empirical investigation of Resnick's model of malingered PTSD that is comprised of three subtypes: pure malingering (pure-M), partial malingering (partial-M), and <b>false</b> <b>imputation</b> (false-I). The primary goal was to evaluate whether each feigning group was able to (a) effectively simulate PTSD symptoms and diagnoses and (b) avoid being classified as feigning. The partial-M group proved to be the best feigning group in achieving these two goals. Furthermore, the use of well-defined groups, including an indeterminate band (i. e., unclassified) around each cut score, was explored. Overall, the use of well-defined groups improved accuracy in classification and reduced the number of false-positives...|$|E
