30|$|Intermodal {{dispersion}} (also called modal dispersion) is {{the phenomenon}} {{that the group}} velocity of light propagating in a multimode fiber (or other waveguide) depends {{not only on the}} optical frequency (chromatic dispersion) but also on the propagation mode involved. The strength of intermodal dispersion can be quantified as the differential mode delay (DMD). It depends strongly on the refractive index profile of the fiber in and around the fiber core. For example, for a step-index profile the higher-order modes have lower group velocities, and this can lead to differential group delays of the order of 10 ps/m = 10 ns/km. It is then hardly possible to realize data rates of multiple Gbit/s in an fiber-optic link with a kilometer length. In systems for optical fiber communications based on multimode fibers, intermodal dispersion can severely limit the achievable data transmission rate (bit rate). In order to avoid strong signal distortion, it is usually necessary to keep the pulses long enough to maintain a reasonable temporal overlap of components from different modes, and this unavoidably sets a limit on the data rate. The natural way of eliminating intermodal dispersion is to use fiber links based on single-mode fibers, but intermodal dispersion can also be minimized by using multimode fibers with a parabolic refractive index profile, where intermodal dispersion is minimized. In case of <b>graded</b> <b>index</b> <b>fiber,</b> critical angle condition is satisfied at different distances from the axis of the core for different modes as refractive index is decreasing from the axis up to core cladding interface. The wave which is internally reflected near axis travel less distance but will also have low velocity due to higher refractive index. On the other hand, wave reflected near the interface will travel more distance but with higher velocity due to smaller refractive index. Hence, the time to reach the other end will be same for these waves which means no intermodal dispersion.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{we report}} {{the results of}} our {{theoretical}} and experimental studies of large core polymer fibers. This relatively low loss and high bandwidth plastic optical fiber (POF) potentially have important applications in LAN. ^ We measured the power penalty due to modal noise. We also developed a model to calculate the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and the bit error rate (BER) floor just by knowing the coupling coefficient in the mode selective loss being considered. The calculated bandwidth using the WKB approximation was found to be 0. 44 GHz per 100 m, which is much lower than the measured bandwidth of 3 GHz per 100 m. This discrepancy was explained by the presence of strong mode coupling in POFs. ^ We studied distortions products in CATV systems. Composite second order (CSO) and composite triple beat (CTB) for different channels were measured using a spectrum analyzer and adjustable band pass filter. Since the CSO and the CTB did not meet the CATV standard, a predistortion circuit was used to minimize CSO and CTB products produced by the laser. The predistortion circuit provides a signal comprising multiple subcarrier signals substantially equal in magnitude and opposite in phase to those associated with the nonlinear transfer function of the laser being deployed. The RF signal is split into a primary branch that has a time delayed portion (80 % of the RF signal), the secondary branch (10 % of the RF signal) is where the second order products are generated with a 180 °phase shift from the fundamental, and the last remaining 10 % of the RF signal is where the third order distortion products are generated with a 180 °phase shift from the fundamental. The output signal is taken as the summation of three signals processed by the branch circuits and coupled to the directly to the laser to be linearized. ^ Finally, using cyclic transparent optical polymer (CYTOP), a perfluorinated <b>graded</b> <b>index</b> <b>fiber,</b> different transmission characteristics were investigated.

Comparison reveals that averaging processes on the index data are usually necessary to account for noncircularity of the fiber and small variations in the deduced profile caused by the wavelength dependence of the near-field intensity distribution. Results obtained by this means usually tend to slightly underestimate the true fiber bandwidth, while alpha-profile predictions always result in overestimates by about one order of magnitude. Remaining discrepancies between measured and predicted bandwidths are attributed to small variations of the index profiles along the fiber length...|$|R
