50|$|A chatbot (also {{known as}} a talkbot, chatterbot, Bot, chatterbox, IM bot, <b>interactive</b> <b>agent,</b> or Artificial Conversational Entity) is a {{computer}} program which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some chatterbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simpler systems scan for keywords within the input, then pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a database.|$|E
50|$|The rapid {{success of}} SmarterChild led to {{targeted}} promotional products for Radiohead, Austin Powers, The Sporting News, and others. ActiveBuddy sought {{to strengthen its}} hold on the <b>interactive</b> <b>agent</b> market for the future by filing for, and receiving, a controversial patent on their creation in 2002. The company also released the BuddyScript SDK, a free developer kit that allow programmers to design and launch their own interactive agents using ActiveBuddy’s proprietary scripting language, in 2002. Ultimately, however, the decline in ad spending in 2001 and 2002 led to a shift in corporate strategy towards business focused Automated Service Agents, building products for clients including Cingular, Comcast and Cox Communications. The company subsequently changed its name from ActiveBuddy to Conversagent in 2003, and then again to Colloquis in 2006. Colloquis was later purchased by Microsoft in October 2006.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the implementation of interactive agents capable of gathering and extending their knowledge. Interactive agents are designed to perform tasks requested by a user in natural language. Using simple sentences the agent can answer questions and in case a task can not be fulfilled the agent must communicate with the user. In particular, an <b>interactive</b> <b>agent</b> can tell when necessary information for a task is missing, giving the user a chance to supply this information, which may in effect result in teaching the agent. The <b>interactive</b> <b>agent</b> platform is implemented in DLP, a tool {{for the implementation of}} 3 D web agents. In this paper we discuss the motivation for interactive agents, the learning mechanisms and it’s realization in the DLP platform...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze how {{heterogeneous}} behaviors of agents influence the exchange rate dynamic in the short and long term. We will examine how agents use information and what kind of information, in order to make their decisions to anticipate the exchange rate. We will investigate methodology based on <b>interactive</b> <b>agent</b> simulations, following the Santa Fe Artificial Stock Market. Each trader is modeled as an autonomous, <b>interactive</b> <b>agent</b> and the aggregation of their behavior results in foreign exchange market dynamics. Genetic algorithm is the tool used to compute agents, and the simulated market tends to replicate the real EUR/USD exchange rate market. We will consider four kinds of agents with pure behavior: fundamentalists, positive and negative feedback traders, naive traders, news traders (positive and negative). To reproduce stylized facts of the exchange rate dynamic, we conclude that the key factor is the correct proportion of each agent type, without any need of mimetic behaviors, adaptive agents or pure noisy agents...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To be sociable, {{embodied}} <b>interactive</b> <b>agents</b> like virtual characters or humanoid robots {{need to be}} able {{to engage}} in mutual coordination of behaviors, beliefs, and relationships with their human interlocutors.

We present work on probabilistic models for these three requirements with a focus on gestural behavior. ...|$|R

It is the major source of revenue for most travel agencies, and success or failure in the market determines the long-term prosperity or closure of the business. This study aims to identify the important travel agency selection factors in relation to choosing a travel agency for all-inclusive package tours, as perceived by Hong Kong consumers. A total of 183 Hong Kong consumers were surveyed and were asked to rate 29 attributes that might affect their choice of travel agency for all-inclusive package tours. Results showed that of the 29 attributes, "agency reputation" was rated as the most important attribute in travel agency selection, followed by "word-of-mouth communication" and "staff attitude.

40|$|Abstract: Technological {{developments}} are bringing <b>interactive</b> computer <b>agents,</b> such as Apple’s Siri, into {{our everyday lives}} and routines. These <b>interactive</b> <b>agents</b> {{are designed to be}} the focus of our interactions – we can feel “present” with them. Yet current theories of “presence” in IS do not account for the question {{of what it means to}} be present with technology in an experiential sense. In response we draw on existential philosophy in order to generate a research agenda for conceptualising presence in the context of what we term human-computer engagement. We suggest that research from this new perspective requires focusing on the situated interaction rather than an a-priori assessment of the entities involved. We conclude by considering the ethical questions that emerge when technology is experienced as being an independent agent with which one can be present...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} more <b>interactive</b> interface <b>agents.</b> This more <b>interactive</b> style of <b>agents</b> aims to increase the trust and understanding between user and agent, by allowing the agent, under certain conditions, to solicit further input from the user about his preferences and desires. With the user and agent engaging in specific clarification dialogues, the user's input is employed to adjust the agent's model of the user. Moreover, the user is provided with an ability to view this user model, under certain well defined circumstances. Since both the agent and user can take the initiative to interact, basic issues regarding mixed-initiative systems arise. These issues are addressed in our model, which also takes care to restrict the agent's interaction with the user, to avoid bothering the user unduly. We illustrate our design for more <b>interactive</b> interface <b>agents</b> by including some examples {{in the domain of}} electronic mail. Keywords: user modeling agents, personal [...] ...|$|R
