5000|$|In Fortran 77, {{variable}} names {{beginning with}} the letters I-N had a <b>default</b> <b>type</b> of integer, while variables starting with any other letters defaulted to real, although programmers could override the defaults with an explicit declaration. This led to the joke: [...] "In Fortran, GOD is REAL (unless declared INTEGER)." ...|$|E
5000|$|Pascal {{requires}} all {{variable and}} function declarations to specify their type explicitly. In traditional C, a type name {{may be omitted}} in most contexts and the <b>default</b> <b>type</b> [...] (which corresponds to [...] in Pascal) is then implicitly assumed (however, such defaults are considered bad practice in C and are often flagged by warnings).|$|E
5000|$|However, many Java {{language}} {{features are}} {{not supported by}} Java Card (in particular types char, double, float and long; the [...] qualifier; enums; arrays {{of more than one}} dimension; finalization; object cloning; threads). Further, some common features of Java are not provided at runtime by many actual smart cards (in particular type , which is the <b>default</b> <b>type</b> of a Java expression; and garbage collection of objects).|$|E

50|$|A {{transitional}} {{representative council}} (Afrikaans: Verteenwoordigende oorgangsraad) {{is a local}} administrative division in South Africa. Between 1994 and 2000 it was the <b>default</b> <b>type</b> of municipal government. Every proclaimed village, town or city had its own transitional representative council. After apartheid it was created as a provisional local representation until {{the formation of a}} more final municipal structure. Due to the implementation of a municipal system in 2000, all - except one - transitional representative councils were abolished and their areas were merged into new municipalities.|$|E
5000|$|By default, if a {{variable}} {{has not been}} declared or if no type declaration character is specified, the variable is of type [...] However this can be changed with Deftype statements such as , , , , [...] There are 12 [...] statements in total offered by Visual Basic 6.0. The <b>default</b> <b>type</b> may be overridden for a specific declaration by using a special suffix character on the variable name ( [...] for Double, [...] for Single, [...] for Long, [...] for Integer, [...] for String, and [...] for Currency) or using the key phrase [...] VB can also be set in a mode that only explicitly declared variables {{can be used with}} the command [...]|$|E
50|$|XML data {{is stored}} in columns of DB2 tables that have the XML data type. XML data {{is stored in}} a parsed format that {{reflects}} the hierarchical nature of the original XML data. As such, pureXML uses trees and nodes as its model for storing and processing XML data. If you instruct DB2 to validate XML data against an XML schema prior to storage, DB2 annotates all nodes in the XML hierarchy with information about the schema types; otherwise, it will annotate the nodes with <b>default</b> <b>type</b> information. Upon storage, DB2 preserves the internal structure of XML data, converting its tag names and other information into integer values. Doing so helps conserve disk space and also improves the performance of queries that use navigational expressions. However, users aren't aware of this internal representation. Finally, DB2 automatically splits XML nodes across multiple database pages, as needed.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{computer}} file system, a fork {{is a set}} of data associated with a file system object. File systems without forks only allow a single such set of data for the contents, while file systems with forks allow multiple such contents. Every non-empty file must have at least one fork, often of <b>default</b> <b>type,</b> and depending on the file system, a file may have one or more other associated forks, which in turn may contain primary data integral to the file, or just metadata. Unlike extended attributes, a similar file system feature which is typically of fixed size, forks can be of variable size, possibly even larger than the file's primary data fork. The size of a file is the sum of the sizes of each fork. Forks are also known as streams, since they are of variable size (unlike fixed size metadata), but this differs from [...]|$|E
5000|$|Any file {{may be used}} as {{a program}} file. A program file {{contains}} elements which generally act as files. Element naming is Qualifier*Filename(f-cycle).Element/version(e-cycle) (e.g., [...] "PERSONNEL*PROGRAMS.TAXCALC/2008"). Element and version are twelve-character names used in any way a user desires. E-cycle is similar to f-cycle in that it represents a generation number but without the restriction to 32 concurrent cycles and the limit is 256K cycles. However, e-cycle only applies to text elements and each line in a text element is marked with the cycle numbers at which it was inserted and deleted. Elements also have a type and sub-type. The most commonly used types are [...] "text" [...] and [...] "object." [...] If the <b>default</b> <b>type</b> is not suitable, options select the appropriate type. Text elements also have sub-types that typically represent the programming language (e.g., [...] "ASM", [...] "C", [...] "COB", [...] "FOR"). The default element name of an object file {{is the same as the}} text file from which it was created.|$|E
5000|$|All these {{courts are}} {{distinguished}} from courts of general jurisdiction (also known as [...] "superior jurisdiction"), {{which are the}} <b>default</b> <b>type</b> of trial court that can hear any case which {{is not required to}} be first heard in a court of limited jurisdiction. Most such cases are civil cases involving large sums of money or criminal trials arising from serious crimes like rape and murder. Typically, felonies are handled in general jurisdiction courts, while misdemeanors and other lesser offenses are handled in inferior jurisdiction courts. Unlike most European courts (in both common law and civil law countries), American state courts do not usually have a separate court that handles serious crimes; jurisdiction lies with the court that handles all other felony cases in a given county. But, many state courts that handle criminal cases have separate divisions or judges assigned to handle certain types of crimes such as a drug court, sometimes also known as a [...] "problem-solving court".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new static type system for multithreaded programs; any well-typed program {{in our system}} is free of data races. Our type system is significantly more expressive than previous such type systems. In particular, our system lets programmers write generic code to implement a class, then create different objects of the same class that have different protection mechanisms. This exibility enables programmers {{to reduce the number}} of unnecessary synchronization operations in a program without risking data races. We also support <b>default</b> <b>types</b> which reduce the burden of writing the extra type annotations. Our experience indicates that our system provides a promising approach to make multithreaded programs more reliable and efficient...|$|R

It is the city's only remaining swing bridge, the <b>default</b> bridge <b>type</b> in Stockholm during the 19th century. It has been closed since 1966.|$|R
5000|$|Like the {{original}} Microsoft BASIC interpreter, {{on which it}} is based, Commodore BASIC is slower than native machine code. Test results have shown that copying 16 kilobytes from ROM to RAM takes {{less than a second}} in machine code, compared to over a minute in BASIC. To execute faster than the interpreter, programmers started using various techniques to speed up execution. One was to store often-used floating point values in variables rather than using literal values, as interpreting a variable name was faster than interpreting a literal number. Since floating point is <b>default</b> <b>type</b> for all commands, it's faster to use floating point numbers, rather than integers. When speed was important, some programmers converted sections of BASIC programs to 6502 or 6510 assembly language which were loaded separately from a file, or POKEed into memory from DATA statements {{at the end of the}} BASIC program, and executed from BASIC using the [...] command either from direct mode or from the program itself. When the execution speed of machine language was too great, such as for a game or when waiting for user input, programmers could poll by ing selected memory locations (such as $A6 for the C-64, or $D0 for the C-128, denoting size of the keyboard queue) to delay or halt execution.|$|E
5000|$|Unique movesets {{for each}} {{character}} {{have been largely}} reduced. Only characters who have Musou Mode receive original movesets (with the exception of Diao Chan); {{the rest of the}} characters playable only in Free Mode have cloned movesets based on the Musou Mode characters with altered properties (with the exception of Xiao Qiao, who retains her fan moveset). Due to the addition of Renbu system, the traditional [...] "fourth weapon" [...] from previous games have been removed with the three normal weapons no longer being quality-based. Each weapons obtained have random stats and effects implemented and the [...] "weight system" [...] from previous game have been replaced by weapon categories; Standard (<b>default</b> <b>type),</b> Strength (greater attack power at the cost of Renbu Gauge being kept for a smaller amount of time), and Skill (greater attack speed with low attack power). In addition to the new weapon system, it is now possible to block from any direction, for example, if a character is attacked from behind while blocking, they will rotate their body with their weapon in front of them to guard against the enemy's attack. This eliminates the need to quickly stop blocking, change direction, and press the guard button again. Unlike previous games, horses can be found by obtaining saddles randomly dropped from boxes or beaten officers. These horses can gain levels, skills, and some can even change into the legendary Red Hare, although this is very rare.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is a study of {{impedance}} cardiography and its subsequent use in determining the cardiac output. The calculation in this work uses three <b>default</b> <b>types</b> of biological signals: the ECG signal to gallop and the impedance cardiography. There are identified the necessary parameters of the signals, especially heart rate, heart sounds (S 1,S 2) and the derivative impedance cardiography. This method of determining cardiac output is non-invasive and is easy to perform for doctor and patient, which {{is very important for}} risky patient especialy. Disadvantage is imprecision, that is eliminated by modifying the algorithm of the calculation. User interface for processing all the necessary signals and the subsequent calculation of cardiac output was implemented in MATLAB programming environment and is optimized for data measured and processed in the ISI ASCR...|$|R
