5000|$|Today, Oildorado is a {{week long}} celebration during which many events are held. Oildorado {{is an ongoing}} {{testimony}} for Taft as a certified [...] "Oil Town"—its origins owing solely to oil production and exploration, a rare distinction among any town in the world. As such, there are several oilfield-type skill contests held during each Oildorado. These include or have included: welding, pipe threading and <b>fitting,</b> <b>rod</b> wrenching, various skill tests with a backhoe, and at least as late as 1965 a regular well-pulling contest with local well-servicing rigs and crews. Understandably, owing to safety and probably liability issues, the well-pulling contests ceased. Much more {{could be said of}} these various contests and their participants through the years, it being quite memorable for those who were there.|$|E

50|$|Traditional scroll mounters {{go through}} a lengthy process of backing the {{mounting}} silks with paper using paste before creating the borders for the scroll. Afterwards, the whole scroll is backed before the roller and fittings are attached. The whole process can take two weeks to nine months depending on how long the scroll is left on the wall to dry and stretch before finishing by polishing the back with Chinese wax and <b>fitting</b> the <b>rod</b> and roller at either end. This process is generally called 'wet mounting' due {{to the use of}} wet paste in the process.|$|R

500|$|To {{make the}} R as compact as possible, several design {{modifications}} {{were made in}} comparison to the Buzzard: the propeller reduction gear housing was reshaped, and the camshaft and rocker covers were modified to fair into the shape of the aircraft's nose, the air intake was positioned in the vee of the engine (which also helped to avoid the ingress of spray), and beneath the engine the auxiliaries were raised a little to reduce the depth of the fuselage. The engine's length was minimised by not staggering its cylinder banks fore and aft, which meant that the connecting rods from opposing cylinders had to share a short crankshaft bearing journal known as the [...] "big end". This was initially achieved by <b>fitting</b> one connecting <b>rod</b> inside the other at the lower end in a blade and fork arrangement; however, after cracking of the connecting rods was found during testing in 1931, the rod design was changed to an articulated type.|$|R
2500|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{maintenance}} headaches and catastrophic failures were the engines. Although the Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radial engines later became a trustworthy workhorse in large piston-engined aircraft, early models were beset with dangerous reliability problems. This problem was not fully cured until the aircraft was fitted with the more powerful Pratt & Whitney R-4360 [...] "Wasp Major" [...] in the B-29D/B-50 program, which arrived too late for World War II. Interim measures included cuffs placed on propeller blades to divert a greater flow of cooling air into the intakes which had baffles installed to direct a stream of air onto the exhaust valves. Oil flow to the valves was also increased, asbestos baffles installed around rubber push <b>rod</b> <b>fittings</b> to prevent oil loss, thorough pre-flight inspections made to detect unseated valves, and frequent replacement of the uppermost five cylinders (every 25 hours of engine time) and the entire engines (every 75 hours).|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{model of}} a contaminated open fracture has been developed in rabbits, using a reproducible midshaft fracture of the tibia. This model has been used to: 1) Test the hypothesis that stable fixation of an open fracture will reduce its susceptibility to infection. 2) Assess the effect of antibiotics on infection rate, with particular reference to the delay in administering the initial dose. The pattern of fracture healing was initially determined for stable and unstable fixation, without inoculation with bacteria. Fractures fixed with a dynamic compression plate ("stable" group) healed by primary bone union, while fractures stabilised with a loose-fitting intramedullary rod ("unstable" group) healed by external callus formation. Forty- one rabbits {{were used in the}} definitive study of the effect of stability. All fractures were inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus in a standard concentration. There were twenty rabbits in the stable group (compression plate) and osteomyelitis developed in seven (35 %). Of the twenty- one rabbits in the unstable group (loose- <b>fitting</b> intramedullary <b>rod),</b> fifteen (71 %) became infected. This difference in infection rate is statistically significant (p< 0. 02). The "rod- fixed fracture" model had the highest infection rate and was therefore used to study the effect of antibiotics. Fifty-one rabbits were used; a single intramuscular injection of cephradine was given to each animal at varying times in relation to inoculation with bacteria. Although the maximal reduction in infection rate was observed when the antibiotic was given before inoculation with bacteria, a 40 % decrease in the infection rate was still seen when the antibiotic was given after bacterial inoculation. This effect persisted even if the initial dose of antibiotic was delayed four hours after inoculation. These findings support the concept of stabilisation of open fractures in man; and suggest that appropriate systemic antibiotics should be routinely used in the management of open fractures in man, even if the treatment is delayed up to four hours after injury...|$|R
5000|$|The R was a {{physically}} imposing engine {{designed by a}} team led by Ernest Hives and including Cyril Lovesey, Arthur Rowledge and Henry Royce. The R shared the Buzzard's bore, stroke and capacity, and used the same 60-degree V-12 layout. A new single-stage, double-sided supercharger impeller was designed along with revised cylinders and strengthened connecting rods. The wet-liner cylinder blocks, crankcase and propeller reduction gear castings were produced from [...] "R.R 50" [...] aluminium alloy; and because of the short life expectancy of these engines, forged aluminium was used to replace bronze and steel in many parts. To make the R as compact as possible, several design modifications were made in comparison to the Buzzard: the propeller reduction gear housing was reshaped, and the camshaft and rocker covers were modified to fair into the shape of the aircraft's nose, the air intake was positioned in the vee of the engine (which also helped to avoid the ingress of spray), and beneath the engine the auxiliaries were raised a little to reduce the depth of the fuselage.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of a Surface X-Ray Diffraction (SXRD) study of Fe nanostructured films depositedon c(2 × 2) -N/Cu(100) at room {{temperature}} (RT), with Fe coverage ΘFe= 0. 5 ML and ΘFe= 1 ML. Thec(2 × 2) -N/Cu(100) surface is an example of self-organised system, {{that can be used for}} growth of arraysof metal nano-islands and organic molecules assemblies. We chose two different values of N coverage,ΘN= 0. 3 ML and ΘN= 0. 5 ML, the second value corresponding to N saturation. We monitored the presenceof surface diffraction peaks in hk scans and we performed Crystal Truncation Rods (CTR) analysiswith <b>ROD</b> <b>fitting</b> programme. In the case of ΘN= 0. 5 ML, i. e. at saturation coverage, the CTR could be fittedwith one surface domain with p 4 gm(2 × 2) symmetry. In the surface cell adopted, N atoms occupy fourfoldhollow sites, with Fe (intermixed with Cu) giving rise to a “clock” reconstruction previously observedon iron nitride films obtained by co-deposition and annealing. This result is an indirect confirmation of Nsurface segregation on top of the Fe films, occurring during the growth at RT. When subsaturation N coverage(ΘN= 0. 3 ML) is used as a substrate for Fe deposition, the best results could be obtained with amodel where two surface domains are present: the first one corresponds to a surface cell with Fe sittingin four-fold hollow sites on bare Cu areas, with possible interdiffusion in the second lattice. The seconddomain is assigned to growth of Fe on the N-covered square islands occurring once the bare Cu areasare fully covered. The SXRD analysis on N-covered surface domains shows that the mechanism of reconstructionand of N segregation on top layer is already active at RT for all N-coverage values...|$|R
40|$|The SINQ Target Irradiation Program (STIP) {{has been}} {{developed}} at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) during the last twenty years. It is aimed to analyze the radiation damage induced by spallation reactions in different structural materials. It is also providing relevant data for developing future spallation sources as well as advanced spallation targets. STIP VI was conducted in SINQ Target 9 during 2011 / 2012 receiving a total proton charge of 13. 16 Ah. The Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended code (MCNPX) is used for implementing the model and performing the simulation to obtain the proton and neutron fluences {{as well as the}} energy deposition in the different points of interest. Afterwards, this information is used for calculating the displacement per atom (dpa) plus the Helium and Hydrogen production in atomic parts per million (appm). The results will contribute to understand the irradiation effect in different structural materials. It will also be useful for comparing it with the real radiation damage measurements of the irradiated materials after its cool down period. The target mainly consists of the AlMg 3 inverted semi-sphere Beam Entrance Window (BEW) and the cylindrical Rod Container Box (RCB) which keeps inside 306 <b>rods</b> <b>fitting</b> 36 rows. There is also the Safety Hull Tube (SHT), made of AlMg 3, which consists of a double cylinder walls surrounding the RCB and linked to the inverted BEW at the bottom. The source definition is implemented in the MCNPX input file from the gamma mapping performed at the irradiated Target 9. The material specification of the specimen rods is implemented by taking its average composition, assuming a uniform distribution. The maximum proton flux obtained at the inverted BEW is 1. 75 x 1014 p/(cm 2 ·s·mA). The maximum proton fluence in the target is obtained in Row 0 becoming 8. 33 x 1025 p/m 2. The maximum neutron fluence is obtained in Row 8 with a value of 1. 99 x 1026 n/m 2, which in flux units stands for 4. 19 x 1014 n/(cm 2 ·s·mA). Regarding the SHT, the maximum proton flux escaping from the target is obtained above Row 36 with a value of 5. 99 x 1011 p/(cm 2 ·s·mA) and the maximum neutron flux is escaping around the middle part of the target with a value of 1. 39 x 1014 n/(cm 2 ·s·mA). The maximum energy deposition in Zircaloy- 2 cladding tubes is obtained in the center rod placed in Row 2 with a value of 400. 32 W/(cm 3 ·mA). Page 2 The irradiation parameters have been calculated by multiplying the proton and neutron fluence with its corresponding material cross section data. The results obtained {{at the center of the}} inverted BEW are 8. 85 dpa, 2447 appm He and 4854 appm H. For the SHT, the maximum values of the irradiation parameters are obtained around the middle part of the target with the following values: 3. 14 dpa, 17. 63 appm He and 71. 64 appm H. Finally, the maximum displacement per atom in the specimen rods is obtained for Zircaloy- 2 in Rod 1, placed in Row 2, with a value of 72. 07 dpa and the maximum Helium & Hydrogen concentration are obtained for Tantalum in Rod A, placed in Row 1, with the following values: 3629 appm He and 17418 appm H...|$|R
