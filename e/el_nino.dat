5|$|In {{the eastern}} Pacific, Category5 hurricanes usually occur only in <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> years. During <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> years, {{conditions}} are more favorable for tropical cyclones because of warmer sea surface temperatures and reduced wind shear. This is why Category5s cluster in single seasons. The effects of <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> are most {{significant in the}} central Pacific (140°W to the dateline).|$|E
5|$|The El Niño–Southern Oscillation {{leads to}} changes in the {{atmospheric}} circulation patterns (also known as teleconnections). Although the exact mechanisms are unknown, the impacts of the changes in atmospheric circulation patterns caused by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation are more clearly observed in the more humid eastern parts of the country (between Uruguay and southern Brazil). During <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> events, precipitation is more higher than normal while during La Niña events, precipitation is lower than normal in the Pampas. In general, <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> tends to increase precipitation during late spring and summer, particularly in the north. The impacts of La Niña in the eastern parts of the country (northeast and the Pampas) are observed in winter where precipitation is lower. In Northwest Argentina, <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> events are associated with a strong reduction in rainfall during summer. In contrast, La Niña events increase precipitation in northwest Argentina. In the central–western parts of Patagonia, spring precipitation tends to be lower during La Niña events and higher during <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> events. Summer precipitation exhibits an opposite pattern where La Niña years involve wetter summers while <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> years featuring drier summers. On the Andes in central western Argentina, precipitation is higher during <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> year.|$|E
5|$|One of many {{exceptions}} to Seattle's {{reputation as a}} damp location occurs in <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> years, when marine weather systems track {{as far south as}} California and little precipitation falls in the Puget Sound area. Since the region's water comes from mountain snow packs during the dry summer months, <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> winters can not only produce substandard skiing but can result in water rationing and a shortage of hydroelectric power the following summer.|$|E

30|$|In {{the first}} conception, during <b>El</b> <b>Niños,</b> {{there is no}} {{anomalous}} shift {{in terms of the}} seasonal climate (considered as “normal”) of a region. Theoretically, the Köppen–Geiger classification for a region would not change. In the second conception, during <b>El</b> <b>Niños,</b> the expected climate regime in a given region would be altered temporarily, shifting to a different climate regime and, therefore, to different associated hydromet conditions for the season, which could be visualized using the Köppen–Geiger classification system.|$|R
5|$|The first {{forecast}} {{for the year}} was issued by CSU on December 11, who anticipated that one of four different scenarios could occur. The scenario considered most likely was that Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and thermohaline circulation (THC) would be stronger, but effects from <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> would remain, resulting in a slightly above average season. The next most likely scenario was that both the AMO and THC would strengthen and the <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> effects would cease to exist, causing a well above average season. In the other two scenarios, which were given the same probability of occurrence, the AMO and THC would weaken {{and the effects of}} <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> would either disappear or some would remain, resulting in either a near average or well below average season.|$|E
5|$|This {{does not}} mean that a Category5 {{hurricane}} cannot form outside of an <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> event. The entire year of 1959 was neither an <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> or a La Niña, but it had one Category5 hurricane (Patsy). Most of 1973 was during a La Niña, which reduces tropical cyclone activity in the eastern Pacific, yet Hurricane Ava, a Category 5 hurricane, formed in June of that year.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 118Category4 hurricanes have been {{recorded}} in the eastern and central Pacific basins since 1900. Only two Category4 hurricanes {{have been recorded}} in May, in addition to 12in June, 22in July, 29in August, 32in September, 18in October, and two in November. No Category4 storms have developed during the off-season. It is theorized that global warming was responsible for an increase of 13Category4 and 5 storms that developed in the eastern Pacific, from 36in the period of 1975–1989 to 49in the period of 1990–2004. It was estimated that if sea-surface temperatures ascended by 2 to 2.5degrees, the intensity of tropical cyclones would increase by 6–10% internationally. During years with {{the existence of an}} <b>El</b> <b>Niño,</b> sea-surface temperatures increase in the eastern Pacific, resulting in an increase in activity as vertical wind shear decreases in the Pacific; the opposite happens in the Atlantic basin during <b>El</b> <b>Niño,</b> when wind shear increases creating an unfavourable environment for tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic. Contrary to <b>El</b> <b>Niño,</b> La Niña increases wind shear over the eastern Pacific and reduces it over the Atlantic.|$|E
5000|$|The {{expansion}} of the tropics from overheating is usually thought to be gradual, but {{the percentage of the}} land surface in the two most extreme classifications of drought suddenly doubled in 1982 and stayed there until 1997 when it jumped to triple (after six years, it stepped down to double).

5|$|In general, La Niña {{events are}} {{associated}} with lower temperatures (particularly colder winters) in the Pampas. During winter, frosts are more common during La Niña events compared to <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> events. This {{is due to a}} stronger southerly flow during La Niña events caused by a higher concentration of high pressure systems in the South Pacific and an increase in cyclonic activity (more low pressure systems) in the South Atlantic. This creates conditions that are favourable for bringing cold air from the south, particularly when there is a formation of a high pressure system over Patagonia (associated with the passage of a front) that is responsible for bringing cold air from the south. Thus, invasions of cold air from the south are more common during La Niña events. In contrast, warm spells in the Pampas and northern parts of the country are more intense and frequent during <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> events. This is due to stronger westerly winds south of 40oS, leading to less frequent incursions of cold air from the south while enhancing winds from the north that bring in warm air. Although La Niña events lead to colder winters with more frequent incursions of cold air in both the north and central parts of the country, it leads to more frequent and intense warm spells in the last months of the year. In other regions, <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> events lead to more frequent and intense warm spells in Northwest Argentina (during autumn), northeast Argentina (during spring) and central Argentina (during summer). Cold air anomalies arising from <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> events are observed during spring and are the result of an increase in rainfall that lead to reductions in insolation. For the southern parts of the country, <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> events {{are associated with}} more intense and frequent cold spells during the coldest months. In summer, <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> events are associated with warmer summer temperatures in the southern parts of the country.|$|E
40|$|The {{representation}} of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) under historical forcing and future projections is analyzed in 34 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP 5). Most models realistically simulate the observed intensity and location of maximum sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies during ENSO events. However, there exist systematic biases in the westward extent of ENSOrelated SST anomalies, driven by unrealistic westward displacement and enhancement of the equatorial wind stress in the western Pacific. Almost all CMIP 5 models capture the observed asymmetry in magnitude between the warm and cold events (i. e., <b>El</b> <b>Niños</b> are stronger than La Niñas) and between {{the two types of}} El Niños: that is, cold tongue (CT) <b>El</b> <b>Niños</b> are stronger than warm pool (WP) <b>El</b> <b>Niños.</b> However, most models fail to reproduce the asymmetry between the two types of La Niñas, with CT stronger thanWPevents, which is opposite to observations. Most mod els capture the observed peak in ENSO amplitude around December; however, the seasonal evolution of ENSO has a large range of behavior across the models. The CMIP 5 models generally reproduce the duration of CT <b>El</b> <b>Niños</b> but have biases {{in the evolution of the}} other types of events. The evolution of WP <b>El</b> <b>Niños</b> suggests that the decay of this event occurs through heat content discharge in the models rather than the advection of SST via anomalous zonal currents, as seems to occur in observations. No consistent changes are seen across the models in the location and magnitude of maximum SST anomalies, frequency, or temporal evolution of these events in a warmer world. © 2014 American Meteorological Society...|$|R

50|$|During the 1980s {{there were}} three major Southern Oscillation episodes; two <b>El</b> <b>Niño's</b> (1982-83 and 1986/87) when the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) was {{negative}} and one La Nina when the SOI was positive.|$|R

5|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form on {{the side}} of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator, then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving north and northeast into the main belt of the Westerlies. When the subtropical ridge shifts due to <b>El</b> <b>Niño,</b> so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks. Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience many fewer September–November tropical cyclone impacts during <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> and neutral years. During <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> years, the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130°E, which would favor the Japanese archipelago. During La Niña years, the formation of tropical cyclones, and the subtropical ridge position, shift westward across the western Pacific Ocean, which increases the landfall threat to China and greater intensity to Philippines. Those that form near the Marshall Islands find their way to Jeju Island, Korea.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} {{does suggest that}} the Southern Oscillation is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity, which vary by season and region, as well as whether the ENSO phase is that of <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> or La Niña.

5|$|Although Fausto headed {{generally}} northwest while {{a tropical}} cyclone, it curved west-northwest after degenerating into a remnant low. Passing several hundred {{miles north of}} Hawaii, deep convection began to re-develop as the remnants of Fausto interacted with a tropical upper tropospheric trough. By 1800 UTC on August28, the low had enough deep convection to be reclassified as a tropical depression while located roughly 635mi (1020km) north of Oahu. No further re-intensification occurred for almost 48 hours, and then Fausto became a tropical storm again at 1800 UTC September1. This regeneration at high latitude was attributed to a temperature anomaly with waters 3.4°F (2°C) above normal and a favorable upper-level atmospheric pattern. Although sea surface temperature anomalies are usually attributed {{to the development of}} an <b>El</b> <b>Niño,</b> the <b>El</b> <b>Niño</b> had no effect with atmospheric conditions. A mid-latitude cyclone approached Tropical Storm Fausto and caused the system to accelerate northward.
