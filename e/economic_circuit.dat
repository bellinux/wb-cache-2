40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{development}} of a housing scheme in rural Pakistan. In the so-called ‘backward’ district of Bhakkar, five entrepreneurs formed a partnership in 2004 to build the area’s first privately developed housing scheme. As housing schemes are associated with development in Pakistan, they saw themselves as providing services that the state was expected, but failed, to deliver. Departing from normative conceptions of the state, this case study demonstrates how state power functions in Pakistan. Though it is an entrepreneurial venture, the construction of the housing scheme is structured by a discourse of national development. Further, the project was made possible through the state’s integration of Bhakkar into global <b>economic</b> <b>circuits.</b> I argue that the Pakistani state’s power in this instance does not obtain from its felt presence in Bhakkar but rather from its assurance of access to various physical and digital networks through which it is reconfigured...|$|R

Following {{a period}} of diverse versions of Keynesian-led relative redistribution in developed market economies, the United States became the point actor for a radical reshuffiing of capitalism. Key to this reshuffiing was expulsion - of people, places, and traditional economies (see Sassen 2014). While this is a socio-economic condition it is a critical, but invisible, element of the current political crisis. Measuring economic growth to understand whether government policies are working, or measuring political participation in terms of voting, excludes growing portions of our political economy - people, specific types of firms and <b>economic</b> <b>circuits,</b> and spaces. The Keynesian period was one of mass production and mass construction of suburban space: this brought with it an economic logic that valued people as workers and consumers, though not necessarily as human beings. The logic guiding the current phase of advanced capitalism does not value people as workers or as (mass) consumers. Thus, {{in the last two}} decades there has been a sharp growth in the numbers of people that have been "expelled" from the economy in much of the world.

While the literature in markets has {{addressed the issue of}} uncertainty as a fundamental element underlying any commitment to action (Beckert, 1996, 2003), it has been more attentive to the various strategies of reducing uncertainty - i. e. the framing of interactions by rules or devices - than to the way people cope with ineluctable and unforeseen events in the daily making of markets. In this paper, we defend the idea that the day-to-day management of transactions leads to the emergence of what will call an <b>economic</b> <b>circuit.</b> We define an <b>economic</b> <b>circuit</b> as a socio-technical and spatialized chain which organizes on a regular and continuous basis the circulation of goods and payments between OEkinship (or at least familiar) partnerships (Zelizer, 2004).

40|$|During {{the last}} decade of the 20 th century, {{modeling}} the macro-economic evolutions and implicitly modeling the evolutions in the social insurance systems, including and especially the pension systems, gained a very strong “anchor”, which allowed and allows at present the realization of multiple evolution scenarios, with a pretty big probability of achievement. This anchor, or better said this anchor-variable is the “inflation rate”, usually calculated as the consumption price index, respectively as its percentage variation from one period of time to another. The last decades of the 20 th century and the first five years of the 21 st century were characterized by an extremely accelerated rhythm of innovation, as well as by an acceleration and a multiplication of capital flows, which practically led to the phenomenon known as “economy globalization” or simply as “globalization”, as it extended outside the economical sphere towards all the spheres and sectors of the social life. This process has been accelerated by the “transition from plan to market” of the economies from Central and Eastern Europe, as a consequence of the fall of the totalitarian communist system, which dominated this part of Europe half a century, and of the end of the era known as “the Cold War”. The economic globalization movement, together with the transition from plan to market as well as with China’s entering into the international <b>economic</b> <b>circuits,</b> grew enormously the investment possibilities and thus the possibilities of placing the capital accumulated in the western countries during the autarchy period which characterized the Cold War era. labor market, pension system, globalization...|$|R

Different from other historical regions, such as Catalonia or the Basque Country, run by conservative and nationalist parties, the Socialist party in Andalucia from the first moment linked political autonomy and regional economic development. Underdeveloped, marginal from main national and international <b>economic</b> <b>circuits,</b> and run by a socialist regional government that wanted to repair the comparative wrongs suffered historically by the region, Andalucia enjoyed at the beginning of the 1980 's optimal conditions for implementing a self-reliant strategy of regional development. In order to identify, interpret, and analyse the evolution of the strategy of development of the Junta de Andalucia during the 1984 - 90 period, the thesis reviews policy and resource allocation in three policy-sectors: road, railway, and industrial promotion. In each case, a genuine self-reliant philosophy appears at the beginning of the period, which is, however, abandoned in the middle 1980 's and substituted by a development strategy based on functional integration into larger-scale systems. Using policy documents and interviews with decision-makers and researchers, the thesis attempts to explain the observed shift and to interpret the logic of the regional development strategies pursued by the Junta de Andalucia during its first decade. Political legitimation, during the period of economic recession, and economic accumulation, when pressures to support the internationalization process of capital appeared, guided regional planning policy of the Junta during its first decade.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} a growing international discourse and related rise of conservation paradigms that suggest {{the only way}} to make conservation work is to fully incorporate it into <b>economic</b> <b>circuits.</b> The development of a suite of market friendly conservation techniques have been at the forefront of this neoliberal turn in conservation practice, leading to the need for a deeper theorization and understanding of the role that non-extractive uses of nature are playing in relation to contemporary capitalism, and the political implications of these new approaches to conservation. The dissertation explores this global phenomenon through a case study of terrestrial conservation offsets in response to the ecological consequences of oil sands development in Alberta, Canada. The chapters that follow query the social, political and economic processes leading to the development of this particular conservation tool, and the political implications of project implementation in the province, particularly in regard to shifting accesses to land and resources. The findings complicate a number of dominant narratives to be found in the existing literature on market-based conservation practices, particularly in regard to the privatization of governance and their ability to facilitate recursive rounds of enclosure and accumulation. The case study draws attention to a series of contradictions and hybridizations that suggest that market-oriented conservation tools are associated with a more fractured and partial political project than often presented in the critical literature. The implications of the study suggest a need to shift focus from concerns about the use of market-friendly instruments in and of themselves, to the broader social and political context in which any given market is embedded. Doing so may serve to strip the neoliberal project of its assumed power, and open opportunities for novel and unanticipated re-imaginings of human-environment relations...|$|R

This kind of cortical organization, termed canonical circuit, has been functionally demonstrated primarily by studies involving visual striate cortex, and then, the concept has been extended to different cortical areas. In brief, the canonical circuit is composed of superficial pyramidal neurons of layers II/III receiving different inputs and deep pyramidal neurons of layer V that are responsible for cortex output. Superficial and deep pyramidal neurons are reciprocally connected, and inhibitory interneurons participate in modulating the activity of the circuit. The main intuition of this model is that the entire cortical network could be modeled as the repetition of relatively simple modules composed of relatively few types of excitatory and inhibitory, highly interconnected neurons. We will review the origin and the application of the canonical cortical circuit model in the six sections of this paper. The first section (The origins of the concept of canonical circuit: the cat visual cortex) reviews the experiments performed in the cat visual cortex, from the origin of the concept of canonical circuit to the most recent developments in the modelization of cortex. The second (The canonical circuit in neocortex) and third (Toward a canonical circuit in agranular cortex) sections try to extend the concept of canonical circuit to other cortical areas, providing some significant examples of circuit functioning in different cytoarchitectonic contexts. The fourth section (Extending the concept of canonical <b>circuit</b> to <b>economic</b> decisions <b>circuits)</b> reviews the experiments conducted in humans by using transcranial magnetic stimulation to demonstrate the validity of the canonical cortical circuit model. The fifth section (Extending the concept of canonical <b>circuit</b> to <b>economic</b> decisions <b>circuits)</b> explores the hypothesis that also complex human behaviors such as economic decision-making could also be explained in terms of canonical cortical circuit. The final section (Conclusion) provides a critical point of view, evidencing the limits of the available data and tracking directions for future research.

The Itakpe iron ore processing plant presently produces a taiing material containing up to 22 % iron minerals mostly fines produced inevitably during comminution. This article analyzed the existing circuit and ore properties, and presents specific comminution tests that were undertaken in order to recommend an alternate and more effective circuit.

The results show that fines exist in the circuit {{as a result of the}} brittleness of some portions of the ore which leads to crumbling and sloughing of the material during crushing and handling. It is revealed that mechanical stacking and reclamation also contributes to the generation of fines in the circuit. One possibility to a solution is to screen the product of secondary crusher ahead of grinding with a + 2 mm coarse screen between the reclaimer and the primary autogenous mills to prevent further production of fines during crushing unless the downstream recovery process is entirely designed for flotation. This option however still allows much fine material to the concentration lines. It is therefore recommended that materials less than 2 mm be screened off th...|$|R
