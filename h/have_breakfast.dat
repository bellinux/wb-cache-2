5|$|Bipartite verbal {{compounds}} such {{as these}} are not peculiar to any language in particular. They are in fact very common, and may even occur in every language, albeit with varying frequency. English {{has a number of}} complex predicates, include go sightseeing, <b>have</b> <b>breakfast</b> and take (a) bath. The event described by go sightseeing is unable to be described using a single verb sightsee; inflections like sightsaw and sightseen are ungrammatical. An event like take (a) bath, however, may be described by a single verb bathe, but it arguably has a slightly different meaning. Take (a) bath, in any case, is far more common.|$|E
5|$|Daily {{routine of}} life in the {{trenches}} began with the morning 'stand-to'. An hour before dawn everyone was roused and ordered to man their positions to guard against a dawn raid by the Germans. With stand-to over, {{it was time for the}} men to <b>have</b> <b>breakfast</b> and perform ablutions. Once complete, the NCOs would assign daily chores, before the men attended to the cleaning of rifles and equipment, filling sandbags, repairing trenches or digging latrines. Once the daily tasks had been completed the men who were off-duty would find a place to sleep. Due to the constant bombardments and the sheer effort of trying to stay alive, sleep deprivation was common. Soldiers also had to take it in turns to be on sentry duty, watching for enemy movements.|$|E

Most days ended with some entertainment, with the crew watching {{all or part of}} a movie; this was thought to be good for crew bonding as well as their psychological well-being.

500|$|According to Paul Kengor, {{author of}} God and Ronald Reagan, Reagan had a {{particularly}} strong {{faith in the}} goodness of people; this faith stemmed from the optimistic faith {{of his mother and}} the Disciples of Christ faith, into which he was baptized in 1922. For the time, Reagan's opposition to racial discrimination was unusual. He recalled the time in Dixon when the proprietor of a local inn would not allow black people to stay there, and he brought them back to his house. His mother invited them to stay overnight and <b>have</b> <b>breakfast</b> the next morning. After the closure of the Pitney Store in late 1920 and the family's move to Dixon, the midwestern [...] "small universe" [...] had a lasting impression on Reagan.|$|E
500|$|At the {{orientation}} meeting, Dwight and Jim find that Todd Packer (David Koechner) {{is still working}} at the company after {{the two of them}} attempted to get him fired. The president of Sabre's special projects, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) begins to talk about the project, which encompasses creating a store to rival Apple's chain of stores, and Dwight and Packer start to compete to see who will become her vice president. However, Dwight begins having stomach pains, which Ryan suspects to be appendicitis. Dwight collapses during a presentation, the paramedics confirm appendicitis, and Dwight is rushed into surgery. However, three hours later, after getting his appendix removed, he returns in order to impress his new boss. After nearly butchering a slide-show presentation, he finally impresses Bertram by telling the audience that the only element of marketing that matters is [...] "desire." [...] Bertram subsequently invites Packer and Dwight to <b>have</b> <b>breakfast</b> with her the following day.|$|E
500|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, John, having just chewed {{his way out of}} a dog carrier, meets Apu, who exclaims [...] "Elton John!", to which John replies [...] "That's my name! Well, not really." [...] The {{exchange}} references John's name change, as his birth name was Reginald Dwight. At the end of the episode, John performs for Apu and Manjula {{on the roof of the}} Kwik-E-Mart. The scene is a callback to the season 7 episode [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian", in which Paul McCartney performed on the roof. The scene in which Homer is seen jamming Valentine's Day cards into their holders were based on an observation by the writers. Simpsons writer George Meyer said of the scene: [...] "You just see cards get really man-handled, and the envelopes get switched with the wrong sizes." [...] In another scene, Marge and Manjula are seen playing badminton. While the scene was conceived in order to provide exposition, the sport was included because badminton is [...] "very popular" [...] in India, according to Simpsons writer Ian Maxtone-Graham. The episode also mentions the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's. In a scene, Apu, carrying a shopping bag, exits the jewellery and silverware store Tiffany & Co. Meanwhile, Homer, along with Chief Wiggum, Moe, Flanders and Dr Hibbert are watching Apu, assuming he bought jewellery for Manjula. It is soon revealed that Apu bought a croissant in the store, to which Wiggum says [...] "Oh, that's right, they <b>have</b> <b>breakfast</b> at Tiffany's now." [...] The heart-shaped fade out at the end of the episode is a reference to the series Love, American Style.|$|E

2500|$|Edison {{was said}} to have been {{influenced}} by a popular fad diet in his last few years; [...] "the only liquid he consumed was a pint of milk every three hours". He is reported to have believed this diet would restore his health. However, this tale is doubtful. In 1930, the year before Edison died, Mina said in an interview about him, [...] "correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies." [...] She also said that during one of his periodic [...] "great scientific adventures", Edison would be up at 7:00, <b>have</b> <b>breakfast</b> at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or dinner, implying that he continued to have all three.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kampusch's {{official}} statement after her escape, she and Přiklopil {{would get up}} early each morning to <b>have</b> <b>breakfast</b> together. Přiklopil gave her books, so she educated herself. Later, when explaining that in general she did not feel she had missed anything during her imprisonment, she noted, [...] "I spared myself many things, I did not start smoking or drinking and I did not hang out in bad company". But she also said: [...] "I always had the thought: surely I didn't come into the world so I could be locked up and my life completely ruined. I give up in despair about this unfairness. I always felt like a poor chicken in a hen house. You saw my dungeon {{on television and in}} the media. Thus you know how small it was. It was a place to despair." [...] She was given a television and radio to pass the time with, although she was initially only allowed to watch taped programmes and listen to foreign radio stations so she would not be aware of the publicised search for her. At one point, she tried to escape by jumping out of a car.|$|E

2500|$|The raid {{began on}} April 12, 1862, when the regular morning {{northbound}} passenger train from Atlanta, with the locomotive General made its fuel, water, and meal stop at Big Shanty, Georgia (now Kennesaw), on its regular run to Chattanooga. [...] The locomotive would be fully serviced {{to prepare for}} the steep grade further north. [...] This time allowed for the passengers and crew to <b>have</b> <b>breakfast</b> at the Lacy Hotel. There Andrews and his raiders hijacked the General and the train's first car. Their plan was to take the train north towards Chattanooga, stopping to damage or destroy track, bridges, telegraph wires, and track switches behind them, so as to prevent the Confederate Army from being able to move troops and supplies from Atlanta to Chattanooga. [...] The raiders planned to cross through the Federal siege lines on the outskirts of Chattanooga and rejoin Mitchel's army. They chose to capture the train at Big Shanty station because it had no telegraph office. [...] They steamed out of Big Shanty, leaving behind startled passengers, crew members, and onlookers, which included a number of Confederate soldiers from Camp McDonald, directly opposite the Lacy Hotel.|$|E
