5|$|Between his two matches against Janowski, Lasker {{arranged}} another World Chess Championship in January–February 1910 against Carl Schlechter. Schlechter was {{a modest}} gentleman, who was generally unlikely {{to win the}} major chess tournaments by his peaceful inclination, his lack of aggressiveness and his willingness to accept most draw offers from his opponents (about 80% of his games finished by a draw). The conditions of the match against Lasker are still debated among chess historians, but it seems Schlechter accepted to play under very unfavourable conditions, notably that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> finish two points ahead of Lasker to be declared {{the winner of the}} match, and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> win a revenge match to be declared World Champion. The match was originally meant to consist of 30 games, but when it became obvious that there were insufficient funds (Lasker demanded a fee of 1,000 marks per game played), the number of games was reduced to ten, making the margin of two points all the more difficult.|$|E
5|$|In December, City manager Stuart Pearce {{publicly}} {{stated that}} Samaras {{would have to}} 'toughen up', {{if he wanted to}} be a success in the Premier League. He said that Samaras' all round game wasn't good enough, and that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> learn to pass the ball better and compete more effectively. Some fans had criticised Pearce for signing Samaras, along with other foreign players, who had not settled in well enough to the English game. On 2 January, Samaras came on as a half-time substitute, and scored twice, as they beat Everton 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Three {{divisions}} {{were established}} within the new council: Finance and General Purposes; Public Health, Buildings and Sewerage; and Highways. The council sought {{to save money}} from the outset; {{reducing the number of}} workmen employed on the highways from ten to seven and cancelling the cleaning of ditches beside the roads. The lowest-paid man working on the sewers was informed <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> move within the district and take a pay cut from £1:6s to £1:3s or be made redundant. He accepted.|$|E

50|$|A {{thorough}} {{search of}} the two rooms in his parents' house where Fuchs had lived revealed more IEDs but no traces of the equipment which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> produce and handle the unstable explosives (including mercury fulminate and nitroglycerol) contained in his IEDs.|$|R
5|$|Aside {{from the}} attack on Ancona, the Austro-Hungarian battleships were {{confined}} to Pola {{for the duration of}} the war. Their operations were limited by Admiral Anton Haus, the commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, who believed that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> husband his ships to counter any Italian attempt to seize the Dalmatian coast. Since coal was diverted to the newer Tegetthoff-class battleships, the remainder of the war saw Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand and the rest of the Austro-Hungarian Navy acting as a fleet in being. This resulted in the Allied blockade of the Otranto Strait. With his fleet blockaded in the Adriatic Sea, and with a shortage of coal, Haus enacted a strategy based on mines and submarines designed to reduce the numerical superiority of the Allied navies.|$|E
5|$|Soul Reaver 2 {{is set in}} Nosgoth, {{a fictional}} land with fantasy aspects. In the first game in the series, , the vampire Kain embarks on a journey to restore the Pillars of Nosgoth—nine supernatural edifices which are {{inextricably}} tied {{to the health of}} the land, but become corrupted. During his adventure, Moebius, a manipulative sorcerer, tricks Kain into orchestrating the destruction of the vampire race: Kain is left the last surviving vampire in Nosgoth. After restoring eight of the Pillars, Kain discovers that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice his own life to restore the final corrupt one. Realizing that his death would ensure the annihilation of his species, he refuses to kill himself. This triggers the Pillars' collapse, and dooms the world to eternal decay, but enables Kain to live on and revive the vampire race.|$|E
5|$|Urlacher {{was born}} to Bradley and Lavoyda Urlacher in Pasco, Washington, and his parents raised him with his younger brother Casey. After his parents separated, Lavoyda raised Urlacher and his {{siblings}} in Lovington, New Mexico. He spent his youth immersed in sports, and developed an interest in football, basketball, track and later table tennis; he graduated from Lovington High School in 1996. While his mother worked several jobs to keep her family afloat, Urlacher spent his teenage years playing sports for Lovington High School and training in weight rooms. The training helped Urlacher gain the speed, stamina, and strength <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> solidify his football career.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, in its book Le guide des échecs the chess author Nicolas Giffard does not express the {{slightest}} {{doubt that this}} was a chess championship, but points out that in case Schlechter won, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> still <b>need</b> <b>to</b> win a revenge match before being called the World Champion.|$|R
5|$|Keeping up {{the longstanding}} {{tradition}} of Massachusetts Bay, Phips {{fought against the}} office of custom inspectors, arguing that the port of Massachusetts did not see enough enumerated goods to warrant their presence. Instead Phips attempted to re-establish a naval office, with himself acting {{as head of the}} admiralty, thereby doling out favors to gain the support of the powerful merchant class. This was part of an old turf battle between the Admiralty and Customs but it led to an altercation with Randolph's custom inspector, Jahleel Brenton, which seemed to follow the similar embarrassing and unseemly pattern as his altercation with Captain Short. The two altercations weighed together against Phips. Phips was accused of violating the Navigation Acts, as his predecessor had been. Blathwayt was slowly and steadily working to standardize the flow of tributes from the colonies to the Crown, and if Phips was clogging these pipes <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> answer for it.|$|E
25|$|Phan {{spent the}} first five years of the 20th century living in Huế and {{traveling}} the country. Phan drew up a three-step plan to get the French out of Vietnam. First, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> organize remnants of the Cần Vương movement and other sympathizers of the cause. Second, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> attain support from the Vietnamese imperial family and the bureaucracy, many of whom had already come to grips with French colonial rule. Finally, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> obtain foreign aid, from Chinese or Japanese revolutionaries, to finance the revolution.|$|E
25|$|After his 2014 season, {{there was}} much {{speculation}} by sports media and fans that Tanaka should have undergone surgery rather than follow his doctors' suggestions and rehab the injury. This was mostly due {{to the belief that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> get the surgery despite the rehab program.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas was {{reportedly}} told by doctors that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> 6 <b>to</b> 12 months to recuperate, however, {{he returned to}} work on September 14, 1970 - five weeks after the shooting. He claimed that his recovery was hastened by [...] "vigorous exercise {{and the fear of}} boredom". The wheelchair-bound district attorney was reported to avoid photographers and refuse interviews.|$|R
50|$|However, {{according}} to Daniel H. Ludlow, {{it is not}} clarified in the Book of Mormon whether Moroni made his abridgment of the record of Ether from Mosiah's earlier translation or whether Moroni took his account directly from the plates of Ether—in which case <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> translate the record as well as abridge it.|$|R

25|$|Chelmsford {{realised}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> {{account to}} the government and to history for the disaster. He quickly fixed blame on Durnford, claiming Durnford disobeyed his orders to fix a proper defensive camp, although there is no evidence such an order was issued and there would hardly have been time for Durnford to entrench. Further, it had been Chelmsford's decision not to entrench the camp, as {{it was meant to be}} temporary.|$|E
25|$|In 1738 Johnson {{composed}} London, {{his first}} imitation of Juvenal's poetry, because imitations were popularised by those like Pope during the 18th century. When Johnson replaced Edward Cave with Robert Dodsley as his publisher, {{he agreed with}} Dodsley that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> change the focus of his poetry. Johnson's London is concerned primarily with political issues, especially those surrounding the Walpole administration, but The Vanity of Human Wishes focuses on overarching philosophical concepts.|$|E

Charles expresses that he wants to take photos of the California lighthouses, but that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> someone <b>to</b> drive him, on account of his {{physical}} disability. Vickie then offers to drive Charles around so that he could take pictures of the different lighthouses for his contest.|$|R
50|$|On 9 January 1944 Abelia {{encountered}} a U-Boat while on convoy escort duty, {{and moved to}} attack with depth charges. Lieutenant Stuart ordered an increase in speed at 950 yards to prevent being torpedoed, not knowing that the U-boat was equipped with T5 torpedoes, for which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> increase speed at 700 yards. Abelia was hit and lost her rudder, and the U-boat escaped.|$|R

25|$|Reportedly, eBay {{was simply}} a side hobby for Omidyar until his Internet service {{provider}} informed him <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> upgrade to a business account due to the high volume of traffic to his website. The resulting price increase (from $30/month to $250) forced him to start charging those who used eBay, and was not met with any animosity. It resulted in the hiring of Chris Agarpao as eBay's first additional employee to handle the number of checks coming in for fees.|$|E

He was later sentenced to a consecutive term of 25 years to life by an Orange County court judge for the abduction and murder of James Macabe.

25|$|Knievel {{realized}} {{that to make}} any amount of real money <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> hire more performers, stunt coordinators and other personnel {{so that he could}} concentrate on the jumps. With little money, he went looking for a sponsor and found one in Bob Blair, owner of ZDS Motors, Inc., the West coast distributor for Berliner Motor Corporation, a distributor for Norton Motorcycles. Blair offered to provide the needed motorcycles, but he wanted the name changed from the Bobby Knievel and His Motorcycle Daredevils Thrill Show to Evil Knievel and His Motorcycle Daredevils. Knievel didn't want his image to be that of a Hells Angels rider, so he convinced Blair to allow him to use Evel instead of Evil.|$|E
25|$|The next {{election}} of a Polish king had occurred in 1386, with the selection of Władysław II Jagiełło (Jogaila), Grand Duke of Lithuania, as the first king of Poland's second dynasty. The electors chose Władysław II Jagiełło as king, and he married a daughter of Louis I, Jadwiga of Poland, but had no promise that his dynasty would continue on the throne. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> issue more privileges to the nobility to secure the guarantee that upon his death, {{one of his sons}} would inherit. The royal council chose the candidates, and the delegates of nobility and towns confirmed them during the sejm. The principle of election continued in effect throughout the nearly two centuries of the Jagiellon Dynasty, but just as in Piast times, it actually amounted to mere confirmation of the incoming heir.|$|E
25|$|Caesar was {{acclaimed}} Imperator in 60 and 45 BC. In the Roman Republic, {{this was}} an honorary title assumed by certain military commanders. After an especially great victory, army {{troops in the field}} would proclaim their commander imperator, an acclamation necessary for a general to apply to the Senate for a triumph. However, he also wanted to stand for consul, the most senior magistracy in the republic. If he were to celebrate a triumph, he would have to remain a soldier and stay outside the city until the ceremony, but to stand for election <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> lay down his command and enter Rome as a private citizen. He could not do both in the time available. He asked the senate for permission to stand in absentia, but Cato blocked the proposal.
