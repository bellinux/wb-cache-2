5|$|Telopea speciosissima {{is one of}} five {{species from}} southeastern Australia which make up the genus Telopea. Its closest {{relative}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> similar Gibraltar Range waratah (T.aspera) from northern New South Wales, which was only recognised as a separate species in 1995, having previously been considered an unusual northern population of T.speciosissima.|$|E

5|$|The {{courtship}} between Ferdinand and Miranda {{is one of}} {{the chief}} beauties of this play. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> purity of love.

5|$|Common to all {{crimes against}} {{the person is}} the {{infringement}} {{of the right to}} bodily integrity. It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no physical harm actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the right to liberty. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> touching, and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related to the right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The central statute on this topic is Offences against the Person Act 1861, which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and the threat of violence. Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.|$|E
5|$|Did Harrison {{deliberately}} use {{the music}} of He's So Fine? I do not believe he did so deliberately. Nevertheless, {{it is clear that}} My Sweet Lord <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> same song as He's So Fine with different words, and Harrison had access to He's So Fine. This is, under the law, infringement of copyright, and is no less so even though subconsciously accomplished.|$|E

5|$|Even {{more similar}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> rare Lactarius semisanguifluus. Its milk also discolours within 5 to 8minutes to maroon. The cap of older fruit bodies is nearly {{completely}} greenish. It is also common under pines. The most similar {{and also the}} most closely related fungus is Lactarius fennoscandicus, a boreal to subalpine species. Its cap is distinctly zoned and brown-orange. Sometimes the cap has purple-grey tones. The stem is pale to blunt orange-ochre.|$|E
5|$|In addition, other {{characters}} have supporting roles {{in this game}} as well. Lakitu reprises {{his role as the}} referee, helping racers in various situations such as announcing laps, giving the signal to drive with its traffic lights hanging on a fishing pole, and taking characters back on track in case they fall off course. Other supporting characters appearing in this game include Shy Guys, Goombas, Nokis, Toadsworth, Piantas, Chain Chomps, Piranha Plants and more. It {{should also be noted that}} this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> first time that Toadette has appeared in the Mario franchise.|$|E

5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E
5|$|The main {{disadvantage}} to {{die casting}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> high capital cost. Both the casting equipment required and the dies and related components are very costly, {{as compared to}} most other casting processes. Therefore, to make die casting an economic process, a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages are that the process is limited to high-fluidity metals, and casting weights must be between 30grams (1oz) and 10kg (20lb). In the standard die casting process the final casting will have {{a small amount of}} porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface. Thus a related disadvantage of die casting is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable. Parts needing hardening (through hardening or case hardening) and tempering are not cast in dies.|$|E
