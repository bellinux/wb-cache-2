500|$|The {{limitations}} of devising the album's musical direction {{on a tour}} bus forced Reznor to work differently from usual. Reznor said, [...] "I didn't have guitars around {{because it was too}} much hassle... It was another creative limitation... If I were <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>studio,</b> I would have done things the way I normally do them. But not having the ability to do that forced me into trying some things that were fun to do." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{misconception}} circulated at {{the time}} that the painting had been inspired by Swinburne's poem. In a letter to a newspaper, Whistler refuted this, while still showing his respect for Swinburne's work; [...] "those lines" [...] he wrote [...] "were only written, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>studio,</b> after the picture was painted. And the writing of them was a rare and graceful tribute from the poet to the painter – a noble recognition of work by the production of a nobler one." [...] Swinburne repaid the compliment: [...] "...whatever merit my song may have, it is not so complete in beauty, in tenderness and significance, in exquisite execution and delicate strength, as Whistler's picture..." ...|$|E

In response, Anka told the New York Times, that [...] "This Is It" [...] was [...] "exactly the same song" [...] as [...] "I Never Heard" [...] and only the titles were different. He also stated that he was planning on taking legal action against Jackson's estate. Soon afterwards, Jackson's estate acknowledged that Anka was a co-writer on the song and agreed that Anka would receive 50 percent of the publishing rights from it. Anka said the estate [...] "did the right thing," [...] and that he felt that he did not think [...] "that anybody tried to do the wrong thing [...] " [...] and it was [...] "an honest mistake." [...] Anka further stated [...] "They realize it's a mistake, they realize it's my song, they realize it's my production of his vocal <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>studio</b> and I am getting 50 percent of the whole project, actually, which is fair." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 1863 was {{to alter}} the course of Alma-Tadema's {{personal}} and professional life: on 3 January his invalid mother died, and on 24 September he was married, in Antwerp City Hall, to Marie-Pauline Gressin Dumoulin, the daughter of Eugène Gressin Dumoulin, a French journalist living near Brussels. Nothing is known of their meeting and little of Pauline herself, as Alma-Tadema never spoke about her after her death in 1869. Her image appears {{in a number of}} oils, though he painted her portrait only three times, the most notable appearing <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>studio</b> (1867). The couple had three children. Their eldest and only son lived only a few months dying of smallpox. Their two daughters, Laurence (1864–1940) and Anna (1867–1943), both had artistic leanings: the former in literature, the latter in art. Neither would marry.|$|E

But I know the music we recorded together during the last weeks of his life had to be released to honor him. So after his funeral, I locked myself <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>studio</b> and turned the songs we had recorded into the best and last Ministry record anyone will ever hear. I can't do it without Mikey and I don't want to. So yes, this will be Ministry's last album." [...] The album, titled From Beer to Eternity, was released on September 6, 2013. Jourgensen stated that Ministry would tour in support of From Beer to Eternity, but would not record any more albums. In an April 2016 interview with Loudwire, however, Jourgensen mentioned the possibility of making another Ministry album [...] "if the circumstances are right." ...|$|E

Let me try to tell you what that barbarian wants. He had it all planned out and even a sketch made of his idea. The old boy doesn't draw badly at all. But, ye goddesses of Art! listen to the monstrosity he expects me to paint. He wants himself in the centre of the canvas, of course. He is to be painted as Jupiter sitting on Olympus, with the clouds at his feet. At one side of him stands George Washington, in full regimentals, with his hand on the president's shoulder. An angel with outstretched wings hovers overhead, and is placing a laurel wreath on the president's head, crowning him--Queen of the May, I suppose. In the background is to be cannon, more angels and soldiers.

Though the songs were, essentially finished, Campbell travelled to Keyclub Recording Co, an analogue recording studio in an industrial region in Michigan, for some finishing touches.
