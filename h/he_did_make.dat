5|$|Roy of the Rovers Annuals were {{produced}} {{every year from}} 1958 until 1994, and again in 2000. A number of tie-in books were also published, including a handful of paperback prose storybooks in 1977 and 1993, and two football quiz books in 1978 and 1979. Roy of the Rovers never made the leap from page to screen, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>make</b> an appearance on the BBC comedy sports quiz They Think It's All Over in 1999, {{in the form of}} a cardboard cut-out. on 10 October 2006.|$|E
5|$|Gromek {{entered the}} 1948 Cleveland Indians season {{fighting}} for {{a spot on the}} pitching staff after spending the offseason recovering from a knee injury, which had bothered the season prior, and while <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>make</b> the roster, he remained solely a relief pitcher to start the season. He made one start as a replacement for Don Black on June 6 against the Athletics, and won the game 11–1 in a complete game effort. Boudreau considered moving him into the starting rotation, but instead considered it a one-time appearance due to Black's injury, and he remained in a relief role though mid-July. After a second complete game victory against the Athletics on July 15, Gromek was moved to a part-time starter role, where he remained the rest of the season.|$|E
5|$|Pettibone methodically progressed {{through the}} Phillies' farm system, {{generally}} spending about one season {{at each level}} until 2012, when he advanced to the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs after spending {{a majority of the}} season with the Double-A Reading Fightin Phils. Early in 2013, the Phillies promoted him to the major league club, and he made 18 starts with the Phillies before inflaming his rotator cuff, for which the Phillies precautionarily did not use him {{for the remainder of the}} season. He began the 2014 season competing for a spot in the back of the Phillies starting rotation, and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>make</b> two starts, but was ineffective, and was sent back to the minor leagues, where he sustained a SLAP tear, and was placed on the disabled list.|$|E
50|$|Kyle Craig's role {{is small}} in the novel, but <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>make</b> a few {{appearances}} throughout the book.|$|R
5000|$|While Skolem {{is mainly}} {{addressing}} {{a problem with}} Zermelo's set theory, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>make</b> this observation about the axiom of reducibility: ...|$|R
50|$|Sean McCann as the blacksmith. Though {{rarely seen}} in the series, when <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>make</b> an appearance, the episode {{typically}} centers around his character.|$|R
5|$|During the 2012–13 season, Palace {{achieved}} {{promotion to}} the Premier League via the Championship play-offs after finishing fifth.O'Keefe featured just {{five times in}} the league during the season although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>make</b> two appearances during the play-offs, replacing Wilfried Zaha as a late substitute during the second leg of their semi-final victory over Brighton & Hove Albion, and then playing {{the majority of the}} 2013 Championship play-off Final after replacing Kagisho Dikgacoi due to injury after just 17 minutes as Palace claimed a 1–0 victory in extra-time to earn promotion. At the start of the club's Premier League campaign the following season, on 31 August 2013, O'Keefe sealed a 3–1 victory in Palace's first three points of their Premier League return in the 92nd minute at home to Sunderland with a curling 20 yard shot after coming on as a late substitute, the first senior goal of his career and what later turned out to be his only goal for Palace.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>make</b> a career-best 175 against Leicestershire in 1913, {{only to see}} Worcestershire fall to an eight-run defeat, despite Worcestershire having {{enforced}} the follow-on.|$|E
25|$|Winlaw was a {{right-handed}} batsman {{and occasional}} wicket-keeper, {{who played the}} majority of his cricket in minor counties cricket, though <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>make</b> one appearance in first-class cricket.|$|E
25|$|Tommy Anderson — Dennis' {{best friend}} (after Mr. Wilson). This {{character}} eventually {{disappeared from the}} strip, although <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>make</b> appearances in the Dennis the Menace Pocket Full of Fun books.|$|R
50|$|His boss {{appears in}} most advertisements, usually by {{telephone}} from his New York office. However <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>make</b> visits to New Zealand to meet Goldstein, and {{to check up on}} him.|$|R
50|$|Murphy {{was to be}} a {{producer}} for David Bowie's final studio album, Blackstar, but it reportedly fell through. However, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>make</b> a guest appearance on the album as a percussionist.|$|R
25|$|Titmus's batting {{gradually}} became less effective, and from 1969 onwards he passed fifty only six more times, though <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>make</b> an unbeaten 112 against Warwickshire {{as late as}} 1976. Until 1976 he took at least 57 first-class wickets in every year.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Croatian {{president}} Ivo Josipović said {{he would}} not attend the year's May Bleiburg commemoration as long as Ustaše iconography was present, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>make</b> a separate visit to the Bleiburg memorial in June in addition to his visit to the Tezno memorial.|$|E
25|$|Bright did {{not have}} a {{particularly}} successful season with the ball in 1980–81, obtaining 22 wickets at 40. However <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>make</b> a first class century, 108 against Tasmania. He also took 4–59 in the same game. He scored 70 in a McDonald's Cup game against WA.|$|E

25|$|While {{he rarely}} came into Paris, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>make</b> {{important}} {{additions to the}} city's landmarks. His first major building was the École Militaire, a new military school, on the Left Bank. Work began in 1753 and was completed in 1760, when the King first visited it. A chapel for the school was begun in 1768, and finished in 1773.|$|E
25|$|After that season, Lane {{played no}} more regular {{first-class}} cricket, though <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>make</b> a final, one-off, appearance for Worcestershire {{three years later}} versus Essex at Leyton. This {{was the scene of}} his heroics in 1929, but a repeat was not to be: Lane had a quiet match, scoring 3 and 18 and not bowling in a drawn game.|$|E
25|$|Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665) never {{published}} his writings; in particular, {{his work on}} number theory is contained almost entirely in letters to mathematicians and in private marginal notes. He wrote down nearly no proofs in number theory; he had no models in the area. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>make</b> repeated use of mathematical induction, introducing the method of infinite descent.|$|E
50|$|Robby {{has made}} few {{appearances}} after the 1970s, but <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>make</b> a cameo appearance in Gremlins (1984); {{he can be}} seen standing {{in the background and}} speaking some of his trademark lines. He was also featured in a 2006 commercial for AT&T.|$|R
50|$|Although Oscar {{no longer}} has his own show, he remains the mascot of the ITV {{regional}} service in the Channel Islands. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>make</b> occasional appearances both on TV & online and regularly makes updates on Twitter that have a strong element of absurdity.|$|R
6000|$|... 'When <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>make</b> {{his grand}} entry, we will {{decorate}} our balcony, and have our six windows packed with loyal Yankees who will hurrah their best for [...] "the honest man," [...] {{as they call}} Victor Emmanuel--and that is high praise for a king.' ...|$|R
25|$|By 1961 Spencer's {{days as a}} {{first-class}} player were drawing to a close, and he appeared only twice that season, although he continued to turn out regularly for the Second XI. After that season, however, he dropped out even of the second team, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>make</b> a very brief comeback at that level in 1968 when he played one match against Surrey seconds.|$|E
25|$|In 1972 he took 22 wickets, {{but after}} that his bowling was less to the fore. He {{was in and out}} of the side between 1972 and 1974, though <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>make</b> the {{occasional}} large score. In the first-class game, he made the first and larger of his two centuries, this being the 141 he hit against Oxford University, following it up with 80 in the second innings.|$|E
25|$|On July 29, 2006, Miller {{signed a}} one-day {{contract}} {{to play baseball}} for the Nashua Pride (Canadian-American League). He went 0–2 with two strikeouts, however <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>make</b> an acrobatic catch in left field, which earned national attention by being featured by ESPN, among others. The team said it would donate at least $5,000 from ticket sales for the game to Miller's Turtle Ridge Foundation, which will give {{the money to the}} Lance Armstrong Foundation.|$|E
50|$|At {{a dinner}} party, {{some of which}} is {{televised}} live (unbeknown to him), he reveals he has had some experience in the theater. <b>He's</b> approached to <b>do</b> TV commercials but does not like the idea. Later, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>make</b> a few commercials {{in order to get}} some money.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never thought {{one way or}} t'other," [...] he answered. [...] "Jethro {{never had}} much to do with the boys. He's always in that tannery, or out buyin' of hides. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>make</b> a sharp bargain when he buys a hide. We always goes shares on our'n." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>did</b> not <b>make</b> USA's final roster for the 2014 Paralympic Games.|$|R
25|$|Lamba had a {{moderate}} start {{at an average}} of 33.67 against the Sri Lankans, but failed in his only test against the West Indies, scoring just one run in two innings which virtually ended his career as a Test player. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>make</b> a come back to test cricket playing XI against Pakistan in 1989, but injured his finger during nets and couldn't play in the match and Mohammad Azharuddin was given a chance again.|$|E
25|$|After {{his school}} friend Brad Cain (Lodi) {{notified}} Siaki that the WCW Power Plant was holding tryouts in early 1999, Siaki attended the tryout and {{was awarded a}} WCW developmental contract. He graduated after seven months and wrestled his first televised match on WCW Saturday Night against Allan Funk. Siaki largely appeared on Saturday Night and faced other Power Plant graduates, though <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>make</b> several appearances on Thunder and Nitro. Siaki eventually left WCW, unhappy {{with the way he}} was being utilized.|$|E
25|$|Gilmour found things {{slightly}} tougher in {{the second}} test, taking 1–70 and 3–70 and making 3 with the bat in a drawn game. Gilmour was out-bowled in a Sheffield Shield game by Jeff Thomson and was made 12th man for the third test so the Australian selectors could trial other bowlers. However <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>make</b> the squad to tour NewZealand in 1974. He took first class 45 wickets at 31 for the summer – this would be Gilmour's best ever aggregate.|$|E
50|$|While Turtleheart signed, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not <b>make</b> a {{presentation}} at the Treaty.|$|R
50|$|The act {{opens with}} the Oxford senior {{graduates}} posing for their class picture - complete with caps and gowns. They are all there except for Charley. He promised that he'd be there.

50|$|Strauss has {{continued}} {{to be involved with}} pickup artistry through his dating coaching company Stylelife Academy, founded in 2007. Most of the coaching is done by employed coaches, rather than Strauss himself, though <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>make</b> appearances at yearly conferences and in some video products sold by the company.|$|R
