25|$|A study {{conducted}} by measuring the <b>intraoral</b> vapour levels over a 24-hour period in patients with at least nine amalgam restorations showed that the average daily dose of inhaled mercury vapour was 1.7 μg (range from 0.4 to 4.4 μg), which is approximately 1% of the threshold limit value of 300 to 500 μg/day established by the WHO, based on a maximum allowable environmental level of 50 μg/day in the workplace. Critics point out that: (1) the workplace safety standards are based on allowable maxima in the workplace, not mercury body burden; (2) the workplace safety numbers are not applicable to continuous 24-hour exposure, but are limited to a normal work day and a 40-hour workweek; and (3) the uptake/absorption numbers are averages and not worst-case patients (those most at risk).|$|E
500|$|Primary {{orofacial}} herpes {{is readily}} identified by clinical examination {{of persons with}} no previous history of lesions and contact with an individual with known HSV-1 infection. The appearance and distribution of sores in these individuals typically presents as multiple, round, superficial oral ulcers, accompanied by acute gingivitis. Adults with atypical presentation {{are more difficult to}} diagnose. Prodromal symptoms that occur before the appearance of herpetic lesions help differentiate HSV symptoms from the similar symptoms of other disorders, such as allergic stomatitis. [...] When lesions do not appear inside the mouth, primary orofacial herpes is sometimes mistaken for impetigo, a bacterial infection. Common mouth ulcers (aphthous ulcer) also resemble <b>intraoral</b> herpes, but do not present a vesicular stage.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Intraoral</b> {{halitosis}} – [...] possibly due {{to increased}} activity of halitogenic biofilm on the posterior dorsal tongue (although dysgeusia may cause a complaint of nongenuine halitosis {{in the absence of}} hyposalivation).|$|E
2500|$|Sugars from candies, soft drinks, {{and fruit}} juices play a {{significant}} role in tooth decay, and consequently in enamel destruction. The mouth contains a great number and variety of bacteria, and when sucrose, the most common of sugars, coats the surface of the mouth, some <b>intraoral</b> bacteria interact with it and form lactic acid, which decreases the pH in the mouth. [...] Then, the hydroxyapatite crystals of enamel demineralize, allowing for greater bacterial invasion deeper into the tooth. The most important bacterium involved with tooth decay is Streptococcus mutans, but the number and type of bacteria varies with the progress of tooth destruction.|$|E
2500|$|Saliva {{substitutes}} {{can improve}} xerostomia, but {{tend not to}} improve the other problems associated with salivary gland dysfunction. Parasympathomimitic drugs (saliva stimulants) such as pilocarpine may improve xerostomia symptoms and other problems associated with salivary gland dysfunction, but the evidence for treatment of radiation-induced xerostomia is limited. Both stimulants and substitutes relieve symptoms to some extent. [...] Salivary stimulants are probably only useful in people with some remaining detectable salivary function. A systematic review of the treatment of dry mouth found no strong {{evidence to suggest that}} a specific topical therapy is effective. The review reported limited evidence that oxygenated glycerol triester spray was more effective than electrolyte sprays. Sugar free chewing gum increases saliva production but there is no strong evidence that it improves symptoms. There is a suggestion that <b>intraoral</b> devices and integrated mouthcare systems may be effective in reducing symptoms, but {{there was a lack of}} strong evidence. A systematic review of the management of radiotherapy induced xerostomia with parasympathomimetic drugs found that there was limited evidence to support the use of pilocarpine in the treatment of radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction. It was suggested that, barring any contraindications, a trial of the drug be offered in the above group (at a dose of five mg three times per day to minimize side effects). Improvements can take up to twelve weeks. However, pilocarpine is not always successful in improving xerostomia symptoms. The review also concluded that there was little evidence to support the use of other parasympathomimetics in this group.|$|E
50|$|Incision and {{drainage}} of the abscess may be either <b>intraoral</b> or external. An <b>intraoral</b> incision {{and drainage}} procedure is indicated if the infection is localized to the sublingual space.
