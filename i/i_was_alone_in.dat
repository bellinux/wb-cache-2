2500|$|... "The Trap", a {{short story}} by H.P. Lovecraft and Henry S. Whitehead, centers around a mirror. [...] "It was on a certain Thursday morning in December {{that the whole thing}} began with that unaccountable motion I thought I saw in my antique Copenhagen mirror. Something, it seemed to me, stirred—something {{reflected}} in the glass, though <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> my quarters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eastwood was not {{initially}} {{pleased with the}} script and was concerned he might be upstaged by Wallach, and said to Leone, [...] "In the first film <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone.</b> <b>In</b> the second, we were two. Here we are three. If it goes on this way, in the next one I will be starring with the American cavalry". As Eastwood played hard-to-get in accepting the role (inflating his earnings up to $250,000, another Ferrari and 10% of the profits in the United States when eventually released there), Eastwood was again encountering publicist disputes between Ruth Marsh, who urged him to accept the third film of the trilogy, and the William Morris Agency and Irving Leonard, who were unhappy with Marsh's influence on the actor. Eastwood banished Marsh from having any further influence in his career and {{he was forced to}} sack her as his business manager via a letter sent by Frank Wells. For some time after, Eastwood's publicity was handled by Jerry Pam of Gutman and Pam. Throughout filming, Eastwood regularly socialized with actor Franco Nero, who was filming Texas, Adios at the time.|$|E

60|$|Dazed, I {{watched her}} open the bedroom doors, motion to Lindy to pass through, {{and then she}} had closed them again and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the darkened parlor.|$|E
60|$|I rose at last numbed and stiff. I looked again. The vision had departed. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> my cell, and {{the rain}} was falling {{steadily}} outside. I groaned despairingly. Then I swayed, reeled sideways and lost all consciousness.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the house, {{concealed}} {{now even}} from Mr Bowater's frigid stare. Yet at sight of these flowers a slight vertigo came over me, and I {{had to sit}} on my bed {{for a moment to}} recover myself.|$|E
6000|$|One day, {{some weeks}} {{after we left}} Scrymgeour's house-boat, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> my rooms, very busy smoking, when William John entered with a telegram.

6000|$|... "That {{is quite}} true," [...] I admitted, [...] "but I {{scarcely}} {{see that there}} was anything impertinent in that. Afterwards we spoke together for a little time. I told him that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> Paris and bored. It was because I was alone that we went out together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is lucky," [...] {{observed}} the girl, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the house; your General may hammer {{until he is}} weary, and there is none to open for him. Follow me!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "White Man," [...] whispered Hokosa {{throwing}} {{down the}} spear, [...] "how can these things be? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the hut with the prince, I was alone beneath the Tree of Doom, and you, as I know well, were beyond the river. Your spies must be good, White Man." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the burial-ground of our parish church.

6000|$|... "Yes, Master, {{that is the}} truth, or part of it. You {{saved my}} life, and {{sheltered}} me when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> a strange land, and for this and for yourself I came to love you very greatly, and love, if it be true, is always jealous and always hates a rival." ...|$|E

60|$|The ghastly {{light that}} I had seen already {{dawned on me}} once more. I {{was no longer in}} my bed, no longer in my room, no longer in the house.

60|$|I {{had sent}} Grooton {{to the village}} with letters, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the place.

But I knew her at once. It was Mrs. Smith-Lessing.|$|E
60|$|I {{returned}} to the inn at eight o'clock, purposely abstaining from waking Arthur, who was sleeping off the past night's excitement {{on one of my}} friend's sofas. A suspicion had occurred to me, as soon as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> my bedroom, which made me resolve that Holliday and the stranger whose life he had saved should not meet again, if I could prevent it.|$|E

60|$|There {{was a tall}} thin young man, {{whose face}} was red and {{inflamed}} from the sun. <b>I</b> thought he <b>was</b> a German tourist. He had just come in; and he was eating bread and milk.
