Burnout 3s soundtrack featured over forty songs, <b>delivered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> radio station format presented by DJ Stryker from alternative rock station KROQ-FM. Options were added to modify which songs during a race or on the menu screen and the Xbox version supports custom soundtracks.|$|E

Similarly a Copenhagen '96 scheme was pained for Copenhagen's term as the European Capital of Culture. Since 2002, SAS has painted selected aircraft in a Star Alliance livery.

5|$|Prior to Debra's {{arrival in}} Texas, {{numerous}} hurricane warnings were issued {{and at least}} 8,600individuals evacuated. Torrential rains were produced in southeastern Texas, which led to widespread flooding on highways. Sea vessels took {{the brunt of the}} storm, with many having become stranded or damaged. Forms of transportation such as air, rail, and road were significantly interrupted or even shut down. High winds from the storm caused expansive damage to buildings, windows, signs, and roofs. The hurricane resulted in 11injuries but no deaths, and approximately 90cattle drowned. Damage in Texas' Brazoria, Galveston, and Harris counties surmounted $6.685million, and total damage from the storm reached $7million. In the aftermath, the Weather Bureau was criticized for the lack of warning; the bureau's chief, Stephen Lichtblau, maintained that it was fortunate that any warnings were issued, and those that were had been <b>delivered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> timely manner.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the project}} was not without its trials. Edwards' initial plan to employ a team of writers was thwarted {{by a lack of}} {{resources}} and funds. He instead had to enlist historians based outside of the AWM for some of the volumes, who agreed to work on the history without financial compensation. The series also experienced problems with staff turnover. Aside from Pemberton, the unexpected death in 1998 of Ian McNeill—author of the volumes on the Australian Army—caused extensive delays to the series' completion. The first seven volumes (including McNeill's To Long Tan , dealing with army operations up to 1966), were <b>delivered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> timely fashion and published successively from 1992 to 1998. However, McNeill's next volume was only partway written when he died. His research assistant, Ashley Ekins, was eventually appointed to complete the series. On the Offensive was published in 2003, while the final volume, Fighting to the Finish, appeared in 2012; two decades after the first volume, and sixteen years after Edwards' position at the AWM had ended. Again following the path of Bean and Long, Edwards was then commissioned by the AWM to write a single volume summary of the series. Australia and the Vietnam War was published by NewSouth in 2014.|$|E

40|$|ACL (facteur d'impact) International audienceDelivery of very preterm {{babies in}} {{maternity}} units with on-site {{neonatal intensive care}} (level III units) is associated with lower mortality and morbidity. This analysis explores risk factors for not <b>delivering</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> level III unit, using data from a population-based study of very preterm births in Paris and surrounding districts in 2003. The sample for analysis included resident women with a fetus alive {{at the onset of}} labour between 24 and 31 weeks of gestation (n = 641). Characteristics of women <b>delivering</b> <b>in</b> and those not in level III units were compared using logistic regression. Further analysis was carried out for the subgroup of women not already scheduled to <b>deliver</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> level III unit. Twenty-nine per cent of women did not <b>deliver</b> <b>in</b> level III units; in the subgroup scheduled to <b>deliver</b> <b>in</b> level I or II units, 43 % were not transferred. Women were less likely to <b>deliver</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> level III unit if they had a singleton pregnancy, a gestation of < 26 weeks or at 31 weeks, experienced antenatal haemorrhaging, lived in socially deprived neighbourhoods or at a greater distance from the nearest level III. Women scheduled to <b>deliver</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> maternity unit with a special care nursery were also less likely to <b>deliver</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> level III unit. In contrast, preterm rupture of membranes and fetal growth restriction increased the likelihood of a level III delivery. These results underline the importance of controlling for clinical characteristics when analysing perinatal outcome by place of delivery and show how socioe-conomic factors, known to impact on the risk of having a preterm birth, can also affect access to appropriate care...|$|R

25|$|Counseling {{may be used}} by {{offenders}} {{to minimize}} the risk of future domestic violence.

Programme facilitators guide participants through a curriculum of adult-education style modules, which draw on a variety of therapeutic approaches, but predominantly cognitive behavioural therapy and psycho-education.

While some (ex-) partners of offenders have experienced improvements in their situation, others have not, and there also appears to be a risk of doing harm.|$|E

25|$|Structured {{cognitive}} behavioral training (SCBT) is a cognitive-based {{process with}} core philosophies that draw heavily from CBT. Like CBT, SCBT asserts that behavior is inextricably related to beliefs, thoughts and emotions. SCBT also builds on core CBT philosophy by incorporating other well-known modalities {{in the fields}} of behavioral health and psychology: most notably, Albert Ellis's Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. SCBT differs from CBT in two distinct ways. First, SCBT is <b>delivered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> highly regimented format. Second, SCBT is a predetermined and finite training process that becomes personalized by the input of the participant. SCBT is designed with the intention to bring a participant to a specific result in a specific period of time. SCBT has been used to challenge addictive behavior, particularly with substances such as tobacco, alcohol and food, and to manage diabetes and subdue stress and anxiety. SCBT has also been used in the field of criminal psychology in the effort to reduce recidivism.|$|E
