5|$|A {{review of}} olivaceous warbler records {{commenced}} in 1986, and {{continued through the}} 1990s. The results of this review were published in 1999: six of the previously accepted records were rejected as not meeting modern identification standards. In 2003, following the split of olivaceous warbler into two species, the accepted records were all reviewed again to ascertain {{which of the two}} they wereall nine proved to be eastern olivaceous warblers. Following the split of Bonelli's warbler into two species, the committee reviewed all the 121 accepted records, and concluded that 51 were western and two were eastern; for the remainder, not enough evidence was available to make a firm decision. The committee had previously stated that it would regard as western Bonelli's warbler all except proven eastern Bonelli's warblers, however, this announcement rescinded that decision. In 2003â€“04, all <b>desert</b> <b>warbler</b> records were reviewed, and it was concluded that all were referable to the newly split Asian <b>desert</b> <b>warbler,</b> rather than African <b>desert</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Asian <b>desert</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia nana) is {{a typical}} warbler which breeds in the deserts of central and western Asia and the extreme east of Europe (Volga Delta area east to western Inner Mongolia in China), and {{migrating}} to similar habitats in southwestern Asia (Arabia to northwestern India) and the far northeast of Africa (Red Sea coastal regions) in winter. Until recently it was considered conspecific with the African <b>desert</b> <b>warbler</b> (and called just [...] "desert warbler"), but is now given specific status. The two are still each other's closest living relatives, and their relationships to other typical warblers are not clear. They may be fairly close to the whitethroat; particularly, female whitethroats look much like a richly-coloured Asian <b>desert</b> <b>warbler.</b> But it seems that all these three taxa are fairly basal members of the genus.|$|E
50|$|The birds sighted less frequently, {{called the}} 'specialists' were ortolan bunting, <b>desert</b> <b>warbler,</b> pied tit, white-browed fantail, lesser spotted eagle, sirkeer malkoha, Eurasian wryneck and yellow-crowned woodpecker.|$|E

50|$|Birds of this {{ecoregion}} include wheatears (Oenanthe isabellina, O. deserti), <b>desert</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia nana), {{brown-necked raven}} (Corvus ruficollis), the endangered houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata), black-bellied sandgrouse (Pterocles orientalis), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), steppe eagle (Aquila rapax), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), and the saker falcon (Falco cherrug).|$|E
50|$|It {{is a small}} bird, {{marginally}} {{the smallest}} in the genus, 11-12 cm long, and 7-10 g weight. The sexes are almost identical in colour, pale sandy yellow-brown above and whitish below; the bill and legs are yellowish, and the eye has a yellow iris; it differs from the Asian <b>desert</b> <b>warbler</b> in its more yellowish overall colour.|$|E
50|$|The {{streaked}} {{scrub warbler}} is a small, skulking <b>desert</b> <b>warbler</b> which cocks its tail over its back. The adults are grey brown above, finely streaked with dark brown. They have a broad pale supercilium and a thin black eyestripe. The underparts are whitish with reddish flanks and vent, the breast is finely streaked. The tail is graduated and dark brown with a white tip. Juveniles are duller.|$|E

50|$|Halvad {{is close}} to the Indian Wild Ass Sanctuary at the Little Rann of Kutch. The Asiatic wild ass {{is a member of the}} horse family with {{striking}} white underparts and a deep mane. It is a strong and powerful runner. Other animals spotted here are nilgai and chinkara and the birds seen are the Indian sandgrouse, houbara bustard, lark, <b>desert</b> <b>warbler,</b> desert wheatear, Indian courser and vultures.|$|E
50|$|Like its relatives, it is insectivorous, {{but will}} also take small berries; unlike most warblers, it {{commonly}} feeds on the ground. The song is a distinctive jingle often given in an advertisement flight, with clear notes (differing from Asian <b>desert</b> <b>warbler</b> in having few harsh notes). It breeds in desert and semi-desert environments, as long as some scattered bushes for nesting occur. The nest is built in low shrub, and 2-5 eggs are laid.|$|E
50|$|It {{is a small}} bird (the second-smallest in {{the genus}} after African <b>desert</b> <b>warbler),</b> 11.5-12.5 cm long. The sexes are almost {{identical}} in colour, pale grey-brown above with browner wings and tail, and whitish below; the bill and legs are yellowish, and the eye has a yellow iris. Like its relatives, it is insectivorous, but will also take small berries; unlike most warblers, it commonly feeds on the ground. The song is a distinctive jingle often given in an advertisement flight, {{with a mix of}} clear and harsher notes. It breeds in semi-desert and dry steppe environments, as long as some bushes for nesting occur. The nest is built in low shrub, and 4-6 eggs are laid.|$|E
50|$|They are {{strongly}} built, with stouter legs {{and a slightly}} thicker bill than many other warblers, and {{range in size from}} 11 cm length and 7 g weight (African <b>desert</b> <b>warbler)</b> up to 17 cm length and 36 g weight (barred warbler). The plumage is in varying shades of grey and brown, usually darker above and paler below, with bluish or pinkish tones in several species; several also have orange-brown or rufous fringed wing feathers. The tail is square-ended in most, slightly rounded in a few, and in several species has white sides. Many of the species show some sexual dimorphism, with distinctive male and female plumages, with the males in many having black or bright grey on the heads, replaced by brown, brownish-grey or similar dusky colours in females; {{about a third of the}} species also have a conspicuous red eye ring in males. Species breeding in cool temperate regions {{are strongly}} migratory, while most of those in warmer regions are partially migratory or resident. They are active warblers usually associated with open woodland, scrub, hedges or shrubs. Their diet is largely insectivorous, though several species also eat fruit extensively, mainly small berries such as elder and ivy, particularly from late summer to late winter; one species (blackcap) also frequently takes a wide variety of human-provided foods on birdtables in winter.|$|E
