40|$|Medication {{errors are}} a {{significant}} global concern and can cause serious medical consequences in children. <b>Double</b> <b>checking</b> of medicines by two nurses is one strategy used by many children's hospitals to prevent errors from reaching paediatric patients. This thesis involves different studies that evaluated {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> process in reducing and preventing medication administration errors in a children's hospital. In addition, a systematic review was conducted of medication errors studies in the Middle East. A systematic review was also conducted of published studies of <b>double</b> <b>checking.</b> Six electronic databases were searched for articles that assessed the <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> process during the administration of medicines. Sixteen articles were identified. Only {{one of them was a}} randomised controlled clinical trial in a clinical setting. Only one study was conducted in a children's hospital. The review found that there is insufficient evidence to either support or refute the practice of <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> and more clinical trials are needed to evaluate the <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> process in children's hospitals. Based on the findings that were highlighted from the systematic review, a prospective observational study of paediatric nurses using the <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> process for medication administration was undertaken. The study aimed to evaluate how closely <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> policies are followed by nurses in different paediatric areas, and also to identify any. medication administration errors during the study period. 2, 000 drug dose administration events were observed. There was variation between paediatric nurses adherence to <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> steps and different medication administration errors were identified. Based on the observational study, a semi-structured questionnaire study was developed. It was designed to explore the paediatric nurses' knowledge and opinions about the <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> process. The study showed that many nurses have insufficient knowledge on the <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> process and the hospital policy for medication administration. A simulation study was conducted to examine whether single or <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> is more effective in detecting and reducing medication errors in children. Each participant in this study was required to prepare and administer medicines in scenarios for two "dummy patients" either with another nurse (<b>double</b> <b>checking)</b> or alone (single checking). Different confounders were built into each scenario (prescribing and administration) for nurses to identify and address during the administration process. Errors in drug preparation, administration and failure to address confounders were observed and documented. The main findings from this study were that the <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> process is more likely to identify medication administration errors and contraindicated drugs than single checking. The time taken for drug administration was similar for both processes. Another systematic review was conducted to identify the published medication errors studies that have been undertaken in the Middle East. The review identified 45 studies from 10 Middle Eastern countries. Nine of the studies focused on medication errors in paediatric patients. Educational programmes on drug therapy for doctors and nurses are urgently needed in the Middle East. These studies have contributed to the field of medication safety by providing more information about <b>double</b> and single <b>checking</b> medication administration processes in paediatric hospitals. More educational and training programmes for nurses about the importance of <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> and improving their adherence rate to the <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> steps during medication administration are required to improve its effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|RATIONALE AND AIM: The <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> of {{medicines}} {{in health care}} is a contestable procedure. It occupies an obvious position in health care practice and is understood to be an effective defence against medication error but the process is variable and the outcomes have not been exposed to testing. This paper presents an appraisal of the process using data from part of a larger study on the contributory factors in medication errors and their reporting. METHODS: Previous research studies are reviewed; data are analysed from a review of 991 drug error reports and a subsequent series of 40 in-depth interviews with health professionals in an acute hospital in northern England. RESULTS: The incident reports showed that errors occurred despite <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> but that action taken did not appear to investigate the checking process. Most interview participants (34) talked extensively about <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> but believed the process to be inconsistent. Four key categories were apparent: deference to authority, reduction of responsibility, automatic processing and lack of time. Solutions to the problems were also offered, which are discussed with several recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Double</b> <b>checking</b> medicines should be a selective and systematic procedure informed by key principles and encompassing certain behaviours. Psychological research may be instructive in reducing checking errors but the aviation industry may also have a part to play in increasing error wisdom and reducing risk...|$|R

40|$|Patient safety {{has been}} on the {{research}} agenda since 2000, when unnecessary harm to patients in providers’ care came to light. In 2005, the improvements in patient safety fell short of expectations, and the patient safety research community recognized that the issues are more difficult to resolve than first thought. One of the tools to address this vexing problem has been voluntary incident reporting systems, although the literature has given incident reporting systems mixed reviews. This qualitative comparative case study comprises 85 semi-structured interviews in two separate divisions of a tertiary care hospital, General Internal Medicine (GIM) and Obstetrics and Neonatology (OBS/NEO). The main line of questioning concerned incident reporting; general views of patient safety were also sought. This is a thesis by publication. The thesis consists of a general introduction to patient safety, a literature review, a description of the methods and cases, followed by the manuscripts. The thesis concludes with a summarization of the findings, and implications of the study. Manuscript one focuses on the reporter end of incident reporting systems. It asks what frames underlie GIM nurse and physician self reporting and peer reporting practices. The findings showed that frames that inhibit reporting are shared by physicians and nurses, such as the fear of blame frame regarding self reporting, and the tattletale frame regarding peer reporting. These frames are underpinned by a focus on the individual, despite the organisational message of reporting for learning. A learning frame is an enabler to incident reporting. Viewing the objective of voluntary incident reporting as learning allows practitioners to depersonalize incident reporting. The focus becomes preventing recurrence and not the individual reporting or reported on. Manuscript two again focuses on the reporter end, and on one type of reportable incident – a problem that healthcare practitioners can fix themselves. The study asks: when faced with such a problem, do practitioners fix it in the moment and forget about it, or do they fix it in the moment and report it? We found that “fixing and forgetting” was the main choice that most GIM practitioners made in situations where they faced problems that they themselves could resolve. These situations included a) handling near misses, which were seen as unworthy of reporting since they did not result in actual harm to the patient, b) prioritizing solving individual patients’ safety problems, which were viewed as unique or one-time events, and c) encountering re-occurring safety problems, which were framed as inevitable, routine events. The paper argues that fixing and forgetting patient safety problems encountered may not serve patient safety as well as fixing and reporting. The latter approach aligns with a preventive view of patient safety. Manuscript three focuses on the practice of <b>double</b> <b>checking,</b> drawing from interviews conducted in both GIM and OBS/NEO. It asks what weaknesses are in the <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> process and what alternative views can help the <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> process enhance patient safety. The findings showed weaknesses in the <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> process, such as: a) <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> trusted as an independent process, b) <b>double</b> (or more) <b>checking</b> as a costly and time consuming procedure, and c) <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> as preventing reporting of near misses. It is proposed that there are alternative ways of viewing and practising <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> in order to enhance patient safety. These include: a) recognizing that <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> requires training, b) introducing automated <b>double</b> <b>checking,</b> and c) expanding <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> beyond error detection. The paper argues that practitioners need to be more aware of the caveats of <b>double</b> <b>checking,</b> and to view the <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> process through alternate lenses to help enhance its effectiveness. Manuscript four focuses on the reporting system more comprehensively, and attends to the reporting process in GIM and OBS/NEO. This is a comparative case study of the two divisions, and considers the different stages in the process and the factors that help shape the process. The findings showed that there were major differences between the two divisions in terms of: a) what comprised a typical report (outcome based vs communication and near-miss based); b) how the reports were investigated (individual manager vs interdisciplinary team); c) learning from reporting (interventions having ambiguous linkages to the reporting system vs interventions having clear linkages to reported incidents); and d) feedback (limited feedback vs multiple feedback). The differences between the two divisions can be explained in terms of: a) the influence of litigation on practice, b) the availability or lack of interprofessional training, and c) the introduction of the reporting system (top-down vs bottom-up approach). A model based on the findings portraying the influences on incident reporting and learning is provided. This thesis contributes to an in-depth understanding of front line perspectives on incident reporting systems and safety, and aims to provide insights into improving patient safety. Implications for practice and research will be addressed...|$|R

500|$|As {{originally}} enacted, the Horse Protection Act was to {{be enforced}} by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), {{a branch of the}} USDA. However, a lack of staff and funding meant little success, leading to the 1976 amendment to the act. With this amendment, Congress created a Designated Qualified Person (DQP) program. This program allows non-USDA employees from within the equine community to take training and certification programs run by Horse Industry Organizations (HIOs) and supervised by the USDA; after completing the training, they may complete inspections for violations of the HPA at public events. The USDA is then able to <b>double</b> <b>check</b> the work of DQP participants by making random inspections at a small number of shows. One member of the Tennessee Walking Horse world states that this creates [...] "the potential for a [...] "fox guarding the chicken coop" [...] situation", as if the HIO is not fully interested in preventing or detecting the practice of soring, the DQPs may not be fully trained or may deliberately overlook instances of soring. When APHIS inspectors are present at horse shows, the number of citations for violations increases significantly. Competitors and trainers at shows, viewing themselves as unjustly persecuted, have been known to leave when they find APHIS inspectors present, rather than allowing the inspectors to see their horses. In June 2012, the USDA published a new rule requiring violations found by HIOs to have penalties assessed at a rate equal to or exceeding those given by APHIS inspectors. Previously, HIOs were allowed to set their own penalty rates, resulting in some organizations acting leniently towards violators of the HPA.|$|E
