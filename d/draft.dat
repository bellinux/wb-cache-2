5|$|A {{territorial}} pick was a type {{of special}} <b>draft</b> choice used in the Basketball Association of America (BAA) <b>draft</b> in 1949 and in the National Basketball Association (NBA) <b>draft</b> after the 1950 season, {{the year in which}} the BAA was renamed the NBA.

The Timberwolves drafted Pooh Richardson with their first ever <b>draft</b> pick, tenth overall, in the 1989 NBA <b>draft.</b> In 1995, the Timberwolves picked Kevin Garnett fifth overall, who went on to be a 13-time All-Star. In 1996, the Timberwolves drafted Ray Allen fifth overall but was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks with a future first-round pick for the <b>draft</b> rights of Stephon Marbury. In the 2008 NBA <b>draft,</b> the Timberwolves drafted O. J. Mayo third overall but was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies along with three other players from the Timberwolves for the <b>draft</b> rights to Kevin Love along with three other players from the Grizzlies.|$|E
