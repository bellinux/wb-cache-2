5|$|Aarhus is in {{the humid}} {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen: Dfb) and the weather is influenced by low-pressure systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Temperature varies a great deal across the seasons with a mild spring in April and May, warmer summer months from June to August, frequently rainy and windy autumn months in October and September and cooler winter months, often with snow and frost, from December to March. The city centre <b>experiences</b> <b>the</b> same climatic effects as other larger cities with higher wind speeds, more fog, less precipitation and higher temperatures than the surrounding, open land.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} from prison, Berkman served as editor of Goldman's anarchist journal, Mother Earth, and later {{established}} his own journal, The Blast. In 1917, Berkman and Goldman were sentenced {{to two years in}} jail for conspiracy against the newly instated draft. After their release from prison, they were arrested—along with hundreds of others—and deported to Russia. Initially supportive of that country's Bolshevik revolution, Berkman and Goldman soon became disillusioned, voicing their opposition to the Soviet's use of terror after seizing power and their repression of fellow revolutionaries. In 1925, he published a book about his <b>experiences,</b> <b>The</b> Bolshevik Myth.|$|E
5|$|After the {{critical}} and commercial success of Awakening, development began on Fates, {{with the staff}} of Awakening returning to their previous roles. The team's main concern was adding new features and refinements to the original gameplay, and improving the story, which had received criticism from fans. To this end, writer Shin Kibayashi was brought in. To show {{all sides of the}} story and provide players with different Fire Emblem <b>experiences,</b> <b>the</b> game was split up into multiple versions. Upon release, it met with highly positive reviews: Birthright was generally seen as a good starting place for new players, Conquest was praised for its challenge, while Revelation was noted as a good middle ground between the two releases.|$|E

40|$|In {{a variety}} of contexts, {{such as in the}} study of the {{incidence}} of accidents (Bates and Neyman 1951), labor force participation (Heckman and Willis 1977) and unemployment (Layton 1978), it is often noted that individuals who have experienced an event in the past are more likely to <b>experience</b> <b>the</b> event in the future than are individuals who have not <b>experienced</b> <b>the</b> event. The conditional probability that an individual will <b>experience</b> <b>the</b> event in the future is a function of past experience. There are two explanations for this empirical regularity. One explanation is that as a consequence of experiencing an event, preferences, prices, or constraints relevant to future choices (or out-comes) are altered. In this case past experience has a genuine behavioral effect in the sense that an otherwise identical individual who did not <b>experience</b> <b>the</b> event would behave differently in the future than an individual who <b>experienced</b> <b>the</b> event. Structural relationships of this sort give rise to true state dependence as defined in this paper. A second explanation is that individuals may differ in certain unmea-sured variables that influence their probability of <b>experiencing</b> <b>the</b> even...|$|R
5|$|Many mental states {{seem to be}} {{experienced}} subjectively in different ways by different individuals. And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since {{no one has a}} perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels to hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative <b>experiences.</b> <b>The</b> puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.|$|E
