5|$|In the east, Selvo {{not only}} {{maintained}} good {{trade relations with}} the Byzantine Empire, but also married into their royal family to consolidate the alliance that had existed for many years between the two nations. In 1075, Selvo married Teodora Ducas, daughter of Constantine X and sister of the reigning emperor, Michael VII. Though Venetians, especially the nobles, were wary of the pageantry that accompanied the marriage and the royal bride, the strengthened alliance meant <b>even</b> <b>greater</b> mobility for Venetian merchants in the east. Though {{the popularity of the}} new dogaressa was not great, Selvo was the hero of the merchant class that had had <b>even</b> <b>greater</b> political sway since the depositions of the Orseoli.|$|E

5|$|Separately, {{recent work}} using {{computational}} phylogenetic methods claims {{to show that}} punctuational bursts play an important factor when languages split from one another, accounting for anywhere from 10 to 33% of the total divergence in vocabulary.

5|$|This, in turn, {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of <b>even</b> <b>greater</b> excesses; to pay the Spartan garrison's wages, Critias and the leaders ordered each of the Thirty to arrest and execute a metic, or resident alien, and confiscate his property.

5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>greater</b> {{assistance}} {{came from}} Samoset and Tisquantum (better known as Squanto), a Native American sent by Wampanoag Tribe Chief Massasoit as an ambassador and technical adviser. Squanto had been kidnapped in 1614 by an English slave raider {{and sold in}} Málaga, Spain. He learned English, escaped slavery, and returned home in 1619. He taught the colonists how to farm corn, where and how to catch fish, and other helpful skills for the New World.

5|$|In 1345, while Grosmont was in France, {{his father}} died. The younger Henry was now Earl of Lancaster – the wealthiest and most {{powerful}} peer of the realm. After participating in the Siege of Calais in 1347, the king honoured Lancaster by including him as a founding knight of the Order of the Garter in 1348. A few years later, in 1351, Edward bestowed an <b>even</b> <b>greater</b> honour on Lancaster when he created him Duke of Lancaster. The title of duke was of relatively new origin in England; only one other ducal title existed previously.|$|E
5|$|In post-production, Embassy's self-imposed role {{in making}} Crimewave was <b>even</b> <b>greater.</b> Although Raimi, Tapert, and Campbell {{insisted that they}} had made the film as partners, the studio refused — because of the already {{ballooning}} costs — to pay for Campbell to stay in Los Angeles during post-production (although the executives later compromised). The studio replaced Raimi's music composer, Joseph LoDuca, with {{one of its own}} choosing. It did the same with the editor, removing Raimi's influence over the film's final cut.|$|E

5|$|In practice, {{the huge}} Valdez glacier that stood between the port and the Alaskan {{interior}} proved almost insurmountable and only 200 managed to climb it; by 1899, {{the cold and}} scurvy was causing many deaths amongst the rest. Other prospectors attempted an alternative route across the Malaspina Glacier just to the east, suffering <b>even</b> <b>greater</b> hardships. Those who did manage to cross it found themselves having to negotiate miles of wilderness before they could reach Dawson.

5|$|In {{the first}} two months of 1944, Hartmann claimed over 50 Soviet aircraft. This {{included}} 25 in January. On 26 February 1944 he claimed 10 fighters shot down, all of them Soviet-flown P-39s. Hartmann continued scoring at an <b>even</b> <b>greater</b> pace. His spectacular rate of success raised a few eyebrows even in the Luftwaffe High Command; his claims were double and triple-checked, and his performance closely monitored by an observer flying in his formation. On 2 March, he reached 202.|$|E
5|$|Most recently, Triumph International {{has been}} the subject of <b>even</b> <b>greater</b> {{criticism}} after mass layoffs in Thailand and the Philippines at the end of 2009 were met with transnational protests by trade unions.

Allegations that, parallel to the redundancies, another location was being set up in Thailand, were rejected.|$|E

5|$|Stern {{has also}} written that the {{disruption}} to the convoys off Norway caused by Operation Leader would have caused <b>even</b> <b>greater</b> damage to the German war effort than the shipping losses. This {{is in line with}} a wartime assessment by the British Ministry of Economic Warfare, which estimated that the raid was the main factor responsible for a 58 percent decrease in the amount of iron ore shipped from the important northern Norwegian port of Narvik during October 1943.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} {{impact of}} the Second Crusade was <b>even</b> <b>greater</b> in France, with many troubadours fascinated by the alleged affair between Eleanor and Raymond, which helped to feed the theme of courtly love.

5|$|The {{idea of a}} {{fast mail}} route to the Pacific coast was {{prompted}} largely by California's newfound prominence and its rapidly growing population. After gold was discovered there in 1848, thousands of prospectors, investors and businessmen {{made their way to}} California, at that time a new territory of the U.S. By 1850, California entered the Union as a free state. By 1860, the population had grown to 380,000. The demand for a faster way to get mail and other communications to and from this westernmost state became <b>even</b> <b>greater</b> as the American Civil War approached.|$|E

5|$|The {{work of the}} Westminster Assembly was repudiated by the Church of England {{during the}} Restoration in 1660. The Act of Uniformity 1662, a law {{requiring}} <b>even</b> <b>greater</b> adherence to the Book of Common Prayer and support for episcopalianism than had previously been required, forced Puritan ministers to leave the Church. Though some presbyterians continued to desire to be readmitted to the established church, restrictions on worship for non-conformists led to presbyterians putting aside differences with congregationalists and adopting congregational church orders.|$|E
5|$|Turkey's {{extraordinary}} ecosystem {{and habitat}} diversity has produced considerable species diversity. Anatolia is the homeland of many plants {{that have been}} cultivated for food {{since the advent of}} agriculture, and the wild ancestors of many plants that now provide staples for humankind still grow in Turkey. The diversity of Turkey's fauna is <b>even</b> <b>greater</b> than that of its flora. The number of animal species in the whole of Europe is around 60,000, while in Turkey there are over 80,000 (over 100,000 counting the subspecies).|$|E
5|$|Agricultural runoff {{containing}} {{pesticide residues}} {{has also been}} concentrated in the lower river in greater amounts. Toxins derived from pesticides have led to fish kills; six of these events were recorded between 1964 and 1968 alone. The pesticide issue is <b>even</b> <b>greater</b> in streams and water bodies near agricultural lands irrigated by the Imperial Irrigation District with Colorado River water. In the Imperial Valley, Colorado River water used for irrigation overflows into the New and Alamo rivers and into the Salton Sea. Both rivers and the sea {{are among the most}} polluted bodies of water in the United States, posing dangers not only to aquatic life but to contact by humans and migrating birds.
