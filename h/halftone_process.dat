40|$|Digital image {{watermarking}} is {{the process}} of encoding information into a digital image without deteriorating the visual quality of the image. Digital watermarking techniques are designed to withstand various attacks such as standard image processing operations, compression and geometric transformations. In this report we focus on watermarking of printed images and argue that this application requires specialized methods. Previous work relating to hardcopy watermarking applied standard digital watermarking schemes or suggested techniques that exploit the specific printing (i. e. <b>halftoning)</b> <b>process.</b> This work proposes a novel transform domain hardcopy watermarking technique that is independent of the <b>halftoning</b> <b>process</b> and is rather based on a noise model for the printing and scanning operations. The proposed scheme allows for blind watermark decoding, i. e. the encoder does not know the original image. It is image adaptable, to enhance the visual quality, and is tuneable on the trade-off between information embedding, rate, and visual quality...|$|R

There was not one <b>halftone</b> <b>process,</b> but a considerable number of them, the earliest dating nearly {{as far back as the}} introduction of practical photography in 1839. They varied widely in their degree of practicality and the quality of their results. The first attempts involved directly etching the unique images formed on metallic Daguerreotype plates. Although pleasing results were obtained, etching the plates required great skill and care, the images could not be printed along with ordinary type, and the delicate plates wore out after a very small number of impressions, making such processes useless for publishing on a commercial scale. More practical processes started appearing in the 1860s, but high cost, special printing requirements or low image quality variously kept these early processes from coming into widespread use.|$|E

Prior to such processes, images were printed in books and periodicals by means of hand-engraved metal plates or wood blocks, or from drawings made on lithographic stones.

40|$|An {{analytical}} approach is proposed {{to explain the}} appearance of unwanted low frequency artifacts during the random dithering <b>halftoning</b> <b>process.</b> The solution uses a theorem which relates the correlation of the input gray level (continuous) signal to the correlation of the output (halftone) binary signal. The numerical solution of the above relationship suggests that: 1. Introduction of low frequency artifacts is inevitable. 2. The effect is enhanced for mean gray levels farther from mid-gray. 3. High frequency information in the input signal is attenuated more than low frequency information...|$|R
40|$|Error-diffusion and its {{variants}} {{are commonly}} used halftoning techniques that produce dispersed dot (FM) halftones, which are often preferred because they are free from low-frequency structure. Since the isolated dots resulting from error diffusion are reproduced well on inkjet printers, error diffusion is commonly employed in these devices. Inkjet printers often print a page in two passes {{in order to allow}} for better drying of inks and to minimize appearance of a head signature. Any potential misregistration between the passes is typically not comprehended in the error-diffusion <b>halftoning</b> <b>process.</b> The mis-registration between the passes can therefore cause significantly increased graininess (low-frequency structure) in printed error diffusion images even though the electronic bitmaps generated by error diffusion are free from low-frequency structure. In this paper, we propose modifications to the error-diffusion <b>halftoning</b> <b>process</b> that take the two pass printing into account and produce halftones that are robust to inter-pass mis-registration errors. This allows reduced tolerances and alignment requirements in manufacturing that translate to lower cost. The proposed technique works by suitably biasing the error diffusion process to ensure {{that a majority of the}} minority pixels are concentrated in a single pass, which provides improved robustness to mis-registration between the passes. Experimental results demonstrate that the modified error-diffusion technique performs significantly better than regular error diffusion in the presence of mis-registration errors...|$|R
50|$|Where {{continuous}} tone imagery contains an infinite {{range of colors}} or greys, the <b>halftone</b> <b>process</b> reduces visual reproductions to an image that is printed with only one color of ink, in dots of differing size (amplitude modulation) or spacing (frequency modulation). This reproduction relies on a basic optical illusion: the tiny halftone dots are blended into smooth tones by the human eye. At a microscopic level, developed black-and-white photographic film also consists of only two colors, and not an infinite range of {{continuous tone}}s. For details, see film grain.|$|E
50|$|Stochastic {{screening}} or FM screening is a <b>halftone</b> <b>process</b> {{based on}} pseudo-random distribution of halftone dots, using frequency modulation (FM) {{to change the}} density of dots according to the gray level desired. Traditional amplitude modulation halftone screening {{is based on a}} geometric and fixed spacing of dots, which vary in size depending on the tone color represented (for example, from 10 to 200 micrometres). The stochastic screening or FM screening instead uses a fixed size of dots (for example, about 25 micrometres) and a distribution density that varies depending on the color’s tone.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{photoengraving}} for a <b>halftone</b> <b>process</b> {{that could}} be used to print grayscale photographic images dates all the way back to the 1839 introduction of the daguerreotype, the first practical photographic process. The daguerreotype image consisted of a microscopically fine granular structure on the surface of a silver-plated copper sheet that had been polished to a mirror finish. Methods were soon devised for differentially etching the image grains and the ground so that the daguerreotype could be used as a printing plate. In some instances, very pleasing results were obtained, but exceptional skill and care were required and the very fine structure of the image limited the useful life of each plate to a few hundred prints at best.|$|E

50|$|Whereas {{xerography}} and {{inkjet printing}} employ a <b>halftone</b> <b>process</b> and ink to reproduce digital images on paper, digital-C is a photographic continuous tone process rather than halftone or error diffusion which are common on offset press or ink-jet. The device natively supports 24-bit RGB raster files, and is capable printing vector based files when fronted by a photographic Raster Image Processor (RIP). 24 bit color continuous-tone devices use large multitudes of colors, up to 16,777,216, {{rather than the}} small number of colors available to 4-color press and 8-color ink-jet type devices. Therefore, posterization and banding are unlikely from these types of prints when provided with a file of good integrity. Due to slight halation of the light source, digital C-prints produced on high end equipment have true continuous tones not possible with images created with ink or pigments (due to CMYK halftone limitations).|$|E
5000|$|The {{period during}} the American Civil War {{was a time}} when all images in a {{publication}} had to be hand drawn and engraved by skilled artists. Photography existed {{but there was no way}} to transfer a photograph to a printing plate since this was well before the advent of the <b>halftone</b> <b>process</b> for printing photographs. Photographic equipment was too cumbersome and exposure times were too slow to be used on the battlefield. An artist such as Waud would do detailed sketches in the field, which were then rushed by courier back to the main office of the newspaper they were working for. There a staff of engravers would use the sketches to create engravings on blocks of boxwood. Since the blocks were about 4 inches across they would have to be composited together to make one large illustration. The wood engraving was then copied via the electrotype process which produced a metal printing plate for publication. In 1860, Alfred Waud became an illustrator or [...] "special artist" [...] (a full-time paid staff artist) for the New York Illustrated News. In April 1861, the newspaper assigned Waud to cover the Army of the Potomac, Virginia's main Union army. He first illustrated General Winfield Scott in Washington, D.C., and then entered the field to render the First Battle of Bull Run in July. Waud followed a Union expedition to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina the next month and witnessed the Battle of Hatteras Inlet Batteries. That autumn, he sketched army activity in the Tidewater region of Virginia. Waud joined Harper's Weekly toward the end of 1861, continuing to cover the war. In 1864 Alfred's brother, William Waud (who up to that time had been working with [...] "Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper"), joined Alfred on the staff of Harper's and they worked together during the Petersburg Campaign.|$|E
30|$|The halftoning and inverse <b>halftoning</b> <b>processes</b> can be {{regarded}} as the encoding and decoding processes of vector quantization. Therefore, the codebook design methods can be applied to build the inverse halftoning lookup tables [6, 7]. The content of a table entry is the centroid of the input samples that are mapped to this entry. The results are optimal in the sense of minimizing the MSE for a given halftone method. Although the table lookup method has the advantages of good reconstructed quality and fast speed, it faces the empty cell problem in which no or very few training samples are mapped to a specific halftone pattern.|$|R

There exist several inverse halftoning methods, including kernel estimation [1], wavelet [2], filtering [3, 4], and set theoretic approaches [5].
