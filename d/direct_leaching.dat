40|$|The {{recycling}} of spent Zn-MnO 2 batteries by hydrometallurgy involves the leaching of material previously treated by physical processing {{to allow the}} liberation of electrode particles and the separation of unwanted scrap. The integration of these physical operations with leaching is therefore crucial for the optimization of the process, allowing achieving high recovery yields of zinc and manganese and minimizing reactants consumption and iron contamination. In this paper, several options involving physical processing and leaching with sulphuric acid are presented and discussed. After batteries shredding and disaggregation, the separation of steel scrap was performed by sieving or magnetic separation, and the remaining solids were treated by leaching. These options were compared, in terms of metals recovery and contamination, with the alternative of <b>direct</b> <b>leaching</b> of all the shredded fractions without physical treatment. The separation of the steel scrap by sieving or magnetic separation allowed the removal from the circuit of 37 or 49 % of iron, respectively, with losses of 15 or 6 % of zinc and 2 or 4 % of manganese. Therefore more than 50 % of iron remained in the process, which was attributed {{to the presence of}} iron oxides formed by the corrosion of the battery cases. In the leaching operation, zinc dissolution was very effective (yields above 97 %) while manganese is strongly depended from the process option, being its leaching proportional to the presence of scrap (yields of 80 %, 56 % and 43 %, respectively in <b>direct</b> <b>leaching,</b> sieving / leaching and magnetic separation / leaching).

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{storage of}} bauxite residue (red mud) is {{harmful to the}} environment and the tailing ponds also cover large areas. At the moment there is no largescale utilization of bauxite residue. However, some bauxite residues contain considerable concentrations of rare-earth elements (REEs) and the recovery of these REEs together with(out) other metals and utilization of the generated residue in other applications (e. g., building materials) can solve the storage problem of bauxite residue. This paper reviews the recovery of REEs, possibly alongside other valuable metals, from bauxite residue. REEs can be recovered from bauxite residue by <b>direct</b> <b>leaching</b> or by smelting followed by leaching. The main disadvantages of direct acid leaching are the consumption of large amounts of acid for neutralization, the handling of large volumes of effluents, and the difficulty in using the bauxite residue after leaching. Recovery of iron prior to leaching can improve the economics of the process. However, high alumina in the bauxite residue increases the flux and acid consumption. Therefore, alumina needs to be removed by alkali roasting prior to smelting in order to decrease the flux and acid consumption. The alkali roasting–smelting–leaching process allows recovery of aluminum, iron, titanium, and REEs from bauxite residue. The residue generated in this process can be used in building materials and cementitious binders. Other processes with commercial potential are the Orbite, the pressure leaching, and the acid baking processes. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Rising {{levels of}} {{nitrogen}} (N) deposition are influencing urban forest carbon (C) and N dynamics due to greater human disturbance {{compared to those}} in rural areas. N deposition in combination with increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) and water limitation may alter C and N storage in urban forests. This review aimed to provide {{a better understanding of}} N and C storage under N deposition scenarios in urban forests. Results and discussion: Globally, fuel combustion and biomass burning contribute in approximately 70 and 16 % of the NOx emission respectively. It is also estimated that NHy and NOx are two to four times higher in urban forests compared to rural areas. However, higher N deposition may not always result in increased N and C storage in urban forests. In fact, urban forests may even show early symptoms of N and C losses under climate change. For example, urban forests in fire-prone areas require higher frequency of burning to reduce the threat of wildfires, leading to an acceleration of C and N loss. Additionally, chronic N deposition may result in an early N loss in urban forests due to faster N saturation and soil acidification in urban forests compared to rural forests. Studies of N deposition on urban forests using N isotope composition (δ 15 N) also showed that N loss from urban forests can occur through the <b>direct</b> <b>leaching</b> of the deposited NO 3 −-N. We also noted that using different 15 N signal of soil and plant in combination of tree ring δ 15 N may provide a better understanding of N movement in urban forests. Conclusions: Although urban forests may become a source of C and N faster than rural forests, N-limited urban forests may benefit from N deposition to retain both N and C stocks longer than non-N-limited urban forests. Appropriate management practices may also help to delay such symptoms; however, the main source of emission still needs to be managed to reduce both N deposition and rising atmospheric CO 2 in urban forests. Otherwise, the N and C stocks in urban forests may further decline when prolonged drought conditions under global climate change increase the frequency of fires and reduce plant photosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|Abberton, M. T., Marshall, A. H. (2005). Progress in {{breeding}} perennial clovers for temperate agriculture: centenary review. Journal of Agricultural Science, 143 (2 - 3), 117 - 135 White clover (Trifolium repens L.) and {{red clover}} (T. pratense L.) {{are the most}} important legumes of temperate pastures. The former is used largely in systems based around sheep or cattle grazing and is grown together with a companion grass. Breeding aims to optimize the white clover contribution to the sward. This means that yield per se is not the aim but rather {{to take full advantage of}} the benefits of white clover; in particular, nitrogen fixation, high protein content, digestibility, mineral content and high intake. The objective is an agronomically and, as far as possible, nutritionally balanced sward, thus persistence of white clover and yield stability over a number of years are key goals. A considerable focus of germplasm improvement has therefore been overcoming biotic and abiotic stresses to clover performance. The former include not only pests and diseases but also the impact of the ruminant animal and the competitive interaction with the companion grass, while abiotic stress could be loosely defined as ?winter hardiness? and ?summer survival? depending on the site. In recent years the focus of many breeding efforts has shifted to give more consideration to the effects of variation within white clover germplasm on animal performance and the environment. Beneficial effects on productivity have been known for many years, but recent studies of the impact of forage diets on meat and milk quality have opened up new opportunities for improvement. Diffuse pollution of nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural sources is high on the environmental protection agenda of many governments. Breeding efforts are now being made to reduce the contribution of clovers to both <b>direct</b> (<b>leaching)</b> and indirect (through animal returns) pollution. In particular, recent insights into mechanisms affecting protein breakdown in the rumen and silo offer new prospects for breeding interventions to reduce environmental impacts. Molecular marker methods are being developed in white clover and the transfer and use of resources and information accumulating in the model legumes Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus is likely to be a major route by which the power of genomic approaches is translated into forage legume improvement. Hybrids of white clover and related species have been developed to introgress key traits; namely, drought tolerance, grazing tolerance of large leaf types and enhanced seed yield, for which only limited genetic variation is present within the white clover gene pool. Red clover is less persistent than white clover, is typically cut three or more times in a season and is used to make silage for winter feed. Although it is often grown with a companion grass, monocultures are common and yield per se as well as persistency and pest and disease resistance are major breeding aims. Fewer agronomic studies and less germplasm improvement have been carried out in this species and molecular studies are not as well advanced although, as with white clover, future developments are likely to benefit greatly from a close relationship to model legumes. Red clover brings considerable benefits in terms of animal production and meat and milk quality. These aspects, alongside approaches to reduce nitrogenous pollution from the silo, represent considerable opportunities for variety development. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis describes the development work {{performed on the}} leachand purification sections in the electrolytic zinc plant in Kokkola {{to increase the efficiency}} in these two stages, and thus the competitiveness of the plant. Since metallic zinc is a typical bulk product, the improvement of the competitiveness of a plant was mostly an issue of decreasing unit costs. The problems in the leaching were low recovery of valuable metals from raw materials, and that the available technology offered complicated and expensive processes to overcome this problem. In the purification, the main problem was consumption of zinc powder - up to four to six times the stoichiometric demand. This reduced the capacity of the plant as this zinc is re-circulated through the electrolysis, which is the absolute bottleneck in a zinc plant. Low selectivity gave low-grade and low-value precipitates for further processing to metallic copper, cadmium, cobalt and nickel. Knowledge of the underlying chemistry was poor and process interruptions causing losses of zinc production were frequent. Studies on leaching comprised the kinetics of ferrite leaching and jarosite precipitation, as well as the stability of jarosite in acidic plant solutions. A breakthrough came with the finding that jarosite could precipitate under conditions where ferrite would leach satisfactorily. Based on this discovery, a one-step process for the treatment of ferrite was developed. In the plant, the new process almost doubled the recovery of zinc from ferrite in the same equipment as the two-step jarosite process was operated in at that time. In a later expansion of the plant, investment savings were substantial compared to other technologies available. In the solution purification, the key finding was that Co, Ni, and Cu formed specific arsenides in the “hot arsenic zinc dust” step. This was utilized {{for the development of a}} three-step purification stage based on fluidized bed technology in all three steps, i. e. removal of Cu, Co and Cd. Both precipitation rates and selectivity increased, which strongly decreased the zinc powder consumption through a substantially suppressed hydrogen gas evolution. Better selectivity improved the value of the precipitates: cadmium, which caused environmental problems in the copper smelter, was reduced from 1 - 3 % reported normally down to 0. 05 %, and a cobalt cake with 15 % Co was easily produced in laboratory experiments in the cobalt removal. The zinc powder consumption in the plant for a solution containing Cu, Co, Ni and Cd (1000, 25, 30 and 350 mg/l, respectively), was around 1. 8 g/l; i. e. only 1. 4 times the stoichiometric demand – or, about 60 % saving in powder consumption. Two processes for <b>direct</b> <b>leaching</b> of the concentrate under atmospheric conditions were developed, one of which was implemented in the Kokkola zinc plant. Compared to the existing pressure leach technology, savings were obtained mostly in investment. The scientific basis for the most important processes and process improvements is given in the {{doctoral thesis}}. This includes mathematical modeling and thermodynamic evaluation of experimental results and hypotheses developed. Five of the processes developed in this research and development program were implemented in the plant and are still operated. Even though these processes were developed with the focus on the plant in Kokkola, they can also be implemented at low cost in most of the zinc plants globally, and have thus a great significance in the development of the electrolytic zinc process in general...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} work was to study the beneficiation of rare earth ore of the Bokan Mountain [...] Dotson Ridge deposit, located near Ketchikan, Alaska. Rare earth element (REE) composite ore samples from the Bokan Mountain [...] Dotson Ridge deposit were tested using gravity concentration, magnetic separation, flotation, and leaching techniques to separate the REE. The composite ore sample {{was a product of}} a preliminary x-ray sorting process. Qualitative electron microprobe analysis of the ore showed that most of the REE minerals in the ore were silicate minerals. Since the electron microprobe analysis samples were coated with carbon during sample preparation, the carbon element was inactivated for analysis. Because of this, carbonate compounds of minerals' particles could not be detected. 95 % of the REE mineral particles appear to be smaller than about 10 μm in size (about 100 μm² in area). For the gravity concentration, light rare earth elements (LREE) and heavy rare earth elements' (HREE) individual elemental recovery values were in the ranges of 49. 6 - 52. 8 % and 46. 3 - 48. 8 %, respectively, at 25 % of mass yield. In order to separate a larger amount of the REE, a wet high intensity magnetic separation (WHIMS) test was carried out on tailings of the gravity concentration tests. The HREE individual elemental recovery values ranged from 56. 3 - 63. 1 % at 37 % mass yield, while LREE individual elemental recovery values were in the 57. 9 % - 59. 1 % range. For the combined gravity and magnetic separation processes, the net individual elemental recovery values of the LREE and the HREE were in the range of 79. 6 - 80. 5 % and 76. 5 - 80. 9 %, respectively. The combined mass yield of the gravity and magnetic separation processes was 3 %. <b>Direct</b> <b>leaching</b> tests conducted on the composite ground ore feed yielded high individual elemental recovery values of 90 - 92 % of the LREE. The HREE individual elemental recovery values ranged from 56. 5 - 87. 3 %. In the leaching, 20 % HCl was used in the 1 st and 2 nd stages with a duration of 2 hrs in each stage at 90 °C. The solid percentage of the leach slurry was 20 % w/w. The composite ground ore sample was tested in conventional flotation using a 2. 0 L capacity Denver cell. In the flotation, 0. 05 kg/tonne of Cytec Aero 6493 collector, 0. 05 kg/tonne of Cytec Aero Froth 88, and 0. 1 kg/tonne of sodium metasilicate as a depressant were used. Pulp pH was set around 9. Results showed individual elemental recovery values in the range of 44. 6 - 50. 4 % or the LREE. The HREE individual elemental recovery values ranged from 27. 9 - 44. 5 %. The mass yield of the flotation was 23 %. The flotation recoveries reported here are significantly lower than what was achieved previously. For the Leach after flotation process, leaching was conducted on the first concentrate of flotation. Individual elemental recovery values of the LREE and HREE were 94. 7 - 96. 5 % and 61. 1 - 90. 5 %, respectively. The concentrate was leached using 20 % HCl in both the 1 st and 2 nd stages, with a duration of 2 hrs in each stage at 90 °C. Flotation/Leach process net recoveries of LREE by individual elemental values ranged from 42. 2 - 48. 5 %. HREE net recoveries by individual elemental values ranged from 17. 1 - 41. 4 %...|$|E
40|$|Although {{bacterial}} leaching of sulphidic minerals {{is a well-known}} phenomenon, {{it is only in}} the last ten years that full-scale {{bacterial leaching}} plants have been commissioned for gold processing. In order for bacterial leaching to compete successfully with other pretreatment processes for refractory ores, particularly with established technologies such as roasting and pressure leaching, it needs to be efficient. This requires the optimization of the parameters affecting the leaching reaction and the growth of bacteria. The entire biotreatment process is agitation leaching, carried out in stirred reactors or Pachuca type reactors. The bacterial oxidation is a complex reaction involving gaseous, liquid and solid phases. The interactions are highly complex, and analysis is complicated by the presence of solids in the leaching medium. Inspite of the amount of research that has been performed, kinetic and process models are underdeveloped. Since kinetic data varies widely with the type and source of concentrate, experimental data should be generated before doing the full-scale reactor design. In sizing reactors for a commercial scale process, it would be useful to have a mathematical model that one could use to predict the amount and rate of release of metal, as a function of the various operating parameters of the system. G. R. Halli arsenical gold sulphide concentrate obtained from Hutti Gold Mines Ltd., Karnataka, was chosen for our study, because of its high refractoriness. An indegenous strain of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans was used for biooxidation. The experiments were conducted in a well-agitated stirred tank reactor under controlled conditions. Sparged air was supplemented with carbon-dioxide for optimized growth. In this work, more than 90 % gold and 95 % silver could be recovered from the sulphidic gold concentrate when bioleaching was used ahead of cyanidation, compared to 40 % and 50 % by direct cyanidation. A generalized model, which accounts for both direct bacterial attack and indirect chemical leaching, has been proposed for the biooxidation of refractory gold concentrates. The bacterial balance, therefore, accounts for its growth both on solid substrate and in solution, and for the attachment to and detachment from the surface. The overall process is considered to consist of several sub-processes, each of which can be described in terms of a mechanism and related rate expressions. These sub-processes were studied seperately under kinetically controlled conditions. The key parameters appearing in the rate equations were evaluated using the experimental data. Since the refractory concentrate contains pyrite and arsenopyrite as the major leachable entities, leaching studies have been done on pure pyrite and arsenopyrite as test minerals and the key parameters in the rate equations are evaluated using this data. The model so developed is tested with the leaching kinetics of the concentrate. The growth of bacteria is dependent on the availability of the substrate, ferrous iron, and the dependence is modelled by the widely accepted Monod equation. The effect of carbon dioxide supplementation on the bacterial activity was studied and the optimal concentration for growth was found to be l%(v/v). Studies on indirect chemical leaching showed that the rate is sensitive to surface area of concentrate. Indirect rate constant of arsenopyrite was found to be greater than that of pyrite, since pyrite is more nobler than arsenopyrite. Conditions of <b>direct</b> <b>leaching</b> alone was obtained at high pulp density and using substrate adapted bacteria. The rate constant of arsenopyrite was found to be greater than that of pyrite. The parameters obtained were tested with the overall batch leaching data of the concentrate and favourable comparision was obtained. Thus, it has been possible to isolate the various simultaneous sub-processes occurring during the leaching and propose useful models to describe these processes in some detail. The model has been extended successfully to predict the continuous leaching behaviour using the parameters obtained from the batch data. Studies on the effect of residence time and pulp density on steady state behaviour showed that there is a critical residence time and pulp density below which washout conditions occur. The critical residence time at 10 % pulp density was found to be 11 hrs. Operation at pulp densities lower than 5 % and residence times lower than 72 hrs is not favourable for efficient leaching. Studies on the effect of initial ferric iron concentration showed that there exists an optimum concentration of ferric iron at which the time required to reach steady state is minimum...|$|E

40|$|A {{hydrometallurgical process}} to extract silver from the silver-lead ore in Boorchi,Mongolia by using {{thiourea}} leaching solution is studied in this work. Through {{the observation of}} optical and scanning electron microscopes,and energy spectral analysis,it is determined that 5 kinds of silver minerals exist in the ore,including argentite,Ag-tetrahedrite,Ag-Zn-Sb-tetrahedrite,freibergite and acanthite. The experimental results of <b>direct</b> thiourea <b>leaching</b> of the ore show that 56 %～ 60 % of silver is leached. The main reason for the low leaching rate is due to silver minerals enveloped in galena and other minerals,even though the ore is ground to the particle size of 75 μm. When the ore is pretreated with ammonium carbonate solution under oxidation,the experimental results of thiourea leaching show that the leaching rate of silver increases to near 75 % with the pretreatment. Based on the leaching experiments,a principle hydrometallurgical technological route to extract silver from the Ag-Pb ore is proposed...|$|R
3000|$|Another {{method for}} the {{recovery}} of Al and Ti involves leaching CFA by acid/alkali leaching followed by precipitation, solvent extraction, or re-crystallization (Matjie et al. 2005; Halina et al. 2007; Li et al. 2011). US Patent No. 4243640 (1981) investigated a process for {{the recovery of}} Al from CFA where the ash was subjected to a magnetic separation and subsequently leaching was carried out on the non-magnetic fraction using nitric acid (strength about 30 %– 56  %). The leachate was then evaporated and calcinated at 1000  °C for the recovery of Al. The calcinated product contained 90  % alumina along with other impurities like Fe oxides. US Patent No. 4567026 (1986) reported another acid leaching method for the recovery of Al and Ti from CFA. The process involved separation of magnetic fractions from the ash, followed by leaching the non-magnetic fraction with sulfuric acid, precipitating and removing Ti and Fe oxides from the leach solution by adding a strong base (NaOH), and precipitating and removing Al by contacting the reclaiming solution with CO 2. The precipitated aluminium hydroxide is calcinated to get aluminum oxide. However, <b>direct</b> sulfuric acid <b>leaching</b> yielded a low aluminum extraction (Matjie et al. 2005). Nayak and Panda (2010) also showed that <b>direct</b> sulphuric acid <b>leaching</b> at low concentration did not yield high aluminum recovery.|$|R
