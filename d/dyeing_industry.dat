5|$|In May 1941, Thomas and Caitlin {{moved to}} London, leaving their son with his {{grandmother}} at Blashford in Hampshire. Thomas hoped to find employment in the film industry and wrote {{to the director of}} the films division of the Ministry of Information (MOI). After being rebuffed, he found work with Strand Films, providing him with his first regular income since the Daily Post. Strand produced films for the MOI; Thomas scripted at least five films in 1942, This Is Colour (a history of the British <b>dyeing</b> <b>industry)</b> and New Towns For Old (on post-war reconstruction). These Are The Men (1943) was a more ambitious piece in which Thomas's verse accompanies Leni Riefenstahl's footage of an early Nuremberg Rally. Conquest of a Germ (1944) explored the use of early antibiotics in the fight against pneumonia and tuberculosis. Our Country (1945) was a romantic tour of Britain set to Thomas's poetry.|$|E

The dye was obtained from the Murex snail and dubbed [...] "Tyrian purple". The maroon coloring for Qatar's flag was selected in part due to the purple <b>dye</b> <b>industry</b> which existed on the island.|$|R

On Sunday August 9, 2009, Iliadis and his friend Emmanouil Tsakiropoulos (also a former agent of the amateur team Anagennisi Terpsitheas) were killed in a car accident that took place on the Thessaloniki-Katerini, national highway, near the bridge of the river Loudias.
