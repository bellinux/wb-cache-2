5000|$|<b>Kaiser's</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>newt</b> is {{endemic to}} the {{southern}} Zagros Mountains in Iran. It is primarily found in highland streams surrounded by arid scrubland, but {{can also be found}} in ponds and pools. It is known only from four streams in a single catchment area and has a total area of occupation of under 10 km2.

40|$|AbstractSalamanders have a {{remarkable}} capacity to regenerate complex tissues, such as limbs and brain, {{and are therefore}} an important comparative model system for regenerative medicine. Despite these unique properties among adult vertebrates, the genomic information for amphibians in general, and salamanders in particular, is scarce. Here, we used massive parallel sequencing to reconstruct a de novo reference transcriptome of the red <b>spotted</b> <b>newt</b> (Notophthalmus viridescens) containing 118, 893 transcripts with a N 50 length of 2016 nts. Comparisons to other vertebrates revealed a newt transcriptome that is comparable in size and characteristics to well-annotated vertebrate transcriptomes. Identification of putative open reading frames (ORFs) enabled us to infer a comprehensive proteome, including the annotation of 19, 903 newt proteins. We used the identified domain architectures (DAs) to assign ORFs phylogenetic positions, which also revealed putative salamander specific proteins. The reference transcriptome and inferred proteome of the red <b>spotted</b> <b>newt</b> will facilitate the use of systematic genomic technologies for regeneration studies in salamanders and enable evolutionary analyses of vertebrate regeneration at the molecular level...|$|R
50|$|Temperature in {{amphibians}} and reptiles directly affects metabolism in an exponential manner, {{and among}} ectotherms, temperature {{is one of the}} most important factors, acting directly upon metabolism. Since the newt is a poikilotherm, the purpose of this increase in metabolism is not to generate heat to regulate their internal temperature, but to counteract the depressive effect on standard metabolism that low atmospheric temperatures produce. For example, there is a direct correlation between the activity of certain muscle metabolic enzymes and the preferred body temperature of Eastern red <b>spotted</b> <b>newts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Dialectal English and Scots {{also has}} the word ask (also awsk, esk in Scots) used for both newts and wall lizards, from Old English āþexe, from Proto-Germanic *agiþahsijǭ, {{literally}} [...] "lizard-badger" [...] or [...] "distaff-like lizard" [...] (compare German Eidechse and Echse, both [...] "lizard"; *agi- is ultimately cognate with Greek ὄφις [...] "snake", from Proto-Indo-European *h₁ogʷʰis). Latin had the name stellio for a type of <b>spotted</b> <b>newt,</b> now used for species of the Stellagama genus. Ancient Greek had the name κορδύλος, presumably for the water newt (immature newt, eft). German has Molch, from Middle High German mol, :wikt:olm, like the English term of unknown etymology.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{example of}} {{scramble}} competition is forest defoliators. If their larvae can find shelter and food then survival is possible, but {{when all the}} foliage is destroyed then the population decreases. Their synchronized life cycle increases competition for specific resources this greatly affects their ability to receive resources including food and shelter due to the overwhelming population increase at certain times of the year. [...] Scramble competition {{can also be seen}} with the example of red <b>spotted</b> <b>newts.</b> Charles Darwin (1871) first explored the concept of “sexual dimorphism” which states that, “most sexually dimorphic species are also the most polygynous” which would enable males to “outcompete other males through female choice, combat, or scrambles to encounter females would be favored by selection, and sexual dimorphism would result”. The key to red-spotted newts increased success in scramble competition is the newts enhanced or strengthened tailfins.|$|R
50|$|These larvae {{are used}} {{extensively}} as live food for terrarium pets and some pet birds, mostly {{due to their}} high fat content, their ease of breeding, {{and their ability to}} survive for weeks at low temperatures. Most commonly, they are used to feed reptiles such as bearded dragons (species in the genus Pogona), the neon tree dragon (Japalura splendida), geckos, brown anole (Anolis sagrei), turtles such as the three-toed box turtle (Terrapene carolina triunguis), and chameleons. They can also be fed to amphibians such as Ceratophrys frogs, newts such as the Strauch's <b>spotted</b> <b>newt</b> (Neurergus strauchii), and salamanders such as axolotls. Small mammals such as the domesticated hedgehog can also be fed with waxworms, while birds such as the greater honeyguide can also appreciate the food. They can also be used as food for captive predatory insects reared in terrarium, such as assassin bugs in the genus Platymeris, and are also occasionally used to feed certain kinds of fish in the wild, such as bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus).|$|R
40|$|Lens {{regeneration}} {{studies in}} the adult newt suggest that molecular aspects of lens regeneration are complete within 5 weeks of lentectomy. However, very {{little is known about}} the optical properties of the regenerated lens. In an aquatic environment, the lens accounts for almost all of the refractive power of the eye, and thus, a fully functional lens is critical. We compared the optical properties of 9 - and 26 -week regenerated lenses in the red <b>spotted</b> <b>newt,</b> Notophthalmus viridescens, with the original lenses removed from the same eyes. At 9 weeks, the regenerated lenses are smaller than the original lenses and are histologically immature, with a lower density of lens proteins. The 9 week lenses have greater light transmission, but significantly reduced focal length and refractive index than the original lenses. This suggests that following 9 weeks of regeneration, the lenses have not recovered the functionality of the original lens. By 26 weeks, the transmission of light in the more mature lens is reduced, but the optical parameters of the lens have recovered enough to allow functional vision...|$|R
40|$|Unlike mammals, adult {{salamanders}} can regenerate {{their brain}} after injury {{in a process}} fuelled by neurogenesis. The aim of this thesis is to identify the cells {{that give rise to}} new neurons after injury and examine the mechanisms controlling the initiation and termination of brain regeneration in the newt. The reasons why newts can regenerate their brain while mammals cannot are unknown, and {{it has been argued that}} the presence of constantly proliferating cells is a prerequisite for regeneration to occur. In Paper I of this thesis we mapped the distribution of proliferating cells in the adult newt brain and identified the areas of the brain where neurons are added under normal conditions. We observed that similarly to mammals, neurons are continuously added to the newt forebrain, while no neurogenesis was detected in the midbrain. After injury to the newt midbrain, radial glia-like cells (RGLs) start to proliferate and progeny of these cells differentiate into neurons. These results show that regeneration is not dependent on constitutive neurogenesis. In Paper II we wanted to test if the neurotransmitter dopamine is involved in controlling regeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. We found that synthetically increasing the concentration of dopamine in the regenerating newt brain by administration of the dopamine precursor L-dopa, inhibits regeneration by blocking the proliferation of the progenitor cells. We also found that antagonizing dopamine signalling in the uninjured brain is sufficient to evoke proliferation of the otherwise quiescent RGLs and we found that progeny of these cells give rise to increased numbers of neurons in the midbrain. The newt is not the only vertebrate animal able to regenerate its brain; both fish and reptile species can repair injured brain. Interestingly, fish and reptiles are also able to survive hypoxia and are exposed to these conditions in their natural habitat. In Paper III of my thesis we wanted to examine if the ability to regenerate brain tissue is linked to an animal’s ability to survive varying levels of oxygen. We observed that the red <b>spotted</b> <b>newt</b> is able to survive hypoxia, but this treatment leads to increased cell death in the brain. Reoxygenation of the brain leads to an elevated production of reactive oxygen species, which is concomitant with an increase in proliferation of the ventricular progenitor cells, suggesting that a regenerative process has been initiated. Inhibiting production of reactive oxygen species during reoxygenation results in reduced progenitor cell proliferation. The major findings of this thesis are summarized as follows: the red <b>spotted</b> <b>newt</b> is able to regenerate areas of the brain that are normally devoid of proliferating cells. In this process, ventricular RGLs act as progenitor cells in the adult newt brain and give rise to new neurons after injury. We have also shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine inhibits the proliferation of DA progenitor cells in a feedback-like manner and thus identified a mechanism for how the brain senses the degree of neuronal loss. These results pinpoint several features of naturally occurring brain regeneration and could aid the development of techniques to evoke brain regeneration in humans. Finally we have found that the newt, similarly to other animals capable of brain regeneration, is able to survive hypoxia. Hypoxia leads to increased cell death in the brain, but molecules that are activated by reoxygenation induce regenerative mechanisms such as increased proliferation of neural progenitor cells. These discoveries suggest that the trait of brain regeneration has evolved together with the capacity to survive variation in oxygen levels...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Dedifferentiation, {{a process}} whereby {{differentiated}} cells lose their specialized characteristics and revert {{to a less}} differentiated state, {{plays a key role}} in the regeneration process in urodele amphibians such as the red <b>spotted</b> <b>newt,</b> Notophthalmus viridescens. Dedifferentiation of fully mature tissues is generally absent in mammalian cells. Previous studies have shown that mouse C 2 C 12 multinucleated myotubes treated with extract derived from regenerating newt forelimbs can re-enter the cell cycle, fragment into mononucleated cells, and proliferate. However, this response has been difficult to replicate. Methods We isolated extract from early newt forelimb regenerates and assessed its effects on differentiation of proliferating primary and C 2 C 12 myoblasts. We also treated fully differentiated primary and C 2 C 12 myotube cultures with extract and assessed cell cycle re-entry and myotube fragmentation. Results We have confirmed the results obtained in C 2 C 12 cells and expanded these studies to also examine the effects of newt regeneration extracts on primary muscle cells. Newt extract can block differentiation of both C 2 C 12 and primary myoblasts. Once differentiation is induced, treatment with newt extract causes cell cycle re-entry and fragmentation of C 2 C 12 myotubes. Downregulation of p 21 and muscle-specific markers is also induced. Primary myotubes also fragment in response to extract treatment, and the fragmented cells remain viable for long periods of time in culture. However, unlike C 2 C 12 cells, primary muscle cells do not re-enter the cell cycle in response to treatment with newt extracts. Conclusions Dedifferentiation of fully mature muscle occurs during regeneration in the newt forelimb to contribute cells to the regeneration process. Our study shows that extracts derived from regenerating newt forelimbs can induce dedifferentiation, cell cycle re-entry, and fragmentation of mouse C 2 C 12 cells but can only induce fragmentation in primary muscle cells...|$|R
40|$|AbstractImmediately {{following}} amputation of {{the limb}} in salamanders, a strong, steady, and polarized flow of ionic current {{is produced by}} the injury. Current flows in a proximodistal direction within the limb stump and {{is associated with a}} fall in electrical potential of about 50 mV/mm near the stump's end. This current is electrogenically driven by the Na+-dependent, internally positive transcutaneous voltage of the intact skin of the limb stump. Reduction of this EMF, the skin's battery, by topical application of Na+blocking agents leads to inhibition or disruption of normal limb regeneration. This suggests electrical factors are a critical control of limb regeneration. Here we test another means to reduce the injury current and its associated electrical field within the forelimb stump of red <b>spotted</b> <b>newts.</b> A fine (40 gauge), insulated, multistrand wire was inserted beneath the skin of the animal's back, with the uninsulated portion terminating either at the shoulder region or {{at the base of the}} tail. When this cathodal (negative) electrode is connected to a regulated current source, sufficient current was pulled into the stump end from an external anode (placed in the water the animal was immersed in) to markedly reduce or null the endogenous current for the first 8 days following amputation. The extent of limb regeneration in sham-treated and experimentally treated animals was determined 1 month following amputation at the elbow. Sham-treated animals regenerated normally, with most producing digits within this time. Limb regeneration was completely arrested, or caused to be strikingly hypomorphic, in half of the experimentally treated animals. This effect was independent of where the subcutaneous electrode was placed and suggests that electrical (physiological) factors are indeed a critical control of limb regeneration in urodeles...|$|R
40|$|Salamanders {{such as the}} red <b>spotted</b> <b>newt</b> Notophthalamus viridescens and the axolotl Ambystoma mexicanum {{regenerate}} {{a number}} of anatomical structures following injury. Prod 1 is believed to guide patterning processes operating during limb regeneration, however the molecular mechanism through which it operates is unclear. Being glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored, Prod 1 does not make {{direct contact with the}} cytoplasm, raising questions as to how it functions in the transfer of information across the cell membrane. The transmembrane epidermal growth factor receptor was shown to associate with Prod 1, initiating MAPK signalling and resulting in the induction of matrix metalloprotease 9 expression (MMP 9). MMP 9 is known to be rapidly upregulated in the hours following amputation in the wound epithelium, a structure essential for regeneration formed by the migration of epidermal cells {{across the surface of the}} amputation plane. Patches of newt limb skin explanted into culture were used as a model for this process. A sheet of cells expressing MMP 9 was seen to migrate out from skin patches, and this was shown to be sensitive to MMP inhibitors. Further to this, upregulation of MMP 9 was seen to occur in the dermis of explanted skin patches, a layer of the skin known to be instructive to the patterning of the limb. The relationship of Prod 1 s structure to its MMP 9 inducing function was investigated through the creation of a series of point mutants, and it was shown that amino acids located on the α-helix of the protein were essential for this function. Axolotl Prod 1 lacks a GPI anchor, however despite the requirement of newt Prod 1 for GPI anchorage in order to induce MMP 9 expression in either newt or axolotl cells, axolotl Prod 1 was fully functional in cells from either species. There was some indication that amino acids on the α-helix may confer this ability to axolotl Prod 1...|$|R

40|$|Rapid {{developments}} in genomics and transcriptomics fields {{have made it}} possible to ask new questions as well as solve various old problems in biology that were not achievable previously. Novel techniques such as RNA sequencing and Hi-C became available at the time I started my PhD. Therefore, in order to study regeneration in salamanders and genome-wide regulatory interactions in mouse embryonic stem cells, my first goals were to make use of these techniques. Regeneration in salamanders has not been fully understood despite being studied for a few centuries. One of the reasons was the scarcity of genomic data. We mainly solved this problem by providing a high-quality transcriptome of red <b>spotted</b> <b>newt,</b> using latest tools (Paper I). Combining Hi-C with promoter capture probes increased the resolution for finding regulatory interactions, mainly promoter-enhancer (distal element). One of the surprising discoveries was enhancer-enhancer interactions, which was actually due to imperfect promoter capture efficiency. Our method, HiCap (Paper II), had a highest resolution for locating enhancers, yet had a modest improvement over assigning enhancers to their closest gene. Further analysis of regulatory networks showed a strong connectivity of enhancers and promoters individually than promoter-enhancers together. My last two projects involved studying gene regulation at a single cell level. The role of small RNAs in gene regulation in individual cells was not studied at that time. Aiming to shed a light on this, we developed a single-cell method for small RNAs, where I performed all the computational analysis (Paper III). This novel method, Small-seq, mainly revealed that microRNAs could be used to cluster different cell types. Since almost all of the available singlecell methods quantify polyadenylated RNAs (mainly mRNAs), Small-seq showed that one can get equally good clustering of cells using an order of magnitude less number of genes (about 200 microRNAs in human embryonic stem cells compared to a few thousand mRNAs). By making use of the newt transcriptome from Paper I, we aim to decipher the cellular composition of blastema – a small bud of cell mass formed on the amputation surface of regenerating newt limb. Adult newt limbs, upon amputation, undergo a precisely controlled “magic” of regenerating fully functional copy of its original limb. Newt cells are shown to dedifferentiate back to progenitor-like cellular state, populate and differentiate back to necessary cell types. The extend of this dedifferentiation and which cells contribute and how much is unknown. In paper IV, we have studied limb regeneration in newt and identified 8 cell types in blastema, where one cell type has significantly enriched for transposable elements, DNA fragments that are able to change their genomic positions, and has been shown to {{play a critical role in}} stem cell pluripotency, disease and development. Overall, this thesis covers studies of gene regulation in regeneration and several types of stem cells, both at an individual cell level as well as using millions of cells, by applying latest experimental and computational methods...|$|R
