25|$|SAMs {{are also}} useful in {{depositing}} nanostructures, because each adsorbate molecule can {{be tailored to}} attract two different materials. Current techniques utilize the head to attract to a surface, like a plate of gold.

In this way, wherever the a SAM is patterned to a surface there will be nanostructures attached to the tail groups. One example {{is the use of}} two types of SAMs to align single wall carbon nanotubes, SWNTs. <b>Dip</b> <b>pen</b> <b>nanolithography</b> was used to pattern a 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHA)SAM {{and the rest of the}} surface was passivated with 1-octadecanethiol (ODT) SAM. The polar solvent that is carrying the SWNTs is attracted to the hydrophilic MHA; as the solvent evaporates, the SWNTs are close enough to the MHA SAM to attach to it due to Van der Waals forces.

50|$|A <b>dip</b> <b>pen</b> has a steel nib (the pen proper) and a {{pen-holder}}. <b>Dip</b> <b>pens</b> {{are very}} versatile, as the pen-holder can accommodate {{a wide variety}} of nibs that are specialized for different purposes: copperplate writing, mapping pens, and five-pointed nibs for drawing music staves. They can be used with most types of ink, some of which are incompatible with other types of pen. Automatic pens are a category of <b>dip</b> <b>pen,</b> in which the nib is in two parts and can hold a larger quantity of ink.

5000|$|A <b>dip</b> <b>pen</b> (or nib pen) {{consists}} of a metal nib with capillary channels, {{like that of a}} fountain pen, mounted on a handle or holder, often made of wood. A <b>dip</b> <b>pen</b> usually has no ink reservoir and must be repeatedly recharged with ink while drawing or writing. The <b>dip</b> <b>pen</b> has certain advantages over a fountain pen. It can use waterproof pigmented (particle-and-binder-based) inks, such as so-called India ink, drawing ink, or acrylic inks, which would destroy a fountain pen by clogging, as well as the traditional iron gall ink, which can cause corrosion in a fountain <b>pen.</b> <b>Dip</b> <b>pens</b> are now mainly used in illustration, calligraphy, and comics.

5000|$|<b>Dip</b> <b>pen</b> <b>nanolithography</b> (DPN) is a {{scanning}} probe lithography technique where an {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) tip is used to create patterns directly {{on a range of}} substances with a variety of inks.

The tail groups can be modified so they have an affinity for cells, proteins, or molecules. The SAM can then be placed onto a biosensor so that binding of these molecules can be detected. The ability to pattern these SAMs allows them to be placed in configurations that increase sensitivity and do not damage or interfere with other components of the biosensor.|$|E

The test results concluded that the kinematic fixturing system has a 1 -[sigma] repeatability of approximately 50 nanometers and 3. 5 microradians.

40|$|Over 100 {{years of}} {{manufacturing}} {{knowledge and experience}} are available to a design engineer when considering the integration of a machine tool enabling macro-scale processes (milling, turning, welding, water-jet cutting) into a production or manufacturing line, and this thesis seeks to provide a design engineer with the insight so that {{the same can be}} done for a nano-scale process such as <b>Dip</b> <b>Pen</b> <b>Nanolithography</b> and Nanoimprint Lithography. Accordingly this work presents methods for designing nanomanufacturing systems, including the development of new technology to fulfill the unique performance requirements of nanomanufacturing processes. First, an introduction to nanomanufacturing and the differences between macro-scale and nano-scale manufacturing will be presented. Second, a "metric mapping" method will be illustrated which can be used to identify areas of nano-manufacturing where the need for the development of new technology is critical. Thirdly, this new method is capable of helping a design engineer synthesize technology for nano-manufacturing, as will be shown through a case-study in which a modular, precision belt-drive machine which is capable of enabling high-throughput nanomanufacturing was designed and built. This machine for highrate nanomanufacturing not only exceeds the performance requirements for a process (<b>Dip</b> <b>Pen</b> <b>Nanolithography,</b> or DPN) that has been called "not suitable for high-rate nanomanufacturing", but also is capable of implementing DPN at a rate almost 200 times that of previous machines. by Alexander H.
