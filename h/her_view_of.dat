5|$|Among {{the most}} famous anti-Tom books are The Sword and the Distaff by William Gilmore Simms, Aunt Phillis's Cabin by Mary Henderson Eastman, and The Planter's Northern Bride by Caroline Lee Hentz, with the last author having been a close {{personal}} friend of Stowe's when the two lived in Cincinnati. Simms' book was published {{a few months after}} Stowe's novel, and it contains a number of sections and discussions disputing Stowe's book and <b>her</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> slavery. Hentz's 1854 novel, widely read at the time but now largely forgotten, offers a defense of slavery as seen {{through the eyes of a}} northern woman—the daughter of an abolitionist, no less—who marries a southern slave owner.|$|E
5|$|The former Town Hall, {{adjoining}} the old marketplace, {{houses the}} Willis Museum (originally the Basingstoke Museum, until 1956). This was founded {{and directed by}} Alderman George W. Willis, a local clocksmith, who served as Mayor of Basingstoke in 1923-24. He established the museum in 1931 and with much public support was able to build it up into a major collection on local history, with a particularly extensive collection (largely made by him) of prehistoric implements and of antique clocks and watches. His association with the expanding museum continued for forty years. Its central location today is where, once upon a time, Jane Austen and her sister {{used to go to}} dances. Although ostensibly set in Hertford, Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, written in 1797, is thought to have been based on <b>her</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Basingstoke society two centuries ago.|$|E

25|$|The equestrian {{statue of}} Peter the Great is {{situated}} in the Senate Square (formerly the Decembrists Square), in Saint Petersburg. Catherine the Great, a German princess who married into the Romanov line, was anxious to connect herself to Peter the Great to gain legitimacy {{in the eyes of}} the people. She ordered its construction, and had it inscribed with the phrase Petro Primo Catharina Secunda MDCCLXXXII in Latin and Петру перьвому Екатерина вторая, лѣта 1782 in Russian, both meaning 'Catherine the Second to Peter the First, 1782', an expression of her admiration for her predecessor and <b>her</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> her own place in the line of great Russian rulers. Having gained her position through a palace coup, Catherine had no legal claim to the throne and wanted to represent herself as Peter's rightful heir.|$|E

500|$|Angela Breitenbach, {{looking at}} the {{question}} of teleology in biology from a Kantian perspective, argues that teleology is important as [...] "a heuristic {{in the search for}} causal explanations of nature and... an inevitable analogical perspective on living beings." [...] In <b>her</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Kant, teleology implies something that cannot be explained by science, but only understood through analogy.|$|E
500|$|David {{emphasised}} {{the importance}} to cooks of careful and knowledgeable shopping for ingredients. She [...] wrote chapters about French markets {{such as those}} at Cavaillon, Yvetot, Montpellier, Martigues and Valence. Despite a widespread perception that <b>her</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> food was essentially Mediterranean, French Provincial Cooking, by far her longest to date, surveyed the cuisine of France from Normandy and the Île-de-France to Alsace, Burgundy, the Loire, Bordeaux and the Basque Country, {{as well as the}} south. Looking at the entire field of cookery books, Jane Grigson regarded this [...] as [...] "the best and most stimulating of them all".|$|E

500|$|Roger Sutton from Horn Book Magazine {{felt that}} the moment Marcus {{explains}} this flaw to Miranda is the first exchange that shows the novel to be complicated and mysterious. Quattlebaum noted, [...] "The story's structure– an expert interweaving of past, present and future– brilliantly contradicts Miranda's commonsensical belief that the end can't happen before the middle." [...] Stead explained <b>her</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> time travel in her novel, where going back in time is fulfilling the future, rather than changing it. She hoped to make the time travel element logical to show that [...] "Miranda wasn't struggling to understand the seeming randomness and infinity of the universe, but learning that her world has value and that people do care about her".|$|E
500|$|Narratively, Kreia {{had several}} roles in The Sith Lords, {{acting as a}} party member, a foil, and a [...] "sounding board" [...] for {{the theme of the}} game, which {{concerned}} the Jedi's role and the Force's nature in a living galaxy. As an extension of Avellone's voice, Kreia became his way of expressing all his problems with the Force. Despite <b>her</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the Force, it was important to avoid causing continuity problems {{with the rest of the}} Star Wars series, and her views were presented within the context of the original Force in the Star Wars world. Kreia is intended to test the player on the basic philosophical issues of the Star Wars universe. She is rude and dismissive to everyone but the player character, something intended to help make the player feel special.|$|E
500|$|On 11 May 1904, {{the society}} {{formally}} accepted Horniman's offer {{of the use}} of the building. As Horniman was not normally resident in Ireland, the Royal Letters Patent required were paid for by her but granted in the name of Lady Gregory. One of her own plays, Spreading the News, was performed on the opening night, 27 December 1904. At the opening of Synge's The Playboy of the Western World in January 1907, {{a significant portion of the}} crowd rioted, causing the remainder of the performances to be acted out in dumbshow. Lady Gregory did not think as highly of the play as Yeats did, but she defended Synge as a matter of principle. <b>Her</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the affair is summed up in a letter to Yeats where she wrote of the riots: [...] "It is the old battle, between those who use a toothbrush and those who don't." ...|$|E

500|$|Christian Science {{theology}} differs {{in several}} respects {{from that of}} traditional Christianity. Eddy's Science and Health reinterprets key Christian concepts, including the Trinity, divinity of Jesus, atonement and resurrection; from the 1883 edition she included a glossary that redefined the Christian vocabulary, and added with a Key to the Scriptures to the title. At the core of Eddy's theology is {{the view that the}} spiritual world is the only reality and is entirely good, and that the material world, with its evil, sickness and death, is an illusion. Eddy saw humanity as an [...] "idea of Mind" [...] that is [...] "perfect, eternal, unlimited, and reflects the divine," [...] according to Bryan Wilson; what she called [...] "mortal man" [...] is simply humanity's distorted view of itself. Despite <b>her</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the non-existence of evil, an important element of Christian Science theology is that evil thought, in the form of malicious animal magnetism, can cause harm, even if the harm is only apparent.|$|E
500|$|The story's central {{location}} {{was set at}} Steventon rectory where Austen was raised. While it had been demolished in 1824, Jarrold and his crew [...] "fortunately found a wonderful house that was very like the original... We honed the script as well {{to make it as}} practical as possible." [...] Stewart believed that the Austen house expressed their status and wealth, [...] "I think that you will lose the central thrust of the story unless you understand the status of the Austen's and that they are pretty poor. Jane spent all her formative years there and that was the place that influenced <b>her</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the world. You have to believe that the family live in that house because that is a crucial piece of the jigsaw." [...] Scenes at Steventon rectory were filmed in Higginsbrook House, a few miles off Trim in County Meath. Later in fall 2006, it appeared again as the house of the Morlands in Northanger Abbey.|$|E
500|$|To {{the right}} of Queen Charlotte, HMS Brunswick had {{initially}} struggled to join the action. Labouring behind the flagship, her captain John Harvey received a rebuke from Howe for the delay. Spurred by this signal, Harvey pushed his ship forward and almost outstripped Queen Charlotte, blocking <b>her</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> {{the eastern half of}} the French fleet for a time and taking severe damage from French fire as she did so. Harvey hoped to run aboard Jacobin and support his admiral directly, but was not fast enough to reach her and so attempted to cut between Achille and Vengeur du Peuple. This manoeuvre failed when Brunswick's anchors became entangled in Vengeur's rigging. Harvey's master asked if Vengeur should be cut loose, to which Harvey replied [...] "No; we have got her and we will keep her". The two ships swung so close to each other that Brunswick's crew could not open their gunports and had to fire through the closed lids, the ships battering each other from a distance of just a few feet.|$|E

6000|$|... "Her {{views on}} the subject were perhaps {{somewhat}} beclouded by the extreme convenience she found {{in being able to}} go into company, and to range about the city at all hours, unembarrassed by those family cares which generally fall to the mistress, but which <b>her</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> what constituted general usefulness devolved upon me.|$|R
500|$|Central to Franklin's pacifism and <b>her</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> life is {{what she}} calls [...] "the Quaker vision of the world". Individual {{conscience}} {{is at the heart}} of that vision. So too, is the need to discern appropriate ways of working for peace in each time and place [...] "rather than relying on a dogma of unvarying rules of conduct". She notes that for more than 300 years, Quakers have opposed war and violence and have objected to military service and conscription. They have worked on reconciliation, peace research and disarmament and in many countries have won the right for conscientious objectors to perform alternative service instead of taking part in war. Franklin remarks that Quaker principles have not changed, but technology has changed the nature of war. In a modern technological society she argues, there is no longer a clear boundary between war and peace. War planning is constant during peacetime and when wars are fought, women and children become targets. Nations no longer depend primarily on conscripting military recruits, but rely on advanced weapons systems that are costly to build or acquire. She writes that the arms race is driven by a [...] "technological imperative" [...] which requires the creation of an enemy as a permanent social institution: ...|$|E
