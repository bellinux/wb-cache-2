40|$|This NETL {{sponsored}} effort {{seeks to}} develop continuous technologies {{for the production}} of carbon products, which may be thought of as the heavier products currently produced from refining of crude petroleum and coal tars obtained from metallurgical <b>grade</b> <b>coke</b> ovens. This effort took binder grade pitch, produced from liquefaction of West Virginia bituminous grade coal, all the way to commercial demonstration in a state of the art arc furnace. Other products, such as crude oil, anode <b>grade</b> <b>coke</b> and metallurgical <b>grade</b> <b>coke</b> were demonstrated successfully at the bench scale. The technology developed herein diverged from the previous state of the art in direct liquefaction (also referred to as the Bergius process), in two major respects. First, direct liquefaction was accomplished with less than a percent of hydrogen per unit mass of product, or about 3 pound per barrel or less. By contrast, other variants of the Bergius process require the use of 15 pounds or more of hydrogen per barrel, resulting in an inherent materials cost. Second, the conventional Bergius process requires high pressure, in the range of 1500 psig to 3000 psig. The WVU process variant has been carried out at pressures below 400 psig, a significant difference. Thanks mainly to DOE sponsorship, the WVU process has been licensed to a Canadian Company, Quantex Energy Inc, with a commercial demonstration unit plant scheduled to be erected in 2011...|$|R

40|$|Carbon anodes are {{essential}} when producing aluminium. Oxygen from dissolved aluminium oxide reacts electrochemically on the carbon anode forming CO 2. The carbon anode is consumed during the process. The production of aluminium happens {{according to the}} electrochemical reaction: 2 Al 2 O 3 (diss) + 3 C (s) = 4 Al (l) + 3 CO 2 (g) Carbon anodes are produced from calcined petroleum coke and a pitch binder. Anisotropic sponge coke was traditionally used as anode grade coke; however, the increased production of aluminium {{in the world has}} led to an increase in the demand for anode <b>grade</b> <b>coke.</b> Isotropic coke that was previously graded as fuel <b>grade</b> <b>coke</b> is being tested as anode <b>grade</b> <b>coke</b> in blends by some smelters around the world. In this work a series of pilot anodes have been made where the effect of blending isotropic coke into anisotropic coke was investigated. The pilot anodes were investigated both through characterisation techniques and electrochemical performance. Isotropic coke is higher in impurities (especially metals like vanadium and nickel, and sulfur) than many anisotropic sponge cokes and the increased impurity level can impose problems in the pot rooms. Also, the coefficient of thermal expansion between the two cokes is very different and this will cause increased cracking of anodes containing a certain level of isotropic coke. Cracking was observed in pilot anodes containing 35. 0 wt% and 49. 0 wt% isotropic coke. However, electrochemical testing showed that the introduction of isotropic coke to the pilot anodes proved positive in reducing the anodic reaction overpotential and also reducing the voltage oscillations caused by gas bubbles. Reducing the reaction overpotential can give a reduction in the energy consumption of the overall process, and reduction in voltage oscillations during bubble build-up and release will give more stable pots. It was also found that the wettability between the anode and the electrolyte was improved when isotropic coke was present. It is reasonable to assume a correlation between the reduction in voltage oscillations and improved wettability between anode and electrolyte. The effect of the production parameters mixing temperature between pitch and coke, and baking temperature was also investigated in pilot anodes. A pilot anode line was prepared where the mixing and baking temperatures were varied: a high and a low mixing temperature and a medium and a low baking temperature. The electrochemical effect of varying these anode production parameters was small. However, the mixing temperature proved very important in order to produce homogeneous and dense anodes where the pitch had penetrated the coke well...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} scale delayed coking process {{was used to}} produce petrol precursors, diesel precursors, methane rich gas, green and calcined coke from five previously untested South African heavy petroleum residues. The ash content of the heavy petroleum residues {{was found to be}} detrimental to the microstructure of the green coke and Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) of the calcined coke. The sulphur content of the calcined cokes produced was found to be in-line with typical global anode <b>grade</b> <b>cokes.</b> De-ashing of the feedstock would be necessary to produce anode grade fillers for the aluminium industry. The local production of anode <b>grade</b> <b>coke</b> would serve to reduce imports and supply the aluminium smelters on the east coast of South Africa. The heavy petroleum residues (also known as heavy fuel oil) are currently used as bunker fuel in the shipping industry and are responsible for substantial air pollution. Delayed coking of these residues could extend the production of petrol and diesel per barrel of imported crude oil and reduce the effect on South Africa’s balance of payments deficit and impact the environment in a beneficial manner with respect to carbon dioxide and sulphur emissions. The research also evaluated the replacement of heavy fuel oil with marine diesel produced by delayed coking of the former. Marine diesel was found to emit less sulphur oxides and have a higher energy density per unit of carbon dioxide emitted. While seawater scrubbing of the heavy fuel oil would be more cost effective in reducing the sulphur oxide emissions, it would not contribute to carbon dioxide reductions. The research created a hypothetical scenario to determine the required value of Clean Development Mechanism credits for a marine diesel replacement, were shipping to be incorporated under the Kyoto Protocol in futur...|$|R

40|$|In {{aluminium}} reduction cells, carbon anodes {{are used for}} electrolysis. Petroleum coke is {{the primary source of}} material used in the manufacture of these anodes. There is a trend of falling quality of petroleum coke and the level of impurities is also increasing. This is particularly concerning to the aluminium industry because this reduces the anode performance, contributes to corrosive gases in the exhaust stream, and contaminates the aluminium metal product. These supply issues, combined with an increased awareness and preparedness to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, opens the aluminium industry to the possibility of replacing fossil-based carbon anodes with low ash, renewable carbon based biocoke. The biocoke is to be used for making anodes known as 'bio-anodes' (de Vries et al., 2009).

40|$|This Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory {{sponsored}} project developed carbon products, using mildly hydrogenated solvents {{to extract}} the organic portion of coal to create synthetic pitches, cokes, carbon foam and carbon fibers. The focus of this effort was on development of lower cost solvents, milder hydrogenation conditions and improved yield in order to enable practical production of these products. This technology is needed because of the long-term decline in production of domestic feedstocks such as petroleum pitch and coal tar pitch. Currently, carbon products represents a market of roughly 5 million tons domestically, and 19 million tons worldwide. Carbon products are mainly derived from feedstocks such as petroleum pitch and coal tar pitch. The domestic supply of petroleum pitch is declining because of the rising price of liquid fuels, which has caused US refineries to maximize liquid fuel production. As a consequence, the long term trend has a decline in production of petroleum pitch over the past 20 years. The production of coal tar pitch, {{as in the case}} of petroleum pitch, has likewise declined significantly over the past two decades. Coal tar pitch is a byproduct of metallurgical <b>grade</b> <b>coke</b> (metcoke) production. In this industry, modern metcoke facilities are recycling coal tar as fuel in order to enhance energy efficiency and minimize environmental emissions. Metcoke production itself is dependent upon the production requirements for domestic steel. Hence, several metcoke ovens have been decommissioned over the past two decades and have not been replaced. As a consequence sources of coal tar are being taken off line and are not being replaced. The long-term trend is a reduction in coal tar pitch production. Thus import of feedstocks, mainly from Eastern Europe and China, is on the rise despite the relatively large transportation cost. To reverse this trend, a new process for producing carbon products is needed. The process must be economically competitive with current processes, and yet be environmentally friendly as well. The solvent extraction process developed uses mild hydrogenation of low cost oils to create powerful solvents that can dissolve the organic portion of coal. The insoluble portion, consisting mainly of mineral matter and fixed carbon, is removed via centrifugation or filtration, leaving a liquid solution of coal chemicals and solvent. This solution can be further refined via distillation to meet specifications for products such as synthetic pitches, cokes, carbon foam and fibers. The most economical process recycles 85 % of the solvent, which itself is obtained as a low-cost byproduct from industrial processes such as coal tar or petroleum refining. Alternatively, processes have been developed that can recycle 100 % of the solvent, avoiding any need for products derived from petroleum or coal tar...|$|R
40|$|Iron in the United States {{is largely}} {{produced}} from iron ore mined in the United States or imported from Canada or South America. The iron ore is typically smelted in Blast Furnaces that use primarily iron ore, iron concentrate pellets metallurgical coke, limestone and lime as the raw materials. Under current operating scenarios, the iron produced from these Blast Furnaces is relatively inexpensive {{as compared to}} current alternative iron sources, e. g. direct iron reduction, imported pig iron, etc. The primary problem the Blast Furnace Ironmaking approach {{is that many of}} these Blast furnaces are relatively small, as compared to the newer, larger Blast Furnaces; thus are relatively costly and inefficient to operate. An additional problem is also that supplies of high-grade metallurgical <b>grade</b> <b>coke</b> are becoming increasingly in short supply and costs are also increasing. In part {{this is due to the}} short supply and costs of high-grade metallurgical coals, but also this is due to the increasing necessity for environmental controls for coke production. After year 2003 new regulations for coke product environmental requirement will likely be promulgated. It is likely that this also will either increase the cost of high-quality coke production or will reduce the available domestic U. S. supply. Therefore, iron production in the United States utilizing the current, predominant Blast Furnace process will be more costly and would likely be curtailed due to a coke shortage. Therefore, there is a significant need to develop or extend the economic viability of Alternate Ironmaking Processes to at least partially replace current and declining blast furnace iron sources and to provide incentives for new capacity expansion. The primary conclusions of this comparative Study of Alternative Ironmaking Process scenarios are: (1) The processes with the best combined economics (CAPEX and OPEX impacts in the I. R. R. calculation) can be grouped into those Fine Ore based processes with no scrap charge and those producing Hot Metal for charge to the EAF. (2) A pronounced sensitivity to Steel Scrap Cost was felt less by the Hot Metal Processes and the Fine Ore Processes that typically do not utilize much purchased scrap. (3) In terms of evolving processes, the Tecnored Process (and in particular, the lower-operating cost process with integral co-generation of electrical power) was in the most favorable groupings at all scrap cost sensitivities. (4) It should be noted also that the Conventional Blast Furnace process utilizing Non-Recovery coke (from a continuous coking process with integral co-generation of electrical power) and the lower-capital cost Mini Blast Furnace also showed favorable Relative Economics for the low and median Scrap Cost sensitivities. (5) The lower-cost, more efficient MauMee Rotary Hearth Process that uses a Briquetted Iron Unit Feed (instead of a dried or indurated iron ore pellet) also was in the most favorable process groupings. Those processes with lower-cost raw materials (i. e. fine ore and/or nonmetallurgical coal as the reductant) had favorable combined economics. In addition, the hot metal processes (in part due to the sensible heat impacts in the EAF and due to their inherently lower costs) also had favorable combined economics...|$|R
40|$|More than 50 % of {{hot metal}} {{production}} worldwide {{takes place in}} blast furnaces. Coke {{is the most expensive}} raw material in the blast furnace. It acts as the burden support as well as heat source and reductant in the blast furnace. As technology advances, supplementary fuels can supply heat and reduce the iron oxides, but coke would always be needed as burden support. Blast furnaces have been using coke for the past century and will continue to use coke for the next few decades. The price of coke is determined by its quality. Strict environmental laws and regulations in the USA pushed coke-making technology since the early 1990 s towards the beehive type of oven. Gas collected during the coke cycle is used to supply heat to the process. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the spatial variation and coke quality in the non-recovery ovens and provide an explanation for it. The original coal was tested and samples of the coke were obtained from the top, bottom and sides of a coke oven. The samples were prepared and submitted for image analysis to determine the porosity, cell wall thickness and pore diameter. The samples were also submitted for a microscopical point counting to determine the micro textures of the coke. The coke was further submitted for the coke strength after reaction testing (CSR). The results show clear variation in the coke and a model of the behavior of the gas inside the coke oven during the carbonization process was developed based on the results of the tests. The model shows the flow of gas from the bottom of the oven up along the sidewalls to escape from the coke charge through the top. The flow of gas enriched the coke on the side of the oven by deposition of pyrolitic carbon to create an ultra-high <b>grade</b> of <b>coke</b> that could physically be separated from the rest of the coke and be sold separately at a higher price.

40|$|A Final ReportThe pellets {{produced}} by Minnesota taconite companies generally contain between 4. 0 and 7. 0 percent silica. These silica levels were established initially by the concentratability of the ore, that is, its response to closed circuit ball mill grinding and magnetic concentration. Those operations that had taconite {{that was easy}} to concentrate generally produced lower silica pellets. As processing technology improved and it became possible to achieve lower silica levels constraints imposed by the blast-furnace operation became limiting. These constraints related primarily to sulphur and alkali levels in the furnace which control both the volume and chemistry of the furnace slag. Because the trend in blast-furnace practice has been to move toward lower slag volumes, pellets with lower silica levels have become more desirable. Recent extensive installation of external hot metal desulphurization facilities at many steel works allows even lower slag volumes. The basic driving force to go to lower slag volumes is the cost and availability of high quality metallurgical <b>grade</b> <b>coke</b> and related environmental problems. The recent move to produce fluxed pellets has made lower pellet silica levels more attractive because of the lower palletizing costs related to both the lower flux addition and higher production rates with a lower silica content. A common target silica level in fluxed pellets is now about 4. 0 percent. A 4. 0 percent silica pellet requires a concentrate containing between 3. 7 and 3. 9 percent silica depending upon bentonite addition levels. This lower silica level has been accomplished in some plants {{by the use of}} fine screens, while other plants require the use of silica flotation. The lower silica level has been accomplished at a relatively small incremental cost, generally less than $ 0. 50 per ton. With increasing pressure from the blast furnaces for lower-silica pellets to reduce coke consumption, concentrate silica levels on the order of 3. 0 percent may be common in the future. In addition to the need to produce a lower silica blast-furnace feed, there is a potential need to produce even lower silica concentrates, below 3. 0 percent, as feed stock for direct steelmaking. Worldwide the current research emphasis is on the development of a coal-based direct-steelmaking process to replace the conventional two step, blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace, process. Most of the current prototype direct steel making processes would benefit from a lower silica feed. These low silica levels will require increasingly complex and expensive secondary treatment of normal magnetic concentrates which exceed the capability of current taconite processing flowsheets. The purpose of this test program is to establish the lower silica limits that can be achieved by current technology for various Minnesota taconites and gain a preliminary indication of the cost. Because the magnetite concentrates {{produced by}} different taconite plants range significantly in terms of their size-silica relationships the program included three different concentrate sources for evaluation. Major differences will exist between concentrates produced in a fully autogenous grinding system and those produced in a conventional rod mill-ball mill circuit in which the ball mills are closed with hydrocyclones and/or a combination of hydrocyclones and fine screens. There are also differences {{in the nature of the}} siliceous gangue minerals in the various operations. The concentrates from the western Mesabi range contain quartz and low- grade metamorphic iron silicates such as minnesotaite, stilpnomelane, and talc and iron carbonates. The concentrates from the east Mesabi metamorphosed iron formation contain high grade metamorphic iron silicates such as cummingtonite, grunerite, and fayalite as well as quartz. The type of gangue mineral greatly affects the ability to upgrade the concentrates by silica flotation. The purpose of this test program is to determine the lowest silica content that it is technically possible to produce from three different concentrate sources representing the east Mesabi metamorphosed iron formation (Erie), the unmetamorphosed central range produced in a rod mill and ball mill circuit (Minntac), and the unmetamorphosed western Mesabi produced in an autogenous milling circuit (Hibtac). Sufficient data were collected to allow preliminary cost estimates to be made at several silica levels. The cost estimates will be based on reagent consumption, regrind power and metal requirements, and iron recovery. This report contains all of the information obtained on the Erie samples. This includes the results of the initial characterization studies, basic bench scale beneficiation test results, pilot plant flotation data, and the results of the secondary and tertiary treatment of bulk flotation froth to improve overall iron recovery.

40|$|Eskom has {{embarked}} {{on the development of}} the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor to generate electricity at low cost compared to that of coal with no greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed PBMR requires about 600 tons of nuclear-grade graphite blocks in its construction. A considerable amount of pitch is required as impregnants for the manufacture of this graphite. Anthracene oil is a high-boiling coal-tar distillate fraction consisting of a complex mixture of mainly unsubstituted polyaromatic hydrocarbons, with some methyl substitution. Conversion to pitch may be effected by dehydrogenation, i. e. volatile oil molecules condensing together to yield material of high molecular mass. Two dehydrogenation reagents, elemental sulfur and a novel reagent, hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), an industrial waste product, were used to give three series of pitches with differing softening points. These products were characterised by standard pitch analyses, elemental analyses, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 HNMR), gas chromatography (GC), gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS), Maldi-TOF mass and mass probe spectrometry and then compared with commercial pitch <b>grades</b> from Mittal <b>Coke</b> and Chemicals. The results obtained showed that the reaction products reacted with 15 and 20 wt % of sulfur, with the softening points of 61. 3 and 91. 4 °C, would be suitable as commercial products. All pitches showed very little, if any, ash, making them suitable for use in the manufacture of high-purity graphite. Pitches prepared with 15 - 20 wt % of sulfur and HCH pitches may have more applications in impregnation because of their low QI content. Total sulfur content detected by elemental analysis is high. This is undesirable because sulfur may cause puffing which will result in poor quality of graphite. All pitches show very little, if any, ash, making them suitable for use in the manufacture of high-purity graphite. TGA results showed that pitches prepared with higher concentrations of sulfur can be suitably used as impregnants because of their high coking yields. The coking yields of HCH-derived pitches are lower than those of Mittal Coke and Chemicals commercial pitches. Results from the (1 HNMR showed that cross-linking on reaction with sulfur is through aliphatic carbon atoms; the percentages of aliphatic protons decrease with the increase in the sulfur concentration, and aromatic percentages increase. There is a slight increase in the proportion of aromatic protons of the HCH pitches; therefore cross linking is through aromatic-aromatic carbon atoms. Model reactions were prepared by reacting pure aromatic hydrocarbons with HCH, demonstrating the incorporation of the dehydrogenation reagent. These reactions were used to determine the reactivity of the main components of anthracene oil. The reaction products were characterised by Maldi-TOF and GC-MS. The results obtained from HCH pitches showed the formation of chlorobenzenes. This is undesirable because chlorine may cause corrosion of the equipment during coking.
