5000|$|... #Caption: Thermometer with Fahrenheit (marked on outer bezel) and Celsius (marked on inner <b>dial)</b> degree <b>units.</b> The Fahrenheit {{scale was}} the first {{standardized}} temperature scale to be widely used.|$|R
50|$|Right Guard is a {{brand of}} {{deodorant}} and shower gel for men. It is manufactured by the <b>Dial</b> Corporation <b>unit</b> of Henkel, which acquired the brand in 2006 {{as a condition for}} acquisition because P&G already owned the deodorant brands Sure and Old Spice.|$|R
40|$|Transformers play an {{important}} role in the efficient transmission of electricity. Regularmonitoring and maintenance can make it possible to detect new flaws before much damage has been done. Current systems can provide information about the state of a transformer, but they are either offline or veryexpensive to implement. This Monitoring system is primarily health monitoring equipment that can acquire,process, analyze & communicates the critical parameters to the concerned official who is at a remote placewith the help of Auto <b>dialing</b> <b>unit.</b> Not only the conventional technical data, such as current, voltage, etc., butalso other critical information such as frequency, oil temperature, oil level etc. of transformers is required bythe operators to ensure reliable power delivery and to assist the day-to-day decision making activities. Thus,the system increases the reliability of distribution network...|$|R
5000|$|... 5 dials, each {{coupled with}} an input key, are used to enter the {{operators}} with the rightmost <b>dial</b> representing <b>units.</b> Turning the units key one division clockwise will add {{the content of the}} operand register to the total. Turning the units key one division counterclockwise will subtract the content of the operand register from the current total. Turning the tens key one division clockwise will add 10 times the content of the operand register to the total etc..|$|R
30|$|ECVMAS was {{conducted}} by the Haitian Institute of Statistics (IHSI) {{as part of a}} program supported by the French National Research Agency (ANR), <b>DIAL</b> Research <b>Unit,</b> and the World Bank. The methodology was a variation on the 1 - 2 - 3 Survey, developed by DIAL to measure the informal economy and poverty. Javier Herrera, IRD Research Director, was the ANR project manager and Claire Zanuso was the ANR project coordinator from 2011 to 2014 and survey coordinator in Haiti. All data in this paper are from ECVMAS 2012, unless otherwise indicated.|$|R
50|$|The SABS {{also offered}} a {{secondary}} {{function as a}} windage measurement tool for accurate navigation. By simply tracking any suitable object {{on the ground with}} the range and line control wheels the wind speed and direction would be returned on the range <b>unit's</b> <b>dials.</b> Several methods were outlined for use at different altitudes and operational conditions.|$|R
50|$|Prior {{to modern}} geared dial mechanisms, test {{indicators}} using a single lever or systems of levers were common. The range and precision {{of these devices}} were generally inferior to modern <b>dial</b> type <b>units,</b> {{with a range of}} 10/1000 inch to 30/1000 inch, and precision of 1/1000 inch being typical. One common single lever test indicator was the Starrett (No. 64), and those using systems of levers for amplification were made by companies such Starrett (No. 564) and Lufkin (No. 199A), as well as smaller companies like Ideal Tool Co. Devices that could be used as either a lever test indicator or a plunger type were also manufactured by Koch.|$|R
5000|$|The R-Zone Headgear (1995) {{was largely}} {{different}} from later units {{in that the}} game cartridge was inserted into a device that was strapped onto the user's head. The user would flip down a transparent lens {{that was designed to}} reflect the game images into the user's right eye. The head unit held the game being played and was connected to a controller with a cable approximately 2.5 ft long. The controller required 4 AAA batteries, sported a cartridge storage slot (for keeping an additional game protected and available), volume adjustment dial, and brightness adjustment <b>dial.</b> This <b>unit</b> as a whole is sometimes thought to have been designed to compete against the Virtual Boy. The very first game to be distributed with this console was Batman Forever, based on the 1995 movie of the same name, followed by Sega's [...] arcade racing game Indy 500.|$|R
50|$|Before flight, the {{transceiver}} {{was set up}} with {{a selected}} day code of ten bits which was <b>dialed</b> into the <b>unit.</b> To start the identification procedure, the ground operator switched the pulse frequency of his radar from 3,750 Hz to 5,000 Hz. The airborne receiver decoded that and started to transmit the day code. The radar operator would then see the blip lengthen and shorten in the given code, ensuring it was not being spoofed. The IFF transmitter worked on 168 MHz with a power of 400 watts (PEP).|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Master Module" [...] {{physically}} resembles {{an oversized}} silver Atari cartridge. It has a phone jack {{on the side}} {{that was used to}} link the Master Module with the CVC computers. The module is able to transmit with pulse or tone <b>dialing,</b> allowing the <b>unit</b> to be versatile in the field. [...] The games available on the GameLine service were all from third-party gamemakers, the largest of which was Imagic (whose catalog is now controlled by Activision). CVC tried, but failed to obtain licensing agreements from the largest game makers, such as Atari, Activision, Coleco, Mattel, and Parker Brothers.|$|R
