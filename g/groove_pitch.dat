A special reproducer and modified feed screw mechanism were required to play them.

The wear {{analysis}} of chisel-edge ruling tool for diffraction gratings is very complex because of following two reasons {{that one is}} the wear distribution on edge after grating ruling is too minute so that hard to find and measured by conventional equipment like microscope, {{and the other is}} the effect of wear on the <b>groove</b> depth, <b>pitch,</b> ridge, blaze angle, non-blaze angle, groove bottom angle and diffraction efficiency of gratings.

50|$|The system {{appeared}} in Chrysler automobiles from 1956 to 1959 (1956-1958 model years). Records {{for the system}} were manufactured exclusively by Columbia Special Products, and could hold roughly 45 minutes of music or an hour of speech per side. This was accomplished {{by the use of}} a very slow rotation speed of 16⅔ RPM—versus 33 RPM for long-playing records and 45 RPM for singles—in conjunction with an extremely tight <b>groove</b> <b>pitch</b> of 550 grooves per inch (216.5 grooves per centimeter, over four times that of a standard monaural LP of the period). The recording surface extended to an unusually small diameter of 2+1/4 inch mm, which constrained the label to 1+1/2 inch mm for long-playing titles, but demonstration discs with brief contents not requiring an extended playing time were manufactured with standard 3 inch (76 mm) labels.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{cylinder}} records, {{the sound}} in a Diamond Disc's groove was {{recorded by the}} [...] "hill-and-dale" [...] method, as variations in {{the depth of the}} groove cut. At that time, with the notable exception of Pathé Records, which used yet another incompatible format, a disc's groove was normally of constant depth and modulated laterally, side-to-side. The vertical format demanded a perfectly flat surface for best results, so Edison made his Diamond Discs about one-quarter of an inch (6 mm) thick. They consisted of a thin coating of a hard plastic virtually identical to Bakelite on a core of compressed wood flour, and later also china clay. With very rare exceptions, all were about ten inches in diameter, but they used a finer <b>groove</b> <b>pitch</b> (150 threads per inch, or [...] "TPI") and could play longer than ordinary ten-inch records—up to five minutes per side.|$|E

A full album was issued the following year, and exists in two pressings, the latter from a remixed master made in 1981 for improved sound. [...] (The second edition can be distinguished by four lines of fine print below the artist name on the label; the first edition only has three.) The first two releases were instrumental, and the single has vocals, the B-side being Nash's first compositional collaboration with Toby Dammit who served as Nash's lyricist from 1980 to 1982.

The shape and orientation were controlled by presenting the epithelial cells with anisotropic parallel ridges and <b>grooves</b> of varying <b>pitch</b> at the cell substratum. As the cells oriented to the underlying topography, {{the volume of the}} nucleus increased as the pitch of the topography increased from 400  nm to 2000  nm. The increase in nucleus volume was reflected by an increase in the measured elastic modulus of the topographically aligned cells.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} an extremely light tracking force, the stylus arm is surrounded by coils which sense deflection, and a circuit in the player responds to the signals from these coils by moving the stylus head carriage in steps as the groove pulls the stylus across the disc. Other coils are used to deflect the stylus, to finely adjust tracking. This system is very similar to—yet predates—the one used in Compact Disc players to follow the spiral optical track, where typically a servo motor moves the optical pickup in steps for coarse tracking {{and a set of}} coils tilts the laser lens for fine tracking, both guided by an optical sensing device which is the analogue of CED stylus deflection sensing coils. For the CED player, this tracking arrangement has the additional benefit that the stylus drag angle remains uniformly tangent to the groove, unlike the case for a phonograph tonearm in which the stylus drag angle and consequently the stylus side force varies with the tone arm angle, which in turn depends on the radial position on the record of the stylus. Whereas for a phonograph, where the stylus has a pinpoint tip, linear tracking is merely ideal to reduce wear of records and styli and to maximize tracking stability, for a CED player linear tracking is a necessity for the keel-shaped stylus, which must always stay tangent to the groove. Furthermore, the achievement of an extremely light tracking force on the CED stylus enables the use of a fine <b>groove</b> <b>pitch</b> (i.e. fine spacing of adjacent revolutions of the spiral), necessary to provide a long playing time at the required high rotational speed, while also limiting the rate of disc and stylus wear.|$|E

40|$|Cellular {{response}} to microgrooves is addressed {{using a new}} assay format, comprising orthogonal gradients of continuously varied <b>groove</b> <b>pitch</b> and depth. Dual layer etch masks are created {{using a combination of}} micropatterning and plasma polymer deposition. A silicon substrate with a constant groove width of 8 μm and with ridge width increasing from 8 μm in 0. 5 μm steps across 10 mm is fabricated by photolithography. A plasma-polymerized hexane film which is 120 nm thick at one end of these grooves, and 10 nm at the other, is deposited under a diffusion mask. Reactive etching of the patterned sample transfers a gradient of <b>groove</b> <b>pitch</b> and groove depth into the silicon substrate. A silicon master with a gradient of groove depth spanning more than two orders of magnitude (less than 10 nm to over 1000 nm) is used to create an injection molding inlay for mass replication of the screening topography. Polycarbonate replicas are molded for use in cell culture studies, and the functionality of the topography as a high-throughput screening platform is investigated. The response of MDCK, h-TERT fibroblasts, and LE 2 endothelial cells is examined, in terms of attachment and morphological {{response to}} the variation in topographical cues, with the aim of pinpointing the optimal combination of <b>groove</b> <b>pitch</b> and depth to elicit a tailored response from each cell type.

50|$|Blue Amberols have {{a maximum}} playing time of about 4 minutes and 45 seconds and {{play at the}} {{standard}} post-1902 cylinder speed of 160 rpm. Like the preceding black wax Amberols, they provide twice the playing time of 2-minute cylinders by using a finer <b>groove</b> with a <b>pitch</b> of 200 lines per inch instead of 100. They cannot be played on older machines set up to play only the earlier standard 2 minute cylinders, as both wax and celluloid Amberols require a smaller stylus tip to fit the finer groove and the worm-gear which moves the stylus {{over the surface of}} the cylinder must turn at a different rate. Thomas A. Edison, Inc. sold kits with gear assemblies and reproducers that could be installed by the owner of an older Edison machine so that both standard and 4-minute records could be played. The Edison company also marketed new models capable of playing both. With these combination machines the operator needed to adjust a knob or lever that shifted gears and make sure the correct reproducing stylus was in position when switching from one record type to the other.|$|R
40|$|DNA {{exhibits}} a surprising multiplicity of structures {{when it is}} packed into dense aggregates. It undergoes various polymorphous transitions (e. g., from the B to A form) and mesomorphous transformations (from hexagonal to orthorhombic or monoclinic packing, changes in the mutual alignment of nearest neighbors, etc). In this report we show that such phenomena may {{have their origin in}} the specific helical symmetry of the charge distribution on DNA surface. Electrostatic interaction between neighboring DNA molecules exhibits strong dependence on the patterns of molecular surface groups and adsorbed counter-ions. As a result, it is affected by such structural parameters as the helical <b>pitch,</b> <b>groove</b> width, the number of base pairs per helical turn, etc. We derive expressions which relate the energy of electrostatic interaction with these parameters and with the packing variables characterizing the axial and azimuthal alignment between neighboring macromolecules. We show, in particular, that the structural changes upon the B-to-A transition reduce the electrostatic energy by ≈kcal/mol per base pair, at a random adsorption of counter ions. Ion binding into the narrow groove weakens or inverts this effect, stabilizing B-DNA, as it is presumably the case in Li+-DNA assemblies. The packing symmetry and molecular alignment in DNA aggregates are shown to be affected by the patterns of ion binding...|$|R

40|$|Recently, new {{processes}} to produce enhanced boiling surfaces have been developed. Those are extrusion, {{a combination of}} extrusion and chipping, mechanical rolling, hydraulic expansion, and sintering of metal powder, all of which involve complex operations and high production costs. Grooved rolling is introduced as a simple process to form enhanced boiling surfaces. First, the deformation caused by grooved rolling was analysed by applying a visioplasticity method with plasticine model rolling. Characteristic deformations using the grooved rolling technique occur {{in the form of}} a continuous indentation by the teeth of the grooved roll to the surface of a plane sheet or strip, deformation is mainly confined to the region between the teeth of the upper grooved roll and lower flat roll, plastic flow of the work occurs mainly in a longitudinally and the tips of rib projections formed by grooved rolling are rounded. Second, grooved rolling of thin aluminum and copper strips was examined and it was found that 1 mm <b>pitch</b> <b>grooves</b> can be formed on the strip surfaces successfully.

40|$|Failures of {{vascular}} grafts {{are normally}} {{caused by the}} lack of a durable and adherent endothelium covering the graft which leads to thrombus and neointima formation. A promising approach to overcome these issues is to create a functional, quiescent monolayer of endothelial cells on the surface of implants. The present study reports {{for the first time on}} the use of photoembossing as a technique to create polymer films with different topographical features for improved cell interaction in biomedical applications. For this, a photopolymer is created by mixing poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and trimethylolpropane ethoxylate triacrylate (TPETA) at a 1 : 1 ratio. This photopolymer demonstrated an improvement in biocompatibility over PMMA which is already known to be biocompatible and has been extensively used in the biomedical field. Additionally, photoembossed films showed significantly improved cell attachment and proliferation compared to their non-embossed counterparts. Surface texturing consisted of <b>grooves</b> of different <b>pitches</b> (6, 10, and 20 µm) and heights (1 µm and 2. 5 µm). The 20 µm pitch photoembossed films significantly accelerated cell migration in a wound-healing assay, while films with a 6 µm pitch inhibited cells from detaching. Additionally, the relief structure obtained by photoembossing also changed the surface wettability of the substrates. Photoembossed PMMA-TPETA systems benefited from this change as it improved their water contact angle to around 70 °, making it well suited for cell adhesion...|$|R
40|$|Organised nanotopography {{mimicking}} the natural extracellular matrix {{can be used}} to control morphology, cell motility, and differentiation. However, it is still unknown how specific cell types react with specific patterns. Both initial adhesion and preferential cell migration may be important to initiate and increase cell locomotion and coverage with cells, and thus achieve an enhanced wound healing response around an implantable material. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate how MC 3 T 3 -E 1 osteoblast initial adhesion and directional migration are influenced by nanogrooves with pitches ranging from 150 nm up to 1000 nm. In this study, we used a multi-patterned substrate with five different groove patterns and a smooth area with either a concentric or radial orientation. Initial cell adhesion measurements after 10 s were performed using atomic force spectroscopy-assisted single-cell force spectroscopy, and demonstrated that nascent cell adhesion was highly induced by a 600 nm pitch and reduced by a 150 nm pitch. Addition of RGD peptide significantly reduced adhesion, indicating that integrins and cell adhesive proteins (e. g. fibronectin or vitronectin) are key factors in specific cell adhesion on nanogrooved substrates. Also, cell migration was highly dependent on the groove pitch; the highest directional migration parallel to the grooves was observed on a 600 nm pitch, whereas a 150 nm pitch restrained directional cell migration. From this study, we conclude that <b>grooves</b> with a <b>pitch</b> of 600 nm may be favourable to enhance fast wound closure, thereby promoting tissue regeneration. ...|$|R

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we present}} {{the first example}} of a microfluidic chip based on BaF 2 for Infrared Microspectroscopy (IRMS) of living cells. The advantage in using barium fluoride as platform relies on its high IR transparency, especially in the spectral region below 1300 cm 1, where the absorption bands of nucleic acids and carbohydrates are located. Barium fluoride is slightly soluble in water (0. 12 g/ 100 g water) and it is potentially harmful for living cells. To overcome these problems, here we exploit an approach whose feasibility has been demonstrated previously on CaF 2 : the surface modification obtained by sputtering a thin Si layer on the surface. The Surface Modified Microfluidic Devices (SM-MD) hence obtained not only solve the BaF 2 drawbacks, but also provide a silicon-like substrate fully compatible with standard micro-fabrication processes.

40|$|The {{current work}} {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} nanoscale surface-topographies in combination with a calcium phosphate (CaP) coating on acellular and cellular surface mineralization. Four groups of substrates were produced, including smooth, <b>grooved</b> (940 nm <b>pitch,</b> 430 nm <b>groove</b> width, 185 nm depth), smooth coated, and grooved coated. The substrates were characterized by scanning/transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Osteoblast-like MC 3 T 3 cells were cultured on the substrates for a period up to 35 days under osteogenic conditions. Differentiation was observed by alkaline phosphatase assay and PCR of collagen I (COLI), osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OC), bone-morphogenic protein 2 (BMP 2), and bone sialoprotein (BSP). Mineralization was quantified by a calcium assay and Alizarin Red staining. In addition, acellular mineralization was determined after incubation of substrates in just cell culture medium without cells. Results showed that a reproducible nano-metric (approximately 50 nm) CaP-layer could be applied on the substrates, without losing {{the integrity of the}} topographical features. While no relevant differences were found for cell viability, cells on smooth surfaces proliferated for a longer period than cells on grooved substrates. In addition, differentiation was affected by topographies, as indicated by an increased expression of OC, OPN and ALP activity. Deposition of a CaP coating significantly increased the acellular mineralization of smooth as well grooved substrate-surfaces. However, this mineralizing effect was strongly reduced in the presence of cells. In the cell seeded situation, mineralization was significantly increased by the substrate topography, while only a minor additive effect of the coating was observed. In conclusion, the model presented herein can be exploited for experimental evaluation of cell-surface interaction processes and optimization of bone-anchoring capability of implants. The model showed that substrates modified with CaP-coated coated nanogrooves display enhanced in vitro mineralization as compared to unmodified controls or substrates modified with either nanogrooves or CaP coatings. However, our results also indicated that acellular mineralization assays are not necessarily predictive for biological performance. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The manuscript describes the possibility to combine the mechanical properties of nanosized topographies with the biochemical properties of a calcium phosphate based coating for improvement of surface mineralization. Interestingly, our results demonstrate that further incubation of our surfaces in SBF type media allowed all surfaces to mineralize rapidly to a high extent. Moreover we prove that nanotexture be used to can stimulate and organize mineralization and that the combination surface of a CaP coating and a nanotexture {{has the potential to be}} effective as a bone-implant surface. Such experiments will be of considerable interest to those in the research community and industry, who are focusing on bio-mineralization processes and optimization of modern bone-implants...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel method of {{generating}} and retrieving droplets stored in microfluidic grooves or cavity structures. First we designed and fabricated polydimethylsiloxane microchannels with grooves {{on the walls}} and then produced a two-phase flow of oil and aqueous phases to form aqueous phase droplets in an oil state. We propose the following three mechanisms of droplet generation: the contact line on the groove wall continues moving along the wall and descends {{to the bottom of the}} cavity, confining the aqueous phase in the cavity; once the interface between the oil and aqueous phases moves into the cavity, the interface contacts the top of the neighboring groove; and a spherical droplet forms at the corner in the cavity due to surface tension. The viscosity of the oil phase and the surface tension of the interface determine whether a droplet can be generated. Then, we could adjust the velocity of the interface and the aspect ratio of the cavity to achieve the optimal conditions for generating the single droplet. We observed that the largest droplet is stably generated without a daughter droplet at typical values of free-stream velocity (10 μl∕min) and <b>groove</b> <b>pitch</b> 110 μm for all three cases with different oil phases (20, 50, and 84 cP).

40|$|Tri-helical, gravure roll coating, {{operated}} in reverse mode, is investigated via a combined experimental, theoretical and computational approach. New experiments {{were conducted on}} a pilot coating rig, designed to simulate the industrial process. Flow visualisations reveal the underlying flow structure within the roll-to-web transfer region and highlight when loss of coating stability (streaking) occurs. The latter {{is found to be}} influenced by the depth of the tri-helical grooves and the capillary number. Experiments show that as the web-to-roll speed ratio is increased, so too is fluid pickout from the grooves, although the coated film thickness may decrease. A key feature of the present investigation is the formulation of a novel complementary mathematical model. By starting with a simplified form of the coating process and progressively adding complexity a set of models are developed, first for simple zero pitch angled rectangular grooves then for grooves of arbitrary shape and <b>groove</b> <b>pitch.</b> A further extension to the model is the inclusion of a non-Newtonian model for the fluid (specifically a shear thinning power law formulation). Analysis of the application of shear thinning fluids to the moving substrate is also conducted. The base model developed is that for rectangular grooves of zero pitch, which takes the form of an analytical solution of the flow equation (a Poisson equation) along a groove. An extension to this model is made by solving the Poisson equation for non-rectangular grooves using the finite element method. Simple meniscus models were applied to make the problem tractable. Agreement between experimental data and predictions from the model is seen to be good for the range of operating conditions considered up to the onset of streaking. A final extension to the model considers grooves at non-zero pitch angles, representative of the industrial coating process. The limitations of this model, when compared to experimental data are examined and a physical explanation is postulated for the breakdown of the model at steep pitch angles. Under conditions of breakdown, the high pressures within the groove are consistent with the idea that elastohydrodynamics is an important mechanism in the transfer of fluid within the coating bead for discrete cell gravure coating.

40|$|Heat {{exchanger}} {{devices are}} widely used in industries, air conditioning systems, refrigeration, etc. These devices have {{a major role in}} energy conservation; therefore, increasing the performance of heat exchangers helps save energy, costs and materials. The technique to increase the heat transfer performance is called heat augmentation, which can be applied to pipe surfaces and other surfaces which are used in heat exchangers to improve thermal performance. These techniques are categorized into 3 groups: passive, active and compound technique. In this study a helically machined rectangular groove on the inside of a 2. 0 m tube with a diameter of 7. 1 mm was studied for the heat augmentation effect. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) investigation has been carried out to study the heat transfer enhancement in a smooth tube and in four grooved tubes with different pitch sizes (7. 1, 12. 7, 50 and 130 (mm)). The simulations were performed in the Reynolds number range of 4000 - 20000. The current CFD predicted values were compared with previously collected experimental data. First, the CFD simulation was run for different groove pitches (203, 254 and 305) to compare them with the published experimental work. The results of these simulations for Nu numbers and friction factors showed good agreement with the experimental values. The primary focus of this study involves evaluating the effect of <b>groove</b> <b>pitch</b> on heat transfer and friction factors. A thermal enhancement factor is defined to evaluate the performance of the internally grooved tubes. By decreasing the pitch size from 130 to 7. 1 (mm) at the same Reynolds number, both Nusselt number and friction factor increase. Also, by increasing the Reynolds number, the Nusselt number, as expected, becomes greater. The highest Nusselt number is obtained for smaller pitch size of 7. 1 and 12. 7 (mm) but at the penalty of a greater pressure drop compared to smooth tubes. It is observed that there is an optimum value of the enhancement factor (η) at about Re = 15, 000 for all investigated grooves and enhancement up to 20 % is obtained for grooved tubes with 7. 1 mm pitch size. The heat transfer properties of grooved tubes revealed that the CFD simulations can be used to improve future design considerations, which leads to improvement of performance in heat exchanger devices...|$|E
