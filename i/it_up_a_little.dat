He comments that he believes she may have inserted them into the books to encourage readers to learn more about mythology and folklore; [...] "As [...] said when somebody asked her in a chat about the source of one of the unforgivable curses , she said, 'Look <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> investigation is good for a person.'" ...|$|E
500|$|On the reveal, Dohring {{said in an}} interview: [...] "I’m {{actually}} glad, Rob told {{us about}} episode six or seven that we would get together. We were like, ‘No way!’ But there was something going on there. We could feel it as actors. It was damn cool – these characters {{had some kind of}} connection. So we had to start to soften <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m glad he gave us that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so fun to watch ," [...] adding that [...] "a lot of that emotion was real for me." [...] The song [...] "Momentary Thing" [...] by band Something Happens plays during Veronica and Logan's first kiss.|$|E
500|$|Jamie King {{was chosen}} as tour {{director}}. Tim Miller and Kevin Antunes served as director of production and musical director, respectively. Mark Foffano {{was chosen as}} the lightning director. Spears described the tour as [...] "like a Broadway show". The setlist included material from her first studio album ...Baby One More Time (1999) as well as seven songs from Oops!... I Did It Again. Spears explained, [...] "I've been singing the same material for so long now. It'll be nice to change <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit." [...] She also talked about her expectations for the tour, saying, [...] "I can't wait. I'll have a world tour. I'm going to have more dancers, a bigger stage, more pyro... just a lot bigger". The proscenium stage was much more elaborate than the stage of her previous tour and included video screens, movable platforms and different props. It cost $2.2 million to build. The tone of the show variated from the beginning: for the performance of [...] "Born to Make You Happy", Spears sang in a set resembling a children's bedroom, complete with large toys and a pillow fight routine. On the contrary, she unveiled a more sophisticated image for [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", and followed it with raunchy performances for [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] and [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again".|$|E

2500|$|The band {{sees the}} album as {{a return to}} the raw sound heard on L.D. 50, with guitarist Greg Tribbett saying in an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone magazine [...] "Instead of being all slick, we're definitely going for a raw sound on this record. The last one was pretty smooth and the first record, L.D. 50, was raw, so we're kind of mixing <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit." [...] Matt McDonough said he believed the music on the album would reflect a refinement of Mudvayne's complexly structured hard rock balanced against more melody than any previous album. Bassist Ryan Martinie added [...] "Our goal for the third album is to make music that pleases us because if it makes us happy then the rest will take care of itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 27, 2000, {{during an}} {{interview}} with Jam! Canoes Stephanie McGrath, Aguilera revealed plans to release {{at least two more}} singles from her debut: [...] "So Emotional" [...] in the fall and [...] "Come On Over" [...] as soon as [...] "I Turn To You", [...] "runs its toll," [...] she said. [...] "So Emotional" [...] indeed had a simple music video, which was available through her YouTube/VEVO account, showing Christina in a casual outfit recording the song in the studio. However, the song was never released and [...] "Come on Over" [...] was chosen instead. For the song's release, Aguilera claimed: [...] "We're going to head back in the studio, give it more of an edge, R <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> maybe rock it out a little, give it a lot of different new directions and get it out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{expected}} for a March 2006 release, the album had two title changes and three unofficial releases until its official release the following year. Initially {{scheduled for a}} July 11, 2006 release, the album's original draft, entitled My Story, was eventually shelved {{in favor of a}} revamped version with a different vibe. Although manager Matthew Knowles initially insisted that the decision to push the release date from July 2006 was because more time would be needed to properly set up the project, Rowland later admitted that she had been unsatisfied with the album's direction, and thus, she asked to rework with a stable of new record producers on the project. Speaking of the delay and the original track listing, she told Billboard: [...] "it was basically a list of songs that I put together about the past three years of my life, with love and relationships", and added: [...] "And I remember listening to the record, and I was just like, 'I don't want this to be too deep to where, you know, [...] lose people.' And the record was too full of midtempos and ballads, so I wanted to bring <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I have neither, {{and very}} few friends to care whether I live or die," [...] said Mr. Brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the dead rose in the hole he had made and covered <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> like <b>a</b> <b>little</b> grave.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should think}} I had! They have set <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gold frame on the drawing-room table, and {{everybody}} stands and says how handsome it is; and Aunt Mary explains {{all about him}} till I am tired of hearing it.' ...|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{producers}} of the album was Guy Roche, who produced two tracks ("What a Girl Wants" [...] and [...] "I Turn to You") and co-wrote one of them ("What a Girl Wants"), along with Shelly Peiken. [...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] was later re-recorded for its single release, replacing the [...] "lighter" [...] version for a more [...] "funky" [...] R version. Peiken also re-wrote with Roche the single version for the track [...] "Come on Over", first produced by Johan Aberg, Paul Rein and Aaron Zigman. According to herself, [...] "We're {{going to give it}} more of an edge, R <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> maybe rock it out a little, give it a lot of different new directions and get it out there." [...] Aguilera also recorded a cover of All-4-One's song [...] "I Turn to You", written by Diane Warren. Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers (who would eventually broke into the scene as the producers who launched Rihanna's career) wrote and produced two tracks, while the then up-and-coming Robin Thicke co-wrote and co-produced [...] "When You Put Your Hands on Me". Franne Golde (who previously worked with Whitney Houston) also wrote a song for Aguilera. At the final stages, producer and songwriter David Frank presented a song called [...] "Genie in a Bottle", which Aguilera almost didn't record, [...] "because {{there were a lot of}} other artists out there that were after this song, so we had to fight a little bit to get it," [...] she claimed. With Heather Holley, Aguilera also co-wrote a track called [...] "I Will Be", which she said was inspired by Mariah Carey's [...] "Vanishing". Producer of the track [...] "So Emotional" [...] revealed that Aguilera in-between recordings [...] "she was only listening to Mariah Carey and Brandy, putting on her walk man and practicing their riffs and runs, before she did her ad-libs.|$|E
