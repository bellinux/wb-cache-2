25|$|In Bracton's time, the {{question}} frequently arose about land held in <b>frankalmoign</b> (land {{donated to the}} Church). Writs were common prohibiting Church courts from meddling into the title of land, {{even if it were}} to be held in <b>frankalmoign.</b> The question was that of lay fee, which was the equivalent of secular lands, even though it may have been held in free, pure and perpetual alms. Bracton posited that land which is sacred (housing Churches and the like) was within the jurisdiction of the Church. To this could be added lands donated {{in the form of a}} dower. A glance of the plea rolls demonstrates them to be covered with writs of prohibitions directed at ecclesiastical judges in a continuous battle over jurisdiction of Church lands.|$|E

50|$|Quia Emptores {{ended the}} ancient {{practice}} of <b>frankalmoign</b> whereby lands could {{be donated to}} a Church organization {{to be held in}} perpetuity. <b>Frankalmoign</b> created a tenure whereby the holder (the Church) was exempt from all services, except trinoda necessitas. Quia Emptores allowed no new tenure in <b>frankalmoign,</b> except by the Crown. The issues arising from <b>frankalmoign</b> had been addressed by the Statute of Mortmain. Quia Emptores took mortmain one step further by banning outright the formation of new tenures, except by the Crown.|$|E
5000|$|Every {{feoffment}} {{made by a}} new tenant {{could not}} be in <b>frankalmoign,</b> since the donee was a layman; it would be reckoned {{by the laws of}} socage. Socage grew at the expense of <b>frankalmoign.</b> The tenant in chief could not alienate without the license of the King. Petty serjeanty came to be treated as [...] "socage in effect".|$|E

50|$|In 1471 {{the king}} granted the Yorkshire manor {{of the alien}} priory of Begare in return for three daily masses being said for the king and the souls of his family (a {{practice}} known as <b>frankalmoign)</b> but in 1472 it was re-granted to Eton College, who had been previous holders of a grant.|$|E
50|$|Like its Bridgetown counterpart, Ballybeg, {{in which}} the de Roches also had a part in its {{foundation}} and endowment, was probably held from the de Barrys in <b>frankalmoign</b> and included rights such as gallows and baronial courts for all contentious issues and pleas arising on the abbey's domain among its tenants and bondsmen, excepting those reserved to the crown. Alexander fitz Hugh de la Roche enfeoffed his nephew Maurice le Fleming with {{the western part of}} Fermoy. This Maurice le Fleming gave two carucates of land for the foundation of Bridgetown Abbey, while his grandson William Fitz Richard de Barry, granted the church of Cahirduggan to the Priory of Ballybeg by charter perfected on 28 September 1273.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{mention of}} it under its present name {{occurs in the}} Testa de Nevill {{towards the end of}} the 13th century, when it was held in two moieties, half a fee under John de Lisle of Wootton by Henry de Botebrigge, and a fifth of a fee, {{formerly}} held by Walter Urry under Matilda de Estur of Gatcombe, by the Abbot of Quarr Abbey. In 1328, Henry de Botebrigge, and in 1331 Robert de Botebrigge, confirmed a grant made by their ancestors in <b>frankalmoign</b> to the Abbot and convent of Quarr of part of the meadow called Ryedemede in the east part of the road from Budbridge to 'la Rydeforde.' [...] By the middle of the 14th century, Henry de Botebrigge had been succeeded by Henry Romyn. In 1358, William de Wintershill seems to have been in possession of Budbridge, here called a manor, as in that year he demised it to John de Weggham.|$|E
40|$|The {{validity}} of historic or ancient title to territory {{has been tested}} in numerous international judicial proceedings, both in the International Court of Justice and in international arbitration. Historic title usually originates in ancient normative systems, including tributary, feudal, sultanate, and Islamic systems that predate the Western international legal system. Nevertheless, the rules against which historic title has been tested in international judicial proceedings generally require that the original titleholder be a state or a central authority that exercised territorial sovereignty over a defined space {{to the exclusion of}} other sovereign powers. The rules that apply specifically to these ancient normative systems, where allegiance to authority was personal or religious rather than territorial, have been seen as irrelevant compared to the more contemporary determinations of historic title. The only exceptions have been the French medieval customary norm <b>frankalmoign,</b> which the international arbitral tribunal in the Minquiers and Ecrehos case cited as evidence that the English king exercised territorial sovereignty over the disputed islands, and the personal allegiance of the Orang Laut to the Sultan of Johore, coupled with the recognition accorded to the latter by the great maritime powers, which the International Court of Justice in Malaysia v. Singapore found sufficient to prove the historic title of Malaysia over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh and Middle Rocks. The principles by which historic title were adjudicated in these cases appear to be the same principles by which the Western powers dealt with the claims of the People's Republic of China and Vietnam to the Paracel Islands and the Spratly Islands, not only during the colonial period but also after the Second World War. This analysis suggests how the International Court of Justice or an international arbitral tribunal might, if given the opportunity, resolve these South China Sea disputes. Readers might also find this analysis to be particularly relevant to other disputes involving historic title, including the East China Sea disputes, although the focus of this article is on the South China Sea disputes. States and other commentators are left to rely on their own preferences and allegiances in reaching their own normative conclusions using the novel analysis provided by this article...|$|E
