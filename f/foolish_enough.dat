Tsunayoshi's thirst for power has created conflict around ownership of the Demon Blades, samurai swords forged by the legendary swordsmith Muramasa Sengo that crave blood when drawn and bring madness and death to those <b>foolish</b> <b>enough</b> to draw them.

I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me.

25|$|Mercian {{military}} {{success was}} {{the basis of their}} power; it succeeded not only 106 kings and kingdoms by winning set-piece battles, but by ruthlessly ravaging any area <b>foolish</b> <b>enough</b> to withhold tribute. There are a number of casual references scattered throughout the Bede's history to this aspect of Mercian military policy. Penda is found ravaging Northumbria as far north as Bamburgh and only a miraculous intervention from Aidan prevents the complete destruction of the settlement. In 676 Æthelred conducted a similar ravaging in Kent and caused such damage in the Rochester diocese that two successive bishops gave up their position because of lack of funds. In these accounts there is a rare glimpse of the realities of early Anglo-Saxon overlordship and how a widespread overlordship could be established in a relatively short period. By the middle of the 8th century, other kingdoms of southern Britain were also affected by Mercian expansionism. The East Saxons seem to have lost control of London, Middlesex and Hertfordshire to Æthelbald, although the East Saxon homelands do not seem to have been affected, and the East Saxon dynasty continued into the ninth century. The Mercian influence and reputation reached its peak when, in the late 8th century, the most powerful European ruler of the age, the Frankish king Charlemagne, recognised the Mercian King Offa's power and accordingly treated him with respect, even if this could have been just flattery.|$|E

500|$|Clarence {{did well}} in school, and upon his {{graduation}} from Waltham High School in 1903, he took the entrance examinations for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He passed, and after taking basic courses at the school, did advanced work in engineering. During the summers, he worked for J.B. Worcester & Co., a firm which had constructed much of the Boston subway system. While at school, he became a favourite pupil of Professor George Swain; after Howe graduated in 1907, Swain offered Howe a job as his teaching assistant. Howe accepted, although the young engineer felt that he should leave the Boston area to begin his career. Soon afterwards, Howe was offered an opportunity to become an engineering professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. A popular story about Howe was that Swain had Howe and fellow engineer James Barker toss a coin to see who would get the job. Barker denied the tale later in life, stating he {{had no interest in}} the position and no one who knew Howe would be <b>foolish</b> <b>enough</b> to gamble with him, as Howe had shown himself to be uncommonly lucky. [...] In any event, Howe had no better prospects in sight; unemployment among his classmates was high due to the Panic of 1907.|$|E

He promotes a non-existent 'multi-level marketing' company with its controversial chain referral schemes promising a BMW car within the year.

About 40 minutes into the film Gandhi Babu is arrested and multiple cases filed against him. But the money he has scammed over the years comes to his rescue and he is released. He is not in the least remorseful and continues to manipulate everyone. He believes that if a person is <b>foolish</b> or greedy <b>enough</b> to be duped, then the person is to be blamed. He argues that every election voters are conned by the candidates who promise them the moon, but never come through. Banu (Ishara Nair) is from a poor family.

Some of his friends betray him and is beaten to pulp. Banu looks after him for some time and they get married. She becomes pregnant. Towards the end of the film, a group of people whom he had tricked, capture him. They threaten him to settle their lump sum of money. He performs a final heist to hand over the money to them. The passage of money results in a tussle. Babu kills each one of them and returns to his wife and child with the money.

Some thoughtful persons regarded the book with utter contempt and indignation; it seemed to them a crime to have written it; a proof of 'banausia,' as Aristotle would have called it, only to be outdone by the writing a 'Comic Bible.' After a while, however, their indignation began to subside; their second thoughts, as usual, were more charitable than their first; they were not {{surprised to hear that}} the author was an honest, just, and able magistrate; they saw that the publication of such a book involved no moral turpitude; that it was merely meant as a jest on a subject on which jesting was permissible, and as a money speculation in a field of which men had a right to make money; while all which seemed offensive in it was merely the outcome, and as it were apotheosis, of that method of writing English history which has been popular for nearly a hundred years.

About Montgomery's conduct of the Normandy campaign, Badsey wrote: [...] "Too much discussion on Normandy has centered on the controversial decisions of the Allied commanders. It was not good enough, apparently, to win such a complete and spectacular victory over an enemy that had conquered most of Europe unless it was done perfectly. Most of the blame for this lies with Montgomery, who was <b>foolish</b> <b>enough</b> to insist that it had been done perfectly, that Normandy – and all his other battles – had been fought accordingly to a precise master plan drawn up beforehand, from which he never deviated.

2500|$|The Peace of Amiens {{temporarily}} left Baker {{without a}} ship, but {{he returned to}} active service with the resumption of hostilities, taking command of the 36-gun [...] on 28 April 1803. He {{was assigned to the}} Channel Fleet under Admiral William Cornwallis, and on 10 August 1805 he came across the 40-gun French frigate [...] off Cape Finisterre. Prior to the sighting the Phoenix had intercepted an American merchant, en route from Bordeaux to the United States. The American master had been invited onto the Phoenix, sold the British some of his cargo of wine, and had toured the Phoenix before being allowed to continue on his way. The Phoenix had at this time been altered to resemble from a distance a large sloop of war. The Didon, which was carrying despatches instructing Rear-Admiral Allemand's five ships of the line to unite with the combined Franco-Spanish fleet under Vice-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, intercepted the American merchant and from him received news that a 20-gun British frigate was at sea and might be <b>foolish</b> <b>enough</b> to attack the Didon. The Didons commander, Captain Milius, decided to await the arrival of the British ship, and take her as a prize. The Phoenix was therefore able to approach and engage the Didon before the French realised that she was a larger frigate than they had anticipated. After a sharp action lasting several hours, with Baker on one occasion having his hat shot off his head, the French surrendered. The Phoenix had 12 killed and 28 wounded, the French sustained losses of 27 killed and 44 wounded. By intercepting the ship carrying the despatches for Allemand, Baker had unwittingly played a role in bringing about the battle of Trafalgar, but he was to play an even greater role a few days later, possibly even staving off an invasion of England.|$|E
