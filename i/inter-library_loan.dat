The result of this thesis is a description of methods for monitoring inter- library loans at selected libraries in the Czech Republic...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the origins of}} <b>inter-library</b> <b>loans</b> in Australia in relation to special libraries. Prior to the advent of low-cost computing, union lists in special libraries were rare. In the early 1980 's a number of serials union lists for health libraries were compiled that {{formed the basis for}} wider collaboration in <b>inter-library</b> <b>loans</b> (ILL). Gratis is a network of special libraries that formed on December 6, 1982, with 14 founding members. The immediate impetus to the formation of the group was the trebling of the cost of ILL. A small annual subscription funds a network now comprising over 250 special libraries in heath and allied fields, many of which are too small to participate in the national ILL network. Careful distribution of workload helps to facilitate participation among large and smaller libraries. This co-operative model has subsequently been adopted by law, emergency services, transport and government library networks in Australia and New Zealand. The paper will examine the origins of <b>Inter-Library</b> <b>loans</b> in Australia and the factors that gave rise to the Gratis libraries network, and its progressive adoption throughout Australia and the co-operative factors that distinguish GratisNet from the national ILL service...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} {{resource}} sharing among libraries has {{become even more}} important today with constraints of finance, space, and manpower. Traditional forms of resource sharing – <b>inter-library</b> <b>loans</b> and document delivery – are more suited to a print environment than a digital environment. The digital environment however provides many new opportunities for resource sharing, and the literature suggests many emerging models. This paper examines the views, practices, and plans of resource sharing among Malaysian academic libraries. From the interviews conducted, {{it was noted that}} librarians were aware of and support the concept of resource sharing. Current resource sharing activities in Malaysia centre on <b>inter-library</b> <b>loans</b> and document delivery services. Resource sharing in the digital environment is based on existing collaborative projects, and the proposed Consortium of Malaysian Libraries. Factors that influence success in resource sharing include the need for a shared commitment, the willingness to contribute, technologically skilled staff, and a need to understand legal implications...|$|R
