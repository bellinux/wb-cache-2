40|$|Thin <b>bonded</b> <b>films</b> {{have many}} {{applications}} (i. e. in information {{storage and processing}} systems, and etc.). In many cases, thin <b>bonded</b> <b>films</b> {{are in a state}} of residual tension, which can lead to film cracking and crack extension in one layer often accompanies failure in whole systems. In this pa-per, we analyze a channel crack advanced throughout thickness of an <b>elastic</b> thin <b>film</b> <b>bonded</b> to a dissimilar semi-infinite substrate material via finite element method (FEM). In order to simplify modeling, the problem is idealized as plane strain and a two-dimensional model of a <b>film</b> <b>bonded</b> to an <b>elastic</b> substrate is proposed for simulating channel crack in thin elastic film. Film is mod-eled by common 4 -node and substrate by infinite 4 -node meshes. The stress intensity factor (SIF) for cracked thin film has been obtained as a function of elastic mismatch between the substrate and the film. The results indicate that in elastic mismatch state, SIF is more than match state. On the other hand, mismatch state is more sensitive to crack than match state. And SIF has also in...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} developed to understand the mechanism of blister initiation and propagation. The model employs a two-part theoretical approach encompassing the debondment of a coating film from the substrate, coupled with the design components incorporating diffusion and fracture mechanics, where the latter is derived from equi-biaxial tensile loading. Integrating the two components, a comprehensive mathematical design for the propagation of blister boundaries based on specific toughness functions and mode adjustment parameters has been developed. This approach provided a reliable and efficient prediction method for blister growth rate and mechanisms. The model provided a foundation for holistic design based on diffusion and mechanic components to enable {{better understanding of the}} debondment of thin <b>elastic</b> <b>films</b> <b>bonded</b> to a metallic substrate...|$|R
40|$|The {{surfaces}} of soft thin <b>elastic</b> <b>films</b> <b>bonded</b> to two rigid substrates become spontaneously rough {{due to the}} attractive intersurface interactions when the intersurface distance declines sufficiently to produce a critical force. Theeffects of compressibility on the conditions for surface roughening and its length scale are investigated. For highly compressible films (nu less than 0. 25), surface roughening is not possible. The critical force required for the onset of instability and its wave number both decline with increased compressibility. The wavelength of the instability is influenced much more by the properties ofthe more compliant film [compliance equals (1 - 2 nu) h/ 2 mu(1 - nu) ]. There is an abrupt change in the wavelength as the compliances of the two films become nearly equal...|$|R
40|$|When a {{flexible}} plate is peeled off a thin and soft <b>elastic</b> <b>film</b> <b>bonded</b> to a rigid sup-port, uniformly spaced fingering patterns develop along their line of contact. Although the wavelength of these patterns depends {{only on the}} thickness of the film, their amplitude varies with all material and geometric properties of the film and that of the adhering plate. Here we have analyzed this instability by the reg-ular perturbation technique to obtain the excess deformations of the film over and above the base quantities. Furthermore, by calculating the excess energy of the sys-tem, we have shown that these excess deformations, associated with the instability, occur for films that are critically confined. We have presented two different experi-ments for controlling the degree of confinement: by prestretching the film and by adjusting the contact width between the film and the plate...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the deformation of a thin <b>elastic</b> <b>film</b> <b>bonded</b> to a thick compliant substrate, when the (compressive) misfit is far beyond critical. We take a variational viewpoint – {{focusing on the}} total elastic energy, i. e. the membrane and bending energy of the film plus the elastic energy of the substrate – viewing the buckling of the film as a problem of energy-driven pattern formation. We identify the scaling law of the minimum energy {{with respect to the}} physical parameters of the problem, and we prove that a herringbone pattern achieves the optimal scaling. These results complement previous numerical studies, which have shown that an optimized herringbone pattern has lower energy than a number of other patterns. Our results are different because (i) we make the scaling law achieved by the herringbone pattern explicit, and (ii) we give an elementary, ansatz-free proof that no pattern can achieve a better law. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} thin <b>elastic</b> <b>films</b> <b>bonded</b> on an <b>elastic</b> {{orthotropic}} substrate under thermal load is investigated in this work. Differently from {{past studies on}} the same topic, the effects induced by anisotropic behavior of the elastic substrate will be taken into account. Particular attention will also {{be paid to the}} determination of the displacement and stress fields induced by thermal loading. In particular, it is assumed that the thin films are deposed on the substrate at high temperature, and then the mismatch occurring during the cooling process, due to the difference between the thermal expansion coefficients of the two materials, is responsible for the permanent deformation assumed by the system. This phenomenon can be exploited for realizing a crystalline undulator. To this aim, the permanent deformation must be optimized in order to encourage the channeling phenomenon. By imposing equilibrium conditions and perfect adhesion between the film and the substrate, a singular integral equation is derived. A closed-form solution is achieved by expanding the interfacial shear stress fields in Chebyshev series. The unknown coefficients in the series expansion are then determined by transforming the integral equation into an infinite algebraic system...|$|R
40|$|Subject to a {{compressive}} membrane stress, an <b>elastic</b> <b>film</b> <b>bonded</b> on a substrate {{can become}} unstable, forming wrinkles, creases or delaminated buckles. Further increasing the compressive stress can induce advanced modes of instabilities including period-doubles, folds, localized ridges, delamination, and coexistent instabilities. While various instabilities in film-substrate systems under compression have been analyzed separately, a systematic and quantitative {{understanding of these}} instabilities is still elusive. Here we present a joint experimental and theoretical study to systematically explore the instabil-ities in elastic film-substrate systems under uniaxial compression. We use the Maxwell stability criterion to analyze the occurrence and evolution of instabilities analogous to phase transitions in thermodynamic systems. We show that the moduli of the film and the substrate, the film-substrate adhesion strength, the film thickness, and the prestretch in the substrate determine various modes of instabilities. Defects in the film-substrate system can facilitate it to overcome energy barriers during occurrence and evolution of instabil-ities. We provide a set of phase diagrams to predict both initial and advanced modes of instabilities in compressed film-substrate systems. The phase diagrams {{can be used to}} guide the design of film-substrate systems to achieve desired modes of instabilities. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4025828]...|$|R

40|$|Thermal barrier coating (TBC) {{is widely}} used to lower the {{temperature}} of turbine blades and prevent the premature failure of superalloy substrates. Horizontal and vertical cracks play key roles in the thermal durability of TBC. It is believed that the surface cracks, which form perpendicular to the substrate surface, have a promising potential to improve the thermal life of TBC by increasing coating tolerance to thermal mismatch stresses. In contrast, as the density of horizontal cracks, especially the interfacial delamination increases TBC life decreases and TBC generally fails by coating spalling. This study aims to identify the surface cracking behavior of TBC and its influence on interfacial delamination. Multiple cracking behaviors in a thin <b>elastic</b> <b>film</b> <b>bonded</b> to a thick elastic substrate are firstly investigated by varying the morphology of segmentation cracks. Then, the effect of periodic surface cracks on the interfacial fracture is studied. It is found that surface crack spacing has {{significant effect on the}} initiation and propagation of interfacial delamination. A critical value is obtained based on the dependence of energy release rate on the surface crack density. The failure mechanisms of an advanced double-ceramic-layer TBC are also examined. It is found that the interface between two ceramic layers may directly influence the lifetime of TBC...|$|R
