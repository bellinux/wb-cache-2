5|$|Fly ash {{and bottom}} ash are two {{byproducts}} made through {{the burning of}} coal in power stations. Ash is normally dumped in the station's Ash Lagoons landfill site, which is located on site. Since 2006, ash produced at Lynemouth Power Station has been recycled and used as a sub-fill material <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>industry</b> and {{in the production of}} grout. In 2007, 63,000 tonnes of ash from the station, along with 100,000 tonnes of ash from the Ash Lagoons, was taken and recycled. In September 2007, Pulverised Fuel Ash was utilised as a filling material in the capping of Woodhorn Landfill, which had been used for the disposal of spent potlining from the smelter.|$|E
5|$|Shielded metal {{arc welding}} {{is one of the}} world's most popular welding processes, {{accounting}} for over half of all welding in some countries. Because of its versatility and simplicity, it is particularly dominant in the maintenance and repair industry, and is heavily used in the construction of steel structures and in industrial fabrication. In recent years its use has declined as flux-cored arc welding has expanded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>industry</b> and gas {{metal arc welding}} has become more popular in industrial environments. However, because of the low equipment cost and wide applicability, the process will likely remain popular, especially among amateurs and small businesses where specialized welding processes are uneconomical and unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|At a {{congress}} in 1897 in Halle, the localists founded {{a national organization}} of their own, the Representatives' Centralization of Germany (Vertrauensmänner-Zentralisation Deutschlands). The congress was originally supposed to take place a year earlier, but {{a lack of interest}} forced it to be postponed. There were 37 delegates at the congress representing 6,803 union members. Nearly two-thirds of the delegates came from Berlin or Halle. Almost half the delegates worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>industry,</b> while 14 delegates came from highly specialized professions. The congress decided to establish a five-person Business Commission seated in Berlin to organize political actions, aid in communication between local organizations, and raise financial support for strikes. Fritz Kater became the chairman of the commission. A newspaper, Solidarität (Solidarity), was founded, but the name was changed to Die Einigkeit (Unity) the following year. It initially appeared fortnightly, but was published on a weekly basis beginning in 1898.|$|E
5|$|Gases {{from the}} furnace are cleaned using {{selective}} non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions. The remaining gases are passed through fine-fabric bag filters to remove and solid particles, {{before it is}} released from the chimney. Each incineration line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining fly ash from the filters contains particles from the incineration, lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. Incinerator bottom ash left on the incineration grate after the burning is moved by converyor to a bunker. Whilst on the conveyor, a magnet removes ferrous metal from the ash for recycling. The remaining ash is then used as an aggregate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{prevalence}} of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) issues <b>in</b> most of <b>the</b> African {{countries have been}} attributed to the insufficient attention received from industry and government. The review of literature <b>in</b> <b>the</b> existing body of knowledge becomes paramount on the subject matter. The road map for the identification of occupational health and safety practices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ghanaian <b>construction</b> <b>industry</b> was obtained through literature review. Studies relevant to OHS practices were selected out of the numerous studies reviewed, through a rigorous process. The results from the literature study were analysed to obtain specific issues that are relevant to <b>the</b> OHS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ghanaian <b>construction</b> <b>industry.</b> Based on <b>the</b> identified practices, needs are clearly defined and strategies are proposed to come out with appropriate solutions for health and safety improvements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ghanaian <b>construction</b> <b>industry.</b> Findings from <b>the</b> study show that ignorance and lack of interest in dealing with OHS issues in Ghana is one of the contributing factors to the OHS challenging. It is concluded that proactive measures should be provided at all levels of organisations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country to deal with OHS issues. There should also be the establishment of OHS culture robust enough to deal with all issues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. Serious attention should be given to effective OHS management in order to eliminate accident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>industries...</b>|$|R
