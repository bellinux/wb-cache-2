2500|$|LaMarr {{auditioned for}} Tarantino because both {{had done a}} show for the Groundlings, an improv group, {{a few months before}} casting of the film began. In the audition, he read for Jules Winnfield and Brett. He {{described}} the filming experience of Pulp Fiction as [...] "the coolest, most easygoing, fun set I've ever been on ... Tarantino was fantastic. I mean, he can be almost unbearable as a person. At a party, you can't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> edgewise for, like, an hour. But as a director, he is so completely open and just... present. And he treated everybody on set well." ...|$|E
2500|$|French took on {{responsibility}} for air defence, although {{he agreed with}} Repington that it was [...] "a damnosa hereditas". He was frequently lobbied by local groups for better air defences. In January 1917 anti-aircraft guns were reallocated to anti-submarine warfare. [...] After the Gotha raids in July 1917 French {{was able to make}} a fuss at the War Cabinet (Robertson complained he could not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> edgeways) and show letters he had written urging greater priority for air defence. [...] A War Cabinet sub-committee was set up, nominally chaired by the Prime Minister but effectively run by J. C. Smuts, and French urged that air be treated as a separate department going forward (which eventually became the RAF). [...] More guns and fighter squadrons were provided, and Brigadier E.B. Ashmore was appointed to command London's air defence, reporting to French.|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Steve Leggett states [...] "It's all Jimmy Smith in full flight, {{bubbling}} over with cascading notes and breathless detours, {{and if his}} studio work is generally more structured and considered (but {{only a little more}} so), this set shows him in what was his natural habitat, astounding an audience in a small club. Bailey keeps up with things and Schwartz <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> now and then, but this is Smith's show all the way".|$|R
60|$|This is the {{question}} of all time. And as long as man and woman endure, so will the answer be given, first one way, then the other. Man, as the utterer, usually claims that Eve was created out of his spare rib: from the field of the creative, upper dynamic consciousness, that is. But woman, as soon as she <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>in,</b> points to the fact that man inevitably, poor darling, is the issue of his mother's womb. So the battle rages.|$|R

60|$|But Mr. Brewster was not {{permitted}} to postpone the interview. Before {{he could get his}} breath, Salvatore had begun to talk. He was a strong, ambidextrous talker, whom it was hard to interrupt; and it was not for some moments that Mr. Brewster succeeded <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>in.</b> When he did, he spoke to the point. Though not a linguist, {{he had been able to}} follow the discourse closely enough to realise that the waiter was dissatisfied with conditions in his hotel; and Mr. Brewster, as has been indicated, had a short way with people who criticised the Cosmopolis.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} an operation of inserting contexts <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> controlled by <b>a</b> contextual scheme X {{which provides a}} selection criterion for contextual insertion. We say that a language L is k-stable w. r. t. a contextual scheme X if by making any k context insertions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> of L we still obtain <b>a</b> <b>word</b> of L; L is k-anti-stable w. r. t. X if by making any k context insertions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> of L we <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> not <b>in</b> L; L is called k-error-correctable w. r. t. X if by making any k context insertions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> x of L we <b>get</b> either <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> L or <b>a</b> <b>word</b> not <b>in</b> L which cannot be also obtained by making k context insertions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> z of L different from x. We prove that all these properties are decidable for regular languages. We then define a distance between two words that measures the minimal number of context insertions {{in one of the}} <b>words</b> <b>in</b> order to obtain the other. Some properties of this distance, which is actually a semimetric, are investigated. Â© 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{problematic}} of public {{space at the}} edge of modernity in Kramerius newspapers in Czech. The first part gatheres together the results from existing research literature, discusses the question of the relationship between modernity and postmodernity that leads to the theoretical and methodological background of authors approach. The second part deals with the influences that shape the final content of Kramerius' Newspapers. Newspapers are seen {{as part of a broader}} discursive network. It is also the reader, who <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> process of establishing the final content. Among other, this chapter focuses on the issue of creating a community of readers and the public sphere in Bohemia in the late 18 th century as a preconditon for ethnic or even the national identity. The last part concentrates on specific topics in Kramerius' Newspapers, the reporting and processing techniques, which aim is to shape the reader and his view on observed events. The work ends with a statement that Kramerius' Newspapers by the content as well as form created a wider readership community, which maintained a certain social ties and also shared a certain form of the public sphere. However, the analysis of themes and data processing techniques revealed the boundaries of this community. The community can not [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Salvatore Frank Ruggiero {{was born}} in East New York, Brooklyn, to a first {{generation}} Italian immigrant John Ruggiero Jr. from Torre de Ruggiero in Catanzaro, Calabria, Italy and an Italian-American woman named Mary Dellacroce who lived in Howard Beach, Queens. Mary was the biological sister of Gambino crime family underboss Aniello Dellacroce. It is unknown if his father John Jr. {{was a member of}} organized crime and served under Albert Anastasia or Carlo Gambino. Salvatore became involved in criminal activity at a young age and joined the powerful Fulton-Rockaway Boys (and the girl Elisa) gang member like his older brother Angelo Ruggiero and John Gotti. He was a sphinx compared to his brother Angelo. It is suggested by John Volkman and Ernest Cummings that Salvatore remained quiet and subdued because he had no hope of ever <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> with his brother Angelo around. He preferred to invest his energies in a mad quest for speed. Despite two serious injuries suffered in accidents on stolen motorcycles, Salvatore loved anything that he could propel at great velocity. Said to be a maniac behind the wheel of an automobile, he taught himself to drive at the age of thirteen, and like to roar around deserted areas of Brooklyn in stolen cars.|$|R

But Neb was at the helm, and I had given him a sign to sheer further from our companion. This soon reduced the intercourse to a few wavings of handkerchiefs, and kissings of the hand, in which all the Drewetts came in for a share.
