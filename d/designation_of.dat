It {{is clear that the}} vast majority of immigrants to the city were not known by <b>designations</b> <b>of</b> origin, and that the designations used were hardly representative in terms of the origins of the immigrants at large. As reasons for this lack of representativeness, perceptions of various regions and groups and the respective places held by the <b>designations</b> <b>of</b> origin in a lexicon or onomasticon are proposed...|$|R
