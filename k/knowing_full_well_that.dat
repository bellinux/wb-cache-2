60|$|Reader, this {{following}} {{account of}} the people called Quakers, &c. {{was written in the}} fear and love of God: first, as a standing testimony to that ever blessed truth in the inward parts, with which God, in my youthful time, visited my soul, and for the sense and love of which I was made willing, in no ordinary way, to relinquish the honours and interests of the world. Secondly, as a testimony for that despised people, that God has in his great mercy gathered and united by his own blessed Spirit in the holy profession of it; whose fellowship I value above all worldly greatness. Thirdly, in love and honour to the memory of that worthy servant of God, George Fox, the first instrument thereof, and therefore styled by me--The great and blessed apostle of our day. As this gave birth to what is here presented to thy view, in the first edition of it, by way of preface to George Fox's excellent Journal; so the consideration of the present usefulness of the following {{account of the}} people called Quakers, by reason of the unjust reflections of some adversaries that once walked under the profession of Friends, and the exhortations that conclude it, prevailed with me to consent that it should be republished in a smaller volume; <b>knowing</b> also <b>full</b> <b>well,</b> <b>that</b> great books, especially in these days, grow burthensome, both to the pockets and minds of too many; and that there are not a few that desire, so it be at an easy rate, to be informed about this people, that have been so much every where spoken against: but blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, it is upon no worse grounds than it was said of old time of the primitive Christians, as I hope will appear to every sober and considerate reader. Our business, after all the ill usage we have met with, being the realities of religion, an effectual change before our last and great change: that all may come to an inward, sensible, and experimental knowledge of God, through the convictions and operations of the light and spirit of Christ in themselves; the sufficient and blessed means given to all, that thereby all may come savingly to know the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent to enlighten and redeem the world: which knowledge is indeed eternal life. And that thou, reader, mayst obtain it, is the earnest desire of him that is ever thine in so good a work.|$|R

A published synopsis: Set in August, 1896, Sherlock Holmes expounds at great length on his occult beliefs and invites Watson to a (spiritualism based) séance. Lestrade & Macintosh take Holmes & Watson to the home of Sir Randolph Gretzinger, former Ambassador to Persia, who has been murdered along with his servant. Holmes finds a copy of the Bayán in Gretzinger's hand, and he expounds at length on Bábism. Side note: Holmes is presented as having a high regard for the religion and being current on its situation enough to know that [...] "Abo ol-Baha" [...] is a political prisoner at that time and <b>knowing</b> <b>full</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> the religion would never associate with such a plot having already suffered many martyrs and known to not organize any rebellion and instead maintained a peaceful, unified vision with all mankind. He deduces that the men have been injected with poison (from small wounds in their thumbs), and expounds at length on snake venom. The following day they are summoned to the Diogenes Club, where Mycroft expounds at great length on the politics of petroleum and how this may be the true reason for the murder. After visiting the dead man's widow and urging her to continue his oil negotiations with the Shah of Persia Holmes is visited by representatives of the Bahá'í Faith who fear that the book was planted on the body to implicate them. They expound at length on the assassination of the last Shah and feel an effort is being made to frame them, but Holmes assures them he is well aware of the reputation of the Bahá'ís and believes in their innocence. Holmes & Watson are invited to a séance and Holmes expounds at length on the other guests. At the séance a spirit claiming to be Moriarty hurls a dagger at Holmes. Holmes organizes London Baha'is into a [...] "Baker Street Baha'i", including ones in the Russian Embassy, to locate Gretzinger's missing appointment book from which Holmes is able to learn the murderer's name and establish the innocence of the Bahá'ís.|$|E
2500|$|Fritz Sauckel, the General Plenipotentiary for Labour Deployment, {{making him}} {{the man in charge}} of {{bringing}} slaves to the factories in Germany demanded the flight of young men to the countryside be stopped and called the maquis [...] "terrorists", [...] "bandits" [...] and [...] "criminals" [...] for their unwillingness to become slaves. The extent of popular resistance to the STO law can be seen in that one of every two French people who should have served in the STO failed to do so. Sauckel had been ordered by Hitler in February 1943 to produce half million workers from France for German industry no later than March 1943, and it was he who had pressured Laval to create the STO with the law of 16 February 1943. Sauckel had joined the NSDAP in 1923, making him an Alter Kämpfer (Old Fighter), and like many other Alte Kämpfer (who tended to the most extreme Nazis), Sauckel was a hard man. Despite warnings from Laval, Sauckel took the view that he was ordered by Albert Speer to produce a quota of slaves for German industry, that the men joining the maquis were sabotaging German industry by fleeing to the countryside rather than going to work as slaves in Germany and the solution was simply to kill them all, so he could meet his quota. Sauckel believed that once the maquis were wiped out, Frenchmen would obediently report to the STO and go to work in Germany. When Laval was presented with Sauckel's latest demand for French labor for German industry, he remarked: [...] "Have you been sent by de Gaulle?". Laval argued the réfractaries were not political opponents and should not be treated as such, arguing that an amnesty and a promise that the réfractaries would not be sent as slaves to Germany would nip the budding maquis movement. As Laval predicated, the hardline policies that Sauckel advocated turned the basically apolitical maquis political, driving them straight into the resistance as the maquisards turned to the established resistance groups to ask for arms and training. Sauckel decided that if Frenchmen would not report to the STO, he would have the Todt organisation use the shanghaillage (shanghaiing) the French by storming into cinemas to arrest the patrons or raiding villages in search of bodies to turn into slaves to meet the quotas imposed by Speer. Otto Abetz, the Francophile German ambassador to Vichy had also warned that Sauckel was driving the maquis into the resistance with his hardline policies and once joked to Sauckel that the maquis should put up a statue of him with the inscription [...] "To our number one recruitment agent". The French called Sauckel [...] "the slave-trader". Furthermore, as Laval warned, the scale of the problem was beyond Vichy's means to solve. The prefets of the departments of the Lozère, the Hérault, the Aude, the Pyréénées-Orientales, and Aveyron had been given a list of 853 réfractaries to arrest, and managed during the next four months to arrest only 1 réfractarie. After the Battle of Stalingrad, which ended with the destruction of the entire German 6th Army in February 1943, many had started to doubt the inevitability of an Axis victory, and most French gendarmes were not willing to hunt the down the maquis, <b>knowing</b> <b>full</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> they might be tried for their actions if the Allies won. Only the men of the Groupe mobile de réserve para-military police force were considered reliable, but the force was too small for the task of hunting down thousands of men. As the Germans as much as possible preferred to subcontract the work of ruling France to the French while retaining ultimate control it was the Milice that was given the task of destroying the maquis. The Milice was in Ousby's words [...] "Vichy's only instrument for fighting the Maquis. Entering the popular vocabulary at more or less the same time, the words maquis and milice together defined the new realities: the one a little-known word for the back country of Corsica, which became a synonym for militant resistance; the other a familiar word meaning simply [...] "militia", which became a synonym for militant repression. The Maquis and the Milice were enemies thrown up by the final chaos of the Occupation, in a sense twins symbiotically linked in a final hunt".|$|E
