40|$|Abstract: This work aims {{to study}} the {{transient}} electric field radiating by two different generators of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges,</b> which are constructed according to the Standard related to <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges.</b> Measurements of the electric field generated by contact <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges</b> a few centimetres away from the discharge point are presented. With the aberration to the Standard that the current transducer is mounted on an insulating material instead of a metal plate a closer simulation to real <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges</b> is obtained. Measurements proved that there are differences from generator to generator and also differences at the same generator, depending on its orientation...|$|R

40|$|We present new {{results on}} <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges</b> in fully {{depleted}} SOI MOSFETs struck by heavy ions. We investigate {{the sensitivity of}} irradiated MOSFETs to discharges applied both at the gate and drain terminals. A single heavy-ion strike is shown to reduce the ESD breakdown voltage and enhance the probability of generating source-drain filaments for gate ESD events, while leaving the sensitivity to drain events unchanged. Radiation-induced latent damage in the gate oxide and defects in the silicon body are pointed out as possible reasons for the modified response to <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges</b> after irradiation...|$|R

25|$|Static {{electricity}} and electric current are two separate phenomena. They both involve electric charge, and may occur simultaneously {{in the same}} object. Static electricity refers to the electric charge of an object and the related <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharge</b> when two objects are brought together that are not at equilibrium. An <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharge</b> creates {{a change in the}} charge of each of the two objects. In contrast, electric current is the flow of electric charge through an object, which produces no net loss or gain of electric charge.|$|E
25|$|The spark {{associated}} with static electricity {{is caused by}} <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharge,</b> or simply static discharge, as excess charge is neutralized by a flow of charges from or to the surroundings.|$|E
40|$|A {{search of}} Voyager {{spacecraft}} plasma wave data {{for evidence of}} Saturn <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges,</b> whose detection was suggested to be likely {{on the basis of}} radio astronomy observations, has yielded no evidence of this phenomenon. The statistical significance of this null result is analyzed, and its ramifications are commented upon. The explanations entertained for the lack of plasma wave observations of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges</b> include the possibility that many events are of much shorter duration than previously reported, or {{that there may be a}} nonlinear distortion in the radio astronomy receiver employed which may have artificially broadened the spectrum of the discharges...|$|R
40|$|Looking at the German and Dutch statistics, the {{percentage}} of dust explosions in all industries dealing with explosible dust-air mixtures which have been ignited by <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges</b> is about 8 - 10 %. However, in the plastics industry this value is much higher: 25 %. In particular {{in the last few}} years some rather large industrial incidents probably have been caused by electrostatic charges. To understand why accidents may happen due to static electricity the several dangerous <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges</b> will be discussed briefly in connection with dust explosion hazards. In particular the propagating brush discharge and the cone or " Maurer " discharge are important. Ignitions are caused mainly in the case of easily ignitable powders or hybrid mixtures (powders in combination with flammable vapours) due to isolated conductors and non-conducting materials as the product itself or such process parts as flexible hoses, internally coated silos and ducts. To illustrate how hazards by <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges</b> may develop in real life both on a small and a large scale a few examples will be briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This work {{presents}} a novel method based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) for {{the prediction of}} the transient electromagnetic field radiating by generators of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges</b> constructed according to an IEC standard. Actual input and output data collected from measurements {{carried out in the}} High Voltage Laboratory of the National Technical University of Athens are used in the training, validation and testing process. The proposed ANN method which can easy and accurate assesses the electromagnetic field produced by <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges</b> by simply measuring the discharge current can be used by laboratories facing either a lack of suitable ESD test equipment or want to compare the results to their own measurements...|$|R
25|$|In {{order for}} an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharge</b> to occur, two {{preconditions}} are necessary: firstly, a sufficiently high electric potential between two regions of space must exist, and secondly a high-resistance medium must obstruct the free, unimpeded equalization {{of the opposite}} charges.|$|E
25|$|The fragile {{insulating}} {{layer of the}} MOSFET between the gate and channel makes it vulnerable to <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharge</b> or changes to threshold voltage during handling. This is not usually a problem after the device has been installed in a properly designed circuit.|$|E
25|$|Multi-layer {{varistor}} (MLV) devices provide <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharge</b> {{protection to}} electronic circuits from low to medium energy transients in sensitive equipment operating at 0-120 volts dc. They have peak current ratings from about 20 to 500 amperes, and peak energy ratings from 0.05 to 2.5 joules.|$|E
40|$|Low-temperature sinter of {{semiconductor}} and {{polymer resin}} {{is useful in}} manufacture of circuit boards, cables, and electroexplosive devices. Material can absorb large amounts of heat and can withstand repeated exposures to <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges</b> with little deteriorating effects. These characteristics offer significant advantages over high-temperature-sintered, metal-oxide semiconducting materials...|$|R
25|$|The flowing {{movement}} of flammable liquids like gasoline inside a pipe can build up static electricity. Non-polar liquids such as gasoline, toluene, xylene, diesel, kerosene and light crude oils exhibit significant ability for charge accumulation and charge retention during high velocity flow. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>discharges</b> can ignite the fuel vapor.|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, conductive tethers {{have failed}} from unexpected current surges. Unexpected <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges</b> have cut tethers (e.g. see Tethered Satellite System Reflight (TSS‑1R) on STS‑75), damaged electronics, and welded tether handling machinery. It {{may be that}} the Earth's magnetic field is not as homogeneous as some engineers have believed.|$|R
25|$|<b>Electrostatic</b> <b>discharge</b> while fueling with {{gasoline}} is a present danger at gas stations. Fires {{have also been}} started at airports while refueling aircraft with kerosene. New grounding technologies, the use of conducting materials, {{and the addition of}} anti-static additives help to prevent or safely dissipate the buildup of static electricity.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{electrostatic}} phenomena {{are most}} familiar as an occasional annoyance in seasons of low humidity, {{but can be}} destructive and harmful in some situations (e.g. electronics manufacturing). When working {{in direct contact with}} integrated circuit electronics (especially delicate MOSFETs), or in the presence of flammable gas, care must be taken to avoid accumulating and suddenly discharging a static charge (see <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharge).</b>|$|E
25|$|The bipolar {{point-contact}} transistor {{was invented}} in December 1947 at the Bell Telephone Laboratories by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain {{under the direction of}} William Shockley. The junction version known as the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), invented by Shockley in 1948, was for three decades the device of choice in the design of discrete and integrated circuits. Nowadays, the use of the BJT has declined in favor of CMOS technology in the design of digital integrated circuits. The incidental low performance BJTs inherent in CMOS ICs, however, are often utilized as bandgap voltage reference, silicon bandgap temperature sensor and to handle <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharge.</b>|$|E

50|$|In contrast, a {{very low}} {{humidity}} level favors the build-up of static electricity, which may result in spontaneous shutdown of computers when discharges occur. Apart from spurious erratic function, <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges</b> can cause dielectric breakdown in solid state devices, resulting in irreversible damage. Data centers often monitor relative humidity levels for these reasons.|$|R
25|$|Because the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharge</b> of {{terrestrial}} lightning superheats {{the air to}} plasma temperatures {{along the length of}} the discharge channel in a short duration, kinetic theory dictates gaseous molecules undergo a rapid increase in pressure and thus expand outward from the lightning creating a shock wave audible as thunder. Since the sound waves propagate not from a single point source but {{along the length of the}} lightning's path, the sound origin's varying distances from the observer can generate a rolling or rumbling effect. Perception of the sonic characteristics is further complicated by factors such as the irregular and possibly branching geometry of the lightning channel, by acoustic echoing from terrain, and by the typically multiple-stroke characteristic of the lightning strike.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the YF-17, {{which had}} {{hydromechanical}} controls {{serving as a}} backup to the FBW, General Dynamics took the innovative step of eliminating mechanical linkages between the control stick and rudder pedals, and the flight control surfaces. The F-16 is entirely reliant on its electrical systems to relay flight commands, instead of traditional mechanically-linked controls, leading to the early moniker of [...] "the electric jet". The quadruplex design permits [...] "graceful degradation" [...] in flight control response in {{that the loss of}} one channel renders the FLCS a [...] "triplex" [...] system. The FLCC began as an analog system on the A/B variants, but has been supplanted by a digital computer system beginning with the F-16C/D Block 40. The F-16's controls suffered from a sensitivity to static electricity or <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharge</b> (ESD). Up to 70–80% of the C/D models' electronics were vulnerable to ESD.|$|E
2500|$|Lightning is {{a sudden}} <b>electrostatic</b> <b>{{discharge}}</b> that occurs during a thunderstorm.

2500|$|Optical {{fingerprint}} imaging involves capturing {{a digital}} {{image of the}} print using visible light. [...] This type of sensor is, in essence, a specialized type of digital camera. [...] The top layer of the sensor, where the finger is placed, {{is known as the}} touch surface. [...] Beneath this layer is a light-emitting phosphor layer which illuminates the surface of the finger. [...] The light reflected from the finger passes through the phosphor layer to an array of solid state pixels (a charge-coupled device) which captures a visual image of the fingerprint. [...] A scratched or dirty touch surface can cause a bad image of the fingerprint. [...] A disadvantage of this type of sensor {{is the fact that the}} imaging capabilities are affected by the quality of skin on the finger. [...] For instance, a dirty or marked finger is difficult to image properly. [...] Also, it is possible for an individual to erode the outer layer of skin on the fingertips to the point where the fingerprint is no longer visible. It can also be easily fooled by an image of a fingerprint if not coupled with a [...] "live finger" [...] detector. However, unlike capacitive sensors, this sensor technology is not susceptible to <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharge</b> damage.|$|E

For example, AGFA coats 200 million photographic films per year with a thin, extensively-stretched layer of virtually transparent and colorless PEDOT:PSS as an antistatic agent to prevent <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges</b> during production and normal film use, independent of humidity conditions, and as electrolyte in polymer electrolytic capacitors.|$|R
40|$|Large vessels {{containing}} electrostatically charged flammable mists or dust clouds {{form part}} of many industrial processes. Consequently, high internal space potentials and electric fields are possible, promoting <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges.</b> The risk of ignition is often addressed by nitrogen inertion or by adding explosion protection systems. A preferred cost-effective alternative is to analyse the process {{with the aim of}} determining the maximum electric field that can be generated inside the vessel, for comparison with breakdown strength of air at which <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges</b> can occur. This field can seldom be measured directly. It can, however, be determined by performing simple measurements of the charge concentration and vessel dimensions to model the electrostatic conditions using a finite element, field analysis package. The package has been routinely used in hazard analyses by Wolfson Electrostatics, allowing the potential distributions and electric fields inside vessels to be displayed, using interactive graphics, as contour lines, vectors or graphs.
