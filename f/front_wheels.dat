5|$|Another {{variation}} on the theme was produced later in the season. Like the BT46B, the BT46C removed the radiators from the front wing assembly leaving a clean aerodynamic wing and moving the centre of gravity further back again. The standard radiators were replaced by units from a Volkswagen Golf mounted behind the <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> out of the airstream in a region of positive pressure.|$|E
5|$|Stephenson {{built the}} {{locomotive}} originally as an 0-4-0 (an 0-4-0 is the Whyte notation for a steam locomotive with two powered axles and no unpowered leading or trailing axles). The locomotive's power was {{transmitted to the}} driving axles through pistons that were mounted under the boiler between the two <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> {{and in front of}} the front axle. These inside cylinders' main rods were connected to a rear crank axle with a connecting rod between the two axles to power the front axle.|$|E
5|$|Tauranac signed double world {{champion}} Graham Hill and young Australian Tim Schenken to drive for the 1971 season. Tauranac designed the unusual 'lobster claw' BT34, featuring twin radiators mounted {{ahead of the}} <b>front</b> <b>wheels,</b> a single example of which was built for Hill. Although Hill, no longer a front-runner since his 1969 accident, took his final Formula One win in the non-championship BRDC International Trophy at Silverstone, the team scored only sevenchampionship points.|$|E

2500|$|Bumpy surfaces: If the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> {{comes off}} the ground during braking, it will stop completely. [...] Landing on a stopped <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> with the brakes still applied is likely to cause the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> to skid and may flip the rider over the handlebar.|$|R

5|$|The mid-engine {{complicated}} {{the design of}} the four-wheel drive system, and an innovative solution was needed to get drive {{from the rear of the}} engine to the <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b> The chosen design took the front-wheel drive from the central differential on the rear transaxle and sent it through the V in the centre of the engine using a quill drive, before joining an inverted differential. The clutch was a twin-plate unit designed by AP Racing.|$|E
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that gentle turns used just the steerable <b>front</b> <b>wheels,</b> but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had the track-saving but more complicated rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of five double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the Schachtellaufwerk layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front axle had transversely mounted leaf springs and shock absorbers - the only ones on the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that shallow turns used only the wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of six double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the usual Schachtellaufwerk system used for German half-track vehicles, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> had leaf springs and shock absorbers.|$|E
500|$|When braking is {{increasing}} {{the center of}} mass m may move forward relative to the <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> as the rider moves forward relative to the bike, and, if the bike has suspension on the <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> the <b>front</b> forks compress under load, changing the bike geometry. This all puts extra load on the <b>front</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The special <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> {{contains}} a rotating flywheel {{driven by a}} rechargeable-battery-powered motor that spins at high RPMs like a gyroscope. This flywheel spins significantly faster than the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> rolls and acts as a gyroscope, even when the bike is moving slowly, such as when the rider is starting. The flywheel causes the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> {{to respond to a}} lean by precessing, that is the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> turns toward the direction of the lean, which can help provide stability at low speeds, whether riding straight or turning.|$|R
5|$|Slippery {{surfaces}} or bumpy surfaces. Under <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> braking, {{the lower}} {{coefficient of friction}} may cause the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> to skid which often results {{in a loss of}} balance.|$|R
5|$|River {{traffic and}} {{railroad}} traffic were increasingly {{in competition with}} each other. In October 1879 a disaster was narrowly avoided when a seven-coach passenger train with 800 people on board approached the open swing bridge too fast and was barely able to stop in time, ending up with its <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> hanging off the approach road over the river. Meanwhile, boats on the river were getting larger and finding {{it increasingly difficult to}} navigate the bridges {{at the mouth of the}} north branch, so the Army Corps of Engineers ordered the clearing of three swing bridges near Kinzie Street that were obstructing river traffic. Therefore, in 1907 construction started on a new bascule bridge that would allow more space for boats to pass by on the river.|$|E
5|$|Wobble, shimmy, tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and death}} wobble are all {{words and phrases}} used to {{describe}} a rapid (410Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front wheel, fork, and handlebars). Also involved is the yawing of the rear frame which {{may contribute to the}} wobble when too flexible. This instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b> While wobble or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the handlebar, it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|For {{the climactic}} tanker chase, the {{producers}} used an entire {{section of a}} highway near Mexicali, which had been closed for safety reasons. Sixteen eighteen-wheeler tankers were used, some with modifications made by manufacturer Kenworth {{at the request of}} driving stunts arranger Rémy Julienne. Most were given improvements to their engines to run faster, while one model had an extra steering wheel {{on the back of the}} cabin so a hidden stuntman could drive while Carey Lowell was in the front and another received extra suspension on its back so it could lift its <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b> Although a rig was constructed to help a rig tilt onto its side, it was not necessary as Julienne was able to pull off the stunt without the aid of camera trickery.|$|E
5000|$|The Vélosolex has a [...] motor mounted {{above the}} <b>front</b> <b>wheel.</b> Power is {{delivered}} via a small ceramic roller that rotates {{directly on the}} <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> by friction to the tire.|$|R
25|$|One {{effect of}} turning the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> is a roll moment caused by {{gyroscopic}} precession. The magnitude of this moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of the <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|R
5000|$|One common {{arrangement}} is an ISO 559 (26-inch) rear wheel and an ISO 406 or ISO 451 (20-inch) <b>front</b> <b>wheel.</b> The small <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> and large rear wheel combination {{is used to}} keep the pedals and <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> clear of each other, avoiding the problem on a short wheelbase recumbent called [...] "heel strike" [...] (where the rider's heels catch the wheel in tight turns). A pivoting-boom front-wheel drive (PBFWD aka Moving Bottom Bracket recumbent) configuration also overcomes heel strike since the pedals and <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> turn together. PBFWD bikes may have dual 26 in wheels or larger.|$|R
5|$|Razer's four-wheeled {{drive train}} used a skid-steering arrangement, whereby the wheels {{on one side}} of the robot rotated faster than those on the other to turn the machine. Also, the weight of the robot was biased towards the rear so that its weapon stayed facing its {{opponent}} as Razer turned. However, the solid rubber rear wheels used in series two provided too much traction and were reluctant to 'swing' the machine. For the third series, Razer used custom-made aluminium drive wheels which incorporated rollers, reducing the amount of force required for simultaneous forward and sideways movement. These wheels were later upgraded with a stronger titanium construction, whilst the level of oversteer in the drive system was reduced through the implementation of an electronic gyroscope. For the series Robot Wars Extreme II, Razer's rubber <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> were replaced with metal ones bearing small spiked protrusions.|$|E
5|$|Some early T-26 {{tanks were}} {{repaired}} in tank units or factories {{with the use}} of later production parts. This meant replacing the all-rubber road wheels (except the <b>front</b> <b>wheels)</b> and track idlers with new strengthened ones. Armour was added for the headlight, the armour thickness of the driver's hatch lower door of the twin-turreted tanks was increased from 6 to 10mm and armoured PT-1 or PTK observation devices were installed. A common hatch above the engine, oil tank, and fuel tank was mounted starting in May 1940. In 1940, 255 T-26s were modernised in this way and {{in the first half of}} 1941 another 85 tanks were improved. A central factory responsible for the T-26's repair and modernisation was the Factory of Carrying-and-Conveying Machines named after S. Kirov in Leningrad, and the Factory No. 105 named after L. Kaganovich in Khabarovsk from the beginning of the Great Patriotic War until 1945.|$|E
5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the <b>front</b> <b>wheels,</b> is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E

5|$|In New Zealand, Mouton {{continued}} her good performances and traded the lead with Mikkola, Röhrl and Björn Waldegård. Soon after regaining {{the lead on}} stage twelve, she retired with a broken oil pump. After seven rounds, Mouton was second in the championship, 32 points behind Röhrl and 12 ahead of Eklund. The Rally of Brazil was marred by the fatal accident of Brazilian driver Thomas Fuchs, and featured chaotic conditions as parts of the course were not successfully closed for competition. Although only five teams {{made it to the}} finish, Mouton improved her title hopes by winning her duel with Röhrl after the German lost a wheel on the last day. At the 1000 Lakes, she clocked in the eighth fastest time for the famous Ouninpohja stage and placed seventh after the first day. On the following leg, Mouton drove too fast into a jump and damaged her Quattro while landing. After the next jump, her <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> locked up and she rolled the car. Mouton was next locked in a tight battle for the win in Sanremo. Although she recorded nine stage wins and Audi took a one-two, she had to settle for fourth behind Röhrl.|$|E
5|$|Upfront, the No. 5 Toyota {{increased}} its lead over the No. 8 Audi to 38.778 seconds, {{while the first}} Audi moved into 12th position. The No. 1 Porsche returned to the pit lane {{for a change of}} front axel and fell down the order in LMP1 because of different tyre speeds of the vehicle's <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b> G-Drive's No. 38 entry was issued with a two-minute stop-and-go penalty for its role in the collision with the No. 95 Aston Martin. Fässler nearly placed Davidson into the grass at Stavelot while lapping Extreme Speed Motorsports's Ligier. Fässler entered the pit lane for replacement front bodywork. Gulf's Porsche entry spun after contact with Emmanuel Collard's Ferrari at Rivage. The second full course caution was later necessitated when debris was located on three sections of the track. Davidson remained the leader at the restart, ahead of Duval, and immediately increased his advantage over the Audi driver. The No. 7 car hit the No. 36 Alpine at La Source, causing the latter to spin. The third round of pit stops commenced shortly afterwards when Audi and Toyota made their stops for fuel and driver changes. Kraihamer's No. 13 Rebellion Racing vehicle hit the LMP2 leader Tor Graves in the No. 44 Manor Oreca and his car was beached on La Source's apex {{for a long period of}} time before rejoining the event.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} 75 minutes. The cars were {{split into two}} groups with the leading championship point-standing leaders and the fastest two drivers from the previous road course race composing the second group. Both groups were allowed 30 minutes on the circuit with a 15-minute break in {{between the two groups}} recording their lap times. Weather conditions were warm for the 75-minute session. De Ferran clinched his first pole position of the season, his second at Toronto, and the twelfth of his career with a time of 57.703 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by teammate Castroneves and had the pole position until de Ferran's lap. Bräck qualified third, Kanaan fourth and Tagliani fifth (all three drivers went off into the track's run-off areas but continued without damaging their cars.) Franchitti, Fernández, Tracy, Roberto Moreno and Scott Dixon rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Servià was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten; his best lap time was 0.534 seconds off de Ferran's pace. He was followed by Carpentier in twelfth. Andretti, 13th, slid and hit the turn one tire barrier lightly with the left front section of his nose cone; he later contacted the turn five wall with his right-rear tire on his final timed lap. Fittipaldi took 14th position, ahead of Herta who spun at turn nine without damaging his car. Vasser, da Matta, Michel Jourdain Jr., Gugelmin, Junqueira filled the next five places on the grid. Papis took 21st and was joined by Tora Takagi on the grid's eleventh row. 23rd-place qualifier Gidley made contact with Carpentier who was braking heavily for the turn eight right-hander and Gidley damaged his front suspension heavily with his <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> out of line. Both drivers were unhurt. Zanardi took 24th position. Wilson and Nakano qualified {{at the back of the}} grid in 25th and 26th places; Wilson closely followed Nakano on his first timed lap made heavy contact with the rear-left of Nakano's car and went airborne briefly. Both drivers were uninjured but switched to their back-up cars as their primary chassis were heavily damaged.|$|E
