The man eventually discovers the fox's true nature, and the fox-wife is forced to leave him. In some cases, the husband wakes as if <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream,</b> filthy, disoriented, and far from home. He must then return to confront his abandoned family in shame.|$|E

5|$|The episode's opening scene, {{featuring}} a camera moving slowly towards Scully in a harsh white light, {{was achieved by}} constructing a long narrow set covered in aluminium foil, which amplified the light being used and downplayed any colors.

25|$|Upon {{returning}} to his village, Don Quixote announces his plan to retire to the countryside as a shepherd, but his housekeeper urges him to stay at home. Soon after, he retires to his bed with a deathly illness, and later awakes <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream,</b> having fully recovered his sanity. Sancho tries to restore his faith, but Quixano (his proper name) only renounces his previous ambition and apologizes for the harm he has caused. He dictates his will, which includes a provision that his niece will be disinherited if she marries a man who reads books of chivalry. After Alonso Quixano dies, the author emphasizes {{that there are no}} more adventures to relate and that any further books about Don Quixote would be spurious.|$|E

They are attacked in the night by Gollum, former owner of the Ring, but they capture him. Sympathising with Gollum, for what he perceives as their shared burden, Frodo asks Gollum to lead them safely to Mordor, despite Sam’s objections. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue the Uruk-hai, who kidnapped their friends Merry and Pippin. The Uruk-hai are slaughtered by the Rohirrim, army of Rohan, but the two Hobbits escape into Fangorn Forest, where they meet the Ent Treebeard. Aragorn’s group later meet the Rohirrim, who have been banished by their king Théoden, who is being manipulated by Saruman’s servant Grima Wormtongue.

25|$|The remake {{version of}} the video is about a person who loses touch with himself. Originally full of life, the protagonist becomes a robot working a {{monotonous}} office job. One morning, he wakes up <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> of a beautiful girl dressed in white on the beach. He leaves for work, and his buried alter egos, dressed in white shirts, black slacks, assorted ties and each holding either red or white roses, emerge mysteriously. At work, his boss gives him a stack of paperwork, which he does mechanically. Meanwhile, at home, the alter egos are {{in a circle around}} his coffee table, throw the roses in the center, and leave. Back at work, he prepares to go home, but is then given another stack of documents. His frustrations boil over, and he throws his tie at his boss. He runs home not knowing what he is running for, and at the moment that he walks in the door, the last of the alter egos exits. He finds a white box that replaced his coffee table and is intrigued. He unwraps the red and white ribbons and opens the box to find himself on the beach with the same girl in his dream and the roses on the water.|$|E

When the students {{take a trip}} to the nearby Château de Rochambeau, for example, Lambert, who has never visited the château, nevertheless recalls vivid memories of the place <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream.</b> Believing his spirit visited the place while his body slept, he ascribes the experience to [...] "a complete severance of my body and my inner being" [...] and [...] "some inscrutable locomotive faculty in the spirit with effects resembling those of locomotion in the body".|$|E
500|$|Joseph Bruce uses {{elements}} of political hip hop throughout the album. Many of his lyrics {{were derived from}} his experiences {{of growing up in}} a poor family that was neglected by the government. He and his brother Robert used to escape from their impoverished reality by gathering themselves in a forest called [...] "Picker Forest". Joe cites [...] "Picker Forest" [...] as a strong influence on the Dark Carnival mythology which began with this album.

500|$|A {{man named}} Vukota said these words to Bishop Danilo, {{one of the}} main {{characters}} of The Mountain Wreath, who previously uttered a piercing vision speaking as if he was alone. The second and the third verses can be compared with an idiomatic expression whose literal sense is [...] "to dash into a frenzied countenance", meaning [...] "to fall into a frenzied or crazed exaltation". Vukota compared Bishop Danilo's exaltation with that of a witch or a vjedogonja when their spirit flew out of their body. It was thought that the witches held an assembly each year on 1 March, and the vjedogonje mostly flew during the long autumn nights, especially when strong winds blew. After Vukota's words, Bishop Danilo started as if <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream.</b>|$|E
