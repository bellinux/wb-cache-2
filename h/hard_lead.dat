50|$|To recover {{lead from}} a battery, the battery is broken and the {{components}} are classified. The lead containing components are processed in blast furnaces for <b>hard</b> <b>lead</b> or rotary reverberatory furnaces for fine particles. The blast furnace {{is similar in}} structure to a cupola furnace used in iron foundries. The furnace is charged with slag, scrap iron, limestone, coke, oxides, dross, and reverberatory slag. The coke is used to melt and reduce the lead. Limestone reacts with impurities and floats to the top. This process also keeps the lead from oxidizing. The molten lead flows from the blast furnace into holding pots. Lead may be mixed with alloys, including antimony, tin, arsenic, copper and nickel. It is then cast into ingots.|$|E

In 1840 he began, at Blaydon, near Newcastle, to remove the impurities, consisting chiefly of antimony, from [...] "hard" [...] lead, and thus to convert it into [...] "soft" [...] lead, by means of a current of air driven over the molten metal; the impurities were oxidised, floated to the surface, and were then skimmed off. Practical improvements introduced into the process by George Burnett soon after led to the annual importation of several thousand tons of Spanish <b>hard</b> <b>lead</b> into the Tyne district, where it was purified.

The reflective PbO 2 films were found to mainly consist of the alpha (orthorhombic) phase with feather-like and orientated microstructures.

40|$|Water-induced {{degradation}} in {{soft lead}} zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric ceramics has been studied using electrochemical hydrogen charging, in which the silver electrodes of the piezoelectric ceramics is made a cathode in a 0. 01 M NaOH solution to evolve hydrogen by electrolysis of water. It is found that with increasing hydrogen charging time, the impedance at the resonance frequency Zr increases, {{and the difference between}} the resonance and anti-resonance frequency (fa - fr) decreases. The dielectric permittivity and piezoelectric coefficient d 33 decreases while the dielectric loss increases. I-V measurement shows that the resistivity decreases after hydrogen charging. These degradation behaviors in the soft piezoelectric ceramics can be explained as hydrogen incorporating into the lattice and forming hydroxy (OH-) bonds in the perovskite structure, which restrains the Ti ions from switching. The soft piezoelectric ceramics is partially depolarized after hydrogen charging which is quite different from that of <b>hard</b> <b>lead</b> zirconate titanate piezoelectric ceramics.

40|$|Three-dimensional {{modeling}} of piezoelectric devices requires a precise knowledge of piezoelectric material parameters. The commonly used piezoelectric materials {{belong to the}} 6 mm symmetry class, which have ten independent constants. In this work, a methodology to obtain precise material constants over a wide frequency band through finite element analysis of a piezoceramic disk is presented. Given an experimental electrical impedance curve and a first estimate for the piezoelectric material properties, {{the objective is to}} find the material properties that minimize the difference between the electrical impedance calculated by the finite element method and that obtained experimentally by an electrical impedance analyzer. The methodology consists of four basic steps: experimental measurement, identification of vibration modes and their sensitivity to material constants, a preliminary identification algorithm, and final refinement of the material constants using an optimization algorithm. The application of the methodology is exemplified using a <b>hard</b> <b>lead</b> zirconate titanate piezoceramic. The same methodology is applied to a soft piezoceramic. The errors in the identification of each parameter are statistically estimated in both cases, and are less than 0. 6 % for elastic constants, and less than 6. 3 % for dielectric and piezoelectric constants.

40|$|Precise and {{accurate}} measurements of neutron star masses and radii would provide valuable {{information about the}} still uncertain properties of cold matter at supranuclear densities. One promising approach to making such measurements involves analysis of the X-ray flux oscillations often seen during thermonuclear (type 1) X-ray bursts. These oscillations are almost certainly produced by emission from hotter regions on the stellar surface modulated by {{the rotation of the}} star. One consequence of the rotation is that the oscillation should appear earlier at higher photon energies than at lower energies. Ford (1999) found compelling evidence for such a <b>hard</b> <b>lead</b> in the tail oscillations of one type 1 burst from Aql X- 1. We have therefore analyzed individually the oscillations observed in the tails of the four type 1 bursts from 4 U 1636 - 536 that, when averaged, provided the strongest evidence for a soft lead in the analysis by Muno et al. (2003). We have also analyzed the oscillation observed during the superburst from this star. We find that the data from these five bursts, treated both individually and jointly, are fully consistent with a rotating hot spot model. Unfortunately, the uncertainties in these data are too large to provide interesting constraints on the mass and radius of this star. Comment: 5 pages, 1 figure, 1 tabl...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Muitiregion annular {{geometry}} {{is a basic}} {{feature of}} energy removal systems ranging from advanced heat exchangers to fission reactor fuel rods. For the symmetric cases, the heat conduction through annular regions is well defined. However, for a shift of an annular region, analysis of the system must be made in two dimensions. The {{purpose of this study}} is to characterize the steady state heat conduction through eccentric annuli through a theoretical, numerical, and experimental investigation. In the theoretical study, the analytical solutions are sought for the governing heat conduction equations. Separate polar coordinate systems are used to describe the points in the inner tube, the annular region, and the outer tube. Particular attention is given to the interface conditions by explicitly retaining continuity of the components of the heat flux vector. Within the context of the specified assumptions, the resulting solutions are general, valid for any size annular regions and any degree of eccentricity. The boundary condition on the outer tube surface can be specified by either a prescribed temperature function of angle or a convective boundary condition. A computer program is developed to perform the calculations of the two-dimensional temperature profiles within the eccentric system. This program can be verified mathematically for the concentric condition. The experimental study is designed to verify the program for eccentric situations. The experiment is a straightforward determination of the two-dimensional temperature field within the eccentric annuli. An electrical heater rod is used in the experiment. A PVC pipe is chosen as the outer tube. For the intermediate annular region, standard <b>hard</b> <b>lead</b> shot is utilized. The thermal conductivity of the packed bed of lead shot is relatively insensitive over the temperature range of interest, and the thermal conductivity of the PVC pipe is constant over the temperature range used. The study of the results between the analytical solutions and the measurements indicate that the temperature profiles within the system can be accurately predicted if an appropriate boundary condition is used. In addition to the theoretical and experimental phases, numerical aspects of the problem are also studied. Four general approaches have been used to treat the problem. The first is to approximate the heater rod surface by a ratchet. This results in an increase in the number of radial node regions required and a subsequent loss of economy. The second approach utilizes concentric regions and defines a variable conductivity within the annulus region to account for the eccentric condition. This reduces the number of radial node regions and results in saving in both computation time and core space. To eliminate the common limitation in both approaches that the eccentric displacement must be smaller than the radius of heater rod, a third approach is developed. This approach utilizes a two-dimensional, cylindrical model in which the origin of the coordinate system is located at the center of the heater rod. However, if an existing general purpose finite difference code is used, an additional effort is required to translate the temperature profiles to a new coordinate system with the origin located at the center of outer tube. An existing finite element computer code is utilized as the fourth numerical approach. A relatively coarser grid system can be used in this code and less computer running time is required...|$|E
