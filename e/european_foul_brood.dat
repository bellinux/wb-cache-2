40|$|THE {{cause of}} <b>European</b> <b>foul</b> <b>brood</b> was {{originally}} {{thought to be}} Bacillus alvei or a mixture of B. alvei and Streptococcus apis. The causative organism was later named and described by White as Bacillus pluton, a lanceolate Gram-positive bacterium.

However, White and others failed to culture B. pluton in vitro and it was afterwards considered to be a dissociant form of Bacillus alvei, of Bacterium eurydice, or of both. Others have maintained that B. pluton is a separate organism. It has been pointed out that Streptococcus pluton would be a more suitable designation than Bacillus pluton both on morphological grounds {{and in the absence of}} evidence that it forms spores.

40|$|Result of {{preliminary}} {{experiments have}} shown that <b>European</b> <b>foul</b> <b>brood</b> disease of the larval honeybee can be caused in bee colonies by spraying their brood with suspensions of Streptococcus pluton (Bacillus pluton White) and Bacterium eurydice White if the two organisms are grown together in mixed anaerobic culture; fifth subcultures of a mixed culture were usually virulent, although virulence diminished rapidly after further sub-cultivation. It {{was not possible to}} cause the disease by simultaneous inoculation with separate cultures of the two organisms. As there is a tendency for colonies of S. pluton and B. eurydice to grow within, or upon, each other on agar in anaerobic cultures, the separate cultures of each organism were subcultured five times to try to ensure the exclusion of the other. The results of these experiments showed that virulence was maintained by one or both organisms in mixed culture, but the possibility remained that only one of the organisms was pathogenic; its virulence may have been maintained by the growth of the other which may, in vivo, be a secondary invader of the diseased larva [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of Nosema disease, tracheal mites and the “pseudo-parasitic” behaviour of Cape honeybee workers when placed amongst African honeybees – {{known as the}} Cape Bee Problem – were studied over a 18 month period. Three surveys, approximately 6 months apart were done. The aims {{of this study were}} to establish the distribution and severity of the diseases and compare the disease with the presence of the Cape Bee Problem. Before this survey commenced <b>European</b> <b>Foul</b> <b>Brood</b> disease, Sacbrood (virus), Nosema, Brood nosema, and Tracheal mite have sporadically been reported in the summer rainfall region of South Africa. In the first survey 1005 colonies in 61 apiaries were surveyed, 803 colonies in 57 apiaries in the second, and 458 colonies in 41 apiaries in the third. Samples for disease and parasite analysis were taken at 4 colonies per apiary. Ten colonies per apiary were inspected for Cape Problem Bees, and samples of workers were collected and dissected at each of these colonies. Even with the addition of apiaries to 'fill-up' lost colonies during the second survey, 63 % of all colonies were lost by the third survey. There was only a small difference in colony loss between sedentary and migratory beekeepers of 22 % compared to 27 %. Nosema was more prevalent amongst commercial beekeepers and increased in migratory operations during the survey period. The percentage of colonies infected increased during the survey period from 23 % to 32 % to 34 %. The placement of colonies in Eucalyptus plantations may boost infection. Trachea mites seem to have spread quite rapidly in South Africa since its discovery. This parasitic mite was present in all regions, although in low numbers in three most northern regions. Sedentary colonies had higher levels of infestation than migratory colonies. The number of colonies infested diminished over the survey period, which may be a result of general colony loss. The Cape Problem Bee was less of a problem than anticipated. Colonies succumbed to Cape Problem Bees in all regions. When beekeepers reported high levels of infestation in their bee stocks the colonies would be dead within six months. In apiaries with low infestation the die-out was slower...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{attention}} has been given to the effect of heating in various media on the viability and virulence of the spores of Bacillus larvae, the causative agent of the honeybee disease, American <b>foul</b> <b>brood</b> (White, 1920). Few data have been reported, however, concerning temperatures above the boiling point of honey (White, 1920; Burnside, 1940 a, 1945). Under a project on sterilization of honey to permit feeding it to bees without danger of spreading disease, thermal death-time studies were conducted on spores of this organism in diluted honey over a temperature range of 100 to 140 C. The results reported here have been used {{in the development of a}} process for treatment of honey to permit feeding it to bees without danger of transmission of American <b>foul</b> <b>brood.</b> Although Burnside (1945) reported that "boiling for 30 minutes can be de-pended upon to destroy the virulence of Bacillus larvae under ordinary condi-tions", the authors have been advised (Hambleton, 1950) that any processing of honey for bee feeding must guarantee absence of viable spores of this organism, not simply destruction of virulence. Burnside (1940 a) has reviewed the literatur...|$|R
50|$|The first Government {{involvement}} {{into the}} beekeeping industry {{was in the}} 1940s when the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) regulated the provision of sugar to beekeepers under wartime rationing. The first legislation applied to beekeeping was the <b>Foul</b> <b>Brood</b> Disease of Bees Order, 1942. Since then {{there have been several}} changes in legislation; the current UK law on bees is administered under the Bees Act 1980, the Bee Disease Control Order 1992 and the Importation of bees Order 1997 as well as being governed by European law.|$|R

50|$|In 1921, Newell was {{selected}} to run the University of Florida’s College of Agriculture {{as well as its}} Experiment Station and Cooperative Extension Service. He also headed the USDA’s eradication campaign against the Mediterranean Fruit Fly in Florida in 1929. He held the title of Provost of Agriculture from 1938 until his death in October 1943. His research areas included control methods or the cotton boll weevil, Argentine ant, and American <b>foul</b> <b>brood</b> in honeybees. During his long career, he published technical papers on cotton and scale insects, apiculture, quarantine programs and procedures, and insect eradication. Dr. Newell had a particular interest in ant taxonomy, but also conducted pioneering research on boll weevil control in Louisiana and maintained a deep interest in apiary work in Texas and other states. However, he was best known for his activities in control and eradication of plant pests. He directed eradication from Florida of the Mediterranean fruit fly, citrus canker, and citrus blackfly. He also surveyed extensively for the Argentine ant along the Gulf Coast, particularly in Louisiana.|$|R
50|$|Honey bees {{may become}} {{infected}} with a bacterial disease called <b>foul</b> <b>brood,</b> which attacks the developing bee larva while {{still living in}} the cell. Some hives however have evolved a behavioral adaptation that resists this disease: the worker bees selectively kill the infected individuals by removing them from their cells and tossing them out of the hive, preventing it from spreading. The genetics of this behavior are quite complex. Experiments by Rothenbuhler showed that the 'hygienic' behavior of the queen was lost by crossing with a non-hygienic drone. This means that the trait must be recessive, only being expressed when both alleles contain the gene for hygienic behavior. Furthermore, the behavior is dependent on two separate loci. A backcross produced a mixed result. The hives of some offspring were hygienic, while others were not. There was also a third type of hive where workers removed the wax cap of the infected cells, but did nothing more. What was not apparent was the presence of a fourth group who threw diseased larvae out of the hive, but did not have the uncapping gene. This was suspected by Rothenbuhler however, who manually removed the caps, and found some hives proceeded to clear out infected cells.|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time, growth of Mytilopsis leucophaeata, an {{important}} <b>European</b> <b>fouling</b> species, was investigated. By means of growth cages, individual shell growth of three cohorts, with, respectively, initial shell lengths of 5 mm, 10 mm and 15 mm, was monitored in the harbour of Antwerp, Belgium, during 2003 – 2004. M. leucophaeata followed an oscillatory growth pattern {{with a single}} summer growing period per year (May to August). Growth decreased during wintertime, but never ceased completely. M. leucophaeata has an average growth rate of 53 – 6 mm year 71. Temperature {{was found to be}} the main environmental factor affecting growth. The von Bertalanffy growth function was used to model growth of individuals 5 mm, resulting in L? 16. 7 mm and K 0. 56. Based on a combination of growth of all three cohorts, the hypothetical growth of an average individual mussel could be modelled over a 5 -year period, resulting in a maximum length 419 mm with a growth rate of 0. 41. Its longevity (more than 5 years) and the positive effect of higher water temperatures on growth, combined with its high resistance to chlorination, provides M. leucophaeata with a high potential for severe and long-lasting biofoulin...|$|R
