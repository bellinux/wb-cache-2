40|$|Imbalance in torque {{generation}} {{leads to}} engine speed fluctuation. To improve the <b>idle</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> performance, the torque balancing control problem is {{addressed in this}} paper for multi-cylinder SI engines. To evaluate cylinder-to-cylinder imbalance, the average torque in ignition-event scale is introduced as controlled output, which enables a feedback control to be performed without measurement of instantaneous torque, and the individual spark advances are chosen as control inputs. A linear discrete time model with single input and single output is proposed to represent {{the dynamics of the}} imbalance, where a sequentially switching function is introduced to describe the spark advance signals delivered to each cylinder and the differences in torque generation caused by the individual cylinder characteristics are equivalently modelled as unknown offset in the inputs. An estimation algorithm with the proof of convergence is presented to provide on-line estimation of the unknown offset under the passivity assumption of the system. Furthermore, a feedback control law which combines the unknown offset estimation and the model predictive control is proposed. Finally, the unknown offset estimation and the feedback control approach are validated based on the experimental results carried out on a six-cylinder gasoline engine test bench.

Natural gas is not renewable {{but it is the}} most abundant and has the lowest Lifecycle CO 2 emission among fossil fuel. Realizing such promising alternative, many logistics and transportation companies are converting their existing diesel-fueled vehicle to CNG-fueled. Researchers have shown that CNG engines offer advantages compared to diesel and gasoline engines such as high efficiency and low emissions. Prior to this work, a 4. 3 L 4 - cylinder diesel engine was modified and retrofitted with a CNG mono gas system. However, it was observed that the engine, CNG-fueled combustion is not stable especially at idling speed. The {{purpose of this study is}} to optimize the ignition timing best suited for idling both in normal operating mode (700 - 850 rpm) and in cold start mode (1000 - 2000 rpm). The ignition timings tested were 20 oBTDC and 25 oBTDC. The measurements were made at <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> from 700 to 2500 rpm.

40|$|This conference {{paper was}} {{published}} in the Proceedings of the 9 th International Styrian Noise, Vibration & Harshness Congress: The European Automotive Noise Conference, Graz, Austria, 22 - 24 June, 7 pp. [¬© SAE International]Legislation on vehicle emissions and the requirements for fuel efficiency are currently the key development driving factors in the automotive industry. Research activities to comply with these targets point to engine downsizing and new boosting technologies, which have adverse effects on the NVH performance, durability and component life. As a consequence of engine downsizing, substantial torsional oscillations are generated due to high combustion pressures. Meanwhile, to attenuate torsional vibrations, the manufacturers have implemented absorbers that are tuned to certain frequency ranges, including clutch dampers, Dual Mass Flywheel (DMF) and centrifugal pendulum dampers. These devices add mass/inertia to the system, potentially introducing negative effects on other vehicle attributes, such as weight, driving performance and gear shiftability. This paper provides a study of torsional damping effects of nonlinear vibration absorbers on drivetrain NVH refinement by attenuating torsional oscillations at the <b>idling</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> The nonlinear absorber concept presented operates on the principle of Targeted Energy Transfer (TET), whereby the energy excess (vibration) from a donor (primary powertrain system) is transferred to a receiver (nonlinear absorber) in a nearly irreversible manner. Thereafter, the received energy can be absorbed, dissipated, or redistributed. This potentially allows the absorber to operate over a broadband frequency range, whilst being light and compact, which is ideal for automotive powertrains. In the present work, simulations are performed using an automotive drivetrain (subsystem) model with a nonlinear absorber. The damping content of the absorber is varied to study its effect on the attenuation of torsional oscillations...|$|R

A nationwide survey of long-haul truck drivers was conducted to characterize truck operations and driver behavior better.

Approximately 10 % of drivers reported idling 10 % or less of engine run time, while another 100;" reported idling more than 54 % of engine run time, with differences related to season, truck ownership, company idling strategies, and driver experience. The mean annual fuel used during idle was estimated to be 1, 600 gal per year, but the standard deviation was 1, 300. An estimated 25 % of drivers consumed more than 2, 300 gal of fuel during idle (worth more than $ 3, 000 per year in U. S. dollars), and 10 % of drivers consumed more than 3, 400 gal per year.
