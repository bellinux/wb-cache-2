"If you {{had done}} {{anything}} of the sort, my love (excuse me, if I speak plainly), I should have said, 'Stella, your liver is out of order'; and I should have opened the <b>family</b> <b>medicine-chest.</b> I will only say now send for the carriage; let us go to a morning concert, dine at a restaurant, and finish the evening at the play." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I shall {{miss him}} of course, {{but it will}} be a relief to me and better for him; {{dangling}} is so bad for a boy. Now he will go into business with his father and do well, and everyone be happy. I shall give Dora an elegant <b>family</b> <b>medicine-chest</b> for a wedding-present, and teach her how to use it. Tom can't be trusted, and is no more fit for the profession than Silas.' ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{in those}} days the union doctor was not an institution. Large tracts of country would {{contract}} with some apothecary to attend their sick; but he was generally a busy man, with his hands full of paying patients, and there was nobody to keep him up to his work among the poor, {{if he could have}} done it, which he really could not. The poor themselves knew that it was in vain to apply to him, or if he came once in a serious case, to expect any attention; and they preferred to depend on the woman clever in [...] "yarbs," [...] on the white witch, or, in favoured villages, on the lady bountiful or the clergyman and his wife; and in simple cases these latter were quite efficient, keeping a <b>family</b> <b>medicine-chest</b> and a book on household medicine.|$|E
60|$|I saw the HAWBUCK scene {{out of the}} Study, which {{commands}} the garden. It's a curious object, that Study. Ponto's library mostly consists of boots. He and Stripes have important interviews here of mornings, when the potatoes are discussed, or {{the fate of the}} calf ordained, or sentence passed on the pig, &c.. All the Major's bills are docketed on the Study table and displayed like a lawyer's briefs. Here, too, lie displayed his hooks, knives, and other gardening irons, his whistles, and strings of spare buttons. He has a drawer of endless brown paper for parcels, and another containing a prodigious and never-failing supply of string. What a man can want with so many gig-whips I can never conceive. These, and fishing-rods, and landing-nets, and spurs, and boot-trees, and balls for horses, and surgical implements for the same, and favourite pots of shiny blacking, with which he paints his own shoes in the most elegant manner, and buckskin gloves stretched out on their trees, and his gorget, sash, and sabre of the Horse Marines, with his boot-hooks underneath in atrophy; and the <b>family</b> <b>medicine-chest,</b> and in a corner the very rod with which he used to whip his son, Wellesley Ponto, when a boy (Wellesley never entered the 'Study' but for that awful purpose)--all these, with 'Mogg's Road Book,' the GARDENERS' CHRONICLE, and a backgammon-board, form the Major's library. Under the trophy there's a picture of Mrs. Ponto, in a light blue dress and train, and no waist, when she was first married; a fox's brush lies over the frame, and serves to keep the dust off that work of art.|$|E
