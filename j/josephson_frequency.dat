We {{find that the}} <b>Josephson</b> <b>frequency</b> is virtually independent {{of the number of}} atoms in the BEC and of the inter-atomic interaction (attractive or repulsive). We study the dependence of <b>Josephson</b> <b>frequency</b> on the laser wave length and the strength of the optical-lattice potential. For a fixed laser wave length (795 nm), the <b>Josephson</b> <b>frequency</b> decreases with increasing strength as found in the experiment of Cataliotti et al. [Science 293, 843 (2001) ]. For a fixed strength, the <b>Josephson</b> <b>frequency</b> remains essentially unchanged for a reasonable variation of laser wave length around 800 nm. However, for a fixed strength, the Josephson oscillation is disrupted with the increase of laser wave length beyond 2000 nm leading to a collapse of a sufficiently attractive BEC. These features of Josephson oscillation can be tested experimentally with present set ups. Comment: 7 pages, 12 ps and eps figures, Physical Review...|$|E

Typeset using REVTEX 1 In the Josephson effect [1], the quantum mechanical phases of two superconductors are coupled by the tunneling of the Cooper pairs between them. The coupling energy {{is a measure of}} the phase coherence, and the lowest energy is achieved when the phase difference is zero. However, if a phase difference is imposed and the system is released, the phase, to a good approximation, oscillates harmonically. Because the time derivative of the phase is proportional to the voltage difference between the superconductors by the Josephson relation, the voltage also oscillates harmonically, and the frequency of the oscillation is called the <b>Josephson</b> plasma <b>frequency,</b> ωJ [2].

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{electromagnetic radiation}} emitted {{by a small}} voltage-biased Josephson junction connected to a superconducting transmission line. At frequencies below the well known emission peak at the <b>Josephson</b> <b>frequency</b> (2 eV/h), extra radiation is triggered by quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic environment. For weak tunneling couplings and typical ohmic transmission lines, the corresponding photon flux spectrum is symmetric around half the <b>Josephson</b> <b>frequency,</b> indicating that the photons are predominately created in pairs. By establishing an input-output formalism for the microwave field in the transmission line, we give further evidence for this nonclassical photon pair production, demonstrating that it violates the classical Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for two-mode flux cross correlations.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{study the}} transition radiation of bulk and surface electromagnetic waves by an electron crossing an interface between a layered superconductor and an isotropic dielectric. We {{assume that the}} direction of the electron motion and the orientation of the superconducting layers are perpendicular to the interface. We derive the analytical expressions for the strongly anisotropic radiation fields and for the time-integrated energy fluxes of bulk and oblique surface electromagnetic waves (OSWs). We show that the OSWs with frequencies close to the <b>Josephson</b> plasma <b>frequency</b> ω_J provide the main contribution to the OSWs energy flux. Moreover, for frequencies close to the <b>Josephson</b> plasma <b>frequency,</b> the spectral density of the OSWs radiation diverges at some critical value of the azimuth angle φ. At the angles φ= 0 and φ= 90 ^o, the radiation field has a transverse magnetic polarization. We have also studied the Cherenkov radiation by the electron escaping from the layered superconductor and show that this radiation is almost monochromatic.

40|$|Abstract. We {{found that}} {{stability}} of moving lattice of Josephson vortices {{driven by the}} transport cur-rent {{is limited by the}} critical velocity which agrees with the maximum velocity observed in BSCCO in the flux-flow regime. We also predict a peak of the radiation at <b>Josephson</b> plasma <b>frequency</b> which may be observed in high magnetic field. The flux-flow regime of Josephson vortex lattice induced by a magnetic field parallel to the conducting layers and driven by a transport current flowing in the direction perpendicular to the layers was observed in BSCCO mesa structures [1, 2]. The Josephson vortices are coreless, so their motion a t low temperatures corresponds to underdamped regime. When the velocity of the lattice is high enough the flux-flow is expected to interact with Josephson plasma oscillations [3] giving rise to resonance features on I-V curves [4] around voltages related to the <b>Josephson</b> plasma <b>frequency</b> W,. However, such features were not observed. The experimental I-V curves in the flux-flow regime were found to be limited by a maximum voltage, and, hence, by maximum lattice velocity. Above this voltage either a different regime was observed [l] or no stable I-V curves were found in a close range of currents and voltages [2]. In addition, a broadband emission in the microwave region was observed [l] which was associated with a Cherenkov radiation...|$|R
40|$|We study {{microwave}} radiation emitted {{by a small}} voltage-biased Josephson junction connected to a superconducting transmission line. An input-output formalism for the radiation field is established, using a perturbation expansion in the junction's critical current. Using output field operators solved {{up to the second}} order, we estimate the spectral density and the second-order coherence of the emitted field. For typical transmission line impedances and at frequencies below the main emission peak at the <b>Josephson</b> <b>frequency,</b> radiation occurs predominantly due to two-photon emission. This emission is characterized by a high degree of photon bunching if detected symmetrically around half of the <b>Josephson</b> <b>frequency.</b> Strong phase fluctuations in the transmission line make related nonclassical phase-dependent amplitude correlations short lived, and there is no steady-state two-mode squeezing. However, the radiation is shown to violate the classical Cauchy-Schwarz inequality of intensity cross-correlations, demonstrating the nonclassicality of the photon pair production in this region.
