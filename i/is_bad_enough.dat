25|$|A soldier whose {{business}} is murder {{as a fine}} art, a diplomat whose calling is based on deception and secretiveness, a politician whose very life consists in compromises with his conscience, a business man whose aim is personal profit within the limits allowed by a lenient law—such may be excused if they set patriotic deception above common everyday decency and perform services as spies. They merely accept the code of morality to which modern society still conforms. Not so the scientist. The very essence of his life is the service of truth. We all know scientists who in private life do not {{come up to the}} standard of truthfulness, but who, nevertheless, would not consciously falsify the results of their researches. It <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> if we {{have to put up with}} these, because they reveal a lack of strength of character that is liable to distort the results of their work. A person, however, who uses science as a cover for political spying, who demeans himself to pose before a foreign government as an investigator and asks for assistance in his alleged researches in order to carry on, under this cloak, his political machinations, prostitutes science in an unpardonable way and forfeits the right to be classed as a scientist.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} a mixed critical response. In a review for Time magazine entitled [...] "Just Another Mississippi Whitewash", author Jack E. White described {{the film as}} a [...] "cinematic lynching of the truth". He wrote, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> that most Americans know next to nothing about {{the true story of}} the civil rights movement. It would be even worse for them to embrace the fabrications in Mississippi Burning." [...] Columnist Desson Howe of The Washington Post believed that the film [...] "speeds down the complicated, painful path of civil rights in search of a good thriller. Surprisingly, it finds it". He felt the film was a [...] "Hollywood-movie triumph that blacks could have used more of during – and since – that era." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader, lightly criticized Parker's direction, commenting that the film was [...] "sordid fantasy" [...] being [...] "trained on the murder of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964, and the feast for the self-righteous that emerges {{has little to do with}} history, sociology, or even common sense." [...] Rita Kempley of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "...like the South African saga Cry Freedom, it views the black struggle from an all-white perspective. And there's something of the demon itself in that. It's the right story, but with the wrong heroes." [...] Pauline Kael, writing for The New Yorker, praised the acting, but criticized the film's [...] "garish forms of violence" [...] and described it as [...] "morally repugnant".|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} Peeta Mellark from [...] "The Hunger Games" [...] {{loses his}} left leg {{at the end of}} the novel, after surviving a bad wound and blood poisoning. However, when he is attacked by one of the Mutts, the wound <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> that it later causes the leg to be amputated by the capitol. He is given a replacement prosthetic leg.|$|E
60|$|ATTEN. Alas! poor wretch, he <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> before, but these, I suppose, {{made him}} much worse.|$|R
60|$|That <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough,</b> and Ellen wept bitterly again; {{while her}} mother and Harold both cried out with surprise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, Esmeralda, {{there is}} nothing. Go back to sleep. You <b>are</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> asleep, {{but you are}} {{infinitely}} worse awake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't talk {{of those}} horrors before my daughter. It <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> {{to have to}} do such things, without {{speaking}} about them afterwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{not be so}} boisterous, Duke," [...] said Marian. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> {{to have to face}} an {{audience}} without being ridiculed beforehand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God forbid!" [...] ejaculated the merchant. [...] "That sort {{of thing}} <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> out of doors, but worst of all in your own house." ...|$|E
6000|$|Again Ralph's eyes flashed. It <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to have insults heaped {{upon his}} own head, {{but when they}} touched his mother---- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Always a bore, children. At dessert, they <b>are</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough,</b> but {{at dinner}} they're the deuce and all," [...] remarked Mr. Brummell.|$|R
60|$|Leo, Anders, and timid little Oblooria, however, {{were not}} lost! Their case <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough,</b> {{but it had}} not quite come to that.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No wonder,' Lord Ulleswater said; 'it <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> {{coming down}} the hill by oneself, but {{carrying}} a lady, {{it must have been}} hard work indeed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{like this}} way of working. The lower level <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> without thinkin' {{all the time that}} {{somebody}} is tryin' to do a fellow up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'In short,' {{concluded}} James, walking {{about the}} room, 'there is no alternative. Waiting for a College living <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough,</b> {{but nothing else}} can make happiness even possible.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "D---- her! d---- her!" [...] exclaimed the other, gnashing {{his teeth}} with {{concentrated}} wrath. [...] "No punishment will <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> for her. Hanging would not <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not {{one common}} word of explanation?' he implored. 'Don't think I <b>am</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> {{to try to}} lead you astray. Well, go--it is better.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those ones <b>are</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough,</b> though," [...] {{declared}} Cap'n Bill. [...] "If {{you know}} any worse ones, I don't want a interduction to 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I dare say. He <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> {{even for}} that. But as I am quite {{convinced}} that {{it will never be}} allowed, his intentions do not trouble me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Off! {{to be sure}} I did--do {{you think}} I wanted a barber's clerk for a son-in-law? No, no, Denbigh; a soldier <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough,</b> without having a preacher." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes! And {{throw the}} whole day after the half, and lose my rehearsal. It <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to lose my temper. I swore, I can tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, they <b>are</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough,</b> landlord; but I {{should say}} that you must be doing a good trade, with all these {{soldiers}} in the town." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{desertion}} itself <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> in all conscience; {{but it was}} {{as nothing}} at all in Granville's mind to the wickedness of the robbery.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was sent}} with some {{important}} papers, which I lost. This <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough,</b> but there <b>was</b> some ground for suspecting that I had stolen them." ...|$|R
60|$|No {{one should}} have any {{correspondence}} on a journey; it <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to have to write, but the receipt of letters is the death of all holiday feeling.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad of it," [...] {{returned}} his older brother. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> for Crabtree to get away. I hope they keep a strict guard over the others after this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I can," [...] {{answered}} Tom. [...] "Baxter <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough,</b> but he didn't {{go in for}} poisoning us. I am glad to know he isn't {{quite so}} heartless as that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> {{while it}} <b>was</b> daylight, Fred. I really don't {{know what we}} are going to do now it's dark," [...] {{answered}} Jack, seriously.|$|R
60|$|I don't know, that's {{just the}} awful part of it. It <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> before. I knew the worst Cohen could do, but now.... It couldn't be Paradine.|$|R
60|$|To {{be thrown}} down so violently <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough,</b> but to <b>be</b> spiked {{in the leg}} hurt so much that Jack could not repress a gasp of pain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, madam," [...] {{answered}} the Knight, [...] "my neighbour <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough,</b> {{but not so}} bad as you would make him; he is but a Presbyterian--that I must confess--but not an Independent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] she cried, [...] "I am a most wicked woman. But it <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> {{that one}} should misuse you. Ma foi! I will {{see that there is}} not a second one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is right," [...] said Ermine; [...] "I am {{thankful that}} {{he is out of}} reach of trying to take a share in the nursing, it <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to have one in the midst!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Training race-horses!" [...] said Soames. It <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough,</b> but not {{the reason}} for his distaste. Why the deuce couldn't his nephew have stayed out in South Africa? His own divorce had <b>been</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough,</b> without his nephew's {{marriage}} to the daughter of the co-respondent; a half-sister too of June, and of that boy whom Fleur had just been looking at from under the pump-handle. If he didn't look out, Fleur would come to know all about that old disgrace! Unpleasant things! They were round him this afternoon like a swarm of bees! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>were</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> before," [...] {{said the}} Magician, resentfully; [...] "but a live {{phonograph}} {{is enough to}} drive every sane person in the Land of Oz stark crazy." ...|$|R
60|$|Tarzan was appalled. It had <b>been</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to <b>be</b> hairless, but to own such a countenance! He {{wondered}} {{that the}} other apes could look at him at all.|$|R
