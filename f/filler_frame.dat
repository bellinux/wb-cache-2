40|$|The mfERG {{provides}} a topographic map of {{function of the}} retina and {{has been used in}} numerous studies to identify macular, paramacular and peripheral retinal dysfunction. This study investigates the changes in response due to the presentation rate of the stimulus. Twenty subjects gave informed consent {{to take part in the}} study, which had local regional ethical committee approval. Only a single hexagon of 8 � diameter was presented to reduce ambiguity when identifying the higher-order kernels (HOK). Six rates were tested using a 60 -Hz CRT monitor by introducing blank (black * 0 cd/m 2) <b>filler</b> <b>frames</b> (FF). The rates tested were 0 FF; 1 FF; 2 FF; 4 FF; 7 FF; and 14 FF. The first-order kernel had largest responses to the slower stimuli (4 FF and above). HOK had largest amplitudes at faster rates with the second-order kernel peaking at 1 FF. At rates with 4 FF and slower, the higher-order kernels were indiscernible above the noise...|$|R

Until his move to Germany in May 1913, Hitler supplied Altenberg's stores {{on a regular basis}} with his own paintings, mostly watercolours, which Altenberg used as <b>filler</b> for the <b>frames</b> on display. The relationship between Hitler and Altenberg was good regardless of Altenberg's Jewish ancestry, and Altenberg is reported to have said that he never heard Hitler utter an anti-Semetic remark.|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} several methods on the Interspeech 2013 Paralinguistic Challenge- Social Signals Sub-Challenge dataset. The task of this sub-challenge is to detect laughter and <b>fillers</b> per <b>frame.</b> We apply Random Forests with varying number {{of trees and}} randomly selected features. We then proceed with minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) ranking of features. We employ SVM with linear kernel to form a relative baseline for comparability to baseline provided in the challenge paper. The results indicate the relative superiority of Random Forests to SVMs in terms of sub-challenge performance measure, namely UAAUC. We also observe that using mRMR based feature selection, {{it is possible to}} reduce the number of features to half with negligible loss of performance. Furthermore, the performance loss due to feature reduction is found to be less in Random Forests compared to SVMs. We also make use of neighboring frames to smooth the posteriors. On the overall, we attain an increase of 5. 1 % (absolute) in UAAUC in challenge test set...|$|R
50|$|Modes 3 and 6 {{were special}} {{software}} (framebuffer) text modes. To save RAM, {{the count of}} lines was reduced from 32 to 25. As this would reduce {{the height of the}} <b>frame,</b> <b>filler</b> rows were created between each line of text when the frame was output, where no pixels were read from the framebuffer. This creates characteristic black lines between the rows of text when a different background colour is set, and a blank gap {{at the bottom of the}} display with the left-over pixels. The screen mode is otherwise held in memory as a regular graphics mode.|$|R
40|$|Multimodal grammars {{provide an}} {{expressive}} formalism for multimodal integration and understanding. However, handcrafted multimodal grammars can be brittle {{with respect to}} unexpected, erroneous, or disfluent inputs. Spoken language (speech-only) understanding systems have addressed this issue of lack of robustness of hand-crafted grammars by exploiting classification techniques to extract <b>fillers</b> of a <b>frame</b> representation. In this paper, we illustrate the limitations of such classification approaches for multimodal integration and understanding and present an approach based on edit machines that combine the expressiveness of multimodal grammars with the robustness of stochastic language models of speech recognition. We also present an approach where the edit operations are trained from data using a noisy channel model paradigm. We evaluate and compare {{the performance of the}} hand-crafted and learned edit machines {{in the context of a}} multimodal conversational system (MATCH). ...|$|R
40|$|To {{answer the}} {{critical}} need for sharable, reusable annotated resources with rich linguistic annotations, we {{are developing a}} Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) including texts from diverse genres and manual annotations or manually-validated annotations for multiple levels, including WordNet senses and FrameNet frames and frame elements, {{both of which have}} become significant resources in the international computational linguistics community. To derive maximal benefit from the semantic information provided by these resources, the MASC will also include manually-validated shallow parses and named entities, which will enable linking WordNet senses and FrameNet frames within the same sentences into more complex semantic structures and, because named entities will often be the role <b>fillers</b> of FrameNet <b>frames,</b> enrich the semantic and pragmatic information derivable from the sub-corpus. All MASC annotations will be published with detailed inter-annotator agreement measures. The MASC and its annotations will be freely downloadable from the ANC website, thus providing maximum accessibility for researchers from around the globe. 1.

V nadaljevanju smo za praktičen primer izdelali tehnološki elaborat izvedbe s preračunom globalne stabilnosti za posamezno fazo gradnje. Posebno poglavje smo namenili izvedbi opornega zidu OZ 12, ki je ob AC Draženci – MMP Gruškovje. Dolžina zidu znaša 115, 196 m in je do višine 6, 0 m zasnovan kot kamnita zložba, pri večjih višinah (od 6 do 8 m) pa je zasnovan kot branasta konstrukcija z vmesnimi kamnitimi polnili. Branasto konstrukcijo sestavljajo sidrani vertikalni slopi in horizontalne grede. Naklon branaste konstrukcije znaša 3 : 1, s čimer je zagotovljen enotni čelni naklon na celotni oporni konstrukciji. V zaključku smo povzeli skladnost predhodno izdelanega tehnološkega elaborata z dejansko izvedbo opornega zidu na terenu. The {{first part}} of the master 2 ̆ 7 s thesis {{describes}} the basic division of retaining and supporting structures, their purpose and execution. We have also presented various anchoring systems of supporting and retaining structures. Furthermore, we have created a practical example of the implementation of technological study with the adjustment of global stability for each phase of construction. A special chapter was devoted to the implementation of the retaining wall OZ 12, which is located at the AC Draženci ‒ MMP Gruškovje. The length of the wall is 115. 196 m and up to a height of 6. 0 m is designed as a rocky wall or stone wall, at higher altitudes (from 6. 0 to 8. 3 m) is designed as a anchored frame structure with intermediate stone <b>fillers.</b> Anchored <b>frame</b> structure consists of anchored vertical columns and horizontal beams. Inclination of harrow structure is 3 : 1, thereby to provide a single front slope of the entire supporting structure. In conclusion, we summarized the compliance of pre-made technological study with the actual implementation of the retaining wall on the ground...|$|R
40|$|The European Union {{is working}} on {{strategies}} {{in order to increase}} the energy efficiency of buildings. A useful solution is to identify the energy performance of buildings through the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC), as it provides information for the comparison of buildings with different architectural typology, shape, design technology and geographic location. However, this tool does not assess the real energy consumption of the building and does not always take into account its impact on the environment. In this work, two different types of analysis were carried out: one based only on the energy efficiency and the other one based on the environmental impact. Those analyses were applied on a standard building, set in three different Italian locations, with the purpose of obtaining cross-related information. After the evaluation of the results, interventions on some parameters (walls insulation, windows <b>frame,</b> <b>filler</b> gas in the insulated glazing) have been identified in order to improve the energy behavior of the building with an acceptable environmental impact. The aim {{of this paper is to}} propose a methodology that integrates the EPC with green building rating systems, leading to a more conscious choice of retrofit interventions as a compromise between energy performances and environmental impact...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: According to the dual-route model, {{a printed}} string of letters can be {{processed}} through either a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion route or a lexical-semantic route. While meta-analyses of the imaging literature (Cattinelli, Borghese, Gallucci, & Paulesu, 2013; Taylor, Rastle, & Davis, 2012) have supported distinct and interacting procedures, individual neuroimaging studies exploring such neural correlates {{by means of}} reading, phonological and semantic tasks yielded results that remain not conclusive. Aims: To investigate the neural correlates of the lexical and sublexical reading procedures, we used a frame-manipulation paradigm whereby subjects read disyllabic Italian words embedded in lists of either irregular words, inducing lexical processing of the target words, or pseudowords, inducing sublexical reading processing of the target words. Possible linguistic confounders as word frequency, phonological complexity, orthographic neighborhood size and imageability were thus perfectly controlled. Methods: Thirty-three university subjects participated in the behavioral study and 22 {{were included in the}} fMRI study. Two reading tasks were created: in a first task, disyllabic word targets were embedded in <b>filler</b> lists (<b>frames)</b> formed of either loanwords or pseudowords, while, in the second task, disyllabic word targets were embedded in filler lists made of either trisyllabic words or pseudowords with a consonant-vowel structure. Moreover, at behavioral level, all subjects read a list of disyllabic target words (block condition). From fMRI data, we extracted: a) the lexical effect, computed as the activation pattern in the loanword frame and in the trisyllabic-word frame, while excluding areas showing the weakest trend for activation in the sublexical condition; b) the sublexical effect, computed as the activation pattern in the pseudoword frame, once weakest trend for activation in the lexical frame was excluded. It is worth emphasizing that the BOLD signal analyzed was always for reading real disyllabic words dispersed (40 %) in the two different frames. Results and discussion: A significant main effect of the list condition emerged from behavioral data: participants were faster when reading disyllabic words embedded in a lexical frame than when reading targets embedded in a sublexical frame. Moreover, participants were faster when reading targets in a block condition than in either the lexical or the sublexical frame. Anatomofunctional results (Figure 1) showed that the left occipital, the anterior and posterior temporal regions, and the left intraparietal sulcus were specifically activated when reading targets in a lexical frame. The left posterior inferior temporal and inferior parietal regions were activated in sublexical condition. Finally, reading along the two routes commonly activated the Visual Word Form Area, the premotor cortex, the left frontal areas and the left SMA, suggesting an involvement of these regions in early-input (early orthographic processing) and late-output processes (phonological output buffer and articulatory programming). Conclusions: These results represent a new fine-grained description of the neurofunctional correlates of the dual route model partially supporting the recent anatomical investigations in patients with specific forms of acquired dyslexia (Ripamonti, Aggujaro, Molteni, Zonca, Ghirardi, & Luzzatti, 2014) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: According to {{the dual}} route model, a visual string of graphemes can be {{processed}} through either the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (GPC) or the lexical routes (Coltheart, Patterson, & Marshall, 1980; Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001). Several neuroimaging studies (see Cattinelli, Borghese, Gallucci, & Paulesu, 2013; Taylor, Rastle, & Davis, 2012 for a review) explored the neural correlates {{of these two}} procedures by means of reading, phonological and semantic tasks, but, notwithstanding {{the large amount of}} fMRI evidence available, there is no complete consensus about the role that some specific cerebral areas, as the left occipito-temporal cortex, hold during the reading process. Aims: To isolate specific areas underlying the two reading procedures, we used a frame-manipulation paradigm whereby subjects read bi-syllabic Italian –needless to say- regular words preceded or followed by English loan words or tri-syllabic CVCVCV words (lexical condition) or by non-words (sub-lexical condition). By doing so, we generated two reading frames biased towards a lexical rather than a sub-lexical (GPC) reading strategy. Possible linguistic confounders as word frequency, orthographic neighborhood size, imageability and length of stimuli were all controlled for. Methods: Thirty-three university subjects participated in the behavioral study and 22 were included in the fMRI study. Each subject underwent two reading tasks: in a first task, disyllabic word targets were embedded in <b>filler</b> lists (<b>frames)</b> formed of either loanwords or pseudowords containing consonant clusters, while, in the second task, disyllabic word targets were embedded in filler lists made of either trisyllabic words or pseudowords with a consonant-vowel (CV) structure. From data analyses, we extracted: a) the lexical effect, computed as the activation pattern in the loanword frame and in the CV-trisyllabic-word frame, while excluding areas showing the weakest trend for activation in the GPC condition; b) the GPC effect, computed as the activation pattern in the pseudoword frame, once weakest trend for activation in the lexical frame was excluded. It is worth emphasizing that the BOLD signal analyzed was ALWAYS for reading real bi-syllabic words dispersed in the two different frames. Results and discussion: These results represent a new fine-grained description of the neurofunctional correlates of the dual route model. In particular, the left occipital (BA 18 / 19), the anterior and posterior temporal regions, and the left intraparietal sulcus were specifically activated when reading targets in a lexical frame. The left posterior inferior temporal and inferior parietal regions were activated in GPC condition. Finally, the two routes commonly activated the Visual Word Form Area, the premotor cortex, the left frontal areas and the left SMA suggesting an involvement of these regions in input and output early processes. Furthermore, our data confirm the hypothesis that different portions of the left occipito-temporal area have different functional roles in reading. In line with the neurofunctional model proposed by Danelli et al. (2013) : the posterior part was activated by the lexical route, the anterior part was activated by the sublexical route, while the ventral portion, corresponding to the so-called Visual Word Form Area (Cohen et al., 2002), was commonly activated by the two routes.
