40|$|For {{the first}} time, DNA and {{chitosan}} are employed using the Layer by Layer technique {{in order to}} build green coatings exhibiting efficient flame retardant properties. DNA by its chemical structure can be considered as an intrinsically intumescent compound, since it contains precursor of phosphoricpolyphosphoric acid, a polyhydric char source (deoxyribose) and the nitrogen-containing bases that may release ammonia, acting as a blowing agent. When combined with chitosan, DNA layers promote the char formation of the former, by releasing phosphoric and polyphosphoric acid. Such bioarchitectures show an exponential growth as assessed by infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Very interestingly, these LbL assemblies are capable of i) reaching the selfextinguishment of cotton during <b>horizontal</b> <b>flammability</b> tests, ii) increasing the limit oxygen index up to 24 % and iii) reducing the heat release rate by 40 % during cone calorimetry test...|$|E
40|$|Flame retardancy was {{imparted}} in cellulosic {{cotton textile}} using banana pseudostem sap (BPS), an eco-friendly natural product. The extracted sap was made alkaline and applied in pre-mordanted bleached and mercerized cotton fabrics. Flame retardant properties {{of both the}} control and the treated fabrics were analysed in terms of limiting oxygen index (LOI), horizontal and vertical flammability. Fabrics treated with the non-diluted BPS {{were found to have}} good flame retardant property with LOI of 30 compared to the control fabric with LOI of 18, i. e., an increase of 1. 6 times. In the vertical flammability test, the BPS treated fabric showed flame for a few seconds and then, got extinguished. In the <b>horizontal</b> <b>flammability</b> test, the treated fabric showed no flame, but was burning only with an afterglow with a propagation rate of 7. 5 mm/min, which was almost 10 times lower than that noted with the control fabric. The thermal degradation and the pyrolysis of the fabric samples were studied using a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the chemical composition by FTIR, SEM and EDX, besides the pure BPS being characterized by EDX and mass spectroscopy. The fabric after the treatment was found to produce stable natural khaki colour, and there was no significant degradation in mechanical strengths. Based on the results, the mechanism of imparting flame retardancy to cellulosic textile and the formation of natural colour on it using the proposed BPS treatment have been postulated...|$|E
