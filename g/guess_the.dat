5|$|Beta-2 had two builds (beta-2a: 28 February 1996 and beta-2b: 21 March 1996) and {{introduced}} a new API for communicating with other applications. Also, the internal component libwww was updated to version 4. OMRON Corporation developed an internationalized version that could display Chinese, Korean and Japanese characters in one page. OMRON's Arena supports both ISO-2022 and Unicode. It is able to <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> charset parameter automatically if charset parameter isn't specified in Content-Type field.|$|E
5|$|Flanagan {{observes that}} in Tenebrae, Argento offers two {{characters}} {{who suffer from}} impaired vision. Gianni (Christian Borromeo) is an eyewitness to an axe-murder, but the trauma of seeing the killing causes him to disregard a vital clue. Returning {{to the scene of}} the crime, he suddenly remembers everything, and is murdered before being able to tell anyone. Homicide detective Giermani reveals that he is a big fan of the novels of Agatha Christie, Mickey Spillane, Rex Stout, and Ed McBain, but admits that he has never been able to <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> identity of the killer in any of the books. He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet – he cannot see Peter Neal for what he really is.|$|E

50|$|The {{possession}} of the respective accumulated money by either team was decided. <b>The</b> team captains <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> how many arrows their teammates could fire into a sand sack; <b>the</b> captain who <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> closest would take the larger lot of money regardless of the initial team who collected it.|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> {{contestant}} correctly <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> word, he/she won $100. An incorrect response {{allowed the}} opposing team to <b>guess,</b> with <b>the</b> advantage of having heard the entire description. <b>The</b> team that <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> word was then {{given a chance to}} solve the puzzle by filling in all four blanks; successfully doing so scored one point. If neither team guessed a word, it was put up on the board and play continued with the next word. Teams alternated describing the four words in the puzzle. Saying the word or any form of it in the description immediately awarded $100 and a free <b>guess</b> at <b>the</b> puzzle to {{the opposing team}}. If both teams missed the fourth word, Goen read a definition of it as a toss-up, and the first team to buzz in with the answer received the $100 and a <b>guess</b> at <b>the</b> puzzle. If <b>the</b> team that <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> fourth word failed to solve the puzzle, their opponents were given a chance to solve it.|$|R
5|$|In 2000, Lone Hvass of the Elsinore Museum, Miranda Aldhouse-Green of Cardiff University, and the Department of Forensic Science at the University of Århus {{performed}} a re-examination of the Haraldskær Woman. Forensic analysis revealed stomach contents of unhusked millet and blackberries. Her neck had a faint groove {{as if someone}} applied a rope for torture or strangulation. The scientists concluded bog acids caused the swelling of the knee joint and that the woman was probably already dead before the branches pinned her down. Because of her careful placement, and since cremation was the prevailing mode of interment during that period in Jutland, the examiners <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> Haraldskær Woman {{was a victim of}} ritual sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Later medieval chroniclers, such as Roger of Wendover, {{gave some}} {{information}} about East Anglian events, but Yorke suggests that the annalistic format used forced these writers to <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> dates of the key events they recorded. Such later sources are therefore treated with caution. The Anglian collection, which dates from the late 8th century, contains an East Anglian genealogical tally, but Rædwald is not included. Rædwald is however {{referred to in the}} 8th century Vita of St Gregory the Great, written {{by a member of the}} religious community at Whitby. The Battle of the River Idle, in which Rædwald and his forces defeated the Northumbrians, is described in the 12th century Historia Anglorum, written by Henry of Huntingdon.|$|E

BNS calls search that tells whether the minmax in the subtree is smaller or bigger than <b>the</b> <b>guess.</b> it changes <b>the</b> <b>guessed</b> value until alpha and beta is close enough or only one subtree allows minimax value bigger than guessed value.|$|R

The WWE Game Show covers every wrestling topic imaginable including costumes, trends, music, finishers, styles, history, feuds, and more. Most questions include excerpts of songs and have players <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> tune or players are shown a video clip and must <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> match the clip is from. The questions range from easy to extremely difficult. Other minigames include a poker game and Eugene's airplane game in which the player navigates Eugene around the ring in the fastest time.|$|E

25|$|The first {{attack on}} the A5/1 was {{proposed}} by Ross Anderson in 1994. Anderson’s basic idea was to <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> complete content of the registers R1 and R2 and {{about half of the}} register R3. In this way the clocking of all three registers is determined and the second half of R3 can be computed.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Hour: A {{well-established}} feature, previously on Radio 1 from 1973 to 2001.

25|$|The {{relatively}} simple system of land distribution, {{made possible by}} applying {{the expression of the}} East India Company, allowed the landowners to dispose with legal measurement units: each owner could <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> extent of his property by looking at nature.

25|$|In 1986, a coin-operated arcade game {{based on}} the show was {{released}} by Bally Sente, created by Owen Rubin. The player's task was to <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> tune being played from among four choices. It also featured a two-player mode. While playable, some gamers consider the machine's difficulty to be high due to the technical limits of the very basic synthesized music the machine was capable of.|$|E
25|$|You can {{probably}} <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> physical interpretation {{in the case}} when the two fixed points are 0, ∞: an observer who is both rotating (with constant angular velocity) about some axis and moving along the same axis, will see {{the appearance of the}} night sky transform according to the one-parameter subgroup of loxodromic transformations with fixed points 0, ∞, and with ρ, α determined respectively by the magnitude of the actual linear and angular velocities.|$|E
