In September 1899 his History of Australia was published which was afterwards several times revised. The tenth edition, published in 1924, brought the number of copies issued up to 60,000. Jose then went to South Africa and for a short period was a war correspondent. Travelling then to London Jose published The Growth of the Empire (1901) and in 1902 was appointed professor of English and History at the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, Aligarh, India. Jose soon returned to London where he became interested in the Imperial Tariff and Tariff Reform League, did some writing for the press, and in 1903 was appointed The Times correspondent in Australia. He held this position from 1904 to 1915 and fearlessly endeavored to set out the Australian point of view.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{the implementation of a}} Linux <b>extension</b> <b>board</b> for the e-puck educational mobile robot, designed to enhance the computation, memory and networking performance of the robot at very low cost. The <b>extension</b> <b>board</b> is based on a 32 -bit ARM 9 microprocessor and provides wireless network support. The ARM 9 <b>extension</b> <b>board</b> runs in parallel with the dsPIC microprocessor on the e-puck motherboard with communication between the two via an SPI bus. The <b>extension</b> <b>board</b> is designed to handle computationally intensive image processing, wireless communication and high-level intelligent robot control algorithms, while the dsPIC handles low-level sensor interfacing, data processing and motor control. The <b>extension</b> <b>board</b> runs an embedded Linux operating system, along with a Debian-based port of the root file system stored in a Micro SD card. The extended e-puck robot platform requires minimal effort to integrate the well-known open-source robot control framework Player and, when placed within a TCP/IP networked infrastructure, provides a powerful and flexible platform for experimental swarm robotics research...|$|E
40|$|The MegaWatch project {{goal was}} to design and build a {{wireless}} network platform composed of 25 prototype hardware units to experiment with self-organized, infrastructureless ad-hoc networks. Requirements included reconfigurable, autonomous, low power consumption, and power measurement capability. In the long term, it is intended that all the above functionality be integrated in a small, watch size component. The design chosen was composed of five main blocks: two radio links, a power supply, <b>extension</b> <b>board,</b> and processing unit. An off-the-shelf, XE- 1202 digital radio circuit from Xemics was selected as one radio link for low-power, short distance communications. A commercial wireless LAN card, using the 802. 11 b standard protocol, provided a second independent monitoring radio link. The power supply chosen was composed of three voltage regulators, a battery overdischarge protection, and a power rectifier. The <b>extension</b> <b>board</b> supports both radio systems and contains a screen, keyboard, buttons and LEDs {{to interact with the}} user. Two microcontrollers within the processor and <b>extension</b> <b>board</b> contain an ADC converter used for power measurements.
