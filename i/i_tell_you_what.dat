500|$|Shortly before rehearsals {{began in}} January 1951, Rodgers {{had the first}} Tuptim, Doretta Morrow, sing the entire score to Lawrence, {{including}} Lawrence's own songs. [...] Lawrence listened calmly, but when she met Rodgers and Hammerstein the following day, she treated Rodgers coldly, apparently seeing the composer's actions as flaunting her vocal deficiencies. [...] Hammerstein and Rodgers' doubts about whether Lawrence could handle the part were assuaged by the sheer force of her acting. [...] James Poling, a writer for Collier's who was allowed to attend the rehearsals, wrote of Lawrence preparing [...] "Shall <b>I</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>You</b> <b>What</b> I Think of You?": ...|$|E
500|$|Australia {{finished}} the Games with two bronze medals. Jason Hellwig {{stated that the}} aim was to win between two and five medals. He said: [...] "wo medals absolutely is a pass ... so we're really pleased with that but we're absolutely disappointed we didn't get the mission done to win that gold medal, but <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what,</b> we are absolutely determined to get it done in four years' time. It hasn't been easy, we've come in under the most difficult of circumstances that I've ever seen a team [...] at a major Games." [...] Chris Nunn, Chef de Mission, pointed to the future by stating that [...] "We really need to focus on having good-quality athletes who are robust and have financial support to get overseas. It's not like living in Austria, Sweden or Germany where you can do this on the weekend and after work." ...|$|E
500|$|By 12 o'clock when I came in {{it looked}} as if we'd lost control of the whole thing. My first {{decision}} was to send a Governor 5 back up to the remand prison {{to see if we could}} hold it, but it was too late. That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant we could have held the remand prison, meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up. Assuming the doors would have held, that sort of thing. But we had about 200 staff on duty, and we must have lost nine or ten casualties of one sort or another and then you lose staff getting the casualties out. We didn't have a lot of the staff come pouring in until about 1 o'clock. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> really bugged us was there an element of April Fool about it. We rang staff up about it, who said [...] "You must be joking, is this an April Fool?" [...] That's what happened when they rang up my home, my son thought it was an April Fool.|$|E

500|$|According to Perry, {{the song}} is about [...] "falling {{in love with a}} foreigner". James Montgomery of MTV News also noted that Perry sings about a [...] "lover from {{different}} dimension". For its single release, the song was reworked to feature two verses from Kanye West, in which he raps about [...] "extraterrestriality". [...] "E.T." [...] opens with the first rap verse by West containing the lines [...] "I got a dirty mind / I got filthy ways / I'm trying to bathe my Ape in your milky way / They callin' me an alien / A big-headed astronaut". Then, using metaphors about extraterrestrials, Perry sings, [...] "You're not like the others / Futuristic lover / Different DNA". The chorus has Perry addressing her lover: [...] "Kiss me, kiss me / Infect me with your love and / Fill me with your poison", claiming to be [...] "ready for abduction". West contributes a second verse to the track, before Perry's final refrain, with heavily auto-tuned vocals: [...] "I know a bar out in Mars / Where they driving spaceships instead of cars". He finishes with a reference to the fictional animated character Shrek and lyrics about [...] "alien sex": [...] "I'mma disrobe you then I'mma probe you / See, I abducted you so <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> to do." [...] Ben Kaplan from National Post noted West's presence on the track was similar to the work on his fourth studio album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008).|$|E
500|$|In her room, Anna replays the {{confrontation}} in her mind, her anger building ("Shall <b>I</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>You</b> <b>What</b> I Think of You?"). [...] Lady Thiang, the King's head wife, tells Anna that the King is troubled by his portrayal in the West as a barbarian, as the British are being urged {{to take over}} Siam as a protectorate. [...] Anna is shocked by the accusations – the King is a polygamist, but he is no barbarian – but she is reluctant to see him after their argument. [...] Lady Thiang convinces her that the King is deserving of support ("Something Wonderful"). [...] Anna goes to him and finds him anxious for reconciliation. [...] The King tells her that the British are sending an envoy to Bangkok to evaluate the situation. [...] Anna [...] "guesses" [...] – the only guise in which the King will accept advice – that the King will receive the envoy in European style, and that the wives will be dressed in Western fashion. [...] Tuptim has been writing a play based on a book that Anna has lent her, Uncle Tom's Cabin, that can {{be presented to the}} guests. [...] News is brought to the King that the British are arriving much earlier than thought, and so Anna and the wives are to stay up all night to prepare. [...] The King assembles his family for a Buddhist prayer for the success of the venture and also promises before Buddha that Anna will receive her own house [...] "as provided in agreement, etc., etc." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the marvellous {{things about}} John Bonham which made things very easy [...] {{was the fact}} that he really knew how to tune his drums, and <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what,</b> that was pretty rare in drummers in those days. He really knew how to make the {{instrument}} sing, and because of that, he could just get so much volume out of it by just playing with his wrists. It was just an astonishing technique that was sort of pretty holistic if you know what I mean.|$|E

2500|$|After filming Cobra, {{the cast}} of The Hooded Falcon sailed for France to be fitted for costumes. After three months, they {{returned}} to the United States, where Valentino's new beard, which he had grown for the film, caused a sensation. [...] "I opened once a paper and <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> was in. It was Rudolph Valentino with a beard upon his chin. My heart stopped off from beating and I fainted dead away, and I never want to come to life until the judgement day," [...] was soon printed in Photoplay. The cast and crew left for Hollywood to begin preparations for the film, but much of the budget was taken up during preproduction. Due to the Valentinos' lavish spending on costumes and sets, Ritz-Carlton terminated the deal with the couple, effectively ending Valentino's contract with Ritz-Carlton.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 June in {{a speech}} {{promoting}} the government's handling of the economy, Treasurer Peter Costello recalled the [...] of the 2004 election: [...] "This [...] is like a highly engineered racing car and <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what,</b> I wouldn't be putting an L-plate driver in the cockpit at the moment". August 2007 saw, {{for the first time}} during an election campaign, a 0.25-point interest-rate rise to 6.5 per cent by the Reserve Bank, the sixth rise since the last election in 2004. Labor used the news to argue that the Coalition could not be trusted to keep interest rates low, while Costello argued that interest rates would be higher under Labor. In November 2007 interest rates were raised for the sixth time since the 2004 election, to a 10-year high of 6.75 per cent. In response to Labor criticism of the government on the rate rises, Howard stated in August 2007 [...] " [...] can scour every transcript, and I will make them available, of every interview that I gave during that election campaign and he will find no such commitment. [...] During October 2007 Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews's decision to cut Australia's refugee intake and expressing public concern about Sudanese migrants was branded as racist.|$|E
