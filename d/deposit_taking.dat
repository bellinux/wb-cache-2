[...] The next day, Winthrop Aldrich, the newly named chairman and president of Chase National Bank, announced Chase {{would do the same}} and that Chase supported prohibiting banks from having securities affiliates. Aldrich also called for prohibiting securities firms from taking deposits. According to Aldrich and his biographer, Aldrich (a lawyer) drafted new language for Glass's bill that became Section 21 of the Glass–Steagall Act. Contemporary observers suggested Aldrich's proposal was aimed at J.P. Morgan & Co. A later Glass–Steagall critic cited Aldrich's involvement as evidence the Rockefellers (who controlled Chase) had used Section 21 to keep J.P. Morgan & Co. (a <b>deposit</b> <b>taking</b> private partnership best known for underwriting securities) from competing with Chase in the commercial banking business.|$|E

60|$|The frozen {{moisture}} of its breathing {{had settled}} on its fur {{in a fine}} powder of frost, and especially were its jowls, muzzle, and eyelashes whitened by its crystalled breath. The man’s red beard and moustache were likewise frosted, but more solidly, the <b>deposit</b> <b>taking</b> the form of ice and increasing with every warm, moist breath he exhaled. Also, the man was chewing tobacco, and the muzzle of ice held his lips so rigidly that {{he was unable to}} clear his chin when he expelled the juice. The result was that a crystal beard of the colour and solidity of amber was increasing its length on his chin. If he fell down it would shatter itself, like glass, into brittle fragments. But he did not mind the appendage. It was the penalty all tobacco-chewers paid in that country, and he had been out before in two cold snaps. They had not been so cold as this, he knew, but by the spirit thermometer at Sixty Mile he knew they had been registered at fifty below and at fifty-five.|$|E
60|$|Along each shore {{which is}} being worn away by the waves, there are being formed mud, sand, and pebbles. This {{detritus}} has, in each locality, {{a more or less}} special character; determined {{by the nature of the}} strata destroyed. In the English Channel it is not the same as in the Irish Channel; on the east coast of Ireland it is not the same as on the west coast; and so throughout. At the mouth of each great river, there is being deposited sediment differing more or less from that deposited at the mouths of other rivers in colour and quality; forming strata which are here red, there yellow, and elsewhere brown, grey, or dirty white. Besides which various formations, going on in deltas and along shores, there are some much wider, and still more strongly contrasted, formations. At the bottom of the Ægean Sea, there is accumulating a bed of Pteropod shells, which will eventually, no doubt, become a calcareous rock. For some hundreds of thousands of square miles, the ocean-bed between Great Britain and North America, is being covered with a stratum of chalk; and over large areas in the Pacific, there are going on deposits of coralline limestone. Thus, there are at this moment being produced in different places multitudinous strata differing from one another in lithological characters. Name at random any part of the sea-bottom, and ask whether the deposit there taking place is like the <b>deposit</b> <b>taking</b> place at some distant part of the sea-bottom, and the almost-certainly correct answer will be--No. The chances are not in favour of similarity, but against it--many to one against it.|$|E

40|$|The {{financial}} regulation architecture {{in both the}} United States and China developed during eras when retail deposits and bank loans were the primary mode of financial intermediation. The function of banks is to transform short-term deposits into longterm loans, while providing liquidity for depositors. Experience has taught regulators hard lessons that this activity must be subject to prudential safeguards, including reserve requirements, principal protection for depositors, and access to a lender of last resort. Without these protections, short-term deposits are subject to bank runs that can destabilize the entire financial system. Over the years, however, financial innovations {{have led to the}} buildup of short-term pools of funding outside the confines of these protections. These shadow deposits play a role similar to traditional <b>deposits,</b> <b>taking</b> short-term funds from individuals and businesses and providing credit to borrowers...|$|R

40|$|Significant magmatic nickel sulfide {{deposits}} in Zimbabwe occur in Archean greenstone belts and Archean to Proterozoic mafic–ultramafic intrusions, such as Madziwa and the Great Dyke. Here, we review exploration criteria for magmatic nickel sulfide <b>deposits,</b> <b>taking</b> into account nickel sulfide mineral systems in general, Zimbabwe's cratonic evolution and the geological {{setting of the}} deposits. We propose that the essential ingredients for nickel sulfide mineral systems in Zimbabwe are (i) proximity to greenstone belts, craton margins and orogenic belts; (ii) large mafic–ultramafic intrusions and their feeders; (iii) crustal contamination of basic–ultrabasic magma with sulfidic crustal lithologies; and (iv) the vicinity to major fault zones that allowed fertile magma to ascend into the upper crust. We {{suggest that there is}} potential for new nickel sulfide discoveries, both within and outside the greenstone belts; including the Karoo flood basalt province, the Mashonaland dolerites, and the Limpopo, Magondi and Zambezi orogenic belts...|$|R
