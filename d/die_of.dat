However, if the person already had coronary heart disease the reduction was 25%. The results emphasize the importance of early identification of FH and treatment with statins.|$|E

5|$|Conservation {{measures}} have included attempts to breed them in captivity {{and to reduce}} fatalities to young at their natural nesting sites. Nearly 15% of the chicks are killed when they fall off the nests and <b>die</b> <b>of</b> starvation, so some conservationists have used nets positioned below the nests to prevent injuries to falling young and then raising these fallen birds in enclosures for about five months before releasing them to join their wild siblings.|$|E
5|$|During {{his major}} league career, Wiggins {{struggled}} with drug addiction, {{which resulted in}} multiple arrests and suspensions from baseball.

He was the first MLB player known to <b>die</b> <b>of</b> AIDS. Long after his death, two of Wiggins' children, Candice and Alan, Jr., became professional basketball players.|$|E

5|$|When parents <b>die</b> <b>of</b> HIV/AIDS, {{extended}} family members usually become the children's primary caregivers: in Malawi, 44% of double orphans are adopted by grandparents or other close relatives. Extended family members often provide crucial support to HIV/AIDS orphans; however, some sources indicate that {{extended family}} members mistreat orphans whose parents {{have died from}} HIV/AIDS. For example, family members {{who are unable to}} support adopted children often arrange early marriages for female orphans, who may then become victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse.|$|E
5|$|After construction, Morris invited {{friends to}} visit, most notably Burne-Jones {{and his wife}} Georgiana, as well as Rossetti and his wife Lizzie Siddal. They aided him in {{painting}} murals on the furniture, walls, and ceilings, much of it based on Arthurian tales, the Trojan War, and Geoffrey Chaucer's stories, while he also designed floral embroideries for the rooms. They also spent much time playing tricks on each other, enjoying games like hide and seek, and singing while accompanied by the piano. Siddall stayed at the House during summer and autumn 1861 as she recovered from a traumatic miscarriage and an addiction to laudanum; she would <b>die</b> <b>of</b> an overdose in February 1862.|$|E

5|$|At the Acme factory, Doom {{reveals his}} plot to destroy Toontown {{with a giant}} machine loaded with dip to build a freeway, the only way past Toontown since Cloverleaf has bought out Los Angeles' tram system. Roger unsuccessfully {{attempts}} to save Jessica, and the couple is tied onto a hook {{in front of the}} machine's hose. Valiant then performs a comedic vaudeville act, causing the weasels to <b>die</b> <b>of</b> laughter; Valiant kicks their leader, Smart Ass, into the machine's Dip vat, killing him instantly. Valiant then fights Doom, who is eventually flattened by a steamroller, but survives. Eddie is shocked when Doom reveals that he is the toon who killed Teddy. Valiant uses a toon mallet with a spring-loaded boxing glove and fires it at a switch that causes the machine to empty its dip onto Doom, dissolving him.|$|E
5|$|Because B.brownii {{releases}} its seed {{in response}} to bushfire, {{it is important that}} fires occur at intervals that allow the plants to generate plenty of viable seed. The optimum fire interval is around 18 years. If fire occurs too frequently, plants are burned before reaching maturity or before they have produced sufficient seed to ensure regeneration of the population. This may cause populations to decline, or even local extinction. Too-infrequent fire also causes population decline, as more plants <b>die</b> <b>of</b> natural attrition without releasing their seed, resulting in seed wastage.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{proceeds}} to the enclave, {{where he is}} met by Breed, who accepts Bond's cover as a journalist.

Bond sees supply flights of arms and equipment coming into the country, all funded by billionaire Hulbert Linck; the aeroplanes all show the AfriKIN name on the fuselage. When Adeka dies a few days later, Bond tries {{to leave the country}} on one of the supply flights, but is confronted by Breed and Blessing, who both shoot him and leave him to die.|$|E

5|$|CARE International proposes several {{strategies}} that might reduce the destructive {{economic impact of}} HIV/AIDS on rural households. They recommend introducing new technologies that improve productivity to allow households affected by HIV/AIDS to continue supporting themselves through agriculture. Women in patrilineal/patrilocal villages are often unable to support {{themselves and their children}} when their husbands <b>die</b> <b>of</b> HIV/AIDS; therefore, helping women acquire traditionally masculine agricultural skills might decrease their vulnerability while improving agricultural productivity at the household and community levels. CARE International recommends increasing cooperation at the community level by establishing labor and food banks in areas that have been devastated by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Finally, CARE International highlights the importance of increasing access to information about HIV/AIDS in Malawi to help families prepare for and cope with the economic burdens associated with the epidemic.|$|E
5|$|Fireflash is {{recalled}} and Captain Hanson and his co-pilot {{instructed to}} circle the airspace above the airport. The shielding on the airliner's atomic reactor is weakening; if Fireflash does not land within two hours, the passengers and crew will <b>die</b> <b>of</b> radiation exposure. Air Traffic Control commandeers an Air Force jet called a TX-204 Target Carrying Aircraft that docks with Fireflash in flight, allowing a Lieutenant Bob Meddings to board the hold and attempt to remove the bomb. Meddings is almost killed when he falls through the unclosed maintenance hatch and plummets to the ground; moments before impact, however, he successfully deploys his parachute and ultimately survives.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} match of the 1931–32 season, which was against Queensland, New South Wales were in trouble. Gilbert famously knocked the bat out of Donald Bradman's hand, before {{removing}} {{him for a}} duck.

Undeterred, Stan McCabe came in and counterattacked; Fingleton assisted him with a stubborn 93 and featured in a 195-run fourth wicket partnership.
