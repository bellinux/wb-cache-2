5|$|This type of sundial {{is known}} as an {{equatorial}} sundial because {{the plane of the}} dial face <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth's equatorial plane. Two primary examples of modified equatorial sundials are bowstring equatorial and armillary dials. Both of these modified equatorial sundials can be read year-round on the same surface, regardless of whether the Sun is above or below the equatorial plane whereas a standard equatorial sundial changes sides with each equinox and is virtually unreadable near the equinoxes when the Sun is located on the equatorial plane.|$|E
5|$|Inferences about {{behavior}} {{can also be}} drawn from examination of the inner ear. The semicircular canals within the inner ear aid in balance, and the lateral semicircular canal is usually {{parallel to the ground}} when the animal holds its head in an alert posture. When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its lateral canal <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, the entire skull is nearly horizontal. This contrasts with many other theropods, where the head was more strongly downturned when in the alert position. The lateral canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus, indicating a greater sensitivity to side-to-side motions of the head.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the year {{different}} sections of the rod serve as the style, which is the part of the gnomon that indicates the time by casting its shadow on the dial face. At the summer solstice, when the Sun is highest (farthest above the equatorial plane), the style is closest to the top of the rod, and at the winter solstice, when the Sun is lowest, it is closest to the bottom. At the equinoxes, when the Sun is on the equatorial plane, the style is exactly in the center of the length of the rod. The style of the equatorial sundial <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E

5|$|To {{perform a}} bicycle kick, the ball must be {{airborne}} {{so that the}} player can hit it while doing a backflip; the ball can either come in the air towards the player, such as from a cross, or the player can flick the ball up into the air. The non-kicking leg should rise first to help propel the body up while the kicking leg makes the jump. While making the leap, the body's back should move rearwards until it <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. As the body reaches peak height, the kicking leg should snap toward the ball as the non-kicking leg is simultaneously brought down to increase the kick's power. Vision should stay focused on the ball until the foot strikes it. The arms {{should be used for}} balance and to diminish the impact from the fall.|$|E

Two special cases might be noted: when the original line <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> real axis, the resulting spiral never closes in on itself; when the original line <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> imaginary axis, the resulting spiral is a circle of some radius.|$|E

25|$|Figure 19a {{shows the}} network of boron icosahedra in the boron {{framework}} of ScB19+xSiy. In this network, 4 icosahedra form a supertetrahedron (figure 18b); its one edge <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> a-axis, and the icosahedra on this edge make up a chain along the a-axis. The opposite edge of the supertetrahedron <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> b-axis and the icosahedra on this edge form a chain along the b-axis. As shown in figure 19, there are wide tunnels surrounded by the icosahedron arrangement along the a- and b-axes. The tunnels are filled by the B22 units which strongly bond to the surrounding icosahedra; the connection of the B22 units is helical and it runs along the c-axis {{as shown in figure}} 19b. Scandium atoms occupy the voids in the boron network as shown in figure 19c, and the Si atoms bridge the B22 units.|$|E
50|$|In geometry, true {{length is}} any {{distance}} between points {{that is not}} foreshortened by the view type. In a three-dimensional Euclidean space, lines with true length <b>are</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> projection plane. For example, in a top view of a pyramid, which is an orthographic projection, the base edges (which <b>are</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> projection plane) have true length, whereas the remaining edges in this view are not true lengths. The same is true with an orthographic side view of a pyramid. If any face of a pyramid <b>was</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> projection plane (for a particular view), all edges would demonstrate true length.|$|R

25|$|The law of {{superposition}} allows Coulomb's law to {{be extended}} to include any number of point charges. The force acting on a point charge due {{to a system of}} point charges is simply the vector addition of the individual forces acting alone on that point charge due to each one of the charges. The resulting force vector <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> electric field vector at that point, with that point charge removed.|$|E

The analysis of the curve for an optimal arch is similar except that the forces of tension become forces of compression and everything is inverted.|$|E

25|$|The {{projection}} of a vector {{on a plane}} is its orthogonal projection on that plane. The rejection of a vector from a plane is its orthogonal projection on a straight line which is orthogonal to that plane. Both are vectors. The first <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plane, the second is orthogonal. For a given vector and plane, the sum of projection and rejection {{is equal to the}} original vector.|$|E
25|$|A {{waveplate}} {{works by}} shifting the phase between two perpendicular polarization {{components of the}} light wave. A typical waveplate is simply a birefringent crystal with a carefully chosen orientation and thickness. The crystal is cut into a plate, with {{the orientation of the}} cut chosen so that the optic axis of the crystal <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surfaces of the plate. This results in two axes in the plane of the cut: the ordinary axis, with index of refraction no, and the extraordinary axis, with index of refraction ne. The ordinary axis is perpendicular to the optic axis. The extraordinary axis <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> optic axis. For a light wave normally incident upon the plate, polarization component along the ordinary axis travels through the crystal with a speed vo = c/no, while the polarization component along the extraordinary axis travels with a speed ve = c/ne. This leads to a phase difference between the two components as they exit the crystal. When ne< no, as in calcite, the extraordinary axis is called the fast axis and the ordinary axis is called the slow axis. For nenbsp&> no the situation is reversed.|$|E
