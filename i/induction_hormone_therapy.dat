40|$|The review {{describes}} briefly {{the clinical}} and endocrinological characteristics of chronic hyperandrogenic anovulation (CHA), {{as well as}} ovulation <b>induction</b> by <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> (therapy of first choice) and by classical wedge resection. The main purpose of this study, however, is to compare different laparoscopic treatments of CHA, with emphasis on laser treatments by argon, CO 2, Nd:YAG, and frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser. The overall results of laparoscopic treatments in hormone-therapy-resistant patients with CHA are encouraging {{and the results are}} comparable. In the studies considered in this review, ovulation was induced for longer or shorter periods in 21 out of 31 patients (68 %) after ovarian biopsy, in 57 out of 73 patients (78 %) after electrosurgery, and in 82 out of 118 patients (70 %) after laser treatment. Subsequent conception occurred in 44 %, 40 %, and in 41 % of the patients, respectively. Of interest is the fact that some hormone-therapy-resistant patients become sensitive to Clomiphene after laparoscopic treatment, giving an overall percentage of ovulation and an overall pregnancy rate of 89 % and 54 %, respectively, for electrosurgery, and of 88 % and 50 %, respectively, for laser treatment.

40|$|Intrinsic or {{acquired}} {{resistance to}} <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> is frequently reported in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients. Even though dysregulations of histone deacetylases (HDACs) {{are known to}} promote cancer cells survival, the role of different HDACs in the <b>induction</b> of <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> resistance in ER+ breast cancer remains unclear. Survivin is a well-known pro-tumor survival molecule and miR- 125 a- 5 p is a recently discovered tumor suppressor. In this study, we found that ER+, hormone-independent, tamoxifen-resistant MCF 7 -TamC 3 cells exhibit increased expression of HDAC 2, HDAC 5, and survivin, but show decreased expression of miR- 125 a- 5 p, {{as compared to the}} parental tamoxifen-sensitive MCF 7 breast cancer cells. Molecular down-regulations of HDAC 2, HDAC 5, and survivin, and ectopic over-expression of miR- 125 a- 5 p, increased the sensitivity of MCF 7 -TamC 3 cells to estrogen deprivation and restored the sensitivity to tamoxifen. The same treatments also further increased the sensitivity to estrogen-deprivation in the ER+ hormone-dependent ZR- 75 - 1 breast cancer cells in vitro. Kaplan–Meier analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of expression cohorts of breast tumor showed that high HDAC 2 and survivin, and low miR- 125 a- 5 p, expression levels correlate with poor relapse-free survival in endocrine therapy and tamoxifen-treated ER+ breast cancer patients. Further molecular analysis revealed that HDAC 2 and HDAC 5 positively modulates the expression of survivin, and negatively regulates the expression miR- 125 a- 5 p, in ER+ MCF 7, MCF 7 -TamC 3, and ZR- 75 - 1 breast cancer cells. These findings indicate that dysregulations of HDAC 2 and HDAC 5 promote the development of hormone independency and tamoxifen resistance in ERC breast cancer cells in part through expression regulation of survivin and miR- 125 a- 5 p...|$|R
40|$|Context: Although {{there is}} {{increasing}} interest {{in the use of}} neoadjuvant or adjuvant <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> with local treatment for patients with prostate cancer (PCa), the survival benefit of <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> is still debated. In addition, <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> is associated with adverse events, which can have negative effects on a patient's quality of life (QoL). Intermittent <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> is being investigated as an alternative to continuous <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> for advanced PCa with the aims of delaying progression to hormone-refractory PCa and minimising adverse events. Objective: To summarise current controversies on <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> for PCa. Evidence acquisition: This manuscript is based on presentations given at a satellite symposium held at the 2 nd World Congress on Controversies in Urology (CURy) in Lisbon, Portugal. Recent English-language reports were identified through a search of Medline and abstracts of scientific congresses on <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> for PCa. Data from review papers, original papers, and abstracts were compiled and interpreted. Evidence synthesis: Neoadjuvant <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> with radical prostatectomy (RP) does not seem to offer a survival advantage over RP alone in patients with localised and locally advanced PCa. Neoadjuvant <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> with radiotherapy (RT) appears to improve treatment outcomes over RT alone in patients with locally advanced PCa, but the impact on overall survival is still unclear. Adjuvant <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> with RT seems to increase overall survival in high-risk localised and locally advanced PCa. Final results of a phase 3 trial suggest that intermittent <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> improves QoL without a negative effect on overall survival compared with continuous <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy.</b> Furthermore, the patient-physician dialogue should be enhanced and patients' preferences should be taken into consideration in the decision-making process. Conclusions: Neoadjuvant or adjuvant <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> with radical treatment may improve survival in carefully selected patients with PCa. Intermittent <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> seems to reduce adverse events and improve QoL without a negative effect on survival. The availability of different formulations of a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist offers patients an individualised treatment approach. © 2009 European Association of Urology.

We investigated whether the effect of <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> use is modified by polymorphisms in the estrogen receptor (ESR 1) and progesterone receptor (PGR) genes in the Dutch Prospect-EPIC and the English EPIC-Norfolk cohorts. Information on <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> use was obtained through questionnaires at recruitment and after 5 years. Blood samples were collected and consecutive mammograms were available through breast cancer screening programs. For 795 <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> users, one mammogram before and a second mammogram during <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> use was included. For 781 never <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> users, mammograms with similar time intervals were included. Mammographic density was assessed using a computer-assisted method. Changes in density were analyzed using linear regression. A statistically significant difference in percentage density change between <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> users and never users was seen in women with the ESR 1 PvuII Pp or pp genotype (2. 24 %; P < 0. 01), but not in those with the PP genotype (0. 90 %; P = 0. 47). Similarly, effects of <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> on percentage density were observed in women with the ESR 1 XbaI Xx or xx genotype (2. 20 %; P < 0. 01), but not in those with the XX genotype (- 0. 65 %; P = 0. 70).

40|$|Objectives: Due to the {{increased}} diagnosis of prostate cancer at earlier stages and the overall increased use of <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy,</b> also in earlier disease stages, many patients will receive long-term <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy.</b> Therefore, the timing of initiating <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> {{and the type of}} <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> have become crucial items in the appropriate management of patients with prostate cancer. in addition, as patients receiving long-term <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> are at an increased risk of acute and chronic side effects, the monitoring of these patients deserves attention. The timing and type of <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> and the monitoring of patients receiving <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> are reviewed in this paper. Methods: A literature review was performed in Medline. Results: The prostate specific antigen doubling time (PSA DT) has been evaluated to determine the risk of disease progression in patients having a relapse after radical therapy. Patients with a PSA DT of < 12 mo have a high risk for disease progression and should probably receive <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> rapidly. In case of a diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer, there is not yet a consensus on when to start <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy.</b> During an interactive voting session, over 200 urologists indicated that the preferred luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist should be able to achieve a castrate level of <= 20 ng/dl, as well as to maintain these low testosterone levels without inducing acute-on-chronic or breakthrough responses. Eligard, a novel depot formulation of leuprolide acetate, appears to be the only LHRH agonist currently available able to achieve and maintain serum testosterone levels below the castrate level of 20 ng/dl. Patients receiving long-term <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> should be adequately monitored during follow-up visits. Besides frequent assessment of the PSA level and other recommended assessments, serum testosterone levels should also be determined. In this way, response to therapy can be evaluated, relevant testosterone rises after initial treatment response can be detected, and potential reasons for unexpected PSA rises can be verified, which will improve the monitoring of patients receiving <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy.</b> Conclusions: Measuring testosterone levels before and during therapy initiation might improve <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> decisions and monitoring. Eligard is an interesting LHRH agonist because it is able to achieve and maintain testosterone levels below 20 ng/dl. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

After discussion, readers found 86 % of the articles to be scientifically accurate and 64 % to be promotional in tone. Themes that were common in articles considered promotional included attacks on the methodology of the WHI, arguments that clinical trial results should not guide treatment for individuals, and arguments that observational studies are as good as or better than randomized clinical trials for guiding clinical decisions. The promotional articles we identified also implied that the risks associated with <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> have been exaggerated and that the benefits of <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> have been or will be proven. Of the ten authors studied, eight were found to have declared payment for speaking or consulting on behalf of menopausal hormone manufacturers or for research support (seven of these eight were speakers or consultants). Thirty of 32 articles (90 %) evaluated as promoting <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> were authored by those with potential financial conflicts of interest, compared to 11 of 18 articles (61 %) by those without such conflicts (p= 0. 0025).

30|$|<b>Hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> {{has been}} {{successfully}} used to treat estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer for a few decades. About 70 % of all breast cancers are ER+ and, thus, potentially sensitive to <b>hormone</b> <b>therapies</b> [1]. However, loss of positivity, reduction of the receptor expression, and/or loss of estrogen growth dependence (to name a few) can sometimes induce resistance to <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> [2, 3]. Other mechanisms of resistance were proposed, such as overexpression and crosstalk of growth factors and growth factor receptors with ER pathways [4 – 6]. Also, {{a significant proportion of}} ER+ tumors fails to respond to some or all hormone treatments [1, 7]. Hence, the contribution of estrogen receptor expression levels to the mechanisms of resistance is yet to be elucidated.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe the impact of new <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> recommendations on patients' attitudes and decision-making in a primary care practice. Methods A questionnaire including structured and open-ended questions was administered in a family practice office waiting room from August through October 2003. Rationale for taking or not taking <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> was specifically sought. Women 50 – 70 years old attending for office visits were invited to participate. Data were analyzed qualitatively and with descriptive statistics. Chart review provided medication use rates for the entire practice cohort of which the sample was a subset. Results Respondents (n = 127) were predominantly white and well educated, and were taking <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> at a higher rate (38 %) than the overall rate (26 %) for women of the same age range in this practice.

Methods: Eligible patients were men with newly diagnosed or rapidly relapsing prostate cancer who were starting long-term <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> for the first time. <b>Hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> was given as standard care in all trial arms, with local radiotherapy encouraged for newly diagnosed patients without distant metastasis. Randomisation was done using minimisation with a random element across seven stratification factors. Patients randomly allocated to arm D received celecoxib 400 mg twice daily, given orally, until 1 year or disease progression (including prostate-specific antigen [PSA] failure). The intermediate outcome was failure-free survival (FFS) in three activity stages; the primary outcome was overall survival in a subsequent efficacy stage. Research arms were compared pairwise against the control arm on an intention-to-treat basis. Accrual of further patients was discontinued in any research arm showing safety concerns or insufficient evidence of activity (lack of benefit) compared with the control arm. The minimum targeted activity at the second intermediate activity stage was a hazard ratio (HR) of 0 · 92.

Pooled ORR to <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> was 71. 0 % (95 % Confidence Interval 52 - 85). In 25. 8 % a complete response and in 45. 2 % a partial response was described. Four patients had stable disease. In five patients disease was progressive. Various hormone treatments showed different results, for instance aromatase inhibitors (AI) demonstrated response in nine out of nine therapies (100 %) and tamoxifen in none out of three (0 %). Median progression free survival (PFS) {{after the start of}} <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> was 18 months (range 0 - 60).

40|$|Hannelore Rott Coagulation Center Rhine-Ruhr, Duisburg, Germany Abstract: Many large {{trials in}} the past 15 years have proven an {{increased}} risk of vascular complications in women using oral, mostly non-bioidentical, <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy.</b> The risk of vascular complications depends on the route of administration (oral versus transdermal), age, duration of administration, and type of hormones (bioidentical versus non-bioidentical). Acquired and/or hereditary thrombophilias (eg, factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation G 20210 A, and others) lead to a further increase of risk for venous thromboembolism, stroke, or myocardial infarction. Therefore, bioidentical <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> via the transdermal route seems to be the safest opportunity for <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy,</b> although large trials for bioidentical <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> are needed.

40|$|Objective: According to the {{guidelines}} for metastatic breast cancer, <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> for <b>hormone</b> receptor–positive metastatic breast cancer without life-threatening metastasis should be received prior to chemotherapy. Previous trials have investigated the sensitivity of chemotherapy for preoperative breast cancer based on the efficacy of neoadjuvant <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy.</b> In this retrospective study, we investigated the efficacy of chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer in hormone therapy–effective and hormone therapy–ineffective cases. Methods: Patients who received chemotherapy after <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> for metastatic breast cancer between 2006 and 2013 at our institution were investigated. Results: A total of 32 patients received chemotherapy after <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> for metastatic breast cancer. The median patient age was 59 [*]years, {{and most of the}} primary tumors exhibited a T 2 status. A total of 26 patients had an N(+) status, while 7 patients had human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 –positive tumors. A total of 13 patients received clinical benefits from <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy,</b> with a rate of clinical benefit of subsequent chemotherapy of 30. 8 %, which was not significantly different from that observed in the hormone therapy–ineffective patients (52. 6 %). A total of 13 patients were able to continue the <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> for more than 1 [*]year, with a rate of clinical benefit of chemotherapy of 38. 5 %, which was not significantly different from that observed in the short-term <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> patients (47. 4 %). The luminal A patients were able to continue <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> for a significantly longer period than the non-luminal A patients (median survival time: 17. 8 [*]months vs 6. 35 [*]months, p[*]=[*] 0. 0085). However, {{there were no significant differences}} in the response to or duration of chemotherapy. Conclusion: The efficacy of chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer cannot be predicted based on the efficacy of prior <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> or tumor subtype, and clinicians should administer chemotherapy in all cases of hormone receptor–positive metastatic breast cancer, if needed...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine recent trends in the {{prescribing}} of <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> for menopause, tibolone, and bisphosphonate preparations for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis, in the UK in relation to publication of research evidence on the health effects of <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> and subsequent changes in prescribing advice. METHODS: Individual patient-level data were obtained on the prescribing of <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy,</b> tibolone, and bisphosphonates by general practitioners in the UK between 1991 and 2005 to women aged 40 years and older in the UK General Practice Research Database. Overall and age-specific prescribing prevalence were calculated for each therapy type. Prescribing prevalence was also calculated for subcategories of <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> and bisphosphonates. RESULTS: Prescribing of <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> to women aged 40 years and older increased between 1991 and 1996 and remained fairly stable between 1997 and 2001. <b>Hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> prescribing has fallen by about 50 % since 2002. Tibolone, a selective tissue estrogenic activity regulator, is prescribed much less commonly than <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> but shows a similar pattern. Prescribing of bisphosphonates increased rapidly throughout the study period, particularly in women aged 70 years and older, with the pattern of prescribing reflecting to some extent, the availability of new weekly formulations. CONCLUSIONS: Trends in the prescribing of <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> in the UK appear to closely reflect new epidemiological evidence and prescribing advice. It is likely that the substantial fall in <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> and tibolone prescribing seen since 2002 is a direct consequence of the publication of Women's Health Initiative trial results and subsequent changes in advice given by the Committee on Safety of Medicines. The 1997 publication of results from the Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer and 2003 publication of the Million Women Study findings may also have impacted on trends, particularly within certain age groups. The substantial and continuing increase in prescribing prevalence of bisphosphonates reinforces the need for research into the long-term risks and benefits of these therapies...|$|R

Since the introduction of <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> for the treatment of prostate cancer, there has been a debate about the optimal timing of <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy.</b> A modification in the timing of <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> produced new candidates for hormone manipulation. In particular, the use of hormone treatment for younger patients, longer periods and early prostate cancer, absolutely requires a whole re-evaluation of which therapy is indicated and it may produce new problems such as higher risk of over-treatment, need of a better evaluation of quality of life in younger patients and the research for better tolerated therapies. Therapies that resist for longer periods without the production of a hormone-refractory disease are also required.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the isolated and associated effects of estrogen therapy (estradiol valerate 1 mg/d orally) and physical exercise (moderate aerobic exercise, 3 h/wk) on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and menopausal symptoms among women who had undergone hysterectomy. Design: A 6 -month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with 44 postmenopausal women who had undergone hysterectomy. The interventions were physical exercise and <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> (n = 9), being sedentary and <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> (n = 14), physical exercise and placebo (n = 11), and being sedentary and placebo (n = 10). HRQOL was assessed by a Brazilian standard version of the Medical Outcome Study Short-Forrn Health Survey and symptoms by Kupperman Index at baseline and after 6 months. Results: There was a decrease in symptoms in all groups, but only groups who performed physical exercise showed an increase in quality of life. Analysis of variance showed that changes in physical functioning (P = 0. 001) and bodily pain (P = 0. 012) scores over the 6 -month period differed significantly between women who exercised and women who were sedentary, regardless of <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy.</b> <b>Hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> had no effect, and there was also no significant association between physical exercise and <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> in HRQOL.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} effect of <b>hormone</b> {{replacement}} <b>therapy</b> on life expectancy in postmenopausal women with different risk profiles for heart disease, breast cancer, and hip fracture. DESIGN: Decision analysis using a Markov model. Published regression models were used to link risk factors to disease incidence and to estimate the lifetime risks of developing coronary heart disease (CHD), breast cancer, hip fracture, and endometrial cancer. The impact of <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> on disease incidence was estimated from published epidemiologic studies. SETTING: Mathematical model applicable to primary care. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> or no <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Life expectancy. RESULTS: <b>Hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> should increase life expectancy for nearly all postmenopausal women, with some gains exceeding 3 years, depending mainly on an individual 2 ̆ 7 s risk factors for CHD and breast cancer. For women with at least 1 risk factor for CHD, <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> should extend life expectancy, even for women having first-degree relatives with breast cancer. Women without any risk factors for CHD or hip fracture, but who have 2 first-degree relatives with breast cancer, however, should not receive <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The benefit of <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> in reducing the likelihood of developing CHD appears to outweigh {{the risk of breast cancer}} for nearly all women in whom this treatment might be considered.

40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of hypertension and use of antihypertensive drug therapy in relation to menopausal status and to delineate perceived associations between androgens and blood pressure in perimenopausal women. Methods A population- based sample of women aged 50 - 59 (nU 6893). Women were divided into three groups according to their hormonal status: premenopausal, postmenopausal without <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy,</b> and postmenopausal with <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy.</b> Result In the premenopausal, postmenopausal without <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy,</b> and postmenopausal with <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> groups, {{the prevalence of}} high blood pressure (>= - 140 mmHg systolic or >= 90 mmHg diastolic) was 43. 9, 49. 9 and 45. 8 %, respectively. In women with normal blood pressure, adjusting for age, body mass index and smoking, there were negative associations between serum testosterone and systolic blood pressure in the total sample (P< 0. 01) and the postmenopausal without <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> group (P< 0. 05). In women using antihypertensive drug therapy with a blood pressure of at least 140 / 90 mmHg, positive associations were found between serum testosterone and systolic blood pressure in the total series (P< 0. 05) and in the postmenopausal without <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> group (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a {{superfamily}} of transcription {{factors that}} can be activated by ligands and thereby regulate the activation {{of a variety of}} genes for, amongst others, homeostasis. Nowadays, these NRs represent very important targets for endocrine therapeutic drug development. However, it is known that some patients (eventually) become resistant towards this therapy. An example is glucocorticoid (GC) <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> resistance in asthmatic patients. <b>Hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> resistance harbours a large clinical burden with severe consequences. It is still poorly understood why and how some people develop <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> resistance. In order to predict and/or prevent resistance development by novel therapies, it is of significant relevance to investigate the (possible) cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the physiology and pathology. Various mechanisms that contribute to GC <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> resistance have already been described in the literature. However, the exact mechanism still remains inconclusive. Therefore, this review describes the current insights to and the currently known mechanisms behind the development of GC <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> resistance in asthmatic patients. In addition, we tried to unravel novel cellular and molecular mechanisms involved. Based on the data reviewed in this thesis, it is hypothesized that the changes and alterations of posttranscriptional modifications of coregulators lead to changes in the actions of glucocorticoid receptors (members of the NR super family) and thereby eventually lead to GC <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> resistance...|$|R
