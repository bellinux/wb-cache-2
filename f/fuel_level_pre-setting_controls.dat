30|$|Gong, et al. [110], {{established}} a shape <b>pre-setting</b> <b>control</b> {{model of a}} 6 -high reversing cold rolling mill based on the data regression method. Another regression model of shape <b>pre-setting</b> <b>control</b> for the 6 -high reversing cold rolling mill was established {{based on the results}} of the influence function method [111]. The regression models possess the advantages of simple structure and high calculation speed. Based on the mechanism model, Bai, et al. [112], divided shape pre-setting course into two steps, namely rough calculation step and precise calculation step, and a set of optimization algorithm was proposed to improve calculation speed. Wang [2] developed the models and softwares of shape <b>pre-setting</b> <b>control</b> for cold rolling strip according to the basic model of shape theory, which was successfully applied to multiple sets of cold rolling mills. The models and softwares are characterized by the strip element method. Under the premise of ensuring model accuracy, the calculation speed is improved significantly by the multistep optimization strategy. The pre-setting calculation time is less than 1 s.|$|R
30|$|The {{shape control}} {{system can be}} divided into <b>pre-setting</b> <b>control</b> system and {{closed-loop}} control system according to the control sequence, and the modelling of shape control system includes mechanism and intelligent models. <b>Pre-setting</b> <b>control</b> is a predictive control, and closed-loop control is a monitoring control. The two control systems complement each other and ensure the strip shape quality. The mechanism models are based on solid theoretical basis and have strong expansibility, {{but it is hard to}} realize accurate modelling and fast calculation. The intelligent models demonstrate strong learning capability, fast calculation speed, and simple modeling but poor analyticity and scalability. Coordination between these two models can effectively improve the control level. The shape control system of cold rolling strip is a complex control system with multiple variables, strong coupling, and nonlinearity. For a long time, the whole set of shape control system can only be provided by German’s SIEMENS, Japan’s MITSUBISHI, or other large international companies. In the past 10 years, several new computer control systems are developed for the cold rolling strip. Its industrial applications have achieved good results [107 – 109].|$|R

Traditional <b>pre-setting</b> <b>control</b> method based on data statistical can not meet the complex needs of the current traffic control.

Experiments show that this method not only can improve the passage efficiency of intersection, but also provide more predicted result as well compared to the network-based control methods...|$|R
50|$|To {{reduce the}} weight, the <b>level</b> of <b>fuel</b> carried is altered: for {{intermodal}} applications the <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> is 7,300 litres, for coal applications that permit higher axle loads the <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> is increased to 13,500 litres, with an intermediate <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> of 10,750 litres also available. These limits are enforced during refuelling by {{a float switch}} in the tank, the permitted level being set by a key switch with an indication displayed in the cab if the limits are breached. The provision of inline refuelling permits the topping up of the tanks in transit from a separate tank wagon behind the locomotives.|$|R

5000|$|Magnetoresistance type <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> sensors, now {{becoming}} common in small aircraft applications, offer a potential alternative for automotive use. These <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> sensors work {{similar to the}} potentiometer example, however a sealed detector at the float pivot determines the angular position of a magnet pair at the pivot end of the float arm. These are highly accurate, and the electronics are completely outside the fuel. The non-contact nature of these sensors address the fire and explosion hazard, and also the issues related to any fuel combinations or additives to gasoline or to any alcohol fuel mixtures. Magneto resistive sensors are suitable for all fuel or fluid combinations, including LPG and LNG. The <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> output for these senders can be ratiometric voltage or preferable CAN bus digital. These sensors also fail-safe in that they either provide a level output or nothing.|$|R
50|$|The {{system can}} be fail-safe. If an {{electrical}} fault opens, the electrical circuit causes the indicator to show the tank as being empty (theoretically provoking the driver to refill the tank) rather than full (which would allow the driver {{to run out of}} fuel with no prior notification). Corrosion or wear of the potentiometer will provide erroneous readings of <b>fuel</b> <b>level.</b> However, this system has a potential risk associated with it. An electric current is sent through the variable resistor to which a float is connected, so that the value of resistance depends on the <b>fuel</b> <b>level.</b> In most automotive fuel gauges such resistors are on the inward side of the gauge, i.e., inside the fuel tank. Sending current through such a resistor has a fire hazard and an explosion risk associated with it. These resistance sensors are also showing an increased failure rate with the incremental additions of alcohol in automotive gasoline fuel. Alcohol increases the corrosion rate at the potentiometer, as it is capable of carrying current like water. Potentiometer applications for alcohol fuel use a pulse-and-hold methodology, with a periodic signal being sent to determine <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> decreasing the corrosion potential. Therefore, demand for another safer, non-contact method for <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> is desired.|$|R
