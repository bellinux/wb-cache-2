60|$|What I {{conceive}} to be {{the reality}} of the religious revival {{is to be found in}} quarters remote from the religious professionals. Let me give but one instance of several that occur to me. I met soon after my return from France a man who has stirred my curiosity for years, Mr. David Lubin, the prime mover in the organisation of the <b>International</b> <b>Institute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> in Rome. It is a movement that has always appealed to my imagination. The idea is to establish and keep up to date a record of the food supplies in the world with a view to the ultimate world control of food supply and distribution. When its machinery has developed sufficiently to a control in the interests of civilisation of many other staples besides foodstuffs. It is in fact the suggestion and beginning of the economic world peace and the economic world state, just as the Hague Tribunal is the first faint sketch of a legal world state. The King of Italy has met Mr. Lubin's idea with open hands. (It was because of this profoundly interesting experiment that in a not very widely known book of mine, The World Set Free (May, 1914), in which I represented a world state as arising out of Armageddon, I made the first world conference meet at Brissago in Italian Switzerland under the presidency of the King of Italy.) So that when I found I could meet Mr. Lubin I did so very gladly. We lunched together in a pretty little room high over Knightsbridge, and talked through an afternoon.|$|E

The objective is to get an optimum yield of millet m addition to cowpea grain and fodder.

Tests carried out over three years showed that intercropped cowpea and millet yields are partly dependent on cowpea plant type. The results indicated that the cowpea cultivar that was spreading and indeterminate competed least with the millet.
