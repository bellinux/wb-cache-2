40|$|The {{first part}} of the report proposes a {{methodology}} for gear windage loss evaluation using CFD analysis. The methodology includes simplification of gearbox complex geometry and the toothed wheel and pinion are replaced by a rough-walled disks with additional braking volume forces. The values of volume forces were determined using auxiliary computations with a real gear geometry (a <b>gear</b> <b>segment</b> with periodical boundary conditions). The computations included configuration of the gear wheel meshing with the pinion, while distance of wheel enclosure was a variable parameter (the case without enclosure was tested as well). The cases without pinion were computed too, they were compared with earlier results obtained with the <b>gear</b> <b>segment</b> geometry. second part of the report contains a revision of the earlier proposed analytical approach. The approach can serve for approximate gear windage loss evaluation and its idea dwells in smooth connection of logarithmic velocity profiles. The gear windage loss values obtained from the analytical approach were compared with the results based on CFD analysis. A good agreement between both methods was concluded. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{approach}} for cutting simulation of skive hobbing is presented. Skive hobbing is a process applied for finishing of already hardened gears. The process is characterized by varying tool engagements and very small chip thicknesses. The paper describes the process-modeling and {{the analysis of the}} workpiece-tool contact. For efficient modeling, a novel dexel-based method is presented for the description of a <b>gear</b> <b>segment</b> with discretized stock allowance. Characteristic of the method is an analytical description of the target workpiece contour which allows to describe points of the surface by Cartesian coordinates on the winding off. Dexel are oriented orthogonal {{to the surface of the}} final workpiece contour. The initial lengths of the dexel describe the stock allowance. By cutting these dexel with a tool, a time- and position-dependent prediction of material removal values, e. g. width of undeformed chip or undeformed chip thickness, is possible.

40|$|The {{formation}} of harvest cooperatives has recently generated considerable interest among fishermen and regulators {{as an alternative}} to other rights-based systems such as individual transferable quotas. Many consider the promotion of self-governance to be essential to more sustainable, equitable and efficient management of commercial fisheries. This dissertation examines the incentives created by the allocation of collective fishing rights as a mechanism for inducing the creation of cooperatives (or sectors). A theoretical model of the fishery characterizes necessary and sufficient conditions for the {{formation of}} sectors when harvesters have incomplete information on how to organize collective fishing but instead must learn by doing. The equilibria of the dynamic sector-formation game played by the heterogeneous fishermen shows that sectors may fail to form if permit holders are unfamiliar with cooperative harvesting. Conversely, when sectors do organize, the least skilled fishermen join first and the scope of their cooperation, as given by the number of tasks they choose to coordinate, increases progressively over time until the uncertainty is fully resolved. Profitability, in turn, benefits from enhanced cooperation. 	I test the predictions of the model using a panel data set from the hook <b>gear</b> <b>segment</b> in the New England Multispecies Fishery to estimate a stochastic output distance function and a technical inefficiency model. The simultaneous estimation of both equations allows the full characterization of the underlying multi-output technology and the assessment of key determinants of technical efficiency such as vessel characteristics, congestion conditions and cooperation. The results show that the least efficient vessels were the first to join the Georges Bank Cod Hook sector in 2004, and present evidence of earlier cooperation among these vessels (i. e. previous to the institutionalization of the group as a sector), hence suggesting familiarity with collective harvesting when joining the sector. Additionally, the resulst demonstrate that technical efficiency was higher for sector vessels than common pool boats during the sector years and increased during this period...|$|E

40|$|Fuel {{costs are}} an {{important}} element in models used to analyse and predict fisher behaviour for application within the wider mixed fisheries and ecosystem approaches to management. This investigation explored the predictive capability of linear and generalized additive models (GAMs) in providing daily fuel consumption estimates for fishing vessels given knowledge of their length, engine power, fleet <b>segment</b> (annual dominant <b>gear</b> type), and fuel prices. Models were fitted to half of the Irish fishing vessel economic data collected between 2003 and 2011. The predictive capabilities of the seven best models were validated against the remaining, previously un-modelled, data. The type of gear used by a fleet segment had an important influence on fuel consumption as did the price of fuel. The passive pot gear and Scottish seine <b>gear</b> <b>segments</b> indicated consistently lower consumptions, whereas dredge and pelagic gears showed consistently higher fuel consumptions. Furthermore, increasing fuel price negatively affected fuel consumption, especially for more powerful, larger vessels. Of the formulated models, the best fit to training data were a GAM with a gear main effect and two smooth functions; standardized vessel length and engine power interacting with fuel price. For prediction, overall, this model showed the closest predictions with the least bias, followed by three linear models. However, all seven models compared for predictive capability performed well for the most sampled segments (demersal and pelagic trawlers). This is an author produced pre-print pdf.

40|$|The {{multiple}} mesh/single stage dynamics {{program is}} a gear tooth analysis program which determines detailed geometry, dynamic loads, stresses, and surface damage factors. The program can analyze a variety of both epicyclic and single mesh systems with spur or helical gear teeth including internal, external, and buttress tooth forms. The modifications refine the options for the flexible carrier and flexible ring gear rim and adds three options: a floating Sun gear option; a natural frequency option; and a finite element compliance formulation for helical gear teeth. The option for a floating Sun incorporates two additional degrees of freedom at the Sun center. The natural frequency option evaluates the frequencies of planetary, star, or differential systems {{as well as the}} effect of additional springs at the Sun center and those due to a flexible carrier and/or ring gear rim. The helical tooth pair finite element calculated compliance is obtained from an automated element breakup of the helical teeth and then is used with the basic gear dynamic solution and stress postprocessing routines. The flexible carrier or ring gear rim option for planetary and star spur gear systems allows the output torque per carrier and ring <b>gear</b> rim <b>segment</b> to vary based on the dynamic response of the entire system, while the total output torque remains constant...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} Stress and Reduction {{analysis of}} a Spur gear. Gears are commonly used for transmitting power. They develop high stress concentration at the root and the point of contact. The repeated stressing on the fillets causes the fatigue failure of gear tooth. The main objective {{of this study is}} to add different shaped holes to reduce stress concentration. A finite element model of Spur <b>gear</b> with a <b>segment</b> of three teeth is considered for analysis and stress concentration reducing holes of various sizes are introduced on gear teeth at various locations. In the paper Static {{analysis of a}} 3 -D model had been performed by using ANSYS 10. 0. Analysis revealed that aero-fin shaped hole introduced along the stress flow direction yielded better results. Finally Stress relieving feature having a shape of aero-fin is used in the path of stress flow which helped to regulate stress flow by redistributing the lines of force. This also yielded better results when compared to elliptical and circular holes. In this study, the best result is obtained by introducing aero-fin hole at (38. 7653, 65. 4083, and 0) and having scaling factor of 0. 6. The result displayed a stress reduction by 50. 23 % and displacement reduction by 45. 34 %...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{groups who}} are most likely to be vulnerable to new social risks and tests the effects of social policies on their poverty levels. Specifically, the paper conducts multi-level regression analyses across 18 OECD countries near the year 2004, analyzing the effects of social policies on the likelihood of being poor of low-skilled young women and men aged 18 - 30, and of those at risk of possessing obsolete skills, namely low-educated men aged 55 - 64. The analyses are conducted by combining both macro-level policy data and household-and person-level micro-data from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) cross-national database. The central question asks which policies - active labor market policies (ALMP), passive labor market policies (PLMP), employment protection legislation (EPL), family policies, government daycare spending - are effective at combating new social risks. In addition to analyzing social policies, the paper also considers union density and representation of women in national parliaments as two measures that depict agents who are most intent on combating old and new social risks, respectively. The findings show that active labor market policies (ALMP) are the most important predictor of a decrease in poverty levels among the low skilled. The negative effect of passive labor market policies (PLMP) on poverty is only significant for the older male group. Family policies are related to a reduction in poverty for both low-skilled young women and men. Union density is significant in reducing the odds of poverty of the older male group, while it is insignificant for both younger males and females - thereby reflecting a measure of prevention against old, but not new, social risks. Additionally, the paper's findings support the hypothesis that the greater the representation of women in national parliaments, the greater the chances of having policies that are associated with a reduction of poverty across age levels. Lastly, gross public social spending as a measure of overall welfare generosity is found to be associated with a reduction in poverty only of the older male group, but not that of the younger groups. The paper's analyses suggest that some social policies remain <b>geared</b> toward older <b>segments</b> of society, leaving the younger population at greater financial and therefore social risk...|$|R
