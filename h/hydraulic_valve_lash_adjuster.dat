In 1983-1985 a new DOHC engine {{replaced the}} SOHC engine used from 1979-1982. The new engine had <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> <b>lash</b> adjusters and was rubber mounted.

5000|$|The {{original}} Suzuki VL 1500 Intruder LC had a 26.7 in {{seat height}} and an underseat [...] fuel tank. Its new engine {{is designed to}} produce a claimed [...] @ 4,800 rpm, and 114 Nm @ 2,300 rpm torque. In 2004, Suzuki added a four-way emergency flasher/high beam passing switch, multi-reflector turn signals, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> <b>lash</b> adjusters, <b>hydraulic</b> clutch and a back-torque limiter.|$|R
5000|$|The Coyote {{features}} all new 4V DOHC {{cylinder heads}} that have shifted the camshafts outboard, which {{allowed for a}} compact roller finger follower setup with remote <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> <b>lash</b> adjusters and improved (raised) intake port geometry. The result is an intake port that outflows the Ford GT intake port by 4 percent and the Yates D3 (NASCAR) intake port up to 0.472" [...] (12 mm) lift, which is the maximum lift of the Coyote's intake cams. Engine redline is 7000 rpm.|$|R
50|$|Some engine {{variants}} have an intercooler {{in addition}} to the turbocharger, they can be identified by the tds. The M51 is an engine made of cast iron, it has one chain driven overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder. Compared to the M21 the M51 has now tappets and a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> <b>lash</b> adjustment. The fuel injection in the first engines is controlled by the ECU Bosch DDE 2.1, which was replaced after the first technical revision by the DDE 2.2. This results in greater torque at lower revs. For lubrication SAE 5W-40 oil is used.|$|R
25|$|All Swifts (export models) got a {{redesigned}} {{front and}} rear fascia {{as well as a}} new dashboard. GS sedans received power steering and new hub caps. The 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine received a new cylinder head assembly: the engine of the previous generation used the same block and corresponding components but featured a head with valves in a V-formation straddling a single camshaft with rocker arms on shafts, whereas now the cylinder head assumed a much slimmer profile, owing to the valves now being in a vertical, inline configuration, actuated by inverted buckets also serving as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> <b>lash</b> adjusters, all underneath a single overhead camshaft.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic lifters: Although RPM {{capability}} {{is limited by}} the use of <b>hydraulic</b> lifters, the <b>valve</b> <b>lash</b> is self-adjusting for the lifetime of the engine, reducing a significant maintenance requirement. Some OHC engines also use hydraulic lifters/lash adjusters. But the implementation is more complex in OHC designs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{desmodromic}} system avoids this problem, {{because it}} does not have to overcome the static energy of the spring. It must work against the momentum of the valve opening and closing, and that force still depends on the effective mass of the moving parts. The effective mass of a traditional valve with spring includes one-half of the valve spring mass and all of the valve spring retainer mass. However, a desmodromic system must deal with the inertia of the two rocker arms per valve, so this advantage depends greatly on the skill of the designer. Another disadvantage is the contact point between the cams and rocker arms. It is relatively easy to use roller tappets in conventional valvetrains, although it does add considerable moving mass. In a desmodromic system the roller would be needed {{at one end of the}} rocker arm, which would greatly increase its moment-of-inertia and negate its [...] "effective mass" [...] advantage. Thus, desmo systems have generally needed to deal with sliding friction between the cam and rocker arm and therefore may have greater wear. The contact points on most Ducati rocker arms are hard-chromed to reduce this wear. Another possible disadvantage is that it would be very difficult to incorporate <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> <b>lash</b> adjusters in a desmodromic system, so the valves must be periodically adjusted, but this is true of typical performance oriented motorcycles as <b>valve</b> <b>lash</b> is typically set using a shim under a cam follower.|$|R
50|$|Tools {{and owner}} {{servicing}} were well thought out. The R65 came standard {{with a full}} tool kit, {{as well as a}} hand-operated tire pump. Owner maintenance is standard practice with these machines. <b>Valve</b> <b>lash</b> was <b>adjusted</b> by a simple set screw-and-locknut arrangement, and timing was taken care of by adjustment of the points' housing. On later models (i.e., model year 1981 onward), the points were no longer used and a Hall sensor was placed inside the housing, this housing behind the front engine cover is colloquially known as the 'bean can'. Most other maintenance tasks were easily achieved due to easy access to most mechanicals.|$|R

40|$|Du graphe (P, V) de la {{compression}} d'un mélange gaz-liquide, on peut tirer la valeur du taux volumique de gaz dans le mélange. La vérification théorique et expérimentale de ce principe ainsi que ses limites d'application comme moyen de mesure sont présentées. Ce résultat a été utilisé pour développer un système de mesure de l'aération de l'huile moteur, le SMAC (Système de Mesure d'Aération par Compressibilité). Des exemples d'application, tels que l'étude de la sensibilité de certaines huiles à l'aération, sont exposés. Oil aeration {{can be a}} {{real problem}} in engine oil circuit. The involved lubrication power decrease and thermic properties changes can damage the engine. Furthermore, the increased compressibility is very dangerous for <b>hydraulic</b> systems like <b>valve</b> <b>lash</b> adjusters. A first step to control this aeration {{is to be able to}} measure it. Gammametry is often used but this measurement needs a very precise calibration and is quite complicated and dangerous. A new absolute measurement has been discovered, based on the difference of compressibility between air and oil. It is absolute because the measurement principle is independant of the conditions, The system does not need a new calibration at each new environment. It is valid for any gas-liquid mixture. From the (P, V) graph of a gas-liquid mixture compression, one can derive the gas-liquid volumetric ratio. The log-log graph (P/PO, 1 -V/VO) of a mixture sample pressurization always shows an inflexion point. The y value of this inflexion point (1 -V/VO) is equal to the volumetric gas ratio of the sample (before compression). This phenomenon is obvious on hydraulic curves (see Annexe 1). To check it, we have proceeded to a theoretical demonstration and an experimental verification. The theoretical demonstration of this principle concludes that the principle is verified as long as the ration P index 0 / alpha B is small. B is the oil bulk modulus, alpha is the volumetric gas ratio and P index 0 the sample initial pressure. Numerical simulations indicate that the pressurization must be regular and fast enough to avoid the problems coming from dissolution. They also indicate that small leakage could be profitable by decreasing the maximum pressure needed to meet the inflexion without modifying the measurement. The experimental verification consists in measuring the (P,V) graphs during the pressurization of different known mixture samples. The positions of the inflexion points of the log log graphs were compared with the known volumetric gas ratio. The correlation is very good and the deviations were inside the error range of the preparation of the mixture samples. Based on this principle, a system of oil aeration measurement has been developped : the SMAC (french name for Compressibility based oil Aeration Measurement System). The system is able to take samples from a given circuit by electrovalves. The sample is then regularly pressurized by a piston; pressure, piston displacement and temperature are stored along the time in a PC. The inflexion point is then determined, the gas ratio calculated and printed by a soft on the PC. The whole operation takes around three minutes. This apparatus has been used for two studies. The first one was dealing with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> <b>lash</b> adhusters (HLA). The SMAC was measuring the gas ratio of oil in the circuit. The aim was to evaluate the influence of aeration on the HLA. The second study consists in defining a new oil aeration test method to measure the influence of silicone additives on aeration. Generally speaking, the SMAC principle can be used on almost any gas liquid mixture to measure the volumetric gas ration...|$|R
50|$|A <b>{{hydraulic}}</b> <b>valve</b> lifter, {{also known}} as a hydraulic tappet or a hydraulic <b>lash</b> <b>adjuster,</b> is a device for maintaining zero valve clearance in an internal combustion engine. Conventional solid valve lifters require regular adjusting to maintain a small clearance between the valve and its rocker or cam follower. This space prevents the parts from binding as they expand with the engine's heat, but can also lead to noisy operation and increased wear as the parts rattle against one another until they reach operating temperature. The hydraulic lifter was designed to compensate for this small tolerance, allowing the valve train to operate with zero clearance—leading to quieter operation, longer engine life, and eliminating the need for periodic adjustment of valve clearance.|$|R
25|$|The rockers or cam {{followers}} sometimes incorporate {{a mechanism to}} <b>adjust</b> the <b>valve</b> <b>lash</b> through manual adjustment, but most modern auto engines have hydraulic lifters, eliminating the need to <b>adjust</b> the <b>valve</b> <b>lash</b> at regular intervals as the valvetrain wears, in particular the valves and valve seats in the combustion chamber.|$|R
5000|$|All 645 {{engines are}} {{two-stroke}} 45-degree V-engines. Each cylinder is of 645 cuin L displacement, hence the name; with a bore of 9+1/16 in, {{a stroke of}} 10 in and a compression ratio of 14.5:1. The engine is a uniflow design with four poppet-type exhaust valves in the cylinder head and charge air scavenging ports within {{the sides of the}} cylinders. All engines use a single overhead camshaft per bank, with exhaust valves operated by two cam lobes (each of which operates two exhaust valves through a [...] "bridge") and one cam lobe to operate the Unit injector which is {{in the center of the}} four exhaust valves. Rocker arms are roller-equipped to eliminate friction while <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> actuators are used to eliminate <b>valve</b> <b>lash.</b> Post-1995 710 engines employ Electronic Unit injectors, however these injectors still utilize a camshaft-actuated piston pump, as on non-EFI injectors.|$|R

50|$|The 12-valve (2 valves per cylinder) DOHC 5M-GE is {{familiar}} as {{the engine of}} the Toyota Supra and Toyota Cressida of the 1980s. It was quite different from any previous member of the M family, with Bosch L Jetronic-derived electronic fuel injection (using an AFM intake measuring scheme), wide-angle valves, and belt-driven dual camshafts. It used <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> lifters, a first for Toyota. The use of rocker arms and <b>valve</b> <b>lash</b> adjusters eliminated the need for valve clearance maintenance, a world first for any twin cam engine. This version of the M made its US debut in 1982's Toyota Celica Supra MK2. The 1982 version had a vacuum-advance distributor, whereas the 1983-1988 versions found in the Celica Supra and Cressida had full electronic control of the ignition system and distributor. The newer engine control system found in these later cars was named TCCS, or Toyota Computer Control System and, together with different intake runners, increased max power by 5 PS from August 1983.|$|R
