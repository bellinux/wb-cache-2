5|$|Andy assembles three applicants: a {{bodybuilder}} from Oscar Martinez's (Oscar Nunez) gym, Dwight's building handyman Nate (Mark Proksch), and a PhD {{candidate who}} can only work {{two days a}} week. Darryl demands anew to be fired, then switches gears: he tells Andy {{to give him the}} manager job, saying he deserves it and wants that or a pink slip. Andy then steps up and bluntly tells Darryl he not only <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that, but Darryl was not even the runner-up to Andy in the selection process. As he brings up Darryl's short temper, his hiring of the unqualified Glenn, and his loss of interest in taking business education courses, Darryl finally snaps out of his funk and listens to him. Andy tells Darryl that Jo Bennett loved him and saw something in him, and he simply stopped striving after that. He convinces Darryl to stay on board, and Darryl says he will assemble a new warehouse staff using a combination of his picks and one or two of Andy's applicants.|$|E
500|$|While flirting, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) reveals he {{is ready}} to propose to Pam, even going as far as telling her that he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it at work ("because that would be rather lame") and when he does it, it will [...] "kick her ass". Pam is not sure if he's joking. Alone with the camera, Jim reveals that he was not joking and shows an {{engagement}} ring that he bought [...] "the week after [...] started dating." [...] After work, while walking back to his car, he stops and gets down on one knee. When Pam stops and looks he says he has a question to ask her. After a second or so of hesitation, he asks her if she will wait while he ties his shoes. She laughs and they continue walking hand in hand. [...] At the end of the episode, Michael and Dwight are seen singing [...] "American Pie" [...] and dancing in the same cemetery at night, presumably having never left.|$|E
2500|$|Following the 2008 South Ossetia War, and Russian {{recognition}} of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Tadić refused to follow suit, saying {{that even though}} he respects the Russian support to Serbia regarding Kosovo, [...] "Serbia {{is not going to}} recognise these so-called new countries". He stated that [...] "Serbia <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something that is against our interest, because we are defending out territorial integrity and sovereignty by using international law" [...] and that by constitution he must defend the interests of Serbia, and not the interests of {{any other country in the}} world.|$|E
6000|$|... "And you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> French, and sceptical, and sneering? You <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{think it}} {{a sign of}} wisdom to refuse to admire?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Lady Bellamy, I <b>am.</b> I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stand being bullied and jeered at by {{that damned}} scoundrel Caresfoot any more. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stand your eternal visits to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The same in effect. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{attend to}} {{nonsensical}} gossip. Georgina {{is what she}} was then, {{and the same is}} right for me now as was right last year. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> turn against her--' ...|$|R
2500|$|In this story, Kingston {{reveals that}} her mother cut the {{membrane}} under her tongue. Kingston despises a Chinese girl who is {{a year older than}} she is because she refuses to talk. [...] One day, she finds herself alone with the girl in the lavatory. Kingston writes about other eccentric stories. After Kingston screams to her mother and father that she {{does not want to be}} set up with the developmentally disabled boy, she launches into a laundry list of things she is and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> regardless of her mother’s opinion. In the final part, Kingston tells the story of Ts’ai Yen, a poet born in A.D. 175.|$|E
2500|$|Toronto {{lost their}} home opener July 11 versus Saskatchewan by {{a score of}} 46–36. The Argonauts {{committed}} 12 penalties for 124yards, 109yards of which were in the first half. The Argonauts opened the game strongly by scoring a touchdown on their opening drive and scoring a field goal after blocking a Luca Congi field goal try to take an early 10–0 lead. Toronto penalties assisted a Saskatchewan drive for a touchdown to make it 10–7. Then, Toronto kicker Justin Medlock made another field goal to end the first quarter with a 13–7 lead. In the second quarter, Toronto allowed Saskatchewan to score thirty unanswered points. Toronto came {{back in the second}} half scoring three touchdowns and a field goal and holding Saskatchewan to three field goals but ended up losing by 10. After the game, an angry coach Andrus said that players needed to control the penalties. Adriano Belli in particular, who took 4 penalties for 44yards in the first half including a head butt that continued the Roughriders first drive for a touchdown, took some criticism: [...] "If he wants to be a WWE wrestler, then he can go do that, but he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> on my football team", said Andrus.|$|E
6000|$|... "If your mamma {{is afraid}} that Fred {{will make me}} an offer, tell her that I would not marry him if he asked me. But he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, that I am aware. He {{certainly}} never has asked me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kill me?" [...] she moaned, {{turning up}} her ghastly face. [...] "I can't die. I'm afraid to die. It will hurt, and I've been wicked. Oh, you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kill me, <b>are</b> you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Again {{something}} {{written before}} Tommy {{had actually been}} formed as a total idea, and that particular song wasn't about Tommy's devotees at all. It was about the rabble in general, how we, myself as part of them, <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take fascism, <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take dreary, dying politics; <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take {{things the way they}} were, the way they always had been and that we were keen to change things."

6000|$|Why {{should she}} give her {{allegiance}} to this world, {{and let it}} so dominate her, that her own world of warm sun and growing, sap-filled life was turned into nothing? She <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do it. She <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a prisoner in the dry, tyrannical man-world. She <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> care about it. What did it matter if her class did ever so badly in the quarterly examination. Let it--what did it matter? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess we'll {{lock them}} in the back store until morning," [...] he said, after a short conference apart with Grant. [...] "A little cooling down <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> them much harm, and I don't think anyone could get out without an axe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Darlington <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything. My brother {{paid the}} bill at last. George doesn't {{speak to me}} either.... I don't care," [...] he added, with a sigh. [...] "As long as one has this stuff, one doesn't want friends. I think I have had too many friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{you must}} beware of the refined {{selfishness}} which shrinks from righteous self-assertion because it is painful. You must make sure of your real motive; you must consider whether your sacrifice <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more harm than good. But why do you come to me with your trouble? Why don't {{you go to your}} father--your mother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be afraid," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ask you any questions. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ask for any explanations. I {{think that}} we have passed all that. It is of the future I wanted to speak." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My {{father is}} {{angry at the}} present time," [...] said Bertie, looking up for a moment from his sketches, [...] "because I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> marry Mrs. Bold. What can I say on the matter? It is true that I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> marry her. In the first place--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have such}} a clever way of putting things that I don't know how to {{contradict}} you, though I still think I'm right," [...] she said gravely. [...] "Mac likes to idle as well as you, but he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it because he knows it's bad for him to fritter away his time. He is going to study a profession like a wise boy, though he would much prefer to live among his beloved books or ride his hobbies in peace." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{are going}} to stay here at least a week. We shall not try to do {{everything}} that can be done on Scottish soil, for we shall not stalk stags or shoot grouse; and I have told Jone that he may put on as many Scotch bonnets and plaids as he likes, but there is one thing he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and that is to go bare-kneed, to which he answered, he would never do that unless he could dip his knees into weak coffee so that they would be the same color as his face.|$|E
6000|$|The {{highest class}} white men who lived among the Maoris in the {{earliest}} time had a high opinion of them and a strong affection for them. Among the whites of this sort {{was the author of}} [...] "Old New Zealand;" [...] and Dr. Campbell of Auckland was another. Dr. Campbell was a close friend of several chiefs, and has many pleasant things to say of their fidelity, their magnanimity, and their generosity. Also of their quaint notions about the white man's queer civilization, and their equally quaint comments upon it. One of them thought the missionary had got everything wrong end first and upside down. [...] "Why, he wants us to stop worshiping and supplicating the evil gods, and go to worshiping and supplicating the Good One! There is no sense in that. A good god <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> us any harm." ...|$|E
6000|$|I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{give any}} examples.

6000|$|... 'You <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try any detective work; to {{find out}} if she is a woman with a past, with a husband living?

5000|$|On September 10, 2015, the Oath Keepers {{announced}} that they would travel to Rowan County, Kentucky to prevent Kim Davis from being arrested and jailed should she be held in contempt a second time for violating a court order prohibiting her from interfering with marriage licensing in her office. The group aimed to block enforcement of contempt of court rulings against Davis, and said, [...] "If the sheriff, who should be interceding, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his job and the governor <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the governor's job of interceding, then we'll do it."

50|$|Near {{the end of}} the day, one of Pam's {{friends from}} art school, Alex (Rich Sommer), comes to visit Pam at the {{corporate}} office. He pulls her into the conference room and tells her he thinks that she should not move back to Scranton. Jim, still listening on the Bluetooth, jokes that Alex has a crush on her, but then Alex tells her that if she really wants to pursue a career in art, then only three months in New York <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> any good for her.

50|$|Liz tells Mary Jane she {{suspects}} Flash has a {{crush on}} somebody else. During a school football game Liz loses it and attacks an opposing cheerleader who was talking to Flash. After the incident, Mary Jane tells Liz, who still does not know that Mary Jane is the one Flash has {{a crush on}}, she will talk to Flash. After the game, Mary Jane waits for Flash at his home and returns his notebook, telling him that she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything about his crush on her and that, contrary to what he might assume due to her constant insults, Liz really loves him. However, as Liz, {{who was going to}} apologize to Flash for her previous behavior, sees the two together in front of Flash's house, she suspects Flash is having an affair with Mary Jane.|$|E
50|$|Ruby and Runa are twins, {{although}} one, {{unbeknownst to}} both, was adopted, and are one {{the opposite of}} the other: Ruby is responsible, obedient and kind, while Runa is manipulative, selfish and greedy. When Ruby announces her engagement to Bae Kyung-min, the jealousy Runa harbors for her sister sharpens: it has always been her dream to marry a rich man, but instead she remained pregnant with her boyfriend Na In-soo. Soon after, the two sisters have a car accident which disfigurs them. Since Ruby's engagement ring and clothes are found on Runa, doctors reconstruct their faces swapping them. Runa has now the opportunity to live as Ruby, who, when she wakes up from a coma and discovers what her sister is doing and that In-soo, while knowing the truth, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything, plans revenge.|$|E
