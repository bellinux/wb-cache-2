40|$|Although {{territorial}} <b>disputes</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} fraught issues among states, how public opinion on territorial <b>disputes</b> varies within states and what explains the variation are often overlooked. This paper argues that citizens who prioritize economic considerations are more likely to support compromises over such <b>disputes,</b> while those who prioritize a country’s reputation tend to reject any compromise. Further, the paper hypothesizes that such variation in individual preferences can be explained by proximity to <b>disputed</b> territories. Counterintuitively, residents closer to <b>disputes</b> are more likely to support a compromise than those who live further away, because they are more affected by economic considerations. Those far from the <b>disputed</b> territory can afford to focus on its political aspects, which leads to a more hawkish stance. By using an experimental approach within Japan, this paper examines the validity of the spatial argument, and tests the relative salience of economic and political aspects of territorial <b>disputes.</b> The findings, based on original survey data, show that distance from <b>disputed</b> territories shapes individual preferences, and under some conditions, people living further away from <b>disputed</b> territories are more hawkish...|$|R
