5|$|In 1899, Hartford City Glass was {{acquired}} by the American Window Glass Company, which controlled 85 percent of the American window glass manufacturing capacity. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade,</b> the company began replacing its skilled and well–paid Belgian glass blowers with machines and less-skilled machine operators. The company used the Hartford City plant to test and refine the new technology. Most of the Belgian glass workers left town.|$|E
5|$|Kaegi {{discovered}} Pierre Schaeffer, musique concrète and the GRM {{radio broadcasts}} in Paris in 1951, yet his 1950s compositions are for traditional instruments; Ariadne in Zürich is for clarinet and piano 4 hands, Miniaturen, for oboe, bassoon and cimbalom, while the 1956 Sonate is for clarinet and piano. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade,</b> however, Werner Kaegi embraced electronic music {{and became a}} pioneer of Swiss electroacoustic music, predating other composers in the field, such as Bruno Spoerri and Rainer Boesch.|$|E

25|$|In {{the middle}} 60s, with the {{collaboration}} of Standard Oil and ESSO-Pappas, a large industrial zone was created, containing refineries, oil refinery and steel production.

5|$|In 1893, Rush {{moved his}} family to Sydney. The Banks Crash reduced many Australian {{businessmen}} to ruin, Rush included. His business was built on credit alone: Rush did not even own the Grafton house {{where he and his}} family lived, having mortgaged it from the man who sold it to him. He borrowed from local banks, using his store-keeping business as security. In Sydney, Rush took a lease on the York Hotel, at the corner of King and York Streets, which quickly became known as 'Mick Rush's Hotel', a popular venue for meetings of sportsmen. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade,</b> Rush kept several hotels in the city of Sydney, and operated also as a hotel broker.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few people}} visited the cave <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade.</b> Among them was Thomas Condon, {{professor}} of geology at the University of Oregon. Guided by Davidson's brother, in 1884 he {{and a group of}} students hiked from Williams to the cavern, which they inspected by candlelight. Shortly thereafter, Walter Burch, an acquaintance of the Davidson family, tried to develop the cave as a business. Burch and his partners opened what they called Limestone Caves and charged visitors $1 each for a guided cave trip, a camping spot, pasture for horses, and cave water they described as medicinal. Although Burch and others hacked crude trails to the cave from Cave Junction and Williams, the trip was too difficult for most tourists, and Limestone Caves ceased operations in 1888.|$|E
5|$|Otto, {{who was a}} {{grandson}} of BélaIV of Hungary, was crowned king, but only the Kőszegis and the Transylvanian Saxons regarded him as the lawful monarch. He was captured in Transylvania by Ladislaus Kán, who forced him to leave Hungary. The majority of the lords and prelates elected Charles Robert king at a Diet on October10, 1307. He was crowned king with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Székesfehérvár by the Archbishop of Esztergom, as required by customary law, on August27, 1310. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade,</b> he launched a series of military campaigns against the oligarchs to restore royal authority. Charles Robert reunited the kingdom {{after the death of}} the most powerful lord, Mattheus Csák, which enabled him to conquer Csák's large province in the northeast of Hungary in 1321.|$|E
50|$|The first {{changes were}} {{noted in the}} early 19th century. Until then 350 people visited the worship in average. This number reduced <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decades</b> (1938: 100 people) to the present-day level of 70 (1990s). Likewise the {{percentage}} of Protestant interest in the whole population decreased from 91% to 61%.|$|R

25|$|Achievements. As {{a result}} of massive {{externally}} funded investments access to {{water supply and sanitation}} increased substantially <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decades.</b> For example, water production capacity increased from 5.5 million cubic meters per day in 1982 to 21 million in 2004 and per capita water consumption increased from 130 to 275 liter per day <b>during</b> <b>the</b> same period.|$|R
5|$|Part of {{this scheme}} was the {{announcement}} of sharply increased freight charges. This touched off a firestorm of protest from independent oil well owners, including boycotts and vandalism, {{which led to the}} discovery of Standard Oil's part in the deal. A major New York refiner, Charles Pratt and Company, headed by Charles Pratt and Henry H. Rogers, led the opposition to this plan, and railroads soon backed off. Pennsylvania revoked the cartel's charter, and non-preferential rates were restored for the time being. While competitors may have been unhappy, Rockefeller's efforts did bring American consumers cheaper kerosene and other oil by-products. Before 1870, oil light was only for the wealthy, provided by expensive whale oil. But <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade,</b> kerosene became commonly available to the working and middle classes.|$|E
5|$|Charles won {{his first}} decisive victory in the Battle of Rozgony (at present-day Rozhanovce in Slovakia) on 15June 1312. After that his troops seized most fortresses of the {{powerful}} Aba family. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade,</b> Charles restored royal power primarily {{with the assistance of}} the prelates and lesser noblemen in most regions of the kingdom. After the death of the most powerful oligarch, Matthew Csák, in 1321, Charles became the undisputed ruler of the whole kingdom, with the exception of Croatia where local noblemen were able to preserve their autonomous status. He was not able to hinder the development of Wallachia into an independent principality after his defeat in the Battle of Posada in 1330. Charles's contemporaries described his defeat in that battle as a punishment from God for his cruel revenge against the family of Felician Záh who had attempted to slaughter the royal family.|$|E
5|$|Haiti had won its {{independence}} from France in 1804, the first Caribbean nation to do so. The Haitians had fought a lengthy and bloody war against the French known as the Haitian Revolution, in which armies of former slaves led by Toussaint Louverture and then Jean-Jacques Dessalines succeeded in driving the French into their fortified ports and then systematically eliminating their enclaves. With {{the start of the}} Napoleonic Wars in 1803, French reinforcements for the garrison on Haiti were delayed and intercepted by the British Royal Navy, who blockaded the island and took the surrenders of the last garrisons in 1804, removing them and their dependents to prevent a massacre. Dessalines rapidly established himself as monarch of Haiti, but his reign was cut short in 1806 when his closest advisors, Henri Christophe and Alexandre Pétion organised his assassination. Assuming control of Haiti, Christophe laid claim to {{the northern part of the}} country and Pétion the south, the two sides waging a constant low-level civil war <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade.</b> Many minor rulers sprang up during this period, especially in the south, where Pétion gave parcels of land for his followers to establish their own private fiefdoms. One such warlord was Jérôme Maximilien Borgella, who took over command of a small state in the region of Léogane following the death of its ruler, André Rigaud.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> {{enlargement}} {{was triggered}} by refugees of World War II. Many of them removed later further to the west.
