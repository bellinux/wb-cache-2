5|$|Inland Empire is a 2006 mystery film. The film stars Laura Dern, Justin Theroux, Harry Dean Stanton, Grace Zabriskie, Jeremy Irons and Diane Ladd. While remaking a Polish {{film that}} was {{abandoned}} after a mysterious tragedy, an actress finds herself falling for a fellow cast member and realises {{that her life}} <b>is</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> echo the plot of their production.|$|E
5|$|The film brings {{together}} the video diaries recorded by four friends and {{students at the}} Tariq bin Ziad High School for Boys in Zayouna, a mixed-race, middle-class area in the Karrada suburb of Baghdad, Iraq. Entering their final year in 2006, each has high expectations for the year ahead and hope to graduate so {{they can have a}} chance to attend university. At the same time, the boys must also deal with the increasing sectarian violence that <b>is</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> extend into Karrada. They face the threats of roadside bombings, the hassles of security checkpoints on their way to school, frequent curfews, the constant presence of American Apache helicopters overhead, and the deterioration of their neighbourhood which becomes rife with assassinations, muggings and kidnappings. Many of their fellow students, unmotivated and academically underperforming, are absent from school.|$|E

5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray {{is closely}} related to H. undulata and H. leoparda, which share much of its range. All three species are very similar in size, shape, and color pattern, resulting in a long history of taxonomic confusion that only recently <b>is</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> be untangled. In 2004, Mabel Manjaji described the 'uarnak' species complex, containing H. fai, H. gerrardi, H. jenkinsii, H. leoparda, H. toshi, H. uarnak, and H. undulata, plus three more undescribed species. The reticulate whipray itself varies in appearance throughout its range, and further taxonomic comparisons are required to determine whether its spotted and reticulated color morphs in fact represent different species. Alternate common names for this ray include coachwhip ray, leopard stingray, longtail stingray, and marbled stingray; some of these names are shared by other, similar species.|$|E
5|$|Diamond is hard, {{chemically}} inert, and {{has high}} thermal conductivity {{and a low}} coefficient of thermal expansion. These properties make diamond superior to any other existing window material used for transmitting infrared and microwave radiation. Therefore, synthetic diamond <b>is</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> replace zinc selenide as the output window of high-power CO2 lasers and gyrotrons. Those synthetic polycrystalline diamond windows are shaped as disks of large diameters (about 10cm for gyrotrons) and small thicknesses (to reduce absorption) and can only be produced with the CVD technique. Single crystal slabs of dimensions of length up to approximately 10mm are becoming increasingly important in several areas of optics including heatspreaders inside laser cavities, diffractive optics and as the optical gain medium in Raman lasers. Recent advances in the HPHT and CVD synthesis techniques have improved the purity and crystallographic structure perfection of single-crystalline diamond enough to replace silicon as a diffraction grating and window material in high-power radiation sources, such as synchrotrons. Both the CVD and HPHT processes are also used to create designer optically transparent diamond anvils {{as a tool for}} measuring electric and magnetic properties of materials at ultra high pressures using a diamond anvil cell.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a mysteriously ill Jordan {{continues}} {{to ask about}} Helen's whereabouts, and her remarks about Helen's conditions lead Black to believe she <b>is</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> experience the seemingly-psychic visions {{he is capable of}} seeing, which allow him to see the evil people are capable of. Elsewhere, Green is arrested. His property is searched but Helen is nowhere to be found—although another corpse is dug up in the garden, evidently killed nine years before. Black deduces that Green could not have killed Helen at the cabin as his house was already being watched by the police. He sees a set of tools in Green's home which he realizes were not used for murder or torture, but to immure Helen in the basement. Black and the police dismantle a newly finished plaster wall, finding Helen injured but alive; it is at this point that Black realizes Green was simply a pawn, used by his father to lure victims to the house.|$|E

25|$|Although it is {{a country}} of high annual rainfall, {{irrigation}} in Vietnam is widespread. The reason is the uneven distribution of rainwater in space and in time. Irrigation management is mainly dominated by the state whereas there have been certain reforms leading to change during the last years. Awareness rising concerning environmental issues <b>is</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> reach the people in Vietnam as well. Different strategies have been developed within the last decade to deal with environmental problems and mitigate possible impacts of climate change.
