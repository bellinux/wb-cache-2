25|$|Since 2006, SDC {{has been}} cold stacked off Herschel Island, Canada. , the mothballed rig {{is the last}} {{remaining}} <b>drilling</b> <b>unit</b> built for oil exploration in the Beaufort sea in the 1980s. The two other bottom-founded units, Glomar Beaufort 1 and Molikpaq, have been converted to production platforms in Sakhalin, Russia, and the floating conical <b>drilling</b> <b>unit</b> Kulluk was scrapped after drifting aground off Sitkalidak Island in the Gulf of Alaska in 2012.|$|E
25|$|On 31 October 2013, a Shell {{representative}} {{hinted that}} Kulluk {{may not be}} brought back into operation. On 27 February 2014, Kulluk was again loaded on Xiang Rui Kou which carried the mobile <b>drilling</b> <b>unit</b> to a Chinese scrapyard.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar), the {{drilling}} subsidiary of Dome Petroleum, purchased World Saga {{with the intention}} of converting the oil tanker to an ice-resistant mobile offshore <b>drilling</b> <b>unit</b> that could continue exploratory drilling operations in the Beaufort Sea beyond the short open-water season. Previously, the company had utilized drillships that had been winterized for arctic conditions, but existing mooring and dynamic positioning systems could not keep the vessel in place in moving first-year ice. This limited station-keeping ability shortened the drilling season in the Beaufort Sea to about 100 days which was not sufficient to drill and test a typical well within one summer season. An alternative approach was to use artificial islands, either dredged islands with gradually sloping sides or sand-filled concrete structures resting on a subsea gravel berm. While caisson-retained islands were considered to be the most appropriate and cost-effective way to extend the drilling season in the Beaufort Sea, relocating them was time-consuming and expensive as the structure had to be completely reconstructed every time it was moved to a new drilling location. The new <b>drilling</b> <b>unit</b> was intended to overcome these limitations.|$|E

25|$|Between 1983 and 1990, BeauDril's mobile {{drilling}} units drilled a {{total of}} nineteen exploratory wells in the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea {{with the support of}} Ikaluk and other icebreaking vessels: nine with the Mobile Arctic Caisson Molikpaq and ten with the Conical <b>Drilling</b> <b>Unit</b> Kulluk. Twelve wells alone were drilled in the Amauligak prospect, the most significant oil and gas field discovered in the region, but the high expections for the Beaufort Sea were not met: the area was characterized by a large number of small, widely scattered resources. Molikpaq was mothballed after completing the last well in 1990. However, Kulluk was used to drill {{a total of}} four wells in 1992 and 1993 for ARCO Alaska on the American part of the Beaufort Sea before being cold-stacked at Tuktoyaktuk.|$|E

2500|$|On 27 December 2012, while Aiviq was towing {{the mobile}} {{offshore}} <b>drilling</b> <b>unit</b> Kulluk {{off the coast}} of Kodiak Island, Alaska, the towing line between the icebreaker and the drilling rig parted due to a mechanical failure of the towing shackle.

In the following morning, power was successfully restored on one of the four main engines and the vessel was able to hold position in the heavy weather. United States Coast Guard cutter USCGC Alex Haley was dispatched to the scene to monitor the situation.

After the well was completed on 26 February 1992, SSDC was placed in long-term storage ("cold stacked") at Port Clarence, Alaska, where {{it would not be}} trapped in Beaufort Sea ice if work could be found elsewhere. The Cabot well was also the last one drilled by SSDC under Canadian ownership. In 1997, Amoco sold Canmar's former fleet of drilling units and offshore icebreakers to Norway-based Seatankers Ltd. The <b>drilling</b> <b>unit</b> was re-registered to Marshall Islands and its name was shortened to SDC. The submersible barge MAT was also renamed SDC II.|$|E
2500|$|Ten years later, SDC was recommissioned {{to drill}} an {{exploratory}} well for Encana Oil & Gas at the McCovey prospect off Alaska. After {{a month and}} a half of preparations, the rig was towed back to the Beaufort Sea in July 2002 by two icebreakers, Arctic Kalvik and Kigoria, which completed the [...] tow from Port Clarence in just 12 days. The preparations for the winter were stopped on 15 August for about two months to avoid disturbing the bowhead whaling season. Drilling of the well, located in only [...] of water, began on 6 December 2002 and was completed on 27 January 2003. With no immediate drilling work available for SDC, the rig was towed to Thetis Bay where it had previously been stored for two winters.
