40|$|It is {{reported}} that [Z. Huang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 204801 (2012) ], high-gain free-electron laser (FEL) {{can be generated}} by transverse-dispersed electron beams from laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs) using transverse-gradient undulator (TGU) assuming an ideal constant dispersion function without <b>focusing</b> <b>optics.</b> The constant dispersion function keeps electrons beyond the resonant energy bandwidth still being on resonant with the FEL radiation. Instead, in this paper, the case with <b>focusing</b> <b>optics</b> in an LPA-driven FEL using TGU is numerically studied, in which the dispersion function should be monotonously decreasing along the undulator. Even though the FEL resonance is not always satisfied for off-energy electrons in this case, through subtly optimizing the initial dispersion and focusing parameters, it is feasible to achieve a similar radiation power to the case assuming an ideal constant dispersion function without <b>focusing</b> <b>optics,</b> and meanwhile, to attain a good transverse coherence. Moreover, higher radiation power could be expected if longitudinally tapering, transverse-gradient variation in different sections are systematically conducted, which is demonstrated with intense global multiparameters optimizations based on GENESIS simulation...|$|R
