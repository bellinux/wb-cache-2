The {{oscillating}} motion of the cannonball was dynamically assimilated {{to that of a}} pendulum bob by imagining it to be attached to the end of an immensely cosmologically long cord suspended from the vault of the fixed stars centred on the Earth, whereby the relatively short arc of its path through the enormously distant Earth was practically a straight line along the tunnel. Real world pendula were then conceived of as just micro versions of this 'tunnel pendulum', the macro-cosmological paradigmatic dynamical model of the pendulum, but just with far shorter cords and with their bobs oscillating above the Earth's surface in arcs corresponding to the tunnel inasmuch as their oscillatory midpoint was dynamically assimilated to the centre of the tunnel as the centre of the Earth.|$|E

For here the analogy made with the gravitational tunnel experiment was that the tension in the string pulling it towards the normal played the role of gravity, and thus when plucked i.e. pulled away from the normal and then released, this was the equivalent of pulling the cannonball to the Earth's surface and then releasing it. Thus the musical string vibrated in a continual cycle of the alternating creation of impetus towards the normal and its destruction after passing through the normal until this process starts again with the creation of fresh 'downward' impetus once all the 'upward' impetus has been destroyed.|$|E

In 1897 Joseph Larmor developed a model in which all forces are considered to be of electromagnetic origin, and length contraction appeared to be a direct consequence of this model. Yet it was shown by Henri Poincaré (1905) that electromagnetic forces alone cannot explain the electron's stability.

50|$|CHM were {{introduced}} in the early '80s {{as an extension of}} technicolor theories to allow for the presence of a physical Higgs boson. At the time this was not required by the data but recent discoveries have shown the necessity of a physical Higgs doublet to break the electro-weak symmetry. This differs from ordinary technicolor theories where strong dynamics directly breaks the electro-weak symmetry without the need of a physical Higgs boson. The first CHM proposed by Georgi and Kaplan were based on known gauge theory dynamics that produces the Higgs doublet as a Goldstone boson. These models are very constrained {{and it is difficult to}} include fermion masses. The subject remained dormant for several years until it was realized that this type of models naturally arise in 5 dimensional theories known as Randall-Sundrum scenarios.

It was soon understood that these scenarios can also be realized in hypothetical strongly coupled conformal field theories (CFT) also providing a <b>dynamical</b> <b>explanation</b> for the generation of hierarchies. The connection between Randall-Sundrum models and CFTs is rooted in the AdS-CFT correspondence. This spurred a great deal of activity in the field.

The cloud top height in the GCM decreases from equator to pole and latitudinal gradients of cloud top height are comparable to those observed by Pioneer Venus and Venus Express, and those produced in more complex microphysical models of the sulfur cycle on Venus.

The (thermo) dynamics of these phenom-ena is still not completely understood and, nowadays, it still represents a major scientific challenge because mesocyclones and tornadoes high vortic-ity concentration often springs out from initial conditions characterized by low vorticity. Moreover, from the forecasting point of view, the predictabil-ity of these phenomena is still quite poor even if some phenomenological diagrams have been developed (e. g., CAPE-SHEAR diagrams) but their ef-fective forecasting realiability in different climatic areas is still a matter of debate,(among the wide literature [6] and [5]).

Dynamical system theory provides the framework for a unified treatment of these questions.;The main goal of this dissertation is to propose a new view of the aims and methods of cognitive science [...] the dynamical approach. According to this view, the object of cognitive science is a particular set of dynamical systems, which I call "cognitive systems". The goal of a cognitive study is to specify a dynamical model of a cognitive system, and then use this model to produce a detailed account of the specific cognitive abilities of that system. The dynamical approach does not limit a-priori the form of the dynamical models which cognitive science may consider. In particular, this approach is compatible with both computational and connectionist modeling, for both computational systems and connectionist networks are special types of dynamical systems.;To substantiate these methodological claims about cognitive science, I deal first with two questions in two different fields: What is a computational system?

40|$|The Bonin high is a {{subtropical}} anticyclone that is predominant near Japan in the summer. This anticyclone {{is associated with}} an equivalent-barotropic structure, often extending throughout the entire troposphere. Although the equivalent-barotropic structure of the Bonin high {{has been known for}} years among synopticians because of its importance to the summer climate in east Asia, there are few <b>dynamical</b> <b>explanations</b> for such a structure. The present paper attempts to provide a formation mechanism for the deep ridge near Japan. We propose a new hypothesis that this equivalent-barotropic ridge near Japan is formed {{as a result of the}} propagation of stationary Rossby waves along the Asian jet in the upper troposphere (‘the Silk Road pattern’). First, the monthly mean climatology is examined in order to demonstrate this hypothesis. It is shown that the enhanced Asian jet in August is favourable for the propagation of stationary Rossby waves and that the regions of descent over the eastern Mediterranean Sea and the Aral Sea act as two major wave sources. Second, a primitive-equation model is used to simulate the climatology of August. The model successfully simulates the Bonin high with an equivalent-barotropic structure. The upper-tropospheric ridge is found to be enhanced by a height anomaly of more than 80 m at 200 hPa, when a wave packet arrives. Sensitivity experiments are conducted to show that the removal of the diabatic cooling over the Asian jet suppresses the Silk Road pattern and formation of an equivalent-barotropic ridge near Japan, while the removal of the diabatic heating in the western Pacific does not.

Historically, ocean {{models and}} {{solutions}} of different complexity {{have been developed}} to investigate the dynamics of basin-scale, deep, meridional overturning circulations (MOCs). In this study, we develop a three-dimensional theory for the descending branch of the MOC in solutions {{near the bottom of the}} hierarchy, forced only by a surface buoyancy flux and a zonal wind stress. Our theory is based on analytical solutions for a variable-density, layer ocean model (VLOM). The results are validated by comparing the VLOM solutions to numerical solutions to an ocean general circulation model (MITgcm). Key processes that determine the strength and structure of the model MOC are the following. The eastern-boundary upper-layer thickness is determined by a no-flow condition normal to the boundary, which implies a poleward deepening of the thermocline in response to the meridional surface density gradient. The baroclinic Rossby-wave speed in VLOM illustrates how the large-scale surface density gradient aggects the propagation of Rossby waves, which adjust the interior-ocean layer thickness. In a narrow, northern region, the upper layer with a vertically uniform temperature is very thick, and Rossby waves are damped by mixing processes, which tend to restratify the water column. In solutions without winds, the Rossby-wave damping is the main mechanism to generate a northward convergence of upper-layer flow, and to establish the sinking branch of the MOC. In solutions with winds, water also detrains in the interior subpolar gyre, as it is cooled on its way north, and is finally reaches the deep-ocean temperature. We derive analytical expressions for MOC transports in VLOM that depend on the tropical thermocline depth, the meridional density gradient, the strength of the mixing and the wind forcing. These results recover and provide <b>dynamical</b> <b>explanations</b> for scaling laws that relate the strength of the MOC to the meridional pressure difference...|$|R
