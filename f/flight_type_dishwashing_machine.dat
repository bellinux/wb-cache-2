40|$|For {{commercial}} buildings {{there are four}} main types of water {{that need to be}} considered, these are potable water, greywater, blackwater and stormwater. Potable water is generally defined as 2 ̆ 7 water which is suitable for human consumption 2 ̆ 7 (Australian Standards, 2003) and is commonly referred to as drinking water. Greywater is the domestic wastewater from bathroom fixtures (such as basins, showers and baths), laundry fixtures (such as clothes washing machines and laundry troughs) and kitchen facilities (such as sinks and <b>dishwashing</b> <b>machines).</b> Depending on the level of wastewater treatment, greywater can be recovered and used for applications such as toilet flushing and irrigation. Blackwater refers to 2 ̆ 7 waste discharges from the human body 2 ̆ 7 (Australian Standards, 2000), which are collected through fixtures such as toilets, urinals and bidets. It is possible to use this wastewater for non-drinking purposes once treated and disinfected. Stormwater refers to run-off due to rainfall collected from roofs, impervious surfaces and drainage systems (Australian Standards, 2003). Stormwater collected from roofs (also referred to as rainwater) can be used untreated for applications such as wash-down, irrigation and toilet flushing.

A motor turned the wheel while hot soapy water squirted up from the bottom of the boiler and rained down on the dishes. Her dishwasher was the first to use water pressure instead of scrubbers to clean the dishes inside the machine.

40|$|Background: Shift work {{research}} has shown that the relationship between exposure to irregular working times and sickness absence may differ between working populations. Not much is known about the prevalence of sickness absence in flight crews or about the relationship between exposure to different flight schedules and sickness absence in this population. Aims: To examine the association between cumulative exposure to different <b>flight</b> <b>types</b> and sickness absence in flight crew members. Methods: The study population consisted of flight crew members from a 5 year historic cohort. Flight schedule and sickness absence data were obtained from company records. The association between the cumulative exposure to different <b>flight</b> <b>types</b> and sickness absence episodes of > 7 days was determined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Adjusted models were obtained by adding potential confounders. Previous sickness absence was added to compose the fully adjusted models. Results: The records of 8228 employees were analysed. The fully adjusted univariate analyses showed that the numbers of medium-haul flights and flights with time zone crossings were associated with an increase in the odds for sickness absence. The fully adjusted multivariate analyses showed no significant associations between <b>flight</b> <b>types</b> and sickness absence. Conclusions: Cumulative exposure to <b>flight</b> <b>types</b> was not independently associated with sickness absence in flight crew members when previous sickness absence was taken into account. Because sickness absence in the past can predict future absence, preventive strategies targeted at flight crew members with a history of high sickness absence may be effective...|$|R

40|$|An {{ambitious and}} novel {{approach}} to engineering design and sustainability {{has been taken}} to explore the potential of drawing parallels between mechanical and biological systems for the possible development of sustainable engineering design metrics using a thermodynamic model. This approach looks to biology. Natural selection has given biological beings and processes high exergetic efficiencies, even while being only 30 - 40 % energy efficient on the cell level. This energy inefficiency, resulting in a release of heat, can then be used to aid in driving other biochemical processes. The Gibbs free energy becomes more negative proportionally {{with an increase in}} temperature, resulting in a more favorable reaction. This effective use of waste heat from cell processes actually results in an increase in overall efficiency of an organism, around 50 - 60 %. As in all systems the boundary defines the analysis. An exergy analysis was conducted on a residential <b>dishwashing</b> <b>machine</b> in several boundary configurations in order to develop an appropriate model. Exergy serves as a tool for identifying and quantifying losses in the system so that future works can be aimed at reducing irreversibilities. This model was then compared to data previously available regarding exergy within various processes of a biological cell. In future work, it is this comparison, which can be used to develop metrics for use early in the design stage to more efficiently use available and sustainable resources.

40|$|Abstract — Dynamic sensor network(DSN) {{technology}} {{which is}} based on swarming <b>flight</b> <b>type</b> air node offers analyzed and acquired information on target data gathered by air nodes in rotation flight or 3 dimension array flight. Efficient operation of dynamic sensor network based on air node is possible when problems of processing time, data transmission reliability, power consumption and intermittent connectivity are solved. Delay tolerant network (DTN) can be a desirable alternative to solve those problems. DTN using store-and-forward message switching technology is a solution to intermittent network connectivity, long and variable delay time, asymmetric data rates, and high error rates. However, all processes are performed at the bundle layer, so high power consumption, long processing time, and repeated reliability technique occur.
