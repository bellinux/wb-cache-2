30|$|Discussion In this single-centre {{retrospective}} study, <b>hyperoxaemia</b> is {{four times}} more frequent than hypoxaemia. Even if {{in most of the}} cases, the level of <b>hyperoxaemia</b> remains mild, a wide majority of patients are exposed. Whether or not <b>hyperoxaemia</b> may influence the outcome remains to be determined.|$|E
30|$|Conclusion In this single-centre {{retrospective}} study, <b>hyperoxaemia</b> {{exposure is}} not a rare event during the management of septic shock patients, especially in the first hours of ICU care. Since it has been established that <b>hyperoxaemia</b> {{is associated with a}} poor outcome in cardiac arrest, stroke and myocardial infarction, a possible association between <b>hyperoxaemia</b> and outcome should also be investigated in septic shock.|$|E
30|$|For each {{included}} patient, we estimated, in {{the first}} 72  h of ICU care, a hourly arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2) based {{on the one hand}} on PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio (assuming a linear variation of this ratio between two blood gas analysis) {{and on the other hand}} on the automatic report of FiO 2 in our electronic chart. According to the British Thoracic Society guidelines (1), the <b>hyperoxaemia</b> threshold was 120  mmHg. We differentiated mild <b>hyperoxaemia</b> (120 – 200  mmHg), moderate <b>hyperoxaemia</b> (200 – 300  mmHg) and severe <b>hyperoxaemia</b> (> 300  mmHg). We also investigated whether patients were exposed to hypoxaemia (< 60  mmHg).|$|E
30|$|<b>Hyperoxaemia</b> {{was more}} {{frequent}} {{during the first}} hours of management (26.2  % in the first 24  h and 34.5  % in the first 6  h). Moreover, 82.9  % of the included patients experienced at least one episode of <b>hyperoxaemia.</b>|$|E
40|$|Extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) facilitates organ {{support in}} patients with refractory cardiorespiratory failure whilst disease-modifying treatments can be administered. Improvements to the ECMO process have resulted in its increased utilisation. However, iatrogenic injuries remain, with bleeding and thrombosis the most significant concerns. Many factors contribute {{to the formation of}} thrombi, with the <b>hyperoxaemia</b> experienced during ECMO a potential contributor. Outside of ECMO, emerging evidence associates <b>hyperoxaemia</b> with increased mortality. Currently, no universal definition of <b>hyperoxaemia</b> exists, a gap in clinical standards that may impact patient outcomes. <b>Hyperoxaemia</b> has the potential to induce platelet activation, aggregation and, subsequently, thrombosis through markedly increasing the production of reactive oxygen species. There are minimal data in the current literature that explore the relationship between ECMO-induced <b>hyperoxaemia</b> and the production of reactive oxygen species – a putative link towards pathology. Furthermore, there is limited research directly linking <b>hyperoxaemia</b> and platelet activation. These are areas that warrant investigation as definitive data regarding the nascence of these pathological processes may delineate and define the relative risk of supranormal oxygen tension. These data could then assist in defining optimal oxygenation practice, reducing the risks associated with extracorporeal support...|$|E
30|$|Results During {{the study}} period, 3866 {{patients}} were admitted in our ICU. A diagnosis code of septic shock {{was associated with}} 646 admissions. Two hundred and ten patients {{did not meet the}} exclusion criteria and were included in this study. There was a majority of medical patients (67.1  %), with a median SAPS 2 of 65.5 (IQ 1 57; IQ 3 74) and with a median age of 68.5  years (IQ 1 59.25; IQ 3 75). The ICU mortality was 36.7  %. We were able to estimate 13, 836 PaO 2 in the first 72  h of ICU care for septic shock. The proportion of <b>hyperoxaemia</b> was 19.9  % (17.3  % of mild <b>hyperoxaemia,</b> 2.1  % of moderate <b>hyperoxaemia</b> and 0.5  % of severe <b>hyperoxaemia).</b> By contrast, hypoxemia occurred only for 4.5  % of all the PaO 2 estimates.|$|E
40|$|When {{providing}} {{oxygen therapy}} to a preterm infant, targeting SpO 2 {{is essential for}} avoiding hypoxaemia and/or <b>hyperoxaemia.</b> However, this can be both difficult and challenging for nurses working in a neonatal intensive care unit. The general aim of this thesis project {{was to assess the}} effect of changes in clinical practice regarding oxygen titration and compliance with respect to targeting SpO 2 in preterm infants admitted to our NICU. The stepwise quality improvement project implemented in this thesis project improved compliance with respect to both targeting SpO 2 and improving oxygen titration. This led to improved SpO 2 distribution and decreases in both hypoxaemia and <b>hyperoxaemia,</b> as well as slight improvements in the handling of ABC events and oxygen titration following ABC. The introduction of training sessions, guidelines, and automated oxygen control increased awareness regarding the consequences of hypoxaemia and <b>hyperoxaemia</b> and led to increased efforts to prevent complications...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: to {{determine}} fetal haemodynamic responses to <b>hyperoxaemia</b> and hypoxaemia in early pregnancy. Design: repeated measurements in acute experiments. Setting: experimental physiology laboratory. Methods: non-invasive Doppler ultrasound of the umbilical vein, ductus venosus, umbilical and common carotid arteries of 12 fetal lambs (0. 27 – 0. 56 gestation) during maternal <b>hyperoxaemia</b> and hypoxaemia under ketamine anaesthesia. The effect of gestational age, <b>hyperoxaemia,</b> and hypoxaemia were assessed based on {{analysis of variance}} for dependent measurements and P? 0. 05 was considered significant. Differences between groups were considered significant if the 95 % confidence interval did not include zero. Results: gestational age {{had a significant effect}} on the blood velocity in the umbilical vein and ductus venosus. There were no circulatory changes during <b>hyperoxaemia,</b> but a simultaneous increase of pCO 2 was an important confounder. However, hypoxaemia caused significantly reduced heart rate, reduced maximum and weighted mean blood velocity, and augmented pulsation in the umbilical vein. Hypoxaemia also caused reduced velocities in the ductus venosus (peak velocity during systole and minimum during diastole, and time-averaged velocity) and augmented pulsation of the flow velocity. Additionally, the pulsatility of blood flow increased in the umbilical artery and was reduced in the common carotid artery. Conclusions: maternal hypoxaemia in early pregnancy causes similar fetal circulatory responses to those in late pregnancy: bradycardia, reduced venous flow velocities, augmented pulsatility in veins and a redistributional flow velocity pattern of the umbilical and common carotid arteries...|$|E

40|$|The {{beneficial}} effects of oxygen are widely known, but the potentially {{harmful effects of}} high oxygenation concentrations in blood and tissues have been less widely discussed. Providing supplementary oxygen can increase oxygen delivery in hypoxaemic patients, thus supporting cell function and metabolism and limiting organ dysfunction, but, in patients who are not hypoxaemic, supplemental oxygen will increase oxygen concentrations into nonphysiological hyperoxaemic ranges and {{may be associated with}} harmful effects. Here, we discuss the potentially harmful effects of <b>hyperoxaemia</b> in various groups of critically ill patients, including postcardiac arrest, traumatic brain injury or stroke, and sepsis. In all these groups, there is evidence that hyperoxia can be harmful and that oxygen prescription should be individualized according to repeated assessment of ongoing oxygen requirements.

40|$|In {{the last}} 6 years, 830 asphyxiated newly born term infants have been resuscitated with room air (RAR; n = 304) or 100 % oxygen (OxR; n = 526) in our hospital. We {{have studied the}} time to onset of a regular {{respiratory}} pattern, morbidity and mortality, blood gases, reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidised glutathione (GSSG) and antioxidant enzymes in these infants. No {{significant differences in the}} effectiveness of either gas sources or in the final outcome have been found. The RAR group required a shorter time of positive pres-sure ventilation to attain a spontaneous pattern of respiration. The OxR group showed <b>hyperoxaemia</b> during resuscitation, which was positively correlated with increased GSSG concentrations. Signifi-cant oxidative stress was found in the OxR group at 28 days of post-natal life when compared with normal control infants and the RAR group. Oxygen concentrations used during the resuscitation of new-ly born infants should be strictly monitored. Copyright © 2001 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|E
40|$|Within 48 {{hours of}} the {{institution}} of severe phenylhydrazineinduced anaemia in mice bearing ascites tumours or generalised leukaemia, a substantial proportion of the malignant cells disappeared respectively from the peritoneal cavity or infiltrated liver. The results of radiobiological experiments permitting determination of the proportion of viable leukaemia cells which were severely hypoxic and relatively radioresistant in the livers of leukaemic mice, showed that induction of anaemia {{was associated with a}} several hundredfold increase in the proportion of such cells. The proportion of hypoxic cells was greatly reduced when the anaemic leukaemic mice were transfused with packed erythrocytes or allowed to breathe oxygen under high pressure. Similar experi - ments with solid sarcomas indicated that a high proportion of the tumour cells were hypoxic in non-anaemic mice breathing air. The hypoxic fraction was not significantly reduced when tumour-bearing mice were made severely anaemic during growth of the tumour and were later transfused. Thus, the hypoxic cells in leukaemic livers and those in solid tumours are markedly different in their capacity for oxygenation following the induction of relative <b>hyperoxaemia...</b>|$|E
40|$|During the 4 years 1977 - 80, 14 infants {{developed}} {{retrolental fibroplasia}} (RLF) in the neonatal unit at this medical centre. All were very low birthweight (VLBW) infants who weighed 1500 g or less at birth. The incidence of RLF was 3. 5 % for all VLBW infants admitted for {{neonatal intensive care}} and 4. 7 % for VLBW survivors. The mean birthweight of the affected infants was 970 (range 730 - 1310) g and mean gestational age 26 (range 24 - 29) weeks. Seven of the affected infants (2. 4 % of VLBW survivors) had significant scarring with temporal dragging of the optic disc and retinal detachment. Each of the 14 infants was matched with 2 control infants {{in order to see}} whether any factors predisposing to the development of RLF, including those related to oxygen therapy and monitoring, could be identified. The only factor associated with RLF was a higher volume of blood given with replacement transfusions. The occurrence of RLF was unrelated to an increase in requirement for or duration of oxygen therapy, arterial oxygen tensions as determined by intermittent sampling, or the availability of transcutaneous oxygen monitoring. The care taken in oxygen therapy may have been responsible for failure to show a quantitative association between <b>hyperoxaemia</b> and RLF. Although the problem of oxygen therapy in preterm infants is far from being resolved, current neonatal intensive care methods have limited the occurrence of RLF to VLBW infants. This study demonstrated a lower incidence of RLF in VLBW infants despite an improved survival rate compared with that previously reported...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{effects of}} hypoxaemia, <b>hyperoxaemia</b> and {{hypercapnia}} on {{renal blood flow}} in normal and renal transplant subjects R. A. Sharkey, E. M. T. Mulloy, S. J. O'Neill aa Changes in arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide levels cause alterations in the renal blood flow. Studies have shown variable effects of hypoxaemia and increasing oxy-genation on renal blood flow, although it is generally accepted that severe hypoxaemia reduces renal blood flow [1, 2]. There is more general agreement {{on the effect of}} hypercapnia, which reduces renal blood flow in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Hy-percapnia has also been shown to prevent improvement in renal blood flow with the administration of oxygen [1, 3]. There are very few published studies looking at the acute effects of changes in inspired oxygen and carbon dioxide on renal blood flow in normal subjects [4, 5]. The mechanisms whereby alterations in oxygen and carbon dioxide levels influence renal blood flow are not fully understood. It is thought that the renal nerves and various hormones and neuropeptides including catecho-lamines, dopamine and endothelin are the main factors in-fluencing the changes in renal blood flow [3, 6, 7]. In this study, the effect of different levels of inspired oxygen and carbon dioxide on renal blood flow was compared in nor-mal subjects and in subjects postrenal transplantation, i. e. subjects with denervated kidneys. By comparing these two groups, it could be ascertained whether renal denervation abolished the renovascular responses to the gas inhalations. The development of Doppler ultrasonography has allowed the rapid, accurate, reproducible and noninvasive investiga-tion of renal blood flow and is ideally suited for human studies...|$|E
40|$|UNLABELLED: During {{oxygen therapy}} in preterm infants, {{targeting}} oxygen saturation {{is important for}} avoiding hypoxaemia and <b>hyperoxaemia,</b> but this can be very difficult and challenging for neonatal nurses. We systematically reviewed the qualitative and quantitative studies investigating the compliance in targeting oxygen saturation in preterm infants and factors that influence this compliance. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, CINAHL and ScienceDirect from 2000 to January 2015. Sixteen studies were selected, which involved a total of 2935 nurses and 574 infants. The studies varied in methodology, and we have therefore used a narrative account to describe the data. The main finding {{is that there is}} a low compliance in oxygen targeting; the upper alarm limits are inappropriately set, and maintaining the saturation (SpO 2) below the upper limit presented particular difficulties. Although there is little data available, the studies indicate that training, titration protocols and decreasing workload could improve awareness and compliance. Automated oxygen regulations have been shown to increase the time that SpO 2 is within the target range. CONCLUSION: The compliance in targeting oxygen during oxygen therapy in preterm infants is low, especially in maintaining the SpO 2 below the upper limit. WHAT IS KNOWN: • The use of oxygen in preterm infants is vital, but the optimal strategyremains controversial. • Targeting SpO 2 during oxygen therapy in preterm infants has beenshown to reduce mortality and morbidity. WHAT IS NEW: • Review of the literature showed that the compliance in targeting SpO 2 and alarm settings is low. • Creating awareness of risks of oxygen therapy and benefits in targeting,decreasing nurse/patient ratio and automated oxygen therapy couldincrease compliance...|$|E
40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} the paper by Bellomo and colleagues [1] in the previous issue of Critical Care. We agree with the authors ’ fi nal conclusion that {{there should not be}} a deliberate policy to decrease the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) in the absence of accurate and reliable oximetry. In the developed world, accurate and reliable oximetry and blood gas results are ubiquitous in ICU settings, the context of their study. However, we have issues with the methods used to {{come to the conclusion that}} <b>hyperoxaemia</b> has only a weak relationship with mortality. If one wishes to show no association of hyperoxemia with outcomes, the best approach is to pick the lowest level of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2). By analogy, if one wished to assess the risk of speeding prior to traffi c accidents, one would not look at the lowest speed or the speed at impact; one would, ideally, look at peak speed or average speed. Kilgannon and colleagues [2] used the fi rst blood gas measurement in the ICU and found that hyperoxemia (PaO 2 of at least 300   mm  Hg) was associated with increased risk of death in the hospital. de Jonge and colleagues [3] looked at mean PaO 2 of mechanically ventilated patients in the fi rst 24 hours in ICUs and also reported an increased risk of death in patients with hyperoxemia. We are also concerned that the conclusion of the study relates to hyperoxemia when defi ned as a PaO 2 of greater than 400   mm  Hg whereas the study objective was to analyze the risk of death if the PaO 2 was at least 300 mm  Hg. We understand that the authors did fi nd excess mortality in their intended study group (and in those with a PaO 2 of greater than 200  mm Hg) even after adjust ment for illness severity. We are concerned that their negative conclusion is based on a diff erent (and smaller) post hoc subset of patients with a PaO 2 of greater than 400  mm Hg. By contrast, Kilgannon and colleagues [4] re-analyzed their data and reported a clear dose response with lowest hospital mortality in the PaO 2 range of 60 to 99  mm Hg and they reported a 24 % increase in mortality risk for every 100  mm Hg increase in PaO 2...|$|E
40|$|The study {{pertains}} {{to a series}} of investigations on the effects of CO 2 inhalation as used for pre‐slaughter anaesthesia in swine. Acid/base parameters, blood oxygen tension, plasma Na, K, Ca and stress hormone concentrations were monitored in Yorkshire swine before, during, and for 10 min after the animals were descended for 1 min into 80 % CO 2 in air. Severe respiratory acidosis (Paco 2 ˜ 50 kPa, arterial pH ˜ 6. 6) and hypoxia (Pao 2 ˜ 4 kPa) had developed after 45 s of the CO 2 inhalation. The corresponding changes in venous blood were less drastic (PvCO 2 ˜ 17 kPa, pH 7. 1, Pvo 2 ˜ 4 kPa). Readjustment to PaCO 2 ˜ 11 kPa, arterial pH 7. 2, and Pao 2 ˜ 13 kPa had occurred at 1 min post CO 2. Four minutes later the respiratory acidosis had become converted into metabolic acidosis subjected to partial respiratory compensation (arterial pH 7. 3 in the presence of moderate hypocapnia and <b>hyperoxaemia).</b> The cause of this metabolic acidosis (present also at 10 min post CO 2) was apparently hypoxia‐induced anaerobic metabolism (= lactic acid production). Apparently due to hydrogen ion transport into the cells in exchange for other cations, hyperkalaemia (K˜ 6. 6 mmol 1 ‐l), and a 7 mmol 1 ‐ 1 increase in plasma Na had developed at 1. 5 min later. The CO 2 inhalation did not change the total plasma Ca significantly. The transport of the swine from the stable to the immediate pre‐experimental situation induced a 3 ‐fold increase in plasma Cortisol concentration (PC, to ˜ 130 mmol 1 ‐ 1). No further increase in PC occurred in response to the CO 2 inhalation. It indicates that no additional emotional strain was imposed upon the animals during the CO 2 exposure. Another possibility is that a maximal secretion of Cortisol was here reached already before the descent into the CO 2. The transport procedure caused only minor increases in plasma adrenalin (A) and noradrenaline (NA). However, during the CO 2 exposure plasma A and NA exhibited 15 ‐ and 50 ‐fold rises, respectively (to 3. 5 and 22 mmol l‐ 1, respectively). The main cause of the A/NA elevation seems to have been the severe respiratory acidosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{doctoral}} dissertation {{was to investigate the}} effect of body temperature responses at physiologically relevant sites during an incremental exercise test on the phenomenon of exercise-induced hypoxemia (EIH). This phenomenon has been considered as an important limitation to physical performance with a prevalence of ~ 50 % in trained male athletes, but described in both sexes, across the range of both age and physical fitness in more recent literature. Previously this phenomenon {{has been described as a}} decrement in both arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO₂) and oxy-haemoglobin saturation (SaO₂or SpO₂) with, particularly important for PaO₂, a lack of or inappropriate correction made for the change in body temperature during intense exercise. The initial study of this thesis determined the thermal response within the body at physiologically relevant sites measured simultaneously during an incremental exercise test. The results demonstrated the inadequacy of rectal temperature as an indicator of the acute temperature changes occurring during an incremental exercise test due to its slow response rate and relative thermal inertia. Radial arterial blood and oesophageal temperatures were shown to behave almost identically during the exercise test, albeit with an offset of approximately 1. 3 ºC, and were considered much more appropriate and relevant indicators of thermal changes during exercise. As an extension of the initial work active muscle temperature (vastus lateralis) was measured during the exercise test, demonstrating a significantly lower resting temperature than the oft-reported “core” temperatures (rectal and oesophageal) as well as a significantly greater increase in temperature in comparison to all other measurement sites. Overall, the results of this first study indicated that the physiologically relevant temperatures measured at the oesophageal and muscle sites differed markedly to the outdated rectal temperature measurement site and should be used as measures of thermal response when evaluating oxygen loading (oesophageal) or unloading (active muscle). Utilising the definition of EIH as a decrease in PaO₂ of ≥ 10 mmHg, the effect of temperature correcting PaO₂ was evaluated in the second study. Arterial blood gases measured simultaneously to the temperature measurements during the incremental exercise test were adjusted for the temperature changes at each site (every 1 ºC increase in temperature will increase a PaO₂ value by ~ 5 mmHg). Whilst uncorrected PaO₂ values indicated an almost 100 % prevalence of EIH in this group, oesophageal temperature corrected PaO₂ values decreased this prevalence to ~ 50 % while muscle temperature corrections resolved all cases of EIH and demonstrated an <b>HYPEROXAEMIA</b> (i. e. the reverse of the well-established phenomenon) in the majority of subjects. Further investigation of arterial oxygen content during the exercise test indicates that there is no disruption in the delivery of oxygen to the active muscles and therefore any performance decrement should be attributed to another mechanism. Whilst the phenomenon of EIH is determined by the definition applied and the use of temperature corrections in the case of PaO₂, its reproducibility in a test-retest situation had not previously been determined. Utilising a subset of previously tested subjects, the reproducibility of both temperature and PaO₂ were determined with results indicating that the blood gas response was highly reproducible, especially the minimum PaO₂ value noted during each exercise test. However, comparing a more statistically relevant definition of a change in PaO₂ of ± 2 standard deviations from the mean resting PaO₂ to the previous delimiter of 10 mmHg indicated a lesser reproducibility of the prevalence of EIH. In summary, this thesis exposes the inadequacies of previous research into EIH with regard to the expected reproducibility of the phenomenon and the need to correctly adjust PaO₂ values for exercise-induce hyperthermia as well as demonstrating the difference in thermal responses to acute exercise in physiologically significant areas of the body. Furthermore, previously described correlations between the change in PaO₂ and VO₂ max were not evident in the subjects tested within this thesis, nor was there any indication of a diffusion limitation based on reduced pulmonary capillary transit time (by association with VO₂ max) or pulmonary oedema (rebuked by a rapid return of PaO₂ to above resting levels following exercise cessation).
