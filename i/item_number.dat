5000|$|<b>Item</b> <b>numbers</b> {{have been}} criticized for their {{gratuitous}} objectification of women. <b>Item</b> <b>numbers</b> have also been imitated in Mumbai's bar dancers. In respect of the ban on bar dancers in Mumbai, it has even been argued that the morality of bar dancer's imitation of <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> cannot be questioned without questioning the morality of screening of <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> in a film in public theatres.

40|$|ABSTRACT : BACKGROUND : On 1 November 2000, {{a series}} of new <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> {{was added to the}} Medicare Benefits Schedule, which allowed for case {{conferences}} between physicians (including psychiatrists) and other multidisciplinary providers. On 1 November 2002, an additional set of numbers was added, designed especially for use by psychiatrists. This paper reports the findings of an evaluation of these <b>item</b> <b>numbers.</b> RESULTS : The uptake of the <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> in the three years post their introduction was low to moderate at best. Eighty nine psychiatrists rendered 479 case conferences at a cost to the Health Insurance Commission of $ 70, 584. Psychiatrists who have used the <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> are generally positive about them, as are consumers. Psychiatrists who have not used them have generally not done so {{because of a lack of}} knowledge, rather than direct opposition. The use of the <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> is increasing over time, perhaps as psychiatrists become more aware of their existence and of their utility in maximising quality of care. CONCLUSION : The case conferencing <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> have potential, but as yet this potential is not being realised. Some small changes to the conditions associated with the use of the <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> could assist their uptake...|$|R

In order to feature an <b>item</b> <b>number</b> in the film, producer Johar wanted to sign Kareena Kapoor, who refused the offer and Katrina Kaif was eventually contracted.

40|$|BACKGROUND: As of 1 July 2005, the Medicare Benefits Schedule {{includes}} additional {{chronic disease}} management (CDM) <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> offering general practitioners more options for managing {{patients with chronic}} conditions, including those requiring multidisciplinary care. The new <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> are {{not a substitute for}} normal medical care but expand the possibilities for GPs and their patients. OBJECTIVE: This article provides a practical overview of the use of the CDM <b>item</b> <b>numbers.</b> DISCUSSION: A GP management plan (GPMP) if undertaken with team care arrangements (TCA) largely equates to the previous Enhanced Primary Care plan. The role of a practice nurse assisting in preparation of both a GPMP and TCA is now clearer and more inclusive. There is also increased flexibility in who can be involved in the review of these patients...|$|R

The role of the comedian was tipped to go Vadivelu, after he received rave reviews for his comic chemistry in Chandramukhi with Rajinikanth, however, despite the reviews, Vishnuvardhan's regular pattern meant that the spotlight for a comedian will be limited.
