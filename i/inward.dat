5|$|This planet, like b and e, has likely {{migrated}} <b>inward.</b>|$|E
5|$|Reading is an {{important}} commercial centre in the Thames Valley and Southern England. The town hosts the headquarters of several British companies and the UK offices of foreign multinationals, {{as well as being}} a major retail centre. Whilst located close enough to London to be sometimes regarded as part of the London commuter belt, Reading is a net <b>inward</b> destination for commuters. During the morning peak period, there are some 30,000 <b>inward</b> arrivals in the town, compared to 24,000 departures.|$|E
5|$|The {{outermost}} {{three of}} the known planets likely formed further away from the star, and migrated <b>inward.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{meteorological}} {{factors contributing to}} a storm surge are a long fetch of winds spiraling <b>inward</b> toward the storm, and a low-pressure-induced dome of water drawn up under and trailing the storm's center.|$|E
5|$|Those {{relatively}} rare comets with orbits of about 10,000AU have probably gone through {{one or more}} orbits through the Solar System and have had their orbits drawn <b>inward</b> by {{the gravity of the}} planets.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the {{trochlear nerve}} (IV) {{can also cause}} {{diplopia}} with the eye adducted and elevated. The result will be an eye which can not move downwards properly (especially downwards when in an <b>inward</b> position). This is due to impairment in the superior oblique muscle, which is innervated by the trochlear nerve.|$|E
5|$|Entropion is the <b>inward</b> rolling {{of the eye}}lid, {{commonly}} {{the lower}} lid. This in turn irritates the cornea of the eye and can cause visual impairment. It is a hereditary disorder seen in both English and American Cocker Spaniels, King Charles Spaniels, English Springer Spaniels plus a variety of non spaniel breeds.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 Voyager 2 {{detected}} {{a broad and}} faint sheet of material <b>inward</b> of ring 6. This ring was given the temporary designation 1986U2R. It had a normal optical depth of 10−3 or less and was extremely faint. It was visible only in a single Voyager 2 image. The ring was located between 37,000 and 39,500km from the centre of Uranus, or only about 12,000km above the clouds. It was not observed again until 2003–2004, when the Keck telescope found a broad and faint sheet of material just inside ring 6. This ring was dubbed the ζ ring. However, {{the position of the}} recovered ζ ring differs significantly from that observed in 1986. Now it is situated between 37,850 and 41,350km from the centre of the planet. There is an <b>inward</b> gradually fading extension reaching to at least 32,600km, or possibly even to 27,000km—to the atmosphere of Uranus. These extensions are labelled as the ζc and ζcc rings respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, a {{study of}} how the orbits of Saturn's moons should have changed due to tidal effects {{suggested}} that all of Saturn's satellites <b>inward</b> of Titan, including Enceladus (whose geologic activity was used to derive the strength of tidal effects on Saturn's satellites), may have formed as little as 100 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, {{a public}} sector <b>inward</b> {{investment}} organisation was launched, called Into Somerset, {{with the intention}} of growing the county's economy by promoting it to businesses that may wish to relocate {{from other parts of the}} UK (especially London) and the world.|$|E
5|$|Once {{through this}} door, which swung <b>inward,</b> Booth barricaded it by wedging a stick {{between it and}} the wall. From here a second door led to Lincoln's box. There is {{evidence}} that, earlier in the day, Booth had bored a peephole in this second door, though this is not certain.|$|E
5|$|Pterosaurs' hip sockets are {{oriented}} facing slightly upwards, and {{the head}} of the femur (thigh bone) is only moderately <b>inward</b> facing, suggesting that pterosaurs had an erect stance. It would have been possible to lift the thigh into a horizontal position during flight, as gliding lizards do.|$|E
5|$|The centaurs, {{which are}} not {{normally}} {{considered part of the}} Kuiper belt, are also thought to be scattered objects, the only difference being that they were scattered <b>inward,</b> rather than outward. The Minor Planet Center groups the centaurs and the SDOs together as scattered objects.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the Blattodea (cockroaches and termites) {{shown in the}} cladogram are based on Eggleton, Beccaloni & <b>Inward</b> (2007). The cockroach families Lamproblattidae and Tryonicidae are not shown but are placed within the superfamily Blattoidea. The cockroach families Corydiidae and Ectobiidae were previously known as the Polyphagidae and Blattellidae.|$|E
5|$|The {{low mass}} of the planet has led to {{suggestions}} {{that it may be}} a terrestrial planet. This type of massive terrestrial planet could be formed in the inner part of the Gliese 876 system from material pushed towards the star by the <b>inward</b> migration of the gas giants.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbit of}} Thebe lies near {{the outer edge}} of the Thebe gossamer ring, which is {{composed}} of the dust ejected from the satellite. After ejection the dust drifts in the direction of the planet under the action of Poynting–Robertson drag forming a ring <b>inward</b> of the moon.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} processes behind pulmonary contusion are poorly understood. However, {{it is known}} that lung tissue can be crushed when the chest wall bends <b>inward</b> on impact. Three other possible mechanisms have been suggested: the inertial effect, the spalling effect, and the implosion effect.|$|E
5|$|Trescothick {{was also}} named Most Valuable Player by the Professional Cricketers' Association for his 2,934 runs in all {{competitions}} in the 2009 season, 1,745 {{of these in}} the County Championship. Over the winter he starred in a short film to promote Somerset, commissioned by <b>inward</b> investment agency Into Somerset.|$|E
5|$|With {{economies of}} scale, the PPF would curve <b>inward,</b> with the {{opportunity}} cost of one good falling as more of it is produced. Specialization in producing successive units of a good determines its opportunity cost (say from mass production methods or specialization of labor).|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{asteroid}} bodies, {{the asteroid belt}} also contains bands of dust with particle radii of up to a few hundred micrometres. This fine material is produced, at least in part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids. Due to the Poynting–Robertson effect, the pressure of solar radiation causes this dust to slowly spiral <b>inward</b> toward the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major theme}} of East End {{history has been}} that of migration; both <b>inward</b> and outward. The area had a strong pull on the rural poor {{from other parts of}} England and {{attracted}} waves of migration from further afield: notably Huguenot refugees, who created a new extramural suburb in Spitalfields in the 17th century., Irish weavers, Ashkenazi Jews and, in the 20th century, Sylheti Bangladeshis.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1973 oil crisis, {{combined}} with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Non-Aligned Movement, less-powerful countries had more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower. Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention <b>inward</b> to deal with the Soviet Union's deep-seated domestic economic problems. During this period, Soviet leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of détente.|$|E
5|$|Caroline Island {{is heavily}} vegetated, and most islets possess three ringed zones of vegetation: an {{outermost}} herb mat, typically composed mainly of Heliotropium anomalum; an <b>inward</b> zone of shrub, primarily Heliotropium foertherianum; and a central forested region, typically dominated by groves of Pisonia grandis trees. Coconut palms {{have also been}} introduced and exist in substantial quantities on the larger islets. This pattern of vegetation is consistent across the larger islets, with smaller islets lacking the central forest and the smallest vegetated solely by low herbs. Other common plants include Suriana maritima and Morinda citrifolia.|$|E
5|$|Family {{and family}} history also plays an {{important}} role in the poem. Eliot found information on his family from Sketch of the Eliot Family, which described how Eliot's family lived in East Coker for 200 years. When Andrew Eliott left, he disrupted the family history. Similarly, Eliot broke from his own family when he travelled away from his family, a family that he saw was declining. Within the poem, Eliot emphasizes the need for a journey and the need for <b>inward</b> change.|$|E
5|$|For {{internal}} broaching {{the sides of}} the broach are drafted <b>inward</b> so it becomes thinner; for external broaching the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the broach is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the broach is pressed against the workpiece, but is driven by the tool holder.|$|E
5|$|Identified {{risk factors}} for plantar {{fasciitis}} include excessive running, standing on hard surfaces for prolonged periods of time, high arches of the feet, {{the presence of a}} leg length inequality, and flat feet. The tendency of flat feet to excessively roll <b>inward</b> during walking or running makes them more susceptible to plantar fasciitis. Obesity is seen in 70% of individuals who present with plantar fasciitis and is an independent risk factor.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, a cyclone is a {{large scale}} air mass that rotates around a strong center of low {{atmospheric}} pressure. Cyclones are characterized by <b>inward</b> spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale (the synoptic scale). Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Pilcher of the {{architectural}} firm Pilcher and Tachau {{served as an}} art professor at Vassar between 1900 and 1911; his firm {{was responsible for the}} design of the house. Jewett was built {{at the north end of}} the residential quad, northwest of Lathrop House and northeast of Davison House. Later projects saw the erection of Josselyn House (1912) to Jewett's west and the Students' Building (1913) to its east. It is the only building on the quad, including Rockefeller Hall, with its main facade facing <b>inward.</b>|$|E
5|$|Models by Julio Ángel Fernández {{suggest that}} the {{scattered}} disc, which is the main source for periodic comets in the Solar System, might also be the primary source for Oort cloud objects. According to the models, {{about half of the}} objects scattered travel outward toward the Oort cloud, whereas a quarter are shifted <b>inward</b> to Jupiter's orbit, and a quarter are ejected on hyperbolic orbits. The scattered disc might still be supplying the Oort cloud with material. A third of the scattered disc's population is likely to end up in the Oort cloud after 2.5billion years.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{has been}} linked with genetic mutations in genes that code for certain ion channels that transport electrolytes (sodium and potassium) across cell membranes. The main ones are the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit and potassium <b>inward</b> rectifier 2.6; it is therefore classified as a channelopathy. The abnormality in the channel is thought to lead to shifts of potassium into cells, under conditions of high thyroxine (thyroid hormone) levels, usually with an additional precipitant.|$|E
5|$|The eyewall {{may vary}} {{over time in}} the form of eyewall {{replacement}} cycles, particularly in intense tropical cyclones. Outer rainbands can organize into an outer ring of thunderstorms that slowly moves <b>inward,</b> which is believed to rob the primary eyewall of moisture and angular momentum. When the primary eyewall weakens, the tropical cyclone weakens temporarily. The outer eyewall eventually replaces the primary one {{at the end of the}} cycle, at which time the storm may return to its original intensity.|$|E
5|$|The inner region around Epsilon Eridani, from a {{radius of}} 2.5AU <b>inward,</b> {{appears to be}} clear of dust down to the {{detection}} limit of the 6.5m MMT telescope. Grains of dust in this region are efficiently removed by drag from the stellar wind, while {{the presence of a}} planetary system may also help keep this area clear of debris. Still, this does not preclude the possibility that an inner asteroid belt may be present with a combined mass no greater than the asteroid belt in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The {{outermost}} ring, Adams, contains five prominent arcs now named Courage, Liberté, Egalité1, Egalité2 and Fraternité (Courage, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity). The {{existence of}} arcs {{was difficult to}} explain because the laws of motion would predict that arcs would spread out into a uniform ring over short timescales. Astronomers now estimate that the arcs are corralled into their current form by the gravitational effects of Galatea, a moon just <b>inward</b> from the ring.|$|E
5|$|The {{red panda}} is {{specialized}} as a bamboo feeder with strong, curved and sharp semi-retractile claws standing <b>inward</b> for grasping narrow tree branches, leaves, and fruit. Like the giant panda, {{it has a}} “false thumb” which {{is an extension of}} the wrist bone. When descending a tree head-first, the red panda rotates its ankle to control its descent, one of the few climbing species to do so.|$|E
5|$|The {{scattered}} disc {{is a very}} dynamic environment. Because {{they are}} still capable of being perturbed by Neptune, SDOs' orbits are always in danger of disruption; either of being sent outward to the Oort cloud or <b>inward</b> into the centaur population and ultimately the Jupiter family of comets. For this reason Gladman et al. prefer {{to refer to the}} region as the scattering disc, rather than scattered. Unlike Kuiper-belt objects (KBOs), the orbits of scattered-disc objects can be inclined as much as 40° from the ecliptic.|$|E
5|$|The ζ {{ring was}} {{observed}} {{again during the}} ring plane-crossing event in 2007 when it became the brightest feature of the ring system, outshining all other rings combined. The equivalent optical depth of this ring is near 1km (0.6km for the <b>inward</b> extension), while the normal optical depth is again less than 10−3. Rather different appearances of the 1986U2R and ζ rings {{may be caused by}} different viewing geometries: back-scattering geometry in 2003–2007 and side-scattering geometry in 1986. However, changes during the past 20 years in the distribution of dust, which is thought to predominate in the ring, cannot be ruled out.|$|E
