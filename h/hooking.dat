5|$|In June 2006 the EIHL {{announced}} {{the adoption of}} the 'zero tolerance' interpretation of the rules with regard to holding, <b>hooking</b> and interference implemented in the National Hockey League during the 2005–06 season. These rules had proved highly successful in the NHL, increasing the pace of the game and leading to a rise in spectator numbers.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2005–06 season, the NHL instituted several new rules. Some {{of them were}} already used by the IIHF, such as the shootout and making the two-line pass legal. Others which were not {{picked up by the}} IIHF, such as {{requiring}} smaller goaltender equipment and the addition of the goaltender trapezoid to the rink. However, the IIHF did agree to follow the NHL's league's zero-tolerance policy on obstruction and required referees to call more <b>hooking,</b> holding and interference penalties. In 2006, the IIHF voted to eliminate tie games and institute a three-point system: wins in regulation time would be worth three points, overtime wins would be two points and over-time losses would be worth one point. The system was first used at the 2007 World Championships.|$|E
5|$|Identified as {{a future}} Test prospect, he was {{selected}} in a Western Australia Combined XI for a match against the touring England cricket team {{at the start of}} the 1958–59 season in Perth. Prior to the match, O'Neill was hounded by the media. The tourists decided to test him with short-pitched bowling, especially Fred Trueman. O'Neill decided to abstain from <b>hooking,</b> while attacking the spin of Jim Laker with a series of sweep shots. After four and a half hours of uncharacteristic restraint, he compiled 104 with an emphasis on off side play. He took a total of 2/67, removing Fred Trueman and Arthur Milton.|$|E

5|$|In 193233, McCabe {{made his}} {{breakthrough}} at international {{level in the}} First Test of the infamous Bodyline series, scoring an unbeaten 187 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in only four hours as his teammates fell around him. McCabe attacked the bowling vigorously, <b>hooking</b> relentlessly. He ended the series as the only Australian other than Bradman to score a century. McCabe missed most of the next season due to illness, but was retained for the 1934 tour of England despite his interrupted preparation. He scored 2,078 runs and eight centuries for the tour, including his maiden Test century in England. Following the retirement of captain Bill Woodfull {{at the end of}} the tour, McCabe became Australia’s vice-captain and held the post for the rest of his career.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} match against Essex, Loxton returned as Australia won the toss, batted first {{and went on}} to score a world record of 721 first-class runs in one day’s play. Loxton came in at 4/452 and put on 56 with Ron Hamence and 166 with Ron Saggers in 65 minutes before falling at 6/664 for 120. Loxton's innings was noted for its <b>hooking</b> and driving and took around 80 minutes. During the innings, Loxton also passed 1,000 first-class career runs. Australia collapsed after Loxton's departure, losing their last five wickets for 57 late on the first day.|$|E

Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his <b>hooking</b> and off-driving; it took a run out to remove Morris. Australia were eventually out for 389. Morris had scored {{more than half the}} runs {{as the rest of the}} team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. England had relied heavily on spin; two thirds of the overs were delivered by the two spinners.|$|E

50|$|The big {{breakthrough}} George de Mestral {{made was}} {{to think about}} hook-and-eye closures on a greatly reduced scale. <b>Hook</b> and eye fasteners have been common for centuries, but what was new about <b>hook</b> and loop fasteners was the miniaturisation of the <b>hooks</b> and eyes. Shrinking the <b>hooks</b> led to the two other important differences. Firstly, instead of a single-file line of <b>hooks,</b> touch fasteners have a two-dimensional surface. This was needed, because in decreasing {{the size of the}} <b>hooks,</b> the strength was also unavoidably lessened, thus requiring more <b>hooks</b> for the same strength. The other difference is that <b>hook</b> and loop has indeterminate match-up between the <b>hooks</b> and eyes. With larger <b>hook</b> and eye fasteners, each <b>hook</b> has its own eye. On a scale as small as that of <b>hook</b> and loop fasteners, matching up each of these <b>hooks</b> with the corresponding eye is impractical, thus leading to the indeterminate matching.|$|R

5|$|Retaining {{his place}} for the third Test that started just days later on the same ground, Kippax {{maintained}} his superb form and hit his maiden Test century in Australia’s first innings. With Australia struggling against the pace of England's Harold Larwood, Kippax steadied the innings and then launched an assault on Larwood, <b>hooking</b> him for four boundaries. Journalist Ray Robinson pointed out that before Kippax’s flurry of fours, Larwood had taken 14 wickets at 18.3runs in the series. After, he managed only four wickets for 472runs. Kippax followed up with 41 in the second innings, as Australia fell to their third consecutive defeat in the rubber and lost the Ashes.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} as a {{tropical}} storm, the thunderstorm activity around Kristy {{appeared to be}} organizing into <b>hooking</b> bands, and further intensification was considered likely, potentially as strong as 60mph (95km/h). However, the thunderstorm activity decreased markedly on September6, primarily from dry air entrainment, and it weakened to tropical depression status for the last time. In one forecast, Kristy was predicted {{to move into the}} area of warning responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, or west of 140°W. However, the depression was unable to maintain organized convection around its center for a few days, and Kristy degenerated into a remnant low on September8. The low turned to the southwest, degenerating into a tropical wave on September9 about 1500miles (2400km) southeast of the island of Hawaii, or about 1600miles (2600km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. The remnant disturbance continued westward, and initially Kristy was believed to have developed into Tropical Depression Two-C in the central Pacific Ocean; however, post-season analysis concluded the systems were separate.|$|E
5|$|Hodgkinson {{worked his}} way around to the left towards the Indonesian line of approach, {{subsequently}} engaging and killing two more, and wounding a third. Guest gathered the right hand elements of 7 Platoon, <b>hooking</b> around Hodgkinson and counter-attacking the remaining Indonesians, killing the previously wounded soldier and one other. Yet another wounded Indonesian was observed to crawl away while the tenth proceeded to run off unharmed back in the direction from which the patrol had come. Within twenty minutes the contact was over and the Australians proceeded to collect the discarded Indonesian weapons and equipment, including a Browning Automatic Rifle, three MI rifles and 200 rounds of ammunition. Dressed in US steel helmets, green shirts and blue and khaki shorts, the Indonesian soldiers were subsequently identified as members of 440 Battalion.|$|E

50|$|The <b>hook</b> {{point is}} {{probably}} {{the most important part of}} the <b>hook.</b> It is the point that must penetrate fish flesh and secure the fish. The profile of the <b>hook</b> point and its length influence how well the point penetrates. The barb influences how far the point penetrates, how much pressure is required to penetrate and ultimately the holding power of the <b>hook.</b> <b>Hook</b> points are mechanically (ground) or chemically sharpened. Some <b>hooks</b> are barbless. Historically, many ancient fish <b>hooks</b> were barbless, but today a barbless <b>hook</b> is used to make <b>hook</b> removal and fish release less stressful on the fish. <b>Hook</b> points are also described relative to their offset from the <b>hook</b> shank. A kirbed <b>hook</b> point is offset to the left, a straight point has no offset and a reversed point is offset to the right. Care needs to be taken when handling <b>hooks</b> as they can 'hook' the user. If a <b>hook</b> goes in deep enough below the barb, pulling the <b>hook</b> out will tear the flesh. There are three methods to remove a <b>hook.</b> The first is by cutting the flesh to remove it. The second is to cut the eye of the <b>hook</b> off and then push the remainder of the <b>hook</b> through the flesh and the third is to place pressure on the shank towards the flesh which pulls the barb into the now oval hole then push the <b>hook</b> out the way it came in.|$|R

5|$|Loxton {{came in and}} {{accompanied}} Morris for 39 further runs before falling to Edrich. Lindwall fell for nine before Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his <b>hooking</b> and off-driving. It took a run out to remove Morris; he attempted a quick run after the ball was hit to third man. Morris was called through for a run by Don Tallon, {{but he was too}} slow for the substitute fielder Reg Simpson's arm. Australia went on to finish with 389. Morris had scored more than half the runs {{as the rest of the}} team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. Hollies tossed the ball up repeatedly, coaxing the Australians into attacking balls that spun after pitching on off stump. Morris took four catches for the match as Australia took victory by an innings and 149 runs, sealing a 40 Test series triumph.|$|E
5|$|Octopus {{fisheries}} exist {{around the}} world with total catches varying between 245,320 and 322,999 metric tons from 1986 to 1995. The world catch peaked in 2007 at 380,000 tons, and fell by a tenth by 2012. Methods to capture octopuses include pots, traps, trawls, snares, drift fishing, spearing, <b>hooking</b> and hand collection. Octopus is eaten in many cultures and is a common food on the Mediterranean and Asian coasts. The arms and sometimes other body parts are prepared in various ways, often varying by species or geography. Live octopuses are eaten in several countries {{around the world}}, including the US. Animal welfare groups have objected to this practice on the basis that octopuses can experience pain. Octopuses have a food conversion efficiency greater than that of chickens, making octopus aquaculture a possibility.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 2001, Space Shuttle Atlantis docked to the ISS, {{bringing}} the five American crew members of STS-98 temporarily to the station. The mission was originally planned for mid-January, but was delayed due to NASA's concerns about some cables on the shuttles. This mission brought the U.S. built Destiny laboratory, {{which has a}} mass of 16 short tons. It was installed {{with the use of}} the shuttle's robotic Canadarm, controlled by Marsha Ivins. Astronauts Thomas D. Jones and Robert L. Curbeam helped with the installation during a spacewalk. The Destiny module had a cost of US$1.4billion, and would be used primarily for scientific research. During the spacewalk an ammonia coolant leak created a contamination scare, which happened when Curbeam was <b>hooking</b> up coolant lines to Destiny. The other two spacewalks went ahead without any problems. While the Shuttle was docked, the control of the station's orientation was switched from propellants to electrically powered gyroscopes, which had been installed in September 2000. The gyroscopes had not been used earlier due to the lack of key navigational electronics.|$|E

5|$|The injured all-rounder missed two matches {{to recuperate}} before reappearing in mid-May, hitting 120 as the Australians posted {{a total of}} 721 against Essex {{in a single day}} at Southend, still the highest single day's total in {{first-class}} cricket. He put on 166 in 65 minutes with Ron Saggers, who, with Bill Brown and Donald Bradman, also scored centuries. Loxton's rapid innings was noted for its <b>hooking</b> and driving and took around 80 minutes. He followed up with an unbeaten 79 and two wickets in the match against Oxford University, but that failed to win him a place in the first set-piece battle of the summer, against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full-strength Test outfit, while Australia fielded their strongest XI, so the fixture was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests. Bradman opted to play Brown out of the position in the middle-order, and Loxton missed out; Australia went on to win by an innings.|$|E

Batman can use his cape {{to glide}} around Gotham City and the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to hard-to-reach ledges and extend his flight. Some gadgets from previous Arkham games are present {{at the start of}} Arkham Origins, while others become available during play. Returning gadgets include the Cryptographic Sequencer, used to hack security consoles; the Batclaw, used for <b>hooking</b> onto surfaces; the Batarang, a throwing weapon; the Remote Batarang, its remote-controlled counterpart; Explosive Gel, used to destroy weak surfaces and knock down enemies; Smoke Pellets, used for stealthy exits and entrances; the Disruptor, which can remotely disable guns and explosive mines, and the Grapnel Accelerator, an earlier version of the Grapnel Boost. New equipment in Batman's arsenal include the Remote Claw; this allows Batman to target two objects and pull them together, allowing him to throw enemies into each other or hit them with objects (tethering two walled points creates a tightrope for Batman to cross); Shock Gloves, which allow Batman to block electric attacks, disable some enemies and stun shielded ones, and short-circuit objects, and the Concussion Detonator, capable of stunning large enemy groups.|$|E
5000|$|Adding {{a trailer}} <b>hook</b> or [...] "stinger" [...] <b>hook</b> (either a single or treble <b>hook)</b> behind the main spinnerbait <b>hook</b> {{is also a}} {{personal}} preference and may ensure a better hookup as well preventing fish that jump from throwing the bait. Some anglers prefer the single <b>hook</b> to be rigged so that the point is down, especially in open-water situations. Others prefer it rigged point-up. In either case the <b>hook</b> must be prevented from coming off the main <b>hook</b> or grabbing weeds. One way to accomplish this is to use rubber or silicone tubing cut to 1/8", inserting {{the eye of the}} trailer <b>hook</b> and forcing the main <b>hook</b> through the tube-covered eye. The trailer <b>hook</b> is now fixed stationary behind the main <b>hook.</b> Another way allows the <b>hook</b> more side to side motion and consists of stops above and below the eye placed on the main <b>hook.</b> These stops can be 1/8-inch cut silicone tubing or disks hole-punched from the plastic lid of a coffee can or wide rubber bands and placed above and below the trailer <b>hook</b> eye encircling the main <b>hook.</b>|$|R

5|$|Early in {{the second}} period the Crunch got another power play {{opportunity}} when Senators' captain Drew Bannister took a <b>hooking</b> penalty. The man advantage did not benefit Syracuse as the Senators tied the game 1–1 when Martin St. Pierre found an open Josh Hennessy, who put the puck past Kevin Lalande for the shorthanded goal. Binghamton seemed to be gaining the advantage {{in the second}} period outshooting the Crunch 16–9. But, with just 11.7 seconds remaining in the period, Crunch defenseman David Liffiton scored the go-ahead goal from the high slot. During the third period the score remained the same, when with just 1:30 left in the game Syracuse's Kevin Harvey took an interference penalty giving the Senators a chance to tie the game on the power play. Binghamton was unable to score in the first minute of the power play and pulled Brodeur to give them the six on four advantage. Even with the two man advantage the Senators failed to post a second goal on Lalande, who stopped 36 of the 37 shots he faced during the game helping the Crunch to the 2–1 victory. His performance earned him the first Star of the Game. The game was a penalty-filled affair with 26 infractions called on the two teams and a total of 18 power plays awarded. Neither team was able to capitalize on the opportunities, with Binghamton going 0–10 and Syracuse 0–8.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test in Sydney, with England captain Douglas Jardine again {{employed}} Bodyline. This involved constant intimidatory short-pitched leg-side bowling with a leg-cordon {{to catch}} balls fended {{off by the}} batsman, {{in an attempt to}} curtail Donald Bradman, generally regarded as the best batsman ever, from scoring. McCabe came to the wicket on the first day, the score at 3/82 with Bill Woodfull, Bill Ponsford and Jack Fingleton already dismissed, and Bradman not playing due to illness. Having warned his parents, who were watching him in Test cricket for the only time, not to jump the fence if he was hit, McCabe took guard. Jardine had deployed seven men on the leg-side, usually with five close catchers and two men patrolling the boundary for hook shots. McCabe hooked the first ball he received from Bodyline spearhead Harold Larwood for a boundary. After Kippax fell with the score at 87, McCabe and Vic Richardson added 129 before Richardson fell. McCabe reached stumps at 127 not out with the total 6/290. His innings was marked by dangerous cutting and compulsive <b>hooking</b> of short-pitched deliveries in front of his face, unfazed by the repeated body blows which hit his teammates.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} morning, Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped Hassett for 37 after 134 minutes of batting.

Loxton accompanied Morris for 39 further runs before Edrich removed him for 15. Young removed Lindwall for nine before Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his <b>hooking</b> and off-driving. It took a run out to remove Morris; he had attempted a quick run after the ball was hit to third man but was not agile enough for the substitute fielder's arm. Tallon, who scored 31, put on another 30 runs with Ring, before both were out on 389, ending Australia's innings. Morris had scored {{more than half the}} runs {{as the rest of the}} team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131.
