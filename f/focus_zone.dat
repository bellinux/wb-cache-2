This unit is one part of a test system, which has the capability to characterize ultrasound transducer arrays up to 128 elements. This beamformer consists of three stages: delay unit, delay switches and summing unit. They have the following characteristics: the delay and summing units are realized in the analog domain, utilizing 4 -zone dynamic focusing, and dynamic aperture switching with very wide bandwidth. The delay unit consists of a set of fixed delays with Sns resolution, and a set of adjustable delay lines with a resolution of 1 ns. A set of 4 : 1 multiplexers is used to switch the different delays for different <b>focusing</b> <b>zones.</b> In our system, the focal range is divided into 4 zones consisting of a near, middle, far and fourth zone with a different set of delays for each zone.

We present here petrological and geochemical data on volcanic rocks dredged from Graham and Nameless banks and Pantelleria seamounts in the Pelagian sector of the Sicily Channel Rift. Petrological evidence suggests that the ascent of magmas to the surface was relatively rapid, probably through channels superimposed over the major tectonic discontinuities of the Rift. Major and trace element data indicate an ocean island basalt affinity for Graham and Nameless bank alkaline lavas and a depleted tholeiitic signature for one Pantelleria seamount, which had a shallower mantle source. Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions suggest a heterogeneous mantle source involving both <b>focus</b> <b>zone</b> (FOZO) and high- mu(HIMU) components. Lead isotopic compositions are slightly less radiogenic in the tholeiitic basalt and more radiogenic (closer to HIMU) in the alkaline lavas. We hypothesize that a decompressional melting mechanism affected the mantle beneath the Sicily Channel at different levels. Our data fit in a regional scenario characterized by the presence of HIMU or FOZO components in alkaline and calc-alkaline volcanics all around Sicily.

The Ofu {{data suggest that the}} high 3 He/ 4 He mantle component thought to be common to all oceanic hotspots, called FOZO (<b>Focus</b> <b>Zone),</b> is not homogeneous. Sr, Nd and Pb isotopes in Ofu lavas indicate that the Samoan high 3 He/ 4 He component is isotopically distinct from the high 3 He/ 4 He lavas from Hawaii, Iceland and Galapagos. Along with Samoa, the highest 3 He/ 4 He sample from each southern hemisphere high 3 He/ 4 He hotspot exhibits lower 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios than their counterparts in the northern hemisphere (excluding lavas erupted in continental, back-arc, and submarine ridge environments). The observation of a large-scale isotopic enrichment (generally higher 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and lower 143 Nd/ 144 Nd) in the FOZO-A (austral) high 3 He/ 4 He mantle compared to the FOZO-B (boreal) high 3 He/ 4 He mantle is similar to the DUPAL anomaly, a globe-encircling feature of isotopic enrichment observed primarily in southern hemisphere ocean island basalts.

40|$|The {{origin of}} the Juan Fernandez Islands in the South Pacific is of {{geologic}} importance due to high- 3 He/ 4 He ratios that span a considerable range (7. 8 - 18. 0 Ra). To constrain the petrogenesis and mantle source of the islands, bulk trace element abundances and Pb isotopic compositions were obtained for mafic lavas from islands Robinson Crusoe and Alexander Selkirk. Trace element data confirm grouping where on Robinson Crusoe, group I represents the shield-building phase and group II represents post-shield building. Group III represents shield-building on Alexander Selkirk. Sub-parallel incompatible trace elements patterns among all samples suggest a common mantle origin. Shield-building groups I and III have nearly identical trace element concentrations, and lower Nb/Zr, Ba/Zr and La/YbN than the more enriched group II. Incompatible trace element modeling indicate group III was produced by the highest degree of partial melting, while low degrees of partial melting plus fractional crystallization account for group II. Robinson Crusoe lavas exhibit more radiogenic Pb isotopes (206 Pb/ 204 Pb: 19. 163 - 19. 292) than Alexander Selkirk (206 Pb/ 204 Pb: 18. 939 - 19. 228).

40|$|International audienceThe Crozet Plateau is a 54 Ma-old {{volcanic}} plateau {{that supports}} five islands characterized by recent volcanic manifestations {{that are the}} surface expression of a deep-mantle plume. Due to their remote location and difficult access, the Crozet Islands are poorly sampled. Both the petrological descriptions and geochemical data are scarce. Thus, {{the sources of the}} Crozet plume are still under debate. Similarly, the interactions between the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) and the Crozet plume remain questioned. Here, we present a new set of isotopes (Pb, Sr, Nd and He), major and trace elements data on basalts from three islands of the Crozet Archipelago: Penguins, East, and Possession Islands. Our main purpose is to characterize the sources of the Crozet plume and to test its influence at regional scale. Two groups of lavas can be distinguished based on the isotopic data: East and Possession lavas, and Penguins lavas. Principal component analyses on our high-precision Pb isotopes data and literature data show that two mantle sources can explain most of the geochemical variability measured in Crozet lavas. A third minor contribution is however needed to fully explain the data. The entire set of isotopic compositions (Pb, Sr, Nd and He) can be explained by a mixing between three mantle sources: (1) a FOZO (<b>Focus</b> <b>Zone)</b> component, with 206 Pb/ 204 Pb higher than 19. 5 and high 207 Pb/ 204 Pb, 208 Pb/ 204 Pb 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, 143 Nd/ 144 Nd and R/RaR/Ra (R/Ra=(He 3 /He 4) sample/(He 3 /He 4) atmosphere) ratios, that is mainly sampled Penguins lavas, (2) a component called "East-Possession" that is mostly sampled by the East-Possession lava group and which presents Pb, Sr and Nd isotope signatures {{similar to those of the}} Reunion-Mauritius Islands, and (3) a third minor contribution of the local Depleted MORB Mantle (DMM). The new He isotopes data on the Crozet plume allow us to propose that Crozet plume material is present in the segment of the Southwest Indian Ridge located between the Indomed (ITF) and Gallieni (GTF) transform faults. This hypothesis is confirmed by a mixing model based on trace-elements and isotopes data from the ITF-GTF segment of the SWIR and Crozet. We propose that the shallow mantle below the ITF-GTF segment of the SWIR is contaminated by deep material from the Crozet plume...|$|E
40|$|Intraplate {{magmatism}} provides important {{constraints on}} the evolution, dynamics and composition of the Earth's mantle. Uncertainties remain, however, in understanding the mantle sources related to intraplate magmatism. For example, the influence or existence of mantle stratification, core-mantle interaction and recycling of subducted components are poorly understood. The extent to which geochemical signatures of intraplate magmas are modified during melt transportation, eruption and emplacement also requires better definition. This thesis employs He, O and Re-Os isotope systematics on selected volcanic and intrusive rocks {{from a number of}} oceanic and continental intraplate settings to address some of these key issues. New {{constraints on the}} effect of syn-eruptive degassing and post-emplacement mobility processes on intraplate magmas are presented. Ocean Island Basalts (OIB) from the Western Canary Islands and Coppermine Continental Flood Basalts (CFB) suggest that Re degassing for both modem and ancient alkaline and tholeiitic sub-aerially empted lavas are similar in extent. Crustal contamination is shown to explain some low δ(^ 18) O (≤ 5 %(_ 0) in central Icelandic lavas and low (^ 3) He/'(^ 4) He (50 ppt) Western Canary OIB indicate that recycled oceanic crust forms part of the mantle source for these basalts, a theme also common to low δ(^ 18) O measured in central Icelandic glasses with (^ 3) He/(^ 4) He ratios similar to those of mid ocean ridge basalts. Decoupling of lithophile (Sr, Nd, Pb) and siderophile (Os) isotope tracers from He in both settings provides evidence for (^ 3) He-recharge with (^ 3) He/(^ 4) He up to 11. 8 R(_A) for the Western Canary Islands and 34. 3 R(_A) for central Icelandic lavas. There is evidence in Western Canary Island lavas, and in OIB globally, that a common or 'universal' mantle component is present with a near-chondritic (^ 187) Os/(^ 188) Os (≥ 0. 127), mantle-like δ(^ 18) O (~ 5. 2 %(_ 0)) and elevated (^ 206) Pb/(^ 204) Pb (≥ 19. 1) with respect to the depleted mantle; the so-called FOZO (<b>Focus</b> <b>Zone),</b> PHEM (Primary He mantle), or C (Common) components. Coppermine Re-Os isochron ages (1284 ± 13 Ma) are within error of the accepted 1270 ± 4 Ma U-Pb age for the Muskox Intrusion. γOs initials derived from both the Coppermine CFB (+ 2. 0) and Muskox Intmsion (+ 1. 3) lie on an enstatite or ordinary chondritic Os isotopic evolution curve for the Earth's mantle indicating derivation from a source similar to the universal component recognised in modem-day OIB. These results can be interpreted {{in the context of a}} veined or banded peridotite-pyroxenite mantle. Small amounts of partial melting of a heterogeneous mantle source leads to great isotopic variability whilst larger degrees of partial melting will lead to more homogeneous mantle-derived compositions. Pyroxenite sources might also explain the correlated isotopic and elemental compositions, including the possibility of (^ 186) Os-(^ 187) Os enrichment in OIB through high Re/Os and Pt/Os ratios. Ultimately, a universal mantle component appears to be present in all intraplate magmatism. This universal component is not always related to high (^ 3) He/(^ 4) He and appears to provide an endmember component to all intraplate mantle melting signatures from the Archaean to the present-day.
