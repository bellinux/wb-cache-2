[...] On the subject of branding the Guggenheim, Krens said, [...] "A good brand becomes an article of faith among a consumer audience. [...] <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> BMW or a Mercedes, or stay at a Four Seasons hotel or go the Louvre, you can be pretty much guaranteed a quality experience." [...] During his tenure, Krens has increased the Guggenheim’s endowment to $118 million from $20 million, although he has been known to dip into the endowment to cover operating costs.|$|E

Our course lay along the Valley of the Rhone; which {{is considered one of the}} least beautiful parts of Switzerland, and perhaps for this reason pleased us, as we had not been prepared to expect much. We saw, before reaching the foot of the Alpine pass at Brieg, two rather celebrated Waterfalls; the one the Pissevache, which has no more beauty than any waterfall one hundred or two hundred feet high must necessarily have: the other, near Tourtemagne, is much more pleasing, having foliage round it, and being in a secluded dell. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> Swiss Waterfall, choose this one.|$|E

60|$|In the Chinese bazaar are {{hundreds}} of small shops in which a miscellaneous collection of hardware and dry goods are to be found, and where many things are sold wonderfully cheap. You may buy gimlets at a penny each, white cotton thread at four balls for a halfpenny, and penknives, corkscrews, gunpowder, writing-paper, and many other articles as cheap or cheaper than you can purchase them in England. The shopkeeper is very good-natured; he will show you everything he has, and {{does not seem to}} mind if you buy nothing. He bates a little, but not so much as the Klings, who almost always ask twice what they are willing to take. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> few things from him, he will speak to you afterwards every time you pass his shop, asking you to walk in and sit down, or take a cup of tea; and you wonder how he can get a living where so many sell the same trifling articles.|$|E
6000|$|As to the inns or hotels at Hamburg, I should {{recommend}} you to some German inn. Wordsworth and I {{were at the}} [...] "Der Wilde Man," [...] and dirty as it was, I could not find any inn in Germany very much cleaner, except at Lubec. But {{if you go to}} an English inn, for heaven's sake, avoid the [...] "Shakspeare," [...] at Altona, and the [...] "King of England," [...] at Hamburg. They are houses of plunder rather than entertainment. [...] "The Duke of York" [...] hotel, kept by Seaman, has a better reputation, and thither I would advise you to repair; and I advise you to pay your bill every morning at breakfast time: {{it is the only way}} to escape imposition. What the Hamburg merchants may be I know not, but the tradesmen are knaves. Scoundrels, with yellow-white phizzes, that bring disgrace on the complexion of a bad tallow candle. Now as to carriage, I know scarcely what to advise; only make up your mind to the very worst vehicles, with the very worst horses, drawn by the very worst postillions, over the very worst roads, and halting two hours at each time they change horses, at the very worst inns; and you have a fair, unexaggerated picture of travelling in North Germany. The cheapest way is the best; go by the common post wagons, or stage coaches. What are called extraordinaries, or post-chaises, are little wicker carts, uncovered, with moveable benches or forms in them, execrable in every respect. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> vehicle at Hamburg, you can get none decent under thirty or forty guineas, and very probably it will break to pieces on the infernal roads. The canal boats are delightful, but the porters everywhere in the United Provinces, are an impudent, abominable, and dishonest race. You must carry as little luggage as you well can with you, in the canal boats, and when you land, get recommended to an inn beforehand, and bargain with the porters first of all, and never lose sight of them, or you may never see your portmanteau or baggage again.|$|E

[...] A BYTE writer in January 1983 stated that [...] "of all the business machines at the" [...] Personal Computer World show, the EACA Genie III was [...] "the one that caught my eye.

30|$|Now, {{under the}} {{traditional}} law of one price, all risky positions are worth what one could {{buy or sell}} them for as one can always trade in both directions at the same price. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> something for <b>a</b> price it is worth that price and you receive a value equal to what you paid for it. Similarly, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> sell something for a price the value delivered equals the price. There are no costs associated with risky positions. However, economic analysis may be conducted on replacing the fiction {{of the law of}} one price by that of a two price economy where it is recognized that prices for trading with the market depend on the direction of trade and <b>you</b> have to <b>buy</b> at higher prices than what you can sell for. You do not receive an equal value and the cost of a risky position may be modeled by the spread between the upper and lower valuations. The economic cost of prediction errors may then be taken to be this spread. Importantly, it is useful to note that economic costs are invariant to perturbation by constants as they affect both the upper and lower valuations equally.|$|R
40|$|Visit any modern car {{production}} line {{and you will}} be faced by a showcase of modern technology and advanced logistics combining in a clinical environment to produce rows of automobiles, each significantly different from the one before and after it. From stamping out the sheet steel body to driving a finished car off the line typically takes under 30 hours. However, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> try and <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car to your specification you can expect to wait around 55 days, despite {{production line}}s frequently running below capacity. Why can’t you have your car in 30 hours plus delivery time? The challenge of mass customisation, building cars to customer order, brings great value to both the customer and the automotive industry. Building cars to customer order eliminates the need for companies to hold billions of dollars worth of finished stock. Any company able to free this capital would improve their competitive position and be able to reinvest in future product development. The benefits to all are clear and the first to market an operational build-to-order system will generate a significant cost advantage that may be difficult to emulate. The question for many automotive executives is not when but how exactly will such a radically ‘different’ business model operate? This book addresses the conceptual and practical aspects for achieving the automotive industry’s next goal: the rapid delivery to the customer of a bespoke vehicle only days after placing an order...|$|R

5000|$|As a {{part number}} is an {{identifier}} {{of a part}} design (independent of its [...] ), a serial number is a unique identifier of a particular instantiation of that part design. In other words, a part number identifies any particular (physical) part as being made to that one unique design; a serial number, when used, identifies a particular (physical) part (one physical instance), as differentiated from the next unit that was stamped, machined, or extruded right after it. This distinction is not always clear, as natural language blurs it by typically referring to both part designs, and particular instantiations of those designs, by the same word, [...] "part(s)". Thus <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> muffler of P/N 12345 today, and another muffler of P/N 12345 next Tuesday, you have bought [...] "two copies of the same part", or [...] "two parts", depending on the sense implied.|$|E
50|$|Savings bonds come {{in eight}} denominations: $25, $50, $75, $100, $200, $500, $1,000, and $5,000. After purchase, the holder must wait at least twelve months before cashing it in, {{when they will}} receive the capital plus some interest. The {{maturity}} periods can vary. For example, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> bond with a value of $50 for $25, you'll have to wait at least 17 years to get back your investment from the government, depending on the interest rate. The longer you wait, the greater interest you earn, however savings bonds have a 30-year maximum of interest accrual. After that the bond no longer accrues interest. Savings bonds are protected because they are secured by the U.S. government. The principal and earned interest are registered with the Treasury Department, so if a bond is lost, stolen, or destroyed they can be replaced at no cost. Savings bonds can also have value as a collectible since the government stopped issuing them in paper form.|$|E

Unless, that is, you have at hand the latest (1985) edition of 'Tools for Agriculture'. Developed over the last 20 years, this book is in a class of its own as a 'Buyer's Guide' for Third World agriculture. Although the book is packed with practical information, photos, line drawings and tables you will find it easy to locate the information you require, thanks to the careful thought that has been given to meeting the reader's requirements. Apart from a general updating, this new edition includes much more information on livestock production equipment; and there are new sections on wool harvesting and beekeeping. Ultimately, it is the farmer, together with his advisers, who must make the effective choice of appropriate agricultural equipment.

5000|$|In short, {{the book}} advises the following:1. No {{reliable}} methods exist of speedily accumulating vast riches.2. One's income should exceed one's expenditures. (The book describes elementary methods to preserve one's capital.)3. If one's expenditures exceed one's income, one should determine {{the nature of}} the expenditures and whether they can be foregone with equanimity.4. One should beware of financial advertising. The advertisers and the financial institutions who offer it often have interests that run counter to those of the small investors whom it targets.5. One should put one's first several thousand dollars into an account which is unlikely to lose its nominal value. (The book discusses such accounts. It also discusses bonds, not all of which can be sold indefinitely at par.)6. One should employ tax-sheltered accounts to invest for one's retirement and for advanced academic education of one's progeny.7. One should commit a fixed sum to no-load, low-expense stock index mutual funds every month for the remainder of one's term in the labor market. One should not commit less money than usual after a severe or prolonged market decline. Nor should one commit more money than usual after the market has ascended sharply for years. (The book discusses common stocks, their advantages and hazards as investment media.)8. One cannot reliably achieve higher returns from the stock market than the market average, no matter how much time and effort one devotes to the task. And one can achieve nearly the same return as the market average almost without devoting time or effort to the task by periodically committing a fixed sum to index funds. Therefore, one should make the periodic commitment of one's money and return to one's regular routine.9. One should omit complex, laborious, expensive, unreliable tactics that are alleged by some to enable one to achieve higher returns than the stock market average. (The book discusses an assortment of them and explains why one should not devote much time, effort, or expenditure of money to them.) One should merely periodically commit a fixed sum to index funds.10. Investing in commodies, or coins, stamps, automobiles, collectables, autographs, pictures, art or anything like that is not worth the cost for the amateur investor because of 2 reasons: You are not an expert, so you will probably be <b>buying</b> from <b>an</b> expert. Second, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> at <b>a</b> good price, you will be selling to an expert, and lose money by selling to one. (pg 10)11. Low Price-Earnings stocks beat the market the majority of the time. If all stocks are high PE stocks, wait 6 months for the market to crash.(pg 86)12. Buy stocks that have dividends at least equal to the amount you would find at a bank.(pg 81)13. Only invest money you do not need for the next 5 years, also diversify by not buying all stocks at same time, or with same company. (chapter 5) ...|$|R
