We sampled two long term field trials (8 and 16 years) on silt loam soil, with continuous amendment of dairy <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure</b> (FYM) and 6 types of organic waste (VFG, BIO), municipal solid waste (MSW), sludge (GWS) or organic farm waste (CMC 1, CMC 2) composts. Soil P availability was measured as 0. 01 M CaCl 2 extractable P (P-CaCl 2) and hot water extractable P (HWP) and fresh subsamples were used to conduct a leaching experiment in unsaturated conditions in the laboratory. Since the P fertilization history was not equal among the treatments, P leaching concentrations (TP) were standardized with the total P content of the soil (Ptot). P-CaCl 2, HWP and the P leaching experiment revealed that in long term <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure</b> amended soils, more P becomes available and is susceptible to leaching than in long term VFG, BIO, MSW, CMC 1 and CMC 2 compost amended soils. We observed a seasonal trend in P-CaCl 2 with minimum and maximum at end of winter (February) and mid-summer (July), respectively. Although this trend was independent of the fertilizer type amended on the soil, the P-CaCl 2 significantly increased for <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure</b> amended soil, compared to compost amended soil {{at any time during the}} sampling period of > 1 year.
