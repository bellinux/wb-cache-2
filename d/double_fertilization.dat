The results showed that with different nitrogen intensity treatments, nitrate nitrogen concentration increased firstly and then decreased and leaching concentration peak appeared delay with nitrogen rates increasing. Nitrate nitrogen was the predominant nitrogen leaching form, increase of nitrogen application could postpone nitrogen peak appear time and lead to leaching risk. Ammonium nitrogen leaching loss occurred in the earlier period.

40|$|We {{constructed}} a simulation model for Redfish Lake, Idaho, using water budget and nutrient loading measurements, {{to predict the}} dependence of lake production on nutrients from the watershed, precipitation, lake fertilization, and marine-derived nutrients from sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka, which historically have reared in the lake. We also used the model to simulate different management scenarios to help restore the endangered Snake River sockeye salmon. The model and other empirical evidence indicated that even before hydropower dams {{were present in the}} migration corridor, marine-derived nutrients were not of major importance to lake production, contributing only about 3 % of the annual phosphorus load of the lake. This contribution was partially removed by the quick flushing rate (3 years) of the lake and phosphorus export by smolts. The model predicted annual adult sockeye salmon returns to be 3, 800 fish under predam conditions, 370 fish under modern conditions, 780 fish when watershed nutrient loading was <b>doubled</b> (simulating lake <b>fertilization),</b> and 750 fish when smolt-to-adult survival was <b>doubled.</b> Although <b>fertilization</b> should stimulate sockeye salmon production, the effect would be transitory.

40|$|Meiosis is a {{succession}} of two specialized cell divisions {{that leads to the}} formation of gametes and thereby compensates for genome <b>doubling</b> at <b>fertilization.</b> During the extended prophase of the first meiotic division chromosomes assemble protein cores (axial elements) that attach their ends to the nuclear envelope. These ends transiently gather at a limited sector of the nuclear periphery (bouquet stage) at a time when meiotic recombination is initiated and when chromosomes initiate stable pairing (synapsis). This review discusses novel insights into the relation between recombinational DNA repair and meiotic telomere dynamics that have arrived from recent studies of transchromosomal mice and knockout mice. Analysis of mice deficient for A-type lamins, histone H 2 AX, Suv 39 h HMTases, and the AE protein SYCP 3 suggests that entry into prophase I requires heterochromatin integrity and lamin A expression. Initiation of meiotic telomere clustering represents an early recombination-independent event in first meiotic prophase, while exit from the bouquet stage depends on signals that emanate from the progress of recombinational DNA repair as sensed by ATM kinase and relayed through histone H 2 AX...|$|R

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of parental genomes has attracted much interest because intranuclear chromosome distribution can modulate the transcriptome of cells and influence the efficacy of meiotic homologue pairing. Pairing of parental chromosomes is imperative to sexual reproduction as it translates into homologue segregation and genome haploidization to counteract the genome <b>doubling</b> at <b>fertilization.</b> Differential FISH tagging of parental pericentromeric genome portions and specific painting of euchromatic chromosome arms in Mus musculus (MMU) x Mus spretus (MSP) hybrid spermatogenesis disclosed a phase of homotypic non-homologous pericentromere clustering that led to parental pericentric genome separation from the pre-leptoteneup to zygotene stages. Preferential clustering of MMU pericentromeres correlated with particular enrichment of epigenetic marks (H 3 K 9 me 3), HP 1 -gamma and structural maintenance of chromosomes SMC 6 complex proteins at the MMU major satellite DNA repeats. In contrast to the separation of heterochromatic pericentric genome portions, the euchromatic arms of homeologous chromosomes showed considerable presynaptic pairing already during leptotene stage of all mice investigated. Pericentric genome separation was eventually disbanded by telomere clustering that concentrated both parental pericentric genome portions in a limited nuclear sector of the bouquet nucleus. Our data disclose the differential behavior of pericentromeric heterochromatin and the euchromatic portions of the parental genomes during homologue search.

40|$|Because its {{relevance}} for the sustenance and livelihood of human systems, {{the assessment of}} the impacts that future climatic conditions may have on agricultural productivity becomes a key piece of information for agricultural scientists and policy makers. Several authors have performed assessments of the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity evaluating alternatives for adaptation that are closely related to current management practices and do not cover a wider range of options. The objective {{of this paper is to}} document the main impacts of climate change scenarios on maize productivity in central Chile, an irrigated Mediterranean region, and evaluate the possibility of double cropping as a response to changes in the length of the growing season. The results of this research have lead to the conclusion that maize can be affected by climate change, with yield reductions between 10 % and 30 %, depending on climate change scenario and the type of hybrid used. In addition, climate change will also affect other relevant variables such as the rate of development, allowing the crop to complete its growing cycle in shorter periods of time. In future climate scenarios it is also possible to see a reduction of total irrigation needs, because actual evapotranspiration is diminished. In extreme climate change scenarios, double cropping is a more effective alternative of adaptation compared to management practices such as the use of early sowing dates and reductions in nitrogen <b>fertilization.</b> <b>Double</b> cropping also results in an increase on water demands, nitrogen use, and will likely have an impact on weed, pest and diseases.

40|$|AbstractZebrafish embryos {{have three}} or four {{identifiable}} primary motoneurons per hemisegment. We previously reported that, while several ventral cells initially express the zebrafish Islet- 1 (Isl- 1) gene, a member of the LIM/homeobox gene family, the expression of this gene becomes restricted to a single or a pair of cells slightly anterior to each segment border by 16 hr after <b>fertilization.</b> <b>Double</b> staining by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry strongly suggested that these cells were mainly rostral primary motoneurons. Here, we have isolated two novel zebrafish cDNA clones for more Isl- 1 family genes, termed zfIsl- 2 and zfIsl- 3. zfIsl- 2 mRNA starts to be expressed in the ventral midsegmental cells per hemisegment around 15 hr. Double labeling experiments have shown that these midsegmental cells are the caudal primary motoneuron (CaP) and its variant equivalence pair. Our results revealed the heterogeneity in the expressed genes among primary motoneurons before the fates of the primary motoneurons are irreversibly determined, and further suggest the involvement of the Isl- 1 and zfIsl- 2 genes in the determination of cellular identities by primary motoneurons in embryonic zebrafish. zfIsl- 3 mRNA is not expressed in motoneurons but is expressed at 17 hr, mainly in the ventral myotomes. This suggests that zfIsl- 3 may be involved in the regional specification of the myotome and also in target recognition by CaP. zfIsl- 2 is also expressed throughout the developing eye and tectal region of the midbrain, the target for the retinal axons. In the ventral spinal cord of the spadetail mutant embryo, which has defects in the somites, the cells expressing zfIsl- 2 mRNA significantly decreased in number in contrast to the increase in cells expressing Isl- 1 mRNA, suggesting the influence of the somites on the expression of both genes...|$|R
