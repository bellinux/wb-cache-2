5|$|The scoring started {{early in}} the game as Team Staal's Alexander Ovechkin scored the game's first goal in just 50 seconds into the <b>first</b> <b>period.</b> When he took his first shift Jeff Skinner officially became the {{youngest}} player to play in an All-Star game (18 years, 259 days) surpassing the mark set in 1984 by Steve Yzerman by eight days. By the time Claude Giroux scored, less than five minutes later, Team Staal had opened up a 4–0 lead. Team Lidstrom's Marc-Andre Fleury allowed the four goals on only nine shots while his counterpart Cam Ward stopped the first four shots he faced. The tide turned a little over halfway through the <b>first</b> <b>period</b> when Anze Kopitar scored on a backhand shot. Team Lidstrom completed the <b>first</b> <b>period</b> comeback with under four minutes left in the period when Eriksson and Matt Duchene scored 23 seconds apart to tie the game at four.

5|$|For {{the second}} {{consecutive}} season, the Penguins played the Detroit Red Wings in the Stanley Cup Finals, marking {{the first time in}} 25years that two teams played each other in consecutive Finals. Tickets for Games 3 and 4, which were hosted at Mellon Arena, sold out in 10minutes. In {{the first game of the}} series, the Red Wings scored the first goal when a puck shot by Brad Stuart ricocheted off the boards behind the goal, then bounced off Marc-Andre Fleury and into the net. Ruslan Fedotenko, with an assist from Evgeni Malkin, tied the game before the conclusion of the <b>first</b> <b>period.</b> Detroit went on to score a goal in each of the final two periods to win Game 1, 3–1.

Very low phenotypic correlations of age at first calving with all other traits were observed. The phenotypic, genetic and environmental correlations of first lactation milk yield with 305 day milk yield were high and positive.

Vladimír Šmicer {{required}} treatment for cramp {{towards the end of the}} <b>first</b> <b>period,</b> as a number of Liverpool players felt fatigued. Liverpool had the most of the early exchanges after winning two corners, but could not score. Shortly afterwards, Milan make their final substitution replacing Gennaro Gattuso with Rui Costa. The best chance of the second half came near the end when Shevchenko shot at goal. Dudek saved only for it to rebound back out to Shevchenko, who again shot from under , which Dudek again saved by pushing the shot over the bar. Liverpool had one last chance at the end of extra time, but John Arne Riise's free kick shot was blocked and following this the referee signalled the end of extra time, which meant a penalty shoot-out would decide the championship.|$|E

Consumption of goods and daily demand also increased. The consumption of home appliances greatly increased. Refrigerators increased from a low of 109,000 in 1964 to 440,000 units by 1973; consumption declined during the reversal of the reform. Car production increased, and would continue to do so until the late 1980s. The Soviet leadership, under pressure, sought to provide more attractive goods for Soviet consumers.|$|E
