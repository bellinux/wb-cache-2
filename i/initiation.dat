As well as group attraction, <b>initiations</b> can also produce conformity among new members. Psychology {{experiments have}} also shown that <b>initiations</b> increase feelings of affiliation.|$|R

He pointed out similarities between the first <b>initiation</b> in Metamorphoses and Egyptian afterlife beliefs, saying that the initiate took {{on the role of}} Osiris by undergoing symbolic death. In his view, the imagery of the <b>initiation</b> refers to the Egyptian underworld, the Duat. Griffiths argued that the sun {{in the middle of the}} night, in Lucius' account of the <b>initiation,</b> might have been influenced by the contrasts of light and dark in other mystery rites, but it derived mainly from the depictions of the underworld in ancient Egyptian funerary texts. According to these texts, the sun god Ra passes through the underworld each night and unites with Osiris to emerge renewed, just as deceased souls do.|$|E

40|$|A {{script that}} was {{systematically}} faded from end to beginning {{was used to}} teach peer <b>initiations</b> about recently completed, current, and future activities. The effectiveness of the script-fading procedure was assessed via a multiple baseline design across 4 children with autism. During baseline, the children seldom initiated to peers, although all had previously acquired some functional expressive language and sometimes spontaneously addressed adults. When the script was introduced, peer <b>initiations</b> increased, and as the script was faded, unscripted <b>initiations</b> increased. With the minimal written prompts available in the final fading steps, <b>initiations</b> generalized to a different setting, time, teacher, and activity; and for 3 of the 4 children, peer <b>initiations</b> were maintained at a 2 -month follow-up. After the script was faded, the participants' levels of peer <b>initiations</b> were within the same range as a normative sample of 3 nondisabled youngsters. The script-fading procedure enabled children with severe social and verbal deficits to practice context-specific, peer-directed generative language that was not prompted by adults or peer confederates...|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{critical}} issue for multicentre clinical studies is conducting site <b>initiations,</b> ensuring sites {{are trained in}} study procedures and comply with relevant governance requirements before they begin recruiting patients. How technology can support site <b>initiations</b> has not previously been explored. Objective: This study sought to evaluate use of off-the-shelf web based videoconferencing to deliver site <b>initiations</b> for a large national multicentre study. Methods: Participants in the <b>initiations,</b> including podiatrists, diabetologists, trial co-ordinators, and research nurses, completed an online questionnaire based on the System Usability Scale (SUS) (N= 15). This was followed by semi-structured interviews, with a consultant diabetologist, a trial coordinator, and three research nurses, exploring perceived benefits and limitations of videoconferencing. Results: The mean SUS score for the videoconferencing platform was 87. 2 (SD = 13. 7), suggesting a good level of usability. Interview participants perceived <b>initiations</b> delivered by videoconferencing as being more interactive and easier to follow than those delivered by teleconference. In comparison to face-to-face <b>initiations,</b> videoconferencing takes less time, easily fitting in {{with the work of}} staff at the local sites. Perceptions of impact on communication varied according to the hardware used. Conclusion: Off-the-shelf videoconferencing is a viable alternative to face-to-face site <b>initiations</b> and confers advantages over teleconferencing...|$|R
40|$|Flash <b>initiations</b> {{within a}} {{supercell}} cluster during 10 – 11 May 2010 in Oklahoma were investigated based on observations from the Oklahoma Lightning Mapping Array and the Norman, Oklahoma, polarimetric radar (KOUN). The flash <b>initiations</b> at positions dominated by graupel, dry snow, small hail and crystals accounted for 44. 3 %, 44. 1 %, 8. 0 % and 3. 0 % {{of the total}} flashes, respectively. During the tornadic stage of the southern supercell in the cluster, flash <b>initiations</b> associated with graupel occupied the main body, the right flank and the forward flank of the supercell, while those associated with dry snow dominated {{the outskirts of the}} adjacent forward anvil, right anvil and rear anvil. The flash <b>initiations</b> associated with small hail were concentrated around the main updraft, particularly toward its front side. Highly dense flash <b>initiations</b> were located in the regions overlying the differential reflectivity (ZDR) arc and right anvil. The average initial height of the flashes decreased gradually from the rear to the front and from the right to the left flanks, while the height range over which <b>initiations</b> occurred reached a maximumat the front of the updraft. The flashes that were initiated in the adjacent forward anvils were largest on average, followed by those in the regions ahead of the updraft and near the ZDR arc. This study supports the concept of charge pockets and further deduces that the pockets in the right anvil are the most abundant and compact due to the frequent flash <b>initiations,</b> small-sized flashes and thin layers including flash <b>initiations...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{general purpose}} of the current study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of minimally intrusive prompting procedures and preferred stimuli on protodeclarative joint attention <b>initiations</b> in children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Two boys and one girl diagnosed with ASD participated. The experimenter provided attention and social interaction following protodeclarative <b>initiations</b> throughout all phases of the study. During intervention, a model prompt was delivered every 30 s if the participant failed to initiate a bid for joint attention. Results for the first participant show that a model prompt was sufficient to increase the rate of protodeclarative <b>initiations</b> across stimulus sets. Generalization was seen across sets, but not across environments. Subsequently, the model prompt was sufficient to increase the rate of protodeclarative <b>initiations</b> across sets in a second setting (classroom). Results for the second participant are inconclusive. Data collected during the initial baseline condition show that she engaged in an incompatible verbal response across sets. When pictorial stimuli depicting highinterest items and activities were introduced, the rate of protodeclarative <b>initiations</b> increased over time. We then returned to original baseline condition and saw an initial decrease, followed by a steady increase in the rate of protodeclarative <b>initiations.</b> The third participant withdrew prematurely due to medical reasons. The findings of the current study show that minimally intrusive prompts and natural consequences may be sufficient to establish protodeclarative <b>initiations</b> in children. However, this finding may be limited to only those children for whom social interactions already function as reinforcers...|$|R

5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} organisms, pre-mRNA is transcribed in the nucleus, introns are spliced out, {{then the}} mature mRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The small subunit of the ribosome usually starts by binding to {{one end of}} the mRNA and is joined there by various other eukaryotic <b>initiation</b> factors, forming the <b>initiation</b> complex. The <b>initiation</b> complex scans along the mRNA strand until it reaches a start codon, and then the large subunit of the ribosome attaches to the small subunit and translation of a protein begins. This entire process is referred to as gene expression; it is the process by which the information in a gene, encoded as a sequence of bases in DNA, is converted into the structure of a protein. A Morpholino can modify splicing or block translation, depending on the Morpholino's base sequence.|$|E
