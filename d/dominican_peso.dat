25|$|With {{the nation}} {{on the brink of}} defaulting, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands sent {{warships}} to Santo Domingo to press the claims of their nationals. In order to preempt military intervention, United States president Theodore Roosevelt introduced the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, declaring that the United States would assume responsibility for ensuring that the nations of Latin America met their financial obligations. In January 1905, under this corollary, the United States assumed administration of the Dominican Republic's customs. Under the terms of this agreement, a Receiver-General, appointed by the U.S. President, kept 55% of total revenues to pay off foreign claimants, while remitting 45% to the Dominican government. After two years, the nation's external debt was reduced from $40 million to $17 million. In 1907, this agreement was converted into a treaty, transferring control over customs receivership to the U.S. Bureau of Insular Affairs and providing a loan of $20 million from a New York bank as payment for outstanding claims, making the United States the Dominican Republic's only foreign creditor. In 1905, the <b>Dominican</b> <b>Peso</b> was replaced by the U.S. Dollar.|$|E

5000|$|Administration of {{resources}} and priorities In order to provide adequate and appropriate technical and technological resources, the Attorney General needed a significant budget boost. The allocation that Francisco Dominguez got for 2005 doubled the previous year (reaching 1.100 million <b>Dominican</b> <b>pesos).</b> Due to its marked deterioration and the deplorable conditions, he was motivated to transform the penitentiary system through an accelerated renovation of the prisons, the so-called [...] "new model prison." [...] In the first stage, nine of the 35 prisons in the country were incorporated into the new model. To think that the Office of the country's prison system just received 16% (110 million <b>Dominican</b> <b>pesos)</b> of the total country's budget in 2006; {{after two years of}} priority, spending had increased to 34% (509 million <b>Dominican</b> <b>pesos).</b>|$|R

50|$|Although {{there are}} {{substantial}} upper class {{and middle class}} segments in the Dominican Republic, the country also has a high poverty rate, so that since the 1970s economic reasons have rampantly driven emigration. Overall, between 1966 and 2002 119,000 Dominicans were legally admitted to Puerto Rico, while many thousands arrived illegally. Most emigrants, however, have been far from destitute, as {{they tend to be}} jobholders in the Dominican Republic, many in skilled occupations such as mechanic, mason, seamstress, and nurse. These migrants have been attracted by Puerto Rico's higher wages, which have generally tended to rise in relation to Dominican wages since the early 1980s, when an era of frequent devaluation of the <b>Dominican</b> <b>peso</b> began. Economic crises that beset the Dominican Republic in the 1980s further increased emigration. Despite strong economic growth, the 1990s marked the peak in Dominican emigration, due to high income inequality. Severe economic crisis hit in 2003-2004, again causing a surge in emigration.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the Dominican economy is the Free Trade Zone industry (FTZ), which made up U.S. $4.55 billion in Dominican exports for 2006 (70% of total exports). Reports show, however, that the FTZs lost approximately 60,000 between 2005 and 2007 and suffered a 4% decrease in total exports in 2006. The textiles sector experienced an approximate 17% drop in exports {{due in part to the}} appreciation of the <b>Dominican</b> <b>peso</b> against the dollar, Asian competition following expiration of the quotas of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, and a government-mandated increase in salaries, which should have occurred in 2005 but was postponed to January 2006. Lost Dominican business was captured by firms in Central America and Asia. The tobacco, jewelry, medical, and pharmaceutical sectors in the FTZs all reported increases for 2006, which somewhat offset textile and garment losses. Industry experts from the FTZs expected that entry into force of the CAFTA-DR agreement will promote substantial growth in the FTZ sector for 2007.|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} measures {{the role of}} exchange rate changes in explaining variations of sugar and rice trade. As background for this research, monetary, fiscal, and exchange rate policies of the Dominican Republic since 1970 are reviewed. The theoretical framework describing the relationship between exchange rate changes and sugar and rice trade has been tested empirically using the Dominican Republic 2 ̆ 7 s annual data {{for the period of}} 1970 - 1987. Regression analyses on the import of rice and export of sugar are estimated. The regression results conform with the expectation that exchange rate variance is most influential for rice import demand and less so for sugar export demand. That is to be expected because the trade environment for sugar is more restricted by noneconomic conditions than the trade environment for rice. The estimated exchange rate elasticity for rice import demand is 1. 92, while for sugar export demand it averages 0. 098 in the short run and 0. 242 in the long run. Export volume is relatively insensitive to changes in the U. S price for Caribbean sugar but is responsive to changes in the real exchange rate. Empirical results of this research also indicate that the import demand for rice is highly sensitive to the gross domestic product but less responsive to changes in domestic rice production and exchange rates. The monetary and fiscal policies review shows that the Dominican government has consistently followed an expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. Over time monetary expansion and increasing government expenditures have resulted in an increasing exchange rate with predicable change in Dominican exports and imports including sugar (exports) and rice (imports), therefore having some effect on sugar and rice trade as well. Dramatic depreciation of the <b>Dominican</b> <b>peso</b> {{in the past three years}} relative to the first 15 years of the data period suggests that further research and reestimation of the link o f monetary and fiscal policies to exchange rates and commodity trade should be done as the data are available to support them...|$|E
