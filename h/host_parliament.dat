50|$|During {{this early}} {{building}} period, {{there was a}} risk that Parliament Hill Fields (the southernmost part of Hampstead Heath, entered from the ‘Gospel Oak Entrance’ near Gospel Oak station) would be built over. In the 1840s, Lord Southampton’s estate initially proposed building on the fields, but a campaign led to the fields being bought in 1889 by the Metropolitan Board of Works as an extension to the already protected Hampstead Heath. The fields now <b>host</b> <b>Parliament</b> Hill itself, the Parliament Hill Lido, an athletics running track, a bandstand, café and various children’s play areas.|$|E

50|$|The {{opposition}} of Shaftesbury had rendered the two Parliaments summoned in 1679 quite unmanageable by the court. The King determined {{to hold a}} new Parliament in Oxford in 1681, hoping {{to draw on the}} city's traditional royalist loyalties. Norreys and John Fell, who had been the court's managers in the previous two elections, were entrusted with the preparations for holding the new Parliament. Fell managed to arrange a truce between Norreys and Lord Lovelace, the principal Whig electioneer in the borough, while Norreys took care of the logistical details of <b>hosting</b> <b>Parliament.</b> Happily for him, the management of Parliament was one of the responsibilities of the Lord Great Chamberlain, who was his eldest half-brother, Lord Lindsey. The elections to the Oxford Parliament did not prove any more favorable to the court party than those preceding, but Norreys played out his role as Lord Lieutenant and host, leading a troop of horse to escort the King from the border of Oxfordshire to the Parliament. Norreys also took the somewhat daring step of presenting a petition to the Lords for the bail of Danby, still languishing in the Tower; opinion was divided, and the matter was put aside for a few days on the suggestion of Lord Halifax. It was not taken up again: a secret treaty with France had relieved the King's need for supply, and a popular reaction against the Whigs had begun to grow. Charles was disinclined to wrangle with another Exclusionist parliament and abruptly dissolved it after a week.|$|R
25|$|The term ban {{is still}} {{used in the}} phrase banski dvori ("ban's court") for the {{buildings}} that host high government officials.

The building known as Bela banovina ("the white banovina") in Novi Sad <b>hosts</b> the <b>parliament</b> and government of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina in Serbia. The building received this name because it previously hosted the administration of Danube Banovina (1929–1941). Banovina is also the colloquial name of the city hall building in Split, and of the administrative building (rectorate and library) of the University of Niš.|$|R
