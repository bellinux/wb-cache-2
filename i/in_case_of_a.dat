This would be used if the platform is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. A hyperbaric lifeboat may be self-propelled and can be operated by crew while the while the occupants are under pressure.

5|$|By now the pre-war {{electrification}} scheme {{had been}} revived. In 1957 electrification between Rickmansworth and Amersham and Chesham began. Chalfont& Latimer's platforms were extended {{and a second}} platform was opened at Chesham on 3 July 1960 to prevent through operations to and from Baker Street from interfering with the Chesham–Chalfont& Latimer shuttle. An electric service using London Underground T Stock began operations between Chesham and Chalfont& Latimer on 16 August 1960, with former MR electric locomotives hauling the through trains to and from London. A steam locomotive was kept on standby in the new second platform at Chesham, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> failure of the electric trains. From June 1962 both the T Stock and the locomotive-hauled trains were replaced by the newly introduced London Underground A Stock.|$|E
5|$|Following Oppenheimer's {{reorganization}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory in July 1944, {{the work on the}} uranium gun-type weapon was concentrated in Francis Birch's O-1 (Gun) Group. The concept was pursued so that <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> failure to develop an implosion bomb, at least the enriched uranium could be used. Henceforth the gun-type had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted, one short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay. The new design was called Little Boy.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon and the plutonium gun-type fission weapon, the uranium gun-type weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design. The concept was pursued so that <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> failure to develop a plutonium bomb, {{it would still be}} possible to use the gun principle. The gun-type design henceforth had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified.

5|$|Interest in Banak {{rose with}} the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948 {{and fears of}} Soviet {{intervention}} in Norway. Finnmark, located on the Norway–Soviet Union border, became of particular interest for the military. Although specific plans were articulated, no construction of an airbase was carried out. However, Norway's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 had a dramatic effect on the military strategy and Banak. Finnmark {{was regarded as a}} tripwire and was to be sacrificed <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Soviet invasion. The airfield was closed in 1952, but the runway remained, consisting of a short section of unmaintained wooden runway and the rest a grass strip. It was occasionally used by small aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Involvement in the Spanish Civil War {{had drawn}} Mussolini closer to Hitler, helping to get Mussolini's {{agreement}} for Hitler's plans for union (Anschluss) with Austria.

Hitler's need to prevent an Italian invasion was settled with the Rome-Berlin Axis, partway into the Spanish Civil War.|$|E

5|$|John of Antioch and the Patriarch Nikephoros both {{report that}} Heraclius the Elder {{maintained}} correspondence with Priscus, the Count of the Excubitors and former {{commander of the}} army. By that time, Priscus was the son-in-law of Phocas but reportedly held a grudge against the emperor. He allegedly promised Heraclius the Elder support <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rebellion and confirmed it once the rebellion had started. The story is somewhat suspect. While there was major dissension in Constantinople and Priscus did in time defect to Heraclius the Elder, {{there is nothing to}} suggest that Priscus helped incite the revolt. Patriarch Nikephoros reports that Heraclius the Elder held council with his brother Gregoras before proclaiming his revolt, possibly indicating that Gregoras was acting as his advisor. He also reports that Gregoras hoped to promote his own son Nicetas to the throne, although this is considered unlikely at best by modern historians.|$|E
5|$|Khalid {{utilized}} {{his better}} understanding of terrain in every possible way to gain strategic superiority over his enemies. During his Persian campaigns, he initially never entered deep into Persian territory and always kept the Arabian desert at his rear, allowing his forces to retreat there <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> defeat. It was only after all the strong Persian and Persian-allied forces were routed that he penetrated deep into Euphrates region and captured the regional capital of Iraq, Al-Hira. Again, at Yarmouk, the terrain would help him in executing his grand strategy of annihilating the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|Most {{planning}} {{focused on}} the first phase, which {{was seen as the}} most critical. This phase involved construction of defence works for Singapore. For the second phase, a naval base capable of supporting a fleet was required. While the United States had constructed a graving dock capable of taking battleships at Pearl Harbor between 1909 and 1919, the Royal Navy had no such base east of Malta. In April 1919, the Plans Division of the Admiralty produced a paper which examined possible locations for a naval base in the Pacific <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> war with the United States or Japan. Hong Kong was considered but regarded as too vulnerable, while Sydney was regarded as secure but too far from Japan. Singapore emerged as the best compromise location.|$|E

5|$|On November 15, {{near the}} end of the Battle of Shanghai, Chiang Kai-shek convened a meeting of the Military Affairs Commission's Supreme National Defense Council to {{undertake}} strategic planning, including a decision on what to do <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Japanese attack on Nanking. Here Chiang insisted fervently on mounting a sustained defense of Nanking. Chiang argued, just as he had during the Battle of Shanghai, that China would be more likely to receive aid from the great powers, possibly at the ongoing Nine Power Treaty Conference, if it could prove on the battlefield its will and capacity to resist the Japanese. He also noted that holding onto Nanking would strengthen China's hand in peace talks which he wanted the German ambassador Oskar Trautmann to mediate.|$|E
5|$|Since Apollo, like Mercury, {{would require}} a launch escape system (LES) <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> launch failure, a {{relatively}} small rocket was required for qualification flight testing of this system. A size bigger than the NAA Little Joe would be required, so the Little Joe II was built by General Dynamics/Convair. After an August 1963 qualification test flight, four LES test flights (A-001 through 004) were made at the White Sands Missile Range between May 1964 and January 1966.|$|E
5|$|The dwindling {{credibility}} of the massive retaliation strategy caused NATO to shift to the flexible response strategy. This increased the importance of Banak, {{as it would be}} used to fly in reinforcements in a war situation. In 1962, both RNoAF and NATO proposed that Banak be expanded to full NATO standards. RNoAF planned that Banak should host a detachment of up to six fighters or fighter-bombers and act as a stopover for fighters, transports and helicopters. The airfield was to stockpile supplies, including fuel and ammunition, for one month of war efforts. NATO saw need, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Soviet attack on Finnmark, to deploy two brigades consisting of 10,000 men {{in the course of a}} week and simultaneously host a squadron of tactical aircraft.|$|E
