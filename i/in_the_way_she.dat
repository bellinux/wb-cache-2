25|$|Lewis {{was unique}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> {{approached}} sculpting abroad. She insisted on enlarging her clay and wax models in marble herself, rather than hire native Italian sculptors {{to do it}} for her, which was the common practice. Male sculptors were largely skeptical of the talent of female sculptors, and often accused them of not doing their own work. Harriet Hosmer, a fellow sculptor and expatriate, also did this. Lewis also was known to make sculptures before receiving commissions for them, or sent unsolicited works to Boston patrons requesting that they raise funds for materials and shipping.|$|E

25|$|The Beard is a notably {{controversial}} modern play, that {{explores the}} nature of seduction and attraction, as it portrays an explosive confrontation between two legendary figures, Jean Harlow, the platinum blonde movie star, and Billy the Kid, the baby-faced outlaw with a hair trigger. They are attracted to each other, but their egos get <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>She</b> mocks his masculinity, and he tells her she is envious of his beauty. This battle diminishes as they realize that since they are alone together {{they are free to}} shuck their burdening facades, and give in to what they’re truly feeling. The torrent of their unleashed passions leads to a final scene of great controversy, as the play comes to a climax with an act of explicit sexual intimacy between the cowboy and the starlet.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, O'Keeffe {{began her}} serious formal art {{training}} at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and then the Art Students League of New York, but she felt constrained by her lessons that focused on recreating or copying what was in nature. In 1908, unable to fund further education, she worked for two years as a commercial illustrator, and then spent seven years between 1911 and 1918 teaching in Virginia, Texas, and South Carolina. During that time, she studied art during the summers between 1912 and 1914 and {{was introduced to the}} principles and philosophies of Arthur Wesley Dow, who espoused created works of art based upon personal style, design, and interpretation of subjects, rather than trying to copy or represent them. This caused a major change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> felt about and approached art, as seen in the beginning stages of her watercolors from her studies at the University of Virginia and more dramatically in the charcoal drawings that she produced in 1915 that led to total abstraction. Alfred Stieglitz, an art dealer and photographer, held an exhibit of her works in 1916. Over the next couple of years, she taught and continued her studies at the Teachers College, Columbia University.|$|E

500|$|Harrison was {{inspired}} to write [...] "Something" [...] during sessions for the White Album by listening to label-mate James Taylor's [...] "Something <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>She</b> Moves" [...] from his album James Taylor.

In her 2007 autobiography, , Boyd recalls: [...] "He told me, in a matter-of-fact way, that he had written it for me. I thought it was beautiful..."

[...] Edginer agreed, commenting that despite {{the small size of}} the novel compared to other popular books, When You Reach Me is a [...] "taut novel, every word, every sentence, has meaning and substance."

500|$|Racism, an {{important}} theme {{in all of}} Angelou's autobiographies, continues {{to be important in}} this book, but she has matured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> deals with it in Traveling Shoes. [...] For the first time in Angelou's life, she [...] "does not feel threatened by racial hate" [...] in Ghana. [...] She finds a strong support system there, and as Hagen states, she [...] "has come far from the mute, shy little girl of Stamps, Arkansas". [...] As Hagen states, Angelou [...] "is not yet ready to toss off the stings of prejudice, but tolerance and even a certain understanding can be glimpsed". [...] This is demonstrated in Angelou's treatment of the [...] "genocidal involvement of Africans in slave-trading", something that is often overlooked or misrepresented by other Black writers.

500|$|Catherine {{was unable}} to control Henry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> had Francis and Charles. Her role in his {{government}} became that of chief executive and roving diplomat. She travelled widely across the kingdom, enforcing his authority and trying to head off war. In 1578, she took {{on the task of}} pacifying the south. At the age of fifty-nine, she embarked on an eighteen-month journey around the south of France to meet Huguenot leaders face to face. Her efforts won Catherine new respect from the French people. On her return to Paris in 1579, she was greeted outside the city by the Parlement and crowds. The Venetian ambassador, Gerolamo Lipomanno, wrote: [...] "She is an indefatigable princess, born to tame and govern a people as unruly as the French: they now recognize her merits, her concern for unity and are sorry not to have appreciated her sooner." [...] She was under no illusions, however. On 25 November 1579, she wrote to the king, [...] "You are {{on the eve of a}} general revolt. Anyone who tells you differently is a liar." ...|$|E
500|$|Marlohe {{expanded}} on Sévérine's personality {{beyond what}} {{was written in}} the screenplay. She said she added a feeling of [...] "raziness" [...] to the character, partially basing it on Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker in the 2008 film The Dark Knight. She also thought more critically about Sévérine's relationship with Silva, saying: [...] "I just built everything with my imagination, and that is very exciting, too, because there's room for accidents on set." [...] GMA Network's Mikhail Lecaros wrote that Marlohe approached the character with a [...] "bemused cynicism". Daniel Craig praised Marlohe's approach to the character, saying she [...] "brought a huge amount of depth to what is essentially a very small part" [...] and [...] "gave her an awful lot of history <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> played it". He added that he felt her preparation made the scenes easier to act, and would make the interactions between Bond and Sévérine more appealing to the audience. While discussing her working relationship with Craig, Marlohe described him as [...] "funny, very humble...".|$|E

[...] Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave the film 3.5/5 stars and lauded its lead performances: [...] "If Abhay is the anchor of the group, Farhan's funster role is full of beans and Hrithik's metamorphosis from uptight, money-minded stock broker to carefree vagabond is a class act." ...|$|E
500|$|Also in Traveling Shoes, Angelou came {{to terms}} with her {{difficult}} past, both as a descendent of Africans taken forcibly to America as slaves and as an African America who had experienced racism. [...] As she told an interviewer, she brought her son to Ghana {{to protect him from}} the negative effects of racism because she did not think he had the tools to withstand them. For the first time in Angelou's life, she did not [...] "feel threatened by racial hate" [...] in Ghana. The theme of racism was still an important theme in Traveling Shoes, but she has matured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> dealt with it.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{producer}} Eric Buchman, while filmmaker Michael Grossman directed it. Buchman explained how his main concept for the episode was to describe O'Malley's grieving {{in a different way}} than depicted for Stevens, but in a manner that would be both bothering to her and painful for his partner, Torres. However, he stated that Torres' emotional state during the mourning was also significant to the episode: [...] "We wanted Callie to feel some remorse. She finally got George, but not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> wanted. She's gotten his body, but the underlying relationship isn't there anymore." [...] Buchman disclosed that one of the story lines he had originally intended to include in the scrip was Yang and Burke's cold relationship being [...] "kept alive" [...] by having silent sex, which ultimately did not occur, due to being looked upon as [...] "boring, neither dramatic, nor comedic", and also as not being descriptive of the character's feelings. The story line involving the four attending physicians fighting for the title of chief of surgery, was described by Buchman as a comic relief, used to emphasize a childish side of the characters' personalities which had not been previously developed. In addition, Buchman described Webber's retirement as an attempt to reconcile with his estranged wife, but leads to emotional devastation at the realization that she had moved on with a different man.|$|E
