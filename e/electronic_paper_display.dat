5000|$|The {{flexible}} <b>electronic</b> <b>paper</b> <b>display</b> technology co-developed by Arizona State University and HP {{employs a}} manufacturing process developed by HP Labs called Self-Aligned Imprint Lithography (SAIL). The screens {{are made by}} layering stacks of semi-conductor materials and metals between pliable plastic sheets. The stacks need to be perfectly aligned and stay that way. Alignment proves difficult during manufacturing when heat during manufacturing can deform the materials and when the resulting screen also needs to remain flexible. The SAIL process gets around this by ‘printing’ the semiconductor pattern on a fully composed substrate, so that the layers always remain in perfect alignment. The limitation of the material the screen is based on allows only a finite amount of full rolls, hence limiting its commercial application as a flexible display.

40|$|The developmet of {{flexible}} display technology has made considerable progress in recent years. The recent development promises and opens up new applications for displays {{which do not}} exist today. This type of applications includes various potential products, such as an electronic newspaper, a large wall screen that could be rolled away when not in use, a television in tapestry, a PDA that could be rolled up into a pen, etc. The technology {{of flexible}} displays is not yet sufficiently developed to enable the use of those applications. Many flexible display prototypes have been already developed, {{but they have not}} sufficient properties for successful use in mass production at the moment. The main problem is the lack of flexibility, which is strongly restricted due to non-organic materials, which consist of a flexible display. This leds to a variety of defects upon bending, which limit the functionality or even destroy the display. To this end, it will be necessarily to develop alternative materials which will enable a good display flexibility.

40|$|Ankara : The Department of Physics and the Graduate School of Engineering and Science of Bilkent University, 2015. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Bilkent University, 2015. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 86 - 95. Graphene, a {{two dimensional}} crystal of carbon atoms, {{emerges as a}} viable material for optoelectronics because of its electrically-tunable broadband optical properties. Optical response of graphene at visible and near infrared frequencies is defined by inter-band electronic transitions. By electrical tuning of the Fermi energy, the inter-band transitions can be blocked due to Pauli blocking. However, controlling inter-band transitions of graphene in the visible and near infrared wavelengths, has been an outstanding challenge. We developed a new device to control optical properties of graphene in the visible spectra. Our device relies on a graphene supercapacitor which includes two parallel graphene electrodes and electrolyte between them. Mutual gating between graphene electrodes enables us to fabricate optical modulators which can operate in the visible and near-infrared. Single layer graphene, however, has performance limits due to its small optical absorption defined by fundamental constants. We extend our method and we developed {{a new class of}} electrochromic devices using multilayer graphene. Fabricated devices undergo a reversible color change with the electrically controlled intercalation process. The electrical and optical characterizations of the electrochromic devices reveal the broadband optical modulation up to 55 per cent in the visible and near-infrared. Integration of semiconducting materials on unconventional substrates enables optoelectronic devices with new mechanical functionalities that cannot be achieved with wafer-based technologies. As a novel application, we demonstrate ultra thin <b>electronic</b> <b>paper</b> <b>displays</b> using the multilayer graphene as a reconfigurable optical medium. We anticipate that the developed devices would find wide range of applications in optoelectronics. Polat, Emre OzanPh. D...|$|R

Up to now, several strategies such as blade coating [6, 8, 9], ink-jet printing [10, 11], gravure printing [12, 13], and the recently emerged spraying technologies [14 – 16] have been proved to be efficient methods for the fabrication of electronic devices. Among these methods, spray coating has been investigated intensively due to its unique advantage in manufacturing. Through the spray-coating method, various materials with low solubility in less toxic solvent can be applied due to the requirement of a low solution concentration [17]. Moreover, spray coating makes it possible with higher speed of production and better compatibility to various substrates [18], and the different shapes of film can be patterned through shadow masks [19]. Additionally, compared to other methods, such as spin casting, blade coating, and gravure printing, the spray-coating process can realize a continuous film without damaging the bottom layer of the device: just simply control the solvent content, droplet size, and solidification dynamics.|$|R

40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>paper</b> <b>display</b> (EPD) {{has reached}} a {{position}} of great maturity. Due to its capability of bistability and great reflectivity, it can display an image without any flowing current. Today, sensors and regulators are being placed out to monitor the real world, and are often battery powered without a display. With the introduction of electronic paper displays, these units can be given a display without {{a significant increase in}} power. There is however still very limited power available, and power reduction is considered increasingly important. A theoretical and practical analysis of EPD, Thin-Film Transistor, and level shifters have been used to investigate power reduction techniques. The area of interest is the sub-circuits where level shifters are adopted. These sub-circuits typically carry over 60 % of the total power consumption during an electronic paper write cycle. Practical experiments and simulations have been used to find new power saving level shifters for these sub-circuits. The simulations have been successfully used to show different level shifters performing and running at two different frequencies (10 MHz and 2 Hz) using commercially available 180 nm technology. The results from the simulations in Cadence Virtuoso have shown that the proposed circuits perform about 80 % - 85 % better in terms of power at high frequency (10 MHz). The results also show that the proposed circuits perform about 65 % - 150 % worse in terms of power at low frequency (2 Hz). From the results, we have concluded that the proposed circuits are not better in low-frequency applications such as electronic paper displays. However storage capacitors can be added to electronic paper pixels which can potentially speed up the scan process, thereby making these results more applicable...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{development}} {{of technology in}} the health-care sector {{has led to the}} discovery of many new illnesses and improved treatments that were not possible earlier. However, many treatments and medicines for a specific disease often come with several side effects. The accuracy in treatments with an optimal result on specified targets is therefore desired with minimum side effects. This requires that the production and the usage processes should be precise. The scope of this study is not about the medicine production phase but rather on managing a medicine schedule. How many times a medicine should be taken in a day is strongly related to its dosage and following a precise timing plays {{a crucial role in the}} individual’s health. As a solution, a pill box based on a low power display (<b>Electronic</b> <b>Paper</b> <b>Display,</b> EPD) together with an embedded system has been introduced by the project owner (Victrix AB, Stockholm). The pill box should have some different functions like alarms, data logging and wireless reporting. Different types of alarms including ringtone, vibration and voice recording/playing are required as well. To be able to trace the already planned timing for taking medicines, system will be able to save and report history of the past 100 days. Since every single idea for solving different parts of the problem should be tested in real system, a Quantitative Research based on experiments be used and the best possible solution be selected and implemented in the project. Studying technical material and also related works besides analyzing generated data after each experiment were a useful tool for the system integration in this work. As the result, a pill box based on an embedded system was designed and integrated successfully. A hardware platform, in form of a prototype system based on an ARM microcontroller and a compatible embedded software have been designed, improved and tested successfully and are available. At the end of this work, the low power E-paper display works properly, alarms can be set and activated, data can be saved and also sent wirelessly. Basically, the result of this project shows how an embedded system can be specialized and programmed to be able to interact with patients and e. g. nurses in order to make a stable and continuous connection between them. Most of determined goals have been achieved and some of them be changed and modified during the work. Also a few additional functions and improvements be suggested as future work...|$|E
40|$|A particle-based display {{medium and}} a driving {{mechanism}} {{insensitive to the}} charge polarity of those particles, based on the transformation of particle chains, are developed for reflective <b>electronic</b> <b>paper</b> <b>displays.</b> Particle chains are formed by dipole–dipole interactions between polarized particles with an appropriate electric field applied across the tested display medium, i. e. the solution that regulates {{the light in the}} field of display technology, containing neutral polystyrene (PS) particles dispersed in water. Formation of the particle chains results in a large change in optical transmittance and reflectance of the display medium. The performance of the particle chain displays (PCD) was evaluated according to macroscopic (device), microscopic (particle) and optical (reflectance) points of view. A display medium (thickness 100 mm) containing colored PS particles (3 mm, 2. 5 % w/v) was polarized to display the fixed images of the directly driven electrodes and programmable images of arrayed (5 6 5) electrodes with electric fields (0. 48 MV m 21 and 0. 09 MV m 21, 500 kHz, respectively). The formation of particle chains under electric fields (0. 2 MV m 21 and 0. 4 MV m 21, 500 kHz) was observed in the microscopic images of a display medium (thickness 100 mm) with fluorescent PS particles (5 mm, 1 %). Images recorded with a confocal microscope demonstrated the particle chains. The opacity, a common parameter serving to characterize a display medium, was derived by measuring the reflectance ratio of a black background to a white background of the display medium with varied thickness and particle concentration. The temporal response of a display medium (thickness 50 mm) with black PS particles (3 mm, 5 %) was tested. When an electric field (0. 6 MV m 21, 500 kHz) was applied, the reflectance increased twice at the first data point in 0. 7 s, attaining a contrast ratio of 2. Application of a voltage (20 s) yielded a contrast ratio of 10.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{new forms of}} {{electronic}} devices such as <b>electronic</b> <b>papers,</b> flexible <b>displays,</b> epidermal sensors, and smart textiles have become reality. Thin-film transistors (TFTs) are the basic blocks of the circuits used in such devices and need to operate above 100 [*]MHz to efficiently treat signals in RF systems and address pixels in high resolution displays. Beyond {{the choice of the}} semiconductor, i. e., silicon, graphene, organics, or amorphous oxides, the junctionless nature of TFTs and its geometry imply some limitations which become evident and important in devices with scaled channel length. Furthermore, the mechanical instability of flexible substrates limits the feature size of flexible TFTs. Contact resistance and overlapping capacitance are two parasitic effects which limit the transit frequency of transistors. They are often considered independent, while a deeper analysis of TFTs geometry imposes to handle them together; in fact, they both depend on the overlapping length (LOV) between source/drain and the gate contacts. Here, we conduct a quantitative analysis based on a large number of flexible ultra-scaled IGZO TFTs. Devices with three different values of overlap length and channel length down to 0. 5 [*]μm are fabricated to experimentally investigate the scaling behavior of the transit frequency. Contact resistance and overlapping capacitance depend in opposite ways on LOV. These findings establish routes for the optimization of the dimension of source/drain contact pads and suggest design guidelines to achieve megahertz operation in flexible IGZO TFTs and circuits...|$|R
