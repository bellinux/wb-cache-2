500|$|Between October 1772 and June 1775, Jervis {{travelled}} extensively. He {{began in}} France {{where he studied}} the language and made observations about French life. He accompanied Captain Samuel Barrington to Russia where they spent time in Saint Petersburg and inspected the arsenal and dockyards at Kronstadt and took {{a tour of the}} yacht designed by Sir Charles Knowles for Catherine of Russia. The pair continued on to Sweden, Denmark and northern Germany. All the while Jervis made notes on defences, <b>harbour</b> <b>charts</b> and safe anchorages. They came home via the Netherlands, Jervis once again making extensive studies of the area and taking copious notes describing any useful information. He and Barrington then took a private cruise along the Channel coast calling at various harbours including Brest, making and improving their charts as they went. When Jervis later became the Commander-in-Chief of the Channel Fleet he was aided significantly in his blockade of Brest by these charts. In later years, he commented: [...] "Had the young Captain Jervis not performed such a complete survey of this port then the Earl St Vincent {{would not have been able}} to effect such a thorough blockade of it." ...|$|R
