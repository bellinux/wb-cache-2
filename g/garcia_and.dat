5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on January16 to {{the west}} of Diego <b>Garcia,</b> <b>and</b> that day Météo-France (MF) classified the system as Tropical Disturbance 08. The system maintained thunderstorms over a developing circulation, located in an area of weak to moderate wind shear. It developed outflow and gradually organized, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert on January17. That day, the MF discontinued advisories after the system briefly halted its development trend. The disturbance continued its movement {{to the west}}-southwest, and on January19 began intensifying. That day, the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 12S {{to the north of the}} northern coast of Madagascar. After continued development, MF upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Ernest on January20.|$|E
5|$|Another elite unit {{would be}} the Black Guard, a 25-man guerrilla unit under a certain Lieutenant García. García, one of Luna's favorites, was a modest but brave soldier. His unit was tasked to {{approach}} the enemy by surprise and quickly return to camp. Luna had admired García's unit very much {{that he wanted to}} increase their size. However, García declined the offer. He believed that a larger force might undermine the efficiency of their work. Jose Alejandrino, the chief army engineer and one of Luna's aides, stated that he never heard of <b>García</b> <b>and</b> his unit again after Luna's resignation on February 28.|$|E
5|$|Bane lures Gotham's police {{underground}} and uses explosives to trap them {{and destroy the}} bridges surrounding the city. He kills Mayor Anthony <b>Garcia</b> <b>and</b> forces Dr. Leonid Pavel, a Russian nuclear physicist he kidnapped from Uzbekistan, to convert the reactor core into an atomic bomb before killing him as well. Bane then uses the bomb to hold the city hostage and isolate Gotham from the world. Using Gordon's stolen speech, Bane reveals the cover-up of Dent's crimes to the public, and releases the prisoners of Blackgate Penitentiary, initiating anarchy. The wealthy and powerful are then taken captive and given show trials presided over by Jonathan Crane, where all are sentenced to death.|$|E

5|$|Coming {{into the}} match, the Kerala Blasters {{made a couple}} {{necessary}} defensive changes from the squad that faced Chennaiyin in the semi-finals. David James replaced the injured Sandip Nandy in goal, while Saumik Dey and Nirmal Chettri replaced the suspended pair of Jamie McAllister and Gurwinder Singh {{in the middle of}} defense. Atlético de Kolkata head coach, Antonio Lopez Habas, meanwhile decided to bench the team's marquee player, Luis <b>García,</b> <b>and</b> instead started Arnal in central midfield. Habas also decided to switch to playing four defenders instead of three, which meant that Kingshuk Debnath started the match while Lester Fernandez moved to the bench.|$|E

The band released an extended play (EP), Sons of Kyuss (1990), when Homme was 16, before going on to record four critically acclaimed studio albums and a greatest hits release, without breaking through to mainstream success. After the break-up of the band in 1995, Homme considered abandoning his music career, but was persuaded by vocalist Mark Lanegan to join the Screaming Trees on tour as second guitarist.|$|E
5|$|On March8, a {{circulation}} was observed southeast of Diego <b>Garcia</b> <b>and</b> was undergoing tropical cyclogenesis. By the next day, satellite imagery {{indicated that a}} tropical storm had formed about 635km (395mi) south of the island, given the name Honorinina. On March9, the Météo France office in Réunion (MFR) began tracking the storm in its database, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 25S. The nascent tropical storm moved generally to the west-southwest, gradually intensifying. On March11, the JTWC upgraded Honorinina to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane with 1minute maximum sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph). On the next day, the MFR followed suit by upgrading the storm to tropical cyclone status while it was passing 175km (110mi) north of St. Brandon island.|$|E

5|$|The Indians {{played in}} the 1948 World Series and were helped by Lemon's two {{pitching}} wins as they won the club's first championship since 1920. In the early 1950s, Cleveland had a starting pitching rotation which included Lemon, Bob Feller, Mike <b>Garcia</b> <b>and</b> Early Wynn. During the 1954 season, Lemon had a career-best 23–7 win–loss record and the Indians set a 154-game season AL-record win mark when they won 111 games before they won the American League (AL) pennant. He was an All-Star for seven consecutive seasons and recorded seven seasons of 20 or more pitching wins in a nine-year period from 1948–1956.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} Liverpool 13th {{appearance}} in the final. They had won on six occasions (1965, 1974, 1986, 1989, 1992, 2001) and lost six times (1914, 1950, 1971, 1977, 1988, 1996). West Ham were appearing in their fifth final, they had previously won three (1964, 1975, 1980) and lost once in the 1923 FA Cup Final. Liverpool had won both the meetings between the teams in the Premier League during the season. A 2–0 home victory {{at the end of}} October, was followed by a 2–1 win at the end of April. The latter match saw Liverpool midfielder Luis <b>García</b> <b>and</b> West Ham defender Hayden Mullins sent off, which meant they would both be suspended for the final.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} persisted {{toward the end}} of April between Diego <b>Garcia</b> <b>and</b> the equator. It developed a spiral area of convection on April24, which preceded the development of a tropical disturbance the next day. By that time, the system was already at tropical storm status and was given the name Karla. Moving southwest, the storm strengthened and organized. A ridge to the south steered Karla to the east on April27, although an approaching trough turned it to the southeast on the following day. Enhanced atmospheric instability helped the storm strengthen to tropical cyclone status on April29. On the next day, Karla attained peak winds of 170km/h (105mph) after developing a well-defined eye. Increased wind shear and progressively cooler waters weakened the cyclone as it turned more to the south. By May3, the storm weakened to tropical depression status and dissipated the next day within the westerlies.|$|E

5|$|After an {{extended}} period of inactivity lasting nearly a month, the ITCZ produced an area of convection on March1 between Diego <b>Garcia</b> <b>and</b> the Seychelles. There were initially two weak circulations, although the one south-southwest of Diego Garcia ultimately became Cyclone Dera. It moved southwestward without much development at first due to hostile wind shear, with the circulation often exposed from the thunderstorms. On March4, the system developed into a tropical disturbance off the northeast coast of Madagascar. Two days later, the storm moved ashore Madagascar about 50km (30mi) southeast of Antsiranana. It weakened and became indistinct over land, emerging into the Mozambique Channel near Nosy Be as a weak low. Convection gradually increased across the region as the track shifted westward. After moving toward Mozambique, the system rounded the ridge and turned to the south just off the coast, passing only 10km (6mi) east of Angoche. Around that time, the thunderstorms began organizing more, allowing the disturbance to intensify into a tropical depression on March8. With warm waters and an anticyclone providing outflow, the depression quickly intensified, becoming Tropical Storm Dera on March9 and soon after developing an eye feature. Also on that day, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 15S.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, Miller {{died and}} was succeeded by Steve Rickard {{who ran the}} Dominion Wrestling Union for two years until {{starting}} All Star Pro-Wrestling in 1962. Fellow wrestler John da Silva also began a rival promotion, Central Wrestling Association, around this time but it eventually closed in the early 1970s. After Miller's death, regular appearances by American wrestlers declined considerably, though a few still managed to arrive each year. In that time, a number of local stars were developed in New Zealand including Tony Garea, Peter Maivia, Al Hobman, and The Sheepherders. From {{other parts of the}} world came Australian wrestlers Ron Miller and Larry O'Day of World Championship Wrestling, Robert Bruce from Scotland, Canadians Gordon Nelson and George Gordienko, and André the Giant. South Pacific Wrestling, another small promotion started by referee Ernie Pinches, produced Johnny <b>Garcia</b> <b>and</b> Onno Boelee during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Clorinde {{had been}} almost {{undamaged}} in the battle and comfortably outran all British pursuit. Without a safe harbour in the entire Indian Ocean, Saint-Criq initially sailed for the Seychelles, hiding among the islands until 7 June. On 26 June, Clorinde landed at Diego <b>Garcia</b> <b>and</b> collected fresh water and coconuts before beginning the return journey to France {{in defiance of the}} orders to continue on to Batavia issued before the convoy left Brest. On 1 August, Clorinde passed the Cape of Good Hope, Saint-Criq supplementing his provisions by raiding British and American merchant ships in the Atlantic. On 24 September, Clorinde encountered the British blockade squadron off Brest and was chased by the 80-gun ship of the line HMS Tonnant under Captain Sir John Gore. Although Tonnant came close enough to Clorinde to discharge her broadside at the frigate, Gore was unable to catch the elusive French ship and was eventually forced to retire to open waters after coming under fire from batteries at Pointe Trépassée. By 17:00, Clorinde was anchored in Brest harbour. Saint-Criq was heavily criticised for his failure to support Roquebert and for ignoring his orders to sail to Batavia if Mauritius had been captured. In March 1812, he was brought to a court martial to examine his behaviour and found to have been negligent in his duty, for which he was dismissed from the service, expelled from the legion of Honour and sentenced to three years' imprisonment. Napoleon is reported to have suggested that Saint-Criq be shot for deserting his commanding officer.|$|E
