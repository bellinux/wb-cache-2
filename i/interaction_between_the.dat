5|$|At higher {{temperatures}} tellurium {{is sufficiently}} plastic to extrude. It melts at 449.51°C. Crystalline tellurium has a structure consisting of parallel infinite spiral chains.

Tellurium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 1.0S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.32 to 0.38eV. Liquid tellurium is a semiconductor, with an electrical conductivity, on melting, of around 1.9 × 103S•cm−1. Superheated liquid tellurium is a metallic conductor.|$|E

In 1803, the Louisiana Purchase by Thomas Jefferson brought the area under United States control. In 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which removed American Indian tribes from the Southeast and {{relocated}} them to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. The southern part of this territory was originally assigned to the Choctaw and Chickasaw. In 1867, the United States used the Medicine Lodge Treaty to allot the southwest portion of the Choctaw and Chickasaw’s lands to the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache tribes.|$|E

5|$|Researchers {{speculate}} that acoustical mimicry {{is related to}} the level of <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> host and parasite. In the Phengaris genus, there are two different strategies: the cuckoo strategy used by P. rebeli and the predatory strategy used by Phengaris arion. In P. rebeli, the Phengaris larvae become integrated into the colony and are attended by worker ants. However, larvae in predatory species prey on the ants’ brood and consequently spend much of their life hiding in pockets of the brood nest.|$|E
5|$|The Andes prevent rain-bearing clouds {{from the}} Pacific Ocean from moving in, while its {{latitude}} {{puts it in}} a band of the sub-tropical high pressure belt keeping the region dry. Droughts are often frequent and prolonged. The Cuyo region {{is influenced by the}} subtropical, semi–permanent South Atlantic High to the east in the Atlantic, the semi-permanent South Pacific High {{to the west of the}} Andes, and the development of the Chaco Low and westerlies in the southern parts of the region.

5|$|The <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Ganymedian {{magnetosphere}} and Jovian plasma is in {{many respects}} {{similar to that of}} the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere. The plasma co-rotating with Jupiter impinges on the trailing side of the Ganymedian magnetosphere much like the solar wind impinges on the Earth's magnetosphere. The main difference is the speed of plasma flow—supersonic in the case of Earth and subsonic in the case of Ganymede. Because of the subsonic flow, there is no bow shock off the trailing hemisphere of Ganymede.|$|E

5|$|The {{noble gases}} are nearly ideal gases under {{standard}} conditions, but their {{deviations from the}} ideal gas law provided important clues {{for the study of}} intermolecular interactions. The Lennard-Jones potential, often used to model intermolecular interactions, was deduced in 1924 by John Lennard-Jones from experimental data on argon before the development of quantum mechanics provided the tools for understanding intermolecular forces from first principles. The theoretical analysis of these interactions became tractable because the noble gases are monatomic and the atoms spherical, which means that the <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> atoms is independent of direction, or isotropic.|$|E
5|$|Various {{inflammatory}} {{processes and}} cytokines {{may also have}} a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease.

Obesity and systemic inflammation may interfere with immunological processes which promote disease progression.|$|E
5|$|As a {{tropical}} cyclone, Cristobal had minimal effect to any land masses. Its remnants brought unsettled conditions to Bermuda, including a 45mph (72km/h) wind gust at the Bermuda International Airport.

The <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> remnants of Cristobal and a high pressure system over the Mid-Atlantic States produced rip currents and 4foot (1.2m) waves along the south shore of Long Island, New York; three people drowned from the rip currents.

5|$|Besides {{the galactic}} tide, the main trigger for sending comets {{into the inner}} Solar System {{is thought to be}} <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Sun's Oort cloud and the {{gravitational}} fields of nearby stars or giant molecular clouds. The orbit of the Sun through the plane of the Milky Way sometimes brings it in relatively close proximity to other stellar systems. For example, it is hypothesized that 70thousand years ago, perhaps Scholz's star passed through the outer Oort cloud (although its low mass and high relative velocity limited its effect). During the next 10million years the known star with the greatest possibility of perturbing the Oort cloud is Gliese 710. This process could also scatter Oort cloud objects out of the ecliptic plane, potentially also explaining its spherical distribution.|$|E
5|$|In late July, a monsoon {{depression}} moved {{across much of}} India, and another monsoon disturbance persisted {{off the coast of}} Pakistan. The <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two systems resulted in heavy rainfall across the region, flooding dozens of villages. Monsoonal rainfall killed 285people between Pakistan and India in the summer of 2003. In late August, another {{monsoon depression}} moved across northeastern India. A depression that struck Andhra Pradesh in India killed 21people in early October. Later that month, a tropical depression crossed Thailand from the western Pacific Ocean, contributing to ongoing flooding that killed 19. Once in the Indian Ocean, this system struck southeastern India without causing much damage. The last system of the year was a cyclonic storm that struck southeastern India in December, killing 81people and causing $28million in damage (2003USD).|$|E
5|$|In the camp, {{the detainees}} {{suffered}} from tropical diseases and inadequate food and clothing. Jewish {{organizations such as}} the South African Jewish Board of Deputies, the Jewish Agency, and the Zionist Federation, sent food, clothing, medicine, and religious items to the detainees. Initially, a ban on <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> sexes was enforced; the men were held in a former jailhouse and the women in adjacent iron huts. After the ban was lifted, 60 children were born in the camp. In total, 128 prisoners died in the camp, and were buried in the Jewish section of St. Martin Cemetery. At the end of World War II, the detainees were given the choice of returning to their former homes in Europe or immigrating to Palestine. Most chose Palestine, and on August 6, 1945, 1,320 landed in Haifa.|$|E
