50|$|Previously {{travellers}} to Mäkkylä from Espoo {{could use}} an Espoo <b>internal</b> <b>ticket,</b> and travellers from Helsinki {{could use a}} Helsinki <b>internal</b> <b>ticket.</b> However YTV changed this, and after 28 August 2005 Mäkkylä is considered within Espoo. As a result, travellers from Helsinki require a regional ticket (seutulippu, regionbiljett).|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} {{extensively}} renovated {{in the winter}} of 1993/1994. A new peaked roof was constructed over the gentlemen's toilets, and the old wooden canopy removed and window apertures converted into archways. At this time the station master's office was halved in size to create a booking hall and a new <b>internal</b> <b>ticket</b> hatch installed, the original being blocked off the waiting room was also reopened, having been closed for over 30 years. The overhauled station was reopened with suitable ceremony later that year by local politician Phil Kermode who at the time was the minister with responsibility for the railway. During the winter of 2012 the partition in the booking hall was removed, recreating the full sized office, and the fireplace reinstated; the original ticket hatch was also brought back into use. In the summer months the station building is adorned with flower baskets and period features such as milk churns (a nod to the station's former importance for handling goods and freight traffic), reproduction notice boards and enamelled signage reinstated on the exterior walls based upon period photographs. This work was carried out by the Friends Of... group.|$|E
5000|$|Integrate - Integrations {{are a key}} {{requirement}} of a TIP. Data from the platform needs {{to find a way}} back into the security tools and products used by an organization. Full-featured TIPs enable the flow of information collected and analyzed from feeds, etc. and disseminate and integrate the cleaned data to other network tools including SIEMs, <b>internal</b> <b>ticketing</b> systems, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and more. Furthermore, APIs allow for the automation of actions without direct user involvement.|$|R

25|$|<b>Internal</b> single trip <b>tickets</b> {{are valid}} {{for one hour}} (for the eastern and north eastern feeder lines 80 minutes). For {{regional}} tickets the transfer time is 80 minutes or 100 minutes for the ticket covering the whole region.|$|R
50|$|The Security Plant Complex, or SPC, was {{formally}} established on September 7, 1978 {{to safeguard the}} printing, minting, refining, issuance, distribution and durability of coins, banknotes, gold bars, government official receipts, lottery <b>tickets,</b> <b>internal</b> revenue stamps, passports, seaman identification record books, strip stamps, official documents, registration certificates, Torrens titles, treasury warrants, stocks and bonds, government contracts, ration coupons, official ballots, election return forms, checks and other security printing or minting jobs of the Philippine government.|$|R
50|$|The system, known officially as PERTIS (Permit to Travel Issuing System), {{was first}} {{introduced}} by Network SouthEast in November 1988 on the LTS route between London Fenchurch Street and Shoeburyness. The machines, which closely resemble those found in pay and display car parks, were manufactured by Almex Control Systems. Machines were given the designation AS-9 (wall-mounted) or AS-88 (mounted on a metal base), but <b>internal</b> workings and <b>tickets</b> were identical in each case.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{grant was}} to take the {{technological}} innovations for deploying survey instruments to mobile phones, developed under a previous OTREC grant, and publish them as globally accessible mobile applications (apps) for use in a variety of transportation planning settings. Under this grant, three applications have been developed for three distinctly different user groups. The first, JLA Involve, was developed and deployed for JLA, a Portland, OR. -based public involvement firm, to support their work with the City of Tualatin, OR., in updating their Transportation System Plan (TSP). The second was developed and deployed for the City of Eugene, OR., and allows citizens to submit bike-lane service requests directly to the City’s <b>internal</b> Work <b>Ticket</b> (MMS) system for quickly responding to and resolving requests. The third application, Make It So, was developed and deployed by University of Oregon (UO) transportation researcher Marc Schlossberg, and makes generalized mobile survey instruments available to other transportation researchers around the world through Apple’s App Store. All are utilizing Esri’s API for iOS or Android to maximize the potential for recipients of mobilegenerated data to incorporate it directly into their existing spatial data management/GIS systems and workflows...|$|R

40|$|The cost {{of resolving}} user {{requests}} for IT assistance rises annually. Researchers {{have demonstrated that}} data warehouse analytic techniques can improve service, {{but they have not}} established the benefit of using global organizational data to reduce reported IT incidents. The purpose of this quantitative, quasi-experimental {{study was to examine the}} extent to which IT staff use of organizational knowledge generated from data warehouse analytical measures reduces the number of IT incidents over a 30 -day period, as reported by global users of IT within an international pharmaceutical company headquartered in Germany. Organizational learning theory was used to approach the theorized relationship between organizational knowledge and user calls received. Archival data from an <b>internal</b> help desk <b>ticketing</b> system was the source of data, with access provided by the organization under study. The population for this study was all calls logged and linked to application systems registered in a configuration database, and the sample was the top 14 application systems with the highest call volume that were under the control of infrastructure management. Based on an analysis of the data using a split-plot ANOVA (SPANOVA) of Time 1, Time 2, treatment, and nontreatment data, there was a small reduction in calls in the number of reported IT incidents in the treatment group, though the reduction was not statistically significant. Implications for positive social change include reassigning employees to other tasks, rather than continuing efforts in this area, enabling employees to support alternative initiatives to drive the development of innovative therapies benefiting patients and improving employee satisfaction...|$|R
