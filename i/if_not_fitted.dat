Instead of conventional shoulder restraints, the ride uses special hip restraints. This does allow freedom of upper body movement, however it can cause discomfort <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>fitted</b> properly to the lower body.|$|E

Vehicles with the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers and Royal Signals were originally fitted with the L4A4 variant of the Bren light machine gun, but they now use the GPMG. When equipped with the GPMG, the vehicle carries 1,600 rounds of belted 7.62mm ammunition; when carrying the Bren LMG, the vehicle carried 1,400 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition (50 magazines, each holding 28 rounds). There are two three-barrel smoke dischargers at the front.|$|E
50|$|In {{the same}} way it is common for people to {{customize}} their Jazzmasters, it is popular for the SJM owner to replace the bridge on models fitted with a tremolo, with a Fender Mustang bridge and change out the tuners and possibly the volume and tone knobs because of their low quality plastic. A buzzstop can be installed to stop unwanted buzz and keep some tension on the strings, though some users find this dramatically alters the tonal properties of the guitar and interferes with tremolo use. <b>If</b> <b>not</b> <b>fitted</b> with a buzzstop, third bridge techniques are possible. It is also possible to insert a thin cardboard or wooden shim into the base of the neck pocket to increase the neck angle, resulting in a lower action.|$|E
40|$|Ankle {{injuries}} {{are the most}} common injuries across a wide variety of sports. 6, 12, 14, 16, 22 Athletes who suffer from ankle sprains are more likely to reinjure the same ankle, 2, 5, 10, 17 which can result in disability and can lead to chronic pain or instability in 20 % to 50 % of these cases. 13 Of all sports, volleyball has a relatively high incidence of sprains con-sidering the noncontact nature of this game. 2 This high incidence of ankle sprains in volleyball and their negative consequences for future sports participation call for pre-ventive measures. Braces and tape are widely used measures to prevent ankle sprains. It is known from previous research that use of braces reduces incidence of ankle sprain, 1, 6, 12, 14, 16 and it is argued that tape also has a preventive effect because the working mechanism is thought to be similar to braces. However, both measures have negative side effects 19; for example, whereas braces can be irritating <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>fitted</b> properly and are argued to negatively affect performance, tape loosens during play, needs to be applied by qualified personnel, and can cause skin irritation. Proprioceptive balance board training is another meas-ure, presumably as effective as braces and tape but with-out the above-mentioned negative side effects. 3, 17, 20 This measure is already used in the rehabilitation following ankle sprain to restrengthen muscles and ligaments and to restore proprioception of the damaged structures around the ankle. 7 - 9 Proprioceptive balance board training has also been suggested as an alternative to taping or bracing in the prevention of ankle sprains.

50|$|A major, if subtle, {{difference}} between C and Pascal {{is how they}} promote integer operations.

Necrosectomy is indicated for infected necrosis or sterile necro-sis if there are persisting clinically significant symptoms. There is increasing evidence for the use of minimally invasive pancreatic necrosectomy. Enteral nutrition should be instituted whenever possible but antibiotics should be reserved for patients with proven sepsis. The presence of fungal infection requires active anti-fungal therapy. Patients with severe disease should undergo cholecystectomy at a later stage. Patients who have undergone necrosectomy require long-term follow-up because of delayed complications.
