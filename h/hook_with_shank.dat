40|$|Three {{species of}} Volsellituba n. g. and {{two species of}} Pennulituba n. g. are {{described}} from the gills of the yellowfin goatfish Mulloidichthys vanicolensis (Valenciennes) off New Caledonia (South Pacific). Volsellituba and Pennulituba resemble dactylogyrid genera whose species lack eye-spots and possess tandem or slightly overlapping gonads, a single prostatic reservoir, a male copulatory organ without an accessory piece, a dextroventral non-sclerotised vagina, ventral and dorsal anchor/bar complexes, and <b>hooks</b> <b>with</b> <b>shanks</b> comprising a single slender unit. Volsellituba n. g. is characterised by its species having ventral tegumental folds {{at the level of}} the vaginal duct, a male copulatory organ with a subterminal basal opening and a two-piece dorsal bar. The following new species of Volsellituba are described: V. orchidea n. sp. (type-species), V. nabla n. sp. and V. elephantina n. sp. Pennulituba n. g. is distinguished by its species possessing a male copulatory organ with a wing-shaped membrane and a dorsal bar with a poorly to non-sclerotised medial part. This genus includes P. piratifalx n. sp. (type-species) and P. cymansis n. sp. A tabular summary of the species of Haliotrema Johnston & Tiegs, 1922 reported from mullids is provided...|$|R

50|$|Old USS and SAE {{standards}} defined {{cap screws}} as fasteners <b>with</b> <b>shanks</b> that were threaded {{to the head}} and bolts as fasteners <b>with</b> <b>shanks</b> that were partially unthreaded. The relationship of this rule {{to the idea that}} a bolt by definition takes a nut is clear (because the unthreaded section of the shank, which is called the grip, was expected to pass through the substrate without threading into it). This is now an obsolete distinction, although large bolts still often have unthreaded sections of shank.|$|R

50|$|Shank boutons have {{a hollow}} {{protrusion}} {{on the back}} through which thread is sewn to attach the button. Button shanks may be a separate piece added {{to the back of}} a button, or be carved or moulded directly onto the back of the button, in which case the button is referred to by collectors as having a 'self-shank'. This is a common construction for older shell and glass buttons, for example. Buttons <b>with</b> <b>shanks</b> have no holes in the button blank (the main part of the button) itself because they are not needed for sewing. Buttons <b>with</b> <b>shanks</b> are more expensive to produce than shankless buttons.|$|R

40|$|International audiencePhelan McDermid Syndrome (PMDS) is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} characterized by features of Autism spectrum disorders. Similar to reports of Zn deficiency in autistic children, we have previously reported {{high incidence of}} Zn deficiency in PMDS. However, the underlying mechanisms are currently not well understood. Here, using inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry to measure the concentration of Zinc (Zn) and Copper (Cu) in hair samples from individuals with PMDS with 22 q 13. 3 deletion including SHANK 3 (SH 3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3), we report {{a high rate of}} abnormally low Zn/Cu ratios. To investigate possible underlying mechanisms, we generated enterocytes from PMDS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and used Caco- 2 cells <b>with</b> knockdown of <b>SHANK</b> 3. We detected decreased expression of Zn uptake transporters ZIP 2 and ZIP 4 on mRNA and protein level correlating <b>with</b> <b>SHANK</b> 3 expression levels, and found reduced levels of ZIP 4 protein co-localizing <b>with</b> <b>SHANK</b> 3 at the plasma membrane. We demonstrated that especially ZIP 4 exists in a complex <b>with</b> <b>SHANK</b> 3. Furthermore, we performed immunohistochemistry on gut sections from Shank 3 αβ knockout mice and confirmed a link between enterocytic SHANK 3, ZIP 2 and ZIP 4. We conclude that apart from its well-known role in the CNS, SHANK 3 might play a specific role in the GI tract...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Intensification of soil {{compaction}} process under no-tillage (NT) is motivating {{the search for}} alternatives to mitigate {{soil compaction}} state. This study evaluated changes in soil physical and hydraulic properties caused by seeder <b>with</b> fertilizer <b>shanks</b> at different depths compared with the double discs lagged seeder, to investigate the possibility of soil decompaction by sowing under NT in southern Brazil. The {{study was conducted in}} a clayed Oxisol, for 27 years under NT. Treatments were three planting mechanisms: S 0. 10 m: cutting disc combined <b>with</b> <b>shank</b> acting to 0. 10 m depth; S 0. 15 m: cutting disc combined <b>with</b> <b>shank</b> acting to 0. 15 m depth and, D 0. 07 m: double discs lagged acting to 0. 07 m depth in an experimental randomized block design with four replications. We evaluated the soil mechanical resistance, water infiltration rate, soil bulk density, pore size distribution and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Results indicated that the use of seeder <b>with</b> fertilizer <b>shanks</b> acting at 0. 15 m deep promoted the soil decompaction by the reduction of penetration resistance and increase of porosity and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. To have significant increase in water infiltration rate the fertilizer shanks of the seeder must be deepened to the lower limit of the compacted surface layer...|$|R
