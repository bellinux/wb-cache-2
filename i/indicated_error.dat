The present study conducts an investigation into the existence of scoring errors by 27 professional occupational psychologists using the Rothwell-Miller Interest Blank (RMIB; Miller, Tyler & Rothwell, 1994).

Data from 1175 completed RMIB survey forms <b>indicated</b> <b>error</b> rates for the three systems ranged from five to 16. 3 percent, with the self-managed work allocation system resulting in the lowest error rate.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{troublesome}} contributions to the NNLO QCD corrections to ¯ B → Xsγ originates from three-loop matrix elements of four-quark operators. A part of this contribution that {{is proportional to the}} QCD beta-function coefficient β 0 was found in 2003 as an expansion in mc/mb. In the present paper, we evaluate the asymptotic behaviour of the complete contribution for mc ≫ mb/ 2. The asymptotic form of the β 0 -part matches the small-mc expansion very well at the threshold mc = mb/ 2. For the remaining part, we perform an interpolation down to the measured value of mc, assuming that the β 0 -part is a good approximation at mc = 0. Combining our results with other contributions to the NNLO QCD corrections, we find B (¯ B → Xsγ) = (3. 15 ± 0. 23) × 10 − 4 for Eγ> 1. 6 GeV in the ¯ B-meson rest frame.

Measurements of fieldlevel LAI, aerosol optical thickness and water vapor were carried out {{on the day of}} LISS-III overpass. Empirical models based on site-specific LAI-vegetation index relation were developed and used to generate 23 -meter resolution LAI maps for two sites (Indore and Bhopal) covering 30 km X 30 km. These LAI images were aggregated to 1 km spatial resolution and used for validation of MODIS LAI product (MOD 15 A 1). The results indicated significant positive correlation between LAI derived from LISS-III data and MODIS data, with an overestimation in the MODIS product, with RMSE of 0. 92 to 1. 26 for Bhopal site and 0. 20 to 0. 33 for Indore site.

40|$|L-edge {{extended}} x-ray-absorption {{fine structure}} (EXAFS) spectra of {{solid and liquid}} tin have been collected by using synchrotron radiation. Information on local structure has been obtained by simultaneous analysis of Sn L(3) -, L(2) -, and L(1) -edge EXAFS spectra by using an original data-analysis scheme based on the nb initio multiple-scattering GNXAS method. The use of the three edges allowed {{the extension of the}} energy range of the useful data increasing the accuracy of the derived structural parameters. Details of the multiple-edge data-analysis methodology are provided. The general interest of the method for multiple-edge structural studies of monatomic and multiatomic systems is discussed. A very good agreement with diffraction data is found for crystalline Sn. The first-neighbor distribution is studied as a function of temperature. Statistical errors on the structural parameters are provided. The model pair distribution function g(r) obtained by x-ray-diffraction data is refined in liquid Sn at T= 245 degrees C. The EXAFS structural signal is shown to be very sensitive to the short-range correlations. The foot of the first peak of the g(r) is found to be steeper and the mean distance is found slightly shorter than previously <b>indicated.</b> <b>Error</b> bars on the g(r), due to random errors in the EXAFS data, are also shown.

40|$|In {{carrying}} out eddy current thickness measurement of two-layer conductive objects {{one from the}} interfering factors {{is the presence of}} variations {{in the value of the}} electrical conductivity of the material of the upper layer (coating) when moving from point to point on the surface of object of control or when passing from one object of control to another. The aim of this work is to evaluate the accuracy of determining the thickness of the conductive coating disposed on a conducting ferromagnetic basis, using the phase method of eddy current testing. The reason of the error is variation of the electrical conductivity of the material of coating. Determination of the error is based on calculations using known analytical expressions for the loop with current of sinusoidal form arranged over the infinite half space with a covering as a thin layer. Selected in calculating electromagnetic parameters of coating and substrate approximately correspond to the case -chromium layer on a nickel base. Calculations are performed for different frequencies of current passed through coil. It is shown that at reduction of frequency of the current passes through the coil the error is reduced. The value of the lowest possible operating frequency of the excitation current is determined by the condition of absence influence on the phase introduced into the superimposed transducer emf variations in the thickness of the basis. To reduce the <b>indicated</b> <b>error</b> it is proposed to determine, on the basis of phase method at a relatively high frequency transducer current excitation, conductivity of the material of coating. After this, at a low frequency excitation current and using phase method, the coating thickness is determined, taking into consideration the previously determined value of the conductivity of coating. Also discussed ways to improve the accuracy of phase measurements in the MHz region of the excitation current frequency.  </p...|$|E

40|$|Life cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) is {{a quantitative}} tool {{used to evaluate}} the environmental impacts of products or processes. With respect to buildings, LCA can be {{used to evaluate the}} environmental impacts of an entire building life cycle. Currently, LCA in the building area is used in a limited capacity, and primarily for selecting building products. In order to determine the causality for the lack of whole building LCAs, focus groups with members of the architecture, engineering, construction (AEC) communities were held. This research ascertains first the current level of knowledge of LCA in the AEC community and then discusses the benefits and barriers to the practice of LCA. From the focus group results, the most important benefit to LCA was: Provides information about environmental impacts. The results did not identify a prominent barrier; however, building-related metrics were ascertained {{to be one of the}} more crucial barriers. One limitation of LCA is the uncertainty associated with its results, which in this research is exemplified in the correlation between LCA and building energy models. In past research, results from energy models have been utilized to calculate life cycle operating energy of buildings in order to predict environmental impacts through LCA. Due to assumptions and variations between input data, past research has indicated substantial error rates in energy model results. In order to employ a life cycle perspective, the relationship between total life cycle energy use and energy modeling results has been studied. The main question guiding this research was: what is the acceptable error rate between predicted and actual life cycle energy use? Three different energy modeling programs with varying levels of detail were utilized to generate energy data for a case study, low energy home.
