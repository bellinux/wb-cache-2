500|$|Bax {{was born}} in the London suburb of Streatham, Surrey, to a prosperous Victorian family. He was the eldest son of Alfred Ridley Bax (1844–1918) and his wife, Charlotte Ellen, née Lea (1860–1940). The couple's {{youngest}} son, Clifford Lea Bax, became a playwright and essayist. Alfred Bax was a barrister of the Middle Temple, but having a private income he did not practise. In 1896 the family moved to a mansion in Hampstead. Bax later wrote that although it would have been good to be raised in the country, the large gardens of the family house were the next best thing. He was a musical child: [...] "I cannot remember the long-lost <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was unable to play the piano – inaccurately".|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Deuces" [...] is a slow, down-tempo R ballad that {{displays}} {{elements of}} house and pop music. The song has {{a length of}} four minutes and thirty-six seconds. It is backed by synth chords and [...] "eerie harmonies", with Brown's [...] "smooth vocals" [...] making use of auto-tune effects. According to Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio, the song contains lyrical content about [...] "breaking {{it off with a}} girl after failed attempts to make the relationship work". In the first verse, Brown sings: [...] "All that bullshit is for the birds, you ain't nothing but a vulture / Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up / You'll regret the <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> find another girl, that knows just what I need / She knows just what I mean." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title track}} of the album, [...] "International Velvet", {{featuring}} the line [...] "Every <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wake up I thank the Lord I'm Welsh" [...] and Welsh language verses, received additional attention from the media.

Our football team is shit. The song is saying, despite all these things, I still {{wake up in the morning}} and thank the Lord that I'm Welsh.

[...] In front of 70,000 spectators, Catatonia performed [...] "International Velvet" [...] at the opening ceremony of the 1999 Rugby World Cup in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

500|$|Lawrence Morton, in a {{study of}} the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's {{collection}} Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is [...] "Yarila" [...] which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: [...] "The likeness is too close to be coincidental". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music {{rather than the other way}} round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: [...] "One <b>day</b> , <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps".|$|E

500|$|Norman Schwarzkopf was {{described}} by childhood friends as active and assertive, protective of his sisters and a skilled athlete. He spent his childhood attached to his father, who subsequently became the narrator for the Gang Busters radio program. When Norman Schwarzkopf was eight years old, his father returned to the military amid World War II. His continuous absence made home life difficult, particularly for his wife. As a 10-year-old cadet at Bordentown Military Institute, near Trenton, he posed for his official photograph wearing a stern expression because – as he said afterwards – [...] "Some <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> become a general, I {{want people to know}} that I’m serious." [...] In 1946, when Norman Schwarzkopf was 12, he moved with his father to Tehran, Iran. In Iran, Norman learned shooting, horseback riding, and hunting. Schwarzkopf developed a lifelong interest in Middle Eastern culture. The family moved to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1947, following a new military assignment for Herbert Schwarzkopf. The senior Schwarzkopf visited Italy, Heidelberg, Frankfurt, and Berlin, Germany during his military duties, and the younger Schwarzkopf accompanied him. By 1951 he had returned to Iran briefly before returning to the United States. Herbert Schwarzkopf died in 1958. From a young age, Norman wanted to be a military officer, following his father's example.|$|E
