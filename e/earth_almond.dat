50|$|Cyperus esculentus (also called chufa sedge, nut grass, yellow nutsedge, tiger nut sedge, or <b>earth</b> <b>almond)</b> is {{a crop of}} the sedge family {{widespread}} {{across much}} of the world. It is found in most of the Western Hemisphere, as well as Southern Europe, Africa, Madagascar, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. Historically it has become naturalized in many other regions, including Ukraine, China, Hawaii, Indochina, New Guinea, Java, New South Wales, and various oceanic islands.|$|E
40|$|The insecticidal {{effect of}} six commercially {{available}} plant oils was tested against 4 th larval instars of Culex pipiens. Larvae were originally collected from Meit El-Attar, Qalyubia Governorate, Egypt, and then reared {{in the laboratory}} until F 1 generation. The LC 50 values were 32. 42, 47. 17, 71. 37, 83. 36, 86. 06, and 152. 94 ppm for fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-grecum), <b>earth</b> <b>almond</b> (Cyperus esculentus), mustard (Brassica compestris), olibanum (Boswellia serrata), rocket (Eruca sativa), and parsley (Carum ptroselinum), respectively. The tested oils altered some biological aspects of C. pipiens, for instance, developmental periods, pupation rates, and adult emergences. The lowest concentrations of olibanum and fenugreek oils caused remarkable prolongation of larval and pupal durations. Data also showed that the increase of concentrations was directly proportional to reduction in pupation rates and adult emergences. Remarkable decrease in pupation rate was achieved by mustard oil at 1000 ppm. Adult emergence was suppressed by <b>earth</b> <b>almond</b> and fenugreek oils at 25 ppm. In addition, the tested plant oils exhibited various morphological abnormalities on larvae, pupae, and adult stages. Consequently, fenugreek was the most potent oil and the major cause of malformation of both larval and pupal stages. Potency of the applied plant oils provided an excellent potential for controlling C. pipiens...|$|E
50|$|Cyperus esculentus can {{be found}} wild, as a weed, or as a crop. Evidence exists for its {{cultivation}} in Egypt since the sixth millennium BC, and for several centuries in Southern Europe. In Spain, C. esculentus is cultivated for its edible tubers, called <b>earth</b> <b>almonds</b> or tiger nuts, for the preparation of horchata de chufa, a sweet, milk-like beverage. However, in most other countries, C. esculentus is considered a weed.|$|R
30|$|Tiger nut is a {{perennial}} grass-like plant with spheroid tubers, pale yellow cream kernel {{surrounded by a}} fibrous sheath, which grows to about 90 [*]cm (3.0 [*]ft.) tall, with solitary stems growing from a tuber. It {{is also known as}} yellow nut sedge, <b>earth</b> or ground <b>almonds,</b> “souchet” in French, “ermandeln” in German and “chufa” in Spanish (TTSL 2005). In many countries, Cyperus esculentus is considered a weed (Adejuyitan 2011; Ukwuru and Ogbodo 2011). In Ghana, it grows in the wild, along rivers and are cultivated on a small scale by rural farmers mostly in the Eastern region of the country and parts of central region especially Awutu Obrakyire, Okuse Nkwanta and Bawjiase areas. The planting season in Ghana is between April and May and is mostly irrigated every week. Tubers develop about 6 – 8 [*]weeks after seedling emergence and grow quickly during July and August. Maturity is around 90 – 110 [*]days. The average yield ranges between 10 and 19 [*]t/ha (Pascual-Seva et al. 2016). The nuts are locally called “aya” in Hausa; “atadwe” in Twi and “atangbe” in Ga in the Ghanaian parlance. Tiger nuts are edible, sweet, nutty, flavoured tubers which contain protein, carbohydrate, sugars and lots of oil and fibre. Despite its name and its chemical composition which comprises characteristics of both tubers and nuts, tiger nut is a tuber (Pascual et al. 2000). It has been reported to be a “health” food since its consumption can help prevent heart diseases and thrombosis and is said to activate blood circulation and reduce the risk of colon cancer. The nut or tuber, when processed into milk, comes with varying nutritional and medicinal values similar to chemical compositions contained in nuts and tubers (Kampman et al. 1994; Arafat et al. 2009). Also, according to Mason (2008), tiger nut juice has been recognized for its additional health benefits as they are high in fibre, protein and natural sugars. The milk contains almost twice the quantity of starch as potato or sweet potato tubers (Arafat et al. 2009). It has also been found to possess good therapeutic properties since its consumption is found to be positively related to healthier cholesterol levels (Moore 2004).|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this thesis, {{conformational}} analyses of four odorant molecules with non-planar five-membered ring systems were realized using a combination of quantum chemical calculations and microwave spectroscopy. The gas phase structures of odorant molecules are the basis to understand the structure-odor relationship since the sense of smell starts from gas phase molecules. The knowledge of aromas is important to understand the sense of smelling and to create new flavors. The class of five-membered non-planar rings was chosen because its conformational landscape has two different types of stable geometries, the twist and the envelope structure. Two different conformers and one 34 S-isotopologue were assigned for the molecule 2 -methyltetrahydrothiophene, which is a natural flavor compound found in wine and brandy. The molecule 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran is an eco-friendly solvent and biofuel component as well as a natural flavor molecule in fish sauce and <b>earth</b> <b>almond.</b> Here, its experimental heavy atom positions of its most stable conformer were determined using isotopic substitution. The molecule 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -dithiolane can be found in the roasting aroma of meat and peanut oil. Coffee furanone (2 -methyltetrahydrofuran- 3 -one) is an important volatile compound of the coffee aroma and also a natural flavor in tomato and pork. For these two molecules, the most stable conformer was assigned and compared with quantum chemical calculations. First, sulfur-containing molecules mostly have different olfactory properties compared to their oxygen analogons. Second, functional groups might have different influence on the ring structure. Therefore, the structures of the studied odorant molecules were compared together with 2 -methyltetrahydrothiophen- 3 -one, 2 -methylcyclopentanone, and methylcyclopentane using Cremer-Pople parameters. Stable twist conformers with similar geometries and olfactory properties were found for 2 -methyltetrahydrothiophen- 3 -one and its related molecules coffee furanone and 2 -methylcyclopentanone. On the other hand, stable envelope conformers only exist for 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran, 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -dithiolane, and methylcyclopentane. Finally, most of the calculated transition states have (near-) envelope geometries. In the second part of this thesis, the effect of multiple internal rotations in the class of planar five-membered ring systems was investigated. Microwave spectroscopy is an outstanding tool to study this effect due to its high resolution and extremely high accuracy. The intramolecular dynamics and couplings of internal rotation obtained by microwave spectroscopy are much more accurate than the chemical accuracy of modern quantum chemistry. Therefore, these experimental results can be used for benchmarks. The knowledge of these large amplitude motions is essential in astrophysics to identify new molecules in the interstellar medium. The results can also be used in atmospheric chemistry as references. The investigated series of seven molecules starts with molecules with two equivalent methyl rotors – 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene and 2, 5 -dimethylfuran. Similar torsional barriers like in the monomethyl derivatives 2 -methylthiophene and 2 -methylfuran were found. Crowded spectra were investigated in the molecule 2 -acetyl- 5 -methylfuran. In this molecule, two conformers with two inequivalent methyl rotors were assigned. A dramatic change of one barrier purely due to steric effects of the different conformers was determined. The molecule 4, 5 -dimethylthiazole was chosen to study the effect of coupled large amplitude motions on the torsional barrier. Together with first results on 2, 4 -dimethylthiazole, it could be verified that the coupling of internal rotations reduced drastically the torsional barriers. Additionally, the hyperfine structures due to quadrupole coupling were assigned. The molecule 1, 2, 5 -trimethylpyrrole has three internal rotations and quadrupole coupling. Due to the electronic effects, the barriers of the two equivalent methyl groups are twice as high as calculated for 2, 5 -dimethylpyrrole. On the other hand, the barrier of the N-methyl group has a value below 10 /cm, which is smaller than the one of N-methylpyrrole. Finally, the rotational spectra of the first, to the best of my knowledge, molecule with four internal rotations – 2, 3, 4, 5 -tetramethylthiophene – was studied and assigned. Here, the spectra were highly crowded due to 25 torsional species and unusual barriers were determined. However, these barriers could be verified by the results of the other studied molecules with internal rotations...|$|E
