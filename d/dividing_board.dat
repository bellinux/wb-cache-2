It can also be adapted to indoor recreation if the floor upon which it is played is well padded with old rugs to prevent being damaged with the hockey sticks." [...] "Equipment: Take two pieces boards of lumber 2 inches by 10 inches by 8 or 10 feet cm × 25 cm × 2.4 or 3.0 m, and two end pieces 1 inch by 10 inches by 4 foot cm × 25 cm × 1.2 m and construct a rectangular box fastening it together with spike nails or wagon bed rods. Take another board 2 inches by 10 inches by 4 feet cm × 25 cm × 1.2 m and nail it into the rectangular frame, dividing it into two equal compartments. On the bottom side of the box, cut a hole [...] inches at the base and about [...] inches high cm × 6.4 cm {{in the center of}} each of the end boards, and cut two such holes in the bottom of the <b>dividing</b> <b>board,</b> which make the two equal compartments. These last two holes should be equidistant from the sides of the box. Now get a couple of three-foot cm sticks and an old baseball and you are ready to play. Almost any kind of a stick will do. Saplings cut off underneath the ground so as to get the curve are very good. Also cheap commercial hockey sticks with the blade reinforced with vtirc are excellent." ...|$|E
