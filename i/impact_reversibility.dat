40|$|Purpose: As a {{consequence}} of the multi-functionality of land, the impact assessment of land use in Life Cycle Impact Assessment requires the modelling of several impact pathways covering biodiversity and ecosystem services. To provide consistency amongst these separate impact pathways, general principles for their modelling are provided in this paper. These are refinements to the principles that have already been proposed in publications by the UNEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative. In particular, this paper addresses the calculation of land use interventions and land use impacts, the issue of <b>impact</b> <b>reversibility,</b> the spatial and temporal distribution of such impacts and the assessment of absolute or relative ecosystem quality changes. Based on this, we propose a guideline to build methods for land use impact assessment in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Results: Recommendations are given for the development of new characterization models and for which a series of key elements should explicitly be stated, such as the modelled land use impact pathways, the land use/cover typology covered, the level of biogeographical differentiation used for the characterization factors, the reference land use situation used and if relative or absolute quality changes are used to calculate land use impacts. Moreover, for an application of the characterisation factors (CFs) in an LCA study, data collection should be transparent with respect to the data input required from the land use inventory and the regeneration times. Indications on how generic CFs can be used for the background system as well as how spatial-based CFs can be calculated for the foreground system in a specific LCA study and how land use change is to be allocated should be detailed. Finally, it becomes necessary to justify the modelling period for which land use impacts of land transformation and occupation are calculated and how uncertainty is accounted for. Discussion The presented guideline is based on a number of assumptions: Discrete land use types are sufficient for an assessment of land use impacts; ecosystem quality remains constant over time of occupation; time and area of occupation are substitutable; transformation time is negligible; regeneration is linear and independent from land use history and landscape configuration; biodiversity and multiple ecosystem services are independent; the ecological impact is linearly increasing with the intervention; and there is no interaction between land use and other drivers such as climate change. These assumptions might influence the results of land use Life Cycle Impact Assessment and need to be critically reflected. Conclusions and recommendations In this and the other papers of the special issue, we presented the principles and recommendations for the calculation of land use impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services on a global scale. In the framework of LCA, they are mainly used for the assessment of land use impacts in the background system.

40|$|Reversibility is {{a thread}} woven through many {{branches}} of mathematics. It arises in dynamics, in systems that admit a time-reversal symmetry, and in group theory where the reversible group elements {{are those that}} are conjugate to their inverses. However, the lack of a lingua franca for discussing reversibility means that researchers who encounter the concept may be unaware of related work in other fields. This text is the first to make reversibility the focus of attention. The authors fix standard notation and terminology, establish the basic common principles, and illustrate the <b>impact</b> of <b>reversibility</b> in such diverse areas as group theory, differential and analytic geometry, number theory, complex analysis and approximation theory. As well as showing connections between different fields, the authors' viewpoint reveals many open questions, making this book ideal for graduate students and researchers. The exposition is accessible to readers at the advanced undergraduate level and above...|$|R
2500|$|The Fishery Manager's Guidebook {{issued in}} 2009 by the FAO of the United Nations, advises that the precautionary {{approach}} or principle {{should be applied}} when [...] "ecosystem resilience and human <b>impact</b> (including <b>reversibility)</b> are difficult to forecast and hard to distinguish from natural changes." [...] The precautionary principle suggests that when an action risks harm, {{it should not be}} proceeded with until it can be scientifically proven to be safe. Historically fishery managers have applied this principle the other way round; fishing activities have not been curtailed [...] until it has been proven that they have already damaged existing ecosystems. In a paper published in 2007, Shertzer and Prager suggested that there can be significant benefits to stock biomass and fishery yield if management is stricter and more prompt. This is supported by recent work on the management of North Sea fisheries in accordance with ranges of acceptable fishing, where fishing {{at the top of the}} [...] "acceptable" [...] ranges is many times more risky than fishing near the bottom, but delivers only 20% more yield.|$|R

40|$|Recent declining {{levels of}} acid {{deposition}} in both North America and Europe have initiated reversal of acidification and recovery of <b>impacted</b> ecosystems. The <b>reversibility</b> of acidification {{has also been}} investigated by means of large-scale experiments with whole ecosystems. Predictive models can account {{for much of this}} empirical and experimental data, at least at coarse spatial and temporal scales. Discrepancies between observed and predicted effects are {{due in part to the}} increasingly important role of nitrogen in soil and water acidification. "Nitrogen saturation" threatens to offset the incipient recovery due to reductions in SO 2 emissions. Possible ecosystem impacts of future climate change add further uncertainty to predictions of long-term acidifications trends...|$|R
40|$|The H 2 bubbles {{resulting}} from the reaction of freshly prepared Si powders with water were found to impede the large-scale preparation of aqueous-based Si/CMC (Na-Carboxy-Methyl-Cellulose) /C slurries and could consequently prevent the large-scale production of composite electrode films. To understand and possibly control this reaction, silicon particles (Siref) have been partially oxidized either by contact with water or by air heating at elevated temperatures. By coupling kinetics, XRD, (HR) TEM/EELS, TGA/DSC, IR and gas adsorption data, the porosity/texture/surface chemistry of the resulting silica-based coating layers {{were found to be}} highly dependent on the oxidation process, while the extent of oxidation is tuned by the time-temperature of the treatment. Although fully oxidized samples are totally inactive vs. Li, the high porosity of the water-formed silica coating contrasts with the dense air-formed one that can limit access to the Si core and can block its reactivity if too thick. Controlled and optimized air-oxidative pre-treatments can prevent the H 2 evolution during the slurry preparation, hence enabling the reproducible production of high-quality electrode coatings on Cu current collectors. Such treatments do not <b>impact</b> the <b>reversibility</b> of the Si-Li electrochemical reaction, even with no capacity constraints and with or without FEC addition in commercial EC/DMC/LiPF 6 electrolytes...|$|R
40|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief many choice options {{and the ability to}} reverse one's initial choice are {{sometimes}} associated with decreased chooser satisfaction. Two studies investigated the role of counterfactual thinking in explaining these paradoxes. Participants chose drawing implements from either a limited (6) or extensive (24) choice set (Study 1), or an expected reversible/non-reversible selection (Study 2). Following a drawing task, satisfaction with their chosen implement was rated under either high or low cognitive load to manipulate the availability of counterfactual alternatives. In Study 1 satisfaction was higher with limited vs. extensive choice under low load. The number of counterfactuals generated mediated this effect. Under high load the pattern was reversed. Participants in Study 2 generated more counterfactuals when reversibility was expected under low but not high load and this partially mediated the <b>impact</b> of expected <b>reversibility</b> on revealed satisfaction. Implications for theoretical understanding of these paradoxes are discussed. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Delirium poses {{a common}} and multifactorial {{complication}} in older patients with cancer. Delirium independently contributes to poorer clinical outcomes and impedes communication between patients with cancer, {{their family and}} health care providers. Because of its clinical <b>impact</b> and potential <b>reversibility,</b> efforts for prevention, early recognition or prompt treatment are critical. However, nurses {{and other health care}} providers often fail to recognize delirium or misattribute its symptoms to dementia, depression or old age. Yet, failure to determine an individual's risk for delirium can initiate the cascade of negative events causing additional distress for patients, family and health care providers alike. Therefore, parameters for determining an individual's risk for delirium and guidelines for the routine and systematic assessment of cognitive functioning are provided to form a basis for the prompt and accurate diagnosis of delirium. Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of delirium are also discussed. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Here I {{discuss how}} {{vulnerability}} assessment {{could be used}} for coastal lagoons. However, this has to take into account that many coastal lagoons have already been impacted by other forcings, like eutrophication. Vulnerability is not a well-defined concept in mainstream ecology and as a result, ecologists are poorly prepared to address vulnerability assessments. I make some proposals on how ecologists could define and use vulnerability in ecology and how ecologists can make pertinent contributions to vulnerability assessments in a multidisciplinary setting. Accordingly: 1 - vulnerability can be applied to systems of different levels of integration in biology and ecology. 2 - vulnerability is the risk that individuals, populations, species and ecological systems can be harmed, severely damaged or destroyed by environmental hazards and long-term environmental changes, while the intensity of the vulnerability could accommodate for a description of the extent of the <b>impacts</b> and their <b>reversibility</b> or irreversibility. 3 - adaptation is a key concept in vulnerability assessment, which distinguishes it from the preceding approaches like impact and risk assessments 4 - approaches and concepts, like “Desired States” and trajectories appear very useful in this context particularly if the management needs to target both the improvement of current situation and the vulnerability to environmental change...|$|R
40|$|Si/C/CMC {{composite}} for electrodes (Na-Carboxy-Methyl-Cellulose) appear {{today as}} the most promising strategy in view of substituting carbonaceous materials for silicon as negative active material in Li-ion batteries, hence the need to understand their reaction mechanism. By means of solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy, we confirmed that CMC chains can bind to Si via covalent or hydrogen bonding depending upon the pH of the mother suspension. Through coupled in situ Scanning Electron Microscopy and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy observations of such electrodes reacting with Li, we demonstrated the ability of their porosity to buffer the Si swelling up to 1. 7 - 2 Li/Si, further lithiation resulting in internal reorganization with either a definitive break of the covalent CMC-Si bond, or preservation of both the texture and electric wiring {{in the case of}} weaker Si-CMC hydrogen bonding thanks to a self-healing process. A relationship between the nature of the Si-CMC bonding and the electrode performance was found with a very positive impact of hydrogen interaction as 100 cycles could be achieved with preservation of the initial texture and excellent retention (3000 mAh/g Si after 100 cycles). Besides, we demonstrated that an alteration in the electrode texture/porosity, by a freeze-drying process, also <b>impacts</b> the electrode <b>reversibility.</b> © 2011 The Electrochemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: In recent decades, {{drug abuse}} {{has been one}} of the most {{important}} problems of human societies and has been imposing enormous charges to them. Exposing addicts to infectious diseases, social and economic harmful <b>impacts,</b> expensive and <b>reversibility</b> of treatment methods have caused that drug abuse prevention programs be more inexpensive and more effective than treatment. One of the most important methods of drug abuse prevention is identification and prioritization of them according to scientific methods. The purpose of this study was to investigate addiction prevention methods among adolescents and teenagers from the viewpoints of addicts, their parents, authorities and prioritizing the prevention methods based on analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model in Delfan city, Iran. Methods: Statistical samples included 17 authorities, 42 addicts, and 23 parents that have been selected through purposive sampling. Data collection instruments involved structured and semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed based on quantitative and qualitative methods, encoding and categorization. In this study, AHP model was used for prioritizing the prevention methods. This model is one of the most efficient and comprehensive designed techniques for multi-criteria decision making; it formulates the possibility of natural complex problems as hierarchy. Findings: The results indicated that the most important methods of drug abuse prevention were using media, case studies, planning for leisure times, educating social skills, integrating drug prevention methods in religious customs and respect to teenagers. Among these factors, the media and respect to adolescents with weights 0. 3321 and 0. 2389 had the highest preferences for the prevention of drug addiction, respectively. Planning for leisure time with weight of 0. 1349 had the lowest importance than media and teenager respectful factor and higher priority than religion customs, dating and learning lessons factors. On the contrary, integrating in religion customs, using case studies with weights 0. 1145, 0. 1114 and 0. 0680 had the lowest preferences, respectively, and can be considered in later settings. Conclusion: The interviewees mentioned the most important addiction prevention methods in respect to teenagers, religious customs, media, dating skills, learning lessons from examples and attention to the leisure times among which the media has been the most efficient method. Because, publicity of the media as a national media is available to the public and it is not dedicated for a special group or class of people and everyone can use it regardless of his literacy and knowledge level...|$|R
40|$|This {{program was}} {{dedicated}} to understanding the effect of impurities on Long-Term Thermal Cycling and aging properties of Complex Hydrides for Hydrogen Storage. At {{the start of the}} program we found reversibility between Li 2 NH+LiH  LiH+LiNH 2 (yielding ~ 5. 8 wt. %H capacity). Then we tested the effect of impurity in H 2 gas by pressure cycling at 255 oC; first with industrial gas containing ppm levels of O 2 and H 2 O as major impurities. Both these impurities had a significant <b>impact</b> on the <b>reversibility</b> and decreased the capacity by 2. 65 wt. %H. Further increase in number of cycles from 500 to 1100 showed only a 0. 2 wt%H more weight loss, showing some capacity is still maintained after a significant number of cycles. The loss of capacity is attributed to the formation of ~ 55 wt% LiH and ~ 30 % Li 2 O, as major contaminant phases, along with the hydride Li 2 NH phase; suggesting loss of nitrogen during cycling. The effect of 100 ppm H 2 O in H 2 also showed a decrease of ~ 2. 5 wt. %H (after 560 cycles), and 100 ppm O 2 in H 2; a loss of ~ 4. 1 wt. %. Methane impurity (100 ppm, 100 cycles), showed a very small capacity loss of 0. 9 wt. %H under similar conditions. However, when Li 3 N was pressure cycled with 100 ppmN 2 -H 2 there were beneficial effects were observed (255 oC); the reversible capacity increased to 8. 4 wt. %H after 853 cycles. Furthermore, with 20 mol. %N 2 -H 2 capacity increased to ~ 10 wt. %H after 516 cycles. We attribute this enhancement to the reaction of nitrogen with liquid lithium during cycling as the Gibbs free energy of formation of Li 3 N (Go = - 98. 7 kJ/mol) is more negative than that of LiH (Go = - 50. 3 kJ/mol). We propose that the mitigation of hydrogen capacity losses is due to the destabilization of the LiH phase that tends to accumulate during cycling. Also more Li 2 NH phase was found in the cycled product. Mixed Alanates (3 LiNH 2 :Li 3 AlH 6) showed that 7 wt% hydrogen desorbed under dynamic vacuum. Equilibrium experiments (maximum 12 bar H 2) showed up to 4 wt% hydrogen reversibly stored in the material after the first desorption. The activation energy was found to be 51 kJ/mol, as compared to 81 kJ/mol for pure lithium alanate. It is proposed that based on the data obtained and CALPHAD modeling that the improvement in cycling is due to the formation of pure lithium (liquid at 255 oC), which is able to react with nitrogen specifically forming Li 3 N. The presence of nitrogen in the 80 / 20 molar mixtures in a hydride bed along with hydrogen causes Li to form Li 3 N rather than LiH, and subsequently regenerates the Li 2 NH phase and yields a ~ 10 wt. %H reversibly...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} part {{goes over}} the discovery of frustrated Lewis pairs, and their use in catalysis to effect hydrogenation. It spans the road from simple hydrogen activation to asymmetric hydrogenation of substrates. The topic is limited to substrates with polar double bonds and amino- and phosphinoboranes as catalysts. The research comes in three parts. The first part was catalysis testing a newly found aminoborane in hydrogenation reactions in mild conditions. This entailed relatively normal laboratory glassware: Schlenk tubes and the Schlenk line to provide the inert gas atmosphere {{and of course the}} hydrogen gas itself. The second and third part are concerned with catalyst synthesis. The second was attempting to create Lewis acids {{in the image of the}} catalyst in the first part, to gain more insight of the effects of the structure of the acid. The third similarly was concerned with creating a new variant of an already existing catalyst to see whether minor tweaking of its structure might improve its performance. For the second and third parts however, the synthesis was quite difficult, and catalysis was never reached. Based on literature it was found that adduct formation did not necessarily exclude hydrogen activation, but that an equilibrium state was necessary for them to co-exist. However, sterically demanding environment was no longer a requirement for both the acid and base. For the reversible reaction to be feasible, the acid and base mustn't have too much affinity to their half of the hydrogen molecule. It seems that the acid has more <b>impact</b> on the <b>reversibility</b> of hydrogen activation, and it may be possible to modify an acid to make an irreversible activation reaction reversible. For enantioselective catalysis, the catalyst itself must introduce the element of chirality to the system, so that it may favour one orientation of the substrate over the other. Whether chiral or not, it seems clear that a hindered catalyst will prefer unhindered substrates and vice versa. This allows us to choose an appropriate catalyst for the substrate we have in mind. To that end, it is a good thing to have a spectrum of catalysts: specific tools for specific jobs. In designing new chiral catalysts, it seems one needs to consider how to implement the element of chirality to the structure, the electronic and steric conditions, and the acidity and basicity of the acid and base groups. Especially worth considering are the 4 - and 6 -membered rings that form in the catalyst before and after hydrogen activation. 6 -membered rings in the salt are especially worth avoiding. The catalysis testing yielded preliminary results and guided the path to finding the most optimal conditions for each substrate tested. One of the catalysis syntheses suffered from straightforward difficulties in synthesis and purification, and larger, more complicated Lewis acids of similar structure have already been synthesized. Thus it doesn't seem likely that this particular branch of study is worth the effort, certainly not commercially. The other catalysis synthesis had the most difficulty in separating the diastereomers, which was time consuming. Therefore that branch doesn't seem very practical either...|$|R
