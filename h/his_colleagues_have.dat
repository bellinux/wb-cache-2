25|$|Wilson and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>have</b> {{simulated}} {{the human}} whistle {{by creating a}} cylinder 2.04 inches in diameter with a rounded orifice at one end that supplied a jet and another rounded orifice {{at the other end}} of the same diameter and on the same axis. The geometry was very similar to that of the tea pot whistle. After a number of tests at various speeds, orifice diameters, and orifice thicknesses, they concluded that the whistle was created by a Helmholtz resonance in the cylinder volume. There was enough data for one case in their study to calculate the Strouhal and Reynolds numbers. The results are shown in the figure on the right.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the course}} of the experiment, Lenski and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>have</b> {{reported}} a wide array of phenotypic and genotypic changes in the evolving populations. These have included changes that have occurred in all 12 populations and others that have only appeared in one or a few populations. For example, all 12 populations showed a similar pattern of rapid improvement in fitness that decelerated over time, faster growth rates, and increased cell size. Half of the populations have evolved defects in DNA repair that have caused mutator phenotypes marked by elevated mutation rates. The most striking adaptation reported so far is the evolution of aerobic growth on citrate, which is unusual in E. coli, in one population at some point between generations 31,000 and 31,500.|$|E
25|$|Reddy's early {{research}} was conducted at the AI labs at Stanford, first {{as a graduate student}} and later as an Assistant Professor, and at CMU since 1969. His AI research concentrated on perceptual and motor aspect of intelligence such as speech, language, vision and robotics. Over a span of five decades, Reddy and his colleagues created several historic demonstrations of spoken language systems, e.g., voice control of a robot, large vocabulary connected speech recognition, speaker independent speech recognition, and unrestricted vocabulary dictation. Reddy and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>have</b> made seminal contributions to Task Oriented Computer Architectures, Analysis of Natural Scenes, Universal Access to Information, and Autonomous Robotic Systems. Hearsay I {{was one of the first}} systems capable of continuous speech recognition.

In their scenario, 50 million years from now the Mediterranean sea may vanish and the collision between Europe and Africa will create a long mountain range extending to the current location of the Persian Gulf. Australia will merge with Indonesia, and Baja California will slide northward along the coast. New subduction zones may appear off the eastern coast of North and South America, and mountain chains will form along those coastlines. To the south, the migration of Antarctica to the north will cause all of its ice sheets to melt.

500|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown that {{activity}} in primary sensory areas of the brain is not sufficient to produce consciousness: [...] it is possible for subjects to report a lack of awareness even when areas such as the primary visual cortex show clear electrical responses to a stimulus. [...] Higher brain areas are seen as more promising, especially the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in a range of higher cognitive functions collectively known as executive functions. [...] There is substantial evidence that a [...] "top-down" [...] flow of neural activity (i.e., activity propagating from the frontal cortex to sensory areas) is more predictive of conscious awareness than a [...] "bottom-up" [...] flow of activity. [...] The prefrontal cortex is not the only candidate area, however: [...] studies by Nikos Logothetis and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>have</b> shown, for example, that visually responsive neurons in parts of the temporal lobe reflect the visual perception in the situation when conflicting visual images are presented to different eyes (i.e., bistable percepts during binocular rivalry).|$|E
