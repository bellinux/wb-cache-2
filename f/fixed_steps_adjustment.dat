However, the ability to make <b>step</b> <b>adjustments</b> may be compromised when the walker’s attentional capacity is limited. This study compared the effects of aging and dual tasking on <b>step</b> <b>adjustments</b> in response to stepping-target perturbations during visually cued treadmill walking. Fifteen older adults (69. 4 ± 5. 0 years; mean ± SD) and fifteen young adults (25. 4 ± 3. 0 years) walked at a speed of 3 km/h on a treadmill. Both groups performed visually cued <b>step</b> <b>adjustments</b> in response to unpredictable shifts of projected stepping targets in forward (FW), backward (BW) or sideward (SW) directions, at different levels of task difficulty [which increased as the available response distance (ARD) decreased], and with and without dual tasking (auditory Stroop task). In both groups, <b>step</b> <b>adjustments</b> were smaller than required. For FW and BW shifts, older adults undershot more under dual-task conditions. For these shifts, ARD affected the age groups differentially. For SW shifts, larger errors were found for older adults, dual tasking and the most difficult ARD. Stroop task performance did not differ between groups in all conditions. Older adults have more difficulty than young adults to make corrective <b>step</b> <b>adjustments</b> while walking, especially under dual-tasking conditions. Furthermore, they seemed to prioritize the cognitive task over the <b>step</b> <b>adjustment</b> task, a strategy that may pose aging populations at a greater fall risk. For comparable task difficulty, the older adults performed considerably worse than the young adults, indicating a decreased ability to adjust steps under time pressure...|$|R

However, {{only for the}} simplest preconditioned eigensolver, namely the preconditioned gradient iteration (or preconditioned inverse iteration) with <b>fixed</b> <b>step</b> size, sharp non-asymptotic convergence estimates are known and these estimates require an ideally scaled preconditioner.

The new estimate always improves that of the <b>fixed</b> <b>step</b> size iteration. The practical importance of this new estimate is that arbitrarily scaled preconditioners can be used.
