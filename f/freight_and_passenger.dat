5|$|By 1872, the {{railroad}} had extended from Portland to Roseburg. Along the way, it created growth in Willamette Valley {{towns such as}} Canby, Aurora, and Harrisburg, which emerged as <b>freight</b> <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> stations, and provided a commercial lifeline to {{the part of the}} river valley above Harrisburg where steamships were rarely able to travel. As {{the railroad}} made its way into the Umpqua Valley, new townsites such as Drain, Oakland, and Yoncalla were laid out.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1884, the B and the Philadelphia-based Pennsylvania Railroad both {{used the}} {{independent}} Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad (PW) between Baltimore, Maryland, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for their New YorkWashington <b>freight</b> <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> trains. In 1881, the Pennsylvania Railroad purchased a controlling {{interest in the}} PW, and in 1884 it denied the B further use of the PW to reach Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|The planned railway had two tracks {{each for}} <b>freight</b> <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> traffic. Having taken similar {{projects}} in London and New York City into consideration, passenger traffic received priority over freight trains. Furthermore, the new railway line {{was not only}} {{to serve as a}} connection between the mainline terminii in Berlin, but would also offer connections to the Berlin Ringbahn and the suburban rail lines.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, the Norwegian State Railways sought a new {{locomotive}} type to replace its aging fleet of Di 3 diesel-electric locomotives, which {{made up the}} back-bone of the dieselized operations. The new locomotives were planned for use as <b>freight</b> <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> trains on the Nordland Line, {{and to a lesser}} extent on the Røros Line. In 1980, NSB had taken delivery of five Di4 from Henschel. Originally there were plans to order additional Di 4 units, but this was discarded and instead a new class was pursued, as NSB wanted similar, but slightly more modern, locomotives.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for the Old Bay Line, its <b>freight</b> <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> traffic {{remained}} relatively {{strong in the}} 1930s and the company embarked on a modernization program for its main boats of the line. The President Warfield and State of Maryland were converted from coal to oil burning in 1933 and had sprinkler systems installed in 1938. In 1939, the State of Virginia was converted to oil burning and all three ships were equipped with radio direction finders and ship-to-shore telephones.|$|E

5|$|Railroads {{reached their}} {{maturity}} {{in the early}} 20th century, as trains carried the bulk of land <b>freight</b> <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> traffic in the industrialized countries of the world. By the mid-20th century, however, they had lost their preeminent position. The private automobile had replaced the railroad for short passenger trips, while the airplane had usurped it for long-distance travel, especially in the United States. Railroads remained effective, however, for transporting people in high-volume situations, such as commuting between the centres of large cities and their suburbs, and medium-distance travel of less than about 300 miles between urban centres.|$|E
5|$|Alternate plans {{included}} constructing {{two sets}} of two tubes, one for commuter and freight service from the LIRR {{and the other for}} rapid transit, or two tunnels each with individual tubes for freight and subway service. The freight service would have occurred during off-peak hours only, but simultaneous with subway service, with passenger trains running in 30-minute or one-hour headways during these times. A 1912 proposal had freight running at night between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., while the 1925 plans called for joint <b>freight</b> <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> service during early mornings (5 a.m. to 6 a.m.), middays (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.), and overnights (8 p.m. to 5 a.m.).|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{the station}} was finally closed when Conrail and the newly formed Metro-North Railroad {{announced}} that the new stations along the Erie's former high speed freight line, the Graham Line, would take over <b>freight</b> <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> service. Trains to Harriman would stop at a new park-and-ride built to the south. The former 1911 station depot, however, remained standing until 2006, when the Harriman village building inspector forced the new owners of the right-of-way for the old main line, Norfolk Southern, to either revamp or demolish the former station depot. The railway chose the latter, and in May 2006, a excavator tore down the 1911 depot, with the remains taken to a dump in nearby Hillburn.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the Civil War, when hostilities sharply curtailed business on the Old Bay Line, World War I doubled <b>freight</b> <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> business {{on the line to}} the busy ports of Norfolk and the Hampton Roads area, with 107,664 passengers using the line in 1917. As a result of congestion on the nation's railroads and ports when the U.S. entered the war in April 1917, the Federal government established the wartime U.S. Railroad Administration (USRA) to take charge of railroads and steamship companies, including the Baltimore Steam Packet Company. The USRA directed the operations of the Old Bay Line and the rival Chesapeake line {{for the duration of the}} war and more than a year thereafter, until March 1, 1920.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania Railroad 4859 is a GG1-class {{electric}} locomotive {{located in the}} Harrisburg Transportation Center in Harrisburg in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It was operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad and its successors, Penn Central and Conrail. 4859 pulled the first electrically powered train from Philadelphia to Harrisburg on January15, 1938. It was used in various <b>freight</b> <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> service until November22, 1979, when it pulled the last GG1-powered freight train on November22, 1979. Originally located in Strasburg, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 and was moved to its current location in 1986. It was designated the state {{electric locomotive}} of Pennsylvania in 1987 by the Pennsylvania General Assembly and was re-listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The Severn Railway Bridge (historically {{called the}} Severn Bridge) was a bridge {{carrying}} the railway across the River Severn between Sharpness and Lydney, Gloucestershire. It {{was built in}} the 1870s by the Severn Bridge Railway Company, primarily to carry coal from the Forest of Dean to the docks at Sharpness; at that time it was the furthest downstream bridge over the Severn. The company was taken over in 1893 by the Great Western Railway and the Midland Railway Companies when it got into financial difficulties. The bridge continued to be used for <b>freight</b> <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> services until 1960, and saw temporary extra traffic on the occasions that the Severn Tunnel was closed for engineering work.|$|E

5|$|The last {{passenger}} trains {{on both the}} North Shore Branch and the South Beach Branch ran on March 31, 1953. The right-of-way of the South Beach Branch was eventually de-mapped and the tracks have been removed. On June 24, 2001, a small section of the easternmost portion of the North Shore Branch (a few hundred feet) was reopened to provide passenger service to the new Richmond County Bank Ballpark, home of the Staten Island Yankees minor-league baseball team; however, this service was discontinued on June 18, 2010. Plans to reopen {{the remainder of the}} North Shore Branch, to both <b>freight</b> <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> service, are being studied, with one plan calling for the line to resume full operations between St. George and Arlington or Port Ivory.|$|E
5|$|The {{modifications}} {{are attributed}} to Maunsell’s Chief Draughtsman James Clayton, who had transferred to Ashford railway works in 1914 from Derby works. They {{were the result of}} cooperation between the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) and the Great Western Railway (GWR) when Maunsell was seconded to the Railway Executive Committee during the First World War. The aim was to create a series of standard <b>freight</b> <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> locomotives for use throughout Britain, and meant that Clayton was privy to the latest GWR developments in steam design. These included streamlined steam passages, long-travel valves, the maximisation of power through reduced cylinder sizes and higher boiler pressure.|$|E
5|$|By 1880 {{the railway}} had six {{locomotives}} at its disposal. No. 1–2 were Class 14 that were intended as helping {{power to get}} trains up the steep climb from Gudå to Storlien. No. 3–6 were Class 9 locomotives that would do the main haulage from Gudå into Trondheim. In 1883, NSB's other two Class 14 locomotives were transferred from the Smaalenene Line. The initial fleet consisted of 24 passenger and nine breaking cars, all from Skabo. The line featured the first bogie cars in the country, with a single entrance {{at the end of}} each car, instead of individual doors for each compartment. There were also 37 closed freight cars, 40 lumber cars, 20 boxcars, 100 flatcars and three milk cars. At first all trains were mixed <b>freight</b> <b>and</b> <b>passenger.</b>|$|E
