This invention relates to a combustion chamber in which mixed oxidizing and combustible gases or vapors may be continuously burned.

40|$|Perturbations in {{the rate}} of fuel flow from the {{injector}} into the combustor can directly affect unsteady motions in the combustor. Therefore, understanding the dynamic characteristics of the injector is important in the effort to control these phenomena. An experimental study on the dynamic response of a pressure-swirl injector under low frequency pressure oscillation conditions was carried out using a pulse valve and the three-microphone technique. Liquid kerosene was used as the fuel and the <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> line was designed for fuel flow modulations up to 200 Hz. Acoustic pressure and specific acoustic impedance were obtained within the <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> line. The magnitude of the specific acoustic impedance with respect to frequencies was varied by the static pressure in the fuel tubing. A normalized fuel transfer function between mass flow rate and acoustic pressure fluctuations was obtained in the frequency range between 10 and 200 Hz. Its gain shows a tendency to increase with frequency. The phase of the normalized fuel flow rate fluctuation at the injector exit was also measured. The phase tends to decrease with increase in frequency, and it approaches 180 degrees out of phase with the pressure fluctuations at 200 Hz within the <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> line...|$|R
40|$|The {{abundant}} {{availability of}} biomass solid wastes in Malaysia such as palm shells {{from the oil}} palm industry promotes diversified research fields for its utilization. This paper investigates {{the application of a}} cascading hearth staged combustor to palm shells combustion in terms of <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> rate effect on temperature profiles. The application of a two-step hearth setup at primary stage combustion offers wider alternatives for solid phase combustion processes. Initial combustion studies of palm shells by controlled air combustion conditions using these set-ups show promising results for further development. Controlled air conditions promote gasification of the solid fuel and significantly lower combustor temperatures below 500 oC. Varying the <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> at 0. 1, 0. 15 and 0. 2 kg/min with constant air supply of 227 liters/min (8 CFM) and good fuel distribution on the hearth leads to fuel core temperatures exceeding 1000 oC. As a result of high core temperatures, release rates of volatiles and combustible gases increases which influences attainable secondary combustion temperatures. The maximum secondary stage combustion exhaust temperature recorded was 490 oC at 0. 2 kg/min <b>fuel</b> <b>feed,</b> a secondary air supply of 42. 5 liters/min (1. 5 CFM) and a corresponding fuel core temperature of 1225 oC...|$|R

40|$|New process {{concepts}} in energy production and biofuel, which {{are much more}} reactive than coal, call for better controllability of the combustion in circulating fluidized bed boilers. Simplified analysis describing the dynamics of combustion in fluidized bed and circulating fluidized bed boilers is presented. Simple formulas for the estimation of {{the responses of the}} burning rate and fuel inventory to changes in <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding</b> are presented. Different changes in the <b>fuel</b> <b>feed,</b> such as an impulse, step change, linear increase and cyclic variation are considered. The dynamics of the burning with a change in the feed rate depends on the fuel reactivity and particle size. The response of a fuel mixture with a wide particle size distribution can be found by summing up the effect of different fuel components and size fractions. Methods to extract reaction parameters form dynamic tests in laboratory scale reactors are discussed. The residence time of fuel particles in the bed and the resulting char inventory in the bed decrease with increasing fuel reactivity and differences between coal and biomass is studied. The char inventory affects the stability of combustion. The effect of char inventory and oscillations in the <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> on the oscillation of the flue gas oxygen concentration is studied by model calculation.

40|$|Chemical-looping {{combustion}} (CLC) is a combustion concept with inherent {{separation of}} CO 2. The process uses a solid oxygen carrier, {{which consists of}} metal oxide, to transfer the oxygen from air to fuel. The chemical-looping combustor {{used in the present}} experiments features two interconnected fluidized beds; a fuel reactor (FR) and an air reactor (AR). In the FR, fuel is gasified with steam whereupon gasification products react with the oxygen carrier to form, ideally, CO 2 and H 2 O. This study concerns CLC of solid fuels in a continuously operating 10 kW unit using two natural ores as oxygen carrier: (a) ilmenite, an iron–titanium mineral and (b) a manganese ore containing smaller amounts of Fe, Al and Si. The <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> was re-designed in order to increase contact between oxygen carrier and fuel. The new in-bed <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> was found to significantly improve gas conversion, mainly caused by increased contact between the oxygen carrier and volatile gases released in the fuel chute. Two fuels were used to evaluate the effect of fuel feed; a bituminous coal and a pet coke. The in-bed <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> was used when ilmenite and manganese ore were compared. The use of a manganese ore as oxygen carrier was shown to significantly enhance the rate of char gasification and also improve gas conversion.

The cause of the high strain was traced to a period of unsteady flow separation during the start and cutoff of each test coincident with the oblique shock approaching the nozzle exit.

Combustion profiles for coal, wood and peat, measured at the VTT Processes Pilot circulating fluidized bed reactor, have been compared.
