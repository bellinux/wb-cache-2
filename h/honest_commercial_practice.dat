40|$|AbstractUnfair <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> Directive {{remains one}} of the most ambitious acts of {{secondary}} legislation adopted in the field of consumer protection over the past decade. This legal instrument seeks to establish a common European understanding of “unfairness” in business-to-consumer legal relations. Hereby Directive introduced a comprehensive regulatory regime applied to all types of commercial activities that can influence the economic behavior of consumers, covering any business-to-consumer <b>commercial</b> <b>practice</b> before, during and after a transaction, thus including marketing, negotiation, sales practices and after-sales conduct. Unfair <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> Directive into Lithuanian legal system was transposed by adopting a completely new legal act – Law on Prohibition of Unfair Business-to-Consumer <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> of the Republic of Lithuania. The implementation of the Unfair <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> Directive in Lithuania led to a split-up between misleading business-to-consumer <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> and misleading business-to-business advertising regulation regimes. Implementing act among other rules introduced into the national legal system provisions on the prohibition of misleading <b>commercial</b> <b>practices,</b> ensuring that consumers are not misled, thus enabling them to make informed and reasonable choices. The purpose of this article is to examine the norms of national act, implementing the prohibition of misleading <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> into the national legal system in the context of implementing provisions of the other Member States and to reveal core national regulation and application problems. Also, having in mind that in the text of the Directive a distinction between misleading actions and misleading omissions is made, it is analyzed whether the clear line between the application of these rules is made in legal practice. In conclusion authors formulate key recommendations for consumer protection institutions and courts, applying the rules on misleading <b>commercial</b> <b>practices...</b>|$|R

Each section compares the European protection of aggressive <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> (and also through European legislation implemented in Czech law) with the protection of those practices in U. S. law. The first part of thesis deals with the protection of consumers against aggressive <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> In European law it mainly regulated by Directive on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> The Directive is implemented in Czech Republic in mainly in Consumer Protection Code and in the Advertising Code. Private protection against aggressive <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> is embodied in provision of unfair competition of the Commercial Code. Protection of personality, privacy and personal data is another form of protection against aggressive practices. In U. S. law, public consumer protection is represented by Federal Trade Commission. In private law, consumers seek redress in court through actions for torts. In relations between competitors is the protection against aggressive <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> regulated by unfair competition and by antirust law. Antitrust law in European Union is represented by 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty. Unfair Competition Law in the U. S. in the B 2 B market is the part of business torts. Antitrust law is represented by Federal Trade Commission and the Ministry of Justice.

40|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the European directive on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices,</b> its provisions started to apply alongside the existing sector-specific European legislation on consumer protection. With the aim of ensuring a coherent system of European consumer law, the directive stated that, in the case of conflict between its rules and other Community law regulating specific aspects of unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices,</b> the latter shall prevail and apply to those aspects. The directive, however, did not mandate any enforcement mechanism at the national level. The Italian legislation which implemented the European directive conferred a general enforcement power on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> to the national antitrust authority. Italian law was not, however, very clear regarding the competence of the agency in markets subject to the oversight of a different sector-specific authority. This issue was raised before the Italian administrative law Court which, at first, seemed to limit the general competence of the antitrust authority in fields where the contested practices were also considered by sector-specific regulation. For this reason, the European Commission started an infringement proceeding against Italy for not having correctly implemented the directive on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> As a consequence, a recent reform in Italian law conferred the antitrust authority an exclusive competence to combat unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> also in regulated sectors, after having consulted the sector-specific regulator, apart when the breach of sector-specific regulation does not result in an unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practice.</b> After {{the adoption}} of this provision, the Italian administrative judge finally interpreted the law on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practice</b> consistently with the European directive. The Court denied that {{the adoption of}} secondary legislation by a national sector-specific regulators can exclude the application of the general provisions on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> and affirmed the relevant enforcement competence of the antitrust authority also in regulated sectors. In the light of these different approaches, this paper will attempt to examine the benefits and the drawbacks of the enforcement mechanisms endorsed by the Italian Courts and legislator. The aim of the work is to assess, from a legal perspective, which role should the general antitrust authority play in the enforcement of unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> in markets subject to sector-specific regulation. </p...|$|R

The discussion of the consequences of this division are crucial for a better analysis of the actual implementation of the EU Directive 2005 / 29 /CE on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> In the third chapter, the scope of application of this Directive is analysed and the main principles of regulation are described. The final section focuses on the Czech law on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> In this segment, the text of the provisions of the Czech Code of Consumer Protection is compared to the Directive, and the system of legal redress and sanctions in the Code of Consumer Protection is critically analysed.

40|$|The {{present study}} begins by the {{analysis}} of the Directive 2005 / 29 /EC, its ratio, its genesis, and its systemic profile concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices; this Directive establishes minimum criteria for harmonizing the legislation of the Member States through which the EC wanted to contribute “to the proper functioning of the internal market”, and also (according to article 153 EC Tr.) to “achieve a high level of consumer protection” (Directive’s article 1) and also approaches the phenomenon of <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> as a exclusive issue of business-to-consumer relationship, demanding the Member States to take into consideration the non direct connected interests of competitors. The cases approached by the Directive discipline are all and only those which can be leaded inside the notion of “business-to-consumer commercial practices”, definition by itself of imprecise boundaries, which can mean (ex art. 2, letter. b e art. 3, par. 1) any professional practice – before, in a given context or also following the contractual relationship between a trader and a consumer – that promotes the conclusion of a contract with a consumer, or even so “directivly connected” to thereof contracts. In reference of those cases, in the first place, the directive establishes to the traders of all Member States a general prohibition of business practice which could be “harming [to] consumers' economic interests” and qualified as “unfair” (art. 5, par. 1). In second place, the Directive contemplates and disciplines in an analytical way the complex system of evaluation of the “unfair” characteristic of a business practice, informing the parameters by which one can consider a business practice to be permitted (while fair), inside the whole European Union (art. 5 to 9) : such evaluation system is articled around a general (and residual) notion concerning unfair business-to-consumer <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> (art. 5, par. 2), two categories of “misleading” <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> (artt. 6 e 7) and “aggressive” (artt. 8 e 9) and a so called “black” list of <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> which “are in all circumstances unfair” (art. 5, par. 5). In third and last place, the Directive trusts to Member States the task of providing adequate solutions (also procedural) to prevent and repress unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices,</b> and also the task of introducting a assemble of strong and effective sanctions on trader's field of activity (art. 11 to 13). Considering the objectives of the above mentioned Community Directive, it has been taken into consideration the meaning of the Italian discipline of reception, analyzing the evaluation system of wrong intentioned <b>commercial</b> <b>practice</b> and, in a particular way, the relationship between general clauses and black lists. So, our main question focused on the discipline of misleading <b>commercial</b> <b>practice,</b> in order to reach a conclusion with detailed analysis of each and single cases of <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> which are considered “in all circumstances unfair”, listed on the black list according the article 23...|$|R
