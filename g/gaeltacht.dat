25|$|Ontario sustains {{a network}} of Irish {{language}} enthusiasts, many of whom see the language {{as part of their}} ethnic heritage. Ontario is also home to <b>Gaeltacht</b> Bhuan Mheiriceá Thuaidh (the Permanent North American <b>Gaeltacht),</b> an area which hosts cultural activities for Irish speakers and learners and has been recognized by the Irish government.|$|E
25|$|In 1951 Fianna Fáil {{were back}} in power and Lynch was {{appointed}} Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, with special responsibility for <b>Gaeltacht</b> areas. The party was out of power again between 1954 and 1957. During this period Lynch served as Fianna Fáil spokesperson on the <b>Gaeltacht.</b> After the 1957 general election Fianna Fáil returned to power and de Valera headed his last government. Lynch, at 39, became the youngest member to join the government, as Minister for Education, as well as holding the <b>Gaeltacht</b> portfolio for a short while. Lynch introduced innovative legislation, such as raising the school leaving age; reducing school class sizes; removing a ban on married women working as teachers and allowing the Jewish skull cap to be worn but only {{from the age of}} 12.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the 20th century most {{habitual}} speakers of Irish still lived in the <b>Gaeltacht,</b> but the number of urban readers was growing. The genre was still dominated by a masculine sensibility, but in 1955 brother and sister Donncha Ó Céileachair and Síle Ní Chéileachair published Bullaí Mhártain, stories dealing with both the Munster <b>Gaeltacht</b> and city life. These stories were praised for their scope and their skilful adaptation of the language to an urban environment.|$|E
25|$|The Waterford <b>Gaeltacht</b> of An Rinn {{also has}} a {{distinct}} style, despite {{the small size of}} its population, which can be heard in the singing of Nioclás Tóibín.|$|E
25|$|The {{county has}} a {{commercial}} radio station, Radio Kerry, which commenced operations in 1990. RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta has {{a studio in}} Baile na nGall in the west Kerry <b>gaeltacht.</b>|$|E
25|$|The dwindling of Irish immigration, {{the decay}} of the <b>Gaeltacht</b> in Ireland and the passing of earlier generations were {{accompanied}} by a loss of the language. Interest is maintained among an activist minority.|$|E
25|$|The {{system of}} {{directional}} signs is based upon, {{and is very}} similar to, that employed in the United Kingdom, but is bilingual everywhere except in the <b>Gaeltacht,</b> where only the Irish language is used on signs.|$|E

(2012) , Report {{prepared}} by Ruth Carden for the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Northern Ireland, UK, National Parks & Wildlife Service, Department of Arts, Heritage and the <b>Gaeltacht,</b> Dublin, Ireland and the National Museum of Ireland – Education & Outreach Department.|$|E
25|$|The Donegal <b>Gaeltacht</b> {{brought forth}} Séamas Ó Grianna, who wrote prolifically and idiomatically {{about the people}} of his region, though much of his work has been criticised for its predictability. His brother Seosamh Mac Grianna, less prolific, left a handful of stories.|$|E
25|$|A survey {{carried out}} by the Department of Community, Rural and <b>Gaeltacht</b> Affairs showed that demand for an Irish-language radio station aimed at a younger {{audience}} than RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta was high. This means that RTÉ might have plans to launch such a radio station.|$|E
25|$|The use of Irish on the country's {{traffic signs}} {{is the most}} visible {{illustration}} of the state's policy regarding the official languages. It is a statutory requirement that placenames on signs be in both Irish and English except in the <b>Gaeltacht,</b> where signs are in Irish only.|$|E
25|$|In February 2008 it was {{announced}} that the Orange Order was to be granted nearly €250,000 from the Department of Community, Rural and <b>Gaeltacht</b> Affairs. The grant is intended to provide support for members in border areas and fund the repair of Orange halls, many of which have been subjected to vandalism.|$|E
25|$|Because Gweedore {{is in the}} <b>Gaeltacht</b> {{and partly}} due to the {{provisions}} of the Official Languages Act 2003, only the original Irish versions of placenames have any legal status, and these are used on road signage. However Anglicised versions were created for most placenames and are still in informal use in English.|$|E
25|$|Galway is {{considered}} the gateway to Connemara and the <b>Gaeltacht,</b> including Mám, An Teach Dóite, Cor na Móna, Ros Muc, Bearna and An Cheathrú Rua. The N59 along the western shore of Lough Corrib and the R337 along the northern shore of Galway Bay both lead to this largely rural and highly scenic region.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Second World War there were a large number of Irish working in Britain in the construction industry and as nurses. Many of them, both in provincial towns and in London, were Irish speakers from Conamara and other <b>Gaeltacht</b> areas, and Irish was commonly heard on building sites and in dance halls.|$|E
25|$|One of nine {{children}} of a small farming family, {{he was born in}} 1949 in Lispole, part of the Dingle <b>Gaeltacht</b> in County Kerry. He went to school in the Dingle Christian Brothers School, and after finishing he enrolled in the priesthood. As part of his training he was sent to a Catholic seminary school in Minnesota, United States in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} a number of {{newspapers}} printed in Irish. These include Foinse, a weekly newspaper and Lá Nua, a daily newspaper. Foinse mainly focuses on Irish language related matters and <b>Gaeltacht</b> affairs, but also contains many other areas including current affairs, national and international events and other features, including 'Foinse sa Rang' a segment aimed at helping Leaving Certificate students with their Irish exam. Lá Nua is printed in Belfast and focuses on current events and politics.|$|E
25|$|He {{was educated}} in Newry by Irish Christian Brothers at Abbey Christian Brothers Grammar School and at St Colman's College, Newry. In 1914 {{he joined the}} Irish Volunteers and the Gaelic League. He became {{secretary}} of the local branch in 1917, and joining Sinn Féin, founded a Sinn Féin club or cumann at Camlough, County Armagh, while working at the Co-Operative Flax-Scutching society. Aiken was committed to Gaelic speech which he learnt at the Donegal <b>Gaeltacht,</b> Ormeath Irish College.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the Luan Gallery, a multi-million euro {{contemporary}} art gallery {{opened in the}} town. The gallery is the first purpose-built, modern visual art gallery located in the Midlands. It was designed by Keith Williams, who also designed the Athlone Town Civic Centre. The gallery was opened by Jimmy Deenihan, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the <b>Gaeltacht.</b> The Luan opened with an exhibition from the Irish Museum of Modern Art, featuring the work of several national and international artists.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, {{the estate}} was renamed Páirc Ghnó Ghaoth Dobhair (Gweedore Business Park) and the <b>Gaeltacht</b> body, Údarás na Gaeltachta, started a {{campaign}} to try to entice businesses to Gweedore in hope of reviving the local economy. A Scottish company opened a call centre on the estate, but this subsequently closed. Other businesses include a number supermarkets, convenience stores, beauticians, hairdressers, contractors, garages, pharmacists, pubs, cafes, plenty of B and five well-established hotels: Derrybeg Hotel, Teach Jack and An Chúirt Hotel.|$|E
25|$|What {{turned out}} to be the final awards {{ceremony}} took place in Dublin on 11 November 1993. Presenting the awards on that occasion was Michael D. Higgins, then Minister for Arts, Culture and the <b>Gaeltacht.</b> No formal announcement was made by the sponsor subsequently as to the future of the Jacob's Awards so the reason why they were terminated remains a mystery. However, the death of public relations consultant and radio presenter, Frankie Byrne, shortly after the 1993 event may have been a factor.|$|E
25|$|Meath is the 14th-largest of Ireland’s 32 {{counties}} in area, and the ninth-largest {{in terms of}} population. It is the second-largest of Leinster’s 12 {{counties in}} size, and the third-largest in terms of population. The county town is Navan, where the county hall and government are located, although Trim, the former county town, has historical significance and remains a sitting place of the circuit court. County Meath also has the only two <b>Gaeltacht</b> areas {{in the province of}} Leinster, at Ráth Cairn and Baile Ghib.|$|E
25|$|Ó Domhnaill {{was raised}} in Kells, County Meath, Ireland and spent his summers in the Donegal <b>Gaeltacht</b> (Irish-speaking) area of Rann na Feirste, where the Irish {{language}} is the main spoken language. He inherited a deep love and understanding of Irish culture and Irish traditional music from his parents. In Donegal, Mícheál spent time with his aunt Neilí, a renowned singer who had a vast repertoire of Irish and English songs. He formed lifelong friendships with Pól and Ciarán Brennan (future members of Clannad) and Dáithí Sproule (future member of Skara Brae and Altan).|$|E
25|$|John Mary Lynch (15 August 1917 – 20 October 1999), {{known as}} Jack Lynch, was an Irish Fianna Fáil {{politician}} {{who served as}} Taoiseach from 1966 to 1973 and 1977 to 1979. He was Leader of Fianna Fáil from 1966 to 1979.

He was a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1948 to 1981.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominant}} {{spoken language}} of the district is Irish, but English can be widely heard as well. All schools, religious services, and advertisements are through Irish. Thousands of second-level and some third-level students from all over Ireland attend summer schools at Coláiste Cholmcille (Columba's College), Coláiste Bun an Inbhir, Coláiste Chú Chulainn, Coláiste Mhuire and Coláiste an Phiarsaigh in Gaoth Dobhair every summer to further their {{knowledge and understanding of}} the Irish language. This is a <b>Gaeltacht,</b> an where the Irish language is the first language, providing an unbroken link with millennia of Irish history and culture.|$|E
25|$|With {{the aid of}} Thomas MacDonagh, Pearse's {{younger brother}} Willie Pearse, their mother and both Margaret and Mary Brigid Pearse, along with other (often transient) academics, it soon proved a {{successful}} experiment. Pearse did all he planned, and even took students on field trips to the <b>Gaeltacht</b> in the West of Ireland. Pearse's restless idealism led him {{in search of an}} even more idyllic home for his school. He found it in the Hermitage, Rathfarnham, to which he moved St Enda's in 1910. Pearse was also involved in the foundation of St Ita's school for girls, a school with aims similar to those of St Enda's.|$|E
25|$|In <b>Gaeltacht</b> (Irish-speaking) areas {{it remains}} {{customary}} {{to use a}} name composed of the first name, followed by the father's name in the genitive case, followed {{by the name of}} the paternal grandfather, also in the genitive. Thus Seán Ó Cathasaigh (Seán O'Casey), son of Pól, son of Séamus, would be known to his neighbours as Seán Phóil Shéamuis. Occasionally, if the mother or grandmother was a well-known person locally, her name may be used instead of that of the father or grandfather. If the mother's name is used, then that of the maternal grandfather (or potentially grandmother) follows it, for example, Máire Sally Eoghain.|$|E
25|$|Máirtín Ó Cadhain, an {{idiosyncratic}} writer, {{was born}} in the Conamara <b>Gaeltacht,</b> a region rich in folklore but with no strong literary tradition. His early stories, written in a thorny and difficult style, though with psychological penetration, were set in his native region. He settled eventually in Dublin and his style became more direct, though still marked by imaginative intensity. He remains generally regarded as the doyen of the craft in Irish {{and one of the best}} writers to emerge from Ireland in the 20th century, despite the fact that the difficulty of his earlier style was criticised – a difficulty which may have robbed him of a wider readership.|$|E
25|$|She {{was born}} Kathleen Rita McNulty in Feymore, {{part of the}} small village of Creeslough in the <b>Gaeltacht</b> area (Irish-speaking region) of County Donegal, Ireland, on February 12, 1921, during the Irish War of Independence. On the night of her birth, her father, James McNulty, who was an Irish Republican Army {{training}} officer, was arrested and imprisoned in Derry Gaol for two years. On his release, the family emigrated to the United States in October 1924 and settled in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where James found work as a stonemason. At the time, Kathleen was unable to speak any English, only Irish; she would remember prayers in Irish {{for the rest of}} her life.|$|E
25|$|The Placenames Branch of the Department of Community, Equality and <b>Gaeltacht</b> Affairs {{gives the}} origin of the name Kilmashogue as meaning “Church of Saint Mochióg”. In the nineteenth century, the {{antiquarian}} Patrick Weston Joyce reported that he had found the remains of a small church, consisting of just a few walls, on the northern side of the mountain. Subsequent attempts to locate this site have been unsuccessful. In the chapel of nearby St Columba's college is an early Christian cross which was found on the mountain and is believed to have come from the church reported by Joyce. However, Coillte, the state-owned enterprise that manages the forestry on the mountain's slopes, suggest that the name Kilmashogue is a corruption of , which means “wood of the ash”, or , which means “wood of the lark”.|$|E
25|$|Gweedore has a {{rich history}} of theatre and drama productions. The local theatre Amharclann Ghaoth Dobhair was {{constructed}} in 1961. A local theatre group known as Aisteoirí Ghaoth Dobhair ('actors of Gweedore') was established in 1932. Their first production was called In Aimsir an Mháirtínigh, an original play by Eoghan Mac Giolla Bhríde which was staged in the parish hall in Derrybeg. Their plays and pantomimes, which were all staged in Irish, became a staple of <b>Gaeltacht</b> social life, drawing audiences from as far as Belfast and they performed throughout Ireland and Scotland. Members of the theatre group {{have gone on to}} create TV shows including CU Burn (Seán Mac Fhionnghaile), and have appeared on Ros na Rún (Gavin Ó Fearraigh). Many of Gweedore's musicians were associated with the group. Aisteoirí Ghaoth Dobhair are still active and performed shows at An Grianán Theatre in Letterkenny as part of the Earagail Arts Festival in 2010 and 2011.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, European Commission of Human Rights {{upheld the}} ban in case Purcell v. Ireland, though not unanimously. The Section 31 {{broadcasting}} ban lapsed on 19 January 1994 {{because it was}} not renewed by Minister for Arts, Culture & the <b>Gaeltacht</b> Michael D. Higgins, eight months prior to the August 1994 IRA ceasefire. The last person censored under the lapsing Order in January 1994 was Larry O'Toole, who was banned from appearing in a joint RTÉ/Channel Four programme on the Northern Ireland conflict, chaired by Channel Four's John Snow. The Channel Four production team wished to speak to O'Toole about his court victory. RTÉ would not allow this as O'Toole had been chosen as a candidate in European elections to be held five months later. RTÉ said O'Toole was therefore a Sinn Féin spokesperson, irrespective of the capacity in which he was to be interviewed or the proposed interview's distant relationship with a future election.|$|E
25|$|Mícheál Seosamh Ó Domhnaill {{was born}} 7 October 1951 in Kells, County Meath, Ireland.
