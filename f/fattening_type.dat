The experiment verified {{the quality of}} fat as the fat acid number. The experiment {{was performed on the}} final <b>fattening</b> <b>type</b> of chickens ROSS 308. Chickens were fed by 2 % lucerne meal in feed mixture. The carcass was sto red in a freezer box at - 18 °C after killing. Fat analysis was carried out after 12 and 15 months of storage. A cid number after 12 months storage was ranged from 5. 97 to 8. 39 mg KOH. g - 1 fat, after 15 months, was ranged from 3. 26 to 7. 80 mg KOH. g - 1 fat. The differences  between values ​​ of acid number and storage periods of chicken meat (12 and 15 months) was statistically significant (P ≤ 0. 05).

Leaves in Combination of Urea for <b>Fattening</b> Mossi <b>Type</b> and South Djallonke Sheep in Burkina. The study {{evaluated}} {{the potential of}} Piliostigma reticulatum pods (PrP) and Cajanus cajan leaves (CcL) for fattening sheep. The results indicate that both PrP and CcL provide adequate nutrition for growing lambs. However, when used to replace the cottonseed meal (CSM) on a same dry matter weight part basis, the substitution causes total nitrogen to decrease in the diet. These ingredients must be used in combination with adequate level of CSM and probably with a higher energy/nitrogen ratio. Benefit-cost analysis shows that diets involving less than 30 % of external inputs provide the highest benefits...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we carried the {{expression}} of leptin receptor in organs and abdominal fat of broiler chickens. The leptin receptor {{is a member of}} the class I cytokine receptor family, also known as the gpl 30 receptor family, although unlike many other family members, the leptin receptor does not form oligomers with gpl 30. Activation of leptin receptors directly or indirectly activates multiple signaling pathways that involve kinase-induced phosphorylation of proteins, including JAK 2 /STAT 3, erbB 2, ERK, IRS 1 and rho/rac. Signaling requires the presence of intact intracellular domains of the receptor. The leptin receptor is an external tyrosine kinase receptor; upon ligand binding each receptor can bind and activate the tyrosine kinase JAK 2, which then cross-phosphorylates tyrosine residues in the other receptor in the dimer. In {{this study we}} examined the expression of leptin receptor in organs and abdominal fat of broiler chickens. The aim of our experiment was to optimize the methodology for monitoring the expression of the leptin receptor in avian model. We studied the activity of leptin receptor in the liver, heart, spleen and abdominal fat in the final <b>fattening</b> <b>type</b> broiler chickens Ross 308. In heart tissue, spleen, liver at a relatively high concentration of total cDNA in the sample length leptin receptor fragment located in the expected quantities...|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} of several analytical methods proposed {{to predict the}} feeding system received by Iberian pigs during the fattening period has been contrasted. Samples of subcutaneous adipose tissue were analyzed from 38 batches of pigs fattened in three seasons of montanera (acorn and pastures feeding). They corresponded to the four categories described in the Quality Standard for Iberian pig products: 251 samples of bellota, 164 of recebo, 197 of cebo de campo and 137 of cebo. To perform the study, the following analytical methods were used: fatty acid quantification, NIR, alpha and gamma tocopherol, chemical sensor, triacilglycerides, stable isotopes and neophytadiene. The laboratories received the samples without any information about the fattening system to which they belonged and remitted their predictions {{with respect to the}} above categories. The results showed a high percentage of accurate predictions of the methods when the <b>fattening</b> <b>type</b> corresponds to the extreme categories (bellota and cebo), however, the methods had difficulty in discerning between samples from a mixed feeding regime with acorn and feed (recebo) and problems when pigs are fattened with compound feeds including vegetable fats with high levels of oleic acid. Although a simplification into only two categories (cebo/campo and recebo/bellota) results in a success rate higher than 90 % for some methods, the combination of two or three techniques with problematic samples allows for differentiating among the four categories with the same accuracy. Se ha contrastado la fiabilidad de varios métodos analíticos para determinar el tipo de alimentación recibida durante el cebo por cerdos Ibéricos a partir de muestras de tejido adiposo subcutáneo, procedentes de 38 partidas de cerdos de tres campañas de montanera. Las muestras correspondieron con las categorías de alimentación contempladas en la Norma de Calidad: 251 fueron de bellota, 164 de recebo, 197 de campo y 137 de cebo. Los métodos contrastados han sido ácidos grasos, NIR, alfa y gamma tocoferol, sensor químico, triacilglicéridos, isótopos estables y neofitadieno. Los distintos laboratorios recibieron las muestras sin información sobre el tipo de alimentación y remitieron sus predicciones respecto a las categorías previamente mencionadas. Los resultados obtenidos mostraron un elevado porcentaje de aciertos de los métodos cuando la alimentación se corresponde con las categorías extremas (bellota y cebo), sin embargo existía una dificultad en clasificar correctamente las muestras de cerdos de alimentación mixta con bellota y pienso (recebo) y confusión de algunos métodos cuando los cerdos son cebados con piensos que incluyen grasas vegetales con altos niveles de ácido oleico. Aunque la consideración de sólo dos categorías (cebo/campo y recebo/bellota) eleva el nivel de acierto por encima del 90 % en algunos métodos, la combinación de dos o tres técnicas para muestras problemáticas permitiría diferenciar las cuatro categorías con el mismo porcentaje de éxito...|$|E
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} assess the {{prevalence}} of locomotory system disorders within a wide cross-sectional study in 174 veal calves farms and to investigate risk factors associated to disorders with a relevant prevalence (> 1 %). A representative sample of the European veal production systems was considered in the three major producing countries (100 in NL, 50 in FR, 24 in IT). One batch/farm was observed in three stages of the fattening. At each visit calves with evidence of bursitis, hoof lesions, joint lesions, and lameness were recorded. A set of production system descriptors gathered by an interview to the farmer were considered as potential risks. Results showed an average prevalence ≤ 1 % of calves for hoof and joint lesions, and lameness at any stage. Bursitis was observed on 0. 2 %, 4. 1 % and 11. 2 % of calves at 3, 13 wks {{and at the end}} of fattening, respectively. Risk factors for bursitis were linked to concrete and wooden slatted floors, to space allowance ≤ 1. 8 m 2 /calf, and floors aged < 8 years while type of housing system (small vs. large groups) was not relevant. There was a significant interaction between stage of <b>fattening</b> and <b>type</b> of floor on bursitis. At the early stage, slatted and bedded floor were similar while at the end of the fattening the highest least mean was observed for calves on concrete floors. Bedding materials had a preventive effect. Rubber or straw should be largely adopted for veal calves as alternative solutions to hard floors in order to improve animals’ comfort, locomotory system health and welfare status...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to observe Holstein, Brown Swiss, Simmental and cross breed Anatolian Black genotypes fattened in feedlot {{regarding}} their ability to tolerate temperature and humidity and to compare Temperature Humidity Index types under climatic conditions of Şanlıurfa province in Turkey. Data obtained from a commercial farm composed of 70 594 test day records of 11 117 cattle (6 513 Holstein, 3 546 Brown Swiss, 838 Simmental and 220 Anatolian Black Crosses). Meteorological data were provided from nearest weather station located 9. 04 km away from feedlot area. THI values were calculated by using daily maximum, minimum and average air temperature and, humidity values according to three different combinations for each animal. Analysis were based on such a model that includes effects of year, sex, age, season, days on feed, beginning stage of <b>fattening</b> and several <b>types</b> of THI. Results showed that, Simmental and Anatolian Black genotypes were slightly more tolerant to heat stress compared to Holstein and Brown Swiss. In addition, Anatolian Black genotype was more sensitive to cold stress when compared to other genotypes. Different breakpoint values for stress and comfort zone intervals were obtained when different combinations of temperature and humidity variable (maximum or minimum) were used in THI formula...|$|R
40|$|With {{large sums}} of capital {{invested}} in fattening and breeding facilities, coupled with the uncertainty of pigmeat prices, the survey has confirmed that the modern pig farmer must maintain high levels of efficiency. The key factors to profitability are:- 1. Pigs produced per sow per year. This will depend both on the number raised per litter {{and the number of}} litters per sow per year. These are largely factors of management – ensuring sows are mated at the correct time, providing optimum farrowing facilities and keeping sow and piglet health at a high level. 2. Quantity of food for breeding stock. The amount of food will influence both the type and number of weaners. Analysis of the survey results shows that higher meal supplementation alone will increase the number of piglets per litter. The cost of this though may not be justified in itself and improved sow management may give a greater financial return. Individual sow feeders will decrease the use of meal by controlling sow intake to her requirement yet will not decrease efficiency. The decrease in meal cost can be quite significant and hence will reduce the direct cost of the weaner. 3. Efficiency of <b>fattening</b> stock. The <b>type</b> of weaner produced by the breeding herd has the largest bearing on the efficiency of food conversion and rate of growth in the fattening herd. Although the effect of housing and disease is not so great (except in the extremes) they can also increase the profitability of the unit quite substantially especially when the food cost is so high. 4. Cost of food. A comparison of extensive and intensive systems is outside the scope of this survey and indeed difficult at any time especially when one involves appreciating capital and the other depreciating capital. The farmer who has the lower cost structure and maintains stock performance can best cope with the unstable market. This does not mean that increased performance associated with a higher feed cost is not justified economically. Profits in pig production depend very much on efficiency levels. Farmers should keep records of stock performance and feed costs. They are simple to record and will at least provide some guide to assess efficiency...|$|R
