Thus it is not required that the branch provides services by itself. Merely it needs {{to have the ability}} to receive and use such. Even if the services are only provided for the head office the conditions are met. [...] Nevertheless, where the resources of the <b>fixed</b> <b>establishment</b> are only used for administrative support they will not be regarded as being used for the supply of goods or services.

The railway also opened coal and lead mines, <b>fixed</b> <b>establishments</b> press service, and open telegraph lines. It created tourist hotels in the mountains, most famously at Banff, Alberta and nearby Chateau Lake Louise, as well as landmark stations in major cities. The CPR built a fleet to enable fast passenger and freight service between Europe and Asia via Canada. Connections to American railways proved valuable.

5000|$|The item of Depreciation may, for {{the purpose}} of taking out the cost, simply be {{included}} in the category of the indirect expenses of the factory, and be distributed over the various enterprises {{in the same way as}} those expenses may be allocated; or it may be dealt with separately and more correctly in the manner already alluded to and hereafter to be fully described. The establishment expenses and interest on capital should not, however, in any case form part of the cost of production. There is no advantage in distributing these items over the various transactions or articles produced. They do not vary proportionately with the volume of business. … The establishment charges are, in the aggregate, more or less constant, while the manufacturing costs fluctuate with the cost of labour and the price of material. To distribute the charges over the articles manufactured would, therefore, have the effect of disproportionately reducing the cost of production with every increase, and the reverse with every diminution, of business. Such a result is greatly to be deprecated, as tending to neither economy of management nor to accuracy in estimating for contracts. The principles of a business can always judge what percentage of gross profit upon cost is necessary to cover <b>fixed</b> <b>establishment</b> charges and interest on capital.Diewert (2001) noticed that [...] "the aversion of accountants to include interest as a cost can be traced back to this quotation." ...|$|E

40|$|This master’s thesis {{will examine}} the concept of “fixed establishment” in VAT-law. The concept {{can be found in}} the new EC-directive on the common system of value added tax, however it has existed for thirty years in {{previous}} directives. Despite this, the legislator has never provided a proper definition of the concept. Its meaning has therefore evolved through the case-law of the ECJ. The Court has put forward a number of criteria which are all to be met if a <b>fixed</b> <b>establishment</b> is to be at hand. First of all the stablishment must have the human and technical resources necessary to provide the service. Furthermore the establishment need to be fully dependent on the parent company. This criterion may be fulfilled even though the establishment is a separate legal person. Finally the Court has held that the result of a transaction being taxed in the country where the <b>fixed</b> <b>establishment</b> is located must lead to a rational taxation result. This rational result is to be examined on a case-by-case basis. It seems clear that a scheme where a <b>fixed</b> <b>establishment</b> is being used with the sole purpose of avoiding VAT would not meet this requirement. The concept of <b>fixed</b> <b>establishment</b> is not to be confused with the concept of permanent establishment existing in income taxation. This latter concept is laid down by Article 5 of the OECD Convention. The two concepts share a common heart, however the ECJ has used the concept of <b>fixed</b> <b>establishment</b> to accommodate the needs of Community law in the field of VAT. Furthermore, this master’s thesis will examine what tax planning opportunities fixed establishments may provide. Swedish companies, primarily exempt taxable persons such as banks and insurance companies, may be tempted to establish fixed establishments in states with a low VAT-rate on professional services, i. e. services provided by consultants, engineers, lawyers and accountants etc. Exempt taxable persons are not entitled to deduct input VAT. By having the <b>fixed</b> <b>establishment</b> purchase the service in question abroad at a low rate of VAT and then forward the service to the main office, savings on VAT cost can be made. A VAT-saving scheme, based on reversed charge of VAT, may involve a Swedish company purchasing a service via a <b>fixed</b> <b>establishment</b> in Luxembourg at a VAT-rate of 15 %. When the establishment subsequently forwards the service to the main office in Sweden no taxation will be made since the ECJ has held that transactions within the same legal entity are not taxable. The difference in VAT cost is ten percentage points which is what the Swedish head office saves by having the <b>fixed</b> <b>establishment</b> purchase the service rather than purchasing it directly from the provider. Similarly, a <b>fixed</b> <b>establishment</b> may be organised in Switzerland, outside the Community, where the VAT-rate is even lower. There are obstacles to these kinds of VAT-saving schemes, and these will be more thoroughly examined...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} performance-related pay on wage differentials within firms. Our theoretical framework predicts that, compared to a fixed pay system, pay schemes based on individual effort increase within-firm wage inequality, while group-based bonuses have minor effects on wage dispersion. Theory also predicts an interaction between performance-related pay and union bargaining, where union power reduces the impact of performance pay on wage dispersion. The empirical contribution utilizes two recent Norwegian employer surveys, linked to {{a full set of}} employee records. A longitudinal sub-sample allows for identification based on <b>fixed</b> <b>establishment</b> effects. Introduction of performance-related pay is shown to raise residual wage inequality in nonunion firms, but not in firms with high union density. Our findings suggest that even though performance-related pay appears to be on the rise, the overall impact on wage dispersion is likely to be small, particularly in European countries with strong unions.

An important advantage of the use of establishment-level panel data is that it allows us to control for unobserved <b>establishment</b> <b>fixed</b> effects and industry-wide temporary shocks that are correlated with labor demand. In particular, when labor demand is high in general, both youth and elderly employment tend to increase. This may generate a spurious positive correlation between elderly employment and employment of other age ranges. Industry-level data would not allow us to control for industry-specific temporary shocks in labor demand. Another advantage compared to studies using individual-level data combined with age composition of workers in the local labor market is that establishment-level data are less likely to pick up changes in the demographic composition caused by fertility dynamics and migration.|$|R

Using a novel matched establishment-worker database from Brazil, I present evidence consistent with the existence of positive multinational spillovers through worker mobility in Brazil. The paper explores where spillovers occur and how they are absorbed. The main results suggest that the magnitude of wage spillovers from multinational establishments depends on the sector and worker under consid-eration. The results provide support for the hypothesis that higher-skilled former multinational-establishment workers are better able to convey information and higher-skilled incumbent domestic workers are better able to absorb information.

Since monospores from the red alga Porphyra yezoensis are a real example of migrating plant cells, the involvement of the cytoskeleton and PI 3 K was investigated during their early development. Our results indicate that the asymmetrical localization of F-actin at the leading edge is <b>fixed</b> by the <b>establishment</b> of the anterior-posterior axis in migrating monospores, which is PI 3 K-dependent and protein synthesis-independent. After migration, monospores adhere to the substratum and then become upright, developing into multicellular thalli via the establishment of the apical-basal axis.

Water authorities and <b>establishments</b> <b>fix</b> tariffs that users have to pay to obtain water. In fact, these tariffs should represent the total costs of providing good quality water in adequate quantities.

Domestic water is sold at a nominal daily flow where rates are lower for smaller towns and increase proportionally. In addition, not all subscribers are actually paying their dues and the water authorities are unable to control and limit illegal connections. As for irrigation practices, water is generally priced at a flat rate or at rates that are associated with the area that the users are allowed to invest in.

Rhizobia adopt themselves in different environment including soil, rhizosphere and grown within legume roots, where they <b>fix</b> nitrogen. The <b>establishment</b> of symbiosis is a very complicated process involving a coordinated exchange of signal between legume plants and the symbionts. The nodule development requires synthesis of signal molecules such as Nod factors that are important for induction of nodule development. There are different types of surface polysaccharides such as lipopolysaccharides, capsular polysaccharides, neutral and acidic polysaccharides found in rhizobia. The production of symbiotically active polysaccharides may allow rhizobial strains to adapt themselves to changing environmental conditions and interact efficiently with legume plants. Despite extensive research, the actual molecular function of the surface polysaccharides of rhizobia in symbiosis remains unclear. This review emphasized on the structural composition of extracellular polysaccharide of different rhizobia isolated from different legume plants. The compositions of extracellular polysaccharides are different in different rhizobia. The various compositions of extracellular polysaccharides produced by the symbionts are considered as the signaling molecules essential for determining host plant specificity. The present status of the biological functions of the exo-polysaccharide in symbiosis such as host specificity, successful invasion, formation of infection thread and induction of nodule formation in legume plants is also summarized here...|$|R

We document the following facts: a) There is a strong negative association between the fraction of women in the top layer of management and several establishment outcomes, among them business volume, investment, total wage bill per worker, total employment, and turnover; b) Establishments with a high fraction of women in the top layer of management are more likely to implement female-friendly policies, such as providing childcare facilities or promoting and mentoring female junior staff; c) The fraction of women in the top layer of management is also negatively associated with employment and wages, both male and female, full-time and part-time.

Our evidence is robust to a variety of controls, including <b>establishment</b> <b>fixed</b> effects. One natural explanation for this is that workers who quit leave behind firm-specific physical and organizational capital, thereby making replacement hiring less costly than {{the creation of a new}} position. To this end, we develop a matching model with on-the-job search and multi-worker firms that differentiates between the cost of creating a new position and the cost of adverting for an existing opening.
