5|$|Muskrats {{are covered}} with short, thick fur, which is medium to dark brown or black <b>in</b> <b>color,</b> with the belly a bit lighter (countershaded); as the age increases, it turns a partly gray <b>in</b> <b>color.</b> The fur has two layers, which helps {{protect them from the}} cold water. They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair, and to aid them in swimming, are {{slightly}} flattened vertically, which is a shape that is unique to them. When they walk on land, their tails drag on the ground, which makes their tracks easy to recognize.|$|E

5|$|The {{juvenile}} T.l. ludovicianus {{is similar}} in appearance, but the plumage is generally paler with a softer texture with buff-tipped wing coverts, a superciliary streak is less white, a fluffy vent and crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca) without bars. In August and September, the partial plumage molt for the post-juvenile wrens is darker <b>in</b> <b>color</b> and affects the contour plumage, wing coverts, tail and develops a whiter superciliary stripe. The post-nuptial molt for adults {{in the same time}} period is more pronounced <b>in</b> <b>color</b> than the spring molt, with both sexes similar in appearance.|$|E
5|$|The larger scutes {{display a}} pattern of black or yellow lines. The wood turtle's {{plastron}} (ventral shell) is yellowish <b>in</b> <b>color</b> and has dark patches. The posterior margin of the plastron terminates in a V-shaped notch. Although sometimes speckled with yellowish spots, the upper surface of the head is often a dark gray to solid black. The ventral surfaces of the neck, chin, and legs are orange to red with faint yellow stripes along the lower jaw of some individuals. Seasonal variation <b>in</b> <b>color</b> vibrancy {{have been known to}} occur.|$|E

5|$|The twigs of the {{red maple}} are reddish <b>in</b> <b>color</b> and {{somewhat}} shiny with small lenticels. Dwarf shoots are present on many branches. The buds are usually blunt and greenish to reddish <b>in</b> <b>color,</b> generally with several loose scales. The lateral buds are slightly stalked, and in addition there may be collateral buds present as well. The buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their reddish tint. The leaf scars on the twig are V-shaped and contain 3 bundle scars.|$|E

5|$|Akodon caenosus is the {{smallest}} of the Argentine members of the A.boliviensis group–indeed, among {{the smallest}} of all species of Akodon. The upperparts are uniformly colored, but their tone is variable: generally ochraceous brown, but approaching yellow, red, or olivaceous in some individuals. Reddish tones occur mostly in lactating females. High-altitude animals are generally lighter, but there is also conspicuous variation within populations. The ears are similar to the upperparts, but some individuals have the sides more rich and clear <b>in</b> <b>color.</b> The underparts are clearly different <b>in</b> <b>color,</b> varying from light gray to yellowish or reddish. There are yellowish rings around the eyes, which are more highly developed in high-altitude populations. There are white to yellowish hairs on the fore- and hindfeet. The tail is variably covered with hair and is dark brown above and white to buffy below.|$|E
5|$|Although known {{mostly for}} his work in black and white, Koppelman's painterly {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>color</b> took a new form in the 1970s, when he began using color in his prints. After 1980, he worked increasingly in pastel and watercolor.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is {{the most}} {{reflective}} of Uranus's moons. Its surface shows an opposition surge: the reflectivity decreases from 53% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 35% at an angle of about 1°. The Bond albedo of Ariel is about 23%—the highest among Uranian satellites. The surface of Ariel is generally neutral <b>in</b> <b>color.</b> There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the latter appears to be redder than the former by 2%. Ariel's surface generally does not demonstrate any correlation between albedo and geology {{on the one hand}} and color on the other hand. For instance, canyons have the same color as the cratered terrain. However, bright impact deposits around some fresh craters are slightly bluer <b>in</b> <b>color.</b> There are also some slightly blue spots, which do not correspond to any known surface features.|$|E

5|$|As a metal, {{titanium}} {{is recognized}} for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It {{is a strong}} metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white <b>in</b> <b>color.</b> The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650°C or 3,000°F) makes it useful as a refractory metal. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity.|$|E
