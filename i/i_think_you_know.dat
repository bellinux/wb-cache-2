2500|$|The {{death penalty}} was a notable issue during the 1988 presidential election. It {{came up in}} the October 13, 1988, debate between the two presidential nominees George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis, when Bernard Shaw, the {{moderator}} of the debate, asked Dukakis, [...] "Governor, if Kitty Dukakis [...] were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?" [...] Dukakis replied, [...] "No, I don't, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime." [...] Bush was elected, and many, including Dukakis himself, cite the statement as {{the beginning of the end}} of his campaign.|$|E
2500|$|On July 1, 1971, Felt was {{promoted}} by Hoover to Deputy Associate Director, assisting Associate Director Clyde Tolson. Hoover's right-hand man for decades, Tolson was in failing health {{and no longer}} able to attend to his duties. Richard Gid Powers wrote that Hoover installed Felt to rein in William C. Sullivan's domestic spying operations, as Sullivan had been engaged in secret unofficial work for the White House. In his memoir, Felt quoted Hoover as having said, [...] "I need someone who can control Sullivan. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> he has been getting out of hand." [...] In his book, The Bureau, Ronald Kessler said that Felt [...] "managed to please Hoover by being tactful with him and tough on agents." [...] Curt Gentry called Felt [...] "the director's latest fair-haired boy", but had [...] "no inherent power" [...] in his new post, the real number three being John P. Mohr.|$|E

2500|$|By Spring 2014, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} clear that Zhou's spheres of influence [...] the oil sector, Sichuan, the legal system, and his family members [...] were being methodically rounded up for investigation. However, {{in the absence of}} any official reports on Zhou himself, Chinese and international media became rife with speculation about his fate. At a press conference during the March 2014 national meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a reporter from Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post directly asked the spokesperson if he could provide more information on the rumours circulating about the Zhou Yongkang case. In response, the spokesman chuckled and said, [...] "like you, I've seen some stories on a select few media outlets," [...] he then recited a prepared party-line reply, then ended off his response with a smile, [...] "this is really all I can say in response to your question, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what I mean." [...] (...) Afterwards the assembled press gallery burst into laughter.|$|E

I am {{very glad}} you stay, for if I had not YOU for a protector, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> I must go, Lady Kicklebury. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{there are those}} who would forget my {{attachment}} to these darling children, my services to--to her--and dismiss the poor governess. But while you stay I can stay, dear Lady Kicklebury! With you to defend me from jealousy I need not QUITE be afraid.|$|E
6000|$|Lawson, {{entering}} {{with the}} code, cut him short in his shameless exculpation, and Curtis said, suavely: [...] "Mr. Winters, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> Mr. Lawson." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, O Satrap, Shabaka again. I won those pearls in a bet {{from the}} Great King, {{and with them}} a certain weight of gold. This <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> before, since your {{messenger}} of a while ago was whipped for trying to steal them, which under the rods {{he said he did}} by command, O Satrap." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One thing was," [...] said Mr. Wilmot, smiling, [...] "that a {{man must}} take himself in hand {{at some time}} in his life, and Dr. May only began to think himself {{responsible}} for himself when he lost his wife, who was wise for both.

6000|$|... "Uncle Dave is {{a little}} prejudiced, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>You</b> <b>know</b> all the over-harbor {{people who come to}} the Glen Church seem very nice. Oh, Gilbert, isn't this beautiful?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The next morning, while I dressed, {{the steward}} of {{my side of}} the ship came to me as usual to see what I wanted. But the first thing he said to, me was: [...] "Rather a bad job, sir--a {{passenger}} missing." [...] And while I took I scarce know what instant chill from it, [...] "A lady, sir," [...] he went on--"whom <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew.</b> Poor Miss Mavis, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen, man. She has a {{constant}} mind. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> your niece. As long as Blood lives, she will wait for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{you need}} not look like that," [...] he interrupted. [...] "It's {{perfectly}} true. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> it upon the steamer. I suppose that last day I made myself a nuisance to you, with my advice and fears, and {{all that sort of}} thing. Well, you see, now I ask no questions. I am content to take you as you are. You want some one to look after you, Virginia. Will you marry me?" ...|$|R

60|$|NORA. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{the sort}} of man you are at all. Whatever may be the matter with you, it's not want of feeling.|$|R
6000|$|... "Keener {{than you}} thought? Well, not long since I'd have {{admitted}} I {{was something of}} a fool. Anyhow, <b>I</b> rather <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> the Canadian cities." ...|$|R

6000|$|Grace laughed. [...] "You are delightfully naïve! I'm afraid you'll have {{to leave}} Mr. Askew alone, but I don't expect he'll do {{anything}} alarming. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> he {{is a friend of}} mine." ...|$|E
