5|$|Warner's {{next two}} years were less fruitful. The 1900 {{football}} team went 6–4–1, losing three games to the Big Four, and the 1901 season was a losing one, with Carlisle posting a 5–7–1 record. The following year, the team posted an improved 8–3 record, when Warner began implementing double (lateral) passes. Carlisle's quarterback Jimmy Johnson would make a lateral pass to the halfback running towards the sideline, bringing the defense with him as <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> the ball back to the fast-running Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Young helped Highland Park {{reach the}} Class 4A Region II {{basketball}} final in 1997 and the Class 4A Texas state basketball final in 1998. <b>He</b> <b>tossed</b> a no-hitter in 1997 while compiling a 6–0 record, helping Highland Park reach the Class 4A Texas state baseball final. During his senior year, he was District Most Valuable Player in basketball, and led his baseball {{team to the}} state championship, while pitching in two no-hitters. That year, he was a first-team All-State selection in basketball and baseball. After a high school career as an athlete and scholar, Young excelled in both baseball and basketball for Princeton University and became the Ivy League's first male two-sport Rookie of the Year.|$|E
5|$|During the Syracuse game, Kafka set {{a school}} record for {{consecutive}} completions in a game with 16, breaking the 47-year-old record set by Tom Myers in 1962. He set a new career-high in passingyards in a game by passing for 390yards, breaking his previous career-high in the season opener. Kafka also ran for a three-yard touchdown and threw three touchdown passes along with an interception. He caught a receiving touchdown when <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> a lateral to Andrew Brewer who threw it back to Kafka for a 24-yard touchdown. Kafka became the first Big Ten Conference player to score at least one passing, receiving and rushing touchdown in a game since Zack Mills from Penn State accomplished it on September 4, 2004, against Akron. Kafka finished the game with 35 completions on 42 attempts. However, despite his record-breaking performance, the Wildcats lost 37–34. He was named Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week on September 20 for his performance.|$|E

5|$|England were {{eventually}} out for 441 {{on the final}} day, leaving Australia a target of 98. Bradman’s men progressed quickly {{at the start of}} the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over by Bedser, including three boundaries, whereas Morris again lacked fluency. However, Barnes continued to score quickly, and 24 runs came from the first four overs. The tourists proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Morris fell for nine. Bradman came to the crease and fell for a duck after 12 minutes in the middle. This left Australia at 2/48; dark clouds began to close in on the ground, and rain appeared to be a possible saviour for England. However, it never came; Lindsay Hassett joined Barnes and they took the tourists to the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes gave Jack Young an opportunity for a return catch, but the ball was dropped. Barnes tied the scores with a swept boundary and ran off the field with a souvenir stump, believing the match was over. <b>He</b> <b>tossed</b> his souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and realising his mistake; Hassett proceeded to hit the winning run. Barnes ended unbeaten on 64 with 11 boundaries; he scored prolifically with his square cut. The next morning, he perused all of the newspapers, expecting to be heavily rebuked by analysts for reckless batting on the final day, but they instead focused on his captain's failure to score.|$|E
5|$|On March 7, 2015, Young {{signed with}} the Kansas City Royals. Young entered the season in the long {{reliever}} role with the Royals. He appeared in the Royals' sixth game on April 12 against the Los Angeles Angels with two scoreless innings as the Royals started the season 6–0. Young made his first start with the Royals on May 1. <b>He</b> <b>tossed</b> five no-hit innings against the Detroit Tigers. On June 16, Young posted 7 shutout innings and 3 runs batted in against the Milwaukee Brewers, becoming the first Royals pitcher to tally 3 RBI in a game since 1972. After achieving a record of 8–6 with a 3.25 ERA {{through the end of}} July, Young was returned to the bullpen on July 31 after posting a 5.11 ERA over a 5-game stretch. On September 27 (one day after his father died), Young made his first start since July 28 and pitched 5 no-hit innings against the Cleveland Indians. On October 20, Young started and pitched 4 2/3 innings in a game 4 victory in the 2015 American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays. It was Young's first postseason start since the 2006 National League Division Series. He earned the win in the October 27 game 1 of the 2015 World Series when he shut down the New York Mets, giving up a walk and no hits while striking out 4 over the final three innings, to help the Royals win 5–4 in 14 innings.|$|E

25|$|De Villiers has a {{reputation}} as an outstanding fielder, typified by a diving run-out of Simon Katich of Australia in 2006, when he dived to stop the ball, and while still lying on his stomach facing away from the stumps, <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> the ball backwards over his shoulder and effected a direct hit.

25|$|On March 15, Herrera’s platoon was {{advancing}} along {{a wooded}} road near the French town of Mertzwiller when it ran into two German machine-gun emplace-ments. Caught in a deadly crossfire {{between the two}} guns, the GIs dived for cover. Fearing that his comrades would be cut to pieces, Herrera stood up and ran toward the closest enemy position, firing his rifle from the hip. <b>He</b> <b>tossed</b> two grenades at the machine-gun nest; the concussion knocked the Germans down. Then he was on them, and all eight soldiers threw down their weapons and surrendered to him.|$|E
25|$|He was {{returned}} to Seattle on 25 March. He spent the season with the Double-A San Antonio Missions, setting a career-high with 122.0 innings pitched. He went 2–2 with a 3.16 ERA in 16 relief appearances and 4–5 with a 4.76 ERA in 17 starts. He allowed three or fewer runs in 12 of 17 starts. He won back-to-back starts 2 and 8 May. Rowland smith struck out a season-high seven batters in 6.0 innings on 24 May. He {{was placed on the}} disabled list with tendinitis in right knee from 21 to 28 July. <b>He</b> <b>tossed</b> 12.2 innings in relief without allowing an earned run from 14 August to 4 September.|$|E
25|$|In Super Bowl XXXVI, Warner {{threw for}} 365 yards (then the second-highest, now the third-highest total in Super Bowl history) and a passing {{touchdown}} {{along with a}} rushing touchdown, but his rhythm was disrupted by New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick's defensive game plan and <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> two costly interceptions which helped stake the heavy-underdog Patriots to a two-touchdown lead. After falling behind to the Patriots 17–3, though, the Rams rallied {{to tie the game}} late in the fourth quarter on a one-yard Warner quarterback sneak touchdown run and a 26-yard touchdown pass from Warner to Ricky Proehl. The game ended in a 20-17 loss for Warner and the Rams when Patriots kicker Adam Vinatieri kicked a game-winning field goal as time expired, giving the Patriots the first of three Super Bowl wins in four years.|$|E

500|$|Broderick's {{exploits}} were {{a mainstay}} of the New York newspapers. <b>He</b> <b>tossed</b> hoodlums who had been bothering women through a plate-glass window, one by one, and then arrested them for malicious destruction of property, {{for which they were}} sentenced to 30 days in jail. He also disarmed a man who was robbing a crowded restaurant at Columbus Circle with two guns and a knife. He once reputedly responded to a threat from gangster Legs Diamond by emptying a trash bin over his head, and forced him to crawl away. Other accounts of the confrontation hold that Broderick dumped Diamond in the trash bin head-first, while others say that Broderick knocked out Diamond with a single blow, with one account claiming that Diamond was left unconscious for 20 minutes. [...] Broderick's reputation for toughness was such that Jack Dempsey, the heavyweight boxing champion, once said of Broderick that [...] "He's the only I wouldn't want to meet in a fight outside the ring and its rules." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his newfound}} top {{prospect}} status Houtteman remained in Buffalo {{at the beginning}} of the 1947 season before being recalled to the Tigers in July. He was relegated to the bullpen for a time, and saw little action. But after Hal Newhouser, Fred Hutchinson and Dizzy Trout were used in two days, Tiger manager Steve O'Neill decided to start Houtteman against the Washington Senators for only the second start of his career. <b>He</b> <b>tossed</b> a five-hit shutout and Tiger general manager Billy Evans said, [...] "In 40years I've never seen a better pitching job by a first-year pitcher. We now know that Houtteman is really a big leaguer". He followed this with another five-hit victory against the Boston Red Sox, then pitched a three-hit shutout in September against the St. Louis Browns. He finished the season at 7–2 with a 3.42 ERA, seven complete games and two shutouts. His performance in 1947 caught the attention of New York Yankees star and future Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio, who said of Houtteman and Bob Lemon, [...] "They have more stuff and more pitching sense than any other young fellows I've seen come up in a long while".|$|E
500|$|Unseen by the Allies, Seydlitz {{assembled}} his cavalry {{into two}} lines, one of 20 squadrons {{and the second}} of 18, and reduced the speed of his approach {{until they reached the}} screening ridge of the Pölzen hill. There, they waited. Seydlitz sat {{at the head of the}} lines, calmly smoking his pipe. When the Allied cavalry came within striking distance, 1000 paces from the crest of the ridge, <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> his pipe in the air: this was the signal to charge. At 3:30 pm, Seydlitz crested the hill and his first 20 squadrons descended on the Allied army; [...] the leading Allied cuirassiers managed to deploy to meet Seydlitz's squadrons, but the momentum of the Prussian attack penetrated the Allied lines and wrought havoc among the disorganized mass. Prussian cavalry rode flank to flank; their training had taught them to form a line three and four deep from a column without breaking pace; once formed into a line, the troopers rode with knees touching, the horses' flanks touching, and horses riding tail to nose. Any attack of Prussian cavalry on open ground meant a line of horses—big Trakehners —bearing down on infantry or cavalry columns, lines, or squares. The horsemen could maneuver at a full gallop, to the left or right, or in an oblique.|$|E

500|$|The {{workload}} {{continued into}} July, when Hansen {{appeared in the}} first game of a July 2 doubleheader. He entered in the first inning in relief of starter Koslo, who allowed two runs without recording an out; none of the Giants' pitchers in the 11–5 defeat escaped unscathed, as all allowed at least two runs, topped by Hansen's five. His next two appearances came on July 4, as he pitched both games of a doubleheader against the Dodgers; <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> two innings in each contest, striking out two {{in the first game}} and walking one in the nightcap. On July 5, he gave up five runs in the seventh inning against Philadelphia, recording two outs and allowing five hits. In his next two outings against Boston and Pittsburgh, he allowed no runs, but the game against the Pirates would be his last scoreless outing with New York. Pitching against the Reds on July 16, Hansen allowed 3 runs in [...] innings; this was followed by four runs given up against the Cardinals on July 19. His final contest of the season came on July 25, when he pitched four innings against Cincinnati, allowing two runs before injuring his pitching elbow. Speaking with manager Leo Durocher, he claimed to feel a painless pop in his elbow as he threw a pitch; two hours later, the elbow had swollen [...] "as big as a football" [...] and visibly bruised, ending his season. Hansen ended the season with an 0–1 record, a 5.53 ERA, and 19 strikeouts; thereafter, he was selected by the Phillies in the Rule 5 draft.|$|E
