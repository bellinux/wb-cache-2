5|$|For the National Register of Historic Places nomination, {{only the}} {{interior}} {{of one of the}} four units was surveyed, the second floor interior of 341 Broadway. This unit is accessed from a spiral staircase leading from the first floor to the attic. The second floor landing has a short foyer before opening to two parlors. The front parlor is said to have had a water fountain which was removed, but the plumbing is said to exist within the floor. The back parlor has a Queen Anne mantel and leads to the dining room with large floor-to-ceiling china closets. Located {{on the east side of}} the apartment is the kitchen, pantry and rear staircase. The north part of the apartment contains two bedrooms and a bath. The NRHP nomination states that the alterations to the unit were minimal and it is likely that the same would have been done for the first <b>floor</b> <b>unit.</b> The northern Fuller House, containing 343-345 Broadway, has been more seriously modified because it has been split into four units. In 2013, real estate information for 343 Broadway suggests the expanse of the modifications to the house by listing the property as having 20 rooms, with 8 bedrooms and 5 baths. According to Trulia the house was sold in 2010 for $140,000 and still in the four unit configuration. A three-bay stuccoed garage dating from the 1920s or 1930 is used by 339-341 Broadway.|$|E

2500|$|The Caloris floor plains {{material}} {{is a special}} problem and {{is not included in}} the Caloris Group. The plains have some features in common with the Maunder Formation in the floor of Orientale on the Moon but do not show the radial and circumferential ridges characteristic of the Maunder that led to its interpretation as a basin <b>floor</b> <b>unit.</b> The Caloris floor plains have a more open, coarser fracture pattern than does the Maunder. In addition, the Caloris ridges and the fractures cutting them have a crude rhombic pattern that led Strom and others to conclude that the plains materials subsided and then were gently uplifted to produce the open tension fractures observed. The ridges in the floor of Caloris lack the crenulated crests that are common on lunar ridges. Regardless of the origin and tectonic history of these plains, it seems clear that they represent a deep basin fill that obscures the original floor of the Caloris Basin.|$|E

40|$|URL] Paper ID: 12 - 01 - 0042 A three dimensional, {{approximately}} half scale experimental test {{has been carried}} out to investigate the effect of precast-prestressed <b>floor</b> <b>units</b> on the seismic performance of reinforced concrete moment resisting frames. This paper gives an overview of the experiment and summarizes the results obtained from the test. The paper focuses on the level of strength enhancement and elongation within the plastic hinges. The results show that the presence of prestressed <b>floor</b> <b>units</b> partially restrains elongation of plastic hinges such that elongation in the exterior and interior plastic hinges differs significantly. This increases the strength of the beams more than that specified in the major structural design codes. This is a cause of great concern as this underestimation of beam strength may result in brittle column failure modes in a major earthquake...|$|R
40|$|The 2006 {{version of}} the New Zealand Concrete Standard NZS 3101 has {{introduced}} two new details for connection of precast and prestressed hollowcore <b>floor</b> <b>units</b> to supporting reinforced concrete beams. Although these amended connection details have been experimentally proved to yield better seismic performance of the building, concerns about their performance in fire still remain. A simplified and novel approach to model the two way action of hollowcore floor slabs with topping is established. This paper analytically investigates the fire performance of the precast and prestressed hollowcore <b>floor</b> <b>units</b> connected to the supporting moment resisting reinforced concrete building frames according to the old practice and the improved details recommended in NZS 3101 using the finite element tool SAFIR. The simulation results show that rigid connections between the hollowcore floor systems and perimeter beams provide better fire resistance than rotationally flexible connections...|$|R

40|$|Paper No. 37 A three {{dimensional}} {{approximately half}} scale experimental subassemblage {{is currently being}} tested at the University of Canterbury to investigate the effect of precast-prestressed <b>floor</b> <b>units,</b> which do not span past the internal columns, on the seismic performance of reinforced concrete moment resisting frames.

The preliminary results have shown that elongation between the external and internal plastic hinges varies by more than two fold. With {{the addition of the}} prestressed <b>floor</b> <b>units,</b> the strength of the moment resisting frame used in the test was found to be 25 % higher than the current code specified value. In other situations, particularly where there are more than 2 bays in a moment resisting frame, greater strength enhancement may be expected.

Subjects: A total of 10, 353 patient records from the National Pediatric Trauma registry, representing all pediatric trauma patients treated at affiliated hospitals from April 1994 through December 1996. Records with incomplete information were eliminated from the study, leaving 8, 081 usable patient records. Measurements: A total of 14 variables are selected from the 81 values present in the National Pediatric Trauma Registry as independent variables for the artificial neural networks.
