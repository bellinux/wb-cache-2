5|$|The Komnenian {{period was}} {{followed}} by the dynasty of the Angeloi, who oversaw perhaps the most crucial period in the Decline of the Byzantine Empire. The next quarter of a century would see Constantinople fall to an invading force {{for the first time in}} its history, and the final loss of the empire's 'great power' status. However, with the death of Andronikos, the Komnenian dynasty, having lasted 104 years, had <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> an end.|$|E
5|$|Due to an overcommitment of {{resources}} {{early in the}} war, the Australian economy suffered badly from manpower shortages as early as 1942. As a result, the government began the demobilisation process before the war was even over, and when it had <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> an end, the government was necessarily very keen for the demobilisation process to be completed as quickly as possible. Understandably, defence issues were not given a high priority as people tried to rebuild their lives {{after the war and}} as such it was not until 1948 that the Citizen Military Forces (CMF) was reformed.|$|E

25|$|In {{the history}} of French music, Les Troyens stands out as a grand opera that avoided the shallow glamour of Meyerbeer and Halévy, but {{therefore}} paid the price of long neglect.

25|$|At Nahavand, the Umayyads {{attempted}} to make their last stand in Khorosan. Umayyad forces fleeing Hamedan and the remainder of Ibn Sayyar's men joined with those already garrisoned.

The Umayyad military units from Syria within the garrison cut a deal with the Abbasids, saving their own lives by selling out the Umayyad units from Khorosan who were all put to death.

25|$|After a few {{generations of}} {{existing}} within the Roman systems, the Jewish desire for independence did <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a head and resulted in the Bar Kobha revolt in 132-135 CE.

With its destruction, Jews resorted to the traditional explanation that they had transgressed and were being punished for their sins. The religious reaction to the destruction was evident through changes in halakhah (Jewish Law), midrashim, and 2 Baruch, all of which mention the agony of the temple’s destruction.|$|E

25|$|On 30 December 1557, Henry II wrote {{a letter}} to Suleiman, asking him for money, saltpeter, and 150 galleys to be {{stationed}} in the West. Through the services of his ambassador Jean Cavenac de la Vigne, Henry II obtained the dispatch of an Ottoman fleet to Italy in 1558, with little effect however apart from the sack of Sorrento. The Ottomans also contributed by the Ottoman invasion of the Balearic islands in 1558. The conflict would <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> an end with the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis (1559) and the accidental death of Henry II that same year. The newfound peace between the European powers however created long-lasting disillusionment on the Ottoman side.|$|E
25|$|A {{victory in}} their FA Cup fifth-round replay sent Middlesbrough {{into the home}} match with Liverpool with {{optimism}} that their disastrous run of form in the league would <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> an end, and their hopes came true. Liverpool were riding high in second place, while Boro began the day in second bottom. A stroke of luck put the home side ahead as Xabi Alonso diverted the ball into his own net from a corner. Tuncay doubled the advantage in the second half, and they could have had more as the visitors left themselves open at the back {{as they tried to}} find a way back. Brad Jones kept a fourth consecutive home clean sheet and Boro moved out of the relegation zone with their 2–0 win, while Liverpool had now failed to win at the Riverside for seven seasons.|$|E

Fox had moved its affiliation to full-power KFTA-TV (channel 24), formerly a satellite of NBC affiliate KNWA-TV (channel 51). None {{of the three}} stations that were available (the two KPBI's and UPN affiliate KFDF-CA (channel 10)) joined The CW; they were all owned by Equity Broadcasting, which shunned The CW {{in every one of}} its markets (KFDF-CA joined the Equity-owned Retro Television Network instead). The CW would <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the market the following year on a cable-only channel available via Cox Communications (and eventually on digital subchannels of the market's ABC affiliate, KHBS/KHOG-TV, channels 40 and 29). Equity would eventually declare bankruptcy in 2009 due to a number of factors involving the digital transition and problems with RTV which led it to losing control of that network to Luken Communications.|$|E

25|$|The reconstituted Master Blasters {{continued}} their undefeated streak in October. Meanwhile, Nash {{would have his}} first singles match on September 28 by defeating Tom Zenk. At Halloween Havoc on October 27, 1990, the Blasters upended The Southern Boys and began {{to move up the}} WCW tag team ratings. However, their winning streak would <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> an end on November 22, when Tom Zenk and Brian Pillman handed them their first defeat with Pillman pinning Blade. They rebounded to go on another undefeated streak by defeating The Southern Boys as well as Alan Iron Eagle and Tim Horner, and earning a NWA United States Tag Team Championship title shot against then champions The Steiner Brothers, but were defeated in two occasions. They were squashed on television in 52 seconds by the Steiners in a match that aired on Worldwide on February 2, 1991. Following this loss, their momentum began to dissipate as the Blasters would suffer follow-up losses to The Southern Boys and Ricky Morton and Tommy Rich. The tag team disbanded {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E
25|$|UNAMSIL was {{eventually}} formed and deployed in 1999, authorised under a Chapter VII mandate, {{it was meant}} to enforce the Lome agreements. However, violence would continue. From the outset the RUF was beyond uncooperative and once the ECOMOG contingent withdrew, the RUF attacked UN forces, eventually taking hundreds hostage. This led to an unexpected backlash from the international community that the RUF did not anticipate. Its leadership had expected the international community to cut and run, as it had done in Somalia and earlier when UNOMSIL fled Freetown. Instead, with British support, an aggressive campaign was waged against the RUF. UNAMSIL's mandate was expanded and its manpower enlarged. By late 2000 and early 2001 the RUF's military strength had been severely depleted. Thus the Abuja agreements were signed and UNAMSIL fulfilled its mandate in December 2005. While Sierra Leone is at peace today and the UN's mission can be deemed a success, {{the way in which the}} situation developed illustrates Shearer's point: that a consent-based approach focused on negotiation that encompasses all belligerents' interest may not necessarily lead to success. As we see, fighting continued despite the presence of UNOMSIL. Indeed, even after UNOMSIL was replaced by a more robust force under a Chapter VII mandate in the form of UNAMSIL the violence continued. It was not until the British intervened militarily and substantially degraded the RUF's capability to sustain the conflict, as Executive Outcomes had done years prior, did the RUF <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the negotiating table and allow for the establishment of peace.|$|E

Jack McCain's tour as CINCPAC ended in September 1972, despite his desire to have it extended {{so he could see}} the war to its conclusion. The old-time POWs cheered even more during the intense [...] "Christmas Bombing" [...] campaign of December 1972, when Hanoi was subjected {{for the first time to}} repeated B-52 Stratofortress raids.

500|$|A {{prolonged}} drought {{coincided with}} and eased {{work on the}} lake's construction. The valves on the Scrivener Dam were closed on 20 September 1963 by Minister for the Interior, Gordon Freeth; Menzies was absent due to ill health. Several months on, with no rain in sight, mosquito-infested pools of water were the only visible sign of the lake filling. With the eventual breaking of the drought, the lake reached the planned level on 29 April 1964. On 17 October 1964, Menzies (by now Sir Robert) commemorated the filling {{of the lake and}} the completion of stage one with an opening ceremony amid the backdrop of sailing craft. The ceremony was accompanied by fireworks display, and Griffin's lake had <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fruition after five decades, at the cost of AUD5,039,050. Freeth suggested that Menzies had [...] "been in a material sense the father of the lake" [...] and that the lake should be named after him.

In response to the report, the Republican chair of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Representative Jeff Miller, said, [...] "It appears the White House has <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> terms with the serious and systemic VA health care problems we've been investigating and documenting for years" [...] and that he would work with the White House to fix the problems.

500|$|Digital Spy writer Catriona Wightman {{found the}} episode [...] "completely absurd" [...] but [...] "brillantly entertaining."

After 100 episodes, the show understood that it needed to go big to top off the royal wedding storyline. So the wedding, and attendant quest to stop it, was as big, dramatic and heartfelt as Gossip Girl at its best." [...] Glennon also conceded about the Gossip Girl reveal, the show can still pull out those OMG moments. Glennon found Georgina [...] "amazing" [...] in the episode, [...] "you can't even take your eyes off her because she's so great in every scene." [...] However, The Atlantic Wire thought the writers [...] "should have waited until the last-ever episode to do the unveiling" [...] of Gossip Girl and questioned, [...] "isn't that indicative of the show's greater failings over these past four and a half years? That constant need of this once-promising show to tip its hand too soon?" [...] and concluded [...] "we think the time has <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> remove Gossip Girl from our bookmarks." ...|$|E
