25|$|The 2005–06 season {{opened with}} {{high hopes for}} the Magic despite {{not being able to}} add first round draft pick Vasquez. Grant Hill was {{supposedly}} finally healed from his multiple ankle surgeries. Dwight Howard and Jameer Nelson showed excellent progress during summer-league play. Second round draft pick Travis Diener showed excellent shooting and decision making during the summer. And the free agent signing of Keyon Dooling showed that the club was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> making progress. Then trouble began. Hill, despite his ankle apparently being healed, suffered a painful sports hernia injury that would hamper his play throughout the entire season. After playing in three preseason games, he underwent surgery to correct the hernia and would not appear during the regular season until mid-December, to which he lasted a month before attempting to make another comeback in February and early March, however he only played sporadically. Then a foot injury to Nelson forced him to sit out over a month.|$|E

Rayo de Jalisco and his team won both {{the second and third}} fall to win the entire match. In the main event the challenger La Sombra and the champion Dragón Rojo, Jr. quickly split the first two falls between them, tied up at 1–1.
