25|$|The broad {{availability}} of low-cost Internet connections {{starting in the}} mid-1990s lessened the need for FidoNet's store-and-forward system, as any system <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> be reached for equal cost. Direct dialing into local BBS systems rapidly declined. The {{availability of}} internet connectivity {{is by no means}} universal, and although FidoNet has shrunk considerably since the early 1990s, it remains in use around the world.|$|E
25|$|After having {{for a time}} {{endorsed}} Theodor Herzl, including {{presiding over}} {{a meeting at the}} Maccabean Club, London, addressed by Herzl on 24 November 1895, and endorsing the main Palestine-oriented Zionist movement, Zangwill quit the established philosophy and founded his own organisation, named the Jewish Territorialist Organization in 1905. Its goal was to create a Jewish homeland in whatever possible territory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> be found for them, with speculations including Canada, Australia, Mesopotamia, Uganda and Cyrenaica.|$|E

25|$|In 1881, {{he took a}} job as {{a teacher}} in Oconto, Wisconsin. There, he {{continued}} to read voraciously, and had a particular attraction for science. It was here that he started to develop a passion for helping people understand science.

25|$|The {{median income}} for a {{household}} {{in the city}} was $32,285, and the median income for a family was $37,767. Males had a median income of $31,236 versus $25,183 for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,838. About 17.2% of families and 20.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 30.1% of those under age 18, and 15.4% of those age 65 or over. In 2011, the U.S. Census Bureau ranked the Memphis area as the poorest large metro area in the country. Dr. Jeff Wallace of the University of Memphis noted that the problem was related to decades of segregation in government and schools. He {{said that it was}} a low-cost job market, but other places <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> offer cheaper labor, and the workforce was undereducated for today's challenges.|$|E
25|$|Ben Land snr., private trainer to Lord Poulett at Droxford, {{had decided}} to retire in 1870, and Chris Green was persuaded {{to take his place}} in Hampshire in September 1870 where he took charge of such horses as Benazet, Cortolvin and The Lamb. He was given the task of {{preparing}} The Lamb, a little iron grey Irish horse, for a second Grand National win and during the winter 'Lord Poulett and his party were exceedingly sanguine of success, and his Lordship caused a private circular to be distributed among his friends telling them to back The Lamb to win'. For the race itself, The Lamb, unseen in public for exactly two years, was paraded by Ben Land jun. and 'was greeted with a buzz of admiration, aroused by his beautiful appearance and condition... No horse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> have looked better than The Lamb did'. This testament to Green's work continued in the race as The Lamb kept ahead of the pursuing horses to finally win by a couple of lengths in 'a desperately exciting finish'.|$|E

Although he liked Immortal, Wagner dubbed Euronymous a [...] "nutcase" [...] and considered Burzum [...] "shit". He also criticized black metal's purposely lo-fi recording aesthetic; Lamounier said that Burzum's guitar timbre [...] "sounded like it was recorded through a transistor radio".|$|E

500|$|Although Henry {{played up}} front as a striker during his youth, {{he spent his}} time at Monaco and Juventus playing on the wing. When Henry joined Arsenal in 1999, Wenger {{immediately}} changed this, switching Henry to his childhood position, often pairing him with Dutch veteran Dennis Bergkamp. During the 2004–05 season, Wenger switched Arsenal's formation to 4–5–1. This change forced Henry to adapt again {{to fit into the}} Arsenal team, and he played many games as a lone striker. Still, Henry remained Arsenal's main offensive threat, on many occasions conjuring spectacular goals. Wenger said of his fellow Frenchman: [...] "Thierry Henry could take the ball {{in the middle of the}} park and score a goal that no one else <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> score".|$|E

500|$|Aristotle's {{biology is}} {{constructed}} {{on the basis}} of his theory of form, which is derived from Plato's theory of Forms, but significantly different from it. Plato's Forms were eternal and fixed, being [...] "blueprints in the mind of God". Real things <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could,</b> in Plato's view, at best be approximations to these perfect Forms. Aristotle heard Plato's view and developed it into a set of three biological concepts. He uses the same Greek word, [...] (eidos), to mean first of all the set of visible features that uniquely characterised a kind of animal. Aristotle used the word γένος (génos) to mean a kind. For example, the kind of animal called a bird has feathers, a beak, wings, a hard-shelled egg, and warm blood.|$|E
500|$|In 1886 Les deux pigeons {{was finally}} {{produced}} at the Paris Opéra {{and was a}} great success. [...] It was Messager's last success for four years. [...] His attempt at a more serious opera, Le bourgeois de Calais (1888), with [...] "a boring historical plot, bad lyrics, and a banal score" [...] was not well received. One critic wrote, [...] "That Le Bourgeois de Calais will have a successful career {{there is not the}} faintest chance, for all the patriotic bolstering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> not make it an attractive piece." [...] Messager followed this with a musical fairy tale Isoline (1888), which was slightly better received, and a three-act operetta, Le mari de la reine (The Queen's Husband, 1889), which failed, although Messager thought it [...] "the best of my flops." [...] Also in the 1880s, Messager published some song cycles, and [...] "sung waltzes".|$|E

"'Till the World Ends' {{was already}} the best Britney single since 'Toxic', an ecstatic Euroclub floor-filler {{about wanting to}} dance until the world ends and other {{important}} matters.

(Fact: In 2011, pretty much any song <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> be made infinitely better by the addition of a Nicki Minaj verse.) Sprinkle a little bit of Ke$ha, the song's co-writer, on the chorus, and you've got a three-headed diva Hydra that sums up the recent changing of the femme pop guard from airbrushed and perfect to (relatively) weird and chaotic. It's the year's greatest quickie cash-in remix created to boost the chart position of a floundering single. Considering the ubiquity of the practice, that's saying something." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} years of her career, McLeod's playing style was {{described}} as exuberant and with [...] "boisterous" [...] energy. Her kinetic style of goalkeeping was something that came naturally to her in her youth. Tim Rosenfeld, now a coach at the University of Wisconsin, first saw McLeod in the early 2000s while he was coaching at Penn State University and noted that she was [...] "out of control" [...] and kept coming off her line [...] "going for balls she had no business going for." [...] When she eventually transferred to Penn State in 2004, Rosenfeld stated that [...] "she'd make saves that no one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> make, but she'd also made decisions that allowed a bad goal." [...] As a youth player in 2002, the FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship Technical Study Group noted that she was [...] "self-assured in all situations," [...] has [...] "good positioning" [...] and [...] "organized defense well." ...|$|E

Commenting on his move back to Richmond Park, he said [...] "Both the fans and the club have always been great to me, and the stability of the club behind the scenes really made me want to come back and play my football in Inchicore again." [...] He made his third debut for the club in a 2–1 victory over Dundalk on 17 February 2014 in a Leinster Senior Cup match, scoring a free kick. On 2 March 2014, Fahey scored the only goal as St. Patrick's Athletic became the first team to win the FAI President's Cup, defeating Sligo Rovers in the process. His goal drew praise from Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill and from Sligo Rovers' Alan Keane, who stated [...] "A wonder goal won it, it was a great strike. No keeper <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> have saved that." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Romm {{stated that}} [...] "Feeding some 9 billion people by mid-century {{in the face}} of a rapidly {{worsening}} climate may well be the greatest challenge the human race has ever faced." [...] Romm's 2010 book, Straight Up notes: [...] "the bottom line is that the economic cost of action is low, whereas the cost of inaction is incalculably greater". [...] Romm calculates that deployment of existing technologies on the massive scale that can save the climate can be accomplished at the cost of 0.12 percent of global GDP per year. He also asks in the book, [...] "will the United States be a global leader in creating jobs and exports in clean energy technologies, or will we be importing them from Europe, Japan, and the likely clean energy leader in our absence, China." [...] In 2005, with respect to the U.S. Congress's actions on climate, including its votes on the XL Pipeline, Romm told The Guardian: [...] "Future generations suffering from the consequences of our inaction will be bewildered that the legislative body of the richest country <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> devote so little effort to ameliorating the climate problem and so much effort to making it worse." ...|$|E

500|$|The creators {{wanted to}} make Kim as {{believable}} as possible. Schooley's and McCorkle's own daughters inspired them to conceive Kim as a [...] "character with dimension ... that girls could watch and appreciate." [...] McCorkle was quick in deciding very early on that Kim {{does not belong to}} a spy organization, nor does she possess any superpowers. Although admitting that the character's accomplishments are generally [...] "implausible," [...] Schooley and McCorkle wanted Kim to remain relatable to young viewers, and avoided making her [...] "impervious" [...] like superheroes by giving her [...] "real problems and teen issues." [...] McCorkle described Kim as [...] "incredibly competent in the action world but challenged in the real world by all the things we all have trouble with", including embarrassment, school work and family. Schooley explained that [...] "What makes Kim effective in the action world is gymnastics, cheerleading, physical activity, something that any kid, any girl, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> do." [...] Additionally, the character is skilled in 17 different types of kung fu. At one point an indestructible supersuit complete with special abilities was created for Kim, but the outfit was ultimately abandoned to avoid contradicting with the character's [...] "she can do anything" [...] motto. Elaborating on her role in the pilot, Schooley believes that [...] "Kim's mix of tenacity, intelligence and heart makes for a very strong female role model for kids," [...] however, [...] "Sure she can save the world, but that doesn't help her a bit when she comes face-to-face with her latest school crush." [...] Furthermore, the writers envisioned the character having her own website and hand-held communicator – named the [...] "Kimmunicator" [...] after the character – with video chat, both of which were considered revolutionary back in 2000, a time when few young people owned cellphones. Kim's use of advanced technology represents her ability to [...] "effortlessly hop around the world and get back in time for dinner. Which is pretty unrealistic, but it’s what kids can do on the internet now. They can talk to somebody anywhere".|$|E
2500|$|Already in the XVII c. {{image of}} Vilnius {{as a city}} of many {{religions}} was very noticeable. In 1600, Samuel Lewkenor’s book describing cities with universities was published in London. He mentioned that citizens of Vilnius were Catholics, Orthodox, followers of John Calvin and Martin Luther, Jews and Tartar Muslims. Vilnius {{had a reputation as}} a city which had no rivals in Europe in the number of churches of different confessions throughout the entire 17th century. At the end of the century, this image was promoted by the highly rated and several times republished work by Robert Morden [...] "Geography Rectified or a Description of the World" [...] which ran that no other city <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> surpass Vilnius in the number of churches and temples of various confessions except perhaps Amsterdam.|$|E

Stewart was reluctant at first, but Clark convinced her to take the case, arguing that otherwise [...] "the Arab world would feel betrayed by their friends on the American left." [...] Interviewed by the Washington Post about her embrace of Rahman's case, she said, [...] "my own political sense tells me that the only hope for change in Egypt is the fundamentalist movement." [...] Kuby, who had represented Rahman earlier, disagreed with Stewart's characterization, stating, [...] "I love Lynne, but no one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> fairly posit the sheikh as a progressive or liberal on any issue."
