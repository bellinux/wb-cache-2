I regard this tax to be the most iniquitous of all <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> man's standpoint. As the sovereignty and self-rule movement is essentially for the poorest in the land, the beginning will be made with this evil.|$|E
5|$|Romualdo Braschi-Onesti, cardinal-nephew of Pius VI (1775–1799), was the {{penultimate}} cardinal-nephew. Despite Pius VI's lineage to a noble Cesena family, {{his only}} sister {{had married a}} man <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> Onesti family. Therefore, he commissioned a genealogist to discover (and inflate) some trace of nobility in the Onesti lineage, an endeavor which yielded only a circuitous connection to Saint Romualdo.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi {{government}} quickly {{negotiated a}} deal in which the Swiss burned the Bf 110under the supervision of German observers {{in return for a}} sale to the Swiss of 12new Bf 109G-6 Gustav to replace combat losses. The new fighters were delivered in batches of six on 20and 22May. The new planes had serious manufacturing defects <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> workmanship and production disruptions caused by Allied bombings, and after complaints the Germans refunded half of the six million Swiss franc purchase price.|$|E

5|$|Although the Poor Law Amendment Act did not ban {{all forms}} of outdoor relief, it stated that no able-bodied person was to receive money or other help <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Poor</b> Law {{authorities}} except in a workhouse. Conditions in workhouses were to be made harsh to discourage people from claiming. Workhouses were {{to be built in}} every parish and, if parishes were too small, parishes could group together to form Workhouse Unions. The Poor Law Commissioners were to be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Act.|$|E
5|$|At the hearing, new {{evidence}} was heard, that heavy rain {{had fallen on}} the ship {{on the second day}} of the killings, but a third batch of slaves was killed after that. This led Mansfield to order another trial, because the rainfall meant that the killing of those slaves, after the water shortage had been eased, could not be justified in terms of the greater necessity of saving the ship and the rest of its human cargo. One of the justices in attendance also said that this evidence invalidated the findings of the jury in the first trial, as the jury had heard testimony that the water shortage resulted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> condition of the ship, brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions, rather than from errors committed by its captain. Mansfield concluded that the insurers were not liable for losses resulting from errors committed by Zong crew.|$|E
5|$|By mid 1916, the {{situation}} was becoming increasingly pressing for the German army. With the appointment of Erich Ludendorff to commander of the General Staff, the Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL), in August 1916, the German administration began actively considering the idea of forcibly deporting Belgian workers to Germany to resolve the problem. The policy, encouraged by {{the high levels of}} unemployment in occupied Belgium, marked a wider turn towards more oppressive rule by the German administration. The deportation begun in October 1916 and lasted until March 1917. In all, as many as 120,000 workers had been deported to Germany {{by the end of the}} war. Of these, around 2,500 died <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> conditions in which the workers were held. In addition, in the Staging Zone, around 62,000 workers were conscripted as forced labour on local military projects in poor conditions.|$|E

5|$|Sharon Newman is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from The Young and the Restless, an American soap opera on the CBS network, currently portrayed by Sharon Case. Created by William J.

Before Case {{took over in}} September 1994, the character was portrayed briefly by Monica Potter and then by Heidi Mark. When first introduced, Sharon {{was a young girl}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> side of town. Nick and Sharon married, had a son named Noah, and later won custody of Cassie, the child a teenaged Sharon had given up for adoption. Their marriage faced a number of problems, including infidelity on both sides. Following Cassie's death in an automobile accident, Nick cheated on Sharon with Phyllis Summers, resulting in a pregnancy which ended their 11-year marriage.|$|E
5|$|Those Kilabi tribesmen {{who were}} not massacred were thrown into the dungeons of Aleppo's citadel. To gain their freedom, Muqallid ibn Za'ida, a Kilabi {{chieftain}} who {{did not attend the}} banquet, rallied his tribal forces and placed pressure on Mansur by besieging Kafartab, south of Aleppo. Mansur subsequently decided to show good faith by moving the Kilabi prisoners to better facilities and giving particularly favorable treatment to Muqallid's brothers, Jami' and Hamid. However, Mansur shortly after rescinded these good faith measures following Muqallid's death at Kafartab and the dispersal of his tribesmen. Mansur executed several Kilabi chieftains in captivity, and tortured others, while many died <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> conditions they were kept in. The contemporary Aleppine historian, Yahya al-Antaki, wrote that Mansur managed to induce some Kilabi chieftains to accept his terms, and released a small group of tribesmen in 1013.|$|E

5|$|Pacifism slowly {{began to}} emerge after the war, but very few war {{memorials}} communicated a pacifist message, largely because in the 1920s, most in the victorious countries felt that the war, while costly in human life, had been worth fighting. Anti-war protests in the inter-war years did use war memorials, however, as locations to communicate their messages; the Communist party in France, for example, held rallies at them. In Britain, political views about the war influenced attitudes towards memorial design and the ceremonies that surrounded them. Those who supported the war were keen to see the ideals of justice and freedom embodied in the designs; those who opposed the conflict sought memorials that would convince people to avoid future slaughter. The opening of {{the tomb of the}} Unknown Soldier was criticised for what anti-war campaigners felt was its pro-war pomp and ceremony, and the burial of the Unknown Soldier in Westminster raised controversy between those who liked the ceremony, and those who thought that the pageantry was designed to distract <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> living conditions faced by the survivors of the war.|$|E

25|$|Many {{studies have}} {{documented}} how {{nuclear power plants}} generate 16% of global electricity, but provide only 6.3% of energy production and 2.6% of final energy consumption.

50|$|A common {{criticism}} {{is that fair}} trade helps the rich rather than <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> farmers. Fair trade is profitable for traders in rich countries.It is also aimed at richer farmers. In order to join fair trade, cooperatives must meet quality and political standards which means their farmers must be relatively skilful, educated and well capitalized, and critics point out that these farmers are, therefore, far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> farmers. <b>The</b> majority of fair tradesuppliers are in the higher income or middle income Third World countries, such as Costa Rica and Mexico, with relatively few in <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> countries. Mexico has 70 times the GNP per head of Sierra Leone. The minimum wage of agricultural workers in Peru is $3 a day and the average income of Fairtrade farmers in Bolivia was US$900/year, very much higher than normal agricultural incomes in Africa and much of Asia. Again, critics say this is diverting money <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> farmers.|$|R
