A study will be performed on a MS level to describe the demand of <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> by different sectors (i. e. industrial, residential), demand types (different temperatures) and supply technologies. This work aims to analyze the current situation and future trends of <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> demand in the EU, as well as, the use and availability of industrial. Within each sector the demand will be presented for different segments. The focus is to map the demand of <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> on temperature intervals possible to be supplied by district heating, district cooling or CHP.

5|$|Commercial solar {{water heaters}} began {{appearing}} in the United States in the 1890s. These systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels. As with photovoltaics, solar water heating attracted renewed attention {{as a result of}} the oil crises in the 1970s but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices. Development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and annual growth rates have averaged 20% since 1999.

5|$|The {{resistive}} Joule {{heating effect}} employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is versatile and controllable, {{it can be}} seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling,</b> the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.|$|E
5|$|Deciduous {{trees and}} {{plants have been}} {{promoted}} {{as a means of}} controlling solar <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling.</b> When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter. Since bare, leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating. In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain.|$|E

5|$|Thermal mass is any {{material}} {{that can be}} used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> equipment.|$|E
5|$|While {{several new}} {{buildings}} have been planned, {{many of the}} changes that had been proposed to the Ghetto in the previous master plan are no longer included in the new plan. The largest feature affecting the student neighborhoods is a new building to the east of Alberta Street, between Chambers Street and Obell Court, on the Darkside. According to the draft of the master plan, the building is intended to be a sustainable residence hall, a 75- to 90-bed facility that would also include an educational wing. The proposed building would use technologies such as solar energy, geothermal <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling,</b> compost piles and low-flow showers. The plan also calls for a walk/bike greenway to link the neighborhood to the core of campus and the athletic complex.|$|E
5|$|Air {{compression}} on {{the outer}} surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight. Every surface, such as windows and panels, was warm to the touch {{by the end of}} the flight. Besides engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is the nose, due to aerodynamic heating. The engineers used Hiduminium R.R. 58, an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft because of its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was , which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02. Concorde went through two cycles of <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the metallurgical and fatigue modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing. The Concorde airframe was designed for a life of 45,000 flying hours.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the Princess was {{considered}} a showpiece of elegance and modernity. It was the first building west of Winnipeg to be faced with marble. The Edmonton Journal remarked {{on the quality of}} the “photoplay house’s” finishings, remarking on the solid marble facade, frescoes, brass mirrors and the abundance of gold leaf decoration. On the technical side, two modern projectors were housed in their own fireproof machine room. The Princess was serviced by a freight elevator, which was an unusual feature for a building of its size, and the theatre lighting was indirect and gentle on theatregoers’ eyes. The Journal was also impressed by three novel firsts for a movie theatre in Edmonton: an electric ticketing machine, an “electric time-projecting clock”, and a refrigerated drinking fountain. Perhaps most importantly, the forced air ventilation system was capable of filtering, <b>heating,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> air and featured dedicated intake and output fans making the Princess by far the most comfortable theatre in Edmonton.|$|E

Landscaping includes using drought resistant native species to reduce the need for irrigation. The floor-based HVAC system is more energy {{efficient and}} helps keep the temperature of the entire building more even and uses radiant <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling.</b> Additionally, the construction used environmentally friendly sealants, carpets, paints, and adhesives as well as preventing 90% of the construction waste from entering landfills. Also, potable water usage is reduced by 40% due to the use of low-flow sinks, showers, and toilets.

40|$|Effective {{design of}} {{energy-efficient}} buildings requires attention to energy issues during the preliminary stages of design. To {{aid in the}} early consideration of a building's future energy usage, a simplified building energy analysis model was developed. Using this model, a new computer program was written in C/C++ to calculate annual <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> loads for residential buildings and {{to provide information about}} the relative importance of load contributions from the different building components. Estimates were made regarding the uncertainties of parameter inputs to the model, such as material properties, <b>heat</b> transfer coefficients <b>and</b> infiltration rates. The new computer program was used to determine the sensitivity of annual <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> loads to model input uncertainties. From the results of these sensitivity studies, it was estimated that the overall uncertainties in the annual sensible <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> load predictions amount to approximately ± 30 % and ± 40 %, respectively, for two buildings studied in Boston, Massachusetts. Further model simplification techniques were implemented that reduced annual load calculation times on a 180 MHz computer to about 8 and 12 seconds for a lightweight and massive building, respectively. The error introduced by these simplifications was approximately 4 % and 10 % for the annual sensible <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> loads, well below the overall uncertainties in the load predictions. Comparison studies were performed with this new computer program and Energy- 10. Overall, good agreement between the programs' annual load predictions was found. by Henry C. Spindler. Thesis (M. S.)
