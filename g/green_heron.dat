5|$|The Austin Heights area {{contains}} Como Lake, {{a renowned}} urban fishing and recreation area, and headwaters for the Como watershed. The watershed {{represents one of}} the last urban watersheds in the Tri-Cities that supports wild stocks of coho salmon as well as other species at risk such as coastal cutthroat trout (both sea-run and resident) and bird species such as the great blue heron and <b>green</b> <b>heron.</b> It also contains Mundy Park, one of the largest urban parks in the Metro Vancouver area.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to bald eagles, which {{live in the}} IBA year round and have successfully established a breeding population there, the IBA is home to belted kingfishers, scarlet tanagers, black-throated blue warblers, common mergansers, blue and <b>green</b> <b>heron,</b> hermit thrushes, and wood ducks. Large numbers of ospreys use the gorge during spring and fall migration periods. The woodlands are inhabited by the ruffed grouse, Pennsylvania's state bird, and wild turkeys. Swainson's thrush breeds in the IBA and the northern harrier breeds and overwinters in Pine Creek Gorge.|$|E
25|$|Water fowl which {{visit the}} Preserve include the great blue heron, the <b>green</b> <b>heron,</b> and the pied-billed grebe.|$|E

5000|$|At Alligator Pond, an open-sided {{observation}} tower provides excellent views of alligators, purple gallinules, moorhens, <b>green</b> <b>herons</b> and other wildlife.|$|R
50|$|Birds {{in central}} Panama with buff necks have been {{considered}} to be hybrids between the two species, but the occurrence of similar birds beyond the range of migratory <b>green</b> <b>herons</b> {{means that there is}} still doubt about the species' limits of the Butorides herons.|$|R
25|$|The <b>green</b> <b>heron</b> (Butorides virescens) and {{its sister}} species the {{striated}} heron (Butorides striata) {{have been recorded}} using food (bread crusts), insects, leaves, and other small objects as bait to attract fish, which they then capture and eat.|$|E
25|$|Two other birds, in {{addition}} to the blue bird and scarlet ibis {{can be seen in the}} composition, one of which resembles a <b>green</b> <b>heron.</b> A large steamship can be seen bellowing gaseous vapor from its funnel in the distant sea or ocean, and a smaller boat (or canot) is visible below.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, {{this species}} was {{formerly}} included in B. striata, which {{at that time}} was erroneously known as B. striatus. The Early Pleistocene B. validipes, whose fossil remains were discovered in Florida, might have been the ancestor of the <b>green</b> <b>heron</b> as the living species seems to replace the extinct relative in the fossil record.|$|E
50|$|Avifauna in the wild, both {{native and}} {{migrating}} include brown pelican {{along the shore}} line, magnificent frigatebirds with long wingspans of up to 1.8 m, <b>green</b> <b>herons,</b> snowy egrets, belted kingfishers; bananaquits; broad-winged hawks; two species of hummingbirds, the green-throated carib and Antillean crested hummingbird; and zenaida doves.|$|R
2500|$|Restoration {{with native}} plants has drawn a great {{diversity}} of wildlife to this urban pond including {{many species of}} birds, turtles, frogs, {{and even a few}} beavers. [...] Great blue herons, black-crowned night <b>herons,</b> <b>green</b> <b>herons,</b> mallards, wood ducks, song sparrows and woodpeckers can regularly be spotted at the North Pond Nature Sanctuary.|$|R
50|$|Ochsner Island on {{the east}} side of the park {{features}} a rookery that is one of the prime birding spots in Greater New Orleans. The island attracts hundreds of wading birds, including great egrets, cattle egrets, snowy egrets, ibis, little blue <b>herons,</b> <b>green</b> <b>herons,</b> night herons and others. The park is also home to diving double-crested cormorants and anhingas, as well as to many species of ducks. Recently, black-bellied whistling ducks have begun using the park's lagoons as a stopover on their migrations.|$|R
25|$|Green herons {{are one of}} the few {{species of}} animal known to use tools. In particular, they {{commonly}} use bread crusts, insects, or other items as bait. The bait is dropped onto the surface of a body of water in order to lure fish. When a fish takes the bait, the <b>green</b> <b>heron</b> will then grab and eat the fish.|$|E
25|$|Ardeidaes rest in salty ponds (snowy egret, <b>green</b> <b>heron,</b> western cattle egret, yellow-crowned night heron, tricolored heron, etc.) {{and living}} with the aquatic turtles, the common moorhen, the blue land crab, the blackback land crab, the sand fiddler crab and other species of crabs. The common kestrel is easily visible and audible during rides into the dry forest, like the zenaida dove, an endemic species of West Indies {{protected}} inside the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|The clutch {{is usually}} 2–6 pale green eggs, which are laid in 2-day {{intervals}} (though the second egg may be laid up to 6 days {{later than the}} first). After the last egg has been laid, both parents incubate for about 19–21 days until hatching, and feed the young birds. The frequency of feedings decreases as the offspring near fledging. The young sometimes start to leave the nest at 16 days of age, but are not fully fledged and able {{to fend for themselves}} until 30–35 days old. Sometimes – particularly in the tropical parts of its range – the <b>green</b> <b>heron</b> breeds twice a year.|$|E
50|$|The WMA is {{bisected}} by Maryland Route 90, {{one of the}} {{two principal}} highway routes into Ocean City. Despite this, the WMA attracts many birds, especially those dependent upon tidal marshes and bays, including great blue <b>herons</b> and <b>green</b> <b>herons,</b> black ducks, buffleheads, scaup, brant, Canada and snow geese, the common loon, and swans.|$|R
5|$|Wading and {{woodland}} {{birds are}} year-round residents of Pettigrew State Park. The banks of Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River provide {{an abundance of}} cover and food for sandpipers, great blue herons, great egrets, and <b>green</b> <b>herons.</b> The woods are home to bobwhites, pileated woodpeckers, woodcocks, red-cockaded woodpeckers, and mourning doves. Songbirds found at the park include prairie and prothonotary warblers, common yellowthroats and northern parulas.|$|R
50|$|The lagoon, at most 8 ft deep, {{is home to}} red snappers, gruntfish, sardines, {{swordfish}} {{and black}} mullets.Oysters cling to the mangrove roots.Birds that feed in the lagoon include scarlet ibis, red-legged tinamous, frigatebirds, blue <b>herons,</b> <b>green</b> <b>herons,</b> great egrets, ground doves, cormorants and flamingos.Three endemic land species are present: the deer Odocoileus carriacou margaritae, the rabbit Sylvilagus floridanus margaritae and the snake Leptotyphlops albifrons margaritae.|$|R
25|$|As {{trees are}} drowned by rising beaver impoundments, they become ideal nesting sites for woodpeckers, which carve {{cavities}} that attract many other bird species, including flycatchers (Empidonax spp.), tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), tits (Paridae spp.), wood ducks (Aix sponsa), goldeneyes (Bucephala spp.), mergansers (Mergus spp.), owls (Tytonidae, Strigidae) and American kestrels (Falco sparverius). Piscivores, including herons (Ardea spp.), grebes (Podicipedidae), cormorants (Phalacrocorax ssp.), American bitterns (Botaurus lentiginosa), great egret (Ardea alba), snowy egret (Egretta thula), mergansers, and belted kingfishers (Megaceryle alcyon), use beaver ponds for fishing. Hooded mergansers (Lophodytes cucullatus), <b>green</b> <b>heron</b> (Butorides virescens), {{great blue heron}} (Ardea herodias) and belted kingfisher appeared more frequently in New York wetlands where beaver were active than at sites with no beaver activity.|$|E
25|$|The fish {{population}} draws birds to {{the waters of}} Holman Lake. Bald eagles and osprey do not nest at Little Buffalo State Park, but they do fish the waters. Great blue heron and <b>green</b> <b>heron</b> wade in the shallows of the lake in search of fish, frogs and crayfish. Wood ducks make their home at the lake along with mallards and Canadian geese. The woods and field surrounding the lake are {{the home of the}} once rare bluebird. These birds became endangered due to the loss habitat. They nested only in tree cavities. People have helped the bluebird by constructing birdhouses that mimic the woodpecker holes that bluebirds would naturally use to build their nests. Turkeys and ruffed grouse live in and thrive in the forests of Little Buffalo State Park.|$|E
25|$|In the Caribbean 600 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} of which 163 are endemic such as the tody, Fernandina's flicker and palmchat. The American yellow warbler is found in many areas as is the <b>green</b> <b>heron.</b> Of the endemic species 48 are threatened with extinction including the Puerto Rican amazon, yellow-breasted crake and the Zapata wren. According to Birdlife International in 2006 in Cuba 29 species of bird {{are in danger of}} extinction and two species officially extinct. The black-fronted piping guan is endangered as is the plain pigeon. The Antilles along with Central America lie in the flight path of migrating birds from North America so the size of populations is subject to seasonal fluctuations. In the forests are found parrots, bananaquit and toucans. Over the open sea can be seen frigatebirds and tropicbirds.|$|E

50|$|Before they mysteriously {{disappeared}} in 1995, {{a number of}} species have been spotted at the Sanctuary, including snowy egrets, glossy ibis, black-crowned and yellow-crowned night herons, little blue <b>herons,</b> <b>green</b> <b>herons</b> and tri-colored herons. In 2003, The Wetlands Institute identified the American redstart, black and white warbler, black-throated blue warbler, downy woodpecker and sharp-shinned hawk, {{but none of the}} egrets and herons that were traditionally identified with the area. In 2005, a number of feral cats were trapped and removed from the site, leading to fines for anyone caught feeding stray cats without a license.|$|R
25|$|The {{habitat of}} the <b>green</b> <b>heron</b> is small {{wetlands}} in low-lying areas. The species is most conspicuous during dusk and dawn, {{and if anything}} these birds are nocturnal rather than diurnal, preferring to retreat to sheltered areas in daytime. They feed actively during the day, however, if hungry or provisioning young. Shore-living individuals adapt {{to the rhythm of}} the tides. They mainly eat small fish, frogs and aquatic arthropods, but may take any invertebrate or vertebrate prey they can catch, including such animals like leeches and mice. Green herons are intolerant of other birds – including conspecifics – when feeding and are not seen to forage in groups. They typically stand still on shore or in shallow water or perch upon branches and await prey. Sometimes they drop food, insects, or other small objects on the water's surface to attract fish, making them one of the few known tool-using species. This feeding method has led some to title the green and closely related striated heron as among the world's most intelligent birds. They are able to hover briefly to catch prey.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>green</b> <b>heron</b> (Butorides virescens) {{is a small}} heron of North and Central America. Butorides is from Middle English butor [...] "bittern" [...] and Ancient Greek -oides, [...] "resembling", and virescens is Latin for [...] "greenish".|$|E
2500|$|The <b>green</b> <b>heron</b> is {{relatively}} small; adult body length is about [...] The neck is often pulled in tight against the body. Adults have a glossy, greenish-black cap, a greenish back and wings that are grey-black grading into green or blue, a chestnut {{neck with a}} white line down the front, grey underparts and short yellow legs. The bill is dark with a long, sharp point. Female adults tend to be smaller than males, and have duller and lighter plumage, particularly in the breeding season. Juveniles are duller, with the head sides, neck and underparts streaked brown and white, tan-splotched back and wing coverts, and greenish-yellow legs and bill. Hatchlings are covered in down feathers, light grey above, and white on the belly.|$|E
50|$|Black Bayou Lake is {{studded with}} cypress and tupelo trees, and {{surrounded}} by swamps that graduate into bottomland hardwoods and then into upland mixed pine/hardwoods. Cherrybark oak, cedar elm, ash, hickories and willow oak dominate the lower areas while shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, mockernut hickory and post oak dominate the upland sites. Common wildlife seen include alligators, wood ducks, bird-voiced treefrogs, broad-banded water snakes, red-eared sliders, <b>green</b> <b>herons,</b> coyotes, skunks, and white-tailed deer. The refuge supports an excellent fisheries resource and provides valuable habitat for migratory waterfowl, neotropical migratory songbirds, and many resident wildlife species.|$|R
50|$|The Klamath Basin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} staging areas for migrant waterfowl in the United States. The upland slopes of Moore Park provide viewing of many species of migrant and nesting forest birds, including bald eagles. From the hills and the shore areas of Moore Park, including Putnam Point, black-crowned night herons, Clark's and western grebes are frequently spotted, as well as snowy egrets, <b>green</b> <b>herons,</b> Barrow's goldeneyes, hooded merganser and tree swallows. Several species of warblers can be seen during the spring, including: yellow-rumped, yellow, Wilson's and orange-crowned warblers.|$|R

60|$|On the 14th of March we {{proceeded}} west to Siligoree, {{along the}} skirts of the ragged Sal forest. Birds are {{certainly the most}} conspicuous branch of {{the natural history of}} this country, and we saw many species, interesting either from their habits, beauty, or extensive distribution. We noticed no less than sixteen kinds of swimming birds, several of which are migratory and English. The Shoveller, white-eyed and common wild ducks; Merganser, Brahminee, and Indian goose (Anser Indica); common and Gargany teal; two kinds of gull; one of Shearwater (Rhynchops ablacus); three of tern, and one of cormorant. Besides these there were three egrets, the large crane, stork, <b>green</b> <b>heron,</b> and the demoiselle; the English sand-martin, kingfisher, peregrine-falcon, sparrow-hawk, kestrel, and the European vulture: the wild peacock, and jungle-fowl. There were at least 100 peculiarly Indian birds in addition, of which the more remarkable were several kinds of mina, of starling, vulture, kingfisher, magpie, quail, and lapwing.|$|E

Our own sand-hill and whooping cranes are notorious dancers; and undoubtedly it is more or less instinctive with all the tribes of the cranes and herons, from the least to the greatest. But what the instinct means--unless, like our own dancing, it is a pure bit of pleasure-making, as crows play games and loons swim races--nobody can tell.|$|R
5|$|Waterfowl at {{the refuge}} include Canada Geese, Wood Ducks, swans, Northern Pintails, <b>Green</b> <b>Herons,</b> teal, mergansers, Belted Kingfishers, and American Wigeon among others.
