40|$|<b>Hints</b> are an {{important}} ingredient of natural language tutorial dialogues. Existing models of <b>hints,</b> however, are limited in capturing their various underlying functions, since <b>hints</b> are typically treated as a unit directly associated with some problem solving script or discourse situation. Putting emphasis on making cognitive functions of <b>hints</b> explicit and allowing for automatic incorporation in a natural dialogue context, we developed a multidimensional <b>hint</b> taxonomy where each dimension defines a decision point for the associated function. We take domain knowledge into account for choosing the <b>hint</b> to be given {{with regard to the}} domainknowledge dimension only. In this paper we show how structured domain knowledge can be used to inform the choice of an appropriate <b>hint</b> class and the specification of the <b>hint</b> to be produced...|$|R
40|$|Intelligent {{tutoring}} {{systems can}} support students in solving multi-step tasks {{by providing a}} <b>hint</b> regarding what to do next. However, engineering such next-step <b>hints</b> manually or using an expert model becomes infeasible if the space of possible states is too large. Therefore, several approaches have emerged to infer next-step <b>hints</b> automatically, relying on past student's data. Such <b>hints</b> typically have {{the form of an}} edit which could have been performed by capable students in the given situation, based on what past capable students have done. In this contribution we provide a mathematical framework to analyze edit-based <b>hint</b> policies and, based on this theory, propose a novel <b>hint</b> policy to provide edit <b>hints</b> for learning tasks with a vast state space and sparse student data. We call this technique the continuous <b>hint</b> factory because it embeds student data in a continuous space, in which the most likely edit can be inferred in a probabilistic sense, similar to the <b>hint</b> factory. In our experimental evaluation we demonstrate that the continuous <b>hint</b> factory can predict what capable students would do in solving a multi-step programming task and that <b>hints</b> provided by the continuous <b>hint</b> factory match to some extent the edit <b>hints</b> that human tutors would have given in the same situation.

40|$|The {{histidine}} triad nucleotide-binding (<b>Hint</b> 2) {{protein is}} a mitochondrial adenosine phosphoramidase expressed in liver and pancreas. Its physiological function is unknown. To elucidate {{the role of}} <b>Hint</b> 2 in liver physiology, the <b>Hint</b> 2 gene was deleted. <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) and <b>Hint</b> 2 (+/+) mice were generated in a mixed C 57 Bl 6 /J x 129 Sv background. At 20 weeks, the phenotypic changes in <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) relative to <b>Hint</b> 2 (+/+) mice were an accumulation of hepatic triglycerides, decreased tolerance to glucose, a defective counter-regulatory response to insulin-provoked hypoglycaemia, an increase in plasma interprandial insulin but a decrease in glucose stimulated insulin secretion and defective thermoregulation upon fasting. Leptin mRNA in adipose tissue and plasma leptin were elevated. In mitochondria from <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) hepatocytes, state 3 respiration was decreased, a finding confirmed in HepG 2 cells where <b>HINT</b> 2 mRNA was silenced. The linked complex II to III electron transfer was decreased in <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) mitochondria, which {{was accompanied by a}} lower content of coenzyme Q. HIF- 2 α expression and the generation of reactive oxygen species were increased. Electron microscopy of mitochondria in <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) mice aged 12 months revealed clustered, fused organelles. The hepatic activities of 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase short chain and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) were decreased by 68 % and 60 %, respectively, without a change in protein expression. GDH activity was similarly decreased in <b>HINT</b> 2 -silenced HepG 2 cells. When measured in the presence of purified sirtuin 3, latent GDH activity was recovered (126 % in <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) vs. 83 % in <b>Hint</b> 2 (+/+)). This suggests a greater extent of acetylation in <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) than in <b>Hint</b> 2 (+/+). Conlusions: <b>Hint</b> 2 positively regulates mitochondrial lipid metabolism and respiration, and glucose homeostasis. The absence of <b>Hint</b> 2 provokes mitochondrial deformities and a change in the pattern of acetylation of selected proteins. (HEPATOLOGY 2012.) ...|$|R

40|$|A student {{using an}} {{interactive}} learning environment (ILE) may take multiple attempts {{to solve a}} problem step, at times using <b>hints.</b> But how effective are <b>hints?</b> Because data mining occasionally finds implausible negative effects of <b>hints,</b> a method is needed to remove selection effects related to <b>hint</b> use. We distinguish multiple attempts in which a student repeatedly seeks <b>hints</b> from multiple attempts to answer the problem. Exploratory analysis of log data from a tutoring system shows that making a <b>hint</b> request rather on the first attempt on a problem step correlates with <b>hint</b> requests on subsequent attempts, and proficiency on a first attempt correlates with proficiency on subsequent attempts. Based on this, we devise a multinomial logistic regression that distinguishes hint-request tendency from proficiency. We find that seeking just one <b>hint</b> is associated with repeated hint-seeking, but when students do make attempts {{to solve a problem}} after viewing a <b>hint,</b> they succeed about half of the time. Thus, the model removes seemingly negative “effects” of <b>hints.</b> We also find that individual differences among students are more prominent in hint-seeking tendency than in proficiency with <b>hints.</b> We conclude with some ideas to improve our model...|$|R

30|$|In the trial, {{most of the}} {{students}} used the <b>hint</b> function although some of {{the students}} also reflected that they did not understand the <b>hints.</b> They expressed that the <b>hints</b> could be in a form that is easier to understand.

40|$|The {{systematic}} use of <b>hints</b> in the learning-from-examples {{paradigm is}} the subject of this review. <b>Hints</b> are the properties of the target function that are known to us independently of the training examples. The use of <b>hints</b> is tantamount to combining rules and data in learning, and is compatible with different learning models, optimization techniques, and regularization techniques. The <b>hints</b> are represented to the learning process by virtual examples, and the training examples of the target function are treated on equal footing with the rest of the <b>hints.</b> A balance is achieved between the information provided by the different <b>hints</b> through the choice of objective functions and learning schedules. The Adaptive Minimization algorithm achieves this balance by relating the performance on each <b>hint</b> to the overall performance. The application of <b>hints</b> in forecasting the very noisy foreign-exchange markets is illustrated. On the theoretical side, the information value of <b>hints</b> is contrasted to the complexity value and related to the VC dimension...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of PhysicsBrett D. DePaolaNobel S. RebelloPrevious {{research}} has showed that visual cues can improve learners' problem solving performance on conceptual physics tasks. In {{this study we}} investigated the influence of multimedia <b>hints</b> that included visual, textual, and audio modalities, and all possible combinations thereof, on students' problem solving performance and visual attention. The participants (N = 162) were recruited from conceptual physics classes for this study. Each of them participated in an individual interview, which contained four task sets. Each set contained one initial task, six training tasks, one near transfer task and one far transfer task. We used a 2 (visual hint/no visual <b>hint)</b> x 2 (text hint/no text <b>hint)</b> x 2 (audio hint/no audio <b>hint)</b> between participant quasi-experimental design. Participants were randomly assigned {{into one of the}} eight conditions and were provided <b>hints</b> for training tasks, corresponding to the assigned condition. Our results showed that problem solving performance on the training tasks was affected by <b>hint</b> modality. Unlike what was predicted by Mayer's modality principle, we found evidence of a reverse modality effect, in which text <b>hints</b> helped participants solve the physics tasks better than audio <b>hints.</b> Then we studied students’ visual attention as they solved these physics tasks. We found the participants preferentially attended to visual <b>hints</b> over text <b>hints</b> when they were presented simultaneously. This effect was unaffected by the inclusion of audio <b>hints.</b> Text <b>hints</b> also imposed less cognitive load than audio <b>hints,</b> as measured by fixation durations. And presenting visual <b>hints</b> caused more cognitive load while fixating expert-like interest areas than during the time intervals before and after <b>hints.</b> A theoretical model is proposed to explain both problem solving performance and visual attention. According to the model, because visual <b>hints</b> integrated the functions of selection, organization, and integration, this caused a relatively heavy cognitive load yet improved problem solving performance. Furthermore, text <b>hints</b> were a better resource for complex linguistic information than transient audio <b>hints.</b> We also discuss limitations of the current study, which may have led to results contrary to Mayer's modality principle in some respects, but consistent with it in others...|$|R
40|$|Collaborative caching allows {{software}} to use <b>hints</b> to influence cache management in hardware. Previous theories {{have shown that}} such <b>hints</b> observe the inclusion property and can obtain optimal caching if the access sequence and the cache size are known ahead of time. Previously, the interface of a cache <b>hint</b> is limited, e. g., a binary choice between LRU and MRU. In this paper, we generalize the <b>hint</b> interface, where a <b>hint</b> is a number encoding a priority. We show the generality in a hierarchical relation where collaborative caching subsumes noncollaborative caching, and within collaborative caching, the priority <b>hint</b> subsumes the previous binary <b>hint.</b> We show two theoretical results for the general <b>hint.</b> The first is a new cache replacement policy, priority LRU, which permits the complete range of choices between MRU and LRU. We prove {{a new type of}} inclusion property—non-uniform inclusion—and give a one-pass algorithm to compute the miss rate for all cache sizes. Second, we show that priority <b>hints</b> can enable the use of the same <b>hints</b> to obtain optimal caching for all cache sizes, without having to know the cache size beforehand...|$|R
