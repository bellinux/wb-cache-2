50|$|In physics, an oscillon is a soliton-like {{phenomenon}} {{that occurs in}} granular and other dissipative media. Oscillons in granular media result from vertically vibrating a plate {{with a layer of}} uniform particles placed freely on top. When the sinusoidal vibrations are of the correct amplitude and frequency and the layer of sufficient thickness, a localized wave, referred to as an oscillon, can be formed by locally disturbing the particles. This meta-stable state will remain for a long time (many hundreds of thousands of oscillations) in the absence of further perturbation. An oscillon changes form with each collision of the <b>grain</b> <b>layer</b> and the plate, switching between a peak that projects above the <b>grain</b> <b>layer</b> to a crater like depression with a small rim. This self-sustaining state was named by analogy with the soliton, which is a localized wave that maintains its integrity as it moves. Whereas solitons occur as travelling waves in a fluid or as electromagnetic waves in a waveguide oscillons may be stationary.|$|E

The heterojunction of about 2 μm consists of n-type Cu₂O (~ 1 μm) and p-type CuO (~ 1 μm) thin films bi-layer. Scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) show the existence of two different polycrystalline <b>grain</b> <b>layers</b> and the XRD reveals that the different <b>grain</b> <b>layers</b> are high quality CuO-type and Cu₂O-type structures respectively.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{clarified}} a novel {{strategy to}} improve the tensile properties of the Ti- 48 Al- 2 Cr- 2 Nb alloys fabricated by electron beam melting (EBM), via the finding {{of the development of}} unique layered microstructure composed of duplex-like fine <b>grains</b> <b>layers</b> and coarser γ <b>grains</b> <b>layers.</b> It was clarified that the mechanical properties of the alloy fabricated by EBM can be controlled by varying an angle θ between EBM-building directions and stress loading direction. At room temperature, the yield strength exhibits high values more than 550 MPa at all the loading orientations investigated (θ= 0, 45 and 90 °). In addition, the elongation at θ= 45 ° was surprisingly larger than 2 %, owing to the development of this unique layered microstructure. The anisotropy of the yield strength decreased with increasing temperature. All the examined alloys exhibited a brittle-ductile transition temperature of approximately 750 °C and the yield strength and tensile elongation at 800 °C were over 350 MPa and 40 %, respectively. By the detailed observation of the microstructure, the formation mechanism of the unique layered microstructure was found to be closely related to the repeated local heat treatment effect during the EBM process, and thus its control is further possible by the tuning-up of the process parameters. The results demonstrate that the EBM process enables not only the fabrication of TiAl products with complex shape but also the control of the tensile properties associated with the peculiar microstructure formed during the process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There is {{the grade}} {{as one of}} the {{selection}} criteria of a grinding wheel like WA whetstone or GC whetstone. The grade of grinding wheel is defined as an index which shows the strength of connection of a grain and a grain, and is usually estimated by bending strength. There are many papers about the relationship between the grade of a grinding wheel and the grinding performance. Relationship between the grade of a grinding wheel and the grinding performance is almost clear. Also, the relationship between mechanical properties of a grinding wheel and the grade is also clear. On the other hand, since the <b>grain</b> <b>layer</b> of a super abrasive grinding wheel is thin, it is difficult to apply the conventional evaluation test of the grade. The evaluation method of the grade which can be adapted the super abrasive grinding wheel is not established. In addition, since the grade of a super abrasive grinding wheel is a manufacture manufacturer's original standard, there is a minute difference by manufacturer. The super abrasive grinding wheel as well as the grinding wheel is conjectured that the grade influences the grinding performance. Namely, it is important to relate the grade and the mechanical properties of a <b>grain</b> <b>layer.</b> However, researches which relate the grade, the grinding performance and the mechanical properties of a super abrasive grinding wheel are not done so far.

An {{investigation}} of {{the application of a}} multi scale CAFE model to prediction of the strain localization phenomena in industrial processes, such as extrusion, is presented in this work.
