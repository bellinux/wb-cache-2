5|$|After the Congress of Vienna {{there was}} a degree of {{commercial}} cooperation between the various German states resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> the German Customs Union (Zollverein). There were however still many barriers to trade until Bavaria {{took the lead in}} establishing the General German Commercial Code in 1856. As part of the code the Zollverein introduce the Zollpfund (Customs Pound) which was defined to be exactly 500g and which could be split into 30'lot'. This unit was used for inter-state movement of goods, but was not applied in all states for internal use.|$|E

In 1858, French pediatrician Eugène Bouchut (1818–1891) developed a new technique for non-surgical orotracheal intubation to bypass laryngeal obstruction resulting from a diphtheria-related pseudomembrane. In 1880, Scottish surgeon William Macewen (1848–1924) reported on his use of orotracheal intubation as an alternative to tracheotomy to allow a patient with glottic edema to breathe, as well as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> general anesthesia with chloroform.

5|$|Subarachnoid blood can be {{detected}} on CT scanning {{in as many as}} 60 percent of people with traumatic brain injury. Traumatic SAH (tSAH) usually occurs near the site of a skull fracture or intracerebral contusion. It usually happens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> other forms of traumatic brain injury and has been linked with a poorer prognosis. It is unclear, however, if this {{is a direct result of}} the SAH or whether the presence of subarachnoid blood is simply an indicator of severity of the head injury and the prognosis is determined by other associated mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Given that {{ascending}} cholangitis usually occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> {{bile duct}} obstruction, {{various forms of}} medical imaging may be employed to identify the site and nature of this obstruction. The first investigation is usually ultrasound, as {{this is the most}} easily available. Ultrasound may show dilation of the bile duct and identifies 38% of bile duct stones; it is relatively poor at identifying stones farther down the bile duct. Ultrasound can help distinguish between cholangitis and cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), which has similar symptoms to cholangitis but appears differently on ultrasound. A better test is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), which uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); this has a comparable sensitivity to ERCP. Smaller stones, however, can still be missed on MRCP depending {{on the quality of the}} hospital's facilities.|$|E
5|$|Intubation may be {{necessary}} for a patient with decreased oxygen content and oxygen saturation of the blood caused when their breathing is inadequate (hypoventilation), suspended (apnea), or when the lungs are unable to sufficiently transfer gasses to the blood. Such patients, who may be awake and alert, are typically critically ill with a multisystem disease or multiple severe injuries. Examples of such conditions include cervical spine injury, multiple rib fractures, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or near-drowning. Specifically, intubation is considered if the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is less than 60millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) while breathing an inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) of 50% or greater. In patients with elevated arterial carbon dioxide, an arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) greater than 45mm Hg <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> acidemia would prompt intubation, especially if a series of measurements demonstrate a worsening respiratory acidosis. Regardless of the laboratory values, these guidelines are always interpreted in the clinical context.|$|E

In January 2008, a 17-year-old suspect from Bergoo was formally charged with a felony count of arson for setting fire to the tree, while a second juvenile was also charged with a misdemeanor for providing false information to investigators.

5|$|The three member team is {{composed}} of Edward Tolby, his daughter, Silvia Tolby (of unspecified age, but vaguely described as an adolescent or young adult), and their mutual friend, Robert Penn. While {{en route to the}} valley, the team arrives in a small rural town by the name of Fairfax. Fairfax is littered with ancient, decaying gadgets; the last remnants of the era of governments and high tech society, which none of the locals know how to fix or reproduce. Excited by the strangers, the locals ask about the League. Tolby answers their questions in turn, ending with an explanation of the timeline of events which led up to the great revolt. The event is summarized as having begun with revolts in Europe which overthrow the national governments. After France exists for a month free of government, millions join the by then explicitly anarchist movement to disarm the nuclear powers. At each toppled government center, millions of records are burned and government integration robots are destroyed.

In this work, we present (1) near-tight bounds on the magnitude <b>of</b> change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> maximal bicliques of a graph, due to a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>set</b> (2) a "change-sensitive" algorithm for enumerating <b>the</b> change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> maximal bicliques, whose time complexity {{is proportional to the}} magnitude of change that actually occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> maximal bicliques <b>in</b> <b>the</b> graph.
