5|$|LCA is {{used for}} example in the {{building}} sector. Buildings today account for the 40% of the world’s energy use.

Growing interest, space, and attention in the architecture sector are directed to environmental issues according to the principles of green building.

5|$|The wing profile {{remained}} {{the same as the}} F-5E, but had modified leading edge extensions (LEX), which improved the maximum lift coefficient of the wing by about 12% with an increase in wing area of only 1.6%. The original aircraft was fairly sluggish in pitch, so the horizontal stabilizer was increased in size by 30% and a new dual-channel fly-by-wire control system was added. Destabilizing the aircraft in pitch and modifying the LEX improved the instantaneous turn rate by 7% to 20°/sec. Sustained turn rate at Mach0.8 and 15,000ft (4,572m) rose to 11.5°/sec, which compared well with the F-16's 12.8°/sec. Supersonic turn rates were 47% <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the F-5E.|$|E
5|$|Although {{expected}} {{to accommodate the}} needs of the entire workforce, by late 1944 expansion of both the electromagnetic and gaseous diffusion plants led to forecasts of a population of 62,000. This prompted another round of construction that saw an additional 1,300 family units and 20 dormitories built. More shopping and recreational facilities were added, the schools were expanded to accommodate 9,000 students, and a 50-bed annex was added to the hospital. The number of school children reached 8,223 in 1945. Few issues resonated more with the scientists and highly skilled workers than the quality of the education system. Although school staff were nominally employees of the Anderson County Education Board, the school system was run autonomously, with federal funding under the supervision of administrators appointed by the Army. Teachers enjoyed salaries that were considerably <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Anderson County. The population of Oak Ridge peaked at 75,000 in May 1945, by which time 82,000 people were employed at the Clinton Engineer Works, and 10,000 by Roane-Anderson.|$|E

5|$|Calcium {{is a very}} ductile silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose {{properties}} {{are very similar to}} the heavier elements in its group, strontium, barium, and radium. A calcium atom has twenty electrons, arranged in the electron configuration 4s2. Like the other elements placed in group 2 of the periodic table, calcium has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital, which are very easily lost in chemical reactions to form a dipositive ion with the stable electron configuration of a noble gas, in this case argon. Hence, calcium is almost always divalent in its compounds, which are usually ionic. Hypothetical univalent salts of calcium would be stable with respect to their elements, but not to disproportionation to the divalent salts and calcium metal, because the enthalpy of formation of MX2 is much <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the hypothetical MX. This occurs because of the much greater lattice energy afforded by the more highly charged Ca2+ cation compared to the hypothetical Ca+ cation.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{stabilization}} of its outer 8s electron, ununennium's first ionization energy—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 4.53eV, <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the known alkali metals from potassium onward. This effect {{is so large}} that unbiunium (element 121) is predicted to have a lower ionization energy of 4.45eV, so that the alkali metal in period 8 {{would not have the}} lowest ionization energy in the period, as is true for all previous periods. Ununennium's electron affinity is expected to be far greater than that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarizability of ununennium, to 169.7a.u. Indeed, the static dipole polarisability (αD) of ununennium, a quantity for which the impacts of relativity are proportional to the square of the element's atomic number, has been calculated to be small and similar to that of sodium.|$|E
5|$|Fares on BART are {{comparable}} to those of commuter rail systems and are <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> most subways, especially for long trips.

Passengers can use refillable paper-plastic-composite tickets, on which fares are stored via a magnetic strip, to enter and exit the system. The exit faregate prints the remaining balance on the ticket each time the passenger exits the station. A paper ticket can be refilled at a ticket machine, the remaining balance on any ticket can be applied towards the purchase of a new one, or a card is captured by the exit gate when the balance reaches zero; multiple low value cards can be combined to create a larger value card but only at specific ticket exchange locations, located at some BART stations. The magnetic strip-based technology was developed by Cubic Transportation Systems with a contract awarded in 1974.|$|E

No.78 Wing's flying units were originally to have consisted of No.80 Squadron, operating P-40 Kittyhawk fighters, and Nos.452 and 457 Squadrons, operating Spitfires. The Spitfire squadrons could not be released from duty in the North-Western Area as planned, and Nos.75 and 78 Squadrons took their place, making the formation an all-Kittyhawk force. No.78 Wing flew combat air patrols and ground-attack missions during Operation Reckless, the assault on Hollandia and Aitape, New Guinea, in April 1944.

5|$|Sodium at {{standard}} temperature and pressure is a soft silvery metal that combines with oxygen in air and forms grayish white sodium oxide unless immersed in oil or inert gas, {{which are the}} conditions it is usually stored in. Sodium metal can be easily cut with a knife and is a good conductor of electricity and heat because it has only one electron in its valence shell, resulting in weak metallic bonding and free electrons, which carry energy. Due to having low atomic mass and large atomic radius, sodium is third-least dense of all elemental metals {{and is one of}} only three metals that can float on water, the other two being lithium and potassium. The melting (98°C) and boiling (883°C) points of sodium are lower than those of lithium but <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the heavier alkali metals potassium, rubidium, and caesium, following periodic trends down the group. These properties change dramatically at elevated pressures: at 1.5 Mbar, the color changes from silvery metallic to black; at 1.9 Mbar the material becomes transparent with a red color; and at 3 Mbar, sodium is a clear and transparent solid. All of these high-pressure allotropes are insulators and electrides.|$|E
5|$|The {{carbon content}} of steel is between 0.002% and 2.14% by weight for plain ironcarbon alloys. These values vary {{depending}} on alloying elements such as manganese, chromium, nickel, iron, tungsten, carbon and so on. Basically, steel is an iron-carbon alloy that does not undergo eutectic reaction. In contrast, cast iron does undergo eutectic reaction. Too little carbon content leaves (pure) iron quite soft, ductile, and weak. Carbon contents <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> steel make an alloy, commonly called pig iron, that is brittle (not malleable). While iron alloyed with carbon is called carbon steel, alloy steel is steel to which other alloying elements have been intentionally added to modify the characteristics of steel. Common alloying elements include: manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, boron, titanium, vanadium, tungsten, cobalt, and niobium. Additional elements are also important in steel: phosphorus, sulfur, silicon, and traces of oxygen, nitrogen, and copper, that are most frequently considered undesirable.|$|E
