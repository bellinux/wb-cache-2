500|$|Shortly {{after taking}} the oath of office, Truman spoke to reporters: [...] "Boys, if you ever pray, pray for me now. I don't know if you fellas ever had a load of hay fall on you, but {{when they told me}} what {{happened}} yesterday, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me." ...|$|E
500|$|Celebrity Marilyn Monroe is {{mentioned}} numerous times throughout the song, including the famous quote [...] "I'm selfish, impatient {{and a little}} insecure. I make mistakes, I am {{out of control and}} at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best." [...] However, it has never been confirmed that Monroe actually said this. Minaj liked the track, as [...] "it spoke to me as a woman. I'm very infatuated with Marilyn Monroe. I had a moment with that song where I was like, 'Oh my God, every woman in this world needs to hear that'. No, we're not perfect. Sometimes, we think, 'What's wrong with us?' We spend so much time criticizing ourselves. I needed to hear that, 'I'm not perfect, but I'm worth it'. It resonated with me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> world needed to hear it." ...|$|E
500|$|Hankinson wrote, [...] "I enjoyed all {{the smaller}} numbers tonight because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> kids really sold the {{performances}} and infused some nice emotional context." [...] Of these, [...] "Never Going Back Again" [...] {{received the most}} consistent approval. Futterman said it was [...] "better than Artie's post-Tina 'Stronger, and Kubicek declared it [...] "proof that he's quite good at hitting emotional notes", while Semigran said she was [...] "blown away". Both Gonzalez and Benigno gave it an [...] "A−", while Berk gave it all five stars. Berk also gave five stars to [...] "Songbird", which Gonzalez again gave an [...] "A−", while Benigno was slightly less generous with a [...] "B+". Futterman described Santana's vocals as [...] "raw and restrained", and called her rendition of the song a [...] "heartbreaking performance", but while Semigran called it [...] "sweet enough", she also wrote [...] "Rivera's voice doesn't pack quite the punch the tune requires". Kubicek, however, said it was [...] "easily the best song from the episode".|$|E
5000|$|The unusual beat {{was created}} by Swizz Beatz while having fun and felt to make a song. The warping effect was from Crazy Town's Hollywood Babylon. He recalled: [...] "I did <b>the</b> beat because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> making <b>the</b> beat." ...|$|R
60|$|At last I {{was alone}} with Gladys, and the moment of Fate had come! All that evening <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> soldier who awaits the signal which will send him on a forlorn hope; hope of victory and fear of repulse {{alternating}} in his mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing very remarkable; I'd several motives. For one thing, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> I'd <b>like</b> <b>the</b> trip--had {{a stroke}} of luck not long ago which {{justified}} the expense. British Columbia's nowadays almost as accessible as parts of Norway, where I've generally gone to, and I understand it's wilder." ...|$|R
500|$|The episode {{helped to}} solidify the {{different}} personalities of The Lone Gunmen. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz explained, [...] "Up , they {{were sort of}} interchangeable in the information they delivered. But then Vince, who loved the characters and really wanted a chance to dig more deeply into them, created a back story and they became a lot more interesting." [...] Actor Dean Haglund, who played Langly, said of the episode, [...] "What we read in the script wasn't really our origins as we'd imagined it. I'd thought we were all in a university garage band together or something. Bruce [...] thought he was a photocopier repair man." [...] Much of the episode's action focused on Byers, played by Bruce Harwood. This experience was different for him, and he noted, [...] "I don't think I'd ever done an episode where I was the lead character. But <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> lead because it was my story about falling in love with this woman and then dragging these other two schmucks into the disaster that followed." [...] Vince Gilligan was particularly happy with his characterization of Byers, later admitting, [...] "I just loved the idea of Byers working for the government and being this very gung-ho pro-government guy. That's just a fundamental drama where you take a character on a journey and the journey take him 180 degrees from who he original was." ...|$|E
500|$|When Andy Schatz {{pitched the}} game to Microsoft Game Studios, it was turned down. Schatz responded saying [...] "they were crazy" [...] {{and asked if he}} could repitch the game; they agreed to let him do so. He {{continued}} to work on Monaco for roughly a year in order [...] "to make it something really marketable". When he pitched it to Microsoft Game Studios for the second time, it was turned down. After these events, Schatz got the impression that the game {{was not going to be}} released on the Xbox 360. [...] "That really bummed me out", Schatz said in an interview with Mike Rose from Gamasutra, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Xbox was the ideal platform for this particular game, because of the prevalence of headsets, the marketplace being strong, and the Xbox being the easiest console to work with. And of course the game was written in XNA, so it was a no-brainer". [...] Empty Clip Studios was brought onto the project in order to port {{the game to}} the RapidFire engine, so that the game could be release on the PlayStation 3, but the port was never finished. In order to publish the game on Xbox Live, Schatz partnered with video game publishing company Majesco Entertainment. As a result, the game had to be ported from Empty Clip to the RapidFire engine. Valve Corporation approached Schatz and offered to get the game on the Steam store distribution platform.|$|E
2500|$|Following Adams' speech, {{attendees}} {{created the}} first pile of small bicycles. One participant, {{who was one of}} the first women of Zoobomb, said about the creation of the first new pile: [...] "I pushed through the crowd and handed it forth, bowing in honor of the golden b(eye)cycle winking in the sun. As I retreated to the crowd, my whole body was shaking. My hands were in disbelief. I paced in a circle and half-sigh/half-laughed and this darn smile was holding me so tight, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> kiln was burning it into my clay, smile-shaped cheeks forever." [...] A long chain was wrapped through each of the nearly twenty bicycles, which were locked to the sculpture by Adams. Event attendees then posed for a group picture, then sang a song called [...] "16" [...] Rims", a parody of Janis Joplin's [...] "Mercedez Benz". The commemoration ended with [...] "dancing in the streets" [...] and music by The Sprockettes.|$|E

5000|$|Ron Perlman {{was offered}} two {{different}} {{roles in the}} film, but accepted {{the role of a}} transsexual character. He is quoted as saying [...] "They offered me two different roles and I went for <b>the</b> transsexual because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> when <b>the</b> door opens and you see that it's me, it should get a 'Yuck!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I {{went through}} {{yesterday}} must have hardened me, I suppose. At any rate, after reading <b>the</b> letter, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> more <b>like</b> <b>the</b> woman <b>I</b> once was than <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> for months past.

2500|$|On July 1, 2008, Redden {{signed a}} six-year, $39 million {{contract}} as an unrestricted free agent with the New York Rangers. Redden's performance continued to decline in New York, where he faced considerable criticism — one {{writer for the}} New York Post even called the contract [...] "the worst {{in the history of}} the NHL, if not in the history of hard-cap pro sports." [...] On September 25, 2010, the Rangers placed Redden on waivers in part due to the defenceman's declining play. The move also allowed the Rangers to fit under salary cap. Speaking in 2013 on his stint with the Rangers, Redden said, [...] "I think maybe making that money there and being the player I am… <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> first little while, things were going pretty good, and then they kind of fell off. I felt like I wasn’t doing enough, and like I should have been doing more. Once I started feeling that way, I think I just got away from the things that made me successful. Things just kind of snowballed from there." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 49ers had an 8–8 {{season in}} 2014 {{and failed to}} reach {{the playoffs for the}} first time under the Harbaugh era. On October 5, 2014 it was rumored that Harbaugh would not return in 2015 {{regardless}} of that season's outcome, though owner Jed York denied the claims at the time. It has been suggested that Harbaugh, despite his success on the field, was involved in a power struggle with 49ers general manager Trent Baalke starting from the 2013 season onward. On December 28, 2014, the 49ers announced that they had mutually agreed to part ways with Harbaugh as their head coach. [...] Owner Jed York claims Harbaugh and the 49ers agreed to mutually part ways immediately after a win over the Arizona Cardinals in the final week of the regular season. Harbaugh, however, later claimed [...] "I didn't leave the 49ers. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> 49er hierarchy left me." [...] Harbaugh further added that the 49ers informed him that he would no longer be the 49ers coach after suffering a loss on December 14, 2014, but that he decided to remain as the team's head coach for the final two games of the 2014 season because, [...] "I wanted to finish what I started–what we started." ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry Rollins, in {{his journal}} {{collection}} Get in the Van, notes that Pettibon's artwork became synonymous with Black Flag and that before Rollins joined the band he would collect photocopies of their flyers that had circulated from California to Washington, D.C. The album cover for Nervous Breakdown had a particularly strong impact on Rollins: [...] "The record's cover art said it all. A man {{with his back to}} the wall baring his fists. In front of him another man fending him off with a chair. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> guy with his fists up every day of my life." [...] Another image which drew considerable attention was the artwork created for the [...] "Police Story" [...] single, showing a police officer being held with a gun in his mouth with the speech blurb [...] "Make me come, faggot!" [...] The image was plastered on flyers all around Los Angeles and added to the police pressure on the band. Pettibon later remarked that [...] "my values are relativistic, and I'll give a cop the benefit of the doubt. If that's me with my gat – my gat's larger than the one depicted – we can have a discussion, and he can answer me just as well with my [...]357 barrel in his mouth, or on his cheek, or on his adenoids, or down his throat. I'll listen to his whimpering cries." ...|$|E

60|$|Then it did {{actually}} {{begin to}} rain. I {{was just going}} down a short hill. So I sat under a bush and watched the trees drip.

It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one summer evening on this very spot--how desolate, and hopeless, and objectless! It stopped as I beckoned.
