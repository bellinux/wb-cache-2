5|$|From 1920 John Carson, {{also working}} for AT, {{began to develop}} a new way of looking at signals using the {{operational}} calculus of Heaviside which in essence is working in the frequency domain. This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel to invent many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished many of the old ideas. For instance the old telegraph engineers thought of the signal as being a single frequency and this idea persisted into the age of radio with some still believing that <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>FM)</b> transmission could be achieved with a smaller bandwidth than the baseband signal right up until the publication of Carson's 1922 paper. Another advance concerned the nature of noise, Carson and Zobel (1923) treated noise as a random process with a continuous bandwidth, an idea that was well ahead of its time, and thus limited the amount of noise {{that it was possible to}} remove by filtering to that part of the noise spectrum which fell outside the passband. This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with wide-band FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry Nyquist whose thermal noise power formula is well known today.|$|E

These calls are mixed with brief <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> (<b>FM),</b> and are harmonic, consisting of a second, more intense constant frequency of about 61 kHz. The bats use the long CF portion to evaluate relative motion, and the terminal downward FM to determine target distance. Parnell's mustached bat has {{a wide variety of}} communication skills in addition to its advanced sonar. In mormoopids, P. parnellii is the only species of the group that has evolved Doppler-sensitive sonar due to the long CF call component.|$|R
5000|$|Varactors {{are used}} as voltage-controlled capacitors. They are {{commonly}} used in voltage-controlled oscillators, parametric amplifiers, and frequency multipliers. [...] Voltage-controlled oscillators have many applications such as <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> for <b>FM</b> transmitters and phase-locked loops. Phase-locked loops are used for the frequency synthesizers that tune many radios, television sets, and cellular telephones.|$|R
25|$|Amateur radio {{operators}} use various {{modes of}} transmission to communicate. The two most common modes for voice transmissions are <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>FM)</b> and single sideband (SSB). FM offers high quality audio signals, while SSB is better at long distance communication when bandwidth is restricted.|$|E
25|$|In telecommunications, <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>FM)</b> conveys {{information}} over {{a carrier}} wave by varying its frequency. While {{working in the}} basement laboratory of Columbia's Philosophy Hall, Edwin Armstrong invented wide-band frequency modulation radio in 1933. Rather than varying the amplitude of a radio wave to create sound, Armstrong's method varied {{the frequency of the}} wave instead. FM radio broadcasts delivered a much clearer sound, free of static, than the AM radio dominant at the time. Armstrong received a patent on wideband FM on December 26, 1933.|$|E
25|$|Many PLL {{frequency}} synthesizers {{can also}} generate <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>FM).</b> The modulating signal {{is added to}} the output of the loop filter, directly varying the frequency of the VCO and the synthesizer output. The modulation will also appear at the phase comparator output, reduced in amplitude by any frequency division. Any spectral components in the modulating signal too low to be blocked by the loop filter end up back at the VCO input with opposite polarity to the modulating signal, thus canceling them out. (The loop effectively sees these components as VCO noise to be tracked out.) Modulation components above the loop filter cutoff frequency cannot return to the VCO input so they remain in the VCO output.|$|E
40|$|Frequency Domain Linear Prediction (FDLP) {{represents}} an effi-cient technique for representing the long-term amplitude modula-tions (AM) of speech/audio signals using autoregressive models. For the proposed analysis technique, relatively long temporal seg-ments (1000 ms) of the input signal are decomposed into {{a set of}} sub-bands. FDLP is applied on each sub-band to model the tempo-ral envelopes. The residual of the linear prediction represents the <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> (<b>FM)</b> in the sub-band signal. In this paper, we present several applications of the proposed AM-FM decompo-sition technique {{for a variety of}} tasks like wide-band audio coding, speech recognition in reverberant environments and robust feature extraction for phoneme recognition.

40|$|When two tones are {{presented}} to the ear, distortion products are generated which are lower in frequency than the presented (primary) tones. We studied the responses of neurons from the inferior colliculus of the cat to small <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> (<b>FM)</b> of primary tone combinations which gave rise to distortion products within the neuron 2 ̆ 7 s response area. Neural discharges were modulated {{in response to the}} FM of the distortion product in a similar manner to modulation of discharges by FM of a pure tone to which these neurons were sensitive. However, very shallow, neurally-insignificant FM of high-frequency primaries could be transposed into significant FM of lower frequency distortion products. Because the sensitivity of a low-frequency neuron to a transposed FM exceeds that of neurons sensitive to a single tone with the same FM, the effect is termed hyperacuity...|$|R

The performance of this family of TFDs is compared to the most known quadratic distributions through tests on multi-component signals with linear and nonlinear <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> (<b>FMs)</b> considering the noise effects as well.

500|$|However, {{despite the}} pending switch to digital, analog {{television}} remains being transmitted in most countries. An {{exception is the}} United States that ended analog television transmission (by all but the very low-power TV stations) on 12 June 2009 after twice delaying the switchover deadline,Kenya also ended analog television transmission in December 2014 after multiple delays. For analog television, there are three standards in use for broadcasting color TV (see a map on adoption [...] ). These are known as PAL (German designed), NTSC (North American designed), and SECAM (French designed). (It {{is important to understand}} that these are the ways of sending color TV, and they do not {{have anything to do with}} the standards for black & white TV, which also vary from country to country.) For analog radio, the switch to digital radio is made more difficult by the fact that analog receivers are sold at a small fraction of the price of digital receivers. The choice of modulation for analog radio is typically between amplitude (AM) or <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>FM).</b> To achieve stereo playback, an amplitude modulated subcarrier is used for stereo FM.|$|E

2500|$|In {{telecommunications}} and signal processing, <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>FM)</b> is the {{encoding of information}} in a carrier wave by varying the instantaneous frequency of the wave. [...] This contrasts with amplitude modulation, in which the amplitude of the carrier wave varies, while the frequency remains constant.|$|E
25|$|In analog <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation,</b> such as <b>FM</b> radio {{broadcasting}} of an audio signal representing voice or music, the instantaneous frequency deviation, {{the difference between}} the frequency of the carrier and its center frequency, is proportional to the modulating signal.|$|R
25|$|A major {{advance for}} chip music was the {{introduction}} of <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> synthesis (<b>FM</b> synthesis), first commercially released by Yamaha for their digital synthesizers and FM sound chips, which began appearing in arcade machines from the early 1980s. Arcade game composers utilizing FM synthesis at the time included Konami's Miki Higashino (Gradius, Yie-Ar Kung Fu, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) and Sega's Hiroshi Kawaguchi (Space Harrier, Hang-On, Out Run).|$|R
2500|$|In 1975, the Japanese company Yamaha {{licensed}} the algorithms for <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> synthesis (<b>FM</b> synthesis) from John Chowning, who had {{experimented with}} it at Stanford University since 1971. Yamaha's engineers began adapting Chowning's algorithm {{for use in a}} digital synthesizer, adding improvements such as the [...] "key scaling" [...] method to avoid the introduction of distortion that normally occurred in analog systems during <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation.</b> However, the first commercial digital synthesizer to be released would be the Australian Fairlight company's Fairlight CMI (Computer Musical Instrument) in 1979, as the first practical polyphonic digital synthesizer/sampler system.|$|R
2500|$|A {{wide variety}} of Kalman filters have now been developed, from Kalman's {{original}} formulation, now called the [...] "simple" [...] Kalman filter, the Kalman–Bucy filter, Schmidt's [...] "extended" [...] filter, the information filter, {{and a variety of}} [...] "square-root" [...] filters that were developed by Bierman, Thornton and many others. Perhaps the most commonly used type of very simple Kalman filter is the phase-locked loop, which is now ubiquitous in radios, especially <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>FM)</b> radios, television sets, satellite communications receivers, outer space communications systems, and nearly any other electronic communications equipment.|$|E
2500|$|One {{disadvantage}} of all amplitude modulation techniques (not only standard AM) {{is that the}} receiver amplifies and detects noise and electromagnetic interference in equal proportion to the signal. Increasing the received signal-to-noise ratio, say, {{by a factor of}} 10 (a 10 decibel improvement), thus would require increasing the transmitter power by a factor of 10. This is in contrast to [...] <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>FM)</b> and digital radio where the effect of such noise following demodulation is strongly reduced so long as the received signal is well above the threshold for reception. For this reason AM broadcast is not favored for music and high fidelity broadcasting, but rather for voice communications and broadcasts (sports, news, talk radio etc.).|$|E
2500|$|The RF {{bandwidth}} of an AM transmission (refer to Figure 2, {{but only}} considering positive frequencies) is twice the bandwidth of the modulating (or [...] "baseband") signal, since {{the upper and}} lower sidebands around the carrier frequency each have a bandwidth as wide as the highest modulating frequency. Although the bandwidth of an AM signal is narrower than one using <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>FM),</b> it is twice as wide as single-sideband techniques; it thus may be viewed as spectrally inefficient. Within a frequency band, only half as many transmissions (or [...] "channels") can thus be accommodated. For this reason analog television employs a variant of single-sideband (known as vestigial sideband, somewhat of a compromise in terms of bandwidth) {{in order to reduce the}} required channel spacing.|$|E
50|$|Each {{species has}} a {{characteristic}} EOD baseline frequency range, which varies with sex and age within the species, as well. The baseline frequency is maintained {{to be almost}} constant at stable temperature, but will usually be changed due {{to the presence of}} others of the same species. Such changes in frequency relevant to social interaction are called <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> (<b>FMs).</b> The role these FMs have in communication is significant, as black ghost knifefish have developed jamming avoidance responses, which are behavioral responses that avoid the overlapping of EOD frequencies between conspecific individuals to prevent sensory confusion. Moreover, a study was conducted that focused on sexual dimorphism in electrocommunication signals. Female black ghost knifefish generate EODs at a higher frequency than the males, an FM which can be used for gender recognition. A study found the subdominant black ghost knifefish exhibited noticeable gradual frequency rises (GFRs) in their EODs whereas the dominant fish did not, supporting the researchers' hypothesis that GFRs during communication are indicative of submissive signals.|$|R

A similar processing cannot be incorporated in the cochlear implant as it would result in spectral mismatch. The current study evaluated the effect of such mismatch on speech recognition scores. Method: The study involved the subjects with normal hearing who listened to the spectrally shifted HINT sentences having only amplitude modulation (AM) cues and amplitude <b>modulation</b> with <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> (<b>FM).</b> Sine wave vocoders were used to synthesize the signals with only AM and AM with FM cues.

We sought to determine the relative contributions of orientation <b>modulations</b> (OMs) and <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> (<b>FMs)</b> for the detection of slant and shape from 3 -D surfaces. Results show that 1) when OM and FM indicate inconsistent degrees of surface slant or curvature, observer responses were consistent with the slant or curvature specified by OM even if the FM indicated a slant or curvature in the opposite direction to the same degree. 2) For slanted surfaces, OM information dictates slant perception at both shallow and steep slants while FM information is effective only for steep slants. Together these results point to a dominant role of OM information in the perception of 3 -D slant and shape...|$|R

50|$|<b>Frequency</b> <b>{{modulation}}</b> or <b>FM</b> {{is a form}} of modulation which conveys {{information by}} varying the frequency of a carrier wave; the older amplitude modulation or AM varies the amplitude of the carrier, with its frequency remaining constant. With FM, frequency deviation from the assigned carrier frequency at any instant is directly proportional to the amplitude of the input signal, determining the instantaneous frequency of the transmitted signal. Because transmitted FM signals use more bandwidth than AM signals, this form of modulation is commonly used with the higher (VHF or UHF) frequencies used by TV, the FM broadcast band, and land mobile radio systems.|$|R
