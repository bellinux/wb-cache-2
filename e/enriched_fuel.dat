25|$|Under 1% of {{the uranium}} {{found in nature}} is the easily {{fissionable}} U-235 isotope {{and as a result}} most reactor designs require <b>enriched</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Light water (the {{ordinary}} H2O) is both {{a neutron}} moderator and a neutron absorber. This means that not only can it slow down neutrons to velocities in equilibrium with surrounding molecules ("thermalize" [...] them {{and turn them into}} low-energy neutrons that {{are far more likely to}} interact with the uranium-235 nuclei than the fast neutrons produced by fission initially), but it can also absorb some of them outright. Heavy water is also a good neutron moderator, but is expensive to produce and does not absorb neutrons as easily, so the use of <b>enriched</b> <b>fuel</b> is not required to produce a meaningful power output.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 May 2010 Iran, Brazil, and Turkey {{issued a}} joint {{declaration}} [...] "in which Iran agreed to send low-enriched uranium to Turkey {{in return for}} <b>enriched</b> <b>fuel</b> for a research reactor." [...] Iran reported the joint declaration to the IAEA on 24 May 2010, asking it to inform the [...] "Vienna Group" [...] (the United States, Russia, France, and the IAEA), in order to conclude a written agreement and make contingent arrangements between Iran and the Vienna Group. The proposal was welcomed by Arab leaders and China. France's Prime Minister called the agreement a [...] "positive step" [...] toward resolving the Iran nuclear program dispute, if Iran were to cease uranium enrichment altogether. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton played down the agreement, saying it was {{a step in the}} right direction but did not go far enough and left questions unanswered. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the proposal had [...] "a number of deficiencies," [...] including Iran's intention to continue enriching uranium to high levels.|$|E
25|$|Natural uranium is only 0.7% uranium-235, the isotope {{necessary}} for thermal reactors. This makes {{it necessary to}} <b>enrich</b> the uranium <b>fuel,</b> which significantly increases the costs of fuel production. The requirement to <b>enrich</b> <b>fuel</b> for PWRs also presents a serious proliferation risk.|$|R

50|$|As {{a result}} of {{concerns}} that this plutonium would support weapons development, former IAEA Deputy Director-General for Safeguards, Olli Heinonen, proposed a reactor redesign to a reactor using slightly <b>enriched</b> uranium <b>fuel</b> rather than natural uranium. Use of <b>enriched</b> uranium <b>fuel</b> combined with extended operations would reduce the reactor's ability to produce weapons-grade plutonium.|$|R
50|$|For use in {{reactors}} such as CANDU {{which do}} not require <b>enriched</b> <b>fuel,</b> the U3O8 may instead be converted to uranium dioxide (UO2) which can be included in ceramic fuel elements.|$|E
50|$|The TOPAZ {{nuclear reactor}} is a {{lightweight}} nuclear reactor developed for long term space {{use by the}} Soviet Union. Cooled by liquid metal, it uses a high-temperature moderator containing hydrogen and highly <b>enriched</b> <b>fuel</b> and produces electricity using a thermionic converter.|$|E
50|$|The fuel in a {{seagoing}} reactor {{is typically}} more highly enriched (i.e., contains a higher concentration of 235U vs. 238U) than that {{used in a}} land-based nuclear power plant. Some marine reactors run on relatively low-enriched uranium which requires more frequent refueling. Others run on highly enriched uranium, varying from 20% 235U, to the over 96% 235U found in U.S. submarines, in which the resulting smaller core is quieter in operation (a big advantage to a submarine). Using more-highly <b>enriched</b> <b>fuel</b> also increases the reactor's power density and extends the usable life of the nuclear fuel load, but is more expensive and a greater risk to nuclear proliferation than less-highly <b>enriched</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to develop systems that will allow for increased nuclear energy production {{through the use of}} <b>enriched</b> <b>fuels.</b> The developed systems will allow for the efficient and selective recover of selected isotopes that are additives to power water reactors' primary coolant chemistry for suppression of corrosion attack on reactor materials...|$|R

50|$|Designed for 40 {{years of}} reactor life, Arktika will require {{refuelling}} every seven years {{with less than}} 20% uranium-235 <b>enriched</b> <b>fuel.</b> The new icebreaker is able to navigate through ice up to almost three meters thick. The cost of one RITM-200 reactor is 8 billion rubles (US$ billion).|$|E
50|$|Nuclear weapons employ high quality, highly <b>enriched</b> <b>fuel</b> {{exceeding}} the critical size and geometry (critical mass) {{necessary in order}} to obtain an explosive chain reaction. The fuel for energy purposes, such as in a nuclear fission reactor, is very different, usually consisting of a low-enriched oxide material (e.g. UO2).|$|E

50|$|In 1973 Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Toyota, and Volkswagen had {{to remove}} ambient {{temperature}} switches which affected emissions, though the companies denied intentional cheating {{and said that}} strategies like <b>enriching</b> <b>fuel</b> mixture during cold engine warm-up periods could reduce overall pollution. The switches were ordered removed from production but cars already on the road {{did not have to}} be recalled, and fines were relatively modest.|$|R
5000|$|A {{nuclear fuel}} bank is reserve of {{low enriched uranium}} (LEU) for {{countries}} that need a backup source of LEU to fuel their nuclear reactors. Countries that do have enrichment technology would donate <b>enriched</b> <b>fuel</b> to a [...] "bank", from which countries not possessing enrichment technology would obtain fuel for their power reactors.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} small size, low weight, low {{vibration}} and high power to weight ratio, Wankel rotary engines {{are used in}} many large UAVs. Their engine rotors cannot seize; the engine is not susceptible to shock-cooling during descent {{and it does not}} require an <b>enriched</b> <b>fuel</b> mixture for cooling at high power. These attributes reduce fuel usage, increasing range or payload.|$|E
50|$|Filippone {{maintains}} that when steam {{is used as}} the moderator, the average neutron energy is increased {{from that of a}} liquid water-moderated reactor such that the delayed neutrons persist until they hit another nucleus. The resulting extremely high neutron economy, he claims, will make it possible to maintain a self-sustaining reaction in fuel rods of pure , once the reactor has been started by <b>enriched</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the Sodium Reactor Experiment was to {{demonstrate}} the feasibility of a sodium-cooled reactor as the heat source for a commercial power reactor to produce electricity. A secondary objective was to obtain operational data on slightly <b>enriched</b> <b>fuel</b> and uranium-thorium fuel mixtures. The reactor {{was designed as a}} flexible development facility, and was considered a development tool emphasizing the investigation of fuel materials.|$|E
50|$|Some nuclear {{reactors}} use heavy water as cooling. Heavy water is employed in {{nuclear reactors}} {{because it is}} a weaker neutron absorber. This allows for the use of less <b>enriched</b> <b>fuel.</b> For the main cooling system, normal water is preferably employed {{through the use of a}} heat exchanger, as heavy water is much more expensive. Reactors that use other materials for moderation (graphite) may also use normal water for cooling.|$|E
5000|$|The reactor was a swimming-pool type reactor, {{originally}} {{operating at}} 1 MW using 93% enriched U-235 aluminum-based fuel.

50|$|Although it {{had been}} {{predicted}} to produce a yield of 6 to 10 megatons, it actually produced a yield of 13.5 megatons, the second-largest ever yield in a U.S. fusion weapon test. Like the Mike, Bravo and Romeo tests, {{a large percentage of}} the yield was produced by fast fission of the natural uranium tamper. Of the total yield, 7 megatons were from fission; the other 6.5 megatons were from fusion reactions. The high fusion yield was due to the <b>enriched</b> <b>fuel</b> and set a U.S. record that stood until Hardtack Poplar in 1958.|$|E
50|$|Such {{a design}} has three major {{advantages}} over conventional military designs; the entire reaction cycle occurs much faster so it breeds new fuel {{at a faster}} rate, it can use {{a wider variety of}} breeding materials because it is not used as the fuel as well, and it also generates ample amounts of heat, which can be used to efficiently produce power. The downside is {{that it has to be}} fueled with some sort of <b>enriched</b> <b>fuel,</b> although the fissile material being bred in the blanket can be used.|$|E
5000|$|The MNSR is tank-in-pool type, {{with highly}} <b>enriched</b> <b>fuel</b> (~ 90% U235 [...] ). The tank is {{immersed}} in a large pool, and the core is, in turn, immersed in the tank.
