5|$|The initial {{idea for}} the game was {{inspired}} by , a 2007 video game which members of both companies were playing at the time. The game was proposed to Square Enix <b>half-jokingly</b> by PopCap's chief creative officer Jason Kapalka during a meeting between the two companies in 2007, and was released on the Xbox Live Arcade and on the Steam platform for Windows PCs by Square Enix on November 18, 2009. Gyromancer received a generally positive reception from reviewers. Critics took issue with perceived limited graphics, {{some aspects of the}} music, and a weak and confusing plot. Despite these flaws, in general they found the game to be fun and addictive, and to {{have a great deal of}} replay value.|$|E
25|$|There was {{an awkward}} moment when Jon Bon Jovi was being interviewed for an {{unrelated}} topic. At {{the end of the}} interview Jon Bon Jovi <b>half-jokingly</b> remarked that they needed a new theme song and that he would write and record them a new one.|$|E
25|$|Emoviolence is a stylistic {{fusion of}} screamo and powerviolence. The name was coined <b>half-jokingly</b> by In/Humanity. Recognizable {{elements}} of emoviolence are its incorporation of amplified feedback and blast beats; {{the music is}} highly dissonant and chaotic, generally featuring fast tempos, shouting, and screamed vocals. Emoviolence practitioners include Pg. 99, Orchid, Reversal Of Man, Usurp Synapse, RentAmerica, and In/Humanity.|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{points out}} that, {{although}} it was said <b>half-jokingly,</b> so far as Shankly was concerned there was a degree of truth in what he had said. Shankly had fully realised the importance of football to its die-hard fans, himself included. It had become [...] "too important". Ian St John agreed that [...] "much of Shankly's behaviour was bizarre", but everything was done with a purpose because [...] "Shankly always {{knew what he was}} doing and what he was saying".|$|E
500|$|In October 1982, Gibson {{traveled}} to Austin, Texas for ArmadilloCon, {{at which he}} appeared with Shirley, Sterling and Shiner on a panel called [...] "Behind the Mirrorshades: A Look at Punk SF", where Shiner noted [...] "the sense of a movement solidified". After a weekend discussing rock and roll, MTV, Japan, fashion, drugs and politics, Gibson left the cadre for Vancouver, declaring <b>half-jokingly</b> that [...] "a new axis has been formed." [...] Sterling, Shiner, Shirley and Gibson, along with Rudy Rucker, went on to form {{the core of the}} radical cyberpunk literary movement.|$|E
500|$|Belldandy is {{introduced}} to the series when Keiichi Morisato, portrayed as a typical college student with a notable lack of experience with women, accidentally dials the [...] "Goddess Relief Agency" [...] when attempting to order take-away noodles (the reason is simply explained as fate in the manga and anime adaptations). Belldandy appears before Keiichi and offers to grant him a wish. Convinced that the whole incident is a prank played on him by his seniors (Senpais), Keiichi <b>half-jokingly</b> wishes her {{to stay with him}} forever. ("I want a goddess like you to be by my side forever"). The wish, of course, is granted—thus providing one of the key premises of the series.|$|E
500|$|Some minutes later, {{having already}} {{captured}} his second consecutive Ski Jumping World Cup title, Janne Ahonen went for broke {{when he caught}} a massive thermal updraft and stretched out a jump of , only to fall from a dangerous height and slam down hard onto flat ground; his world record was rendered unofficial. MTV3 commentator Jani Uotila called it [...] "A horrendous jump! This is all getting too dangerous now!", while co-commentator Nieminen explained that [...] "When one comes down on flat ground, the impact is really hard." [...] Ahonen <b>half-jokingly</b> said in a 2009 interview that had he not brought his jump down earlier than intended, from the height at which he was still flying, he would have reached : [...] "I would be a dead man. [...] " ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{the episode}} was released, Debbie Liebling, then-Comedy Central vice {{president}} of development and production, herself described the episode as [...] "adorably offensive". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger called the episode [...] "a brilliant skewering" [...] of political correctness and over-sensitivity, and called it [...] "at once hilariously satiric and extraordinarily foul." [...] Sepinwall also added Mr. Hankey to his 1997 list of most memorable TV moments, describing the character as the year's [...] "most disturbing cartoon image" [...] and as [...] "a mythical holiday creature so bizarre and offensive it literally cannot be described in a family newspaper". Matt Roush of USA Today praised the episode, which he described as [...] "ribald, raunchy and riotous". A.J. Jacobs of Entertainment Weekly said in January 1998 that the episode was [...] "already infamous". Jacobs also said Mr. Hankey was so popular, he <b>half-jokingly</b> suggested Matt Parker and Trey Stone pursue a spin-off revolving around the character.|$|E
500|$|Just before Dwight {{starts his}} fire simulation, {{he said his}} {{co-workers}} previously failed to listen because he made a presentation on the computer program Microsoft PowerPoint, of which he said, [...] "PowerPoint is boring". Michael refers to Barack Obama, the first African American president of the United States, to Stanley while he is suffering a heart attack by shouting, [...] "Stanley! Barack is president! You are black! Stanley!" [...] A deleted scene further addresses Obama's election, with Michael praising the choice and Darryl, with Darryl <b>half-jokingly</b> telling the Caucasian office workers what will change for them (they {{no longer have to}} pretend to like jazz, and Morgan Freeman won't get any more acting work because [...] "he's more for you guys"). Michael calls an employee from the Red Cross, an international humanitarian movement, to conduct a lesson about CPR. The instructor suggests they pump the heart to the tune of [...] "Stayin' Alive", a disco song by the pop band, the Bee Gees, but Michael mixes the song up with [...] "I Will Survive" [...] by Gloria Gaynor. At the end of the lesson, Dwight cuts the face off the CPR dummy and places it on his face in the manner of Hannibal Lecter, a fictional cannibalistic serial killer who cut the face off a man and wore it as a mask in the 1991 thriller film, The Silence of the Lambs. Watching Mrs. Albert Hannaday, Andy says the Cloris Leachman character was originally supposed to be played by the much younger actress, Nicole Kidman, and the last-minute replacement prompted a minor overhaul in the film's script. The songs [...] "You Make My Dreams Come True" [...] by Hall and Oates, [...] "All Out of Love" [...] by the soft rock duo Air Supply, [...] "Have a Little Faith in Me" [...] by singer-songwriter John Hiatt, and [...] "Lady" [...] by Little River Band play during scenes in Mrs. Albert Hannaday.|$|E

2500|$|Murray has {{described}} himself, perhaps <b>half-jokingly,</b> {{as the last}} of the Jindyworobaks, an Australian literary movement whose white members sought to promote indigenous Australian ideas and customs, particularly in poetry. [...] Though not a member, he was influenced by their work, something that is frequently discussed by Murray critics and scholars in relation to his themes and sensibilities.|$|E
2500|$|The {{real problem}} with {{downtown}} lately, Gronk and his friends <b>half-jokingly</b> agreed is 'those people.' [...] Westsiders. [...] Trust-fund babies. [...] New tenants who demand their bohemian pleasures be liberally sweetened with suburban amenities. [...] Landlords who previously recruited artists to help make downtown 'safe' for gentrification, then jacked up their rents so only lawyers and screenwriters could afford it.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010 {{he stated}} that [...] "twenty or thirty years ago", when {{discussing}} whether a woman could be a Dalai Lama in the future, he said yes but [...] "I also said <b>half-jokingly</b> that if the Dalai Lama's reincarnation is female, she must be very attractive. The reason is so that she will have more influence on others. If she is an ugly female, she won’t be very effective, will she?" ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{sensitive}} boy, Marko has {{a talent}} for composing poetry; a character <b>half-jokingly</b> refers to him as [...] "Kočo Racin II". A Bosnian teacher of Macedonian (Mustafa Nadarevic) becomes Marko's mentor. He encourages Marko {{to take part in}} a French-sponsored poetry contest whose winners will represent Macedonia in Paris, as well as to recite his entry during their school's upcoming Independence Day celebrations. He fills Marko with hopes of escaping his hometown through literary achievement to Paris, the [...] "city of art".|$|E
2500|$|NCAA {{rules in}} the 1960s forbade college freshmen from {{participating}} in varsity sports competition. Spurrier therefore spent {{his first year at}} Florida practicing with the varsity team and playing on the freshman team, which scheduled four scrimmages against other schools' freshman squads as a way for young players to gain experience. In 1963, Spurrier led the [...] "Baby Gators" [...] to a 45-12 victory over Georgia's freshman team at Florida Field, a game which he <b>half-jokingly</b> claimed as a home win years later.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{has worked}} with his former bandmates on various {{occasions}} since leaving the Rolling Stones. In 1977 he attended London-based sessions for the John Phillips album Pay Pack & Follow, appearing on several tracks alongside Jagger (vocals), Richards (guitar) and Wood (bass) – taking notable solos on the songs [...] "Oh Virginia" [...] and [...] "Zulu Warrior". A possibly apocryphal story is that after Taylor played a particularly jaw-dropping solo in the studio, Richards <b>half-jokingly</b> exclaimed, [...] "That's why I never liked you, you bastard!" ...|$|E
2500|$|While there, they trained military, industrial, and {{university}} {{personnel in the}} intricacies of rockets and guided missiles. As part of the Hermes project, they helped refurbish, assemble, and launch a number of V-2s that had been shipped from Germany to the White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico. They also continued to study the future potential of rockets for military and research applications. Since they were not permitted to leave Fort Bliss without military escort, von Braun and his colleagues began to refer to themselves only <b>half-jokingly</b> as [...] "PoPs" [...] – [...] "Prisoners of Peace".|$|E
2500|$|Leading Australian poet Les Murray has sympathised {{with the}} Jindyworobaks' aims, and <b>half-jokingly</b> {{described}} himself as [...] "the last of the Jindyworobaks". The attitude to Australia presented in Eleanor Dark's 1941 novel The Timeless Land {{has been described as}} very {{similar to that of the}} Jindyworobaks. The movement's lingering influence has also been identified in the poetry of Peter Porter, as well as Patrick White's Voss (1957) and Randolph Stow's To the Islands (1958). In Australian cinema, director Charles Chauvel's vision of Australia, presented in films such as Jedda (1955), has been compared to that of the Jindyworobaks.|$|E
2500|$|Similar low-voiced singing can {{be heard}} from the jazz vocalist Jimmy Scott, whose range matches {{approximately}} that used by female blues singers, while the Turkish popular singer Cem Adrian {{has the ability to}} sing from bass to soprano, his vocal folds having been reported to be three times the average length. Actor Chris Colfer has a mezzosoprano range. Colfer has stated in interviews that when his voice began to change at puberty he sang in a high voice [...] "constantly" [...] in an effort to retain his range. The late musician Jeff Buckley had a four-octave range, which allowed him to cover women's songs in a natural voice and reach notes from bass to soprano. Voice actor Walter Tetley {{may or may not have}} been a castrato; Bill Scott, a co-worker of Tetley's during their later work in television, once <b>half-jokingly</b> quipped that Tetley's mother [...] "had him fixed" [...] to protect the child star's voice-acting career. Tetley never personally divulged the exact reason for his condition, which left him with the voice of a preteen boy for his entire adult life.|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} few moments the young man tried to find relief in furious riding, and in {{bullying}} his spirited horse. Then he pulled quickly up. What was he doing? What {{was he going to}} do? What foolish, vapid deceit was this {{that he was going to}} practice upon that noble, queenly, confiding, generous woman? (He had already forgotten that she had always distrusted him.) What a fool he was not to tell her <b>half-jokingly</b> that he expected to meet Susy! But would he have dared to talk <b>half-jokingly</b> to such a woman on such a topic? And would it have been honorable without disclosing the WHOLE truth,--that they had met secretly before? And was it fair to Susy?--dear, innocent, childish Susy! Yet something must be done! It was such trivial, purposeless deceit, after all; for this noble woman, Mrs. Peyton, so kind, so gentle, would never object to his loving Susy and marrying her. And they would all live happily together; and Mrs. Peyton would never be separated from them, but always beaming tenderly upon them as she did just now in the garden. Yes, he would have a serious understanding with Susy, and that would excuse the clandestine meeting to-day.|$|E

5000|$|Seven days later, Files had a {{first draft}} of a {{full-length}} book. She didn't take what she'd written seriously. She <b>half-jokingly</b> sent the manuscript to her agent with the note, [...] "I don't know what this is. It just popped out." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{face and}} torso of Hermes are {{striking}} for their highly polished, glowing surface, which John Boardman <b>half-jokingly</b> attributed to generations of female temple workers.

5000|$|Dr. Joy {{was also}} known for her advice to act [...] "stupid and cheerful" [...] when dealing with {{difficult}} people.
