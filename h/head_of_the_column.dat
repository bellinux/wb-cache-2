5|$|At about 2:00 pm the French {{attacked}} Castel Ceriolo {{and delayed}} {{the advance of}} Schellenberg’s column by attacking its tail. Aided by Frimont, Ott defeated Monnier and forced two-thirds of his command to retreat to the northeast. About the same time, Marengo had fallen to the Austrians, forcing Napoleon's men into a general retreat. As Austrian troops crossed the Fontanone, their guns bombarded the French infantry in the vines. In a bid to further delay Schellenberg’s advance, Bonaparte committed his main Guard battalion and its artillery, which moved to flank the column. After driving off Austrian dragoons {{with the aid of}} GdB Champeaux’s remaining cavalry (under Joachim Murat), they engaged the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column.</b> After a 15-minute firefight around 4:00 pm the Guard were surprised and destroyed by Frimont’s cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Within a few hours, {{a second}} column of {{infantry}} assaulted the town from the northwest. Five or six tanks at the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column</b> infiltrated Chonan and began destroying all vehicles in sight, {{as well as}} any buildings suspected of harboring Americans. Around 0600, infantry from the northwest column began flooding into the city and engaged in an intense and confused battle with the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry Regiment in the streets of Chonan. 3rd Battalion managed to destroy two of the tanks with rockets and grenades, but the column was able to cut off two companies of the 3rd Battalion {{from the rest of the}} force. Around 0800, Martin was killed by a North Korean tank when he fired a 2.36-inch bazooka at a North Korean T-34 tank at the same time it fired its main cannon at the building he was in. He had been in command of the 34th Infantry Regiment for only 14 hours. The tank was undamaged by Martin's shot, as the weapon was obsolete and could not penetrate T-34 armor.|$|E
25|$|A road bend was {{included}} in the kill zone so {{that the end of the}} column was out of sight of the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column</b> when the ambush was sprung. Interruption of a column's front-to-rear line of sight increased the likelihood that the head and tail of the column would split and try to fight separately.|$|E
60|$|The doors soon {{gave way}} to the attacks upon them, and the assailants rushed in, in a crowd.

25|$|On 22 November, the Central Intelligence Agency flew in five five-man {{commando}} {{teams from}} the Thai Police Aerial Reinforcement Unit (PARU). Each team contained two officers, a medic, and two radiomen. PARU Teams A and B would join the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column.</b> Teams D and E would trail the movement. Team C would flank the movement to the east, at Khamkeut. They supplied added communication and control capability to the column, and advised on ways to circumvent any opposing strongpoints.|$|E
25|$|Rüstow and Köchly, {{writing in}} the 19th century, {{believed}} that Pelopidas led the Sacred Band out from the column to attack the Spartans in the flank. Hans Delbrück considered {{this to be a}} mere misreading of Plutarch. Plutarch does indeed describe Pelopidas leading the Band and catching the Spartans in disorder, but there is nothing in his account that conveys anything other than the Sacred Band being the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column,</b> and the Spartans were disordered not because they were taken in the flank but because they were caught in mid-maneuver, extending their line.|$|E
25|$|While Imboden's wagons moved northwest, Lee {{designated}} a shorter route for his three corps: southwest through Fairfield and over Monterey Pass to Hagerstown. After dark on July 4, Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's Third Corps headed {{out onto the}} Fairfield Road, followed by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's First Corps and Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's Second Corps. Lee accompanied Hill at the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column.</b> Departing in the dark, Lee {{had the advantage of}} getting several hours head start and the route from {{the west side of the}} battlefield to Williamsport was about half as long as the ones available to the Army of the Potomac.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two types}} of guidons used by the Corps of Cadets at the United States Military Academy. “Dress” guidons are {{horizontally}} divided, golden yellow over silver gray, with the letters “USCC” centered between the regimental number on the upper stripe and the company letter on the lower stripe. “Field” guidons have the regimental number only. All letters and numerals are black. Initial entry training platoons carry colored guidons to signify what phase of training they have attained. The guidon bearer normally stands with the platoon guide when stationary and marches at the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column.</b> Although IET guidons may have streamers attached, they are typically undecorated.|$|E
25|$|The battlecruisers {{were ordered}} to take {{positions}} at the rear behind II Squadron, because of their severe battle damage. Admiral Hipper {{had been forced to}} leave his flagship SMS Lützow and had some trouble boarding another ship {{in the course of the}} battle. At 2115 he boarded SMS Moltke and again assumed command, initially mistakenly ordering the ships to move to the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column.</b> Only SMS Seydlitz and Moltke could immediately comply: SMS Derfflinger had too many holes to travel at speed, and SMS Von der Tann needed to clean ash from her boilers forcing her to steam slowly. When Derfflinger and Von der Tann drew abreast of the flagship SMS Friedrich der Grosse, Scheer once again ordered them to the rear. The two joined the end of the German column, but Seydlitz and Moltke remained out of position initially ahead of the fleet and had to move independently through the British fleet. Lützow proceeded southwards behind the fleet for the first couple of hours of the night at the best speed she could manage, seven knots, but eventually sank at 0145.|$|E
60|$|Before, {{however, the}} straggling troops could be {{collected}} it was eight o'clock at night. Nairn was twelve miles distant, and the men, weakened by privation and hunger, marched so {{slowly across the}} marshy ground that it was {{two o'clock in the}} morning before <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>columns</b> arrived within four miles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British camp, while the rear was still far away, and many had dropped out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ranks from fatigue.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Army {{employed}} Civil War-era skirmishers at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advancing <b>columns.</b> Three <b>of</b> four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. {{soldiers who}} had volunteered to act as skirmishers walking point at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American <b>column</b> were killed, including Hamilton Fish II (grandson <b>of</b> Hamilton Fish, <b>the</b> Secretary <b>of</b> State under Ulysses S.

60|$|As soon as <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>columns</b> {{approached}} {{within a}} hundred yards, {{the men with}} arquebuses opened fire; and those with crossbows speedily followed suit. Four hundred men with arquebuses at once ran forward, until within a short distance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moat; and opened so heavy a fire, against <b>the</b> defenders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall and house, that these were compelled to stoop down under shelter. Some {{of them would have}} still gone on firing from the windows, but Philip ordered them to draw back.|$|R
25|$|A muster roll from September 10, 1775 {{showed that}} Thayer's company {{consisted}} of two lieutenants, four sergeants, four corporals, a fifer, and 79 privates. That month his company was selected to join Benedict Arnold's expedition to Quebec. On the morning of December 31, 1775 the Americans opened the Battle of Quebec by attacking the city. The main column under Colonel Benedict Arnold and Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Greene was led by Captain Daniel Morgan's company. Morgan's advance guard {{was followed by the}} companies of Captains John Lamb, Henry Dearborn, John Topham, and Thayer. Seven more companies formed the center and rear of the attack column. In the approach march, the column suffered some casualties from enemy fire. Since a snow storm was raging, the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column</b> became disoriented and lost its direction before Thayer, who knew the way, led the soldiers on. Presently, they arrived before a barrier armed with two cannons which fired, causing further losses. As the guns were withdrawn to reload, Thayer and Morgan climbed through the gunports, followed by their men, and captured 60 of the defenders. Continuing up the street, the Americans surprised a group of Quebec militia and made them prisoners, making a total of 130. Since their own firearms were wet from the snow, the Americans appropriated the dry weapons of the Canadians. A second barrier farther along repelled all their attempts to seize it, partly because so many muskets misfired in the blizzard. After four hours of fighting, the Americans found themselves trapped and they surrendered when the British promised to grant them quarter.|$|E
500|$|During the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August, Mikasa {{was at the}} <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column</b> of Japanese battleships {{and was one of}} {{the primary}} targets of the Russian ships. She was hit twenty times, two of which knocked out her aft 12-inch gun turret, and {{suffered}} 125 casualties among her crew. In turn, she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships [...] and [...] although both ships were only lightly damaged by the Japanese shells which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact.|$|E
500|$|About {{six miles}} (9.6km) from the fort, the road dipped {{more than fifty}} feet (15 m) into a marshy ravine, where a stream about three feet (1 m) wide meandered along the bottom. [...] Sayenqueraghta and Cornplanter, two Seneca war chiefs, chose this place {{to set up an}} ambush. [...] While the King's Royal Yorkers waited behind a nearby rise, the Indians {{concealed}} themselves {{on both sides of the}} ravine. [...] The plan was for the Yorkers to stop the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column,</b> after which the Indians would attack the extended column. [...] At about 10 am, Herkimer's column, with Herkimer on horseback near the front, descended into the ravine, crossed the stream, and began ascending the other side.|$|E
50|$|The corps led by Johann von Hiller (VI), Heinrich Graf von Bellegarde (I) and Prince Friedrich of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (II) were to {{converge}} upon Aspern, while Prince Franz Seraph of Rosenberg-Orsini (IV) was to attack Essling.

500|$|That evening, 18 February, the {{regiment}} moved out, but before long {{the width of}} the track forced them to dismount and lead their horses by hand in single file. At 22:30 the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column</b> came under fire from Turkish cavalry. They forced the Turks to withdraw, and later surrounded and captured several prisoners, one being Ali Salem a well-known Turkish spy. Continuing at 06:00 they captured their first objective two miles to the east of Mar Saba. Spreading out to capture any retreating Turkish forces, they advanced north, under fire, and at 10:40 joined up with the 60th Division. Mounted patrols were then sent out, one of which located a strong Turkish position. Located on the [...] "Ancient Road" [...] to Hill 306 and on to Hill 288, the Turkish positions were supported by five artillery pieces at Neba Musa.|$|E
500|$|Schneider {{described}} {{the contribution of}} the 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion to the battle as [...] "everything but awe-inspiring". The Tiger companies and the Panzer-Lehr Division averted a serious British breakthrough but {{there was no need for}} the German counter-attack to have been piecemeal. Möbius and the 1st Company was in command of the road to Caen so Wittmann had time to plan a coordinated attack. Schneider wrote that [...] "a competent tank company commander does not accumulate so many serious mistakes". By putting the Tigers in a sunken lane overnight, with a vehicle with engine trouble at the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column,</b> Wittmann risked blocking the company. Schneider called the advance by Wittmann into the town courageous but that it went [...] "against all the rules". No intelligence was gathered beforehand and there was no [...] "centre of gravity" [...] or [...] "concentration of forces" [...] in the attack. [...] "The bulk of the 2nd Company and Rolf Möbius' 1st Company, came up against an enemy who had gone onto the defensive".|$|E
500|$|The Highlanders had {{advanced}} to within [...] of the Boer trenches when the Boers opened fire; the British {{had no time}} to reform from their compact quarter columns into a fighting formation. [...] Wauchope instructed the brigade to extend its order, but {{in the face of such}} close-range Boer fire, the changing formation was thrown into disarray and confusion. General Wauchope was killed by almost the first volley, as was Lieutenant-Colonel G. L. J. Goff, the commanding officer of the Argylls. The men at the head of the brigade disentangled themselves from the dead and most of them fled. Some of the Black Watch at the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column</b> charged the Boer trenches; a few broke through, but as they climbed Magersfontein Hill they were engaged by their own artillery and Boer parties, including one led by General Cronje himself, who had been wandering the kopje since 01:00, and were subsequently killed or captured. Others were shot while entangled in the wire fence in front of the trenches. Conan Doyle points out that 700 of the British casualties that day occurred in the first five minutes of the engagement.|$|E

500|$|As the Union cavalry approached, {{about half}} of the 120 local civilians fled south toward the {{railroad}} depot, and took positions closer to the men from the Confederate army. The initial volley fired by the remaining (and nervous) locals was ineffective because it had been fired too soon. The second volley, fired after a signal by Major Kent, found many in Captain Delaney's Company A. His group was fired upon by a company of Confederate soldiers in the street and from locals in the houses. One local, recalling this volley many years later, said [...] "The colonel commanding the raiding party was killed, and the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column</b> went down, men and horses in a confused mass." [...] He also said [...] "The momentum of the column of cavalry carried many who were near the front over the dead and wounded men and horses. It was death to them to remain or hesitate. They spurred their horses forward over their dead and dying comrades and passed between our ranks as we opened out to the sidewalks. While they dashed by us firing their pistols, we continued the use of the musket. The bugle sounded the retreat, and the column of cavalrymen faced about and retired, only to re-form and come at us again." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis's {{company had}} taken their {{designated}} position at {{the left of the}} provincial line. [...] This would have placed the Acton company {{in the rear of the}} attack when the line advanced. [...] The company in the lead would have been Captain David Brown's company from Concord. [...] When Barrett asked Brown if he would lead the attack, Brown responded that he would rather not. [...] Knowing that Davis's company was well equipped with bayonets and cartridge boxes, Barrett asked Davis if his company would lead the advance. [...] Several slight variations of Davis's response have been recorded. [...] His response is most often given as, [...] "I have not a man that is afraid to go." [...] Following Barrett's orders, Davis then moved his company to the right of the line. [...] Around 10:30, the provincials faced to the right and advanced on the Old North Bridge in a column of two men abreast. [...] At the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column</b> was Davis, Major John Buttrick of Concord, and Lt. Col. John Robinson of Westford. [...] Barrett remained behind on the hill, cautioning his men as they marched by him not to fire first. The British at the bridge, watching the provincials approach, were surprised to see, as one soldier later said, that they [...] "advanced with the greatest regularity".|$|E
500|$|What {{followed}} on {{the plain}} in front of Mantinea was the largest hoplite battle in Greek history. Epaminondas had the larger army, 30,000 strong infantry and 3,000 cavalry, whilst his opponents numbered 20,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry.* Tritle, The Greek World in the Fourth Century, 9394 Xenophon says that, having decided to fight, Epaminondas arranged the army into battle order, and then marched it in a column parallel to the Mantinean lines, so that {{it appeared that the}} army was marching elsewhere, and would not fight that day. Having reached a certain point in the march, he then had the army down arms, so it appeared they getting ready to camp. Xenophon suggests that [...] "by so doing he caused among most of the enemy a relaxation of their mental readiness for fighting, and likewise a relaxation of their readiness as regards their array for battle". The whole column, which had been marching right-to-left past the front of the Mantinean army then 'right-faced', so that they were now in a battle line, facing the Mantineans. Epaminondas, who had been at the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column</b> (now the left wing), brought some companies of infantry from the extreme right wing, behind the battle line, to reinforce the left wing. By this, he recreated the strengthened left-wing that Thebes had fielded at Leuctra (this time probably made up by all the Boeotians, and not just the Thebans as at Leuctra). On the wings he placed strong forces of cavalry strengthened by light-infantry.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 514516 ...|$|E
