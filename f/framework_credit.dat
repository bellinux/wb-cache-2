40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new model}} for portfolio credit risk incorporating default and spread widening in a simple and consistent <b>framework.</b> <b>Credit</b> spreads are modelled by geometric Brownian motions with a dependence structure powered by a t-copula. Their joint evolution drives the spreads widening and triggers defaults, and then the loss can be calculated accordingly. It is a heterogeneous model that takes account of different credit ratings and term structures for each underlying spread. This model is applicable to portfolio credit risk management, stress test, or to fit into regulatory capital requirements. The procedures of parameter calibration and scenario simulation are provided. A detailed example is also given {{to see how this}} proposed model can be implemented in practice...|$|E

40|$|Financial {{globalization}} had a rocky {{start in}} emerging economies hit by Sudden Stops. Foreign reserves have grown very rapidly since then, as if those countries were practicing a New Mercantilism that views foreign reserves {{as a war}} chest for defense against Sudden Stops. This paper conducts a quantitative assessment of this argument using a stochastic intertemporal equilibrium framework in which precautionary foreign asset demand is driven by output variability, financial globalization, and Sudden Stop risk. In this <b>framework,</b> <b>credit</b> constraints produce endogenous Sudden Stops. We find that financial globalization and Sudden Stop risk can explain the surge in reserves but output variability cannot. These results hold using the intertemporal preferences of the Bewley-Aiyagari-Hugget precautionary savings model or the Uzawa-Epstein setup with endogenous impatience.

40|$|International audienceUnder Basel II <b>framework,</b> <b>credit</b> risk {{assessment}} is of high {{significance in the}} light of correlation risk. Correlation risk is often envisioned along with business conditions and financial market's impact. We employ copula methodology to identify the dependence structures that may exist between market risk fundamentals and credit risk fundamentals. Considering credit derivative spreads as credit risk fundamentals and market data asmarket risk determinants, we describe and quantify the asymmetric link prevailing between credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is negatively linked with market price risk whereas it becomes positively linked with market volatility risk. Such patterns give rise to interesting asymmetric dependence structures between both risk sources. We are then able to balance reliably market price risk with market volatility feedback, the market trend supporting a common correlation between securities. In the light of the previous trade-off, we propose also a simple credit risk management rule...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{multi-step}} model to measure portfolio credit risk that integrates exposure simulation and portfolio credit risk techniques. Thus, it overcomes the major limitation currently shared by portfolio models with derivatives. Specifically, {{the model is}} an improvement over current portfolio credit risk models in three main aspects. First, it defines explicitly the joint evolution of market factors and credit drivers over time. Second, it models directly stochastic exposures through simulation, as in counterparty credit exposure models. Finally, it extends the Merton model of default to multiple steps. The model is computationally efficient because it combines a Mark-to-Future framework of counterparty exposures and a conditional default probability <b>framework.</b> <b>Credit</b> risk modeling {{is one of the}} most important topics in risk management and finance today. The last decade has seen the development of models for pricing credit risky instruments and derivatives, for assessing the credit worthiness ofm obligors, for managing exposures of derivatives and for computing portfolio credit losses for bonds and loan portfolios. In light of these financial innovations and modeling advances the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision has taken the first steps to amend current regulation and is reviewing the applicability of internal credit risk models for regulatory capital (Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, 1999 a, 1999 b). However, common practice still treats market and credit risk separately. When measuring market risk, credit risk is commonly not taken into account; when measuring portfolio credit risk, the market is assumed to be constant. The two risks are then “added ” in ad hoc ways, resulting in an incomplete picture of risk. There are two categories of credit ris...|$|E

40|$|Strategic {{functional}} management is the approach a functional area takes to achieve corporate- and business unit objectives and strategies by maximizing resource productivity. It {{is concerned with}} developing and nurturing a distinctive competence to provide a company or business unit with a competitive advantage (Wheelen, 2002 : 160). The credit function, with debtors as the largest current asset on the balance sheet, is such a functional area that should be concerned with providing the organisation with a competitive advantage. Although many generic organisational strategic models are available, {{there is a lack}} of guidelines on how to mange the credit function strategically. The objective of this research was to develop a framework, which could be used by credit managers as a management tool, to select those aspects of the credit function, which are relevant for an organisational strategic role. In order to achieve this goal, the following sub objectives have been identified in which the framework should enable credit managers to: scan the credit function's external and internal environments to keep in touch with opportunities and threats and to determine strengths and weaknesses, and to formulate, implement and evaluate credit and collection strategies that could contribute to organisational strategic goals. A literature study method was used to collect data to be incorporated in the development of this framework that will serve as basis for the alignment of strategic credit management principles with strategic organisational principles. The focus of the proposed framework was to use and adapt the four basic elements of Wheelen's organisational model (Wheelen, 2002 : 2) into a more specific model applicable for credit functions. It was concluded that a competitive advantage could be obtained by the use of this proposed strategic credit management <b>framework.</b> <b>Credit</b> managers should be trained on how to use this framework effectively and then ensure that it is implemented, evaluated, monitored and controlled on an ongoing basis. However, the applicability thereof in practice is reserved for future studies. Prof. A. Boesenkoo...|$|E
40|$|This PhD thesis {{investigates the}} sub-sovereign {{financial}} market in Italy, specifically {{focusing on the}} municipal bond market and on local government credit ratings. This research aims to identify empirically the economic and financial variables which affect bond yields and credit ratings of Italian local governments, and to understand the role of such variables in explaining the differences in interest costs paid by different bond issuers (or paid by the same issuer at different times) and {{the differences in the}} rating judgments assigned by the major international rating agencies. The Italian local government finance system is characterized by the several tiers of sub-sovereign governments (regions, provinces and cities) being differently linked to the central government finances, and by the central government itself conveying a non-negligible sovereign financial risk. The three local government tiers have a different institutional nature, while cities and provinces (jointly defined as local authorities) possess a similar status and are subject to the same legislation, regions are characterized by a greater independence and by a significantly higher degree of financial autonomy. These facts should affect the investors’ evaluation of local government credit risk and, therefore, one of the aims of this research is to analyze the determinants of subsovereign bond yields and credit ratings in this institutional <b>framework.</b> <b>Credit</b> ratings are investigated under a dual perspective, beyond the analysis on the factors driving the determination of credit ratings, this research also aims to study the role played by ratings in affecting local bond yields. First, testing if the purchase of a rating is rewarded by lower yields, i. e. if rated issuers pay lower yields than their unrated peers, and then if the specific creditworthiness assessment assigned by rating agencies is considered by investors when they price a municipal bond, i. e. if a AAA-rated issuer pays less than a BBB-rated one. This work is organized in two parts. Part I provides the research framework, rationale and background, including the research planning, a description of the local government finance system in Italy and the review of the literature. Part II is dedicated to the empirical analysis, presenting the empirical methodology and results...|$|E

Most recently, Atesoglu (2002) uses time series analysis and finds a positive relationship between defense spending and output.

We re-estimated the relationship and dummied all U. S. involvements in a military conflict, with similar results concerning military spending’s effect on output. Interestingly, we do find tradeoffs between defense and non-defense government spending during war time, but not during periods of peace. 1 The question of military spending and its effect on growth has received much attention over the last 20 + years.
