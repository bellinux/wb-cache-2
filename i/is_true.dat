5|$|If {{the unique}} games {{conjecture}} <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> {{then it is}} impossible to approximate MAX 2-SAT, balanced or not, with an approximation constant better than 0.943... in polynomial time.|$|E
5000|$|Both may <b>be</b> <b>true.</b> The thesis may <b>be</b> <b>true</b> {{of things}}-in-themselves (other than as they appear). The antithesis may <b>be</b> <b>true</b> of {{things as they}} appear.|$|R
60|$|Hence, if the {{original}} Set <b>were</b> <b>true,</b> this would also <b>be</b> <b>true.</b>|$|R

5|$|The high {{radioactivity}} of lawrencium {{would make}} it highly toxic to living cells, causing radiation poisoning. The same <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for actinium.|$|E
5|$|The while statement, which executes a {{block of}} code as long as its {{condition}} <b>is</b> <b>true.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{drawing method}} found by Kazimierz Zarankiewicz has been conjectured {{to give the}} correct answer for every {{complete}} bipartite graph, and the statement that this <b>is</b> <b>true</b> {{has come to be}} known as the Zarankiewicz crossing number conjecture. The conjecture remains open, with only some special cases solved.|$|E
50|$|If (B) <b>is</b> neither <b>true</b> nor false, {{then it must}} <b>be</b> not <b>true.</b> Since this <b>is</b> what (B) itself states, {{it means}} that (B) must <b>be</b> <b>true.</b> Since {{initially}} (B) <b>was</b> not <b>true</b> and <b>is</b> now <b>true,</b> another paradox arises.|$|R
5000|$|... "You must <b>be</b> <b>true</b> to {{yourself}}. Strong {{enough to}} <b>be</b> <b>true</b> to yourself. Brave {{enough to be}} strong enough to <b>be</b> <b>true</b> to yourself.

3000|$|... so, if (b) <b>were</b> <b>true,</b> then (c) would <b>be</b> <b>true</b> as well. Therefore, condition(c) {{holds in}} either case.|$|R
5|$|A polytree is a {{directed}} graph formed by orienting {{the edges of}} a free tree. Every polytree is a DAG. In particular, this <b>is</b> <b>true</b> of the arborescences formed by directing all edges outwards from the roots of a tree.|$|E
5|$|Aloe vera gel is used commercially as an {{ingredient}} in yogurts, beverages, and some desserts, although at certain doses, its toxic properties could be severe whether ingested or topically applied. The same <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for aloe latex, which was taken orally for conditions ranging from glaucoma to multiple sclerosis until the FDA required manufacturers to discontinue its use.|$|E
5|$|Although Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh remain {{convinced}} that the pre-1956 history of the Priory of Sion <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> they confess {{to the possibility that}} all of Plantard's claims about a post-1956 Priory of Sion were part of an elaborate hoax to build a cult of personality and cult of intelligence around himself in French esoteric circles.|$|E
50|$|Since P and P cannot both <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> the {{assumption}} must be wrong and P must <b>be</b> <b>true.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although it has {{not been}} shown {{experimentally}} if the spores can survive the passage through an animal's digestive tract, the regular presence of Cyathus on cow or horse manure strongly suggest that this <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> Alternatively, the hard outer casing of peridioles ejected from splash cups may simply disintegrate over time, eventually releasing the spores within.|$|E
5|$|As Plato tells it, the heckler {{hails from}} the small island of Seriphus; Themistocles retorts that it <b>is</b> <b>true</b> {{that he would not}} have been famous if he had come from that small island, but that the heckler would not have been famous either if he had been born in Athens.|$|E
5|$|Because Neptune {{is not a}} solid body, its {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The wide {{equatorial zone}} rotates with {{a period of about}} 18hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System, and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.|$|E
50|$|An {{argument}} is “valid” {{if it is}} impossible for its premises to <b>be</b> <b>true</b> while its conclusion is false. In other words, the conclusion must <b>be</b> <b>true</b> if the premises <b>are</b> <b>true.</b> An argument can be “valid” even if one or more of its premises are false.|$|R
2500|$|The left-to-right {{implications}} <b>are</b> <b>true</b> {{over any}} ring, although some authors define torsion-free modules only over a domain. The right-to-left implications <b>are</b> <b>true</b> over the rings labeling them. There {{may be other}} rings over which they <b>are</b> <b>true.</b> For example the implication labeled [...] "local ring or PID" [...] <b>is</b> also <b>true</b> for polynomial rings over a field: this is Quillen–Suslin theorem.|$|R
25|$|If P <b>were</b> <b>true</b> then I {{would know}} it; in fact I {{do not know}} it; {{therefore}} P cannot <b>be</b> <b>true.</b>|$|R
5|$|Christian apologist and philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a {{supporter}} of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise of reliable reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God {{would be expected to}} create beings with reliable reasoning faculties, evolution would be just as likely to lead to unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> This novel epistemological argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, {{is more likely to be}} selected for than irrationality, making the natural development of reliable cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones.|$|E
5|$|Creating {{a native}} pet {{industry}} in Australia related to quolls could aid in their conservation. However, concerns exist about this methodology {{in regards to}} animal husbandry, conservation benefits, and other issues. Some scientists believe that keeping quolls as pets could aid in their long-term conservation, but {{further research is needed}} on this topic to conclude whether this <b>is</b> <b>true</b> or false.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{magnitude}} of Jupiter's mass, {{the center of gravity}} between it and the Sun lies just above the Sun's surface. Jupiter is the only body in the Solar System for which this <b>is</b> <b>true.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{paradox is}} that all three {{premises}} seem to <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> but can not logically <b>be</b> <b>true</b> at the same time. If any two points (e.g. 1 and 3) are taken to <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> then the third (e.g. 2) must either be false or else produce a contradiction.|$|R
50|$|Since Q and Q cannot both <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> the {{assumption}} that P is false must be wrong, and P must <b>be</b> <b>true.</b>|$|R
50|$|He {{disagreed}} with Diodorus Cronus concerning his Master Argument, arguing {{that something is}} possible which can never <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> and that the impossible can never be the consequence of the possible, and that therefore not everything that has happened <b>is</b> necessarily <b>true.</b> Diodorus' view <b>was</b> that everything that has happened must <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> and that therefore nothing is possible which can never <b>be</b> <b>true.</b>|$|R
5|$|Einstein {{argued that}} this <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for {{fundamental}} reasons, because the gravitational field {{could be made to}} vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a study {{examining}} truthiness {{was carried}} out by PhD student Eryn Newman of Victoria University of Wellington. The experiments showed that {{people are more likely to}} believe that a claim <b>is</b> <b>true</b> regardless of evidence when a decorative photograph appears alongside it.|$|E
5|$|In {{view of the}} above, {{observe that}} for SQL's WHERE clause a {{tautology}} similar {{to the law of}} excluded middle can be written. Assuming the IS UNKNOWN operator is present, p OR (NOT p) OR (p IS UNKNOWN) <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for every predicate p. Among logicians, this is called law of excluded fourth.|$|E
