40|$|The {{development}} of a new joining technology, which is used to manufacture high strength hybrid constructions with thermoplastic composites (FRP) and metals, is introduced. Similar to natural regulation effects at trees, fibers around the FRP joint become aligned along the lines of force and will not be destroyed by the joining process. This is achieved by the local utilization of the specific plastic flow properties of the FRT and metal component. Compared with usual joining methods—such as flow <b>drill</b> <b>screws,</b> blind and self-piercing rivets—noticeably higher tensile properties can be realized through the novel process management. The load-bearing capability increasing effect could be proved on hybrid joints with hot-dip galvanized steel HX 420 LAD and orthotropic glass—as well as carbon—fiber reinforced plastics. The results, which were determined in tensile-shear and cross-shear tests according to DIN EN ISO 14273 and DIN EN ISO 14272, are compared with holding loads of established joining techniques with similar joining point diameter and material combinations...|$|R

30|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{increasing}} advocacy {{for the implementation of}} an “Orthopaedic Surgery Boot Camp” for first-year residents. These “boot camps” are being trialed at numerous orthopaedic surgery residency programs across North America in various forms. While varying greatly in length, most such sessions include surgical skills training on both cadaveric specimens and simulators. No current consensus is available regarding the appropriate structure, time, or objectives of such “boot camps,” though the literature suggests that they may be of some benefit to first year orthopaedic surgery residents. Some of the most robust data regarding orthopaedic surgery “boot camps” for first year residents is available from the University of Toronto (Sonnadara et al. 2011). While arthroscopic knot tying was not a part of their “boot camp” curriculum, other relevant orthopaedic surgery technical skills, such as wedge cutting using reciprocating and oscillating saws, bone <b>drilling,</b> <b>screw</b> insertion, and plaster splint application, were taught with statistically significant improvements from pre-test measurements. However, the application of these “boot camps” is resource intensive and may ultimately take away from other aspects of clinical training.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Spin-blind-riveting (SBR) is a newly {{developed}} joining process, which combines {{the advantages of}} conventional blind riveting and flow <b>drilling</b> <b>screws.</b> With this technology, {{it is possible to}} join two different materials by one-sided accessibility without the need of pre-drilling holes. This complex process cannot be simulated by 2 D finite element method. Therefore, a more realistic 3 D finite element model for the SBR process is developed using the commercial software package ABAQUS. The applicability of this work is demonstrated for joining magnesium alloy AZ 31 B and carbon-fibre reinforced plastics. Dynamic effects, thermomechanical coupling, material damage laws, and contact criterion were taken into account in the model. The Johnson–Cook material constitutive equation was used, considering the effects of strain, strain rate, and temperature on material properties. Finally, through simulation, the joint formation, stress distribution and riveting temperature were obtained. Furthermore, a series of experiments were carried out to validate the simulation results. The numerical results are in a good agreement with the experimental results and confirm the promising properties of SBR joints between metal and fibre-reinforced plastics. 1...|$|R
40|$|Computer-integrated surgery {{represents}} a growing segment {{of our national}} healthcare system. These systems transform preoperative images and other information into models of individual patients, assist clinicians in developing an optimized interventional plan, register this preoperative data to the actual patient in the operating room, and then {{use a variety of}} means, such as robots and image overlay displays, to assist in the accurate execution of the planned interventions. Finally, they perform complex postoperative analysis of the interventions. Borrowing analogies from industrial production systems, the process was named surgical CAD/CAM. Percutaneous (“through skin”) local therapies represent a significant portion of minimally invasive procedures. They involve the insertion of tubular therapy devices (needles, catheters, bone <b>drills,</b> <b>screws,</b> tissue ablating devices, etc.) into the body, with the guidance of intra-operative imaging devices, like CT, MRI, ultrasound, or fluoroscopy.

40|$|Horizontal shear {{interaction}} between profiled steel sheeting and concrete in composite slab is obtained through various means, such as frictional resistance due to indentation or embossment in the sheeting, interlocking at the steel and concrete interface resulting from curvature {{and shape of}} the sheeting profile under bending, and anchorage devices such as welded shear studs and crippled sheeting {{at the end of the}} span. Permanent end pour stops may provide some restraining effect to the slipping of the concrete, and hence may enhance the composite action. Despite the use of many types of devices, most reported test results of typical length composite slabs still exhibit partial shear interaction. This paper reports the enhancement of the horizontal shear interaction at the concrete-profiled steel sheeting interface of composite slab by using shear screws. Six full scale bending tests were conducted of which three specimens with different slenderness were enhanced with self <b>drilling</b> <b>screws</b> while another three were without screws. The test results show that the failure mode of composite slab can be improved to ductile type and the load carrying capacity can be increased by the presence of the shear screws. The load performance of the slab is also affected by the slenderness, which is the ratio of shear span to effective depth...|$|R

Self-drilling screws are {{the primary}} means of {{fastening}} for cold-formed steel members in cold-formed thin-gauge steel residential construction because it can drill their own holes and form their own threads. The fabrication of connections is the most labour intensive aspect of the cold-formed thin-gauge steel construction process, thus {{a better understanding of}} the behaviour of screw connections could lead to optimum connection design and reducing the cost of the fabrication. The study carried out to investigate the behaviour of single-shear connections using self-drilling screws in the cold-formed steel construction. The focus of this study is on the influence of the number of screws and screw spacing on the strength of self <b>drilling</b> <b>screw</b> connection.

40|$|High speed {{twist drills}} are {{probably}} the most common of all metal cutting tools and also the least efficient. In this study, detailed research was undertaken into aspects of drill performance and ways in which drilling could be improved in short hole depths of up to two diameters. The work included an evaluation of twist drill geometry and grinding parameters. It was established that errors in point grinding lead to increased hole oversize and reduced drill life. A fundamental analysis was made to establish predictive equations for the drill torque and thrust using modified orthogonal cutting equations and empirical data. A good correlation was obtained between actual and predicted results. Two new techniques for extending twist drill life by the use of coolant feeding holes and also the application of titanium nitride coatings were evaluated. Both methods were found to have potential for improving drill performance. A completely new design of carbide tipped drill was designed and developed. The new design was tested and it compared favourably with two commercially available carbide tipped drills. In further work an entirely different type of drill point geometry was developed for the <b>drill</b> <b>screw.</b> A new design was produced which enabled the drilling time to be minimised for the low thrust forces that were likely to be used with hand held power tools...|$|R
50|$|In restaurants, wine {{is usually}} {{served by the}} litre, 750 mL or 500 mL bottle, but a wine glass is {{measured}} in ounces. Similarly, fast food restaurants (e.g. McDonald's Quarter Pounder) often advertise measurements of food and drink in US customary units, but converted to metric units, because either the containers are made to US standards, or the franchise is US-based and uses a standard size for its products. Thus in Canada a 20 US fluid ounce bottled soft drink is labelled as 591 mL (or occasionally rounded up to 600 mL). Beer in bottles continues to be 12 imperial fluid ounces (labelled as 341 mL), but beer in cans is filled to 12 US fluid ounces (labelled as 355 mL). There is also a larger sized beer bottle which is labelled as containing 1.18 L. Some of these package sizes have been introduced since Canadian metrication began; for example, the traditional Canadian soft drink can was 10 imperial fluid ounces (284 mL), later marketed as 280 mL. Only in the early 1990s did the US-derived 355 mL size displace it. Television sets and computer screens are also measured in inches.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{develop a}} novel method of spinal pedical stereotaxy by reverse {{engineering}} and rapid prototyping techniques, and to validate its accuracy by experimental and clinical studies. MethodsA 3 D reconstruction {{model for the}} desired lumbar vertebra was generated by using the Mimics 10. 11 software, and the optimal screw size and orientation were determined using the reverse engineering software. Afterwards, a drill template was created by reverse engineering principle, whose surface was the antitemplate of the vertebral surface. The drill template and its corresponding vertebra were manufactured using the rapid prototyping technique. ResultsThe accuracy of the drill template was confirmed by <b>drilling</b> <b>screw</b> trajectory into the vertebral biomodel preoperatively. This method also showed its ability to customize the placement and size of each screw based on the unique morphology of the lumbar vertebra.

A tool for the automatic selection of joining technologies for multi material design (MMD) is being developed within the NGC project. A particular function of this tool is to consider the increased demand MMD structures place on corrosion resistance. In this paper, the influence of corrosive conditions on the mechanical performance of Flow <b>Drill</b> <b>Screw</b> (FDS) joints is investigated in greater detail. Different combinations of light metals such as high strength/stainless steel, aluminium and magnesium alloys served as the test material. The joint strength, under quasi-static and cyclic loading, of FDS joints was measured before and after six weeks of corrosion climate change testing. Furthermore metallographic sections of the samples were compared in order to evaluate the stage of surface, galvanic and crevice corrosion. To classify the effect of progressing corrosion on the mechanical properties of FDS joints the following factors are taken into account: corrosion resistance of the materials, joining parameters, geometry of the joint, as well as corrosion protection by coating. For all material combinations there is an apparent change in both the fatigue strength and the failure behaviour after corrosion testing. These results confirm that environmental conditions {{have a significant impact}} on the structural durability of MMD structures during the lifetime of a vehicle...|$|R

In order to ease the surgeon&# 39;s hand-eye coordination and to reduce the iatrogenic radiation injury to the surgeons, a robot assisted percutaneous pedicle screw placement is useful. This study assesses the feasibility and clinical value of robot assisted navigated <b>drilling</b> for pedicle <b>screw</b> placement and the results thus achieved {{formed the basis for}} the development of a new robot for pedicle screw fixation surgery. Materials and Methods: Preoperative computed tomography (CT) of eight bovine lumbar spines (L 1 -L 5) in axial plane were captured for each vertebra, the entry points and trajectories of the screws were preoperatively planned. On the basis of preoperative CT scans and intraoperative fluoroscopy, we aligned the robot drill to the desired entry point and trajectory, as dictated by the surgeon&# 39;s preoperative plan. Eight bovine lumbar spines were inserted 80 K-wires using the spine robot system. The time for system registration and pedicle drilling, fluoroscopy times were measured and recorded. Postoperative CT scans were used to assess the position of the K-wires. Results: Assisted by spine robot system, the average time for system registration was (343. 4 +/- 18. 4) s, the average time for procedure of <b>drilling</b> one pedicle <b>screw</b> trajectory was (89. 5 +/- 6. 1) s, times of fluoroscopy for <b>drilling</b> one pedicle <b>screw</b> were (2. 9 +/- 0. 8) times. Overall, 12 (15. 0 %) of the 80 K-wires violated the pedicle wall. Four screws (5. 0 %) were medial to the pedicle and 8 (10. 5 %) were lateral. The number of K-wires wholly within the pedicle were 68 (85 %). Conclusions: The preliminary study supports the view that computer assisted pedicle screw fixation using spinal robot is feasible and the robot can decrease the intraoperative fluoroscopy time during the minimally invasive pedicle screw fixation surgery. As spine robotic surgery is still in its infancy, further research in this field is worthwhile especially the accuracy of spine robot system should be improved...|$|R
