5|$|While separated, {{they meet}} the {{inhabitants}} of the mansion—Maurice (Ed Asner) and Lyda (Lily Tomlin). The ghosts soon turn the agents against each other. Scully is told that Mulder will kill her. Scully meets back up with Mulder, only for him to pull out a gun and shoot her. Scully, completely confused, loses consciousness, and the perspective shifts. It is revealed that Lyda is actually the one carrying out these actions and, through her ghostly ability to create apparitions, causes Scully to see Mulder instead. Meanwhile, Mulder comes upon a bleeding Scully lying on the floor. When <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> her to try to help her, she shoots Mulder in the stomach. Again, the audience sees that it is Lyda pretending to be Scully, manipulating Mulder.|$|E
2500|$|Évelyne Brochu as Dr. Delphine Cormier, Cosima's monitor, girlfriend, {{and fellow}} scientist. She is torn between {{her job at}} Dyad and her love for Cosima. After finding out about Cosima's illness she works {{with her in the}} Dyad {{to try to find a}} cure. She is {{promoted}} to the public leader of Dyad after Leekie's death and unintentionally helps Rachel kidnap Kira. Rachel then bans her from working with clones and tries to send her away to Frankfurt. However, Marion promotes Delphine to take over Rachel's position and Delphine enacts her revenge on Rachel. Delphine returns to Dyad, supposedly after learning that Sarah was kidnapped and has been missing for five days, but it is later revealed that her jealousy has led her to spy on Cosima and Shay's relationship, photographing and videotaping the two on their various dates. Delphine interrogates Shay, believing her to be the Castor mole. She is about to begin cutting Shay when Cosima calls to inform her that Gracie admitted to being the Castor mole. Delphine finds out that Dr. Nealon replaced Rachel with an induced Krystal and sent her to Vienna. She confronts him in an enclosed room, and he reveals that Rachel now belongs to Neolution, the group that he has been working for all along, attempting to procure the Leda and Castor original genomes for scientific advancement. Delphine calls for the guards to take Nealon away, but she receives no responses, and Dr. Nealon suddenly attacks her as he bleeds from the mouth. <b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> her, spilling blood onto her face, as a regurgitated worm spills from his mouth. Delphine shoots Nealon before the worm can reach her. As he dies, he proclaims that Delphine will be dead before morning. Delphine confronts Shay to apologize and tells her that she is giving Cosima permission to reveal everything to Shay, stating that the two are right for each other. She then visits Cosima at Bubbles, discreetly saying goodbye to Cosima and the other Leda clones. Delphine parks her car in a parking garage and is followed by unseen pursuer. Delphine asks [...] "what will happen to ?" [...] and receives no response; instead, the pursuer shoots Delphine, whose death is implied but not seen. Krystal confirms in season 4 that Delphine was picked up, alive, by after being shot. She has been on the Island in the north this whole time after being spared by PT Westmoreland, she reunites with a hypothermic Cosima. (recurring seasons 1 & 4–5; regular seasons 2–3) ...|$|E

60|$|He {{has nothing}} to say. With a long whispered whistle, he drops into the wicker chair and stares before him like a beggared gambler. But a cunning look soon comes into his face. <b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> towards her on his right elbow, and speaks in a low steady voice.|$|E
60|$|But his harrowed {{mind and}} {{exhausted}} body no longer allowed him even anxiety. Weak, yet excited, his senses fled; and when Arundel Dacre returned {{in the evening}} he found his friend delirious. He sat by his bed for hours. Suddenly the Duke speaks. Arundel Dacre rises: <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> the sufferer's couch.|$|E
6000|$|Henley {{is nowhere}} now except that, red-faced and jolly like an October sunset, <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> a gate at Worthing {{after a long}} day of picnicking at Chanctonbury Ring, or sits at his Woking table praising and quoting [...] "The Admiral Bashville," [...] or blue-shirted and wearing that hat that Nicholson has painted, is thrust and lugged, {{laughing}} and talking aside in his bath-chair, along the Worthing esplanade...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the banisters, as {{the bell}} {{of the front}} door was rung.|$|R

6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> {{the table}} toward {{me with an}} evident desire to make himself {{perfectly}} understood. [...] "I find myself like some creature that is taken out of its shell--soft and new. I was trained to dress in a certain way, to behave in a certain way, to think in a certain way; I see now it's all wrong and narrow--most of it anyhow--a system of class shibboleths. We were decent {{to each other in}} order to be a gang {{to the rest of the}} world. Gentlemen indeed! But it's perplexing------" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Young Man: [...] "Oh, a dozen--two dozen; I don't know! I want very long, slender stems, and {{the flowers}} with loose open petals; none of those stout, tough-looking little buds. Here! This, and this, and all these; no, I don't want any of those at all." [...] He selects the {{different}} stems of roses, and while the florist gets a box, and prepares it with a lining of cotton and tissue-paper, <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> and writes on a card. He pauses and puts up his pencil; then he takes it out again and covers the card with writing. He gives it to the florist.

[He stops to listen. Hearing no sound, he closes the door behind him and comes forward to the table. He throws himself into the rocking-chair--despondently.] There's no one here, I'm thinking, and 'tis a great fool I am to be coming. [With a sort of dumb, uncomprehending anguish.] Yerra, Mat Burke, 'tis a great jackass you've become and what's got into you at all, at all? She's gone out of this long ago, I'm telling you, and you'll never see her face again. [ANNA stands up, hesitating, {{struggling}} between joy and fear. BURKE'S eyes fall on ANNA'S bag. <b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> to examine it.] What's this? [Joyfully.] It's hers. She's not gone! But where is she? Ashore? [Darkly.] What would she be doing ashore on this rotten night? [His face suddenly convulsed with grief and rage.] 'Tis that, is it? Oh, God's curse on her! [Raging.] I'll wait 'till she comes and choke her dirty life out. [ANNA starts, her face grows hard. She steps into the room, the revolver in her right hand by her side.] ...|$|E

6000|$|LIFE. The briefest {{outline of}} Donne's life shows its intense human interest. He {{was born in}} London, {{the son of a}} rich iron merchant, at the time when the merchants of England were {{creating}} a new and higher kind of princes. On his father's side he came from an old Welsh family, and on his mother's side from the Heywoods and Sir Thomas More's family. Both families were Catholic, and in his early life persecution was brought near; for his brother died in prison for harboring a proscribed priest, and his own education could not be continued in Oxford and Cambridge because of his religion. Such an experience generally sets a man's religious standards for life; but presently Donne, as he studied law at Lincoln's Inn, was investigating the philosophic grounds of all faith. Gradually he left the church in which he was born, renounced all denominations, and called himself simply Christian. Meanwhile he wrote poetry and shared his wealth with needy Catholic relatives. He joined the expedition of Essex for Cadiz in 1596, and for the Azores in 1597, and on sea and in camp found time to write poetry. Two of his best poems, [...] "The Storm" [...] and [...] "The Calm," [...] belong to this period. Next he traveled in Europe for three years, but occupied himself with study and poetry. Returning home, he became secretary to Lord Egerton, {{fell in love with the}} latter's young niece, Anne More, and married her; for which cause Donne was cast into prison. Strangely enough his poetical work at this time is not a song of youthful romance, but [...] "The Progress of the Soul," [...] a study of transmigration. Years of wandering and poverty followed, until Sir George More forgave the young lovers and made an allowance to his daughter. Instead of enjoying his new comforts, Donne grew more ascetic and intellectual in his tastes. He refused also the nattering offer of entering the Church of England and of receiving a comfortable [...] "living." [...] By his [...] "Pseudo Martyr" [...] he attracted the favor of James I, who persuaded him to be ordained, yet left him without any place or employment. When his wife died her allowance ceased, and Donne was left with seven children in extreme poverty. Then he became a preacher, rose rapidly by sheer intellectual force and genius, and in four years was the greatest of English preachers and Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral in London. There he [...] "carried some to heaven in holy raptures and led others to amend their lives," [...] and as <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> the pulpit with intense earnestness is likened by Izaak Walton to [...] "an angel leaning from a cloud." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{video clip}} [...] "goes from a female student longing for her teacher to her taking direct action by kissing him as <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> her in class." [...] The actor playing {{the part of}} the teacher was Magnus Härenstam.|$|E
60|$|A look in Mr. Bundercombe's face {{suddenly}} froze {{the words}} upon my lips. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> toward me.|$|R

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the bed-rail {{and laughed}} joyously. Mr. Scutts, through half-closed eyes, {{gazed at him}} in silent reproach.|$|R
5000|$|Percy travels from Sydney to New York. He {{is thrown}} out of a cinema, fights a 16 stone actor for the {{privilege}} of playing the part of an attractive young lady's younger brother, treats a young girl to a plate og spaghetti in a tango restaurant, argues with her infuriated husband, is fleeced of every penny by race course crooks and has to work his way home as a steward. At the end <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> the side of the vessel and says [...] "I'm just crazy about America, but oh! I love Australia!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Lucy pays a visit Tommy at {{the strip}} club. She intimates that, given {{the timing of}} the birth, there is a chance the baby could be his. [...] "Just ’cause you’ve got some freaky {{offspring}} you wanna pin it on me?" [...] he asks. However his curiosity is aroused and he asks to see the [...] "spooky kid". Once at the house <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> to peer into the baby's cot, only to reel back with a smashed and bloody nose for his trouble. This temporarily pushes the baby up in Lucy's estimation and she gazes lovingly at him, until the face in the cot turns into that of Hercules.|$|E
5000|$|The bulk of Tighe's {{version of}} the story is taken from Apuleius, but her poem, written in Spenserian stanzas, is riddled with small details which point to Cupid's and Psyche's shared {{characteristics}} and equal standing, implying that their love is mutual, and this idea is taken further in the heavily adapted second half of the epic, where Cupid joins Psyche on her penitent journey. In the first encounter between the two lovers, Tighe mirrors a passage from Apuleius but reverses the roles, showing the similarities between the two. As Cupid comes to Psyche at his mother's request, ready to use his love-inducing arrows, <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> her, but is then overcome by her beauty and: ...|$|E

50|$|In Bath, {{a middle-aged}} woman's fourth husband falls ill during sex and dies soon after. The wife quickly decides {{to marry a}} young student, {{literally}} running from her late husband's funeral in one wing of a cathedral to her wedding in another wing. On their wedding night, the wife of Bath's fifth husband reads to her from a book denouncing the evils of women. The wife of Bath demands that he not tell her about her own business, and destroys the book. Her husband pushes her away, and she falls onto her back and moans on the floor. When <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> to comfort her, however, she bites his nose. This episode {{is derived from the}} prologue to the Wife of Bath's Tale rather than the tale itself.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the villagers}} heard noises while on his porch. <b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> the edge and a frankenfish leaps up and decapitates him.

On a neighboring stilt house, Ricardo baits a large hook using an entire catfish and manages to land one of the frankenfish. Nearly {{as big as a}} full-grown man, the fish can breathe air and hops forward biting at Ricardo's legs. Ricardo manages to kill it with a shotgun blast to the head. In vengeance he tears out its heart and barbecues it. As he takes his first bite a second frankenfish leaps from the water and devours him.|$|E
