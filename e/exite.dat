40|$|The {{structure}} of the outer parts of the maxillae and post-maxillary limbs is compared across the major crustacean groups. New anatomical observations are presented on the musculature of selected limbs of key taxa and general patterns in limb structure for the Crustacea are discussed. Exopodites vary in form but are typically provided with musculature, whereas epipodites and other <b>exites</b> lack musculature in all post-maxillary limbs. Within the Crustacea, only the Myodocopa possesses an epipodite on the maxilla. New evidence from developmental genetics, from embryology, and from new Palaeozoic fossils is integrated into a wider consideration of the homology of <b>exites</b> (outer lobes). This evidence supports the homology of the distal epipodite of anostracan branchiopods with the epipodite-podobranch complex of malacostracans.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{comparative}} cell lineage analysis of uniramous and biramous limbs of an arthropod, the crustacean Orchestia cavimana.

We show that the two main branches of crustacean limbs, exopod and endopod, are formed by a secondary subdivision of the growth zone of the main limb axis. Additional limb outgrowths such as <b>exites</b> result from the establishment of new axes. In contrast to general belief, uniramous limbs in Orchestia are not formed by the loss of the exopod but by suppression of the split into exopod and endopod. Our results offer a developmental approach to discriminate between the different kinds of branches of arthropod appendages.
