The examples of these problems are fungus growth, peeling paint, termite attack, dampness, <b>defective</b> rainwater <b>goods,</b> roof defects, harmful growth, settlement, foundation failure, roof collapse and others.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the Swedish regulations of purchase taking {{the perspective of}} private persons as a starting point. The law of purchase from the year 1990 is applicable {{on a number of}} legal purchase situations where the contracting parties varies. Nevertheless, the law is mainly focused on the purchase between businessmen. This places private persons on level with businessmen, since they are given equal responsibility regarding legal knowledge and the drawing up of contracts.   In order to get a deeper knowledge of the law of purchase and to reach an understanding of how it should be interpreted we have studied the government bill on the law, cases from the Supreme Court, doctine on the area and legal articles. The purpose with this paper is to examine whether the law of purchase from the year 1990 is too old to be applicable on private purchases today. The reason would be the trade which has been modernised through the increased use of the Internet. Almost 90 % of the trade between private persons takes place through the Internet. Our intention is also to emphasise that the law of purchase lays too much responsibility on private persons and gives them too little protection at private purchases.   Since the law of purchase concentrates on trade between businessmen in the first place it is most suitable for people with legal knowledge. Hence it does not seem logical that it also applies on trade between private persons. The interpretation of the law might be difficult because of its vague wording. Several rules can make it problematic for a purchaser with low knowledge of the rules to invoke the sellers responsibility for a <b>defective</b> <b>good.</b> Moreover, according to the law the purchaser has a duty to inspect the good and this must be done carefully in order to avoid a situation where the seller will be able to escape from his responsibility.   As a result of this the law of purchase do not guarantee private persons any protection in practise. Since contracts are superior to the law it is possible to agree that rules involving protection should not be valid. To avoid insecurity and to secure evidence it is therefore important that the contracting parties carefully draft their contract. A comparison to the legal minimum protection of consumers clearly shows that the protection in the law of purchase seems relatively weak. Furthermore, because the law shall be interpreted in the light of secondary sources of law, which demands exstensive legal knowledge of the general public, legal security might be negatively affected.   We claim that {{it would be possible to}} reach a better harmonisation between the law of purchase and the current trade behaviour through a distinction between the regulation of trade between businessmen and the trade between private persons and also by introducing cogent rules for private persons...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a system with}} three possible states, <b>good,</b> <b>defective</b> and failed. Failures are detected {{as soon as they}} occur; the defective state, which is only revealed by inspection, does not prevent the system from fulfilling the function for which it was designed. We present a maintenance model consisting of periodic inspections to check the state of the system, in which inspections are subject to error. At a false positive inspection the system is unnecessarily replaced; at a false negative inspection a defect remains unrevealed with reliability implications for future operation. The model is illustrated with an example from the railways. In this context, we suppose that system lifetime is heterogeneous so that the time the system spends in the defective state is a random variable from a mixed distribution. We determine under what circumstances the cost of maintenance cannot be justified by its efficacy, and suggest that when there is the possibility that replacement is poorly executed (lifetime heterogeneity) the natural response to imperfect inspection of increasing the inspection frequency can be counter-productiv...|$|R

40|$|The Economic Production Quantity (EPQ) {{model is}} {{commonly}} used by practitioners {{in the fields of}} production and inventory management to assist them in making decision on production lot size. The common assumptions in this model are that all units produced are perfect and shortages are not allowed.

Hence, the defective items can not be ignored in the production process. Rework process is necessary to convert those <b>defective</b> into finished <b>goods.</b> This study proposes EPQ model that incorporates both imperfect production quality and falsely not screening out a proportion of defects, thereby passing them on to customers, resulting in defect sales returns.

40|$|Liability for <b>defective</b> {{products}} (<b>goods</b> and services) in Australia {{exists at}} both common law and under statute. Relevant legislation is found at both federal, State and Territorial levels. The principal statute of relevance is the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), a federal statute. As the federal parliament is a legislature of limited law making powers, the Trade Practices Act targets conduct by corporations in trade or commerce, rather than unincorporated businesses. In practice of course, most suppliers of products are incorporated. Unincorporated businesses (as well as incorporated ones) are {{targeted by the}} State and Territorial Fair Trading Acts, which contain consumer provisions parallelling, more or less, those in the Trade Practices Act. In common with other industrialised countries, Australian law {{over the last four}} decades has evolved so as to vest a plethora of new rights and remedies in consumers of products. This development has been principally (but not exclusively) at the level of statute law. The new statutory law has added to common law rights and remedies, and to some extent, has displaced these. In particular, it has augmented the consumers' ability to sue suppliers with whom they are not in contractual relationship, and it has frequently imposed strict liability upon the supplier. The new law has also created broadened access to justice, such as by creating non-judicial tribunals to determine consumer claims expeditiously and cheaply. The ongoing process of reviewing and developing consumer policy and law attracts strong public, media and political support. This paper examines the civil law governing liability for defective products. The rules creating substantive rights and liabilities will be examined, following which the institutional framework for the determination of claims for defective products will be reviewed. 18 page(s...|$|R

This issue may occur due to problems during design stage or construction stage. Building defects not only occur in specific or certain place, but it involves from many different range which are from complex foundation and framing issues to aesthetic issues. The main {{purpose of this study}} is identifying types of the building defects, to determine the causes or factors of the building defects and also to analyze appropriate methods and techniques of building maintenance. In this study, the scope will be focusing in Peninsular Malaysia. Questionnaires are distributed to the selected company and also an interview session is conducted with related person on selected company. Data and information are gathered and analyzed using statistical method which is Average Index Percentage using Microsoft Excel. It is found that, twelve (12) defects are identified which are fungus stain and harmful growth, erosion of mortar joint, peeling paint, defective rendering plaster, cracking walls and leaning walls, <b>defective</b> rainwater <b>goods,</b> decayed floorboards, insect or termite attacks, roof defects, dampness penetration through walls, unstable foundations and poor installation of airconditioning units. The factors that cause the defects are climate condition, location of the building, building type and change of use, maintenance approach to the building, building age, support and humidity. There are many methods to maintaining the building. For example, there are six (6) methods for peeling paint defect which are water washing, stream stripping, chemical paint removers, abrasive method, hot air paint stripper and burning off method.
