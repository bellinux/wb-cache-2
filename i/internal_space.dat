5|$|As {{the tunnels}} were constructed, they were {{generally}} supported by wooden beams and posts. Once the mine had been finished, the <b>internal</b> <b>space</b> {{was filled with}} combustibles, such as brushwood, firewood, resin, and other incendiary substances; once ignited, these would burn the supporting props, causing the mine to collapse, bringing down with it the structures lying above. From the 15th century, gunpowder was also used, although the aim remained to burn the props.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods, as with molluscs, have an {{epithelial}} mantle that secretes {{and lines}} the shell, and encloses the internal organs. The brachiopod body occupies only {{about one-third of}} the <b>internal</b> <b>space</b> inside the shell, nearest the hinge. The rest of the space is lined with the mantle lobes, extensions that enclose a water-filled space in which sits the lophophore. The coelom extends into each lobe as a network of canals, which carry nutrients to the edges of the mantle.|$|E
5|$|At its {{session of}} 23 November 2006, the {{planning}} {{committee of the}} city council charged its staff with examining how the Altes Stadthaus could be used for large-scale retail without damaging it as an architectural landmark. The report, which was presented at the end of December, recommended reuse of the already modified <b>internal</b> <b>space</b> housing the library, and creation of additional usable space up to a total of approximately 1600m². This could be done by lowering the floor to street level and modifying stairway areas without changing the external appearance of the building, which is characteristic of government buildings of the 1920s, particularly in its blocky ground floor. Changes to the upper floors, which remained largely in their original condition, were not recommended.|$|E

Unlike the international version, the Chinese models feature a removable back cover, exposing a microSD slot for storage expansion and dual SIM card slots. Complementing this feature, {{a special edition}} with a Wang Leehom-autographed back cover was also released. HTC stated that {{it was able to}} include an SD card slot in the Chinese model because its radio hardware did not take up as much <b>internal</b> <b>space</b> as that of the international models.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertical}} triple expansion engines consumed {{large amounts}} of <b>internal</b> <b>space</b> that could otherwise {{have been used for}} magazines. Without sufficient magazine capacity to support superfiring centerline turrets, designers were compelled to distribute six main turrets in an unusual hexagonal configuration. Two twin turrets were mounted fore and aft (one on each end), and two were mounted on each flank of the ship. Firing directly forward and aft, the ships could bring 6 guns to bear, and 8 on the broadside; this was the same theoretical capability as Dreadnought, but the Nassau-class ships required two additional guns to achieve it. It was considered that this arrangement provided a useful reserve of heavy guns that were shielded from enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|Like bryozoans and phoronids, brachiopods have a lophophore, a {{crown of}} tentacles whose cilia (fine hairs) create a water current {{that enables them to}} filter food {{particles}} out of the water. However a bryozoan or phoronid lophophore is a ring of tentacles mounted on a single, retracted stalk, while the basic form of the brachiopod lophophore is U-shaped, forming the brachia ("arms") from which the phylum gets its name. Brachiopod lophophores are non-retractable and occupy up to two-thirds of the <b>internal</b> <b>space,</b> in the frontmost area where the valves gape when opened. To provide enough filtering capacity in this restricted space, lophophores of larger brachiopods are folded in moderately to very complex shapes—loops and coils are common, and some species' lophophores resemble a hand with the fingers splayed. In all species the lophophore is supported by cartilage and by a hydrostatic skeleton (in other words by the pressure of its internal fluid), and the fluid extends into the tentacles. Some articulate brachiopods also have a brachidium, a calcareous support for the lophophore attached {{to the inside of the}} brachial valve.|$|E

5|$|The Porsche hull designs {{included}} a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension {{was the same}} as on the Elefant tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired bogies sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved <b>internal</b> <b>space</b> and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a Diesel-electric transmission, only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the prime mover), similar to a gasoline-electric hybrid but without a storage battery; two separate drive trains in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; gasoline engine – electric generator – electric motor – drive sprocket. This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the Tiger (P) (later Elefant prototypes) and in some US designs, but had never been put into production. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later Jagdtiger tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives. Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.|$|E
5|$|The XF-104 had {{a radical}} wing design. Most {{supersonic}} jets use a swept or delta wing. This allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance, lift, and <b>internal</b> <b>space</b> for fuel and equipment. However {{the most efficient}} shape for high-speed, supersonic flight had {{been found to be}} a small, straight, mid-mounted, trapezoidal wing of low aspect ratio and high wing loading. The wing was extremely thin, with a thickness-to-chord ratio of only 3.4%. The leading edges of the wing were so thin (0.016in/0.41mm) and so sharp that they presented a hazard to ground crews, and protective guards had to be installed during ground operations. The thinness of the wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in the fuselage. The hydraulic actuators driving the ailerons were only one inch (25mm) thick to fit into the available space and were known as Piccolo actuators because of their resemblance to this musical instrument. The wings had electrically driven leading and trailing edge flaps to increase lift at low speed. The XF-104 did not feature the Boundary Layer Control System of the production aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) is a membranous synthesis and transport organelle {{that is an}} extension of the nuclear envelope. More than half the total membrane in eukaryotic cells is accounted for by the ER. The ER is made up of flattened sacs and branching tubules that are thought to interconnect, so that the ER membrane forms a continuous sheet enclosing a single <b>internal</b> <b>space.</b> This highly convoluted space is called the ER lumen and is also referred to as the ER cisternal space. The lumen takes up about ten percent of the entire cell volume. The {{endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane allows molecules to be selectively transferred between the lumen and the cytoplasm, and since it is connected to the nuclear envelope, it provides a channel between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.|$|E

40|$|We obtain new {{consistent}} Kaluza-Klein embeddings of the gauged supergravities {{with half}} of maximal supersymmetry in dimensions D = 7, 6, 5 and 4.

The new <b>internal</b> <b>spaces</b> are in some sense “mirror manifolds ” that are dual to the original internal spheres. The vacuum AdS solutions of the gauged supergravities then give rise to warped products with these <b>internal</b> <b>spaces.</b> As well as these embeddings, which have singularities, we also construct new non-singular warped Kaluza-Klein embeddings for the D = 5 and D = 4 gauged supergravities.

40|$|In Kaluza-Klein {{models with}} an {{arbitrary}} number of toroidal <b>internal</b> <b>spaces,</b> we investigate soliton solutions which describe the gravitational field {{of a massive}} compact object. We single out the physically interesting solution corresponding to a point-like mass. For the general solution we obtain equations of state in the external and <b>internal</b> <b>spaces.</b> These equations demonstrate that the point-like mass soliton has dust-like equations of state in all spaces. We also obtain the PPN parameters, which give the possibility to obtain the formulas for perihelion shift, deflection of light and time delay of radar echoes. Additionally, the gravitational experiments lead to a strong restriction on the parameter of the model: τ = -(2. 1 ± 2. 3) × 10 ^- 5. The point-like mass solution contradicts this restriction. The condition τ= 0 satisfies the experimental limitation and defines {{a new class of}} solutions which are indistinguishable from general relativity. We call such solutions latent solitons. Black strings and black branes belong to this class. Moreover, the condition of stability of the <b>internal</b> <b>spaces</b> singles out black strings/branes from the latent solitons and leads uniquely to the black string/brane equations of state p_i=-ϵ/ 2, in the <b>internal</b> <b>spaces</b> and to the number of the external dimensions d_ 0 = 3. The investigation of multidimensional static spherically symmetric perfect fluid with dust-like equation of state in the external space confirms the above results.
