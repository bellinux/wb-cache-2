Hits from 1977 included Who Is Poly Styrene?, La Dame Aux Gladiolas, {{a portrait of}} Edna Everage, and most notably the groundbreaking My Way, an <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> of the song, by Finch and Wall.

Other successes included Megahey's portrait of Orson Welles (1982), Williams's study of George Orwell (1982), Yentob's portrait of Mel Brooks (1981) and Wall's four-part documentary on Slim Gaillard (1989).|$|E

Examining Trump’s rhetorically generated relationships with the media, immigrants, politicians, and women, this paper explores the increasing importance of sophistic rhetoric and rhetorical ethos. Appeals to audience identification through in-groups and out-groups are explored, followed by an <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> of violent metaphors and sanctity considerations to Trump’s voter base. Trump’s successful self perpetuating cycle of shocking statements, followed by increased news coverage and political popularity is explained. Finally, this paper analyzes the historical precedent of Wendell Willkie, the 1940 Republican Presidential Nominee, demonstrating the possibility of a Trump nomination...|$|E
40|$|A Biblical-Exegetical <b>Examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Appeal</b> to the Trinity inContemporary Catholic Theology of Religions:The Case of Jacques Dupuis and Gavin DCosta Promoter: Prof. T. Merrigan, Co-Promotor: Prof. G. Van Belle In {{the recent}} Catholic {{theology}} of religions,[1] {{there have been}} several attempts to re-think the place of non-Christian religions in Gods plan of salvation by means of an appeal to the Trinity. The two most important representatives of this approach are J. Dupuis[2] and Gavin DCosta. [3] Both have sought to broaden the traditional inclusivistic position[4] by exploring the Trinity as a theological framework that would allow a more receptive attitude towards non-Christians religions and promote interreligious dialogue. Though the idea of referring to the Trinity to allow greater openness to non-Christian religions can offer very interesting perspectives and possibilities for interreligious dialogue, {{it is not clear whether}} the theology of the Trinity that is contained in the current approaches is in line with either the biblical evidence or the tradition of the Church. Our dissertation aims therefore to confront the appeal to the Trinity in the contemporary Catholic theology of religions (as represented by Dupuis and D'Costa) with the Trinitarian thought of the New Testament to inquire whether that appeal is legitimate and whether these theologians do justice to the biblical texts they employ. Our major biblical sources will be the Gospel of John and the Letters of St. Paul. The following proposal is intended as a tentative description of the structure of our dissertation. Chapter 1  The Trinity in Jacques Dupuis Theology of ReligionsChapter 2  The Trinity in Gavin DCostas Theology of ReligionsChapter 3  The Trinitarian Dimension in the Gospel of JohnChapter 4  The Trinitarian Dimension in the Letters of St. PaulChapter 5  The Appeal to the Trinity in the Light of the Biblical EvidenceChapter 6  Critical Reflections[1] For an introduction to the theology of religions and a critical discussion of the three main currents of thought, see T. Merrigan, Exploring the Frontiers: Jacques Dupuis and the Movement Toward a Christian Theology of Religious Pluralism, in Louvain Studies 23 (1998) 338 - 359. [2] J. Dupuis, Toward A Christian Theology of Religious Pluralism, Maryknoll, NY, 1991. His explicit Trinitarian model of thinking interreligious dialogue is very clearly described and discussed in his article Trinitarian Christology As a Model for a Theology of Religious Pluralism, in T.

40|$|This article {{considers}} current interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> justifcation defence {{within the}} Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and finds it unsatisfactory. It argues that <b>the</b> Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal's</b> effective introduction into it <b>of</b> <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> reasonable responses test from unfair dismissal law is conceptually flawed and creates unnecessary procedural complexities. Drawing on analysis by Freer and Freedland, and on Harlow and Rawlings' red light and green light theory of administrative law, {{it suggests that}} the range test favours employers and fails to provide a truly objective test of their actions even when applied within its rightful home of unfair dismissal law. It argues that this failure is compounded when the test is transferred to disability discrimination law, where it serves to perpetuate traditional attitudes of employers whose discriminatory decisions may fall within a ‘normal’ range of responses open to a reasonable employer. <b>Examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal's</b> reasoning in Jones v Post Office reveals that the range test should be applied only to employers' allegedly discriminatory decisions, not to the investigative processes underpinning those decisions, this being in contrast to application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test in unfair dismissal law. However, subsequent disability discrimination case law is shown to have blurred this important distinction. The article argues that application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judicially-modifed justifcation defence adds an unnecessary tier of complexity for employment tribunal panels already struggling to face the challenges posed by an industrial landscape changed by disability discrimination law. The article concludes by suggesting that statutory amendment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defence is required to re-establish <b>the</b> objective test <b>of</b> employers' actions necessary to ensure compliance with the EU Framework Directive on Employment. Until such time, the already poor success rate for applicants bringing cases under Part II <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Disability Discrimination Act will be further depressed...|$|R

40|$|The {{warrant for}} {{investigating}} {{the relationship between}} Augustine and narrative ethics is prompted, among other things, by a consideration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeals</b> to Augustine among a diversity <b>of</b> views within <b>the</b> vast field <b>of</b> narrative ethics.

After a thorough investigation and evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeals</b> to Augustine among a sampling of contemporary narrativists (specifically, Alasdair MacIntyre, Stanley Hauerwas, George Stroup and Stephen Crites) I turn to the Confessions directly.
