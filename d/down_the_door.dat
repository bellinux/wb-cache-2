5|$|The Master and Mistress buy {{a female}} collie puppy named Lady to be Lad's {{companion}} and mate. Lad becomes her protector and slave, as she bullies {{him from his}} food and {{the best places to}} lie, and endures the flashes of nasty temper that lead her to bite his ears and paws. As she grows older, she becomes a generally well-behaved house dog, but when she is eight months old, she tries to attack a beloved mounted bald eagle belonging to the Master. He whips her and then locks her in a shed for the night as punishment; however, during the night it catches on fire. Lad desperately tries to break <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to free her, then howls in agony, before jumping through its high window to join Lady inside. The Master, awakened by Lad's howl, arrives in time to free them both, though both have badly burned coats.|$|E
5|$|Federal agents {{obtained}} a warrant {{to search the}} house of McVeigh's father, Bill, after which they broke <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and wired the house and telephone with listening devices. FBI investigators used the resulting information gained, along with the fake address McVeigh had been using, to begin their search for the Nichols brothers, Terry and James. On April 21, 1995, Terry Nichols learned {{that he was being}} hunted, and turned himself in. Investigators discovered incriminating evidence at his home: ammonium nitrate and blasting caps, the electric drill used to drill out the locks at the quarry, books on bomb-making, a copy of Hunter (a 1989 novel by William Luther Pierce, the founder and chairman of the National Alliance, a white nationalist group) and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City, on which the Murrah Building and the spot where McVeigh's getaway car was hidden were marked. After a nine-hour interrogation, Terry Nichols was formally held in federal custody until his trial. On April 25, 1995, James Nichols was also arrested, but he was released after 32days due to lack of evidence. McVeigh's sister Jennifer was accused of illegally mailing bullets to McVeigh, but she was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against him.|$|E

After surviving several more attempts on his life, Diamond was finally killed either by the Albany police or other Irish gangsters in December 1931.|$|E

Anthony went to Fayyum and confirmed the brethren there in the Christian faith before returning to his fort.|$|E
25|$|The police broke <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to the shop, {{only to find}} large, {{armed group}} of {{defenders}} waiting for them.

Instead of retreating, the police commanders ordered their men to form a shield wall and tried to push {{their way into the}} street. The squatters responded by attempting to burn down the shop with the police inside, but the police had brought fire extinguishers with them and were able to put out the flames of the Molotov cocktail.|$|E

Once fit for duty again, he served as a staff captain with the 46th Division in Wye, under the Deputy Assistant Adjutant General (DAAG), Captain Dawtry. In 1941 a drunk Macleod almost killed Dawtry, as the latter had retired to bed rather than play stud poker with him. He shot at his door until his revolver ran out of bullets, and then passed out after smashing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with a heavy piece of furniture. He demanded an apology the next morning for his refusal to play, although the two men remained friends thereafter. Dawtry later became Chief Clerk of Westminster Council.|$|E
25|$|Some Christchurch {{members of}} the ATS moved into Aramoana at about 6:00a.m. on 14 November. The ATS went first to Gray's house, passing bodies on the street. After {{clearing}} neighboring houses, they put a stun grenade into Gray's, blowing out the windows, followed by tear gas. Kicking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> they discovered it was empty. The group then worked down the road, checking each house, a squad {{on either side of}} the street. The ATS called up the AOS, with members from Wanganui, Palmerston North, Napier, and New Plymouth, to their backs. The group discovered Sergeant Guthrie's revolver in a garden, and a woman who had been hiding under a table for more than twenty hours.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} year or so the squatters multiplied, as did the {{tensions}} between them and the authorities. On March 6, 1982 the first seriously violent confrontation between squatters and police took place. Earlier that day, about 90 people had illegally occupied an old building. When the police moved in for the eviction, several of the squatters were wearing bandannas and ski masks to hide their faces. The police tried to break <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> but their first assault was forced back by a bombardment of bricks and other building materials.

25|$|In {{the second}} trial, however, {{the issue is}} not whether John tried to kill Monica but rather whether the officer's entry into the home was lawful. Here, the {{statement}} is not being offered to prove that John tried to kill Monica, but it instead is being offered to prove that the officer had probable cause to enter the home. Whether John was actually trying to kill Monica is irrelevant to the issue at hand; what matters is whether the officer believed that Monica was in danger and whether it had been necessary to kick <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to investigate further. Monica's statement is evidence to that effect because a reasonable person, having heard Monica's cries for help, would fear for her safety.|$|E

Police broke <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the room in which they were stationed and led them away.

Command of the mission was given to then-Colonel Robert E. Lee and his aide, Lieutenant J.E.B. Stuart, both having been on leave in Washington when President James Buchanan ordered Brown arrested. The ninety Marines arrived to the town on 17 October via train, and quickly surrounded John Brown's Fort. Upon his refusal to surrender, the Marines stormed the building with bayonets, battering <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with hammers and a ladder used as a battering ram. Greene slashed Brown twice and would have killed him had his sword not bent on his last thrust; in his haste he had carried his light dress sword instead of his regulation sword.|$|E
