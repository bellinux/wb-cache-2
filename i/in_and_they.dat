5|$|For example, {{near the}} mouth of the Yangtze, the baiji was a princess that had lost her parents and had lived with her step-father, whom she had longed to get away from. The step-father wanted to trade her since she would have been sold for a great sum of money, but as they were {{crossing}} the river to get to the trader, a storm rolled <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were drenched.

5|$|Grand Prix – This mode has {{the player}} race against 7 (or 6) teams, which are {{controlled}} by the computer, {{in a series of}} predetermined courses. The player can choose to race using 3 different engine size classes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. A fourth unlockable class, Mirror Mode, allows the player to race through a mirrored version of the tracks using the 150cc engine size. Since all karts go faster when using higher engine sizes, the 4 classes serve as difficulty levels. There are 16 tracks, divided into 4 cups: Mushroom, Flower, Star and Special. A 5th cup has the player race in every track called the All-Cup Tour. The tour always starts with Luigi Circuit and ends with Rainbow Road, but the remaining tracks show up in random order. Every race is three laps long except for Baby Park and Wario Colosseum, which have 7 and 2, respectively. After all the human players cross the finish line, the positions of the computer-controlled teams are immediately locked <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> are given points based on those eight positions, ranging from 0 to 10. At the end of the cup, there will be an award ceremony for the 3 teams, where they will get a trophy ranging from bronze to gold. No matter which position they earned after each race, everyone will move on because of these new rules.|$|E

Later on, the Griffins and Quagmire start {{to play with the}} fireworks. Peter attaches ten M-80s together and shows Quagmire, but they explode, detaching all the fingers from his right hand. With Joe's help, Peter is able to find his fingers and later gets them reattached to his hand. The next day, Peter celebrates getting his fingers reattached by going to The Drunken Clam with Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire, and they decide to continue their celebrations at Pawtucket Brewery after the bar closes. Peter is behind on his work at the brewery, as he is unable to type due to his hand injury, and Angela threatens him with the prospect of being fired if he fails to catch up, so he asks Lois to help him.

500|$|The {{popularity}} of SpongeBob translated well into sales figures. In 2002, SpongeBob SquarePants dolls {{sold at a}} rate of 75,000 per week, which was faster than Tickle Me Elmo dolls were selling at the time. SpongeBob has gained popularity in Japan, specifically with Japanese women. Nickelodeon's parent company Viacom purposefully targeted marketing at women in the country as a method of the SpongeBob SquarePants brand. Skeptics initially doubted that SpongeBob could be popular in Japan as the character's design is very different from already popular designs for Hello Kitty and Pikachu. Nickelodeon also expanded the merchandising of the show, bringing it around $500 million revenue. It was reported that SpongeBob-themed goods are the best-selling character merchandise at Hot Topic store at Park City Center. T-shirts, pillows, shoelaces, pins, sunglasses, and air fresheners were sold [...] "extremely well if they have SpongeBob's likeness on them," [...] said Erin Aguirre, lead sales associate of Hot Topic.

It was us going in and pretty much just laying down the songs with a glide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and then we'd play drums over the top." [...] Young, though bewildered by the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He recalled, [...] " [...] come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> play this weird guitar noise and it just sounds like noise, with no background. My drums were in there so I said, 'Should I drum?' and they said 'Okay.'" [...] Kannberg said, [...] "We did it really fast. We probably spent one day tracking and one day mixing it."

500|$|To {{boost its}} declining readership, Deadline {{featured}} Tank Girl {{on its cover}} many times in 1994 and 1995 {{in anticipation of the}} film's release. Subsequently, Tom Astor said the release of the film: [...] "was very helpful, but it did not make up the difference, it lost some of its cult appeal without gaining any mainstream credibility." [...] The magazine ceased publication in late 1995. Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett have since spoken negatively of their experiences creating the film, calling it [...] "a bit of a sore point" [...] for them. [...] "The script was lousy," [...] Hewlett recalled, [...] "me and Alan kept rewriting it and putting Grange Hill jokes and Benny Hill jokes <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> obviously weren't getting it. They forgot to film about ten major scenes so we had to animate them... it was a horrible experience." [...] Talalay complained that the studio interfered significantly in the story, screenplay, and feel of the film. She said that she had been [...] "in sync" [...] and on good terms with Martin and Hewlett until the studio made significant cuts to the film, which she had no control over. Peter Milligan wrote an adaptation comic in 1995, and a novelization of the film by Martin Millar was published in 1996.|$|E
