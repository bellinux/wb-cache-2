5|$|During the Brunei Revolt in 1962, the Royal Air Force {{deployed}} Hunters and Gloster Javelins over Brunei {{to provide}} support for British ground forces; Hunters launched both dummy and real strafing runs on ground targets to intimidate and pin down rebels. In one event, several Bruneian and expatriate hostages were due to be executed by rebels. Hunter aircraft flew over Limbang while Royal Marines from 42 Commando rescued the hostages <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fierce</b> battle. In the following years of the Borneo Confrontation, Hunters were deployed along with other RAF aircraft in Borneo and Malaya.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{after leading}} the {{division}} {{standing by the}} end of April, the Mets again began to struggle. The Mets would not hold first place at any point after May 1, although they came close in mid-June. By {{the end of the season}} the Mets had finished 18 games behind the first place Phillies. For its part, Philadelphia was mainly engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fierce</b> division race with the Atlanta Braves, trailing them as late in the season as September 6. However, Philadelphia would surge at the end of the month and once again be crowned division champs. 2010 ultimately served as a disappointment for the Mets–Phillies rivalry.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February, German {{troops from}} the 4th Panzer Army counterattacked the Southwestern Front troops {{exploiting}} the breakthrough {{to the south of}} Kharkov, encircling many and forcing the remainder to retreat towards the Donets, beginning the Third Battle of Kharkov. The 3rd Tank Army was ordered to relieve the encircled troops, and the 15th Tank Corps changed direction, advancing towards Krasnograd. During the last days of February, the corps fought <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fierce</b> meeting engagement with the LSSAH and 320th Infantry Division. Operating alongside the 111th Rifle Division, the 15th captured Novaya Vodolaga and on 26February resumed its advance south, leaving the 195th Brigade to hold Novaya Vodolaga.|$|E

5|$|The 6th Division's next {{campaign}} was the failed Battle of Greece, {{a disaster for}} the British Commonwealth forces sent there. While in Greece, Mackay led a hastily assembled Australian-British-New Zealand-Greek formation known as Mackay Force, defending the Klidi Pass at the Battle of Vevi. The Allies were forced to retreat <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fierce</b> assault by the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler brigade. Mackay was the only Australian general to face the Waffen-SS in battle.|$|E
5|$|The club {{were granted}} a licence {{to build a}} stand on the Railway Terrace {{at a cost of}} £25,000. Vale {{struggled}} in the league in early 1954, losing 2–1 to Hartlepools United <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fierce</b> wind at Victoria Park. Cheadle was again absent through injury, as two goals from Tommy McGuigan ended Vale's record run of 21 games unbeaten. Title rivals Gateshead then left Vale Park with a point after a goalless draw, ending the club's record run of 12 consecutive home victories.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was a British success, {{and resulted in}} {{the withdrawal of the}} Continental Army to Harlem Heights, ceding control of New York City on {{the lower half of the}} island. However, General Washington established strong positions on Harlem Heights which he proved determined to defend <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fierce</b> skirmish between the two armies the following day. General Howe, unwilling to risk a costly frontal attack, did not attempt to advance further up the island for another two months.|$|E

5|$|When {{the battle}} was joined, the cavalry engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fierce</b> {{exchange}} on the flanks. Polybius described the Hispanic and Celtic horse dismounting in what he considers a barbarian method of fighting. When the Hispanic and Gauls got the upper hand, they cut down the Roman cavalry without giving quarter. On the other flank the Numidians engaged {{in a way that}} merely kept the Roman allied cavalry occupied. When the victorious Hispanic and Gallic cavalry came up, the allied cavalry broke and the Numidians pursued them off the field.|$|E
5|$|In 444 BC, the {{conservative}} {{and the democratic}} factions confronted each other <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fierce</b> struggle. The ambitious new leader of {{the conservative}}s, Thucydides (not {{to be confused with}} the historian of the same name), accused Pericles of profligacy, criticizing the way he spent the money for the ongoing building plan. Thucydides initially managed to incite the passions of the ecclesia regarding these charges in his favor. However, when Pericles took the floor, his resolute arguments put Thucydides and the conservatives firmly on the defensive. Finally, Pericles proposed to reimburse the city for all questionable expenses from his private property, with the proviso that he would make the inscriptions of dedication in his own name. His stance was greeted with applause, and Thucydides was soundly, if unexpectedly, defeated. In 442BC, the Athenian public voted to ostracize Thucydides from the city for 10 years and Pericles was once again the unchallenged ruler of the Athenian political arena.|$|E
5|$|Nielly {{recognised}} Bligh's intentions {{as soon as}} Canada {{began to}} move however, and interposed his division so that they blocked Hamilton's manoeuvre, both ships of the division now firing on Hamilton's ship. Bligh was thus isolated, Alexander falling further behind Canada. At 11:00, the French ship Jean-Bart was able to draw close enough to Alexander to discharge its main broadside at the British vessel, the two ships engaging <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fierce</b> duel for 30 minutes, both suffering damage. At 11:30 Jean-Bart sheered away from the engagement, assisted by a French frigate, and its place {{was taken by the}} next French ship in line, Tigre. Tigre could not pull directly alongside Bligh's ship, but was still able to attack the British ship with heavy fire, receiving a battering in turn that shot away the French ship's main and mizen topmasts and inflicted severe damage to its rigging.|$|E

5|$|On August 22 & 23, 1869, Carpenter {{and other}} troopers became {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fierce</b> attack by Kiowa and Naconee Indians, who {{were focused on}} destroying the buildings and settlement on the Anadarko Reservation. Carpenter, with Troops H and L, patrolled the area aggressively and engaged several groups of warriors who were setting prairie fires upwind of the settlement at different points. Further and increasingly violent assaults {{were made by the}} Native Americans, in numbers ranging from 50 to 500 at different points of the defensive lines. The decisive feature of the engagement was a charge made by Captain Carpenter's troopers. His men routed a body of over 150 warriors, who were about to take up a commanding position in rear of other defenders. On June 5, 1872, the 10th left Fort Sill to elements of the 3rd Infantry and proceeded back to Fort Gibson.|$|E
5|$|The 39th and 2/14th Infantry Battalions withdrew {{south along}} the track {{on the western side}} of Eora Creek, passing through the 53rd which was holding Alola. The 2/16th withdrew south from Abuari along the eastern side of Eora Creek. Withdrawing in contact, several groups of Australians– {{including}} the 2/14th's headquarters company– found themselves isolated from the main body of Maroubra Force. In the confusion, an Australian counter-attack against the 3/144th caught a group of their own troops <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fierce</b> crossfire. Although the counter-attack was ultimately successful in breaking through the Japanese blocking force, it also forced a large group of Australians off the track. Over several days large numbers trekked through the jungle in an effort to rejoin their units. Several were captured by the Japanese in the days that followed, including Key, who was executed by the Japanese after interrogation.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{captured}} Rome in June and the 2nd King's {{fought in}} the subsequent advance to the Trasimene Line. The King's captured Gioiella <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fierce</b> battle that had involved the 2/4th Hampshires (part of 28th Brigade), and later secured and defended Tuori against counter-attack, earning the regiment a unique battle honour in the British Army. In about nine months of service, in difficult, mountainous terrain, with heavy casualties, the battalion was awarded four DSOs, nine MCs, three DCMs, four MMs, and six mentioned in despatches. Among the recipients were Sergeant Welsby, who single-handedly secured a fortified farmhouse, and Major J. A. de V. Reynolds, for his leadership and conduct around Casa Arlotti.|$|E

5|$|The British ships {{separated}} {{and attempted to}} escape, but the French commander Contre-amiral Joseph-Marie Nielly simply split his forces in response, and although Canada was eventually able to outrun pursuit, Alexander was slower and was caught by several French ships in succession. The first two opponents were driven off, but the third succeeded in coming alongside and, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fierce</b> and close fought duel, compelled Captain Richard Rodney Bligh to surrender his ship {{in the face of}} overwhelming odds. The battle was a rare French victory, lying between the significant British victories at the Glorious First of June and the Battle of Groix, in the Royal Navy campaign against the French fleet at Brest.|$|E
5|$|The French expedition's two frigates, both only {{partially}} armed, were detached during {{the action and}} took shelter in harbour at Guadeloupe. In June, heavily laden with trade goods, they attempted to escape to Europe, but were pursued by elements of the British blockade force. Félicité was overrun after four days of manoeuvre, submitting to the more powerful British frigate HMS Latona without a fight. Furieuse was able to escape immediate pursuit, but was subsequently discovered on 3 July by the smaller British ship HMS Bonne Citoyenne. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>fierce</b> engagement two days later, the small British ship was able to defeat and capture the French vessel, which was later commissioned into the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|The Nifo oti, or Samoan fire knife dance, {{is also a}} kind {{of weapon}} dance. The kailao is a {{standing}} male war dance of Tonga. The kailao is performed by men (less commonly women also perform it with the men as a mixed dance), who carry clubs or fighting sticks. The performers dance <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fierce</b> manner to emulate combat, all {{to the accompaniment of}} a slit drum or a tin box. Additional idiophonic percussion is provided by strung rattles worn on the anklets of the dancers, and the clashing together of the wooden implements of war, which today are either sticks or mock weapons. The dance is unusual for Tonga in that it lacks recited poetry as accompaniment, which fact is taken to mean that it was imported to Tonga from elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Vizzini, {{a staunch}} anti-Communist {{who opposed the}} fight for land of Sicilian peasants, {{organised}} his own peasant cooperatives in his area during both post-war periods, through which he deflected {{the appeal of the}} left-wing parties, maintained his hold over the peasants, and guaranteed his own continued access to the land. He was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fierce</b> dispute over the lease of the large estate Miccichè of the Trabia family in Palermo, with a peasant cooperative headed by Michele Pantaleone who had founded the Italian Socialist Party (Partito Socialista Italiano – PSI) in Villalba. Vizzini had tried hard to persuade Pantaleone to marry his niece but failed. Pantaleone used his leverage with the left wing press. In return Don Calò arranged for the crops on Pantaleone family’s land to be vandalized. There was even a failed attempt on Pantaleone’s life.|$|E
5|$|With no {{permanent}} plans for conquest, the Assyrians left control of Egypt {{to a series}} of vassals who became known as the Saite kings of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. By 653BC, the Saite king Psamtik I (taking advantage of the fact that Assyria was involved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fierce</b> war conquering Elam and that few Assyrian troops were stationed in Egypt) was able to free Egypt relatively peacefully from Assyrian vassalage with the help of Lydian and Greek mercenaries, the latter of whom were recruited to form Egypt's first navy. Psamtik and his successors however were careful to maintain peaceful relations with Assyria. Greek influence expanded greatly as the city of Naukratis became the home of Greeks in the delta.|$|E
