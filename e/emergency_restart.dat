2500|$|The Airacuda {{was also}} {{saddled with a}} complex and temperamental {{electrical}} system and was the only aircraft ever built to rely on an independent auxiliary power unit (APU) to power both engine fuel pumps, {{as well as all}} aircraft electrical systems. Systems usually powered by an aircraft's engines were instead powered by the single generator. The generator, with its own supercharger, was located in the belly of the aircraft. In the event of a failure (and they occurred frequently), the crew was instructed to begin immediate <b>emergency</b> <b>restart</b> procedures as the aircraft basically shut down. When the APU failed, the pilot had [...] "NO fuel pressure, NO vacuum, NO hydraulic pressure, NO gear, NO flaps and NO ENGINES".|$|E
50|$|The crew glided {{for several}} minutes {{and then tried to}} restart engines using the APU at 13000 ft. This was again unsuccessful. They then {{declared}} to Air Traffic Control (ATC) that they had a single-engine flameout. At this point they had four diversion airports available to them. They lost considerable altitude while continuing unsuccessfully to attempt to restart both the left engine (two times) and the right engine (two times) for over 14 minutes, using the <b>emergency</b> <b>restart</b> procedure. Despite their four auxiliary power-unit-assisted engine restart attempts, the pilots were unable to restart the engines because their cores had locked. Without core rotation, recovery from the double engine failure was not possible. At this point, they finally declared to ATC that they had in fact lost both engines.|$|E
5000|$|On 26 March 2010, Netanyahu and Obama {{met in the}} White House. The {{meeting was}} {{conducted}} without photographers or any press statements. During the meeting, Obama demanded that Israel extend the settlement freeze after its expiration, impose a freeze on Jewish construction in East Jerusalem, and withdraw troops to positions held {{before the start of}} the Second Intifada. Netanyahu did not give written concessions on these issues, and presented Obama with a flowchart on how permission for building is granted in the Jerusalem Municipality to reiterate that he had no prior knowledge of the plans. Obama then suggested that Netanyahu and his staff stay at the White House to consider his proposals so that he could inform Obama right away if he changed his mind, and was quoted as saying: [...] "I'm still around, let me know if there is anything new". Netanyahu and his aides went to the Roosevelt Room, spent a further half-hour with Obama, and extended his stay for a day of <b>emergency</b> talks to <b>restart</b> peace negotiations, but left without any official statement from either side.|$|R
