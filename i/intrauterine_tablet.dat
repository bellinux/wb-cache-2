One of the IUDs proposed mechanisms for inhibition of conception is the induction of local endometrial inflammations resulting in inhibition of the implantation of the blastocysts. The exact mechanism of action of IUDs remains incompletely characterized. It is hoped that {{the identification of the}} actual mediator or mediators involved may pave the way for the introduction of a simple local contraceptive vaginal or uterine gel or pessary with the hopeful freedom from the reported IUDs- induced side effects. IUDs induce chemotaxis of neutrophils and macrophages, lymphocytes and mast cells and that a correlation exists between the accumulation of these cells and the contraceptive action of the IUDs which may depend upon the release of {{one or more of the}} mediators released by these cells. Thus, the aim of this investigation is to investigate the possible involvement of the released mediators in the mechanisms of silk suture IUD. This was approached via the use of some mediators inhibitors and the measurement of the uterine levels of some of them using ELISA kits. To execute such aims, female Wistar albino rats were fitted with silk sutures into one uterine horn and the contralateral horn of each rat was used as a control. The animals were mated and treatment with the mediators inhibitors started on day 1 till day 6 of pregnancy. All drugs were injected (I. P). The drugs used were Hydrocortisone (10 mg/kg), Cyclosporine (10 mg/kg), Dexamethasone (2 mg/kg), Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (100 mg/kg) and Celecoxib (10 mg/kg). The animals were killed on day 10 of pregnancy. The influence of the different treatments on the outcome of pregnancy in both of the IUD-carrying and the contralateral uterine horns was evaluated. In separate experiments, the levels of the mediators PGE 2, LTB 4, TNFα, IL- 1 α and IFN-γ were quantified in the endometrial scrapings of both uterine horns using ELISA technique and the specific kits. Insertion of the silk suture on one uterine horn completely inhibited pregnancy in the horn carrying the silk suture in 36 rats. Treatment of pregnant rats pre-fitted unilaterally with silk suture (IUD) from day 1 to day 6 of pregnancy with hydrocortisone, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, celecoxib, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or with the combination (Hydrocortisone + Cyclosporine + Celecoxib + pyrrolidine) reduced the % on successful pregnancy in the control uterine horns by 22. 2 ± 14. 7 to 63. 85 ± 14 %, The inhibitions with dexamethasone, celecoxib and cyclosporine were significant. None of the tested drugs induced significant reversal of the IUD-induced inhibitions. Measurement of the endometrial mediators on late day 5 of pregnancy, revealed the presence of PGE 2, LTB 4, TNFα, IL- 1 α and IFN-γ in both uterine horn. The presence of the silk suture significantly decreased the endometrial levels of PGE 2, and IFNγ and elevated the level of IL- 1 α. The mediator inhibitors used in this study seemed to mimic the silk suture IUD in inhibiting pregnancy. It is suggested that the mechanisms of action of the intrauterine silk suture induced inhibition of pregnancy probably resides in its ability to inhibit synthesis and release of PGE 2 and IFN-γ with the additional effect of elevating the uterine level of IL- 1 α. It can be suggested that a combination of dexamethasone that inhibits the synthesis of both PGE 2 and IFN-γ together with a lipopolysaccharide with the ability to release IL- 1 α if formulated in an <b>intrauterine</b> <b>tablet</b> with slow release or formulated into a gel to be administered intruterinally on days 14 or 19 to days 21 - 23 of the menstrual cycle may prove to be an affective local contraceptive method with hopefully none or only slight systemic side effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to determine the influence of different methods used in the therapy of retained placenta on conception rate and duration of days open in cows. Research was performed on 241 Simmental cows aged 2 - 8 years divided in three groups. The first group of cows (group A) (n= 82) with retained placenta was treated with manual extraction of placenta 12 - 24 h after parturition combined with application of intrauterine antibiotics. The second group (group B) (n= 79) with retained placenta was treated with intrauterine antibiotics only 12 - 24 h after parturition and repeated 2 - 3 times in 48 h intervals. The third group (group C) (n= 80) was the control group and had physiological puerperium (without retained placenta). To assess the reproductive performance of Simmental cows, interval from calving to first insemination (days open to first service, DOFS), interval from calving to pregnancy (days open to pregnancy, DOP), relative pregnancy rate (%), first service conception rate (FSCR, %) and all service conception rate (ASCR, %) were measured. The estimate of hazard ratio for DOFS in group A relative to cows in group B was 2. 20 (p< 0. 0001), implying that cows in group B had oestrus earlier and were open shorter until the first insemination, that is, the relative rate of first service decreased by 54. 5 % in the group A while holding all other variables constant. The variable that had a significant influence on DOFS was lactation (HR= 0. 99; p< 0. 0001). The estimate of hazard ratio for DOP in group A relative to cows in group B and C was 3. 53 (p< 0. 0001) and 1. 73 (p< 0. 0001), respectively, implying that cows in group B and C were open longer until pregnancy, that is, the relative rate of pregnancy in group A decreased by 71. 6 % and 42. 2 % in comparison with group B and C while holding all other variables constant. Variables that had a significant influence on DOP were lactation (HR= 0. 99; p< 0. 0001) and peripartal diseases (HR= 0. 48; p= 0. 02). The estimate of hazard ratio for DOFS and DOP between group B and C was not significant. Cows treated with <b>intrauterine</b> foaming <b>tablets</b> after RFM became pregnant earlier and had a better conception rate in contrast to cows treated with manual extraction of placentae...|$|R
