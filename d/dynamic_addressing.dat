Perkins was working on the <b>dynamic</b> <b>addressing</b> issues. Toh worked on a new routing protocol, which was known as ABR - Associativity-Based Routing. Perkins eventually proposed DSDV - Destination Sequence Distance Vector routing, which was based on distributed distance vector routing. Toh's proposal was an on-demand based routing, i.e. routes are discovered on-the-fly in real-time as and when is needed. ABR was submitted to IETF as RFCs. ABR was implemented successfully into Linux OS on Lucent WaveLAN 802.11a enabled laptops and a practical ad hoc mobile network was therefore proven to be possible in 1999. Another routing protocol known as AODV was subsequently introduced and later proven and implemented in 2005. In 2007, David Johnson and Dave Maltz proposed DSR - Dynamic Source Routing.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} the use of <b>dynamic</b> <b>addressing</b> can enable {{scalable}} routing in ad hoc networks. It is well known that the current ad hoc protocol suites do not scale to work efficiently in networks of more than a few hundred nodes. Most current ad hoc routing architectures use flat static addressing and thus, need to keep track of each node individually, creating a massive overhead problem as the network grows. Could <b>dynamic</b> <b>addressing</b> alleviate this problem? To begin to answer this question, we provide an initial design of a routing layer based on <b>dynamic</b> <b>addressing,</b> and evaluate its performance. Each node has a unique permanent identifier and a transient routing address, which indicates its location in the network at any given time. The main challenge is dynamic address allocation in the face of node mobility. We propose mechanisms to implement <b>dynamic</b> <b>addressing</b> efficiently.

Many previous studies are suffered from some limitations that the <b>dynamic</b> <b>addressing</b> and routing protocol are not suitable in high mobility MANETs. The proposed scheme {{is based on the}} prefix delegation method in order to reduce tunneling overhead by ingress filtering and avoid unnecessary address changes. By using this method, MANETs organize a virtual hierarchical architecture for efficient gateway discovery and the optimal routing in high mobility.
