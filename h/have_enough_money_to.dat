5|$|Calling {{a correct}} letter earns the value before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E
5|$|Jack {{eventually}} married Polly in 1915, {{after they}} had moved to Elmore Street, Everton. One of the witnesses at the wedding was Polly's sister, Catherine Seddon. Daughter Edith Lennon was born that year and then Charles (21 November 1918 – 26 May 2002). The Lennons moved back to Toxteth Park, and Jack died in 1921, at 57 Copperfield Street. He was buried on 6th August 1921 at Allerton Cemetery. His grave, number 206 in Roman Catholic section 4, is an unmarked public grave. Polly could not read or write, but {{was reported to be}} very humorous and supposedly had psychic abilities. After Jack died, Polly did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> keep the whole Lennon family together, so she placed two of her children, Alf and Edith, in the Blue Coat School Orphanage. It was situated just around the corner from Newcastle Road (where Julia Stanley lived). Polly died on 30 January 1949.|$|E

5|$|Adopted {{from the}} Grand Theft Auto series, Red Dead Redemption has a {{modified}} wanted system. When the player commits a crime such as killing people near witnesses, some will {{run to the}} nearest police station. The player can bribe them or kill them {{before they reach the}} station. If a crime is committed near a police officer, the wanted meter immediately appears along with a bounty count which increases with each crime committed. If Marston's bounty becomes high enough he will be pursued by either the U.S. Marshals or by the Mexican Army depending on his locations. To evade law enforcement in pursuit, John Marston must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears. Alternatively, the player character can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear. Despite the chase being aborted, a bounty is placed upon John which will cause bounty hunters to come after him in the wilderness. It is impossible to surrender to these bounty hunters by putting away Marston's weapon and standing still as they will kill him regardless. Only law enforcement in towns and a posse will accept surrenders. The law will continue to chase Marston unless he pays his bounty at a telegraph station or presents a pardon letter. When arrested, Marston pays off his bounty and is then released. If the player does not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> pay back the bounty, the law will assign bounty hunting activities.|$|E

25|$|In 1862, {{he began}} {{studying}} art under Charles Gleyre in Paris. There he met Alfred Sisley, Frédéric Bazille, and Claude Monet. At times, during the 1860s, {{he did not}} <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> buy paint. Renoir had his first success at the Salon of 1868 with his painting Lise with a Parasol (1867), which depicted Lise Tréhot, his lover at the time. Although Renoir first started exhibiting paintings at the Paris Salon in 1864, recognition was slow in coming, {{partly as a result}} of the turmoil of the Franco-Prussian War.|$|E

25|$|The Public Library Acts of 1855 and 1866 {{were the}} last to be {{advanced}} by William Ewart, who retired in 1868. He had made great efforts to promote the public library system in Great Britain and perhaps his greatest achievement was the complete elimination of the population limits, as it allowed even very small towns or parishes {{to set up a}} public library. It was later found that this could present a problem, but as many public libraries were established by library authorities that did not in fact <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> run a library satisfactorily.|$|E
25|$|When {{the circus}} {{refused to pay}} freight charges {{to send it to}} Willow Bunch, Benard put the body on exhibit and charged {{admission}} to recoup embalming expenses. Because the Beaupré family was so poor, there was little its members could do to bring the Giant’s body home. Édouard’s father, Gaspard, travelled by train to Winnipeg with the intention of bringing his body to Willow Bunch for burial. However, when he was told he needed a double fare, he realized he did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> do so. As a result, Édouard’s family eventually assumed that his body was buried somewhere in St. Louis.|$|E
25|$|In most situations, the {{management}} team does not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> fund the equity {{needed for the}} acquisition (to be combined with bank debt to constitute the purchase price) so that management teams work together with financial sponsors to part-finance the acquisition. For {{the management}} team, the negotiation of the deal with the financial sponsor (i.e., who gets how many shares of the company) is a key value creation lever. Financial sponsors are often sympathetic to MBOs as in these cases they are assured that management believes {{in the future of}} the company and has an interest in value creation (as opposed to being solely employed by the company).|$|E

25|$|The survey's {{findings}} {{confirmed that}} the caravan route to the Great Rift Valley was the best path for the line, followed by the easiest gradient to be found over the Mau Escarpment and down to Lake Victoria. Macdonald and John Wallace Pringle, his second in command, recommended construction of a three-foot six inch gauge railway. They suggested that Kikuyuland would be a suitable place for whites to live, and their civilizing effect would drive out slavery, but the railway was needed to give access to the new colony. The IBEA Co did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> undertake construction before handing over the protectorate to the British government in 1895. Construction of the line began in 1895 {{under the direction of}} George Whitehouse, a young English engineer.|$|E
25|$|The Westchester County {{sections}} {{were laid out}} by the county's parks commission based on the parkways they had already designed. Its engineers later worked {{on the design of}} the upper sections. In its early days, the Taconic State Parks Commission (TSPC) did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> hire a full engineering staff, with terrain that presented some major challenges. Its engineer, E.J. Howe, on loan from the state's Department of Public Works, frequently complained about the commission's directive that he plan a route only where it had the land or expected to buy it, instead of planning a route and then buying the land. He also began negotiations with landowners, and his position was eliminated from the commission's budget after three years. His successor clashed with his superiors as well, and after he left in 1933 the commission relied on state DPW engineers {{for the rest of the}} construction.|$|E
25|$|Rav Scheinberg {{was born}} in Ostrov, Poland, the second son of Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchok Scheinberg and Yuspa (Yosefa) Tamback. He {{was born in}} his father's absence, as earlier that year, his father had left his wife and firstborn son Avraham Nosson to go to America to avoid {{conscription}} into the Polish army. Though he planned to work and send money back home, his father was fired from job after job because he refused {{to work on the}} Jewish Sabbath. Soon he did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> rent a room, and spent months sleeping on New York City's East River Drive with a pillow, a blanket, and an umbrella. Meanwhile, his mother, who had moved in with her parents, also struggled to make ends meet, milking cows at dawn for Polish farmers. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the family lost contact. By 1919, the family patriarch had saved enough money to open his own tailor shop and brought his wife and children to America.|$|E

500|$|Wilders' goal {{after he}} {{graduated}} from secondary school was to see the world. Because he did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> travel to Australia, his preferred destination, he went to Israel instead and volunteered for a year moshav Tomer on the West Bank. With the money he saved, he travelled to the neighbouring Arab countries, and was moved {{by the lack of}} democracy in the region, due to the conflicts at the time. When he returned to the Netherlands, he retained Israeli ideas about counter-terrorism and a [...] "special feeling of solidarity" [...] for the country.|$|E

They made television appearances on Tropicana, Sábados circulares, Sótano beat, and [...] "an unhappy appearance" [...] on Bernardo Neustadt's show.
