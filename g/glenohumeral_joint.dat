25|$|The {{rotator cuff}} {{comprises}} four pennate muscles, the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis and teres minor, and their accompanying tendons. These muscles form a cuff around the <b>glenohumeral</b> <b>joint</b> and function to stabilize and manipulate the shoulder.|$|E
25|$|Abnormal {{scapular}} {{function is}} called scapular dyskinesis. One action the scapula performs during a throwing or serving motion is {{elevation of the}} acromion process {{in order to avoid}} impingement of the rotator cuff tendons. If the scapula fails to properly elevate the acromion, impingement may occur during the cocking and acceleration phase of an overhead activity. The two muscles most commonly inhibited during this first part of an overhead motion are the serratus anterior and the lower trapezius. These two muscles act as a force couple within the <b>glenohumeral</b> <b>joint</b> to properly elevate the acromion process, and if a muscle imbalance exists, shoulder impingement may develop.|$|E

25|$|Almost all {{shoulder}} dislocations are downwards (inferior) and of these, 95% are in {{a forward}} direction. Clinically this {{is referred to as}} an anterior dislocation of the <b>glenohumeral</b> <b>joint.</b> Not only does the arm appear out of position when the shoulder dislocates, but the dislocation also produces pain. Muscle spasms may increase the intensity of pain. Swelling and bruising normally develop, and in some cases there may be numbness and muscle weakness. Problems seen with a dislocated shoulder are tearing of the ligaments or tendons reinforcing the joint capsule and, less commonly, nerve damage. Doctors usually diagnose a dislocation by a physical examination, but x rays are taken to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out a related fracture and other complications. X rays are also taken after relocation to ensure it is in the correct place.|$|E
25|$|Shoulder (<b>Glenohumeral</b> <b>joint)</b> (shoulder) – Several weaker {{functions}} {{occur at}} the glenohumeral, or shoulder, joint. The biceps brachii weakly assists in forward flexion of the shoulder joint (bringing the arm forward and upwards). It may also contribute to abduction (bringing the arm out to the side) when the arm is externally (or laterally) rotated. The short head of the biceps brachii also assists with horizontal adduction (bringing the arm across the body) when the arm is internally (or medially) rotated. Finally, the short head of the biceps brachii, due to its attachment to the scapula (or shoulder blade), assists with stabilization of the shoulder joint when a heavy weight is carried in the arm. The tendon of the long head of the biceps also assists in holding {{the head of the}} humerus in the glenoid cavity.|$|E
25|$|The scapula is a wide, flat bone {{lying on}} the {{thoracic}} wall that provides an attachment for three different groups of muscles. The intrinsic muscles of the scapula include {{the muscles of the}} rotator cuff—the subscapularis, teres minor, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus. These muscles attach {{to the surface of the}} scapula and are responsible for the internal and external rotation of the shoulder joint, along with humeral abduction. The extrinsic muscles include the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles and attach to the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, and spine of the scapula. These muscles are responsible for several actions of the <b>glenohumeral</b> <b>joint.</b> The third group, which is mainly responsible for stabilization and rotation of the scapula, consists of the trapezius, serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles and attach to the medial, superior, and inferior borders of the scapula.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the motions of natural and prosthetically reconstructed <b>glenohumeral</b> <b>joints</b> without capsular {{contracture}} in the laboratory to obtain a better under-standing of joint motion as it may relate to failure of the implant. Seven joints from fresh-frozen human cadavera were instrumented with a six-degrees-of-freedom magnetic tracking device to study patterns of translation and rotation with and without the applica-tion of simulated muscle forces (active and passive models). The specimens were tested before and after reconstruction of the joint with use of modified oper-ative techniques and implants that had from zero to five millimeters of radial mismatch between the hu-meral head and glenoid components...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} labroligamentous {{structures in}} unstable anteroinferior <b>glenohumeral</b> <b>joints</b> using MR arthrography (MRA) {{to demonstrate that}} not all instabilities are Bankart lesions.

The study included 35 patients (33 males and 2 females; mean age: 30. 2; range: 18 to 57 years). MRA was performed in all patients. The lesions underlying patients’ instability such as Bankart, anterior labral periosteal sleeve avulsion (ALPSA), and Perthes lesions were diagnosed by two radiologists. MRA yielded 16 diagnoses of Bankart lesions, 5 of ALPSA lesions, and 14 of Perthes lesions.

40|$|The suprascapular nerve {{originates}} {{from the}} upper trunk of the brachial plexus or less frequently from the root of C 5. It runs a short way and crosses the suprascapular notch. It innervates the supraspinatus muscle and the acromioclavicular and <b>glenohumeral</b> <b>joints.</b> Then, it crosses the lateral edge of {{the spine of the}} scapula passing through the spinoglenoid notch, and innervates the infraspinatus muscle. These are potential sites of injury to the suprascapular nerve. Three cases of suprascapular nerve entrapment causing an isolated infraspinatus muscle atrophy in volleyball players were studied.

25|$|The {{shoulder}} {{consists of}} a ball-and-socket joint formed by the humerus and scapula and their surrounding structures - ligaments, muscles, tendons - which support the bones and maintain the relationship of one to another. These supporting structures attach to the clavicle, humerus, and scapula, the latter providing the glenoid cavity, acromion and coracoid processes. The main joint of the shoulder is the shoulder joint (or <b>glenohumeral</b> <b>joint),</b> between the humerus and the glenoid process of the scapular. The acromioclavicular joint and sternoclavicular joint {{also play a role}} in shoulder movements. White hyaline cartilage on the ends of the bones (called articular cartilage) allows the bones to glide and move on each other, and the joint space is surrounded by a synovial membrane. Around the joint space are muscles - the rotator cuff, which directly surrounds and attaches to the shoulder joint - and other muscles that help provide stability and facilitate movement.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{examination}} of the shoulder to feel for injury and discover the limits of movement, location of pain, and extent of joint instability. The steps to elicit this information are inspection (looking), palpation (feeling), testing range of motion, and performing special maneuvers. Information collected on inspection are asymmetry, atrophy, ecchymosis, scars, swelling, and venous distention. Palpation can help find pain and deformities, and should specifically include the anterior <b>glenohumeral</b> <b>joint,</b> acromioclavicular joint, biceps tendon, cervical spine, coracoid process, scapula, and sternoclavicular joint. Range of motion tests external and internal rotation, abduction and adduction, passive and active weakness, and true weakness versus weakness due to pain. The Apley scratch test is the most useful: touch opposite scapular by reaching behind the head for adduction and external rotation and behind the back for abduction and internal rotation. Finally, there are more specific maneuvers that can hone in on a diagnosis, however their accuracy is limited.|$|E

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} (MR) imaging is {{a useful}} modality for evaluating the labrocapsular ligamentous complex (LCLC) of the shoulder. MR arthrography is an important and occasionally indispensable supplementary modality for accurate differentiation between normal and deranged <b>glenohumeral</b> <b>joints.</b> Because of the joint distention that occurs during MR arthrography, it is especially helpful in detecting subtle capsular derangement, as occurs in patients with atraumatic instability. Also, some of the pitfalls associated with MR imaging of the LCLC {{are less likely to}} occur with MR arthrography. Radiologists should look for several key abnormalities when evaluating MR images of the shoulder: an anterior or posterior Bankart lesion; a Hill-Sachs defect; a tear of the rotator cuff, glenoid labrum, or superior labrum-biceps tendon attachment; and loose bodies. Knowledge of normal anatomy, normal variations, and pitfalls in image interpretation related to evaluation of the LCLC will help the radiologist accurately detect debilitating derangements associated with glenohumeral instability...|$|R

2500|$|The {{shoulder}} joint {{is composed of}} three bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone) (see diagram). Two joints facilitate shoulder movement. The acromioclavicular (AC) joint is located between the acromion (part of the scapula that forms the highest point of the shoulder) and the clavicle. The <b>glenohumeral</b> <b>joint,</b> to which the term [...] "{{shoulder joint}}" [...] commonly refers, is a ball-and-socket joint that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body. The [...] "ball" [...] is the top, rounded portion of the upper arm bone or humerus; the [...] "socket," [...] or glenoid, is a dish-shaped part of {{the outer edge of}} the scapula into which the ball fits. [...] Arm movement is further facilitated by the ability of the scapula itself to slide along the rib cage.

40|$|We {{dissected}} a fresh cadaver {{to determine}} which glenohumeral structures causes medial rotation of the humerus during flexion in the sagittal plane. All structures associated with both shoulders were dissected thoroughly. Both el-bows were disarticulated to expose the distal end of each humerus {{to be used as}} measurement landmarks. We used a universal goniometer for measurements of shoulder flexion. To determine which structures cause passive medial rotation, the associated shoulder muscles, ligaments, and the capsule were individually reflected from the humerus. Passive shoulder flexion to the point where medial rotation started was measured after each structure was resected. The end passive glenohumeral flexion without rotation was 60 degrees after reflection of all musculature and other periarticular shoulder structures. Our results support Steindler's conclusion that during flexion of the humerus beyond the horizontal there is forced rotation caused by ligamentous tension.

30|$|Our {{model of}} the {{throwing}} shoulder is designed to quantify the passive effects of the shoulder’s supporting soft tissues on glenohumeral motion. Recognizing that the rotator cuff and the <b>glenohumeral</b> ligaments (<b>joint</b> capsule) provide passive stability to the joint at the end range of motion, our cadaveric model does not actively load the joint. For this reason, we have intentionally limited the scope of our investigation to the end range of glenohumeral motion.|$|R

2500|$|The human {{shoulder}} {{is made up}} {{of three}} bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone) as well as associated muscles, ligaments and tendons. [...] The articulations between the bones of the shoulder make up the shoulder joints. The shoulder joint also known as the <b>glenohumeral</b> <b>joint,</b> is the major joint of the shoulder, but can more broadly include the acromioclavicular joint. In human anatomy, the shoulder joint comprises the part of the body where the humerus attaches to the scapula, the head sitting in the glenoid cavity. The shoulder is the group of structures in the region of the joint.|$|E
2500|$|That is {{followed}} by the [...] "proliferative" [...] and [...] "maturation and remodeling" [...] phases of healing, which ensues for the following six to ten weeks. The effect of active or passive motion during any of the phases is unclear, due to conflicting information and a shortage of clinical evidence. [...] Gentle physical therapy guided motion is instituted at this phase, only to prevent stiffness of the shoulder; the rotator cuff remains fragile. At three months after surgery, physical therapy intervention changes substantially to focus on scapular mobilization and stretching of the <b>glenohumeral</b> <b>joint.</b> [...] Once full passive motion is regained (at usually about four to four and a half months after surgery) strengthening exercises are the focus. [...] The strengthening focuses on the rotator cuff and the upper back/scapular stabilizers. [...] Typically at about six months after surgery, most patients have made a majority of the gains.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shoulder}} joint (also {{known as the}} <b>glenohumeral</b> <b>joint)</b> is the main joint of the shoulder.

[...] The [...] "ball" [...] of the joint is the rounded, medial anterior surface of the humerus and the [...] "socket" [...] is formed by the glenoid cavity, the dish-shaped portion of the lateral scapula. [...] The shallowness of the cavity and relatively loose connections between the shoulder {{and the rest of the}} body allows the arm to have tremendous mobility, at the expense of being much easier to dislocate than most other joints in the body. There is an approximately 4-to-1 disproportion in size between the large head of the humerus and the shallow glenoid cavity.The glenoid cavity is made deeper by the addition of the fibrocartilaginous ring of the glenoid labrum.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the involvement of}} the synovial structures of the shoulder girdle of patients who have active symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: 2 secondary referral centers of rheumatology. PATIENTS: 13 case-patients who had active symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica seen during a 6 -month period, 9 control-patients who had early symptoms of elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis, and 10 age-matched healthy controls. MEASUREMENTS: Magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder was done on the 13 case-patients, 9 control-patients, and 10 healthy controls. RESULTS: The frequency of subacromial and subdeltoid bursitis was significantly higher in the case-patients (who had polymyalgia rheumatica) than in the control-patients (who had elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The acromiohumeral {{distance}} (ACHD) is a radiographic parameter {{for evaluating}} {{the presence of a}} rotator cuff rupture. Previous investigations have demonstrated that several factors may influence the magnitude of the acromiohumeral distance, but glenoid version has not yet been considered. HYPOTHESIS: Our hypothesis was that there is a direct correlation between glenoid version and acromiohumeral distance as well as subacromial clearance. METHODS: Four right <b>glenohumeral</b> <b>joints</b> from adult fresh cadavers were anatomically dissected {{to the level of the}} rotator cuff. After fixation to a board and positioning of the humeral head in neutral position, an osteotomy of the glenoid neck was carried out and the version was altered in steps of 5 °. The ACHD as well as the subacromial clearance (SAC) were measured for every degree of glenoid version. RESULTS: The ACHD increased with increased anteversion and consistently decreased with increased retroversion of the glenoid. The SAC also depended on glenoid version. Neutral version was associated with a minimal clearance under the anterior third of the acromion, retroversion transferred the minimal SAC posteriorly and anteversion transferred minimal SAC under the coracoacromial ligament. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that glenoid version correlates directly with the magnitude of ACHD and SAC. Therefore, variations of glenoid version can lead to false interpretations of cuff integrity. TYPE OF STUDY: Biomechanical investigation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Not possible to define...|$|R

Sample Population - Both <b>glenohumeral</b> <b>joints</b> from 10 adult canine cadavers. Procedures - 10 osteochondral cores were harvested {{from each of the}} 20 humeral heads; synovium and 1 core from each joint were examined to verify joint health, and the other 9 cores were exposed to canine chondrocyte culture medium (CCCM), a 0. 5 % solution of bupivacaine, or 0. 5 % solution of bupivacaine with methylparaben for 5, 15, or 30 minutes. Results - For the superficial zone of surface-intact chondrocytes, bupivacaine with methylparaben caused a significantly higher percentage of chondrocyte death at 5 minutes (47. 7 %) than did bupivacaine (23. 6 %) or CCCM (25. 4 %). Bupivacaine (53. 8 %) and bupivacaine with methylparaben (62. 5 %) caused a significantly higher percentage of chondrocyte death at 30 minutes than did CCCM (20. 0 %). For the superficial zone of chondrocytes with debrided surfaces, bupivacaine with methylparaben caused a significantly higher percentage of chondrocyte death at 30 minutes (59 %) than it did at 5 minutes (37. 7 %).
