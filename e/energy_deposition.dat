When these experiments are performed using macro-bolometers, radioactive contamination near the surfaces is of particular concern. In order to control the effects of surface contamination, we developed a novel technique that uses composite macro-bolometers to identify <b>energy</b> <b>depositions</b> that occur close to the surfaces of materials immediately surrounding the detector.

When these experiments are performed using macro-bolometers, radioactive contamination near the surfaces is of particular concern.

40|$|Data are {{presented}} from the DRIFT-IId detector {{housed in the}} Boulby mine in northeast England. A 0. 8 m^ 3 fiducial volume, containing partial pressures of 30 Torr CS 2 and 10 Torr CF 4, was exposed for a duration of 47. 4 live-time days with sufficient passive shielding to provide a neutron free environment within the detector. The nuclear recoil events seen are consistent with a remaining low level background from the decay of progeny of radon daughters attached to the central cathode of the detector. However, <b>energy</b> <b>depositions</b> from such events must drift across the entire width of the detector, and thus display large diffusion upon reaching the readout planes of the device.
