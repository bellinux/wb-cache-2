40|$|AbstractHole flanges are {{important}} functional elements in many {{sheet metal parts}}. They provide stiffness, allow for positioning and fixation, they guide cables etc. <b>Hole</b> <b>flanging</b> operations in sheet metal parts are typically performed using dedicated tooling. Recent publications proved that <b>hole</b> <b>flanging</b> by incremental sheet forming (i. e. incremental <b>hole</b> <b>flanging)</b> is an interesting alternative to the traditional operations with dedicated tools. In incremental <b>hole</b> <b>flanging,</b> limit <b>hole</b> expansion ratios of up to 4 were observed which are {{much larger than the}} typical expansion ratios of around 2. In addition, the high flexibility of the incremental sheet forming process is maintained, i. e. flanges can be formed using a universal CNC-driven forming tool without dedicated tooling. However, deficits in terms of process time and geometric accuracy still limit the industrial application. This paper investigates the process limits of incremental <b>hole</b> <b>flanging</b> and proposes two new approaches aiming to reduce current deficits. The first one is an adaptive blank holder that acts {{in the vicinity of the}} forming tool and reduces unwanted secondary deformation that would lead to deviations from the target geometry. The second one is a new process set-up that makes it possible to perform incremental <b>hole</b> <b>flanging</b> operations at high speed. Using these approaches, the flexibility of incremental forming and its advantages regarding high formability can be exploited, while the typical disadvantages such as geometric inaccuracies and long process times can be minimized...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an investigation to determine the behavior of dural strip with <b>flanged</b> <b>holes</b> in the center when subjected to shear stresses. They buckle under a certain load just as a flat sheet. There is one optimum hole spacing and a corresponding buckling load in shear for each sheet width, sheet thickness, and flange form. Comparison with non-flanged sheets revealed a marked increase of buckling load in shear due to the flanging and a slightly greater displacement. Strips were clamped between two stationary end rails and one sliding center rail at which the shear is applied. The force was measured with a tension stirrup up to 20 tons and a compression dynamometer up to 10 tons. The displacement was recorded with the Zeiss dial gauge. The following were investigated: 1) effect of strip width; 2) strip thickness; 3) diameter of flanging; 4) depth of flanging; 5) and hole distance...|$|R
50|$|While most {{tanks are}} manufactured, some fuel tanks are still {{fabricated}} by metal craftsmen or hand-made {{in the case}} of bladder-style tanks. These include custom and restoration tanks for automotive,aircraft, motorcycles, and even tractors. Construction of fuel tanks follows a series of specific steps. The craftsman generally creates a mockup to determine the accurate size and shape of the tank, usually out of foam board. Next, design issues that affect the structure of the tank areaddressed - such as where the outlet, drain, fluid level indicator, seams, and baffles go. Then the craftsmen must determine the thickness, temper and alloy of the sheet he will use to make the tank. After the sheet is cut to the shapes needed, various pieces are bent to create the basic shell and/or ends and baffles for the tank. Many fuel tanks' baffles (particularly in aircraft and racecars) contain lightening <b>holes.</b> These <b>flanged</b> <b>holes</b> serve two purposes, they reduce the weight of the tank while adding strength to the baffles. Toward the end of construction, openings are added for the filler neck, fuel pickup, drain, and fuel-level sending unit. Sometimes these holes are created on the flat shell, other times they are added {{at the end of the}} fabrication process. Baffles and ends can be riveted into place. The heads of the rivets are frequently brazed or soldered to prevent tank leaks. Ends can then be hemmed in and soldered, or flanged and brazed (and/or sealed with an epoxy-type sealant) or the ends can be flanged and then welded. Once the soldering, brazing or welding is complete, the fuel tank is leak-tested.|$|R

50|$|Few {{commercial}} {{feature recognition}} systems are also available. Though feature recognition {{technology can be}} applied for various applications, commercial software have effectively adopted feature recognition technology for recreating the feature tree from imported models so that even the imported models can be edited {{as if it were}} a native solid model. Major 3D CAD modelers have Feature Recognition to convert imported 3-D models into native feature based models. CAM software and design for manufacturing software are also built using this feature recognition technology. Few CAD/CAM software have used commercially available third-party feature recognition library, which recognizes various features from 3-D B-Rep models. Separate libraries are available for Design, Manufacturing and Sheet metal applications. Design feature recognition library can identify features such as holes of various types, split holes, hole-chains, fillets, chamfers, cut extrudes, boss extrudes, drafted extrudes, revolved cuts, revolved bosses, ribs, drafts, lofts and sweeps are identified. Manufacturing feature recognition library provides recognition of manufacturing features such as simple holes, tapered holes, counter-bore holes, counter-sunk holes, counter-drilled holes, hole-chains, hole patterns such as linear, rectangular and circular patterns, fillets, chamfers, blind pockets, through pockets, drafted pockets, filleted and chamfered pockets, simple slots, drafted slots, filleted and chamfered slots, islands in pockets and slots, machinable volumes, machinable slabs, multiple intersecting features, axi-symmetric features such as external turned profiles, internal turned profiles, turned grooves such as vee and dovetail grooves, and mill-turn features such as slots and pocket in turned profiles. Sheet metal feature recognition library extracts features from a sheet metal perspective. Various features identified through this library include walls, bends, <b>holes,</b> cutouts, <b>flanged</b> <b>holes,</b> <b>flanged</b> cutouts, notches, open hems, closed hems, teardrop hems, rolled hems (curls), jog flanges, edge flanges, contour flanges, stamps such as louver, lance, bridge, dimple, beads, embosses and ribs. Though such commercial systems can identify a variety of features listed above, further research can be driven to identify feature types that are not identified by such commercial systems. Manufacturing features such as 3-axis and 5-axis feature recognition are generally not available in such commercial systems.|$|R
40|$|Dual phase {{steel is}} widely used in today’s car body manufacturing. Its {{characteristics}} of high n- value and good elongation (A 80) are the basis of good press formability. However, practical experience has shown unexpected failure in forming operations where tight bending, stretch <b>flanging</b> or <b>hole</b> expansionare predominant. The inhomogeneous microstructure of soft ferrite and hard martensite in combination with highly localized straining is the origin of these problems. Furthermore, weldability and delayed cracking have been experienced to cause problemsin ultra-high strength DP steel. Refinement and homogenization of the two-phase microstructure as wellas lowering of the carbon contenthave been identified as remedies to the mentioned problems. However, mill processing of DP steel with reduced carbon content is more difficult especially for the higher strength levels. Niobium microalloying proved to be very effective in increasing the processing window of low-carbon DP steels besides of its natural effect of refining the microstructure. Meanwhile the production of niobium microalloyed DP steel {{has been established in}} several markets including China.

40|$|Abstract. Flanging is {{a method}} of sheet metal forming process under {{combined}} compressive and tensile conditions using a punch and die to raise closed rims (flanges or collars) on pierced <b>holes.</b> For the <b>flanging</b> product used for the automotive steering part, {{the thickness of the}} bottom radius area is very important because of the crack usually occurred during the using process. But during conventional flanging process, the thickness of the rim and the bottom radius area were decreased seriously and make the <b>hole</b> <b>flanging</b> not strong enough to be used. In order to increase the thickness of bottom radius area of the flanging wall, a new method that combines flanging process and cold forging process was proposed in this paper and a special forming die set was designed with a stripper subjected to counter-pressure with an aim to obtain a more substantial flange. FEM software DEFORM 3 D was employed to simulate these flanging part forming processes. The results showed the thickness of bottom radius area of the flanging wall was increased and a more substantial flange was obtained...|$|R
40|$|Tests {{conducted}} with a pierced light-gage, cold-formed steel channel {{were used to}} evaluate four different criteria for experimentally determining the elastic buckling loads of thin plates. The single test specimen was a ten foot length of a 14 -gage section with a nominal 8 " web and nominal 3 " lipped flanges. The section was loaded as a beam bent about its minor axis so that the web was placed in compression. A constant-moment mid-span region of five times the web width simulated a long plate subjected to in-plane compression. Tests of the unpierced specimen were followed by tests in which the specimen had a single hole {{in the center of}} the web. A repetitive process of <b>flanging</b> the plain <b>holes</b> and then cutting off the flanges created a succession of plain and reinforced holes of increasing diameter. A total of thirty-six tests were carried out. The specimen was instrumented with as many as forty electric strain gages and nine dial gages. The four buckling criteria considered were the maximum strain (or strain reversal) criterion, the top-of-the-knee criterion, the inflection point criterion, and the Southwell plot method. The last was judged to be the most accurate and appropriate, and it was applied in studying the effects of the hole on the elastic buckling load. The critical load was found to be insensitive to hole size for both plain and reinforced holes up to a hole diameter of about one-half the plate width. Tests were not conducted for large holes. The addition of a reinforcing lip increased the buckling load by over 50 %. The experimental results agree fairly well with the results of a finite element study...|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{the number}} of {{transitions}} of manufacturing products {{and the increase in}} the degree of deformation at a transition in shaping sheet metal forming processes can improve the performance of manufacturing and makes the resulting products competitive. For the drawing process developed ways of shaping with the use of differential radial flange backwater using liquid drawing in a die of special profile and the combined drawing in the double cone die special profile. Using computer simulation by the method of finite elements, was found that application of backwater significantly reduce the amount of tensile stresses in the dangerous section, which result is the destruction of the wall. Reduction of these strains has increased the degree of deformation in one transition and reduce {{the number of}} drawing transitions. The use of traditional drawing in a die of special profiles and combined drawing in double-cone die of special profile also reduced the number of presswork transitions. The experimental results confirmed the results of the calculations. Was found the analytical dependences for determining the parameters of the combined drawing in the double-cone die. For processes of reducing tubular and hollow bottom blanks were used the application of liquid back pressure to the inner surface of the blanks and reducing was applied in the die of special profile. Calculation found that counter-pressure application with reducing of tubular of steel billets leads to the exclusion of loss of stability of the preform wall and forming of the cross-ribbed on the wall and on the deformed part of the workpiece, which allowed to obtain products with the neck in one transition. During reducing was applied cone and spherical dies of special profile. In such dies deforming surface is formed by the intersection of the circles of constant diameter whose centers are positioned at an angle with a certain step. Forming on these surfaces ensure the reduction of the friction forces in forming and increasing the degree of deformation in one transition. Using the pre-operation profiling wall of tubular or hollow blanks with the bottom results in reducing products of constant wall thickness. Prototypes of products was obtained by experimental way. Was founded the analytical dependences for determining the reducing force, the shape and size of the deformed part of the blanks. The developed method of outward <b>flanging</b> of the <b>holes</b> in the sheet metal blanks and profiles provides receiving of deformed part with a constant wall thickness without distortion. Constant wall thickness leads to an increase in the height of products after outward flanging with thinning and increased reliability and durability detachable and permanent joints which are formed by outward flanging products with other items. Using the pre-profiling of the blanks and profiles by cold extrusion forming holes followed by punching jumper leads to saving metal. Calculations and experiments have shown the possibility of obtaining constant wall thickness. For engineering calculation of parameters of preliminary profiling blanks and parameters of outward flanging was founded analytical according to the definition of power modes, the specific efforts on the instrument and final shape and size of deformed blanks. For various configurations of flanges on tubular workpieces and pipes was developed method of bulging by punch of special profile. At such punch deforming surface is formed by the intersection of the circles of constant diameter whose centers are located at an angle to the corresponding step. By computer simulation was found and confirmed by experiment punch profile, which provides a reduction of the friction forces in the forming in the bulging processes and increase the bulging ratio. ?????????? ?????????? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ?????????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ???? ??????? ? ??????????????? ????????? ???????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ?????????????????? ???????????? ? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ???????????????????. ??? ????????? ??????? ??????????? ??????? ???????????????? ?? ??????????? ??????????????????? ??????????? ??????? ?????? ? ??????? ????????, ??????? ? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ? ??????????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????. ? ?????????????? ????????????? ????????????? ??????? ???????? ????????? ???????????, ??? ?????????? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????? ? ??????? ???????, ??????? ???????? ? ?????????? ??????. ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ???? ??????? ? ??????? ?????????? ????????? ???????. ????????????? ????????????? ??????????? ? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ? ???????????????? ??????????? ? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ????? ????????? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????. ??????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????? ????????. ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ???????; ??? ????????? ?????? ????????? ? ????? ????????? ? ???? ???? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ? ??????? ???????? ?? ?????????? ??????????? ????????? ? ???????? ????? ? ??????? ???????????? ???????. ???????? ???????????, ??? ?????????? ??????????????? ??? ?????? ????????? ????????? ?? ????? ???????? ? ?????????? ?????? ???????????? ?????? ????????? ? ??????????? ?????????? ???? ?? ?????? ? ???????????????? ????? ?????????, ??? ????????? ???????? ??????? ? ?????????? ?? ???? ???????. ??? ?????? ????????? ???????? ?? ??????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????. ? ????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????, ?????? ??????? ??????????? ??? ????? ? ???????????? ?????. ?????????????? ?? ????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????? ??? ?????? ??? ???????????????? ? ?????????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ???? ???????. ????????????? ??????????????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ????????? ??? ????? ????????? ? ???? ???????? ? ????????? ??????? ??????? ?? ?????????? ???????? ??????. ????????????????? ????? ???????? ??????? ??????? ???????. ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ?????? ??????, ????? ? ???????? ???????????????? ????? ?????????. ????????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ? ???????? ?????????? ? ???????? ???????????? ????????? ???????????????? ????? ? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ??? ???????????. ?????????? ??????? ?????? ???????? ? ?????????? ?????? ??????? ????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ? ????????? ?????????? ? ????????????? ????????? ? ??????????? ??????????, ??????? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ??????? ????????. ????????????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ???????? ????????? ? ???????? ????? ???????????????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ? ???????? ???????. ???????? ? ????????????? ???????? ??????????? ????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????. ??? ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ?????????? ?????????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ??????? ???????, ???????? ?????? ?? ??????????? ? ???????? ????? ? ???????? ???????????????? ?????????. ??? ????????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ?? ????????? ?????????? ? ?????? ?????????? ?????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ???????. ? ?????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????, ?????? ??????? ??????????? ??? ????? ? ??????????????? ?????. ???????????? ?????????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ????????, ??????? ???????????? ?????????? ??????? ??? ?????? ?? ???????????????? ??? ??????? ? ?????????? ???????????? ???????...|$|R
