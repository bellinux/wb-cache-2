There is also no published complex guide concerning technological aspects of the production of fancy yarns. The elaboration of such guides could be time consuming and probably they would not fit exactly the requirements of rapidly changing industry and end-user demands. The geometry of the effects could {{be considered as a}} classiffing factor. Other factors supporting classification are the tensions of component yarns occurring during the twisting process. Thus we can classify <b>knop</b> <b>yarn</b> as a point effect fancy yarn, and according to the tension changes we rank <b>knop</b> <b>yarn</b> as a subgroup of bunch yarns. In the <b>knop</b> <b>yarn</b> group, the component yarns change their functions during the twisting process periodically {{one of them is the}} core yarn and next it changes the function to become an effect yarn. In this way one may obtain fancy colour effects. The properties of this type of yarn were investigated focussing on changing the twist and frequency of occurring effects using multiple regressions. The most useful seems to prediction of the impact of the <b>knop</b> <b>yarn</b> type of aesthetic of fabrics and their mechanical parameters...|$|E

This operation is known as [...] "doubling".|$|R
