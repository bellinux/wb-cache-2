40|$|Seafood {{consumption}} in the U. S. has increased over the period 1990 to 2003. A {{large percentage of the}} seafood consumed in the U. S. is imported. The most important seafood products imported to the U. S. are shrimp, Atlantic salmon, tilapia, catfish, crayfish, mussels and a mixture of mollusks. In 2003, the U. S. imported 199 million pounds of tilapia and tilapia products, at a value of $ 241. 2 million, a 38 % increase from the previous year. The seafood market has been considered an important foreign exchange earner for the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM), and Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) member countries. Jamaica is the only CARICOM country that exports tilapia products from aquaculture sources to the U. S. In 2003, Jamaica exported 39, 950 pounds of <b>frozen</b> tilapia <b>fillet</b> to the U.

5000|$|In South Africa, hake is {{targeted}} by four distinct fisheries: the offshore and inshore demersal trawl fisheries, and the hake longline and hake handline sectors. The offshore demersal trawl fishery {{is by far}} the biggest of the four. Approximately 84% of the hake total allowable catch (TAC) is allocated to the offshore demersal trawl fishery. The inshore trawl and hake longline fisheries are each allocated approximately 6% of the TAC and the handline fishery presently accounts for about 3% of the allocation, although this has not been caught in recent years. [...] Trawling for hake takes place in a near continuous band on well-established grounds that extend from the Namibian border on the west coast to the extreme eastern part of the Agulhas Bank off the south-east coast. [...] Exploitation is predominantly at depths of between 300 to 800m on the west coast and less than 200m on the south coast. [...] The offshore demersal trawl fleet consists of 52 trawlers. Twenty-seven fresh fish trawlers preserve hake on ice and return it to shore for processing, while 18 freezer vessels produce frozen headed and gutted (H&G) hake. Seven more sophisticated freezer trawlers produce <b>frozen</b> <b>fillets</b> at sea [...] The gear configuration consists of “otter trawls” - gear towed along the seabed with trawl doors (or otter boards) keeping the mouth of the net open. Trawlers generally tow their nets at 3.5 knots for one to three hours, mainly in daylight when targeting hake [...] Trawling occurs mainly over sandy sediments, but areas of muddy substrate and coarser, gravely substrates are also trawled [...] A five-year (2014-2019) benthic trawl experiment is currently underway [...] The purpose of the experiment is to determine the environmental impact of demersal trawling in South African waters. It is being implemented by SADSTIA in partnership with the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry & Fisheries, the University of Cape Town, the South African Environmental Observation Network and the South African National Biodiversity Institute. The catch of the offshore demersal trawl sector amounts to approximately 130 000 tonnes per year (2013 catches) [...] although this has varied between 118 and 166 000 tonnes, and consists of approximately 90% M. paradoxus and 10% M. capensis. The main bycatch species are kingklip (Genypterus capensis) and monk (Lophius vomerinus). Trawler owners and operators produce a mix of fresh and frozen products, supplying them to retail and food-service markets both locally and internationally. The main export markets are in Europe, Australia and the United States.|$|E

The competition between fresh and <b>frozen</b> <b>fillets</b> of catfish and tilapia imports in the same market is examined using market integration and demand analysis.

Saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), polyunsaturated (PUFA), omega- 6 (n- 6) and omega- 3 (n- 3) fatty acids were determined by gas chromatograph coupled to mass spectrometry. The results indicated that during frozen storage, SFA and MUFA content increased by 32. 63 and 9. 25 %, respectively, while PUFA content decreased by 25. 3 %, n- 6 by 12. 4 % and n- 3 by 32. 55 %. These changes were more significant (P &# 8804; 0. 05) during the first 45 d of storage. It was concluded that the frozen storage had a negative impact on meat quality of rainbow trout due to the reduction of PUFA, n- 3 /n- 6, polyene index and PUFA/ SFA and the increase of the SFA, and atherogenic and thrombogenic indexes, which meant a substantial loss of nutritional value in the fillets of rainbow trout...|$|E

This helped the fishing industry succeed to an extent that helped create interests in the status quo.

It was politically costly for ruling elites to enforce fisheries management because strict enforcement was unpopular with fishermen, as well as with many fishermen and security agents who benefitted from illegal fishing. Therefore, the success was not maintained: a pocket of efficiency was established with regard to hygiene and testing, but not with regard to enforcing fisheries management. Overfishing and the near collapse of the fishing sector were the results...|$|R
