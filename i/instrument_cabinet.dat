40|$|Background: Infection {{control is}} a key issue in {{podiatry}} {{as it is in}} all forms of clinical practice. Airborne contamination may be particularly important in podiatry due to the generation of particulates during treatment. Consequently, technologies that prevent contamination in podiatry settings may have a useful role. The aims of this investigation were twofold, firstly to determine the ability of a UV cabinet to protect instruments from airborne contamination and secondly to determine its ability to remove microbes from contaminated surfaces and instruments. Method: A UV <b>instrument</b> <b>cabinet</b> was installed in a University podiatry suite. Impact samplers and standard microbiological techniques were used to determine {{the nature and extent of}} microbial airborne contamination. Sterile filters were used to determine the ability of the UV cabinet to protect exposed surfaces. Artificially contaminated instruments were used to determine the ability of the cabinet to remove microbial contamination. Results: Airborne bacterial contamination was dominated by Gram positive cocci including Staphylococcus aureus. Airborne fungal levels were much lower than those observed for bacteria. The UV cabinet significantly reduced (p < 0. 05) the observed levels of airborne contamination. When challenged with contaminated instruments the cabinet was able to reduce microbial levels by between 60...|$|E

The electricity instrument demonstrations tended {{to make a lot}} of noise and distracted the readers of the books in the gallery, and after the mineralogical cabinet was built for the center of the room, demonstrations there became more difficult and a new demonstration and lecture room was built on the north side (today the Print room). This new room shared its purpose with the art gallery but as the number of <b>instrument</b> <b>cabinets</b> increased, was felt to be too dark, leading to the creation of a separate painting gallery in 1838.

40|$|Historical {{studies have}} usually {{separated}} collecting {{in the fine}} arts, where the focus is upon connoisseurs, amateurs and the art market, from that in the sciences, where <b>instruments,</b> <b>cabinets</b> and classificatory schemes have been of central importance. For the Renaissance, {{it has long been}} established that collectors of natural history were a subset of fine art collectors. But narratives of the later eighteenth century are dominated by the rise of the scientific institution, and few studies of natural history collecting outside institutions exist. What did the community of natural history collectors in late Old Regime France in fact collect? Who were these collectors? How did they understand the purpose of collecting itself? These questions, which can be explored using a range of sources including auction catalogues, guidebooks, travel accounts and inventories, take on added significance {{towards the end of the}} Old Regime within debates over the role of nature as the source of lasting and virtuous social order. In this essay, I will argue that an object-based approach to the history of collecting offers new possibilities for understanding natural history collecting as a way of connecting orderly minds and households to new concerns with governance and the nation. At the same time, this approach breaks down anachronistic divisions between ‘scientific’ and ‘amateur’ collecting in natural history, affording a new perspective upon the priorities, practices and approaches of institutional naturalists...|$|R

5000|$|The {{origins of}} the first public {{collection}} are {{closely linked to the}} University of Basel and the early modern era collections of books, art and natural curiosities, of which there were quite a few in Basel. Prominent among them, the Amerbach printer family (founded by Johann Amerbach) had collected a substantial number of books, paintings, goldsmith works, coins and natural objects during the 16th century. In 1661, the Amerbach Cabinet {{was on the verge of}} being disbanded following a purchase offer from Amsterdam, then the European center for the trade in collector’s items. At the urging of the mayor Johann Rudolf Wettstein, the city and university decided to jointly purchase the collection in order to keep it in Basel. Installed in the Haus zur Mücke just off Cathedral Square in 1671, the collection did not operate like a museum. It principally served as a library for university scholars, with only a few parlors on the first floor reserved for works of art and natural objects. Two librarians were in charge of administering the overall collection. Beginning in the late 18th century, Basel saw an acceleration in the growth of collections of books and objects inspired by Enlightenment-era ideals of education and refinement. Significant holdings of antiquities, coins, fossils and natural curiosities made their way into the Haus zur Mücke through purchases, gifts or bequests by private collectors.

40|$|Australia and the UK {{have much}} in common: both have {{relatively}} stable political and economic institutions; both are considered liberal democracies; and both provide support to families through the tax-transfer system. However institutional, political-economic and demographic differences influence the design of that support at particular points in time. This thesis compares and evaluates family support delivered through the tax-transfer system in Australia and the UK from 1972 to 2007, a period {{of economic and social}} transition in both countries. It explores the various policy objectives of the family tax-transfer system in each country over this period; the policy instruments adopted; and the effectiveness of these instruments in achieving their stated policy objectives. The thesis is policy orientated and multidisciplinary, incorporating elements of tax policy, sociology and economics. It is a comparative historical study of the development of the family tax-transfer system in the two countries, based on archival research including government reports, legislative <b>instruments,</b> <b>cabinet</b> minutes, contemporary commentary and reported data. Institutional theory, particularly path dependency theory, is used to trace the historical development of the system in each country and to explore the reasons why policy developments diverged or converged from time to time. A second theoretical lens applied is gender equity, examining the impact of the family tax-transfer system on women as carers of children. The thesis consists of seven chapters. Following the introductory chapter, Chapter 2 establishes the core tax design principles {{in the context of the}} family tax-transfer system. Chapters 3 and 4 trace developments in Australia and the UK respectively between 1972 and 2007. The comparative examination of the two countries in Chapter 5 evaluates the effectiveness of measures in each country, while Chapter 6 draws conclusions as to the reasons for the outcomes of specific measures. Finally the thesis sets out recommendations for reform, drawing on policy lessons from both countries. The analysis finds that delivering family benefits as targeted transfer payments has been redistributive, moderating the impact of less progressive income tax rates, with strategies addressing child poverty most effective when given political priority. To reduce complexity, system design must take account of institutional history and whether one payment can effectively address multiple policy goals...|$|R

2500|$|Modern driver magnets {{are almost}} always {{permanent}} and made of ceramic, ferrite, Alnico, or, more recently, rare earth such as neodymium and samarium cobalt. Electrodynamic drivers were often used in musical <b>instrument</b> amplifier/speaker <b>cabinets</b> well into the 1950s; [...] there were economic savings in those using tube amplifiers as the field coil could, and usually did, do double duty as a power supply choke. A trend in design — due to increases in transportation costs and a desire for smaller, lighter devices (as in many home theater multi-speaker installations) — {{is the use of}} the last instead of heavier ferrite types. Very few manufacturers still produce electrodynamic loudspeakers with electrically powered field coils, as was common in the earliest designs; [...] one of the last is a French firm. When high field-strength permanent magnets became available after WWII, Alnico, an alloy of aluminum, nickel, and cobalt became popular, since it dispensed with the problems of field-coil drivers. Alnico was used almost exclusively until about 1980, despite the embarrassing problem of Alnico magnets being partially degaussed (i.e., demagnetized) by accidental 'pops' or 'clicks' caused by loose connections, especially if used with a high-power amplifier. The damage can be reversed by [...] "recharging" [...] the magnet, but this requires uncommon specialist equipment and knowledge.|$|R
40|$|Hyperspectral imaging {{describes}} {{the technique of}} photographing an object using several well-defined optical bands in a broad spectral range. Using satellite- and aircraft-based instruments, macro-scale hyperspectral imaging is well established for geo-observation with applications in many {{different fields such as}} geology, archaeology and defence. Microscope-based hyperspectral instruments and analysis techniques are successfully employed in bio-medical research. In order to transfer this technique to a non-destructive analysis method of historical documents kept in archives and libraries, a dedicated instrument has been specifically designed by request of the Nationaal Archief (National Archive of the Netherlands). This novel tool provides fully calibrated spectral reflectance data at 70 wavelengths ranging from the near-UV (365 nm) via the visible into the nearinfrared spectral region (1100 nm). Recordings are made over an area of 125 mm x 125 mm, using low-intensity wavelength-tunable light sources, while the temperature and relative humidity in the <b>instrument</b> measurement <b>cabinet</b> are constantly monitored. Even when recording all wavelength bands, a document is exposed for less than 15 minutes and analysis can be subsequently carried out using the digital dataset at any time for various purposes.

5000|$|Keyboard amps with an XLR mic input, {{preamplifier}} and a multichannel mixer are {{in effect}} small combo PA systems. While small combo keyboard amps with mic inputs became widely available {{on the market in}} the 2000s (decade), and were promoted as an innovation, in fact, the first portable PA systems sold in the 1920s and 1930s were [...] "combo" [...] systems, in which a power amplifier and speaker were combined in a single wooden <b>cabinet.</b> <b>Instrument</b> amplifiers from the 1950s and 1960s still sometimes included inputs for microphones, as few portable PA systems were available for garage bands during this era.

The speakers were typically connected to the amp-mixer with speaker cables. By providing separate speakers, this enabled bands to elevate the speakers and place them at either side of the stage, which improved sound dispersion over the former approach of using instrument amplifiers to boost both instrument and vocal sounds.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a virtual studio environment to support collaborative working in the domain of building design. By applying and extending the real-world design studio model within the Internet-based distributed computing environments, the virtual studio concept has been refined as computerised settings, which integrate both the dispersed human designers and the distributed CAD applications. The hope is to achieve the similar effect as physical co-presence while providing extra advantages such as the support for automatic communication archiving and being less obtrusive than sharing a physical office. Like its real-world counterpart (which usually consists of the office, desks, file <b>cabinets,</b> <b>instruments</b> etc), such a virtual studio consists of the several major components, including a multi-user graphical user interface displaying the shared virtual workspace on each designer's workstation, distributed multimedia databases and CAD tools for processing the domain tasks, and rich human-human interaction facilities supporting a variety of communication modes. Advance distributed object computing technologies (0 MG CORBA in particular) have been adopted for modelling and implementing the distributed systems, W 3 (world-wide-web) technologies have also been exploited for constructing the distributed multi-media databases and an image communication kit. In contrast to the traditional CAD integration which is usually focused solely on the well-structured technical part of the product and process, the described research advocates a human-centred systems development strategy in which design is first of all taken as a process of social construction. ...|$|R
