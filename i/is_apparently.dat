5|$|The {{approximate}} {{ratios of}} periods of adjacent orbits are (proceeding outward): 1:20, 1:3, 1:6, 1:20. The nearly 1:3 ratio between 55 Cancri b and c <b>is</b> <b>apparently</b> a near resonance, {{rather than a}} genuine mean motion resonance.|$|E
5|$|Bond investigates North Korean Colonel Tan-Sun Moon, who is {{illegally}} trading African conflict diamonds for weapons. Moon <b>is</b> <b>apparently</b> {{killed and}} Bond is captured and tortured for 14 months, {{after which he}} is exchanged for Zao, Moon's assistant. Despite being suspended on his return, he decides to complete his mission and tracks down Zao to a gene therapy clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring. Zao escapes, but the trail leads to British billionaire Gustav Graves.|$|E
5|$|Euryoryzomys emmonsae, {{also known}} as Emmons's Rice Rat or Emmons's oryzomys, is a rodent from the Amazon {{rainforest}} of Brazil in the genus Euryoryzomys of the family Cricetidae. Initially misidentified as E.macconnelli or E.nitidus, it was formally described in 1998. A rainforest species, it may be scansorial, climbing but also spending time on the ground. It occurs only in a limited area south of the Amazon River {{in the state of}} Pará, a distribution that <b>is</b> <b>apparently</b> unique among the muroid rodents of the region.|$|E

5|$|Galvis {{struggled}} off {{the field}} after his injury in 2012, noting that he only emerged from the covers of his bed to answer the door for takeout food, namely Chinese food, pizza, and cheesesteaks. Since then, he has started a daily therapeutic routine aimed at preventing future injuries, to which he <b>is</b> <b>apparently</b> susceptible after his first back injury. His hobbies include relaxing at the beach and playing basketball. Galvis married his wife, Anna, in 2013, and {{is the father of}} two girls named Anastasia and Nicole.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are EF0 and EF1 (T0 through T3) tornadoes. The rate of {{occurrence}} drops off quickly with increasing strength—less than 1% are violent tornadoes (EF4, T8 or stronger). Outside Tornado Alley, and North America in general, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This <b>is</b> <b>apparently</b> mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Mallards {{frequently}} interbreed {{with their}} closest {{relatives in the}} genus Anas, such as the American black duck, and also with species more distantly related, such as the northern pintail, leading to various hybrids that may be fully fertile. This is quite unusual among such different species, and <b>is</b> <b>apparently</b> because the mallard evolved very rapidly and recently, during the Late Pleistocene. The distinct lineages of this radiation are usually kept separate due to non-overlapping ranges and behavioural cues, but have not yet {{reached the point where}} they are fully genetically incompatible. Mallards and their domesticated conspecifics are also fully inter-fertile.|$|E

5|$|The {{hooded pitohui}} {{is found in}} forests from sea-level up to , but is most common in hills and low mountains. A social bird, it lives in family groups and {{frequently}} joins and even leads mixed-species foraging flocks. The diet {{is made up of}} fruits, seeds and invertebrates. This species <b>is</b> <b>apparently</b> a cooperative breeder, with family groups helping to protect the nest and feed the young. The hooded pitohui is common and not at risk of extinction.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} meaning of Ely's name have always been {{regarded}} as obscure by place-name scholars, and are still disputed. The earliest record of the name is in the Latin text of Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, where Bede wrote Elge. This <b>is</b> <b>apparently</b> not a Latin name, and subsequent Latin texts nearly all used the forms Elia, Eli, or Heli with inorganic H-. In Old English charters, and in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the spelling is usually Elig.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the installment, an unborn child <b>is</b> <b>apparently</b> abducted from its mother's womb by a demon after the prospective parents discover that their child has birth defects. After Agent Spender dismisses the assignment as irrelevant to the X-Files, Mulder and Scully steal the case and investigate the creature. While looking into the report, the duo discover that Wayne Weinsider (Campbell) is a child-abducting demon.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a red}} marble step to the chancel end of the {{crossing}}. The crossing has a chamfered north east angle for a tower stair, with a door at the foot. Two small windows {{light the}} staircase to the ringing chamber. There is a complex oak roof in nine panels with heavy beams and pendant bosses. The corner panels have fan vaulting on corbels, the other outer panels slope and the centre has a moulded roundel. There is a small plug in the centre, which, when removed, allows observers in the bell ringing chamber to view the crossing. The massive arches, supporting the equally monumental tower, <b>is</b> <b>apparently</b> early thirteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Tremble {{arrives at}} the Casino Royale {{accompanied}} by Lynd, who foils an attempt to disable him by seductive SMERSH agent Miss Goodthighs. Later that night, Tremble observes Le Chiffre playing at the casino and realises that he is using infrared sunglasses to cheat. Lynd steals the sunglasses, allowing Evelyn to eventually beat Le Chiffre {{in a game of}} baccarat. Lynd <b>is</b> <b>apparently</b> abducted outside the casino, and Tremble is also kidnapped while pursuing her. Le Chiffre, desperate for the winning cheque, hallucinogenically tortures Tremble. Lynd rescues Tremble, only to subsequently kill him. Meanwhile, SMERSH agents raid Le Chiffre's base and kill him.|$|E

5|$|Another area {{of concern}} is California, where {{recovery}} began to fluctuate or decline in the late 1990s. Unusually high mortality rates amongst adult and subadult otters, particularly females, have been reported. In 2017 the US Geological Survey found a 3% drop in the sea otter population of the California coast. This number still keeps them on track for removal from the endangered species list, although just barely. Necropsies of dead sea otters indicate diseases, particularly Toxoplasma gondii and acanthocephalan parasite infections, are major causes of sea otter mortality in California. The Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which is often fatal to sea otters, is carried by wild and domestic cats and may be transmitted by domestic cat droppings flushed into the ocean via sewage systems. Although disease has clearly contributed {{to the deaths of}} many of California's sea otters, it is not known why the California population <b>is</b> <b>apparently</b> more affected by disease than populations in other areas.|$|E
5|$|As far as known, Oryzomys gorgasi has a disjunct {{distribution}} in northwestern South America, including Colombia, Venezuela, and Curaçao. In a 2009 paper, Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales speculated that its distribution may extend into Central America. The Colombian population is {{known from the}} holotype only, caught at Loma Teguerre (7°54'N, 77°W) in Antioquia Department, northwestern Colombia, near the Río Atrato, at about 1m above sea level. The location <b>is</b> <b>apparently</b> a freshwater swamp, and Hershkovitz suggested that O.gorgasi probably occurred throughout the swamp forests in the Río Atrato basin. On Curaçao, it is known from cave faunas at Tafelberg Santa Barbara, Noordkant, Ser'i Kura, and Hermanus. At Tafelberg Santa Barbara, it was found in association with introduced black rats (Rattus rattus), indicating that the population persisted {{at least until the}} first European contact in 1499.|$|E
5|$|As well as hosting Sunderland games, {{the stadium}} has hosted three matches for the England {{national}} football team, {{as well as}} one England under-20 football team match. With an original capacity of 42,000, it was expanded in 2000 to seat 48,707. Its simple design <b>is</b> <b>apparently</b> to allow for redevelopments up to a capacity of 66,000. The attendance record at the Stadium of Light is 48,353 set on 13 April 2002, when Sunderland played Liverpool with the visitors running out 1–0 winners. Along with hosting football matches, the stadium has played host to performers such as Beyoncé, Rihanna, Oasis, Take That, Kings of Leon and Coldplay. The ground also holds conference and banqueting suites, the Black Cats Bar, and a club shop selling Sunderland merchandise.|$|E
