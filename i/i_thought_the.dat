500|$|The update {{maintains}} {{some traditional}} {{elements of the}} stories, such as the Baker Street address and Holmes's adversary Moriarty. Although {{the events of the}} books are transferred to the present day, some elements are incorporated into the story. For example, Martin Freeman's Watson has returned from military service in Afghanistan. While discussing the fact that the original Watson was invalided home after serving in the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878–80), Gatiss realised that [...] "t is the same war now, <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>The</b> same unwinnable war." ...|$|E
500|$|The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{has also}} been {{described}} as [...] "the ultimate pro-vegetarian film" [...] due to its animal rights themes. In a video essay, film critic Rob Ager describes the irony in humans being slaughtered for meat, putting humans {{in the position of}} being slaughtered like farm animals. Director Tobe Hooper gave up meat while making the film, and said [...] "In a way <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> heart of the film was about meat; it’s about the chain of life and killing sentient beings." ...|$|E
500|$|Howard Blake recalls: [...] "I {{went to a}} {{viewing and}} saw that the film was very profound, with a serious anti-war theme, but a certain amount of 'found' choral music had already been laid in by the editors...I {{explained}} that I loved the film and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> choral/orchestral music worked brilliantly but it was very big and rich and I felt a score would have to emerge from it and be very pure and expressive and quite small — and that I could only hear this in my head as done by strings only." ...|$|E

500|$|Initially {{there was}} {{confusion}} {{as to what}} would happen next. Keith Brown, the race starter, was interviewed briefly by the BBC and alluded {{to the possibility that}} the nine jockeys who noticed and obeyed his recall could be eligible {{to take part in a}} re-run. Several jockeys said that they thought the officials attempting to stop them were actually protestors. Esha Ness's jockey John White said of the latter stages of the race: [...] "I could see there were only a few horses around, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> others had fallen or something." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1937, the Duke and Duchess visited Germany, {{against the}} advice of the British government, and met Hitler at his Obersalzberg retreat. The visit was much publicised by the German media. During the visit the Duke gave full Nazi salutes. In an article for the New York Daily News and Chicago Tribune of 13 December 1966 the Duke wrote that in 1937 Hitler persuaded him [...] "it was in Britain's {{interest}} and in Europe's too, that Germany be encouraged to strike east and smash Communism forever... <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> rest of us could be fence-sitters while the Nazis and the Reds slogged it out." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2006 {{interview}} with CNN-IBN, Madhur Bhandarkar {{said that he}} was preparing to make a film about the fashion industry; he thought the lack of Indian films on this subject prompted him to do so. He said he was fascinated with the industry, the models and their lives outside the ramp walks, saying [...] "I was amazed at the overwhelming attention given to the fashion Industry by the media and the public. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> idea of delving deep into the fashion world was very interesting and intriguing." [...] He was excited about depicting the people behind the ramp because most people are unfamiliar with [...] the fashion world.|$|E

500|$|Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post also praised Ramirez's performance, {{calling her}} [...] "the most genuine character". Although he enjoyed Ramirez's performance, Pascua was {{critical}} {{of the rest of}} the episode, writing: [...] "The funeral wasn't as sad as I thought it would be. There were so many pre-episode pictures up that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> funeral would take up half the show, then it was five minutes and it wasn't sad at all. The core group walked away and Izzie spread the giggles. She laughs at the fact that she has cancer, like this was all some really badly written show. Oh wait, it is." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to an informal study that named him the 'World's Greatest Singer" [...] based on a study of vocal ranges, Rose told Spin in 2014, [...] "If I had to say who <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> best singers were, I'd say first that I don't know there's a definitive answer as in my opinion it's subjective, and second that my focus is primarily rock singers. That said, I enjoy Freddie Mercury, Elvis Presley, Paul McCartney, Dan McCafferty, Janis Joplin, Michael Jackson, Elton John, Roger Daltrey, Don Henley, Jeff Lynne, Johnny Cash, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Scott, Etta James, Fiona Apple, Chrissie Hynde, Stevie Wonder, James Brown and a ton of others (predominantly Seventies rock singers) and would rather hear any of them anytime rather than me!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series creator Chris Carter and {{directed}} by Rob Bowman. Bowman was {{not a fan of}} the episode, saying [...] "The show proved to be much more difficult than I anticipated, and there wasn't enough time to shoot the show properly because we were so close to the Christmas break. I felt extremely pressured and frustrated, although there are things in it I love, particularly the banter between Mulder and Scully. But overall, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> show was very oblique. I don't feel that the characters ever {{knew what was going on}} and I don't think it is all that cool that kids are murdering people. I didn't feel like I was shooting an episode of the X-Files, and I think I let Chris Carter down a bit." ...|$|E

500|$|Sasha {{became aware}} of {{electronic}} dance music in 1988 at The Haçienda, a Manchester dance venue. [...] Drawn to the rough sound of acid house music and the rebellious attitude he associated with it, he visited Manchester weekly and soon moved to nearby Disley. [...] Sasha purchased many jazz records and began to teach himself how to mix. A local DJ at a club Sasha frequented {{announced that he was}} looking for other DJs to travel with him on a regional tour. Sasha volunteered and made his first live appearance in nearby Stockport. Sasha recalled of his debut, [...] "I'd never even touched a Technics: <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> pitch control was the volume, I didn't even know where to plug my headphones in!

500|$|Sparks {{produced}} the album, their first in this genre, {{after it was}} commissioned as a radio musical by Sweden's national broadcasting service, Sveriges Radio. The project was proposed to Sparks by Marie Wennersten of SR Radioteatern, the station's radio drama department. Wennersten had become a Sparks fan after watching the duo perform in Sweden in 2004: [...] "I {{had never seen such}} energy and love from the audience. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> Södra Theatre was going to take off and fly away. I wrote to the Sparks fansite and thanked them for the experience." [...] Wennersten subsequently travelled to Los Angeles as a journalist, to attend and report on another Sparks concert. By that time, the idea of a collaboration had formed in her mind: [...] "I always dreamed of dragging them into the radio world." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{always loved}} going to Ogmore and Southerndown. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> cliffs there {{looked like a}} {{building}} anyway. A building capable of withstanding the roughest weather for hundreds of years. The older they get, the better they look. I wondered {{if it would be}} possible to make a building which had the same qualities as these magnificent cliffs. To do that I needed a lot of stone. Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks; it takes a long time to make and costs a fortune. But in north Wales the historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that no-one wants. This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two hundred years but which wasn't good enough to make roof slates. Over 90% was thrown away. But it was ideal for making walls like the one I had in mind... —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E

500|$|Arjona {{wrote the}} song for his mother, Noemí Morales. She {{told him she}} didn't like it because it make her cry. He said that he [...] "wrote the song {{as a gift for}} my mom in a Mother's Day and two sisters (a couple of years ago) [...] and <b>i</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> idea of {{including}} it on the album was very good". Lyrically, [...] "Mi Novia Se Me Esta Poniendo Vieja" [...] revolves around how a son looks at their mother from a sentimental perspective, with Arjona singing [...] "She loves me either if i gor as a guerrilla, or I won the Nobel Prize for Peace / She does't care if i'm last or first, if i'm going as a conformist or as tenacious." [...] He also said that he never thought to include the song in an album, just as happened with his single [...] "Señora De Las Cuatro Decadas" [...] from Historias back in 1994.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong {{prepared}} {{his famous}} epigram on his own. In a post-flight press conference, {{he said that}} he decided on the words [...] "just prior to leaving the LM [...]" [...] In a 1983 interview in Esquire Magazine, Armstrong explained to George Plimpton: [...] "I always knew there was a good chance of being able to return to Earth, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> chances of a successful touchdown on the moon surface were about even money—fifty–fifty... Most people don't realize how difficult the mission was. So it didn't seem to me there was much point in thinking of something to say if we'd have to abort landing." [...] In 2012, brother Dean Armstrong claimed that Neil had shown him a note with a draft of the line months before the launch, although historian Andrew Chaikin, who had interviewed the astronaut in 1988 for his book A Man on the Moon, disputed that he had ever claimed coming up with the line spontaneously during the mission.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Paul {{established}} the [...] "Ron Paul Channel", an Internet broadcast. Its slogan is [...] "Turn Off Your TV. Turn On the Truth." [...] Speaking about the channel, Paul said, [...] "I {{was at a}} debate one time a couple years ago, where I didn't think I got a fair shake. In a two-hour debate, I had 89 seconds. I thought, maybe there's {{something wrong with the}} media. Maybe they're not covering us fairly. I'm just using it as a pun, but there’s a bit of truth to this. We don't get a fair shake. The people who believe in liberty and limited government don't expect it from the ordinary media." [...] Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, [...] "They don’t sit and watch TV and turn the programs on at seven o'clock to watch us like that – so <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> technology was there. The country is ripe for the continuation of this revolution." ...|$|E

500|$|Later {{they were}} offered {{the use of}} a house by the Paris {{municipal}} authorities. The couple lived at 4 route du Champ d'Entraînement in the Bois de Boulogne, near Neuilly-sur-Seine, for most of the remainder of their lives, essentially living a life of easy retirement. They bought a second house in the country, Moulin de la Tuilerie or [...] "The Mill" [...] in Gif-sur-Yvette, where they soon became close friends of their neighbours, Oswald and Diana Mosley. Years later, Diana Mosley claimed that the Duke and Duchess shared her and her husband's views that Hitler should have been given a free hand to destroy Communism; as the Duke wrote in the New York Daily News of 13 December 1966: [...] "it was in Britain's interest and in Europe's too, that Germany be encouraged to strike east and smash Communism forever... <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> rest of us could be fence-sitters while the Nazis and the Reds slogged it out." ...|$|E
500|$|Series co-creator and {{executive}} producer Weiss praised Clarke's portrayal in the scene saying [...] "Emilia absolutely crushed it. It's one of those weird scenes because it was half shot in Spain, half in Belfast. But largely due to her performance, it works brilliantly." [...] Sackheim, {{the director of the}} episode, noted in an interview, [...] "With the interior, {{there was only one way}} for her to play it, which is, bemused. She's the keeper of the secret. She knows how to extricate herself from this. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> ease with which she delivered the lines was necessary for the audience to feel jeopardy for her and for them to think she was crazy. The sequence outside was all about claiming the throne — or reclaiming the throne." [...] Sackheim also stated, [...] "We wanted to clearly distinguish everything we've seen from the end of the last season and the beginning of this one." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{earlier work}} was deemed [...] "vaguely funky white-soul" [...] and [...] "rock", recent ones have been judged {{to have a}} more reggae, anthemic pop sound, evoking {{comparisons}} to Coldplay. Levine refuses to fit his music into a genre, saying: [...] "There's so much variety in music, it's silly to belong to a specific club and try to sound a certain way". He considers himself an orthodox lyricist sticking to conventional themes, acknowledging: [...] "Romance, love, the lack thereof are still very big themes. I haven't {{figured out a way to}} use everything yet. As a songwriter, I'm still limited to that one thing." [...] He also claims he does not like mincing words, stating in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I was so sick of typical lyrics like 'Ooh, baby' and 'I love you' and all this vague shit. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> more explicit I got without being totally explicit was a nice approach".|$|E
