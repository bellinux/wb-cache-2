40|$|Contaminants of {{emerging}} concern are increasing {{in all the}} ecosystems, due to the unintentional or intentional release into the environment of new molecules/compounds or to a new employment and disposal of complex and potentially polluted matrices. In this respect, the reuse of sludge from wastewater treatment plants in farming soils is recognized as a cost-effective practice to dispose of a byproduct, that, after specific treatments and maturation, can be provided as a fertilizer, rich in organic matter and nutrients (1). On the other hand, due to the uncertainty of its contents not thoroughly tested for safety, sludge can result a possible sink of unknown priority pollutants {{as well as of}} not commonly monitored chemicals, such as nanoparticles (NPs) (2). The latter emerging contaminants are becoming a worldwide problem: nanotechnologies are being gradually more employed in all sectors of technology and innovation, but their effects on living organisms are not yet fully clear and unambiguously interpretable (3). Besides, NPs behavior is poorly estimated in the different environmental matrices, especially in agricultural soils. In such complex matrices, the bioavailability of the different nanomaterials frequently is not predictable, for the tendency of NPs to aggregate, to adsorb/precipitate on solid phase, as well as to be coated by organic molecules (4). In addition, the overall picture of their possible interactions with crop plants and with food chains {{is not at all clear}} (5). In the present work we aimed to investigate the effects of TiO 2 NPs in a sludge amended agricultural soil to evaluate the growth and development of the crop Pisum sativum L. at microcosm scale under long term exposure, possibly miming an environmental occurrence. TiO 2 was spiked in two different concentrations in the form of bulk material or of NPs and by using the two main crystal forms (anatase and rutile), applied singularly or in a mixture of the two. Electron microscopy imaging studies allowed us to visualize internalized NPs in the different sub-cellular compartments of the root tissues and their effects on cell ultrastructure. Synchrotron studies demonstrated that both titanium crystal forms, especially anatase, were taken up and moved to the vascular system. Studies dealing with the possible induction of oxidative stress were performed by in situ histochemical techniques and by biochemical approach. The potential <b>fertilized</b> <b>value</b> of the sludge-amended agricultural soil seemed to have no beneficial effects on the plant, but rather to induce disturbance at different levels for the selected crop. The addition of NPs in the sludge-amended soil marked oxidative damages in P. sativum. This result was more pronounced at the lowest NPs concentration and this fact could be probably related to the low tendency of the diluted NPs suspension to form homo- and heteroaggregates in a complex matrix, with a consequent greater bioavailability. In our experimental system, the most adverse effects on plants were mainly recorded following exposure with anatase crystal form, alone or mixed with rutile as well as in the presence of the corresponding bulk material. These findings rise some reflections on fertilization practices of agricultural soils by treated sludge and on the exploitation of nanomaterials, which safety must be carefully evaluated, in order to establish precise regulation over their use, confinement and environmental disposal...|$|R

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Civil Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Penisula University of TechnologyAgriculture in rural communities of South Africa is negatively affected by the poor quality of soils with low fertility. With limited financial resources, non-commercial farmers {{are not able to}} purchase chemical fertilizers or other products necessary for plant production. Alternatives such as composting of human excreta and animal manure have found favour in many regions of the world for improving soil fertility for sustainable crop production. Human faeces contain nutrients and have potential to be used as fertilizer in agriculture. Faeces should not be regarded as waste, but rather as a product {{that can be used for}} the provision of an affordable agricultural fertilizer. The MobiSan facility is a urine diversion toilet installed at Pooke se bos informal settlement, where the disposal of waste is difficult for number of reasons such as lack of space, inadequate infrastructure and no access roads. However, the lack of safe disposal of desiccated human faeces from MobiSan facility has created a detrimental effect within the settlement that lead to unwanted conditions. The alternative means of reducing the pollution loads within the settlement areas is to look at localized on-site treatment of composting methods that can treat desiccated human faeces from MobiSan facility to meet standards for agricultural applications. Faeces can be treated and stored under controlled process called composting to enhance the nutrients value for plant production. Without composting, human faeces usually have a low initial <b>fertilizing</b> <b>value.</b> Analysis of the studies done in Uganda showed an enhancement of the composted faeces-to-food waste from 78 -litre reactors attained 19 % N, 34 % P and 28 % K; and also E. coli and total coliforms were found lower than the detected value with high temperatures exceeding 50 °C and pH (4. 5 - 8. 7). Given the initial low <b>fertilizing</b> <b>value</b> of human faeces, further treatment method is required to make it suitable for agricultural use. Several methods are used to enhance the fertilizing of human excreta, amongst these is the composting. In this line, three composting methods, namely Co-composting, Skyloo-composting and Bio-process composting were piloted with great importance in the settlement for reasons such as: Low O&M costs, Use of locally available materials, and no energy needed to treat human faeces…The application of the three composting methods could provide the community within the settlement with work opportunities and also improving soil fertility using locally-available fertilizers. The initial characteristics of desiccated human faeces from the MobiSan facility were determined by sampling and testing quality parameters namely pH, Oxygen, temperature, moisture content, Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Faecal coliform and E. coli. The initial results of desiccated human faeces from the MobiSan facility showed a low <b>fertilizing</b> <b>value</b> when compared to previous literature, with values of Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium being respectively 4. 7 %, 3. 4 % and 1. 5 %, while those of E-Coli and Faecal coliform being 5. 9 x 103 cfu/g and 7. 8 x 103 cfu/g respectively. Results on the composted faeces using the Co-composting method were as follows: Nitrogen: 22. 2 %, Phosphorus: 25. 4 %, Potassium: 31. 1 %. Skyloo composting method results were found with Nitrogen: 16. 2 %, Phosphorus: 19. 6 %, Potassium: 15. 2 % and results obtained from Bio-process composting method were: Nitrogen: 25. 3 %, Phosphorus: 28. 6 %, Potassium: 33. 2 %. Results of the study showed that the three composting methods were suitable for treating human faeces from the MobiSan facility. Results indicate that the enhanced <b>fertilizing</b> <b>value</b> and reduction of pathogens in composting process could make the compost safe for agricultural application. Bio-process composting was found to be the most suitable method as it enhanced the <b>fertilizing</b> <b>value</b> of desiccated faeces to 83 % N; 88 % P and 95 % K. The composting process also significantly reduced the concentration of E. coli and Faecal coliforms. Results of this study intended to address the issue for the disposal of desiccated human faeces from MobiSan by assessing the potential of composting in enhancing the <b>fertilizing</b> <b>value</b> of human faeces for agricultural application. Results provided also an understanding of the <b>fertilizing</b> <b>value</b> of human faeces and assisted subsistence farmers (small scale) with valuable knowledge of the <b>fertilizing</b> <b>value</b> of desiccated human faeces from Mobisan and the potential of composting in enhancing it for safe use in agriculture...|$|E

The experiment was conducted {{in the form of a}} small-parcel field trial at ŠZP in Žabčice in the farming year 2012 / 2013. Examined were the effects of seven following variants: 1. unfertilized variant, 2. fertilizer LAD applied in two dose, 3. urea applied in two doses, 4. urea applied in one dose, 5. fertilizer with urease inhibitor UREA Stabil, 6. urea with nitrification inhibitor ALZON 46, 7. combination of fertilizers ALZON 46 and UREA Stabil in ratio 1 : 1.

40|$|The present world energy {{production}} is heavily {{relying on the}} combustion of solid fuels like coals, peat, biomass, municipal solid waste, whereas the share of renewable fuels is anticipated to increase {{in the future to}} mitigate climate change. In Finland, peat and wood are widely used for {{energy production}}. In any case, the combustion of solid fuels results in generation of several types of thermal conversion residues, such as bottom ash, fly ash, and boiler slag. The predominant residue type is determined by the incineration technology applied, while its composition is primarily relevant to the composition of fuels combusted. An extensive research has been conducted on technical suitability of ash for multiple recycling methods. Most of attention was drawn to the recycling of the coal combustion residues, as coal is the primary solid fuel consumed globally. The recycling methods of coal residues include utilization in a cement industry, in concrete manufacturing, and mine backfilling, to name few. Biomass combustion residues were also studied to some extent with forest fertilization, road construction, and road stabilization being the predominant utilization options. Lastly, residues form municipal solid waste incineration attracted more attention recently following the growing number of waste incineration plants globally. The recycling methods of waste incineration residues are the most limited due to its hazardous nature and varying composition, and include, among others, landfill construction, road construction, mine backfilling. In the study, environmental and economic aspects of multiple recycling options of thermal conversion residues generated within a case-study area were studied. The case-study area was South-East Finland. The environmental analysis was performed using an internationally recognized methodology — life cycle assessment. Economic assessment was conducted applying a widely used methodology — cost-benefit analysis. Finally, the results of the analyses were combined to enable easier comparison of the recycling methods. The recycling methods included the use of ash in forest fertilization, road construction, road stabilization, and landfill construction. Ash landfilling was set as a baseline scenario. Quantitative data about the amounts of ash generated and its composition was obtained from companies, their environmental reports, technical reports and other previously published literature. Overall, the amount of ash in the case-study area was 101 700 t. However, the data about 58 400 t of fly ash and 35 100 t of bottom ash and boiler slag were included in the study due to lack of data about leaching of heavy metals in some cases. The recycling methods were modelled according to the scientific studies published previously. Overall, {{the results of the study}} indicated that ash utilization for fertilization and neutralization of 17 600 ha of forest was the most economically beneficial method, which resulted in the net present value increase by 58 % compared to ash landfilling. Regarding the environmental impact, the use of ash in the construction of 11 km of roads was the most attractive method with decreased environmental impact of 13 % compared to ash landfilling. The least preferred method was the use of ash for landfill construction since it only enabled 11 % increase of net present value, while inducing additional 1 % of negative impact on the environment. Therefore, a following recycling route was proposed in the study. Where possible and legally acceptable, recycle fly and bottom ash for forest fertilization, which has strictest requirements out of all studied methods. If the quality of fly ash is not suitable for forest fertilization, then it should be utilized, first, in paved road construction, second, in road stabilization. Bottom ash not suitable for forest fertilization, as well as boiler slag, should be used in landfill construction. Landfilling should only be practiced when recycling by either of the methods is not possible due to legal requirements or there is not enough demand on the market. Current demand on ash and possible changes in the future were assessed in the study. Currently, the area of forest fertilized in the case-study are is only 451 ha, whereas about 17 600 ha of forest could be fertilized with ash generated in the region. Provided that the average forest <b>fertilizing</b> <b>values</b> in Finland are higher and the area treated with fellings is about 40 000 ha, the amount of ash utilized in forest fertilization could be increased. Regarding road construction, no new projects launched by the Center of Economic Development, Transport and the Environment in the case-study area were identified. A potential application can be found in the construction of private roads. However, no centralized data about such projects is available. The use of ash in stabilization of forest roads is not expected to increased in the future with a current downwards trend in the length of forest roads built. Finally, the use of ash in landfill construction is not a promising option due to the reducing number of landfills in operation in Finland. Publishers versio...|$|R

High resolution solid state 31 P and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance were used to characterize this complex and to monitor the structural changes occurring to it during an 8 -week incubation period in a loamy soil. A pot experiment was conducted on the two soils after labelling the available P with 32 PO 4 ions. This experiment allowed for the determination of the agronomic effectiveness of the chitosan-polyphosphate complex compared to polyphosphate and to monocalcium phosphate. Results showed that chitosan immobilized up to 147 mg P kg– 1 as pyrophosphate and hexametaphosphate. This reaction did not involve major structural changes in the pyrophosphate or hexametaphosphate groups nor in the chitosan.

However, sensor calibration is difficult early in the growing season when crops are rapidly growing. Studies were conducted in the United States and Mexico to evaluate procedures to determine the vegetation index of adequately fertilized plants in producer fields without establishing a nitrogen-rich reference area. The virtual-reference concept uses a histogram to characterize and display the sensor data from which the vegetation index of adequately fertilized plants can be identified.

Properly managed, organic farming reduces or eliminates environmental pollution and helps conserve water and soil on the farm. Organic farming system requires significantly greater amount of organic fertilizers input than conventional system. Because of the shortage of organic fertilizers in the arid areas, composting is a way to transform the waste materials left over from agricultural production and processing into a useful resource. Mature compost is an excellent organic fertilizer and soil amendment. The potential of composting to turn on-farm waste material into farm resources makes it an attractive proposition. Composting offers several benefits such as enhance soil fertility and soil health, thereby increase agricultural productivity, improve soil biodiversity, reduce ecological risks and improve environment.

40|$|The multifuncional {{role and}} {{importance}} of organic matter in soil is widely known. It is also known that the organic matter in soil is subjected to microbiological-biochemical processes of transformation, which includes synthesis of humus as well as it’s decomposition -mineralization. Mineralization means transformation-decomposition of organic matter by microbiological processes to mineral products; plant nutrients and water + CO 2 as starting and ending component of photosyntesis. Nutrients are partly plant available with fertilizing effect, partly lost from the soil - leaching in ground water, causing it’s eutrophication, but CO 2 in atmosphere participates in greenhouse effect. Practically, mineralization means decreasing of organic matter content in soil and soil degradation [1, 4]. In natural ecosystems (phytocenoses natural forests and meadows), it is almost a balanced between inflow and consumption of organic matter, while the cultural and anthropogenic soils agrobiocenosis in general, this relationship is disturbed {{that there is a}} disproportion between the inflow and loss [1, 4]. Therefore, various materials that contains organic material (waste, various flotation, sludge, etc.) are often used with more or less success. One of such materials, as well as the potential fertilizer, is carboniferous lake sludge like waste of coal mining sedimented {{at the bottom of the}} lake in huge quantities, which is the subject of our reasearch. The research were conducted to determine its <b>fertilizing</b> efects and <b>value</b> for repairing of physical and chemical properties of soil.

Soil and other laboratory research were conducted using standard methodologies using in soil science, while in the field experiments conducted using the exact field experiments [2]. Investigations were carried out on the culture of maize (Zea Mays) and lasted for one year (2009.). The results are encouraging because there had been a series of positive changes in the soil, yields of above ground mass mass and grain of maize were more than 50 % (50, 2 %) higher compared to the control. The treatment applied lake sludge there was a series of positive changes in physical and chemical properties of soil.

40|$|International audienceAccumulation of {{municipal}} solid wastes, such as household solid waste, can be rated as a harmful, if not critical, pollution problem. However, if these wastes can be composted {{and the end}} product used as soil organic amendment or fertilizer, this may represent one of the alternatives for achieving the goal of ensuring integrated and sustainable waste management. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the nitrogen <b>fertilizing</b> <b>value</b> of household solid waste compost in two soils of Morocco with contrasting properties: a sandy soil and a loamy-clay soil. The compost {{used in this study}} was prepared by aerobic biodegradation using the organic fraction after its separation from the non-compostable materials. A study of nitrogen availability of the compost was carried out in a Soil - Compost - Crop system under greenhouse conditions using lettuce as a test crop. Four increasing compost rates of 0, 10, 20 and 30 tons/ha were applied to the soils. The recommended mineral fertilizer rate by the Agricultural Extension Service for lettuce and its half values constituted additional treatments. The results show a high stock of mineral nitrogen in the loamy-clay soil before crop installation. Unlike the loamy-clay soil, the sandy soil generated a better yield increase and a better response to mineral fertilizers. The effect of compost rate on nitrogen mineralization was significant in the two studied soils. The quantities of mineralized nitrogen of the compost varied between 15 and 24 % of the compost total nitrogen applied to the sandy and the loamy-clay soils during the lettuce growing season. Therefore the use of household solid waste compost as soil amendment constitutes a beneficial alternative in Mediterranean soils because it permits the generation of a high nitrogen <b>fertilizing</b> <b>value...</b>|$|E

Saudi Arabia E-mail: abdelazizj'eda @ hotmail. comOrganic {{farming is}} one of several {{approaches}} to sustainable agriculture. Properly managed, organic farming reduces or eliminates environmental pollution and helps conserve water and soil on the farm. Organic farming systems require significantly greater amounts of organic fertilizers input than conventional systems. Because of the shortage of organic fertilizers in arid areas, composting is a way to transform waste materials left over from agricultural production and processing into a useful resource. Mature compost is an excellent organic fertilizer and soil amendment. The potential of composting to turn on-farm waste material into farm resources makes it an attractive proposition. Composting offers several benefits such as to enhance soil fertility and soil health, thereby increasing agricultural productivity, improving soil biodiversity, reducing ecological risks and improving the environment. Aerobic composting of some agricultural wastes (peanut, wheat straw and palm tree wastes) was carried out to raise its <b>fertilizing</b> <b>value</b> compared with the widely used organic fertilizer, farmyard manure. The influence of composted and non-composted agricultural wastes on the availability of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) in sandy soil, as well as the uptake of these elements by corn plants, was also studied. Results indicated a rapid degradation of palm tree and wheat straw wastes as compared with peanut wastes. The composting process raised the <b>fertilizing</b> <b>value</b> of agricultural wastes as indicated by an increase in nutrient availability. The application of the composted wastes as organic fertilizers to sandy soil increased the content of available N, P and K. Results showed that the application of different composted organic materials increased the dry weight and NPK uptake by corn plants...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the physicochemical properties as well as the fertilizing and crop-yielding value of straw and cellulose manure after a 6 -month storage period. Before field application pH value and contents of dry matter, TC, Corg. and N in cellulose manure were higher than in straw manure. The application of cellulose manure caused an increase in pH and the contents of P and K in the soil. The contents of DM, TC, Corg., as well as N and P in the rye grain collected from a field with cellulose manure were higher than in the rye grain collected from a field with straw manure. It follows that the soil fertilized with the cellulose manure was more conducive to the mineralization and sorption of macroelements assimilable by plants.

40|$|Fly ashes from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), straw (ST) and {{co-combustion}} of wood (CW) {{are here}} analyzed {{with the intent}} of reusing them. Two techniques are assessed, a remediation technique and a solidification/stabilization one. The removal of heavy metals from fly ashes through the electrodialytic process (EDR) has been tried out before. The goal of removing heavy metals has always been the reuse of fly ash, for instance in agricultural fields (BEK). The best removal rates are here summarized and some new results have been added. MSW fly ashes are still too hazardous after treatment to even consider application to the soil. ST ash is the only residue that gets concentrations low enough to be reused, but its <b>fertilizing</b> <b>value</b> might be questioned. An alternative reuse for the three ashes is here preliminary tested, the combination of fly ash with mortar. Fly ashes have been substituted by cement fraction or aggregate fraction.

40|$|Recycling of {{phosphorus}} (P) from {{waste materials}} {{is an important}} approach to develop sustainably an efficient and clean fertilizer for many countries with no phosphorus rock deposits. We evaluated the P <b>fertilizing</b> <b>value</b> of struvite, a precipitate traditionally recovered from waste water treatments. We investigated how the P availability differs between 1) two plant species, Zea mays and Lupinus angustifolius, employing different nutrient acquisition strategies, and 2) two different forms of nitrogen (N) fertilizer: ammonium and nitrate which causes respectively rhizosphere acidification or alkalization. We had a non-fertilized and a with triples-superphosphate (TSP) fertilized controls. Plants were grown on an acidic sand in the greenhouse. Struvite had as high P recovery (P uptake/P applied) as TSP. In both species fertigation with ammonium resulted in a significantly greater P uptake (g/root surface area), but not greater total uptake as plants fertigated with nitrate had greater root surface area. Possibly ammonium uptake resulted in rhizosphere acidification and thereby greater mobilization and uptake of P. We propose that struvite {{can be used as}} a sustainable phosphorus fertilizer on acidic sandy soils...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the valorisation of soil and OMW-intrinsic natural degradation potencies as an alternative for safe agronomic management of raw OMW. The method adopted in this study consists in OMW storage and progressive supply in weekly small doses. In field experiment, results of three years application of crude OMW at relatively high dose (150 m 3 ha - 1 year - 1) reveal no important perturbations as regard to edaphic parameters notably salinity, pH and phenolic content, thus asserting OMW biodegradation in the studied calcareous soil. Besides, plants growth was efficiently raised by OMW inputs. Significant amelioration was obtained notably in term of shoots weight, trunk height and crown circumference (145, 40 and 32 %, respectively). In addition, date palm cellular detoxifying capacities were also evidenced by pots trials. Quantitative and qualitative accumulation of phenolics and their oxidation provide evidence of their protective role against the physiological stress induced by OMW. These results highlight the importance of OMW storage and amendment fractioning for toxicity mitigation. Along with the correct choice of convenient soils notably calcareous ones and tolerant crops such as date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.), this method could constitute an efficient approach for avoiding problems attributed to the uncontrolled disposal of these effluents and efficiently recover their <b>fertilizing</b> <b>value...</b>|$|E
40|$|Where manures {{are spread}} out on the fields, this problem is {{extremely}} important, but where manures are hauled out into the pastures or some pot hole and there burned or left, never to be utilized, weed seeds in manure are of no concern. However, the majority of the farmers do spread the barnyard manures, either fresh or rotted. This is particularly true in the more densely populated regions where manure is appreciated for its <b>fertilizing</b> <b>value,</b> and is therefore used to greatest advantage. Here in the West, especially in the Great Plains region, where the soil does not yet respond very greatly to the application of manure, many farmers do not bother with spreading manure on the fields.

If the results obtained in the working out of this problem are going to assure the farmers that if they follow a certain procedure in the methods of storing manures, after a certain length of time they can spread the same on the fields without the least bit of danger of spreading viable weed seeds, the experiments carried out will have been fully justified...|$|E

In Poland it is still rather unpopular method. The following publication presents the results of 12 years (2004 – 2015) of research and experiments on the use of red Californian earthworm in Wastewater Treatment Plant in Zambrów. Among others, the results of analyzing vermicompost quality were shown concerning selected micro and macro elements, <b>fertilizing</b> <b>value</b> and sanitary condition. Cumulative content of the examined heavy metals was highest in 2004 and reached over 1200 mg - 1 kg s. m., whereas the lowest content of 520 mg - 1 kg s. m. was observed in 2012. The study results indicate that in the entire 12 -year research period vermicompost met the standards for organic-mineral fertilizers, which means it contained over 20 % of organic substance in reference to dry mass and over 1 % of total nitrogen and 0. 5 % of phosphorous in reference to phosphorus pentoxide (P 2 O 5). During the entire research period no living eggs of intestinal parasites Ascaris sp., Trichuris sp., Toxocara sp. and Salmonella bacteria were observed in the vermicompost.

The fertilizing,with NPK fertilizers, which contain no sulphur, served as standard. Sulphur was applied in four grades: 30, 50, 70 and 90 kg/ha of elementary sulphur, while molybdenum was used in one grade,based on 3 kg/ha of sodium molybdate. Contrary to the results obtained {{by the majority of}} the cited investigators, which show a positive effect of sulphur both upon the yield and the chemical composition of alfalfa, primarily as regards the increase of its nitrogen content, our investigations point to an almost opposite conclusion. This is best illustrated by the results concerning yields per years (alfalfa was grown twice in the periods of two years) which are presented in Tables 1, 2 and 3. As regards nitrogen,and phosphorus quantities in alfalfa, the changes are best illustrated by the data in Table 4, which show that there is absolutely no connection between the performed treatments and the phosphorus quantity in the stem and leaf, in contrast to nitrogen where there are such changes.
