40|$|Anthrax {{which is}} caused by Bacillus anthracis is {{typically}} a disease of herbivores. Spores existing in the skin, meat, hair or mouth and nose of animals are transmitted to humans through contact with {{a break in the}} skin, consumption of infected meat or inhalation of spores [1]. Infected uncooked or insufficiently cooked meats cause oropharyngeal and <b>gastrointestinal</b> system (GIS) <b>anthrax.</b> When this infected materials swallowed anthrax spores may cause lesions from the oral cavity to the caecum. The diagnosis of <b>gastrointestinal</b> system (GIS) <b>anthrax</b> is difficult due to insidious clinical progression of the disease and difficulty in the isolation of agent pathogen. Releated symptoms of GIS anthrax are sore throat, neck swelling, diffuculty swallowing, stomach pain, anoreksia, bloody diarrhea, nause, bloody vomiting and fever. Supportive and antibiotic treatments are required. Benzylpenicillin, rifampicin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, imipenem/cilastatin, or vancomycin can be use for treatment, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline may be added to this treat-ment for serious cases.

Herein, we investigated the pathogenesis of GI anthrax in animals orally infected with toxigenic non-encapsulated B. anthracis Sterne strain (pXO 1 + pXO 2 -) spores that resulted in rapid animal death. B. anthracis Sterne induced significant breakdown of intestinal barrier function and led to gut dysbiosis, resulting in systemic dissemination of not only B. anthracis, but also of commensals. Disease progression significantly correlated with the deterioration of innate and T cell functions.

The death toll would have been higher, but the earthquake was preceded by a rumbling noise that gave people time to flee their houses before the main tremor, which consisted of two shocks lasting {{a total of four}} minutes. Fifty people died in Léogâne. The aftermath of the earthquake saw much more death as thousands of slaves escaped in the chaos, the local economy collapsed and 15,000 slaves died in the subsequent famine.

40|$|When swallowed, {{anthrax spores}} may cause lesions from the oral cavity to the cecum. <b>Gastrointestinal</b> <b>anthrax</b> is greatly underreported in rural disease-endemic {{areas of the}} world.

40|$|Ingestion of Bacillus anthracis spores causes <b>gastrointestinal</b> (GI) <b>anthrax.</b> Humoral immune responses, partic-ularly {{immunoglobulin}} A (IgA) –secreting B- 1 cells, play {{a critical}} role in the clearance of GI pathogens. Here, we investigated whether B. anthracis impacts the function of colonic B- 1 cells to establish active infection. GI anthrax led to significant inhibition of immunoglobulins (eg, IgA) and increased expression of program death 1 on B- 1 cells. Furthermore, infection also diminished type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC 2) and their ability to enhance differentiation and immunoglobulin production by secreting interleukin 5 (IL- 5). Such B- 1 –cell and ILC 2 dysfunction is potentially due to cleavage of p 38 and Erk 1 / 2 mitogen-activated protein kinases in these cells. Conversely, mice that survived infection generated neutralizing antibodies via the formation of robust ger-minal center B cells in Peyer’s patches and had restored B- 1 –cell and ILC 2 function. These data may provide additional insight for designing efficacious vaccines and therapeutics against this deadly pathogen.

40|$|The {{principal}} portal for anthrax {{infection in}} natural animal outbreaks is the digestive tract. Enteric exposure to anthrax, which {{is difficult to}} detect or prevent in a timely manner, could be exploited {{as an act of}} terror through contamination of human or animal food. Our group has developed a novel animal model of <b>gastrointestinal</b> (GI) <b>anthrax</b> for evaluation of disease pathogenesis and experimental therapeutics, utilizing vegetative Bacillus anthracis (Sterne strain) administered to A/J mice (a complement-deficient strain) by oral gavage. We hypothesized that a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody (mAb) * that neutralizes the protective antigen (PA) component of B. anthracis lethal toxin (LT) and edema toxin (ET) could be an effective treatment. Although the efficacy of this anti-anthrax PA mAb has been shown in animal models of inhalational anthrax, its activity in GI infection had not yet been ascertained. We hereby demonstrate that passive immunotherapy with anti-anthrax PA mAb, administered {{at the same time as}} gastrointestinal exposure to B. anthracis, prevents lethal sepsis in nearly all cases (> 90 %), while a delay of up to forty-eight hours in treatment still greatly reduces mortality following exposure (65 %). Moreover, passive immunotherapy protects against enteric invasion, associated mucosal injury and subsequent dissemination by gastrointestinal B. anthracis, indicating that it acts to prevent the initial stages of infection. * Expired raxibacumab being cycled off the Strategic National Stockpile; biological activity confirmed by in vitro assay...|$|R
40|$|Background – <b>Gastrointestinal</b> <b>anthrax</b> {{is quite}} rare and often fatal. Here we report the {{clinical}} presentation and outcome of nine patients with this disease. Methods – The medical records of all patients with documented anthrax admitted to our university hospitals from 1975 to 2000 were reviewed. Nine patients {{were found to have}} <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>anthrax.</b> Data regarding {{the clinical presentation}}, incubation period, site of involvement, history of animal contact and/or ingestion of contaminated meat, complications, and clinical outcome of the cases with <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>anthrax</b> were looked for and recorded. Results – There were 7 males and 2 females with an age range of 3 to 70 years. The most important features included upper gastrointestinal bleeding, ascites, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and early mortality in 8 (88 %) patients. The incubation period ranged from 2 to 7 days. Eight patients had history of contact with animals or infected animal products, 4 of whom had ingested raw, uncooked meat of dead sheep as well. One patient presented with acute abdomen mandating laparotomy. Only one patient survived and was discharged after 52 days of intensive care management. Conclusion – <b>Gastrointestinal</b> <b>anthrax,</b> although rare, continues to be a dreadful consequence of consumption of raw or undercooked meat of infected animals.

40|$|Background. Bacillus {{species are}} aerobic or facultative anaerobic, gram-positive, or gram-variable spore-forming rods. They are {{ubiquitous}} {{in the environmental}} sources. Bacillus anthracis may usually cause three forms of anthrax: inhalation, gastrointestinal, and cutaneous. The gastrointestinal (GI) anthrax develops after eating contaminated meat. In this paper we report septic intestinal anthrax. Case Presentation. We report an isolation of Bacillus anthracis from blood culture of patient with intestinal anthrax. Bacillus anthracis was isolated from a blood culture of a 34 -year-old man who {{had a history of}} severe abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever, sweating, and lethargy within 4 to 5 days after eating the meat of domestic goat.

40|$|Anthrax is {{an ancient}} disease caused by the grampositive Bacillus anthracis; recently, it has gained much {{attention}} because of its potential use in biologic warfare. Anthrax infection occurs in three forms: cutaneous, inhalational, and gastrointestinal. The last type results from ingestion of poorly cooked contaminated meat. Intestinal anthrax was widely known in Lebanon in the 1960 s, when a series of> 100 cases were observed in the Bekaa Valley. We describe some of these cases, introduce {{the concept of the}} surgical management of advanced intestinal anthrax, and describe some of the approaches for treatment. Several reports and reviews have recently shed light on anthrax and its cutaneous and pulmonary manifestations, focusing on its threat as a biologic weapon. The third form of the disease, <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>anthrax,</b> has not received as much attention, and the research describing its manifestations is scarce. We report on several cases of intestinal anthrax from 1960 to 1974 in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon, where the consumption of raw or poorly cooked meat is customary. One of the authors (A. Ghossain) treated and operated on all the patients described here. We describe a series of <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>anthrax</b> cases, the reporting of which has become paramount with the current renewed interest in this entity, the scarcity of information in the research on this particular form of anthrax, and the high fatality rate in advanced disease. The cases described in this report were chosen to illustrate the protean manifestations of <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>anthrax.</b> Clinical Manifestations and Surgical Findings In March 1960, an acute and particularly severe abdominal syndrome was recognized in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. The first cases were described in male patients from 4 to 25 years of age with an illness that consisted of three phases. Phase I was marked by fainting spells, asthenia, low-grade fever, and headache. Patients rarely sought medical treatment at this stage because the symptoms were not serious enough.

40|$|Biofilms, {{communities}} of micro-organisms {{attached to a}} surface, are responsible for many chronic diseases and are often associated with environmental reservoirs or lifestyles. Bacillus anthracis is a Gram-positive, endospore-forming bacterium and is the aetiological agent of pulmonary, <b>gastrointestinal</b> and cutaneous <b>anthrax.</b> Anthrax infections {{are part of the}} natural lifecycle of many ruminants in North America, including cattle and bison, and B. anthracis is thought to be a central part of this ecosystem. However, in endemic areas in which humans and livestock interact, chronic cases of cutaneous anthrax are commonly reported. This suggests that biofilms of B. anthracis exist in the environment and are part of the ecology associated with its lifecycle. Currently, there are few data that account for the importance of the biofilm mode of life in B. anthracis, yet biofilms have been characterized in other pathogenic and non-pathogenic Bacillus species, including Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. This study investigated the phenotypic and functional role of biofilms in B. anthracis. The results demonstrate that B. anthracis readily forms biofilms which are inherently resistant to commonly prescribed antibiotics, and that antibiotic resistance is not solely the function of sporulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{community has been}} restricted {{by the lack of}} a practical and informative animal model of gastrointestinal infection with vegetative Bacillus anthracis. We herein report the development of a murine model of <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>anthrax</b> infection by gavage of vegetative Sterne strain of Bacillus anthracis into the complement-deficient A/J mouse strain. Mice infected in this manner developed lethal infections in a dose-dependent manner and died 30 h- 5 d following gavage. Histological findings were consistent with penetration and growth of the bacilli within the intestinal villi, with subsequent dissemination into major organs including the spleen, liver, kidney and lung. Blood cultures confirmed anthrax bacteremia in all moribund animals, with approximately 1 / 3 showing co-infection with commensal enteric organisms. However, no evidence of immune activation was observed during infection. Time-course experiments revealed early compromise of the intestinal epithelium, characterized by villus blunting and ulceration in the ileum and jejunum. A decrease in body temperature was most predictive of near-term lethality.

40|$|Bacillus anthracis causes three {{forms of}} anthrax: inhalational, gastrointestinal, and cutaneous. Anthrax is {{characterized}} by both toxemia, which is caused by secretion of immunomodulating toxins (lethal toxin and edema toxin), and septicemia, which is associated with bacterial encapsulation. Here we report that, contrary to the current view of B. anthracis pathogenesis, B. anthracis spores germinate and establish infections at the initial site of inoculation in both inhalational and cutaneous infections without needing to be transported to draining lymph nodes, and that inhaled spores establish initial infection in nasal-associated lymphoid tissues. Furthermore, we found that Peyer’s patches in the mouse intestine are the primary site of bacterial growth after intragastric inoculation, thus establishing an animal model of <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>anthrax.</b> All routes of infection progressed to the draining lymph nodes, spleen, lungs, and ultimately the blood.

40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that herbivores acquire <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>anthrax</b> by ingesting spores, hence information on foraging behaviour of ungulates {{can be a}} fundamental component in understanding epidemiology of anthrax. This study investigated seasonal foraging behaviour {{in relation to the}} timing of anthrax mortalities in zebras (wet season, anthrax peak) and elephants (dry season, anthrax peak) in Etosha National Park. Zebra diet composition and foraging efficiency was determined using video playbacks of focal animals and elephant diet quality and soil ingestion was studied using faecal analysis. The results show that zebras forage more intensively in the wet season, taking on average 3. 5 bites per step in wet season versus 1. 8 bites in the dry season. Nineteen grass species and six shrub species were consumed by zebras in the study areas (Okaukuejo and Halali) plains and zebras tended to eat short grass species in the wet season and tall grass species in the dry season.

40|$|History Anthrax {{has been}} known since ancient times. Besides some {{references}} in the Old Testament, {{there is evidence of}} plagues in ancient Egypt, as well as descriptions of the disease by the Roman poet Virgil. Etiology Anthrax is caused by Bacillus anthracis, unmovable, aerobic, gram-positive rods. It forms spores, which can survive for years in the environment. Pathogenesis Capsular polypeptide and anthrax toxin are the principal virulence factors of Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax toxin consists of three proteins called protective antigen, edema factor, and lethal factor. It is thought that the inflammatory mediator - lethal factor is stored within the macrophage during the early stage of infection. It is rapidly released in large amounts into the blood stream and once the threshold for lysis is reached, it may be the cause of sudden death. Epidemiology Grass-eating animals are usually infected by the bacilli from grass and ground. The disease is transmitted to people by contact with the sick animals or their products, such as wool skin, meat etc. Clinical features Two clinical forms exist: outer cutaneous and inner, including inhalation and <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>anthrax.</b> While cutaneous anthrax is easily cured, the inner forms have high mortality rates. Diagnosis and differential diagnosis The diagnosis is easily established in cutaneous cases, characterized by black eschar. Severe intoxication and collapse during the course of bronchopneumonia or hemorrhagic enteritis should arise suspicion of anthrax. Therapy Hospitalization of patients is mandatory. Bacillus anthracis is susceptible to a number of antibiotics, including penicillin, erythromycin tetracyclines, cephalosporins etc. Prevention General veterinary prevention including vaccination of livestock and control of products is very important. The vaccine consists of anthrax bacillus that is attenuated. The endangered population, such as animal workers and military personnel should be vaccinated. Annual schedule of booster immunization must be maintained. Anthrax as a biological weapon Anthrax has been developed as {{a weapon of mass destruction}} since World War I. During accidental release from a biological warfare factory in the farmer Soviet Union, 68 people died. The ease of laboratory production and its dissemination via aerosol led to its adoption by terrorists, as shown by recent happenings in the USA.
