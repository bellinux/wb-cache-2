Relationship stress and excessive dependence in relationships increases risk of depression for the person with SCI; supportive relationships are protective.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Robert S. Dietz and {{his colleagues}} first {{identified}} the swell behavior. It was suggested that the cause was mantle upwelling. Later work pointed to tectonic uplift, caused by reheating within the lower lithosphere. However, normal seismic activity beneath the swell, as well as lack of detected heat flow, caused scientists to suggest dynamic topography as the cause, in which {{the motion of the}} hot and buoyant mantle plume supports the high surface topography around the islands.

5|$|One {{special case}} of Maldacena's {{proposal}} says that N=4 super Yang–Mills theory, a gauge theory similar {{in some ways}} to quantum chromodynamics, is equivalent to string theory in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. This result helped clarify the earlier work of 't Hooft on the relationship between string theory and quantum chromodynamics, taking string theory back to its roots as a theory of nuclear physics. Maldacena's results also provided a concrete realization of the holographic principle with <b>important</b> <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> quantum gravity and black hole physics. By the year 2015, Maldacena's paper had become the most highly cited paper in high energy physics with over 10,000 citations. These subsequent articles have provided considerable evidence that the correspondence is correct, although so far it has not been rigorously proved.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} early dinosaurs such as Herrerasaurus and Eoraptor {{therefore}} has <b>important</b> <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> {{the concept of}} dinosaurs as a monophyletic group (a group descended from a common ancestor). The monophyly of dinosaurs was explicitly proposed in the 1970s by Galton and Robert T. Bakker, who {{compiled a list of}} cranial and postcranial synapomorphies (common anatomical traits derived from the common ancestor). Later authors proposed additional synapomorphies. An extensive study of Herrerasaurus by Sereno in 1992 suggested that of these proposed synapomorphies, only one cranial and seven postcranial features were actually derived from a common ancestor, and that the others were attributable to convergent evolution. Sereno's analysis of Herrerasaurus also led him to propose several new dinosaurian synapomorphies.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{response}} of consumers to a gasoline price increase is an extremely <b>important</b> <b>implication</b> <b>for</b> environmental policies {{in order to reduce}} the carbon dioxide emissions associated with climate change. Together with gasoline tax, subsidy policy and regulation of carbon emission levels also play an important role in determining the kinds of vehicle and the long-run improvement in the energy efficiency of vehicles on the Swedish roads. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of gasoline tax on carbon emissions in Sweden. Gasoline demand models are estimated by using time series analysis. We find that short-run gasoline demand is both price and income inelastic. A number of studies have shown that long-run gasoline demand is somewhat inelastic; however, this study shows the opposite. In fact, long-run gasoline demand is very elastic with respect to price and income which has an <b>important</b> <b>implication</b> <b>for</b> policy makers. Moreover, subsidy and regulation are found to have little impact on gasoline consumption while vehicle stock is found not to be statistically significant in affecting gasoline consumption.

The fact that rankings are also said to favour the advantage enjoyed by the 200 best-ranked institutions has <b>important</b> <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> equity.|$|E
