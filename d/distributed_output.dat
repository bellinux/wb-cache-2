40|$|Abstract. A self-stabilizing {{distributed}} protocol {{can recover}} from any state-corrupting fault. A self-stabilizing protocol is called adaptive if its recovery time {{is proportional to}} the number of processors hit by the fault. General adaptive protocols are known for the special case of function computations: these are tasks that map static distributed inputs to static <b>distributed</b> <b>outputs.</b> In reactive <b>distributed</b> systems, input values at each node change on-line, and dynamic <b>distributed</b> <b>outputs</b> are to be generated in response in an on-line fashion. To date, only some specific reactive tasks have had an adaptive implementation. In this paper we outline the first proof that all reactive tasks admit adaptive protocols. The key ingredient of the proof is an algorithm for distributing input values in an adaptive fashion. Our algorithm is optimal, up to a constant factor, in its fault resilience, response time, and recovery time. ...|$|R

The extent to which most amacrine cells integrate synaptic information and <b>distribute</b> their <b>output</b> is poorly understood. Here, we show that single A 17 amacrine cells provide reciprocal feedback inhibition to presynaptic bipolar cells via hundreds of independent microcircuits operating in parallel. The A 17 uses specialized morphological features, biophysical properties, and synaptic mechanisms to isolate feedback microcircuits and maximize its capacity to handle many independent processes.

This is desirable since estimating the asymptotic variance in steady-state simulations presents nontrivial challenges.

Finally the reference trajectory is required to be transmitted to only one or a few agents and no local reference models are employed in the feedback controllers thereby eliminating synchronization of the local reference models.

Previous studies demonstrate two L 5 pyramid types: cortico-cortical (CC) and cortico-subcortical (CS).

Unlike previously described L 5 CC and CS neurons, this new subtype does not project to striatum [cortico-cortical, non-striatal (CC-NS) ] and has distinct morphology, physiology, and visual responses. Monosynaptic rabies tracing reveals that CC neurons preferentially receive input from higher visual areas, while CS neurons receive more input from structures implicated in top-down modulation of brain states. CS neurons are also more direction-selective and prefer faster stimuli than CC neurons. These differences suggest distinct roles as specialized output channels, with CS neurons integrating information and generating responses more relevant to movement control and CC neurons being more important in visual perception...|$|R
