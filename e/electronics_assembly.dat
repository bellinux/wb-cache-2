40|$|Abundant data {{exist on}} the {{short-term}} reliability (i. e. less than 5 years) of lead-free solder joints under single loading conditions. Data on combined loading conditions and long-term reliability is scarce. The lead-free electronics will be deployed in many products that serve markets where long-term (greater than 5 years) is a critical requirement. In many applications, electronics will be subjected to long-term exposure to temperature extremes (high and low), humidity, atmospheric contaminants, and combined thermo-mechanical loading (temperature cycling and vibrations). To assess long-term reliability, an experimental plan includes assessing the interactions among the applications conditions. The interacting influences include the growth of intermetallics at the solder joints due to high temperature exposure, electro-chemical degradation of <b>electronics</b> <b>assemblies</b> due to the exposure to humidity and atmospheric contaminants, formation of tin pest due to extended exposure to low temperature {{and the effects of}} combined thermo-mechanical loading conditions on the <b>electronics</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The test vehicle designs incorporate commercial variations in PCB pad finishes, component lead finishes.
