50|$|Lorraine {{takes him}} to an old mine, and shows him a dark hole {{that leads to a}} caved in lower shaft. She and Hex journey down, and it is {{revealed}} that Lorraine has murdered at least fifteen men. Grabbing a knife, Lorraine tries once more to kill Hex, who punches her and secures Red's body. Lorraine comes to just as Hex reaches the top and kicks down the rope trapping her there. Lorraine first pleads that they can be partners, then tells <b>Hex</b> <b>he</b> can't leave her. Hex says she has plenty of companions whom she knows, then departs. Lorraine trembles as she stares at the dead bodies, the only lamp in the shaft slowly going out, leaving her trapped in the dark.|$|E

He is not seen again until the day after Dumbledore's death, when his 'haughty-looking' father escorts him from Hogwarts before the funeral, implying that he was not supportive of Dumbledore and his policies.

Before the Battle of Hogwarts, he is seen pushing past younger students for the evacuation point rather than staying to fight alongside the D.A.|$|R

50|$|The Hex-like {{machine was}} {{mentioned}} again in Unseen Academicals, as {{constructed by the}} staff of the Higher Energy Magic Building at Brazeneck college, and was given the name Pex. Pex was apparently powered by chickens rather than ants, a technology which was considered superior as the eggs it provided were edible. Adrian Turnipseed was responsible for its construction and maintenance, using various technologies he had learned from Ponder while helping to build the original <b>Hex.</b> However, <b>he</b> had apparently not learned well enough, as a seventy-foot chicken broke out of the Higher Energy Magic Building and demolished much of Pseudopolis, and presumably Pex as well.|$|R
5000|$|Hex is the UU's first {{mainframe}} computer, though {{instead of}} RAM, it {{is powered by}} a waterwheel inside a ram skull, and its mouse is an actual mouse. Its [...] "brain" [...] consists of a series of glass tubes filled with ants, which form its processor, and a beehive in a back room, which constitutes its hard drive. It bears a sticker up front saying that there is an anthill inside (a parody of the advertising slogan [...] "Intel Inside"). Initially just a computer, it has gradually developed more of a personality {{over the course of the}} series. Ponder Stibbons has by default become the person in charge of developing and operating <b>Hex,</b> though <b>he</b> admits that <b>Hex</b> largely develops itself.|$|R
50|$|The active player {{indicates}} which <b>hexes</b> <b>he</b> {{will attack}} before resolving any combat. If combat {{takes place in}} a non-city hex, it is automatically a field battle. A city-hex may have a field battle or a siege depending on the choice of the defending player. Once an attack is indicated at least one combat round must be fought. Between rounds the attacker may attempt to bring up strength points from neighboring hexes to the fight (a 5 or greater including leadership DRM is needed). That unit must be withdrawn from any ongoing combat first (you can withdraw after each round of combat). Thus, forces involved in a particular battle may change from round to round. To illustrate this consider that the French are being attacked by the British in EE7(2) and the Prussians are attacking the French in Lille EE6(2). In round 1, the British fight in EE7(2) and in round 2 the Prussians must fight in EE6(2), but in the next round, the British might withdraw some forces to Prussian-held FF6(2), which will then be available for Prussia in round 2 (assuming the 5 or greater roll succeeds). Round 2 consists of fights in both hexes EE6 and EE7, but now the Prussian siege in Lille is reinforced. This can go on for more rounds until one side is completely eliminated or the battle is broken off. If the attacker stops the fight, the defender (inactive player) can counterattack with the same method (note that in this case, the unsupplied forces of the counterattacking army are not halved). Forces that are adjacent to a battle can participate in the battle without moving to the battle hex - being adjacent is enough.|$|R
5|$|Michael Fassbender is a German-Irish {{actor who}} made his screen debut in the 2001 war drama miniseries Band of Brothers as Burton Christenson. Fassbender {{followed}} this {{with a number of}} television roles including a German motorcycle courier in the drama Hearts and Bones (2001), Guy Fawkes in the miniseries Gunpowder, Treason & Plot (2004), Lt. Harry Colebourn in the film A Bear Named Winnie (2004), and Azazeal in the series <b>Hex</b> (2004–05). <b>He</b> made his film debut playing a Spartan soldier in Zack Snyder's 300 (2007). The following year Fassbender portrayed Irish republican Bobby Sands during the events of the 1981 Irish hunger strike in Steve McQueen's historical drama Hunger. His performance garnered him the Best Actor award at the British Independent Film Awards, and the Irish Film and Television Awards.|$|R
50|$|Combat {{results are}} based on the {{difference}} between the modified die rolls. All differences require retreats, moderate differences require an additional one step of damage, and large differences require a total of two steps of damage. The attacker does not move on a retreat; he is considered to have retreated from the attacked <b>hex</b> to where <b>he</b> began the attack. Large units (generally divisions) may take four steps of damage before being destroyed; smaller units (typically regiments) are destroyed by the first step of damage received.|$|R
50|$|Jonah Hex was {{canceled}} during Crisis on Infinite Earths (in which Jonah also appeared along with Scalphunter {{and other western}} heroes in issue #3, 1985), {{but in the same}} year Jonah moved to a new eighteen-issue series titled Hex, also penned by Michael Fleisher. In a bizarre turn of events, <b>Hex</b> found that <b>he</b> had been transported to the 21st century and became somewhat of a post-apocalyptic warrior, reminiscent of Mad Max. The series had mediocre success in the United States but was critically acclaimed and well received in Great Britain, Italy, Spain, and Japan.|$|R

50|$|The 2-dimensional Arthur Square awakens from a {{dream of}} strange, glowing symbols. He lives with his wife, Arlene Square, and his curious granddaughter <b>Hex,</b> a hexagon. <b>He</b> rushes <b>Hex</b> to school {{and along the way}} they discuss the laws of inheritance: how each new {{generation}} of Flatlanders, beginning with triangles, gains a new side until the shapes become indistinguishable from circles. They also discuss how a citizen's shape affects their job, with triangles performing menial labor and circles ruling Flatland in the priest class. They witness a cruel incident where a Circle Priest arrests a slightly irregular octagon child, prompting Hex to yet again wonder about what happened to her pentagonal parents. Arthur tells her that he will tell her someday, and rushes her off to school.|$|R
50|$|The hex {{works and}} Jack becomes love struck by Isabel, insisting on several script changes {{to give her}} some {{dialogue}} and jokes, ignoring statements from test groups preferring Isabel over him. Jack's affection for Isabel grows and he asks her out on a date, making Isabel forget about the <b>hex.</b> But when <b>he</b> brings her home, she remembers and reverses it back to when she and Aunt Clara cast it. The next day, rather than the events the hex presented, Jack is outraged by the scores he received and takes his anger out on Isabel, who lashes back at him. Ritchie fires her, and she storms off. Rather than be angry at her, Jack is fascinated with Isabel and chases after her, taking all her comments into thought. So, after another great taping (with Isabel getting dialogue), a romance blossoms between the two. But the next day, Jack's former wife Sheila arrives, determined to woo Jack back. Isabel sees this and casts a spell on her making her sign the divorce papers and have her decide to move to Iceland. Jack, thrilled, announces he will be throwing a party at his house celebrating the divorce.|$|R

5000|$|In {{his spare}} time during his working life, he climbed the Cape Peninsula mountains, the Hottentots-Holland mountains, and nearby ranges, {{all of which are}} {{spectacular}} examples of Fynbos, including Peninsula Granite Fynbos, Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos and a number of related biomes. Later, when the railway administration moved to Johannesburg, he continued his explorations {{in various parts of the}} Drakensberg mountains, as well as on visits to Lesotho. On such excursions he collected avidly and sent specimens to Dr Rudolf Marloth. He extended his explorations to other regions as well; for example, while climbing the Cockscomb Mountains in the Winterberg range near Uitenhage he discovered a hitherto unrecognised species of Protea, later named Protea dykei Phill (now seen as a synonym of Protea rupicola). On Matroosberg in the <b>Hex</b> River Mountains, <b>he</b> discovered a new species of [...] "everlasting", flowers that in those days were generally included in the genus Helichrysum. That species was described by Harry Bolus under the name Helichrysum dykei Bolus. The genus has since been split however, and the species has been assigned to another genus, as Syncarpha dykei (Bolus) B. Nord. Dyke's name also appears in the names of Erica dykei L. Bolus (= Erica thodei Gilg) and Lessertia dykei L. Bolus.|$|R
