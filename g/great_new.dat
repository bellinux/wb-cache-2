5|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>New</b> York City Fire of 1845 was {{the last}} of three {{particularly}} devastating fires that affected the heart of Manhattan, the other two occurring in 1776 and 1835. While very destructive, the 1845 fire confirmed the value of building codes restricting wood-frame construction. In 1815, city officials had banned new construction of wood-frame structures in the densest areas of the city. The 1845 fire demonstrated the efficacy of these restrictions, as the progress of the fire was checked when it spread toward areas rebuilt after the 1835 fire with such materials as stone, masonry, and iron roofs and shutters. In spite of general improvements, the 1845 fire prompted public calls for a more proactive stance in fire prevention and firefighting.|$|E

25|$|Two {{events were}} of {{fundamental}} {{importance to the}} development of a unique, Byzantine art. First, the Edict of Milan, issued by the emperors Constantine I and Licinius in 313, allowed for public Christian worship, and led {{to the development of}} a monumental, Christian art. Second, the dedication of Constantinople in 330 created a <b>great</b> <b>new</b> artistic centre for the eastern half of the Empire, and a specifically Christian one. Other artistic traditions flourished in rival cities such as Alexandria, Antioch, and Rome, but it was not until all of these cities had fallen - the first two to the Arabs and Rome to the Goths - that Constantinople established its supremacy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} and post medieval period emerged new castles emerged whose main towers were {{certainly}} never intended as refuges.

Hohenfreyberg was created in the style of a Hohenstaufen hill castle, so it could not be without a bergfried. Today, the two castle ruins {{are one of the most}} important castle groups in Central Europe. The Freybergers probably wanted to create a symbol chivalrous self-consciousness again at the end of the Middle Ages.|$|E

25|$|During his mission, New York City (then {{the area}} at the {{southern}} tip of Manhattan around Wall Street) fell to British forces on September 15 and Washington was forced to retreat to the island's north in Harlem Heights (what is now Morningside Heights). On September 21, a quarter of the lower portion of Manhattan burned in the <b>Great</b> <b>New</b> York Fire of 1776. The fire was later widely thought to have been started by American saboteurs to keep the city from falling into British hands, though Washington and the Congress had already denied this idea. It has also been speculated that the fire was the work of British soldiers acting without orders. In the fire's aftermath, more than 200 American partisans were rounded up by the British.|$|E
