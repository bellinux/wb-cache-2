50|$|Rescue 6 {{is a quick}} {{response}} SUV, used mostly for emergency medical response. Like all other vehicles, this SUV is packed with essential EMS equipment, such as a basic life support ("jump") bag, oxygen equipment, spinal <b>immobilization</b> <b>equipment,</b> a suction unit, and an AED.|$|E
40|$|Economic {{efficiency}} within enterprises {{is represented}} by how maintenance and repair activities are organised and operated, the under repairing <b>equipment’s</b> <b>immobilization</b> time because, by diminishing this factor significant reserve resources {{can be achieved by}} increasing production volume. The management activity shall be responsible to organise cars’ and equipments’ maintenance and repair activities, to apply rules of organisational structure and human resources, established and approved in the company’s organisational chart, measures to improve the information system and relationships between departments and sectors, to improve tracking system and movement of documents and to permanently expand data processing sector. Predictive maintenance is based on monitoring wearing parameters of the key elements or subparts of the fixed assets, by some specific instruments (wearing, vibration, oil analysers) in order for the maintenance interventions to be accomplished before the flaw appears. maintenance, repairing, predictive maintenance, reduced cost...|$|R
50|$|The new Rescue 1 {{is a small}} rapid {{response}} vehicle based on the 2015 Ford Explorer SUV with the police interceptor package, and is equipped for {{rapid response}} to medical emergencies. It contains an EMS jump bag, oxygen, spinal <b>immobilization</b> <b>equipment,</b> a suction unit, and Automated External Defibrillator (AED).|$|E
5000|$|Standard {{equipment}} on each ambulance includes {{some of the}} following: a Zoll cardiac monitor; epinephrine auto-injectors (Epi-Pen); oxygen administered via nasal cannulas; non rebreathing masks and bag valve masks; various length splints; stairchair; oral glucose; sterile gauze bandages and medical tape; blood pressure cuffs; oral suction device. Various <b>immobilization</b> <b>equipment</b> such as backboards, topdecks, KED's are on board each ambulance as well. [...] As well ALS providers carry various medications such as Zofran, Albuterol, Nitroglycerin,Asprin,Morphine,Epinephrine,etc. In addition, 700 has a RAD-57 CO detector, which is invaluable at a medical scene to rule out possible Carbon Monoxide poisoning. The RAD-57 is used to measure CO levels in a patients bloodstream. Again, this tool is unheard of in local EMS agencies.|$|E
5000|$|A long backboard, {{also called}} a long spine board (LSB), is a reinforced, firm surface with several hand and strap holes along its lateral edges. [...] Other <b>immobilization</b> <b>equipment</b> {{consists}} of straps, or cravats, and cervical immobilization devices (CIDs). CIDs, which stabilize {{the neck and}} reduce movement, include a soft or rigid cervical spine immobilization collar, also called a c-collar or neck brace. [...] In addition to the c-collar, commercial head supports or substituted items, such as bulky blankets, rolled towels, or foam head blocks, are placed {{on each side of}} the head and then secured to the backboard with tape. [...] Straps are used to secure the torso (chest and pelvis) and extremities (arms and legs) to the backboard.|$|E
40|$|A {{do-it-yourself}} {{method for}} {{the assembly of}} remote chemical <b>immobilization</b> <b>equipment</b> is described. The dart syringes are basically made up of components from conventional 2, 5 ml capacity disposable plastic syringes. A blow-pipe made of metal, plastic or glass with suitable dimensions {{is used as a}} propelling apparatus for the dart syringe. The accuracy obtain- &# 13; ed over 5 m by practically all people, novices included, makes this technique ideally suited for all caged animals and animals with limited escape range. Further merits accredited to this system were inexpensiveness, wide scope for improvization, simple construction, easy to use, reliability and consistency in operation, gentle impact and minimal tissue damage. Minimal disturbance was invariably caused to the subject animals...|$|E
40|$|Bears will be {{captured}} and handled only for management and research purposes. Valid causes for handling include marking potential problem bears, marking bears for identification by researchers, relocation, destruction, and acquisition of biological samples and measurements. Fully trained staff (Appendix I) will direct all handling and immobilization operations. This {{is to help}} insure proper use of the equipment and drugs, safety for both the bear and its handlers, and provide uniformity in records and biological measurements. The Wildlife Biologist will insure that either formal or informal annual training sessions (Appendix I) are conducted to train Wildlife Branch staff in the correct use of culvert traps, drugs, and <b>immobilization</b> <b>equipment.</b> Staff will be trained to the highest standards on bear handling procedures, biological measurement and sample acquisition, and how to properly complete handling reports. This training will normally be coordinated by the Wildlife Biologist. Highly experienced staff members, specialists, or veterinarians trained and experienced in handling bears will conduct this training. A licensed veterinarian will be retained for prescription and consultation on drugs, t...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Cost Estimate Report is to {{identify}} preliminary capital and operating costs for a facility to immobilize 18. 2 metric tons (nominal) of plutonium as a ceramic in an existing facility at Hanford, the Fuels and Materials Examination Facility (FMEF). The Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF), which is being costed in a separate report will also {{be located in the}} FMEF in this co- location option. The technical engineering data used as the basis for this study is presented in the EIS Data Call Input Report, `Plutonium Immobilization Plant Using Ceramic in Existing Facilities at Hanford. ` The FMEF will require minimal facility modifications to accommodate the Plutonium Immobilization Plant (PIP). Adequate space is available within the FMEF for installation of the immobilization process equipment. Facility HVAC, utility, and support systems exist to support the immobilization operations. Building modifications are primarily the removal of the SAF line (gloveboxes and support equipment) on the 70 ` level and building interior changes. The plutonium <b>immobilization</b> <b>equipment</b> will primarily occupy the 42 ` and 70 ` levels of the FMEF, with the same equipment layout as in the sole occupancy case. The Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility would occupy the 21 ` and O` (Entry) levels. Elements of the FMEF and adjacent Fuel Assembly Area (FAA) that will be shared by PIP and PDCF include shipping and receiving, laboratory, waste handling, security, offices, maintenance shops, SNM storage vault, and utilities. It was assumed that the existing utilities and support systems are adequate or only need minor upgrades to support both the PIP and PDCF. The PIP cost estimate was reconciled with the PDCF cost estimate to confirm the use and costs of shared systems and personnel. The facility design for a 50 metric ton plutonium throughput plant will be used for the 18. 2 metric ton facility. Plutonium conversion operations will operate at the same design rate as the 50 metric ton facility over the 10 year operating period. Some of the process equipment will operate for a shorter period of time and fewer operators will be required. The assumptions, missions, design bases, facility and process descriptions, and accident analyses are the same. Therefore it is assumed that the capital cost for the 18. 2 metric ton facility is identical to that of the 50 metric ton facility. However, the following operating costs will be less: consumable materials, equipment replacement and maintenance labor, employment requirements, and waste generation...|$|E
