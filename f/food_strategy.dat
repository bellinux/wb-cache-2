40|$|Urban <b>food</b> <b>strategies</b> are {{increasingly}} being used as means to address a multitude of challenges presented by food system failings. The use of participatory approaches has become common practice {{in the field of}} urban food systems planning. These approaches are believed to democratize, legitimize and increase effectiveness of addressing challenges. Despite these “promises”, they have also been viewed as problematic for being unbalanced and lacking accountability. This paper sets out to compare the creation and use of new participatory spaces in two initiatives in two European cities in their on-going attempts to formulate urban <b>food</b> <b>strategies</b> through multi-actor processes. This is explored through operationalisation of two key concepts essential to participatory approaches: participation and accountability. As such, the paper addresses how participatory processes for urban <b>food</b> <b>strategies</b> can be conceptualised when policy making involves the interplay of actors, knowledges and spaces. We conclude that within the two cases, ample attention is given to get a cross-section of the types of participants involved, while accountability is an aspect still under-represented. Based on the two cases, we argue that incorporation of accountability in particular will be instrumental in {{the development and implementation of}} more mature urban <b>food</b> <b>strategies.</b> However, it is essential for participatory processes to not completely break from more “traditional” policy processes, at risk of limiting progress in strategy development and deployment...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach – This paper investigates the interrelation between the two trends: healthy eating and organic consumption. The study was undertaken among school food coordinators through a web-based questionnaire in selected Danish public primary schools. <b>Food</b> <b>strategies</b> of “organic” schools were compared to those of “non organic” schools. The questionnaire explored the attitudes, policies/intentions and actions in relation to organic and healthy foods served in the schools. Findings – Results indicate that organic <b>food</b> intervention <b>strategies</b> can be supportive for strategies to increase the healthiness of school eating patterns. Social implications – The municipalities and other public bodies increasingly recognize their responsibility to support sustainable food production methods, such as organic agriculture, by choosing this kind of foods in public institutions.

40|$|The question, 'What has {{led some}} local councils to develop good {{sustainable}} local <b>food</b> <b>strategies</b> and what have these entailed?’ {{came out of the}} “Developing skills, knowledge and attitudes” distilled map and evolved out of a discussion on how a lack of expertise and time for marketing on the part of farmers leads to a lack of awareness among potential consumers.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to certain {{other species of}} the genus, Mesodinium chamaeleon n. sp. can be maintained in culture for short periods only. It captures and ingests flagellates including cryptomonads. The prey is ingested very rapidly into a food vacuole without the cryptomonad flagella being shed and the trichocysts being discharged. The individual food vacuoles subsequently serve as photosynthetic units, each containing the cryptomonad chloroplast, a nucleus, and some mitochondria. The ingested cells are eventually digested. This type of symbiosis differs from other plastid-bearing Mesodinium spp. in retaining ingested cryptomonad cells almost intact. The <b>food</b> <b>strategy</b> of the new species appears to be intermediate between heterotrophic species, such as Mesodinium pulex and Mesodinium pupula, and species with red cryptomonad endosymbionts, such as Mesodinium rubrum.|$|E

With resignation of Dix as leader and the subsequent leadership election, Popham again endorsed Mike Farnworth. However, Farnworth withdrew his nomination and John Horgan {{went on to become}} leader. Horgan re-assigned Popham back to critic on agriculture and food, though he would later add critic role for small business back to her duties.

In May 2015 during the fourth session, and again in May 2016 during the fifth session, she introduced the British Columbia Local Food Act (Bill M-222) which would have established a Food and Agricultural Committee in the legislative assembly, require the committee to establish a Local <b>Food</b> <b>Strategy,</b> and make recommendation for appointments to the Agricultural Land Commission, move the Zone 2 areas of the Agricultural Land Reserve into Zone 1, and re-establish the Ministry of Agriculture's Buy BC marketing program.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{starts from}} {{the observation that}} there are many places for ‘food’ in a city like Basel. On the one hand, there are different departments and offices, such as the Office for Environment and Energy, the Office for Parks and Recreation, or the Office for City Development. All these are implementing policies that define under which conditions food is grown in the city, determine which food initiatives are supported, which actors are seen as relevant, etc. Many of the policies are affecting food only indirectly, and there is no official collaboration on the topic of food between the city departments: the city is lacking an overall <b>food</b> <b>strategy.</b> On the other hand, there is a social movement aiming at ‘food democracy’. Currently, it is very active in getting a <b>food</b> <b>strategy</b> started, but so far the progress has been slow. This social movement {{is an example of a}} bottom-up initiative, with several individual projects joining in one network. Accordingly, the values and goals vary among the members, and it can be questioned how many of those participating in particular projects see themselves as part of a political movement. Thus, we do not only find a high variety of places for food in Basel, but also a number of different values and goals that the involved actors have, be it from the city or the social movement. In the paper we will present first results of a study that analysed the different ways in which the involved actors frame ‘food’. Our hypothesis is that different frames of food inhibit the development of a comprehensive <b>food</b> <b>strategy.</b> The focus of the study is on the tension between a loose network-movement and the engagement of the city in form of a <b>food</b> <b>strategy.</b> It will explore how the movement interacts with the institutions, and what aims the movement has in regard to changing the predominant food governance in Basel. How do they perceive their role in shaping how food is produced and distributed in the city, and in reformulating the relationship between producers, consumers, state and civil society? In so doing, the research will interact directly with the discussion process on a <b>food</b> <b>strategy</b> in Basel. In consequence, the paper will also reflect on the role of research in the triangle of civil society-policy-research...|$|E

30|$|Between {{the many}} aspects we face when {{defining}} an urban <b>food</b> <b>strategy,</b> this article considers {{the assessment of}} the food system sustainability for a given context. This “scanning” step of the actual situation is essential to address any <b>food</b> <b>strategy</b> and monitor its efficacy (Moragues et al. 2013). From the literature we can point out some key aspects that are essential to make a robust food system assessment: the consideration of diverse spheres of food-related issues as well as the involvement of a broad range of stakeholders from public, private and civil society sectors (Moragues et al. 2013); the definition of analytical parameters and research boundaries (Blay-Palmer et al. 2015); the construction of indicators able to measure progress in all the environmental, social and economic dimensions of food sustainability and security (Prosperi et al. 2015). Nevertheless, scientific literature doesn’t seem having dedicated special attention to the implementation of food systems sustainability assessment at an urban scale. Two texts emerge for generally discussing the topic and confronting different examples: What’s cooking in your food system? A guide to community food assessment (Pothukuchi et al. 2002) 3 and Measuring progress towards sustainable food cities: sustainability and food security indicators (Prosperi et al. 2015). 4 From Pothukuchi it comes to light that an assessment can be related to planning in an integrated, participative and progressive way; while Prosperi individuates the “theme-based/goal-oriented framework […] as the most appropriate to cover the variety of elements that constitute the urban food system”.|$|E
