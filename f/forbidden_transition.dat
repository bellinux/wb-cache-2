50|$|Another {{approach}} is to use nuclear transitions driven by collective electron oscillations. The scheme would employ a triad of isomeric states: a long-lived storage state, {{in addition to an}} upper and lower lasing state. The storage state would be energetically close to the short-lived upper lasing state but separated by a <b>forbidden</b> <b>transition</b> involving one quantum unit of spin angular momentum. The graser would be enabled by a very intense optical laser to slosh the electron cloud back and forth and saturate the <b>forbidden</b> <b>transition</b> in the near field of the cloud. The population of the storage state would then be quickly equalized with the upper lasing state whose transition to the lower lasing state would be both spontaneous and stimulated by resonant gamma radiation. A “complete” chart of nuclides likely contains {{a very large number of}} isomeric states, and the existence of such a triad seems likely, but it has yet to be found.|$|E

For example, in a situation where, according to usual approximations (such as the electric-dipole approximation for the interaction with light), the process cannot happen, but {{at a higher level}} of approximation (e.g. magnetic dipole, or, electric quadrupole) the process is allowed but at a much lower rate.|$|E

50|$|Some {{of these}} {{spectral}} lines can be forbidden on the Earth: in fact, collisions between particles can excite ions to metastable states; in a dense gas these ions immediately collide with other particles {{and so they}} de-excite with an allowed transition to an intermediate level, while in the corona it is more probable that this ion remains in its metastable state, until it encounters a photon of the same frequency of the <b>forbidden</b> <b>transition</b> to the lower state. This photon induces the ion to emit with the same frequency by stimulated emission. Forbidden transitions from metastable states are often called as satellite lines.|$|E
5000|$|The {{magnetisation}} and demagnetisation (where not demagnetised thermally) occur through intermediate states [...] {{as shown}} (right).

50|$|The glow stick {{contains}} two chemicals and a suitable dye (sensitizer, or fluorophor). This creates an exothermic reaction. The chemicals inside the plastic tube are {{a mixture of}} the dye and diphenyl oxalate. The chemical in the glass vial is hydrogen peroxide. By mixing the peroxide with the phenyl oxalate ester, a chemical reaction takes place, yielding two moles of phenol and one mole of peroxyacid ester (1,2-dioxetanedione). The peroxyacid decomposes spontaneously to carbon dioxide, releasing energy that excites the dye, which then relaxes by releasing a photon. The wavelength of the photon—the color of the emitted light—depends {{on the structure of}} the dye. The reaction releases energy mostly as light, with very little heat. The {{reason for this is that}} the reverse 2+2 photocycloaddition of 1,2-dioxetanedione is a <b>forbidden</b> <b>transition</b> (it violates Woodward-Hoffmann rules) and cannot proceed through a regular thermal mechanism.|$|E

50|$|However, <b>forbidden</b> <b>transitions</b> {{are allowed}} if {{the centre of}} {{symmetry}} is disrupted, and indeed, such apparently <b>forbidden</b> <b>transitions</b> are then observed in experiments. Disruption of the centre of symmetry occurs for various reasons, such as the Jahn-Teller effect and asymmetric vibrations. Complexes are not perfectly symmetric all the time. Transitions that occur {{as a result of}} an asymmetrical vibration of a molecule are called vibronic transitions, such as those caused by vibronic coupling. Through such asymmetric vibrations, transitions that would theoretically be forbidden, such as a d → d transition, are weakly allowed.|$|R
50|$|This {{equation}} {{is of great}} importance to spectroscopy. In spectroscopy we observe a spectral line if atoms or molecules that {{we are interested in}} going from one state to another. In order for this to be possible, there must be some particles in the first state to undergo the transition. We may find that this condition is fulfilled by finding the fraction of particles in the first state. If it is negligible, the transition is very likely not be observed at the temperature for which the calculation was done. In general, a larger fraction of molecules in the first state means a higher number of transitions to the second state. This gives a stronger spectral line. However, there are other factors that influence the intensity of a spectral line, such as whether it is caused by an allowed or a <b>forbidden</b> <b>transition.</b>|$|E

50|$|Although the {{transitions}} are nominally forbidden, {{there is a}} small probability of their spontaneous occurrence, should an atomic nucleus, atom or molecule be raised to an excited state. More precisely, there is a certain probability that such an excited entity will make a <b>forbidden</b> <b>transition</b> to a lower energy state per unit time; by definition, this probability is much lower than that for any transition permitted or allowed by the selection rules. Therefore, if a state can de-excite via a permitted transition (or otherwise, e.g. via collisions) it will almost certainly do so before any transition occurs via a forbidden route. Nevertheless, most forbidden transitions are only relatively unlikely: states that can only decay in this way (so-called meta-stable states) usually have lifetimes on the order milliseconds to seconds, compared to less than a microsecond for decay via permitted transitions. In some radioactive decay systems, multiple levels of forbiddenness can stretch life times by many orders of magnitude for each additional unit by which the system changes beyond what is most allowed under the selection rules. Such excited states can last years, or even for many billions of years (too long to have been measured).|$|E

These are the so-called <b>forbidden</b> <b>transitions.</b> The transition rate decreases by a factor of about 1000 from one multipole to the next one, so the lowest multipole transitions are most likely to occur.|$|R

This means that it is forbidden for the path to consecutively use two edges forming a pair in F. The study of this problem is motivated by routing in road networks in which <b>forbidden</b> <b>transitions</b> are associated to prohibited turns as well as routing in optical networks with asymmetric nodes, which are nodes where a signal on an ingress port can only reach a subset of egress ports.
