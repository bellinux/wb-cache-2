50|$|Against a <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher,</b> batters tend {{to ground}} out rather than fly out. A <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher’s</b> {{ability to keep}} balls in the infield in turn keeps balls from {{resulting}} in home runs which, according to Hardball Times writer David Gassko, is the strongest benefit of a <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher.</b> When a <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher</b> does allow a pitch to be bat into the air, {{it is likely to}} result in a line drive.|$|R
50|$|In baseball, a <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher</b> (also ground-ball pitcher or groundball pitcher) {{is a type}} of pitcher {{that has}} a {{tendency}} to induce ground balls from opposing batters. The average <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher</b> has a <b>ground</b> ball rate of at least 50% with extreme <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitchers</b> maintaining a <b>ground</b> ball rate of around 55%. <b>Pitchers</b> with a <b>ground</b> ball rate lower than 50% may be classified as flyball pitchers or as pitchers who exhibit the tendencies of both ground ball and fly ball <b>pitchers.</b> <b>Ground</b> ball <b>pitchers</b> rely on pitches that are low in the strike zone with substantial downward movement, such as splitters and sinker balls.|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{fly ball}} <b>pitchers,</b> <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitchers</b> {{generally}} allow fewer extra base hits yet more total hits. Likewise, <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitchers</b> tend {{to give up}} fewer home runs than fly ball pitchers.Ground ball pitchers tend to perform better against ground ball hitters than they perform against fly ball hitters.|$|R
50|$|With runners on base, <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitchers</b> often force double plays {{because the}} weak contact batters make with a <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher’s</b> pitches {{prevents}} {{the ball from}} passing the infield defense.|$|R
50|$|Povse is a <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher.</b>|$|R
50|$|Baseball {{analysts and}} sabermetricians Tom Tango, Mitchel Lichtman, and Andrew Dolphin agree that <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitchers</b> are {{generally}} better pitchers {{than those with}} fly ball tendencies. Meanwhile, baseball writer and analyst Bill James argues the opposite because of injury patterns among <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitchers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The sinker ball has {{an ability}} to “dive” at the plate, often {{resulting}} in ground balls. Several <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitchers</b> such as Tim Hudson, Greg Maddux, Derek Lowe, Chien-Ming Wang, Brandon Webb, and Jake Westbrook rely heavily on their sinker pitches and may often be considered sinkerballers. Self-proclaimed <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher</b> Zach Day has indicated that his primary pitch is a sinker ball as well.|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{fly ball}} <b>pitchers,</b> <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitchers</b> {{are more likely}} to allow unearned runs. David Gassko notes that 2.23% of ground balls result in an error, and these errors account for 85% of all errors. Accordingly, as Gassko argues, the {{susceptibility}} of ground balls to errors results in more unearned runs.|$|R
50|$|Ground ball rate, {{or ground}} ball {{percentage}}, is {{the percentage of}} batted balls that are hit as ground balls against a <b>pitcher.</b> A typical <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher</b> has a <b>ground</b> ball rate over 50% while an extreme <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher</b> maintains a <b>ground</b> ball rate of 55% or higher. <b>Pitchers</b> with high <b>ground</b> ball rates sustain lower BABIP, or Batting Average against Balls in Play (Hardball), on ground balls than those with low ground ball rates.|$|R

50|$|Harrell is {{an extreme}} <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher,</b> relying on a 91 MPH two-seam fastball. In 2012, he {{averaged}} 57% ground ball outs, ranking in the top 5 in the major leagues. He also throws an upper 80's slider, a curveball and a changeup.|$|R
50|$|In {{his entire}} career from the {{rotation}} to the bullpen, Willoughby was a solid <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher</b> who relied on a sinker ball and a slider, which he consistently threw from a three-quarters arm slot with a high leg lift. Eventually, he used a slow curveball, low and just off {{the outside of the}} plate.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{being an}} {{effective}} <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher,</b> Whalen {{stated that he}} would actively seek the strikeout whenever a two-strike count arose. By not focusing on the strikeout, {{at the suggestion of}} Mississippi Braves pitching coach Dennis Lewallyn, Whalen's strikeouts per nine innings actually rose throughout the 2016 season, and led to his promotion to the major leagues.|$|R
50|$|Torrez is {{regarded}} as a <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher</b> whose best pitch is his fastball, which sits between 90-92 mph. He also throws a slider and a changeup. MLB.com ranked him as the 29th best prospect in the Cubs minor league system entering 2016. Torrez stayed with Myrtle Beach during the 2016 season, where he posted a 2-2 record with a 3.56 ERA.|$|R
5000|$|Diamond-Cam, {{introduced}} at the 2004 All-Star Game, a camera buried four inches in the <b>ground</b> between the <b>pitcher's</b> mound and home plate to provide field-level views of home plate and the pitcher's mound.|$|R
5000|$|Minagawa retired {{at the age}} of 35 with 221 {{wins and}} 139 losses for a winning {{percentage}} of [...]614, in addition to a 2.42 ERA. He allowed a batting average against of just [...]215 while facing 12,552 hitters in 3,158.0 innings of work. A notorious <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher,</b> he was able to induce double plays and provided solid numbers in hits and home runs allowed per nine innings, recording 7.7 H/9 and 0.6 HR/9, respectively.|$|R
25|$|Despite his {{reputation}} as a <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher</b> who worked at an efficient pace, Halladay's strikeout totals increased steadily in the few final years of his career. Halladay's efficiency and durability were reflected in his total innings pitched every year, also due to his ability to strike out hitters and induce ground ball outs to escape jams. He often led the league in innings pitched and complete games, while ranking among the leaders in WHIP and ERA.|$|R
50|$|Pérez {{primarily}} throws three pitches: a sinker, curveball, and changeup. All three offerings have {{a tendency}} to sink. Despite this, during his first season, Pérez gave up more fly balls on the latter two pitches than other pitchers did. During his minor league career, however, Pérez was known as a <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher.</b> Perez has continued to be a ground-ball pitcher at the major-league level, posting a ground-ball rate of 50.9% in 2015, compared to a league-average rate of 45.3%.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ground</b> ball <b>pitchers</b> rely on pitches {{that are}} likely to induce weak contact from the batter, thus {{resulting}} in a ground ball. Pitches that are low in the strike zone with high negative horizontal or vertical movement and high velocity, such as splitters, sinkers, curveballs, and two-seam fastballs, result in the highest percentage of ground balls. According to data from the 2012 major league season, splitters and sinker balls result in the highest percentages of ground balls compared to other pitches, with 50.3% and 49.8%, respectively.|$|R
50|$|In baseball, a sinker or sinking fastball {{is a type}} of fastball pitch {{which has}} {{significant}} downward and horizontal movement and is known for inducing <b>ground</b> balls. <b>Pitchers</b> who use the sinker tend to rely on it heavily and do not need to change pitch speeds as much as other pitchers do because the sinking action induces weak bat contact. Other pitchers normally change pitch speeds to achieve this effect.link refers to one analysts opinion The sinker is much more often used by right-handed pitchers than left-handed pitchers.|$|R
50|$|The stadium {{was thus}} given one final chance to {{close on a}} high note, which it did in Game 3 of the Super Regional played on June 9, 2008, as LSU {{defeated}} UC Irvine 21-7. As {{a result of the}} victory, LSU won the Baton Rouge Super Regional two games to one and advanced to the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. In the final play at the stadium, Tyler Hoechlin hit a <b>grounder</b> to <b>pitcher</b> Anthony Ranaudo, who threw to first baseman Buzzy Haydel for the final out.|$|R
5000|$|After the Triple-A season ended, Foley {{was given}} his {{first taste of}} major league action. He made his debut on September 11, 1978 against the Minnesota Twins. He pinch-hit for {{starting}} catcher Mike Colbern in the ninth inning, <b>grounding</b> out against <b>pitcher</b> Mike Marshall. He played {{in a total of}} 11 games that season, batting [...]353 in 34 at bats.|$|R
50|$|St. Louis Cardinals {{have led}} Major League Baseball in team ground ball/fly ball ratio since 2006. Sinker, cutter, and curveball {{pitchers}} tend {{to produce more}} <b>ground</b> balls, while <b>pitchers</b> who rely on fastballs, sliders, and split-fingered fastballs tend to produce more fly balls. Roughly 10% of fly balls are home runs. Fly ball pitchers in large parks however, tend to allow less than 7%.|$|R
50|$|Tim Hudson {{notes that}} he {{transformed}} from a strikeout <b>pitcher</b> to a <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher</b> because of the capabilities of his sinker ball. He also {{notes that he}} feels double plays are easy to force with a ground ball. As of 1998, 72% of balls put in play against Greg Maddux resulted in ground balls, who often relies on a sinker ball.In June 2002, Lowe allowed eleven fly balls to 129 batters, relying on his sinker to induce ground balls. According to a scouting report by Lewis Shaw, Brandon Webb’s sinker possesses heavy downward movement and high velocity, {{and one of his}} notable tendencies is to induce ground balls from right-handed hitters.|$|R
50|$|Removing unearned runs in calculating ERA may {{be useful}} if they are {{unrelated}} to pitcher performance, but Wright concludes that fielding errors are somewhat dependent on a pitcher's style. Because errors occur most often on <b>ground</b> balls, <b>pitchers</b> with high strikeout rates who give up fly balls are likely to give up fewer unearned runs than groundball control-type pitchers. For example, Ron Guidry—a flyball power pitcher—and Tommy John—a groundball control pitcher—were teammates on the Yankees from 1979 to 1982, supported by the same defense. During that period, 13.7% of John's runs allowed were unearned, compared to 9.8% of Guidry's. Wright concludes that this difference is attributable to their pitching styles, and thus, that unearned runs are partially attributable to the pitcher.|$|R
5000|$|When St. Louis Cardinals shortstop Édgar Rentería <b>grounded</b> back to <b>pitcher</b> Keith Foulke, who trotted toward {{first base}} and underhanded {{the ball to}} Mientkiewicz to {{complete}} Boston's four game sweep of the World Series, Mientkiewicz kept the ball, as dictated by baseball tradition. As Boston had not won a World Series in 86 years, the ball symbolized {{the end of the}} so-called [...] "Curse of the Bambino", and was of considerable interest to memorabilia collectors.|$|R
50|$|During the 2005 NLCS, {{a series}} of contested calls brought fans and sports writers to wonder again whether instant replay {{would be a good}} move for Major League Baseball. For Gibson's part, he didn't see a ball hit off of Mark Grudzielanek's foot while he was still in the box, which would have been a foul ball. Instead, Grudzielanek <b>grounded</b> out to <b>pitcher</b> Roy Oswalt for the first out of the home half of second inning.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{observations}} of cultivated N. lowii by Peter D'Amato and Cliff Dodd showed that these white beads {{were of the}} plant's own production. The substance {{has been described as}} having a sugary taste and [...] "a slightly disagreeable odour". It is unknown why lower pitchers of N. lowii, which are otherwise typical of the genus, also have bristles and produce these white secretions. Charles Clarke suggested that by providing a reward near the <b>ground,</b> the lower <b>pitchers</b> may serve to guide animals towards the upper pitchers.|$|R
50|$|Although Brenly {{was a good}} {{defensive}} catcher, he {{also has}} the dubious distinction of committing 4 errors in one inning while playing as a third baseman during a game on September 14, 1986, against the Atlanta Braves. Three of the errors were on ground balls and one on a throw, with the throwing error coming on the same play {{as one of the}} ground ball errors. Brenly atoned for his mistakes by hitting a fifth-inning home run. He then hit a two-out, two-run single in the seventh inning to tie the game and finally hit a walk-off home run {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning to win the game. Brenly also was playing first base during a Giants-Mets game on September 3, 1986 when Keith Hernandez hit a sharp <b>grounder</b> to <b>pitcher</b> Terry Mulholland. The ball got stuck in Mulholland's glove so Mulholland tossed the glove with the baseball to Brenly for the out.|$|R
5000|$|An outfielder, Schlesinger {{was signed}} by Boston in 1963 out of the University of Cincinnati, where he {{graduated}} {{with a degree in}} education. After hitting 37 home runs, driving in 117 runs, and batting [...]341 in the 1964 Class A New York-Penn League (then a full season circuit), he was protected under the bonus rules of the 1960s on the 1965 Red Sox roster coming out of spring training. In Schlesinger's only MLB appearance, on May 4, he batted for Boston pitcher Dave Morehead in the sixth inning against the Los Angeles Angels at Chavez Ravine. Schlesinger <b>grounded</b> out (<b>pitcher</b> Marcelino López to first baseman Costen Shockley). Boston lost the game, 7-1, one of 100 defeats the BoSox would absorb in 1965. Three days later, when the Red Sox tried to send Schlesinger to the minor leagues, they had to pass him through waivers and he was claimed by the Kansas City Athletics. Thus began the [...] "yo-yo" [...] nature of his career.|$|R
50|$|No baserunning is {{involved}} in the game—the score is kept by keeping track of imaginary runners tagging the bases of a non-existent diamond. Typically, a <b>grounder</b> past the <b>pitcher</b> is a single; if the pitcher fields it before it gets past position, it is an out. Fly balls past the pitcher—unless caught for outs—are doubles, and balls hit to a pre-designated distance are home runs. Triples are agreed upon prior to games. Tournament half-rubber has only singles and home runs, the latter being achieved by hitting the ball 120 feet, or double the distance between batter and pitcher.|$|R
50|$|The Philadelphia Phillies - Florida Marlins game {{began at}} 7:13 p.m. on May 29, 2010, {{to a crowd}} of 25,086 at Sun Life Stadium in Miami. The home plate umpire was Mike DiMuro, the first base umpire was Tim Welke, the second base umpire was Jim Reynolds, and the third base umpire was Bill Welke. Roy Halladay pitched the 20th perfect game in MLB history, {{retiring}} all 27 batters, and allowing no hits, no runs, and no errors. Although he {{is known as a}} <b>ground</b> ball <b>pitcher,</b> he struck out 11, his most of the year and the most by a Phillie pitcher at that point in the season. The opposing pitcher, Josh Johnson, allowed seven hits, one walk, and an unearned run in seven innings. The unearned run came {{in the top of the}} third, when Chase Utley's line drive bounced off the glove of Florida center fielder Cameron Maybin, allowing Wilson Valdez to score from first. This was the deciding factor in the game, for Josh Johnson did not allow another run for the duration of the game.|$|R
5000|$|Pitching for the Houston Colt [...]45s on April 23, 1964 at Colt Stadium, Johnson gave up no hits in a 1-0 loss to {{his former}} team, the Cincinnati Reds. The game's only run was scored {{in the top of}} the ninth after Pete Rose reached second base on an error (by Johnson himself), went to third on a ground-out, and scored on a second error, this one by second baseman Nellie Fox on Vada Pinson's <b>ground</b> ball. Opposing <b>pitcher</b> Joe Nuxhall retired the side in the bottom half to make Johnson a no-hit loser. Johnson still is the only player to ever lose an {{official}} no-hitter by himself.|$|R
50|$|Huckaby was {{involved}} in a collision with shortstop Derek Jeter in the 2003 season opener against the New York Yankees. With Jeter on first base and Jason Giambi at bat, Toronto used an extreme shift that left third base uncovered. Giambi hit a soft <b>grounder</b> to the <b>pitcher,</b> Roy Halladay, who threw to first baseman Carlos Delgado for an out. Jeter, seeing Toronto out of position, rounded second and ran to third. Huckaby ran up the line to cover third and fielded Delgado's throw. Jeter dove headfirst into the bag, while Huckaby attempted to catch the baseball and block Jeter from reaching third. In doing so, Huckaby fell onto Jeter; his shin guard driving into Jeter's shoulder.|$|R
50|$|Swift {{is pictured}} {{in one of}} the most famous {{photographs}} in American sporting history. He was the catcher for the Detroit Tigers on August 19, 1951, when St. Louis Browns owner Bill Veeck sent midget Eddie Gaedel to pinch hit during an actual MLB game. The stunt was inspired by the James Thurber short story You Could Look It Up and Gaedel was allowed to bat when the Browns showed the umpires a legitimate baseball contract. Swift knelt on the <b>ground</b> to receive <b>pitcher</b> Bob Cain's offerings—it is this kneeling stance that is captured in the photo—and Gaedel took a base on balls. He was immediately replaced at first base by a pinch runner and he never appeared in a big league game again; he had had no baseball experience in the first place.|$|R
5000|$|Pitchers who {{throw their}} curveballs with the arm slot {{at an angle}} will throw a curveball that breaks down and toward the pitcher's off-hand. In the most extreme cases the curve will break very wide laterally. Because the slider and the curveball share nearly the same grip and have the same unique {{throwing}} motions, this curveball breaks much like a slider, and is colloquially termed a [...] "slurve." [...] The axis of rotation on a slurve will still {{be more or less}} perpendicular to the flight path of the ball, however it will not be parallel to the <b>ground.</b> With some <b>pitchers,</b> the difference between curveball and other pitches such as slider and slurve, may be difficult to detect or even describe. A less common term for this type of curveball is a 1-7 or 2-8 curve.|$|R
