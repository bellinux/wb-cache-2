40|$|Historically, bridges are {{evaluated}} using allowable stress and load <b>factor</b> <b>rating</b> methods. Load rating made in these traditional methods does {{not correspond to}} any standard and quantifiable measure of safety and the resulting ratings are often quite conservative. The newly emerging AASHTO load & resistance <b>factor</b> <b>rating</b> (LRFR) method can lead to consistent and uniform safety. But its factors are derived from conservative traffic and multiple presence assumptions, and not based on site-specific information (although the LRFR manual does discuss the derivation of live load factors based on WIM data). This paper presents a live load probabilistic model based on site-specific data, which allows the elimination of {{a substantial portion of}} live load effect modeling uncertainty, as well as a substantial portion of structural analysis modeling error. Random occurrence rate of peak loads and Bayesian updating of measurement uncertainties are considered. Gumbel distribution is found to fit the projected maximum live load very well. Sensitivity studies show the projected maximum live load is not sensitive to the threshold strain above which events are recorded, as long as the threshold is sufficiently high. Based on the new live load 2 model, the instrumented bridge is evaluated for specified service period and target reliability. Thi...|$|E
40|$|Current {{techniques}} for rating of horizontally curved composite steel I-girder bridges often use approximate {{methods of analysis}} based on assessment of individual straight girders with altered properties to account for member curvature. This project investigates the behavior and rating of these bridges through load testing with heavy trucks. A five-span continuous two-girder horizontally curved steel I-girder bridge was load tested. Strain and displacement measurements were obtained for the main girders, diaphragms, lateral wind bracing, bearings, composite interaction, and areas of high strain concentrations near stiffener details. Forty-three static tests with different truck load patterns were conducted along with thirteen dynamic tests to assess the bridge response. A linear elastic grillage-based model of the bridge was used to simulate the load patterns. A sensitivity study was carried out based on the tested bridge along with simulations of two other bridges previously tested elsewhere so as to assess the robustness of grillage analysis for use in load rating of horizontally curved steel I-girder bridges.
