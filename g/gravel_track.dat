500|$|The {{church is}} still used for worship by the Church in Wales, {{one of eight}} in a {{combined}} parish, and services are held weekly. [...] It is a Grade II listed building, a national designation given to [...] "buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them", in particular because it {{is considered to be}} [...] "a good essay in a simple Romanesque revival style". The church {{is at the end of}} a <b>gravel</b> <b>track</b> in the countryside of central Anglesey, about [...] from Llangefni, the county town. It is also on a footpath to Plas Penmynydd, once home to Owen Tudor, founder of the Tudor dynasty.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 16 years old, Samiya Yuusf Omar was {{the only}} female athlete {{competing}} for Somalia at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Prior to the competition, she trained at the Mogadishu Stadium on a <b>gravel</b> <b>track</b> pitted by mortar craters. She explained {{that she would be}} routinely harassed while training by local militia groups, fighting in the Somali Civil War, and both friends and family had been pressuring her to stop training. She explained, [...] "Traditionally Somalis view the girls as corrupted if they join in with things like sports and music. It's because they sometimes wear transparent clothes or shorts. Therefore I have been coming under pressure from all different sides." [...] She continued to practice following encouragement from her mother, although had not expected to be chosen for the Games due to her age and as she was from a minority ethnic group.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was tested}} in tether around an {{ornamental}} fountain at the Crystal Palace in South London in June 1875 on a circular rolled <b>gravel</b> <b>track</b> of nearly 300ft (90m) diameter. A first trial churned up the gravel and achieved very little. [...] A wooden deck was then laid over the gravel, {{and a second}} attempt made: [...] Moy later told Octave Chanute {{that it did not}} reach a speed of above 12mph (19km/h) and did not lift off: Moy had calculated that a speed of around 35mph (56km/h) would be necessary. [...] However it is credited with being the first steam-powered aircraft to have left the ground under its own power by the historian Charles Gibbs-Smith.|$|E

40|$|Tourism {{infrastructure}} such {{as walking}} tracks can have {{negative effects on}} vegetation including in mountain regions. In the alpine area around continental Australia's highest mountain, Mt Kosciuszko (2228 m), there is a range of walking <b>tracks</b> (paved, <b>gravel</b> and raised steel mesh surfaces) {{in addition to an}} extensive network of informal/non-hardened tracks. Vegetation characteristics were compared between track types on/under tracks, on the track verge, and in the adjacent native vegetation. For a raised steel mesh walkway {{there was no difference in}} vegetation under the walkway, on the verge, and 3 m away. In contrast, for a non-hardened track there was 35 % bare ground on the track surface but no other detectable impacts. <b>Gravel</b> and paved <b>tracks</b> had distinct verges largely comprising bare ground and exotic species. For non-hardened tracks there was an estimated 270 m 2 of disturbance per km of <b>track.</b> For wide <b>gravel</b> <b>tracks</b> the combined area of bare ground, exotic plants and gravel was estimated as 4290 m 2 per km, while for narrow <b>gravel</b> <b>tracks</b> it was estimated as 2940 m 2 per km. For paved tracks there was around 2680 m 2 per km of damage. In contrast, there was no detectable effect of raised steel mesh walkway on vegetation highlighting some of the benefits of this surface over other track types.

50|$|Mountainboarding, {{also known}} as Dirtboarding, Offroad Boarding, and All-Terrain Boarding (ATB), is a well {{established}} if little-known action sport, derived from snowboarding.

A mountainboard {{is made up of}} components including a deck, bindings to secure the rider to the deck, four wheels with pneumatic tires, and two steering mechanisms known as trucks. Mountainboarders, {{also known as}} riders, ride specifically designed boardercross tracks, slopestyle parks, grass hills, woodlands, <b>gravel</b> <b>tracks,</b> streets, skateparks, ski resorts, BMX courses and mountain bike trails. It is this ability to ride such a variety of terrain that makes mountainboarding different from other board sports.|$|R
