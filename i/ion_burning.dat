Energetic particle charge uncovering effects, viewed as (thermal) core component currents responding to the charge separation caused by large fast ion orbit widths, are further delineated {{in terms of the}} present results. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{implantation}} of semiconductor ma-terials in {{metals and}} alloys essentially extends the capabilities of modifying their superficial proper-ties. However, the use of silicon or other semicon-ductor materials as a cathode in the existing de-signs of ion sources is complicated because of their low electric conductivity. The purpose of the given work was {{the development of a}} cathodic unit of an ion source where not only metals but also nonme-tallic materials can be used as cathode materials to increase the stability of arc-firing and <b>burning.</b> <b>Ion</b> sources such as DIANA, RADUGA, MEVA, etc., are most frequently used for metal and alloy modification by a high-dose ion implantation method.

40|$|The urgent {{quest for}} new energy sources has led {{developed}} countries, representing {{over half of}} the world population, to collaborate on demonstrating the scientific and technological feasibility of magnetic fusion through the construction and operation of ITER. Data on high-Z ions will be important in this quest. Tungsten plasma facing components have the necessary low erosion rates and low tritium retention but the high radiative efficiency of tungsten ions leads to stringent restrictions on the concentration of tungsten <b>ions</b> in the <b>burning</b> plasma. The influx of tungsten to the burning plasma will need to be diagnosed, understood and stringently controlled. Expanded knowledge of the atomic physics of neutral and ionized tungsten will be important to monitor impurity influxes and derive tungsten concentrations. Also, inert gases such as argon and xenon will be used to dissipate the heat flux flowing to the divertor. This article will summarize the spectroscopic diagnostics planned for ITER and outline areas where additional data is needed...|$|R
40|$|Fast ions, {{generated}} by e. g. {{neutral beam injection}} (NBI), radio frequency (RF) heating or nuclear reactions, {{play an important role}} in all large tokamaks. Several issues related to fast <b>ions</b> and <b>burning</b> fusion plasmas are addressed in this thesis. Firstly, a new model of sawtooth oscillations is developed which explains the recent observations that q 0 remains below unity during the entire sawtooth cycle. The model features full reconnection in two current layers and provides a self-consistent description of the plasma states before and after the sawtooth crash. It is applied to the redistribution of fast NBI-ions in JET and comparisons are made with global as well as line-of-sight integrated D-D neutron measurements. Both the new model and the classical Kadomtsev model are found to be in agreement with the measurements. A simplified redistribution model is developed and applied to the redistribution of tritons and thermal ions, again giving reasonable agreement with D-T / D-D neutron measurements. Using a separate method, earlier results on expulsion of NBI-ions are confirmed. Secondly, a numerical study has been carried out of the coupled nonlinear evolution of alpha-particle driven kinetic AlfvÂ?n wave turbulence and associated alpha transport. The saturated fluctuation spectrum consists of two peaks and results from nonlinear ion Compton scattering-induced transfer of energy from longer to shorter wavelengths. An analytical solution of the saturated spectrum, and estimates of the anomalous alpha diffusion coefficient, are given. The final paper addresses the problem of determining whether an initial temperature profile, established by e. g. auxiliary heating, will evolve to thermonuclear burn or quench under the influence of alpha-particle heating and thermal conduction. Explicit burn criteria are presented and the beneficial effects of density and temperature peaking are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the influence of the physical and chemical components of rain affecting air quality in Cuba. Samples were obtained from pollution monitoring stations throughout Cuba. Different chemical analyses including elements and ions were conducted. Meteorological data was also included for the analysis. Results show that the pH was slightly basic for most stations, except those of the eastern region which exhibit pH values below 5. 6. The major anthropogenic sources of <b>ions</b> are the <b>burning</b> of fossil fuel by power plants, cement factories, and nickel-processing industries and the burning of biomass through poor agricultural practices. The western region exhibited increased concentrations of NO 3 - and SO 42 - during the dry season, most likely due to the long-range transport of pollutants from the northeastern United States as well as local pollutants. Marine aerosols clearly influence Cuba’s rain. Only a small fraction of the potentially acidic ions contributes to the free acidity of Cuba’s rainwater, mainly due to the neutralizing capacity of some ions such as Cl-, Na+, Ca+ 2, and NH 4 +. The implementation of abatement techniques for SO 2 and NOX and some elements emissions from major stationary sources will be an effective measure to improve air quality in Cuba...|$|R

40|$|São Paulo in Brazil has {{relatively}} relaxed {{regulations for}} ambient air pollution standards and often experiences high air pollution levels due to emissions of airborne particles from local sources and long-range transport of biomass burning-impacted air masses. In order {{to evaluate the}} sources of particulate air pollution (PM) and related health risks, a year-round sampling was performed for PM 2. 5 (≤[*] 2. 5 [*]μm) and PM 10 (≤[*] 10 [*]μm) in 2014 through intensive (every day sampling in wintertime) and extensive campaigns (once {{a week for the}} whole year) with 24 [*]h of sampling. This year was characterized to have lower average precipitation comparing to meteorological data, and high pollution episodes were observed all year round, with a significant increase of pollution level in the intensive campaign, which was performed during wintertime. Different chemical constituents, such as carbonaceous species, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and derivatives, water-soluble <b>ions</b> and biomass <b>burning</b> tracers were identified in order to evaluate health risks and to apportion sources. The species such as PAHs, inorganic and organic ions and monosaccharides were determined by chromatographic techniques and carbonaceous species by thermal-optical analysis. The associated risks to particulate matter exposure based on PAH concentrations were also assessed, along with indexes such as the benzo[a]pyrene equivalent (BaPE) and lung cancer risk (LCR). High BaPE and LCR were observed in most of the samples, rising to critical values in the wintertime. Also, biomass burning tracers and PAHs were higher in this season, while secondarily formed ions presented low variation throughout the year. Meanwhile, vehicular tracer species were also higher in the intensive campaign suggesting the influence of lower dispersion conditions in that period. Source apportionment was done by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF), which indicated five different factors: road dust, industrial emissions, vehicular exhaust, biomass burning and secondary processes. The results highlighted the contribution of vehicular emissions and the significant input from biomass combustion in wintertime, suggesting that most of the particulate matter is due to local sources, besides the influence of pre-harvest sugarcane burning...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Nord-Pas-de-Calais Region {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{concerned}} areas in France by exceeding of the PM 10 daily mean limit value (50 μg. m- 3). For a better understanding of these phenomena, the most complete identification of PM 10 source is crucial. In this region, numerous studies aiming to the characterization and identification of particles in urban area and in the vicinity of industrial emission have been performed. The objective of this work is to fill the lack of knowledge about the impact of emissions resulting from the marine compartment. It includes natural emissions such as sea salts (Manders et al. 2010) and anthropogenic emissions linked to the marine traffic especially in the English Channel, together with the Strait of Dover, that forms a narrow corridor with one of the greatest concentrations of shipping in the world (EEA, 2013) (700 to 800 vessels sailing per day). The PM 10 sampling and measurement campaign has been performed continuously from 2013 / 01 / 01 to 2014 / 04 / 15 at the Cape Gris Nez, a coastal French site selected to study marine impact, in front of the Straits of Dover. A complementary campaign has been performed in the port of Calais, from 2014 / 01 / 28 to 2014 / 04 / 21. PM 10 levels were measured using MP 101 analyzer and collected using Digitel® DA 80 sampler (30 m 3 /h, 24 h, Pall® QAT-UP filter). The characterization of PM 10 was performed considering trace metals, water soluble <b>ions,</b> EC/OC, biomass <b>burning</b> and biogenic particles organic tracers. These chemical parameters were considered to explain PM 10 levels observed in the Nord Pas-de-Calais Region and to estimate the contribution of the maritime sector to the PM 10 levels in coastal sites. In 2013, at Cape Gris-Nez, PM 10 mean value was 22. 8 μg. m- 3 and is very similar to those observed in several other sites in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. Six species explains about 80 % of the total mass of PM 10 : NO 3 -, OM, SO 42 -, Cl-, Na+, and NH 4 +. Contributions of the different particles types were calculated; sea salts represents 22 % of the total mass of PM 10. Concentration roses were drawn for the 33 studied species. Some elements show identical rose patterns such as V and Ni, known as tracers of fuel combustion, as well as Co, which all point to the North-Sea and the ferries shipping route between France and England. An innovative Constrained Weighted Non Negative Matrix Factorization model developed with the LISIC laboratory has been used (Limem et al. (2014), Kfoury et al. (2016)). This model allows taking a priori knowledge by applying soft constraints on the sources profiles. 10 sources profiles were identified: sea-salts, aged sea-salts, secondary nitrates, secondary sulphates, crustal, biomass combustion, primary biogenic emission, marine traffic, combustion, metal source. The monthly evolution of their contribution evidences different behaviour between the sources: secondary nitrates are predominant during the cold seasons and appears to be the most involved in the PM 10 peaks; Impact of marine traffic is mainly evidenced during the summer season. Study of the contribution roses evidenced that the impact of the marine traffic mainly results from long range transport despite the proximity of the English Channel and the North Sea. For the year 2013, the mean contribution of the different sources were 37 % for sea salts and aged sea-salts, 43 % for the secondary inorganic aerosols, 7 % for biomass combustion, 5 % for marine traffic. This distribution varies highly depending on the period and more particularly during above daily PM 10 limits values...|$|R
