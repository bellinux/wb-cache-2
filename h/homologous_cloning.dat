By using the broad-host-range conjugative plasmid pVA 797, the partially <b>homologous</b> <b>cloning</b> vector pVA 838 was successfully introduced into various strains of Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus cremoris, Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Streptococcus faecalis. Frequencies ranged from 10 (- 2) to 10 (- 6) transconjugants per recipient. Both pVA 797 and pVA 838 were acquired intact, without alteration in functionality. Also, the shuttle vector pSA 3, which shares partial homology with pVA 797, was mobilized via conjugation. The use of S. lactis LM 2301 as the intermediate donor allowed the use of physiologic and metabolic characteristics for recipient differentiation.

40|$|MiR 172 is an {{important}} microRNA that regulates floral development in various plants and downregulates AP 2 family members to relieve the stress on floral determinacy, leading to phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. In this work, PCR with primers designed based on the rice miR 172 sequence was used to isolate two miR 172 -like transcripts from Phalaenopsis hybrida (PhmiR 172 - 1 and PhmiR 172 - 2) that were very similar to Oryza miR 172 d and Arabidopsis miR 172 b. RT-PCR indicated that the levels of these two transcripts were negatively correlated {{with the level of}} the Phalaenopsis AP 2 (PhAP 2) gene in stem, root, pedicel and sepal, and that both were co-expressed with PhAP 2 in young buds. Overproduction of PhmiR 172 - 2 in Arabidopsis led to early flowering.

40|$|The {{halophyte}} Suaeda salsa {{can grow}} in heavy metal-polluted areas along intertidal zones having high salinity. Since phytochelatins can effectively chelate heavy metals, {{it was hypothesized}} that S. salsa possessed a phytochelatin synthase (PCS) gene. In the present study, the cDNA of PCS was obtained from S. salsa (designated as SsPCS) using <b>homologous</b> <b>cloning</b> and the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). A sequence analysis revealed that SsPCS consisted of 1 916 bp nucleotides, encoding a polypeptide of 492 amino acids with one phytochelatin domain and one phytochelatin C domain. A similarity analysis suggested that SsPCS shared up to a 58. 6 % identity with other PCS proteins and clustered with PCS proteins from eudicots. There was a new kind of metal ion sensor motif in its C-terminal domain. The SsPCS transcript was more highly expressed in elongated and fibered roots and stems (P < 0. 05) than in leaves. Lead and mercury exposure significantly enhanced the mRNA expression of SsPCS (P < 0. 05). To the best of our knowledge, SsPCS is the second PCS gene cloned from a halophyte, and it might contain a different metal sensing capability than the first PCS from Thellungiella halophila.

Serological responses as measured by the Farr assay were best augmented by the oil-based adjuvants and saponin. Cell-mediated immunity, as assessed by specific lymphocyte transformation in vitro, was enhanced by all oil-based adjuvants at different intervals after immunization. Results from a challenge infection of immunized cattle with the <b>homologous</b> <b>clone</b> of T. brucei and from neutralization tests indicated that protection against infection was better correlated with specific antibodies than with cell-mediated responses.

40|$|Root-knot {{nematodes}} (RKNs), particularly Meloidogyne incognita, are {{the most}} devastating soil-borne pathogens that significantly affect the production of Prunus spp. fruit. RKN infection is difficult to control and consequently causes massive yield losses each year. However, several germplasms of wild Prunus spp. {{have been shown to}} display resistance to M. incognita. Consequently, both the isolation of novel plant resistance (R) genes and the characterization of their resistance mechanisms are important strategies for future disease control. R proteins require the co-chaperone protein HSP 90 -SGT 1 -RAR 1 to achieve correct folding, maturation, and stabilization. Here, we used <b>homologous</b> <b>cloning</b> to isolate the R gene PsoRPM 2 from the RKN-resistant species Prunus sogdiana. PsoRPM 2 was found to encode a TIR-NB-LRR-type protein and react with significantly elevated PsoRPM 2 expression levels in response to RKN infection. Transient expression assays indicated PsoRPM 2 to be located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Four transgenic tobacco lines that heterologously expressed PsoRPM 2 showed enhanced resistance to M. incognita. Yeast two-hybrid analysis and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis demonstrated that both PsoRAR 1 and PsoRPM 2 interacted with PsoHSP 90 - 1 and PsoSGT 1, but not with one another. These results indicate that the observed PsoRPM 2 -mediated RKN resistance requires both PsoHSP 90 - 1 and PsoSGT 1, further suggesting that PsoRAR 1 plays a functionally redundant role in the HSP 90 -SGT 1 -RAR 1 co-chaperone...|$|E
40|$|The bialaphos {{resistance}} gene, bar, {{was used}} as a selectable marker to isolate the bialaphos production genes (bap) from the Streptomyces viridochromogenes genome. The S. viridochromogenes bar gene was cloned on overlapping restriction fragments using pIJ 680 and pIJ 702 in the bialaphos-sensitive host, S. lividans. Although the restriction endonuclease cleavage map of these fragments was not similar to the bap cluster of S. hygroscopicus, the presence and location of bar and four other bap genes as well as a gene required for the transcriptional activation of the cluster (brpA) was demonstrated by heterologous cloning experiments using a series of previously characterized bialaphos-nonproducing S. hygroscopicus mutants. Since recombination-deficient mutants of streptomycetes have not been isolated, restored function provided by cloned homologous DNA results from both recombination (marker rescue) and complementation in trans. In contrast to our previously reported <b>homologous</b> <b>cloning</b> experiments where we were able to define the position of mutant alleles by recombination, in these heterologous cloning experiments we observed little if any recombination between plasmid-cloned genes and the chromosome. As a result, this approach allowed us to define the location and orientation of functional genes using a genetic complementation test. The organization of the clustered S. viridochromogenes bap genes was indistinguishable from the corresponding S. hygroscopicus mutant alleles. The fact that the S. viridochromogenes transcriptional regulatory gene, brpA, functioned in S. hygroscopicus implied that some transcriptional regulatory signals may also be interchangeable. In these two Streptomyces species, which have considerable nucleotide sequence divergence, the complex biochemical and genetic organization of the bialaphos biosynthetic pathway is conserved. ...|$|E
40|$|Stem rot {{caused by}} Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in many {{important}} dicotyledonous crops, including oilseed rape (Brassica napus), {{is one of}} the most devastating fungal diseases and imposes huge yield loss each year worldwide. Currently, breeding for Sclerotinia resistance in B. napus, as in other crops, can only rely on germplasms with quantitative resistance genes. Thus, the identification of quantitative trait locus (QTL) for S. sclerotiorum resistance/tolerance in this crop holds immediate promise for the genetic improvement of the disease resistance. In this study, ten QTLs for stem resistance (SR) at the mature plant stage and three QTLs for leaf resistance (LR) at the seedling stage in multiple environments were mapped on nine linkage groups (LGs) of a whole genome map for B. napus constructed with SSR markers. Two major QTLs, LRA 9 on LG A 9 and SRC 6 on LG C 6, were repeatedly detected across all environments and explained 8. 54 – 15. 86 % and 29. 01 %– 32. 61 % of the phenotypic variations, respectively. Genotypes containing resistant SRC 6 or LRA 9 allele showed a significant reduction in disease lesion after pathogen infection. Comparative mapping with Arabidopsis and data mining from previous gene profiling experiments identified that the Arabidopsis homologous gene of IGMT 5 (At 1 g 76790) was related to the SRC 6 locus. Four copies of the IGMT 5 gene in B. napus were isolated through <b>homologous</b> <b>cloning,</b> among which, only BnaC.

40|$|RNA {{processing}} and degradation are essential {{processes in the}} cell. The exosome of S. solfatarticus is able to degrade and polyadenylate RNA and is localized at {{the periphery of the}} cell. The in vitro reconstituted S. solfolobus exosome is built of a hexameric ring, containing Rrp 41 (the catalytically active subunit) and Rrp 42 to which a trimeric cap of RNA binding proteins Rrp 4 or Csl 4 is bound. Rrp 4 confers poly (A) specificity to the exosome. The archaeal DnaG protein which is homologues to the bacterial primase, and an Archaea specific exosomal subunit, directly binds to Csl 4 protein in the exosome. The majority of Rrp 41 and DnaG is detectable in the insoluble fraction and is localized at the cell periphery. In this study, {{it was found that the}} soluble and insoluble exosomes have different compositions. The soluble exosome contains less DnaG and less Csl 4 than the insoluble exosome which co-sediments with ribosomal subunits in sucrose density gradients. However, after the RNase treatment the rRNA was completely degraded but the exosome sedimentation pattern was not changed. Furthermore potential interaction partners such as EF 1 &# 945; and Nop 5 were found in the soluble exosome. The soluble and the insoluble exosomes were both active. However, different compositions of the exosome in the cell and thereby the localization could apparently be a common system in prokaryotes to separate biochemical processes in cells without compartmentalization. In this work Csl 4 was co-immunoprecipitated with the exosome using anti-Rrp 4 antibodies and vice versa. This finding clearly says that heteromeric RNA-binding caps are present in vivo. The presence of the heteromeric RNA binding cap probably ensures its interaction with different transcripts and probably different interaction partners. To understand the mechanism for poly (A) specificity of Rrp 4, an exosome with an RNA-binding cap composed of truncated Rrp 4 lacking the KH domain was reconstituted and analyzed. The deletion of the KH domain decreased the degradation activity, but the poly (A) specificity was retained. This finding says that the KH domain of the RNA binding Rrp 4 protein is not responsible for the poly (A) specificity. It was further found that the proportion of soluble exosome increases in the stationary phase. Moreover the exosome amount increases under the cold stress conditions. The amount of exosome in pH high, pH low and heat stress was constant. These results strongly suggest that archeal exosome plays an important role under cold stress and in the stationary phase for the survival of the cells. <b>Homologous</b> <b>cloning</b> system was used to express recombinant His-tagged exosomal proteins in S. solfataricus. It was possible to clone the genes rrp 4, csl 4 and dnaG, as well as the dnaG parts encoding the N terminal and the C terminal portions of the protein, in to the pMJ 0503 vector. However it was possible to transform and express only the full length DnaG-His 6 in S. solfataricus M 16. Overexpression was achieved in the stationary phase and the exosome containing DnaG-His 6 and the native DnaG was isolated by Ni-NTA chromatography. For the first time, the native DnaG which was directly isolated from S. solfataricus was observed as a dimer with 2 lobes and a central pore using SPEM.

By means of transposon Tn 5 mutagenesis, we have isolated a class of mutants that have an afluidal colony morphology but retain the ability to cause severe wilting and death of tobacco plants. One such mutant, KD 700, was studied in detail. By marker exchange mutagenesis, the altered colony morphology was shown to be the result of a single Tn 5 insertion in a 14. 3 -kilobase EcoRI fragment. This defect could be corrected by introducing a <b>homologous</b> <b>clone</b> from a cosmid library of the wild-type, parental strain K 60. The Tn 5 -containing fragment was introduced into other P. solanacearum wild-type strains by marker exchange, and these altered strains had the same afluidal phenotype as KD 700. N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNac), the major constituent of EPS of all wild-type strains of P. solanacearum, was not detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of vascular fluids from wilting plants infected by KD 700. In contrast, GalNac was readily detected in similar fluids of plants infected by K 60. Polysaccharides extracted from culture filtrates of KD 700 contained approximately one-fifth of the GalNac present in polysaccharides from K 60. No differences in growth rates in culture or in planta between the mutant and the parental strains were observed.

Interestingly, the increased Nf 314 transcript levels were present in cells fed on mouse brain, liver, or NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts but not in cells fed on bacteria or in axenic culture. Thus, the inducer of the increased gene expression correlates with use of mammalian cells as a food source without regard to level of virulence.

The rationale is that the inserted gusA sequence is only expected to be activated when integrated downstream of a native gene promoter, creating a functional gene fusion. Five transgenic Arabidopsis lines that were previously demonstrated to exhibit GUS fusion activity in vascular tissues were selected for this study. The number of T-DNA inserts in these lines was determined, {{and three of the}} five lines were found to contain single T-DNA copies. One line containing a single T-DNA insert, designated AtVS- 1, was selected for further study.;Promoterless gusA expression in AtVS- 1 was analysed throughout development, and a temporal and spatial regulation of gusA gene expression was observed. A putative aberrant roof phenotype was also revealed. An inverse PCR strategy was used to amplify genomic sequences flanking the T-DNA left border in AtVS- 1, to yield an IPCR product of 1. 45 kb. The IPCR product was used as a molecular probe to identify <b>homologous</b> <b>clones</b> in wild-type genomic and cDNA libraries, which have been partially sequenced and show no similarity with other known genes. AtVS- 1 was also used as a marker line to analyse cellular organization in two embryonic morphogenesis mutants. These results demonstrate the potential of promoter trapping as a means of creating functional tags to analyse genomic sequences direction transgene expression in the vascular tissues, and to facilitate the isolation of those sequences...|$|R
40|$|Cloned Giardia {{isolates}} {{obtained from}} a sheep, a calf, and a human possessed a major membrane protein that showed marked intraspecific variations in size as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following surface biotinylation and radioiodination. Metabolic labeling with [35 S] cysteine and electrophoretic analysis also revealed for each cloned isolate a predominant protein that corresponded in size to the major surface protein demonstrated by surface labeling techniques. Immunoprecipitation studies with a polyclonal antiserum specifically directed against the 90 -kDa major cysteine-rich protein purified from a subclone of the sheep isolate (O 2 - 4 A 1) showed that the cysteine-rich protein and the major surface protein are identical. The surface location of the antigen was further corroborated by the reaction of fluorescence-labeled antibodies raised against the 90 -kDa O 2 - 4 A 1 cysteine-rich protein with the entire surface of live trophozoites of the <b>homologous</b> <b>clone.</b> The ability of the cloned Giardia isolates to undergo variations of their cysteine-rich surface protein (CRISP) was demonstrated by the spontaneous appearance of new CRISPs in clonally derived populations during prolonged in vitro culturing and in cultures of the O 2 - 4 A 1 clone that had survived treatment with the cytotoxic anti- 90 -kDa CRISP antiserum specific for the surface antigen of this clone. The surviving progeny were devoid of the original CRISP, as judged by resistance to the immune serum. Subsequent cysteine metabolic labeling of the recloned surviving trophozoites demonstrated {{a large number of}} new variants, each expressing a single CRISP that varied significantly in molecular weight from those in the different cloned lines. These studies suggest that the presence of CRISPs and their variations are not restricted to Giardia isolates obtained from humans but are universal phenomena among the Giardia duodenalis types of organisms...|$|R
40|$|Senescence was induced in {{leaves of}} Arabidopsis thal-iana by {{transferring}} rosettes from a nutrient-sufficient medium to water. A visible gradient of yellowing along the shoot axis became apparent within 5 d. Leaves were grouped into four age-classes, representing fully green (nodes 17 - 20) through about one-third (nodes 13 - 16) and one-half (9 - 12) {{to more than}} 80 % yellow (5 - 8). The decrease in chlorophyll and carotenoid con-tent with increasing tissue senescence was accom-panied by a loss of total protein and of specific polypeptides identified by electrophoresis and Western blotting. Heterogeneity in the rates at which photosynthetic proteins decreased during senescence {{could be related to}} differences in susceptibility to proteolysis conferred by location (soluble proteins are more labile than membrane components) and associ-ation with stabilizing components such as pigments. The abundance of senescence-related mRNAs was determined by Northern analysis using heterologous DNA probes and also cDNAs isolated from Arabidopsis by differential library screening. Expression of the plastid gene psbA increased until the most extreme stage of senescence, in contrast to the pattern of the protein it encodes, D 1, which was almost undetectable in all but mature green tissue. Transcripts correspond-ing to two senescence-enhanced cDNAs from Brassica napus, LSC 54 and LSC 94, were strongly up-regulated in senescing Arabidopsis leaves. Two Arabidopsis cDNAs, LdeVA 8 and LdeVA 32, detected mRNAs of increasing abundance up to mid-senescence and decreasing thereafter. Another <b>homologous</b> <b>clone,</b> LdeVA 43, hybridized with a transcript showing some enhancement in early senescence. Partial base sequences of LdeVA 8 and LdeVA 32 revealed homolog-ies with genes encoding a metallothionein-like protein and catalase, respectively. LSC 54 also encodes a putative metallothionein. The possible significance of the patterns of gene expression in senescing rosette leaves of A. thaliana is discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody (MAb 24 B 10), derived from mice immunized with Drosophila retina, exclusively stains photoreceptor {{cells in the}} retina and their axonal projections to the optic ganglia. The antigen (Ag 24 B 10) is a 160 -kDa glycoprotein comprising about 0. 8 % of the retina protein. By microsequencing, 19 of the first 21 amino acids at the NH 2 -terminal end of the protein have been determined. Using synthetic oligonucleotide probes corresponding to a portion of this amino acid sequence, we isolated a <b>homologous</b> genomic <b>clone.</b> A partial DNA sequence of this clone, along with blot experiments on genomic DNA and RNA, indicate that this clone {{is part of the}} structural gene for Ag 24 B 10. By in situ hybridization, the gene was localized to the tip of chromosome 3 R...|$|R
40|$|A {{new source}} of cytoplasmic male {{sterility}} (cms) in pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) derived from a half-sib progeny of the Early Gene Pool (EGP 261) and used in a male-sterile line, ICMA 90111, was compared with other known cms sources for RFLP of mitochondrial (mt) DNA. Southern blot hybridization of mtDNA from ICMA 90111 digested with several restriction enzymes and probed with <b>homologous</b> mtDNA <b>clones</b> from pearl millet and heterologous gene clones from maize and wheat revealed the RFLP patterns of ICMA 90111 distinct from others studied so far. The dendrogram of male-sterile lines constructed from the Southern blot hybridization patterns indicated that ICMA 90111 represents a separate group. Our results suggest that this source of cms is unique in several respects. Key words: Pennisetum glaucum, cytoplasmic male sterility, mitochondrial DNA, RFLP...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEarlier we {{reported}} the primary structure of serum calcium-decreasing factor (caldecrin) from rat pancreas, a protein {{which is considered}} to be a member of the elastase family. In this report, we describe the isolation of the two <b>homologous</b> cDNA <b>clones</b> encoding caldecrin from human pancreas, the structures of which are identical except for one base and the corresponding amino acid residue. These human caldecrin isoforms are composed of a signal peptide of 16 amino acids, a propeptide of 13 amino acids, and a mature form of 239 amino acids. Both recombinant caldecrins showed the same chymotrypsin-type protease activity and hypocalcemic activity. The hypocalcemic activity of both remained intact even after treatment with PMSF to abolish their protease activity. These results suggest that human caldecrin possesses hypocalcemic activity that has no connection with its protease activity...|$|R

This transcript contains a novel joining region and similar transcripts appear to be relatively abundant in several T-cell lines...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the chromosomal localization of murine lambda light (L) chain structural genes, DNA from {{a panel of}} 11 mouse x hamster somatic cell hybrids was scored {{for the presence of}} sequences <b>homologous</b> to <b>cloned</b> lambda DNA probe molecules. Six of the hybrids had detectable lambda I and lambda II gene sequences. In all six, the full complement of murine sequences was present, and in its germline configuration. The remaining hybrids lacked any detectable murine lambda L chain gene sequences. The only mouse chromosome present in all of the positive hybrids and absent from the negative ones was number 16, allowing the assignment of lambda L chain structural genes to this chromosome. Together with the previous assignments of the kappa L chain genes to chromosome 6 and heavy chain genes to chromosome 12, this finding completes the mapping of Ig structural genes in the mouse at the chromosomal level...|$|R
