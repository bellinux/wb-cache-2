We propose algorithms for handling <b>homogeneous</b> <b>services,</b> i. e., services with equal resource requirements, and for heterogeneous services, i. e., services with diverse resource requirements. We have investigated the effect of load balancing in a simulated peer-to-peer system with a skip-list overlay network. Our simulation results indicate that in case that the churn (nodes joining or leaving) is negligible, a system that hosts services with small resource requirements can maintain equal performance for all nodes with a small variance. In case that churn is high, a system that hosts <b>homogeneous</b> <b>services</b> with large resource requirements can maintain equal node performance within a reasonable variance requiring only few service migrations...|$|R

As a result, the offered transmission rate is the same, while the time used to transmit frames depends on the propagation conditions for each destination terminal. Notice that if the frame scheduler implements other policy like sharing the same amount of transmission time among terminals, it will penalize the terminals under the worst propagation conditions, so we would have a similar situation to what happen within DVB-S.|$|E

We seek for and compare the socially optimal and the incumbent’s profit maximizing access price in two scenarios: (i) service-based firms and incumbent supply <b>homogeneous</b> <b>services</b> (partial differentiation), and (ii) all services are horizontally differentiated (uniform differentiation). We show that {{in both cases the}} incumbent never forecloses service-based firms if infrastructure-based competition is present or if services are somewhat differentiated. Under uniform differentiation the welfare optimizing access price is below marginal cost, hence the incumbent subsidizes the production of service-based firms and makes zero profit. In the case of partial differentiation, the same result obtains when both markets are concentrated. However, if markets are not concentrated, the socially optimal access fee exceeds the marginal cost. ...|$|R

The aim with {{this paper is to}} research the impact the corporate brand image has on customer satisfaction and customer loyalty within the travel industry to further the understanding of how branding activities influence customer preferences. By using a survey with an experimental design, where corporate brand image is manipulated through a PR-article, the results indicate that a company can influence the loyalty a customer feels toward their brand by trying to influence the corporate brand image. The results also support the idea that corporate brand image does have its own effect on customer loyalty and is not merely indirectly influencing it through customer satisfaction. Furthermore, these results are of interest to the travel industry since it indicates that PR campaigns can aid the travel agency in differentiating itself from its competitors.

The ICIC approach tries to improve the cell-edge performance by accepting some level of interference and thus provides more <b>homogeneous</b> <b>service</b> to users located at different regions of the network. Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) is an asserted idea in this context that divides available frequency bands into different groups, where each band is designed to be dedicated to certificated users with different reuse factors which correspond to their channel conditions [4]. Consequently, quality of communication of users who suffer more from interference can be improved by less reuse of their allocated subchannels.|$|E

These services are however developed by various vendors without following appropriate standards. However, the need for interoperability and reusability prompts the need for service integration.

The current methods of integrating heterogeneous services are manual integration methods. Therefore, the challenge with the current methods is time consumption, lack of flexibility, cost (TCO and TCD), total time to development, because the process is manual. In this paper, we explore the challenges regarding dynamic integration of heterogeneous services and identify key issues that need to be addressed, in order to develop a successful mechanism that will enable dynamic integration of heterogeneous services...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe cloud {{model is}} rapidly evolving, with {{maturing}} intercloud architectures and progressive integration of sparse, geodistributed resources into large datacenters. The single-provider administrative barrier is also increasingly crossed by applications, allowing new verticals {{to benefit from}} the multicloud model. For instance, in home healthcare systems, transparent usage of resources from multiple providers enables "follow-me" scenarios, where healthcare services are accessible anywhere, anytime, with quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. However, transparency might be at odds with security and jurisdictions, imposing restrictions on where data and applications might be stored and run. Existing intercloud approaches either disrupt application deployment mechanisms or compromise infrastructure homogeneity, making enforcing a uniform QoS level more complex, notably for protection. This article introduces Orchestration for beyond Intercloud Security (Orbits), an infrastructure-as-a-service-level architecture that enables flexible and legacy intercloud application deployment for mobile remote healing, while providing a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>service</b> abstraction across multiple clouds.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} a model addressing the heterogeneity problem of Pervasive Computing systems from a resource, service and context management view-point. The presented system architecture, called UBIDEV {{is a collection}} of abstraction services for semantic-driven management of the physical environment that provide a design methodology that allow a description of the behavior of the whole system in terms of coordinated <b>homogeneous</b> <b>services.</b> Most of the existing approaches try to hide heterogeneity using a single uniform abstraction layer like the Java VM; these models do not fit the requirements of pervasive computing systems where the dy-namism and the heterogeneity if the environment need {{to be taken into account}} even at the design level. The presented model faces heterogeneity of pervasive comput-ing systems allowing applications to be described in terms of services provided rather than their low level instantiation details. The main contribution of UBIDEV is in the holistic approach in the management of the environment from the resources, services and context viewpoint. The resulting coordination model allows applications to be described in terms of their functionality while maintaining the degree of dependence they have with the physical environment. At the application level, the provided ab-stractions allow to build applications that were previously seen as difficult to build: context-awareness that scale along several dimensions, resource and service manage-ment that copes with heterogeneity using an agreed semantic, holistic coordination of resources in a service-oriented abstraction model. An example application scenario is then described to underline the approach and the added value of such architecture in terms of system design and resource and service management. ...|$|R

In this global era, {{we live in a world}} of rising knowledge economies, digital technologies, and awareness of environmental issues. The so-called "modern infrastructural ideal" of spatially and socially ubiquitous centrally-governed infrastructures providing exclusive, <b>homogeneous</b> <b>services</b> over extensive areas, has been the standard of reference for the provision of basic essential services, such as water and energy supply. This book argues that, after decades of undisputed domination, this ideal is being increasingly questioned and that the network ideology that supports it may be waning. In order to begin exploring the highly diverse, fluid and unstable landscapes emerging beyond the networked city, this book identifies dynamics through which a ‘break’ with previous configurations has been operated, and new brittle zones of socio-technical controversy through which urban infrastructure (and its wider meaning) are being negotiated and fought over. It uncovers, across a diverse set of urban contexts, new ways in which processes of urbanization and infrastructure production are being combined with crucial sociopolitical implications: through shifting political economies of infrastructure which rework resource distribution and value creation; through new infrastructural spaces and territorialities which rebundle socio-technical systems for particular interests and claims; and through changing offsets between individual and collective appropriation, experience and mobilization of infrastructure. With contributions from leading authorities in the field and drawing on theoretical advances and original empirical material, this book is a major contribution to an ongoing infrastructural turn in urban studies, and will be of interest to all those concerned by the diverse forms and contested outcomes of contemporary urban change across North and South...|$|R

The <b>homogeneous</b> <b>service</b> community contains two types of discovery: the search of similar operations and that of composible operations. Second, we describe a similarity measurement model for Web services by leveraging the metadata from WSDL, and design a graph-based algorithm to support both of the two discovery types.

40|$|We {{consider}} a discrete population of users with <b>homogeneous</b> <b>service</b> demand {{who need to}} decide when to arrive to {{a system in which}} the service rate deteriorates linearly with the number of users in the system. The users have heterogeneous desired departure times from the system, and their goal is to minimize a weighted sum of the travel time and square deviation from the desired departure times. Users join the system sequentially, according to the order of their desired departure times. We model this scenario as a non-cooperative game in which each user selects his actual arrival time. We present explicit equilibria solutions for a two-user example, namely the subgame perfect and Nash equilibria and show that multiple equilibria may exist. We further explain why a general solution for any number of users is computationally challenging. The difficulty {{lies in the fact that}} the objective functions are piecewise convex, i. e., non-smooth and non-convex. As a result, the minimization of the costs relies on checking all arrival and departure order permutations, which is exponentially large with respect to the population size. Instead we propose an iterated best-response algorithm which can be efficiently studied numerically. Finally, we compare the equilibrium arrival profiles to a socially optimal solution and discuss the implications...|$|E
40|$|Our paper {{presents}} {{solutions that}} can significantly improve the delay performance of putting and retrieving data {{in and out}} of cloud storage. We first focus on measuring the delay performance of a very popular cloud storage service Amazon S 3. We establish that there is significant randomness in service times for reading and writing small and medium size objects when assigned distinct keys. We further demonstrate that using erasure coding, parallel connections to storage cloud and limited chunking (i. e., dividing the object into a few smaller objects) together pushes the envelope on service time distributions significantly (e. g., 76 %, 80 %, and 85 % reductions in mean, 90 th, and 99 th percentiles for 2 Mbyte files) at the expense of additional storage (e. g., 1. 75 x). However, chunking and erasure coding increase the load and hence the queuing delays while reducing the supportable rate region in number of requests per second per node. Thus, {{in the second part of}} our paper we focus on analyzing the delay performance when chunking, FEC, and parallel connections are used together. Based on this analysis, we develop load adaptive algorithms that can pick the best code rate on a per request basis by using off-line computed queue backlog thresholds. The solutions work with <b>homogeneous</b> <b>services</b> with fixed object sizes, chunk sizes, operation type (e. g., read or write) as well as heterogeneous services with mixture of object sizes, chunk sizes, and operation types. We also present a simple greedy solution that opportunistically uses idle connections and picks the erasure coding rate accordingly on the fly. Both backlog and greedy solutions support the full rate region and provide best mean delay performance when compared to the best fixed coding rate policy. Our evaluations show that backlog based solutions achieve better delay performance at higher percentile values than the greedy solution...|$|R

A number of assumptions are made in the literature relating to accountability; these concern the necessity of multiple strategies of accountability, information symmetries, sanctions, trust, <b>homogeneous</b> <b>service</b> users, community-level answerability, incentives, self-regarding behaviour, and for users’ voice to be heard in service delivery. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to reconsider these theoretical propositions for the functioning of accountability in light of practical experience from UK, South Africa, Bangladesh and South Korea. Each of these case studies was selected to illustrate a different form of accountability. The forms of accountability investigated in this research are professional, political, user and managerial accountabilities. An assessment is made of whether accountability is demonstrated in these case studies in the way predicted by the literature. The empirical data demonstrates that factors like multiple strategies and information/resource symmetries are critical to accountability but that there is only partial evidence to support the need for sanctions, trust, incentives, self-interest, and user voice for effective service delivery. The research indicates the need for greater emphasis on the operation and maintenance of urban services and direct accountability to service users. However the assumption that service users are homogenous is disputed. This article concludes with a review of the practical implications of strengthening accountability as a means to improve the performance of urban services...|$|E
30|$|It {{is also a}} time {{competition}} model, where {{customers are}} sensitive to waiting time, and hence endogenous externalities among customers are also present. Loch (1994 a) affirms that time competition models represent a class of firm differentiation models, {{as an alternative to}} location models, where customer externalities are exogenous, i.e., constant and given, and therefore the firm differentiation is exogenous. Differences between this model and those studied in the literature on time competition arise mainly from the control variables, the type of market and the market mechanism. The monopoly market is considered by So and Song (1997) and Parra-Frutos and Aranda (1999 b). The latter considers the possibility of reducing money price when experiencing long waiting times. Duopoly markets are investigated in Kalai et al. (1992), Li and Lee (1994), and Loch (1994 a, b). The first studies a queuing system with two servers and only one queue when money price and demand level are given. Li and Lee develop a particular queuing system with two servers and two queues with jockeying. Loch (1994 a) uses an M/G/ 1 queue to describe firms, the consumers are <b>homogeneous,</b> <b>service</b> capacity is given and does not consider costs, and thus, expected incomes are maximized. Loch (1994 b) extends the previous model to several customer groups with different levels of impatience, but models firms through an M/M/ 1 queue. Loch’s models consider delivery times endogenous, but they focus on price competition and quantity competition. Oligopolistic markets are examined by Davidson (1982, 1988) and Daniel (1995). Davidson focuses on price advertisement to consider complete and incomplete price information markets. He uses an M/M/ 1 /B queuing model with truncated arrival rate. Demand and service capacity are given. Daniel does not consider firms costs, and the expected service rate is not a control variable for the firms, which are described using an M/M/ 1 queue where service capacities are identical and given. Perfect competition is considered in Lederer and Li (1997). This model describes firms as an M/G/ 1 queue which can choose scheduling policies to specify how incoming jobs are sequenced. Firms do not offer homogeneous goods and services and customers are not homogeneous. The model does not consider budget restrictions and fixed costs.|$|E
