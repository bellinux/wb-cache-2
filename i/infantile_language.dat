Vast parts of his material are deeply rooted in German language and do not translate well into other languages.|$|E

While in the Internet, in a general manner, there is a handful of different phenomenon in which users communicate with abbreviations to simplify writing, miguxês carries with it an affective intention, that is, to express an <b>infantile</b> <b>language</b> in a conversation between friends, or even satirize this style of communication. In certain subcultures in Brazil, {{especially in the case of}} what is called 'emo' there, miguxês is an item of group identification. So it would not be unusual for someone which opposes such subcultures to also develop a distaste for miguxês. Brazilian 'anti-emo' groups usually satirize 'emo' teenagers with use of miguxês.|$|E
40|$|Thc paper {{gives an}} {{analysis}} of t he phonemic substitutions occurring in the spccch of an aphasic patient. The confusions arc compared with those listed in published material rcfcrring {{to the development of}} speech in children. It has been held by various writers on the subject of aphasia that changes in the speech of an adult aphasic bear some relation to the developments in thc speech OE a child when he is learning to talk. This is said to be particulatly the case at the phonetic and phonemic level of speech: the sounds which the child acquires last {{will be the first to}} be affected in aphasic disturbances and, further, will be the last to re-appear in cases where the aphasic patient recovers his speech. Thus Alajouaninc (1956) says: “It is our impression that there are strong analogies between the pathological phonetic alterations (in aphasia) and the first manifestations of <b>infantile</b> <b>language</b> [...] Numerous changes which can be observed during different stages of recovery in our patients are also found in the normal phonetic progress of a child, i. c. dissimilation, assimilation, metathesis, elision, etc., to use the terminology of phonetics ”...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: {{to assess}} the lexical {{proficiency}} and the incidence of phonologic disorders {{in the language of}} children infected with HIV. METHOD: the study population consisted of 31 children between three and seven year-old. For evaluation purposes the Test of <b>Infantile</b> <b>Language</b> - ABFW was applied in the areas of phonology and vocabulary. RESULTS: the results obtained were analyzed according to the clinical criteria for the classification of the disease proposed by the CDC and regarding the immunological profile and the viral burden using the Mann-Whitney test for statistical analysis. In the vocabulary evaluation, 100 % of the children presented an inappropriate response for their age in at least two distinct conceptual fields. In the phonologic evaluation, 67. 7 % of the assessed children were considered to be affected by some phonologic disorder. When we compared adequate and inadequate results of phonologic evaluation to the clinical and immunological parameters of AIDS such as clinical classification (p= 0, 16), CD 4 count (p= 0, 37) and viral burden (p= 0, 82), we did not detect a statistically significant relation between language alterations and disease severity. CONCLUSION: this research has shown that the studied group presents a high risk for language disorders and that constant phonoaudiological follow-up is essential to identify the alterations in early stage...|$|E
40|$|SummaryPhonological Disorder is a {{disturbance}} of primary manifestation of undefined causes that makes speech become unintelligible. The analysis of vocal parameters becomes {{important in the}} process of diagnosis of this disorder, since voice disorders could interfere in the production of speech sounds. Aim: The objective {{of this study was to}} verify vocal characteristics related to the intensity and fundamental frequency -F 0 - and their disturbance indexes - jitter and shimmer - in children with phonological disorders. Study design: clinical prospective with transversal cohort. Material and Method: There were 40 children, 20 of them with phonological disorders and 20 with no speech and language disturbances. Phonological exams with the ABFW <b>infantile</b> <b>language</b> test and spontaneous speech were applied. The Computer Speech Lab was used to record and perform acoustic analyses of the vowels /a/, /e/, /i/, through the vocal parameters: fundamental frequency, intensity, jitter and shimmer. Results: F 0 - vowel /e/ was smaller, on average, in the Phonological Disorder Group and it was 126 Hz in the Control Group. To shimmer and jitter there was no evidence that the means of the Phonological Disorder Group were different from the ones of the Control Group (p= 0. 191, p= 0. 865, respectively). As for intensity, there was evidence that the average did not differ in the Phonological Disorder Group and the Control Group (p= 0. 002). Conclusion: The frequency of the vowel /e/ was smaller in the Phonological Disorder Group. There was difference between the two groups regarding the means of intensity of vowels /a/, /e/ and /i/, smaller in the Phonological Disorder Group. No differences between the groups were found regarding the averages of jitter and shimmer...|$|E

A análise de parâmetros vocais torna-se importante no processo do diagnóstico deste transtorno, pois distúrbios de voz poderiam interferir na produção dos sons da fala. OBJETIVO: O objetivo deste estudo foi verificar as características vocais relacionadas à intensidade e freqüência {{fundamental}} - F 0 - e seus índices de perturbação - jitter e shimmer - em crianças com transtorno fonológico. FORMA DE ESTUDO: clínico prospectivo com coorte transversal. MATERIAL E MÉTODO: Foram sujeitos 40 crianças distribuídas em dois grupos: 20 com transtorno fonológico e 20 sem alteração de fala e linguagem. Foram aplicadas provas de fonologia do Teste de Linguagem Infantil ABFW e de fala espontânea. Utilizou-se o Computer Speech Lab, para gravação e análise acústica das vogais /a/, /e/, /i/, por meio dos parâmetros vocais: freqüência fundamental, intensidade, jitter e shimmer. RESULTADOS: F 0 - vogal /e/ é menor, em média, para o Grupo com Transtorno Fonológico (126 Hz) e 237 Hz no Grupo Controle. Para o shimmer e jitter não há evidência de que as médias do Grupo com Transtorno Fonológico sejam diferentes das do Grupo Controle (p= 0, 191, p= 0, 865 respectivamente). Quanto à intensidade, há evidência de que a média diferencia os dois grupos (p= 0, 002). CONCLUSÃO: A freqüência da vogal /e/ é menor no Grupo com Transtorno Fonológico. Existe diferença entre grupos para as médias da intensidade das vogais /a/, /e/ e /i/, sendo estas menores no Grupo com Transtorno Fonológico. Não foram encontradas diferenças entre grupos para as médias do jitter e do shimmer.
