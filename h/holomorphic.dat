5|$|An {{analytic}} function is uniquely extended to a <b>holomorphic</b> function {{on an open}} disk in the complex plane. This makes the machinery of complex analysis available.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Ramanujan {{discovered}} mock theta functions. For many years these functions were a mystery, but they are now known to be the <b>holomorphic</b> parts of harmonic weak Maass forms.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{generalization of}} the derivative concerns complex functions of complex variables, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers C to C. The {{notion of the}} derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If C is identified with R2 by writing a complex number z as , then a differentiable function from C to C is certainly differentiable as a function from R2 to R2 (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is complex linear and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the Cauchy–Riemann equations – see <b>holomorphic</b> functions.|$|E
25|$|Because complex {{differentiation}} is linear and obeys the product, quotient, {{and chain}} rules; the sums, products and compositions of <b>holomorphic</b> functions are <b>holomorphic,</b> and the quotient of two <b>holomorphic</b> functions is <b>holomorphic</b> wherever the denominator is not zero.|$|E
25|$|If f {{is complex}} {{differentiable}} at every point z0 {{in an open}} set U, we say that f is <b>holomorphic</b> on U. We say that f is <b>holomorphic</b> at the point z0 if it is <b>holomorphic</b> on some neighborhood of z0. We say that f is <b>holomorphic</b> on some non-open set A if it is <b>holomorphic</b> in an open set containing A.|$|E
25|$|As {{with any}} map between complex manifolds, a {{function}} f: M → N between two Riemann surfaces M and N is called <b>holomorphic</b> if for every chart g in the atlas of M and every chart h in the atlas of N, the map h o f o g−1 is <b>holomorphic</b> (as a function from C to C) {{wherever it is}} defined. The composition of two <b>holomorphic</b> maps is <b>holomorphic.</b> The two Riemann surfaces M and N are called biholomorphic (or conformally equivalent to emphasize the conformal point of view) if there exists a bijective <b>holomorphic</b> function from M to N whose inverse is also <b>holomorphic</b> (it {{turns out that the}} latter condition is automatic and can therefore be omitted). Two conformally equivalent Riemann surfaces are for all practical purposes identical.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a <b>holomorphic</b> {{function}} is a complex-valued function {{of one or}} more complex variables that is complex differentiable in a neighborhood of every point in its domain. The existence of a complex derivative in a neighborhood is a very strong condition, for it implies that any <b>holomorphic</b> {{function is}} actually infinitely differentiable and equal to its own Taylor series (analytic). <b>Holomorphic</b> functions are the central objects of study in complex analysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} a <b>holomorphic</b> {{function}} can be extended to the infinite-dimensional spaces of functional analysis. For instance, the Fréchet or Gâteaux derivative {{can be used to}} define a notion of a <b>holomorphic</b> function on a Banach space over the field of complex numbers.|$|E
25|$|A complex {{analytic}} {{space is}} a locally ringed space whose structure sheaf is a -algebra and is locally isomorphic to the vanishing locus of a finite set of <b>holomorphic</b> functions {{together with the}} restriction (to the vanishing locus) of the sheaf of <b>holomorphic</b> functions on Cn for some n.|$|E
25|$|If f is a <b>holomorphic</b> {{function}} on a connected open subset U of , then {{a branch}} of logf on U is a continuous function g on U such that e'g(z)=f(z) for all z in U. Such a function g is necessarily <b>holomorphic</b> with g′(z)=f′(z)/f(z) for all z in U.|$|E
25|$|The {{radius of}} {{convergence}} is 1/e, {{as may be}} seen by the ratio test. The function defined by this series can be extended to a <b>holomorphic</b> function defined on all complex numbers with a branch cut along the interval (−∞, −1/e]; this <b>holomorphic</b> function defines the principal branch of the Lambert W function.|$|E
25|$|K is the {{canonical}} line bundle whose sections are the <b>holomorphic</b> 2-forms.|$|E
25|$|For a {{proof of}} this theorem, see analyticity of <b>holomorphic</b> functions.|$|E
25|$|The lower {{incomplete}} gamma and {{the upper}} incomplete gamma function, as defined above for real positive s and x, can be developed into <b>holomorphic</b> functions, with respect both to x and s, defined for almost all combinations of complex x and s. Complex analysis shows how properties of the real incomplete gamma functions extend to their <b>holomorphic</b> counterparts.|$|E
25|$|With Elmer Rees, Atiyah {{studied the}} problem of the {{relation}} between topological and <b>holomorphic</b> vector bundles on projective space. They solved the simplest unknown case, by showing that all rank 2 vector bundles over projective 3-space have a <b>holomorphic</b> structure. Horrocks had previously found some non-trivial examples of such vector bundles, which were later used by Atiyah in his study of instantons on the 4-sphere.|$|E
25|$|The complex plane has the {{remarkable}} property {{that it is}} invariant under <b>holomorphic</b> changes of coordinate.|$|E
25|$|Every <b>holomorphic</b> {{function}} is analytic. That is, a <b>holomorphic</b> function f has derivatives of every order at each point a in its domain, and it coincides {{with its own}} Taylor series at a in a neighborhood of a. In fact, f coincides with its Taylor series at a in any disk centered at that point and lying within {{the domain of the}} function.|$|E
25|$|Thus a Möbius {{transformation}} {{is always a}} bijective <b>holomorphic</b> function from the Riemann sphere to the Riemann sphere.|$|E
25|$|For each g, the {{function}} m(g,z) is non-vanishing on H and therefore has two possible <b>holomorphic</b> square roots.|$|E
25|$|The {{critical}} {{strip of}} the Riemann zeta function has the remarkable property of universality. This zeta-function universality states that there exists some {{location on the}} critical strip that approximates any <b>holomorphic</b> function arbitrarily well. Since <b>holomorphic</b> functions are very general, this property is quite remarkable. The first proof of universality was provided by Sergei Mikhailovitch Voronin in 1975. More recent work has included effective versions of Voronin's theorem and extending it to Dirichlet L-functions.|$|E
25|$|If {{continuity}} is not given, {{the converse}} {{is not necessarily}} true. A simple converse is that if u and v have continuous first partial derivatives and satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations, then f is <b>holomorphic.</b> A more satisfying converse, which is much harder to prove, is the Looman–Menchoff theorem: if f is continuous, u and v have first partial derivatives (but not necessarily continuous), and they satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations, then f is <b>holomorphic.</b>|$|E
25|$|If f is <b>holomorphic</b> at {{the cusp}} (has no pole at q=0), {{it is called}} an entire modular form.|$|E
25|$|Since {{a branch}} of lognbsp&z is <b>holomorphic,</b> and since its {{derivative}} 1/z is never 0, it defines a conformal map.|$|E
25|$|Every non-compact Riemann surface admits non-constant <b>holomorphic</b> {{functions}} (with {{values in}} C). In fact, every non-compact Riemann surface is a Stein manifold.|$|E
25|$|The {{converse}} question, {{whether the}} almost complex structure implies {{the existence of}} a complex structure is much less trivial, and not true in general. On an arbitrary almost complex manifold one can always find coordinates for which the almost complex structure takes the above canonical form at any given point p. In general, however, {{it is not possible to}} find coordinates so that J takes the canonical form on an entire neighborhood of p. Such coordinates, if they exist, are called 'local <b>holomorphic</b> coordinates for J'. If M admits local <b>holomorphic</b> coordinates for J around every point then these patch together to form a <b>holomorphic</b> atlas for M giving it a complex structure, which moreover induces J. J is then said to be 'integrable'. If J is induced by a complex structure, then it is induced by a unique complex structure.|$|E
25|$|Each branch L(z) of lognbsp&z on an {{open set}} U is an inverse of a {{restriction}} of the exponential function, namely the restriction {{to the image of}} U under L. Since the exponential function is <b>holomorphic</b> (i.e., complex differentiable) with nonvanishing derivative, the complex analogue of the inverse function theorem applies. It shows that L(z) is <b>holomorphic</b> at each z in U, and L′(z) = 1/z. Another way to prove this is to check the Cauchy–Riemann equations in polar coordinates.|$|E
25|$|A complex {{manifold}} is a {{topological space}} modeled on a Euclidean space over the complex field {{and for which}} all the transition maps are <b>holomorphic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{completeness}} of the Hermite functions {{follows from}} the fact that the Bargmann transform is unitary and carries the orthonormal basis e'n(z) of <b>holomorphic</b> Fock space onto the H'n(x).|$|E
25|$|In {{regions where}} the first {{derivative}} is not zero, <b>holomorphic</b> functions are conformal {{in the sense that}} they preserve angles and the shape (but not size) of small figures.|$|E
25|$|The {{corresponding}} normalised solutions f'n of the Beltrami equations {{and their}} inverses g'n satisfy uniform Hölder estimates. They are therefore equicontinuous on any compact subset of C; {{they are even}} <b>holomorphic</b> for |z| > R. So by the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem, passing to a subsequence if necessary, it can be assumed that both f'n and g'n converge uniformly on compacta to f and g. The limits will satisfy the same Hölder estimates and be <b>holomorphic</b> for |z| > R. The relations f'n∘g'n = id = g'n∘f'n imply that in the limit f∘g = id = g∘f, so that f and g are homeomorphisms.|$|E
25|$|Isotropic {{rectangles}} play {{a fundamental}} {{role in this}} theory since they form the domains of existence for <b>holomorphic</b> functions, domains of convergence of power series, and domains of convergence of functional series.|$|E
25|$|If f is meromorphic but not <b>holomorphic</b> at the cusp, it {{is called}} a non-entire modular form. For example, the j-invariant is a non-entire modular form of weight 0, and has a simple pole ati∞.|$|E
25|$|If one {{identifies}} C with R2, {{then the}} <b>holomorphic</b> functions coincide with those functions of two real variables with continuous first derivatives which solve the Cauchy–Riemann equations, {{a set of}} two partial differential equations.|$|E
25|$|Consider the annular region A {{centered}} at the eigenvalue λ with sufficiently {{small radius}} ε {{such that the}} intersection of the open disc Bε(λ) and σ(T) is {λ}. The resolvent function R'T is <b>holomorphic</b> on A.|$|E
25|$|In {{algebraic}} geometry, this {{classification of}} (isomorphism classes of) complex line bundles {{by the first}} Chern class is a crude approximation to the classification of (isomorphism classes of) <b>holomorphic</b> line bundles by linear equivalence classes of divisors.|$|E
25|$|The {{radius of}} {{convergence}} {{of a power}} series ƒ centered on a point a {{is equal to the}} distance from a to the nearest point where ƒ cannot be defined {{in a way that makes}} it <b>holomorphic.</b>|$|E
