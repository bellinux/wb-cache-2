This paper shows that because Finnish companies tend {{to pay more}} attention to tax considerations than so-called economic reality when preparing their financial reports, this drift does not exist for reported earnings, i. e. net profit based on Finnish accounting regulations. It appears, however, that several other income levels assessed by financial statement analysis are important in this respect. The results imply that firms that make extensive adjustments for tax purposes have high unexpected returns. This is explained by the fact that those firms have enough income to extensively exploit the depreciation and other earnings management possibilities. ...|$|R

The department reported that in fiscal years 2005 and 2006, these investments cost $ 611. 8 million to develop, operate, and maintain.

In the 72 years since the UI program began, the nature of work has changed in fundamental ways. In recent decades the number of low-wage jobs, the average duration of unemployment, {{and the number of}} women in the workforce have all increased. This testimony addresses: (1) the overall trend in the usage of UI; (2) the likelihood that low-wage workers will be unemployed and receive UI benefits, especially when compared to higher-wage workers; and (3) the likelihood that part-time workers receive UI benefits. This testimony is based primarily on GAO's September 2007 report (GAO- 07 - 1147) on the same topic as well additional analyses.

We compared this file to data in the Social Security Administration's (SSA) Death Master File as a technique to identify instances of potential fraud or abuse. For Wilford Hall, we identified 41 cases in which a prescription was ordered for an individual after the date of his or her death as recorded in the SSA Death Master File. Congress requested that we determine whether individuals fraudulently obtained pharmaceuticals or other health benefits by assuming the identity of a dead person, and, if so, to identify the specific breakdowns in internal controls that allowed such fraud to occur.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Recent news articles in over 30 states and prominent mental health advocacy organizations have described the difficulty many parents have in accessing mental health services for their children. As these reports documented, some parents choose to place {{their children in the}} child welfare or juvenile justice systems in order to obtain the mental health services that their children need. Senators Susan Collins and Joseph Lieberman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs asked GAO to testify on: (1) the number and characteristics of children voluntarily placed in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems to receive mental health services, (2) the factors that influence such placements, and (3) promising state and local practices that may reduce the need for child welfare and juvenile justice placements. This testimony is based on our April 2003 report on the results of a study addressing these same objectives. <b>For</b> <b>that</b> <b>report,</b> we surveyed state child welfare directors in all states and the District of Columbia and juvenile justice officials in 33 counties in the 17 states with the largest populations of children under age 18.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Increasing retirements and declining fertility rates, among other factors, could affect the labor force growth in many developed countries. To maintain the size and productivity of the labor force, many governments and employers have introduced strategies to keep workers who face greater challenges in maintaining jobs and incomes, such as women and low-skilled workers, in the workforce. This testimony discusses our work on (1) describing the policies and practices implemented in other developed countries that may help women and low-wage/low-skilled workers enter and remain in the labor force, (2) examining {{the change in the}} targeted groups' employment following the implementation of the policies and practices, and (3) identifying the factors that affect employees' use of workplace benefits and the resulting workplace implications.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Defense (DOD) {{is in the process}} of implementing its new human capital system for managing civilian personnel [...] the National Security Personnel System (NSPS). Key components of NSPS include compensation, classification, and performance management. Implementation of NSPS could have far-reaching implications, not just for DOD, but for civil service reform across the federal government. As of February 2009, about 205, 000 civilian employees were under NSPS. Based on GAO's prior work reviewing performance management in the public sector, GAO developed an initial list of safeguards that NSPS should include to ensure it is fair, effective, and credible. In 2008, Congress directed GAO to evaluate, among other things, the extent DOD implemented accountability mechanisms, including those in 5 U. S. C. section 9902 (b) (7) and other internal safeguards in NSPS. This statement is based on GAO's September 2008 report, which determined (1) the extent to which DOD has implemented internal safeguards to ensure NSPS was fair, effective, and credible; and (2) how DOD civilians perceive NSPS and what actions DOD has taken to address these perceptions. <b>For</b> <b>that</b> <b>report,</b> GAO analyzed relevant documents and employee survey results; interviewed appropriate officials; and conducted discussion groups at 12 selected installations.
