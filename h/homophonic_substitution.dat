50|$|Francesco I Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, {{used the}} {{earliest}} known example of a <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher in 1401 for correspondence with one Simone de Crema.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{example of}} the <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher is the one used by Duke of Mantua in the early 1400s. Homophonic cipher replaces each letter with multiple symbols depending on the letter frequency. The cipher is ahead of the time because it combines monoalphabetic and polyalphabetic features.|$|E
50|$|As a nomenclator cipher, the Great Cipher {{replaced}} {{the names of}} key generals such as Auguste de Marmont, references to les ennemis, and other sensitive terms with <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitutions.</b> Code sheets included alternative digits to modify the gender or letter case, so the rules of French composition held true to encryptions as well. Since e is {{the most commonly used}} letter in French, the Cipher typically allocated the most code numbers to writing this vowel: in one nomenclature, 131 out of 711 code numbers stood for e.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel Bayesian approach for deciphering complex substitution ciphers. Our method uses a decipherment model which combines information from letter n-gram language models {{as well as}} word dictionaries. Bayesian inference is performed on our model using an efficient sampling technique. We evaluate {{the quality of the}} Bayesian decipherment output on simple and <b>homophonic</b> letter <b>substitution</b> ciphers and show that unlike a previous approach, our method consistently produces almost 100 % accurate decipherments. The new method can be applied on more complex substitution ciphers and we demonstrate its utility by cracking the famous Zodiac- 408 cipher in a fully automated fashion, which has never been done before. ...|$|R
50|$|Because both ciphers classically {{employed}} novels as part {{of their}} key material, many sources confuse the book cipher and the running key cipher. They are really only very distantly related. The running key cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution, the book cipher is a <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution.</b> Perhaps the distinction is most clearly made by the fact that a running cipher would work best of all with a book of random numbers, whereas such a book (containing no text) would be useless for a book cipher.|$|E
50|$|One variant is the nomenclator. Named {{after the}} public {{official}} who announced {{the titles of}} visiting dignitaries, this cipher combines a small codebook with large <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> tables. Originally the code was restricted to the names of important people, hence {{the name of the}} cipher; in later years it covered many common words and place names as well. The symbols for whole words (codewords in modern parlance) and letters (cipher in modern parlance) were not distinguished in the ciphertext. The Rossignols' Great Cipher used by Louis XIV of France was one.|$|E
5000|$|This {{can have}} problems; if a word {{appears in the}} {{plaintext}} {{but not in the}} book, it cannot be encoded. An alternative approach which gets around this problem is to replace individual letters rather than words. One such method, used in the second Beale cipher, substitutes the first letter of a word in the book with that word's position. In this case, the book cipher is properly a cipher [...] - [...] specifically, a <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher. However, if used often, this technique has the side effect of creating a larger ciphertext (typically 4 to 6 digits being required to encipher each letter or syllable) and increases the time and effort required to decode the message.|$|E
40|$|Substitution ciphers {{are one of}} the {{earliest}} types of ciphers. Examples of classic substitution ciphers include the well-known simple substitution and the less well-known <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution.</b> Although simple substitution ciphers are indeed simple - both in terms of their use and attacks; the <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> ciphers are far more challenging to break. Even with modern computing technology, <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> ciphers remain a significant challenge. This project focuses on designing, implementing, and testing an efficient attack on <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> ciphers. We use an iterative approach that generalizes the fastest known attack on simple substitution ciphers and also employs a heuristic search technique for improved efficiency. We test our algorithm {{on a wide variety of}} <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> ciphers. Finally, we apply our technique to the “Zodiac 340 ” cipher, which is an unsolved ciphertext created in the 1970 s by the infamous Zodiac killer...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with random restarts as a mean of breaking a <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher. Based on extensive experiments, we find that such an HMM-based attack outperforms a previously de- veloped nested hill climb approach, particularly when the ciphertext message is short. We then consider a combination cipher, consisting of a <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> and a column transposition. We develop and analyze an attack on such a cipher. This attack employs an HMM (with random restarts), together with a hill climb to recover the column permutation. We show that this attack can succeed on relatively short ci- phertext messages. Finally, we test this combined attack on the unsolved Zodiac 340 cipher...|$|E
40|$|Computers have {{advanced}} to the stage that an inexpensive personal computer can perform millions of arithmetic calculations {{in less than a}} second. However, given such powerful machines, several mysteries have still remained unsolved due to their complexity. The Zodiac 340 -letter cipher is one such mystery [1]. Zodiac, the serial killer who terrorized Northern California in the late 1960 s, sent four ciphers to local newspapers [2]. The first cipher was separated into three different parts and each part was sent to Vallejo Times-Herald, the San Francisco Chronicle, and the San Francisco Examiner. The combination of all three parts formed a 408 -letter cipher (Z 408), which was decrypted one week after it was received [1, 2]. Zodiac also sent a 340 -letter cipher (Z 340) that remains unsolved to this day. The main purpose of this project is to determine whether the method used in the Z 340 was a <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution,</b> which is an improved version of the well-known simple substitution cipher. A <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> employs a “one-to-many mapping” technique, as opposed to the one-to-one mapping of a simple substitution [3]. Due to the complexity of the <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution,</b> an exhaustive solution to the Z 340 is no...|$|E
40|$|<b>Homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> ciphers {{employ a}} one-to-many key to encrypt plaintext. This is in {{contrast}} to a simple substitution cipher where a one-to-one mapping is used. The advantage of a <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher is that it makes frequency analysis more difficult, due to a more even distribution of plaintext statistics. Classic transposition ciphers apply diffusion to the ciphertext by swapping the order of letters. Combined transposition-substitution ciphers can be more challenging to cryptanalyze than either cipher type separately. In this research, we propose a technique to break a combined simple substitution- column transposition cipher. We also consider the related problem of breaking a combination homophonic substitution-column transposition cipher. These attacks extend previous work on substitution ciphers. We thoroughly analyze our attacks and we apply the homophonic substitution-columnar transposition attack to the unsolved Zodiac- 340 cipher...|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{techniques}} of source coding (or "data compression") {{can be usefully applied}} in cryptography. Five source coding schemes (ShannonFano coding, Huffman coding, Lynch-Davisson coding, Elias-Willems coding, and Lempel-Ziv coding) are reviewed and their characteristics delineated. It is then shown how the last three of these schemes, which are of the universal source coding type, can be advantageously used to create strongly-ideal ciphers, to perform "universal" <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution,</b> to test random bit generators, and to strengthen running-key generators for stream ciphers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} utility and effect of running {{numerous}} random restarts when using EM to attack decipherment problems. We find that simple decipherment models {{are able to}} crack <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> ciphers with high accuracy if {{a large number of}} random restarts are used but almost completely fail with only a few random restarts. For particularly difficult homophonic ciphers, we find that big gains in accuracy are to be had by running upwards of 100 K random restarts, which we accomplish efficiently using a GPU-based parallel implementation. We run a series of experiments using millions of random restarts in order to investigate other empirical properties of decipherment problems, including the famously uncracked Zodiac 340. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Homophonic coding, or <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution,</b> is {{referred}} to as a technique that contributes to reliability of the secret-key cipher systems. Its main goal is to convert the plaintext into a sequence of completely random (equiprobable and independent) code letters. In solving this problem three characteristics are to be considered: i) redundancy, defined as the difference between the mean codeword length and the source entropy, ii) an average number of random bits used in encoding, and iii) complexity of the encoder and decoder, measured by memory size (in bits) and computation time (in bit operations). A class of homophonic codes is suggested for which both the redundancy and the average number of random bits can be made as small as required with nonexponential growth of memory size and roughly logarithmic growth of computation time.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} two improve-ments to the beam search {{approach}} for solving <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> ciphers presented in Nuhn et al. (2013) : An im-proved rest cost estimation {{together with an}} optimized strategy for obtaining the or-der in which the symbols of the cipher are deciphered reduces the beam size needed to successfully decipher the Zodiac- 408 cipher from several million down to less than one hundred: The search effort is re-duced from several hours of computation time {{to just a few}} seconds on a single CPU. These improvements allow us to success-fully decipher {{the second part of the}} fa-mous Beale cipher (see (Ward et al., 1885) and e. g. (King, 1993)) : Having 182 differ-ent cipher symbols while having a length of just 762 symbols, the decipherment is way more challenging than the decipher-ment of the previously deciphered Zodiac- 408 cipher (length 408, 54 different sym-bols). To the best of our knowledge, this cipher has not been deciphered automati-cally before. ...|$|E

40|$|According to {{historical}} reports, many telegrams that {{date from the}} Spanish Civil War (1936 - 1939) still remain undisclosed. It is believed that these telegrams were encrypted with a cryptosystem called the "Spanish Strip Cipher" (SSC). During this civil war, SSC was the most used cryptographic algorithm. This method corresponds to a <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher in which a plaintext letter can map to between three and five ciphertext symbols. By means of cryptanalysis, the authors detect a weakness in the encryption process of the SSC. In this article, they describe how this vulnerability is exploited to efficiently reconstruct a plaintext from a relatively short ciphertext. The attack is based on combinatorial and statistical methods, and it {{is divided into three}} phases: homophones-table analysis, letter-frequency analysis, and dictionary search. The attack was implemented in Java and tested on a laptop with an i 7 processor and 4 GB of RAM. The tests were carried out with several real telegrams from the Spanish Civil War. In this article, the authors provide the results of one test that was successfully performed only using the first 201 ciphertext symbols of a Spanish telegram...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers a}} method to convert an ordinary cipher system, as used to secure e-commerce transactions, into an unconditionally secure cipher system, i. e. one that generates ciphertext that does not contain enough statistical information to break the cipher, irrespective of how much ciphertext is available. Shannon showed {{that this can be}} achieved by maximizing the entropy of the message sequence to be encrypted. This, in turn, achieved by means of homophonic coding. Homophonic coding substitutes characters in the message source with randomly chosen codewords. It offers the advantage that it enables protection against known- and chosen plaintext attacks on cipher algorithms since source statistics are randomly changed before encryption. The disadvantage of <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> is that it will in general increase the length of the message sequence. To compensate for this, homophonic coding is combined with the data compression algorithm known as arithmetic coding. It is shown that the arithmetic coding algorithm can be adapted to perform homophonic coding by dyadically decomposing the character probabilities in its probability estimation phase. By doing this, a faster version of arithmetic coding, known as shift-and-add arithmetic coding can be implemented. A new method of statistical modelling, based on an Infinite Impulse Response filtering method is presented. A method to adapt the well-known Lempel-Ziv- Welch compression algorithm to perform homophonic coding is also presented. The procedure involves a bit-wise exclusive-or randomization operation during encoding. The results show that the adapted algorithms do indeed increase the entropy of the source sequences by no more than 2 bits/symbol, and even offers compression in some cases.
