50|$|In 1914 Brown {{suggested}} that the distinctive frill and horn form of Anchiceratops were caused by sexual selection and intra-species recognition, as he could not explain {{the differences between the}} taxa by a difference in <b>defence</b> <b>function.</b> In 1959, Wann Langston Jr. {{suggested that}} Anchiceratops engaged in a semi-aquatic lifestyle. The long snout would have allowed the animal to cross deeper swamps walking, catching breath on the water's surface and the heavy frill would have acted as a counterbalance to help point the beak upwards. Later paleontologists tended to reject this notion, emphasizing that dinosaurs in general were land animals, but in 2012 Mallon again suggested a semi-aquatic lifestyle, like a modern hippopotamus, at least for specimen NMC 8547.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Arsenic and cadmium {{are widely}} {{distributed}} {{in nature and}} pose serious threats {{to the environment and}} human health. Exposure to these nonessential toxic metals may result in a variety of human diseases including cancer. However, arsenic and cadmium toxicity targets and the cellular systems contributing to tolerance acquisition are not fully known. RESULTS: To gain insight into metal action and cellular tolerance mechanisms, we carried out genome-wide screening of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae haploid and homozygous diploid deletion mutant collections and scored for reduced growth in the presence of arsenite or cadmium. Processes found to be required for tolerance to both metals included sulphur and glutathione biosynthesis, environmental sensing, mRNA synthesis and transcription, and vacuolar/endosomal transport and sorting. We also identified metal-specific defence processes. Arsenite-specific <b>defence</b> <b>functions</b> were related to cell cycle regulation, lipid and fatty acid metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and the cytoskeleton whereas cadmium-specific <b>defence</b> <b>functions</b> were mainly related to sugar/carbohydrate metabolism, and metal-ion homeostasis and transport. Molecular evidence indicated that the cytoskeleton is targeted by arsenite and that phosphorylation of the Snf 1 p kinase is required for cadmium tolerance. CONCLUSION: This study has pin-pointed core functions that protect cells from arsenite and cadmium toxicity. It also emphasizes the existence of both common and specific defence systems. Since many of the yeast genes that confer tolerance to these agents have homologues in humans, similar biological processes may act in yeast and humans to prevent metal toxicity and carcinogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Multiple organ {{dysfunction}} syndrome is a dominant cause of mortality {{in the intensive}} care unit. Experimentally, a condition similar to the multiple {{organ dysfunction}} syndrome can be induced by the intraperitoneal injection of sterile zymosan. In the present study we investigate potential alterations in multiple organ functions, endothelial permeability, and antiproteinases after intraperitoneal injection of zymosan at various doses. Zymosan-induced generalized inflammation lead to endothelial barrier injury in multiple organs/tissues, a decrease in systemic arterial pressure, impaired organ function and gut <b>defence</b> <b>function,</b> and consumption of protease inhibitors, particularly the consumption of alpha (2) antiplasmin. Endothelial barrier injury appears to present a dose- and organ-dependent pattern in multiple organs/tissues, and the increase in endothelial barrier permeability occurred prior to organ dysfunction.

40|$|AbstractIsolated {{invasive}} Aspergillus tracheobronchitis (iIATB) is {{an uncommon}} clinical form of invasive Aspergillosis in which Aspergillus infection is limited entirely or predominantly to the tracheobronchial tree. In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed {{the medical records}} of 19 patients who had histological documented iIATB in the Department of Respiratory Medicine of Changhai Hospital between October 2000 and February 2008. Malignancy {{was the most common}} underlying disease, which existed in 14 patients (73. 7 %) in our series. Most patients had impaired airway structures or <b>defence</b> <b>functions,</b> whereas the systemic immune status was relatively normal. Only three patients (15. 8 %) had neutropenia. The clinical manifestations and chest radiograph were non-specific. We classified iIATB into four different forms according to the bronchoscopic features of intraluminal lesions: superficial infiltration type (Type I, n = 4), full-layer involvement type (Type II, n = 2), occlusion type (Type III, n = 6) and mixed type (Type IV, n = 7). Type IV was the largest group in our study, followed by Type III. All patients with iIATB of Type IV had definite airway occlusion. Fourteen patients (73. 7 %) had a good response to antifungal treatments and five (26. 3 %) {{died as a result of}} the progression of Aspergillosis, all of whom had full-layer invasion of the involved bronchi. In conclusion, we found that iIATB could occur in moderately or non-immunocompromised patients with impaired airway structures or <b>defence</b> <b>functions</b> and may be an early period of invasive pulmonary Aspergillosis. Most of the iIATB patients had a favourable prognosis with early diagnosis and effective antifungal treatment. The morphological features of intraluminal lesions might be of prognostic value...|$|R

40|$|Sepsis {{associated}} coagulopathy {{is due to}} the inflammation-induced {{activation of}} coagulation pathways concomitant with dysfunction of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic systems, leading to different degrees of haemostasis dysregulation. This response is initially beneficial, contributing to antimicrobial defence, but when control is lost coagulation activation leads to widespread microvascular thrombosis and subsequent organ failure. Large clinical trials of sepsis-related anticoagulant therapies failed to show survival benefits, but posthoc analysis of databases and several smaller studies showed beneficial effects of anticoagulants in subgroups of patients with early sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation. A reasonable explanation could be the difference in timing of anticoagulant therapy and patient heterogeneity associated with large trials. Proper selection of patients and adequate timing are required for treatment to be successful. The time when coagulation activation changes from advantageous to detrimental represents the right moment for the administration of coagulation-targeted therapy. In this way, the <b>defence</b> <b>function</b> of the haemostatic system is preserved, and the harmful effects of overwhelming coagulation activation are avoided...|$|E
40|$|Pathogenic {{diseases}} impose selection {{pressures on}} the social behaviour of host populations. In humans (Homo sapiens), many psychological phenomena appear to serve an antipathogen <b>defence</b> <b>function.</b> One broad implication is the existence of cross-cultural differences in human cognition and behaviour contingent upon the relative presence of pathogens in the local ecology. We focus specifically on one fundamental cultural variable: differences in individualistic versus collectivist values. We suggest that specific behavioural manifestations of collectivism (e. g. ethnocentrism, conformity) can inhibit the transmission of pathogens; and so we hypothesize that collectivism (compared with individualism) will more often characterize cultures in regions that have historically had higher prevalence of pathogens. Drawing on epidemiological data and the findings of worldwide cross-national surveys of individualism/collectivism, our results support this hypothesis: the regional prevalence of pathogens has a strong positive correlation with cultural indicators of collectivism and a strong negative correlation with individualism. The correlations remain significant even when controlling for potential confounding variables. These results help to explain the origin of a paradigmatic cross-cultural difference, and reveal previously undocumented consequences of pathogenic diseases on the variable nature of human societies. ...|$|E

The study of the interplay between salt marsh vegetation growth, sedimentary processes and dynamic tidal and wave processes {{has led to a}} growing recognition of the importance of bio-physical factors determining coastal landform evolution. An increased focus on bio-physical linkages that control coastal wetland functioning can also be seen in the conservation, engineering, and policy sector, due to a rising awareness of the value of coastal wetlands due to the services they provide to society. The role of salt marshes as natural sea defences is increasingly significant in the context of ever increasing coastal population densities alongside environmental pressures (e. g. sea level rise and increasing storm frequencies arising from climate change, alongside ever increasing coastal population densities). This talk reviews how advances in field, laboratory, and numerical modeling approaches have made particular inroads into the quantification of the sea defence role of coastal wetlands.
