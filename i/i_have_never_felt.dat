500|$|Secretariat raced in Meadow Stables' blue-and-white-checkered colors. He never raced {{in track}} bandages, but {{typically}} wore a blinker hood, mostly {{to help him}} focus, but also {{because he had a}} tendency to run in towards the rail during races. In January 1972, he joined trainer Lucien Laurin's winter stable at Hialeah. Secretariat gained a reputation as a kind horse, likeable and unruffled in crowds or by the bumping that occurs between young horses. He had the physique of a runner, but at first was awkward and clumsy. He was frequently outpaced by more precocious stable mates, running a quarter-mile in 26 seconds compared to 23 seconds by his peers. His regular exercise riders were Jim Gaffney and Charlie Davis. Davis was not initially impressed. [...] "He was a big fat sucker", Davis said. [...] "I mean, he was big. He wasn't in a hurry to do nothin'. He took his time. The quality was there, but he didn't show it until he wanted to." [...] Gaffney though recalled his first ride on Secretariat in early 1972 as [...] "having this big red machine under me, and from that very first day I knew he had a power of strength that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> before..." ...|$|E
500|$|At 21:30 on 12 September, the Japanese cruiser [...] {{and three}} destroyers shelled the Lunga {{perimeter}} for 20 minutes and illuminated the ridge with a searchlight. Japanese artillery began shelling the Marine lines, but did little damage. At the same time, scattered groups of Kawaguchi's troops began skirmishing with Marines around the ridge. Kawaguchi's 1st Battalion—led by Major Yukichi Kokusho—attacked the Raider's [...] "C" [...] company between the lagoon and the Lunga River, overrunning {{at least one}} platoon and forcing the Marine company to fall back to the ridge. Kokusho's unit became entangled with troops from Kawaguchi's 3rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Kusukichi Watanabe, who were still struggling to reach their attack positions, and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the Japanese attack on the ridge that night. Kawaguchi, who was having trouble locating where he was {{in relation to the}} U.S. Marine lines as well as coordinating his troops' attacks, later complained, [...] "Due to the devilish jungle, the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control. In my whole life <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> so disappointed and helpless." [...] Twelve U.S. Marines were killed; Japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater. Although both Oka in the west and the Kuma unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that night, they failed to make contact and halted near the Marine lines at dawn.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{called his}} U.S.-based {{advisers}} to his Texas ranch for discussions on Christmas Day. Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara advised Johnson to reject Taylor's proposal. Johnson declined to act, stating that an escalation during the Christmas period would be inappropriate, {{as it would}} damage public morale. He also noted {{that because of the}} political instability in Saigon, the international community and the American public were unlikely to believe that the Vietcong were behind the attack, feeling that they would instead blame local infighting for the bombing. This was {{despite the fact that the}} Vietcong had already claimed responsibility. Johnson administration officials concluded four days after the bombing that the Vietcong were responsible. Johnson believed that it was too late to retaliate and that any action taken more than 36 hours after the event constituted unprovoked aggression. The State Department cabled Taylor and the embassy, saying that [...] "In view of the overall confusion in Saigon", public U.S. and international opinion towards an American air strike would be that the Johnson administration was [...] "trying to shoot its way out of an internal [...] political crisis". Johnson said to Taylor that [...] "Every time I get a military recommendation it seems to me that it calls for large-scale bombing. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> that this war will be won from the air." [...] At the time, Johnson was reluctant to accede to his officials' calls for large-scale bombing of North Vietnam, a strategy that eventually became policy.|$|E

2500|$|The murders {{committed}} by John Christie were dramatised in the 1971 film 10 Rillington Place, {{in which he}} was portrayed by Richard Attenborough, who spoke of his ambivalence concerning the role: [...] "I do not like playing the part, but I accepted it at once without seeing the script. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> so totally involved in any part as this. It is a most devastating statement on capital punishment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goldmann {{found the}} Jewish {{leadership}} in the U.S. divided, with no cohesive policy in place {{at a time when}} unity of [...] "intention and purpose was vital." [...] Deeply frustrated over this divided leadership, he said:'In all my years in Jewish politics, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> so impotent, so grimly bitter as I did over this. All of us who speak for the Jewish people in those days—and I emphatically include myself—bear a share of the guilt.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{appearing}} {{regularly for}} England in FIFA World Cup qualifying matches and friendly matches, Defoe was not {{named in the}} provisional England squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany and named only on a five-man standby list. He joined the squad for training in Germany, but returned to England when Wayne Rooney was cleared to play after having suffered a foot injury in April. He confessed that he was baffled by his omission, saying, [...] "I've been involved in every squad {{for the last two}} years and feel I've played a part in helping us to qualify. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> fitter and sharper than I was in training and believe I could have scored goals in the tournament. It's a strange decision and everybody I speak to thinks so as well." [...] Eriksson explained why Defoe was not selected for the England squad: [...] "Jermain had a very bad season. I don't think he deserved to go to the World Cup." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{moment was}} over and passed. Mr. Parker, with a {{movement}} forward, had covered my proceedings. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been {{face to face with}} death years before, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> quite the same thrill.|$|R

60|$|The {{freshness}} of her beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable majesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in it, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen before; what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen before, was the saddened, softened {{light of the}} once proud eyes; what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> before was the friendly touch of the once insensible hand.|$|R

500|$|During {{her senior}} year of high school, Howard learned of existentialism. [...] "I was like, 'This is it!

It was very basic – you're responsible for the choices that you make – but it was mind-blowing at the time." ...|$|R
60|$|I cleared that {{kitchen and}} the pantry adjoining. It was ten o'clock when I got through, and Alexander Abraham {{had gone to bed}} without deigning further speech. I locked Mr. Riley in one room and William Adolphus in another and went to bed, too. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> so dead tired in my life before. It had been a hard day.|$|R
60|$|I {{read some}} shorter stories of Tolstoy's before I {{came to this}} {{greatest}} work of his: I read 'Scenes of the Siege of Sebastopol,' which is {{so much of the}} same quality as 'War and Peace;' and I read 'Policoushka' and most of his short stories with a sense of my unity with their people such as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> with the people of other fiction.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> such {{pity for}} any one in this wide world as I felt for that half-witted creature, and it began to come over me that the brig Covenant (for all her pious name) was little better than a hell upon the seas.|$|E
60|$|The {{quietness}} of {{this evening}} circle, the charm of its kind hospitality, the evident air of sincerity and good will which pervaded every thing, made the evening pass most delightfully to me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> myself more at home even among the Quakers. Such a visit is a true rest and refreshment, a thousand times better than the most brilliant and glittering entertainment.|$|R
60|$|I {{knew that}} it would be best that I should leave England; but there seemed to have grown within me, suddenly, a yearning towards my own country that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> before--a home-sickness for the land in which my sister lived. Not once did my {{thoughts}} wander away to foreign places, while I now tried to consider calmly in what direction I should depart when I left London.|$|R
5000|$|During mid-2013, Kelly's newly {{assigned}} manager Scooter Braun {{introduced her}} to the heads of Capitol Records. She had been [...] "very skeptical" [...] about signing with a major record label in fear that things would not work out in her favor. [...] "I'd been burned before. But when I met those guys, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> that way: They were fans and really got me." [...] On September 6, 2013 she was signed to Capitol Records.|$|R

6000|$|While he spoke, {{the tone}} of his voice, the light of his now affectionate eye, gave me such a {{pleasure}} as, certainly, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt.</b> <b>I</b> envied no girl her lover, no bride her bridegroom, no wife her husband; I was content with this my voluntary, self-offering friend.

60|$|I awoke, {{suddenly}} and unaccountably, {{from a deep}} and dreamless sleep with an all-pervading sensation of nervous uneasiness which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> before.

From the moment when my head was on the pillow <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> known what it was to awake until the maid knocked at my door. At all seasons and times the long and uninterrupted repose of a child was the repose that I enjoyed.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> so like a {{passenger}} before. I thanked him, with emotion, for each new fact, and {{wrote it down}} in my note-book. The pilot warmed to his opportunity, and proceeded to load {{me up in the}} good old-fashioned way. At times I was afraid he was going to rupture his invention; but it always stood the strain, and he pulled through all right. He drifted, by easy stages, into revealments of the river's marvelous eccentricities of one sort and another, and backed them up with some pretty gigantic illustrations. For instance-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] she chattered on, [...] "I don't {{really know}} what spies do. One reads about them in these silly stories, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> sure that as live people they exist at all. Tell me, Count, what could a foreign spy do in England?" ...|$|E
6000|$|...

60|$|The {{next moment}} his arm was again round me. I clung {{to him as}} to a rock, for of a truth <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> a grasp so steady and withal so gentle and kindly, as was his around my shoulders. I tried to murmur words of thanks, but again that wretched feeling of {{sickness}} and faintness overcame me, {{and for a second}} or two it seemed to me as if I were slipping into another world. The stranger's voice came to my ear, as it were through cotton-wool.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, {{whatever}} may be {{the truth}} regarding her, I shall not trouble my head about her; for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> yet <b>felt</b> what men call love, and I feel sure I never shall." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{dropped the}} letter and sat {{motionless}} for a long time. Then I wrote my answer (it was a short one) and went ashore myself to post it. But I passed one letter-box, then another, {{and in the end}} found myself going up Collins Street with the letter still in my pocket--against my heart. Collins Street at four o'clock in the afternoon is not exactly a desert solitude; but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> more isolated from the rest of mankind as when I walked that day its crowded pavement, battling desperately with my thoughts and feeling already vanquished.|$|R
