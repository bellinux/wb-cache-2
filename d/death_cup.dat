50|$|The prince, now in {{possession}} of Surya and the holy grail, {{is about to be}} married to Surya, but he's interrupted by the attack of Austin, a military man and the father of Jodie, the woman whom the prince killed. The prince manages to escape with Surya and the grail, but is soon followed by Austin, Yakko, Ryu and Dr. Aikawa. With the help of the grail, the prince opens a portal to Shambhala and enters it. He is soon followed by Ryu and Yakko, who find a space egg floating like a sun. During this time, Dr. Aikawa finds another way of entering Shambhala, by using the holy grail counterpart, a <b>death</b> <b>cup,</b> and a foursome sexual position in a wall of a Lakshmana temple. As the prince is about to enter the egg with princess Shurya and the grail, Dr. Aikawa, Shakty, Yukari and Hige appear before him. Soon after, Ryu and Yakko also arrive and Ryu manages to catch up to the prince just as he enters the egg with Shurya. The prince and Ryu engage in a battle, in which the holy grail falls outside the egg. They are stopped by the angels that protect the egg, just as the egg elevates itself towards the space.|$|E
40|$|The basidiolipids of six {{mushroom}} species, i. e. the basidiomycetes Amanita virosa (engl., <b>death</b> <b>cup),</b> Calvatia exipuliformis (engl., puffball), Cantharellus cibarius (engl., chanterelle), Leccinum scabrum (engl., red birch boletus), Lentinus edodes (jap., Shiitake), and Pleurotus ostreatus (engl., oystermushroom), were isolated, {{and their}} chemical structures investigated. All glycolipids are structurally related {{to those of}} the Agaricales (engl., field mushroom). They are glycoinositolphosphosphingolipids, their ceramide moiety consisting of t 18 : 0 -trihydroxysphinganine and an α-hydroxy long-chain fatty acid. In contrast to a previous study [Jennemann, R., Bauer, B. L., Bertalanffy, H., Geyer, R., Gschwind, R. M., Selmer, T. & Wiegandt, H. (1999) Eur. J. Biochem. 259, 331 – 338], the glycoside anomery of the hexose (mannose) connected to the inositol of all investigated basidiomycete glycolipids, including the basidiolipids of Agaricus bisporus, was determined unequivocally to be alpha. Therefore, the root structure of all basidiolipids consists of α-dManp- 2 Ins 1 -[PO 4]-Cer. In addition, for some mushroom species, the occurrence of an inositol substitution position variant, α-Manp- 4 Ins 1 -[PO 4]-Cer, is shown. The carbohydrate of chanterelle basidiolipids consists solely of mannose, i. e. Cc 1, Manα- 3 or - 6 Manα; Cc 2, Manα- 3 (Manα- 6) Manα-. All other species investigated show extension of the α-mannoside in the 6 -position by β-galactoside, which, in some instances, is α-fucosylated in 2 -position (Fucα- 2) Galβ- 6 Manα-. Further sugar chain elongation at the β-galactoside may be in 3 - and/or 6 -position by α-galactoside, e. g. Ce 4, Po 2, Galα- 3 ‐(Galα- 6) (Fucα- 2) Galβ- 6 Manα-, whereas A. virosa, Av- 3, has a more complex, highly α-fucosylated terminus, Galα- 3 (Fucα- 2) (Fucα- 6) Galα- 2 (Galα- 3) Galβ- 6 Manα-. L. edodes basidiolipids show further elongation by α-mannoside, e. g. Le 3, Manα- 2 Manα- 6 Galα- 3 (Fucα- 2) Galβ- 6 Manα-, C. exipuliformis glycolipid by α-glucoside, i. e. Ce 3, Glcα- 6 Galβ- 6 Manα-. Basidiolipid Ls 1 from L. scabrum, notably, has a 3 -α-mannosylated α-fucose, i. e. Galα- 6 (Manα- 3 Fucα- 2) Galα- 6 Galβ- 6 Manα-. In conclusion, basidiolipids, though identical in their ceramide constitution, display wide and systematic mushroom species dependent variabilities of their chemical structures...|$|E

40|$|Cancer {{of unknown}} primary (CUP) is {{diagnosed}} at the metastatic stage. We aimed to identify hidden primary cancers in CUP patients {{by comparison with}} cancers in family members. We take use {{of the fact that}} the cause of <b>death</b> in <b>CUP</b> patients is often coded as the cancer in the organ of fatal metastasis. Forty-one thousand five hundred and twenty-three CUP patients were identified in the Swedish Family-Cancer Database, and relative risks (RRs) were calculated for cancer in offspring when family members were diagnosed with CUP and died of the cancer diagnosed in offspring. The RR for lung cancer in offspring was 1. 85 when a family member was diagnosed with CUP and died of lung cancer. Significant familial associations were found for seven other cancers. Many familial associations were also significant when offspring CUP patients died of the cancer diagnosed in family members. The cause of <b>death</b> after <b>CUP</b> diagnosis frequently matched the cancer found in a family member, suggesting that the CUP had originated in that tissue. The metastasis had probably undergone a phenotypic change, complicating pathological tissue assignment. These novel data suggest that some CUP cases are phenotypically modified primary cancers rather than cancers of unknown primaries...|$|R

40|$|We {{established}} and validated an in toto method to perform TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling to study apoptosis in human trabecular meshwork tissue obtained during trabeculectomy in glaucoma patients. In specimens from patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and primary angle-closure glaucoma, we detected {{a tendency for}} more apoptotic cells to accumulate in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. The utility of this method to study apoptosis in the trabecular meshwork is discussed, {{as well as its}} application as a tool in biologic samples. Glaucoma {{is one of the most}} common causes of blindness in the world and it is a progressive optic neuropathy that provokes the loss of vision [1]. Glaucoma is characterized by retinal ganglion cell <b>death</b> and <b>cupping</b> of the optic disc. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of the disease and it is closely associated with an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) that results from an excessive resistance to the outflow of the aqueous humor (AH) through the conventional pathway [2]. This pathway involves both the trabecular meshwork (TM) and Schlemm’s canal (SC); th...|$|R

Now that the Duke of Pei (Liu Bang) had subjugated Qin and occupied Xianyang, he did not harm the people, but instead sealed the palace and moved his army to Bashang to await your arrival. The reason why he sent troops to guard the passes is because bandits are rampant around this area. Such is the hard work he has done, but he has yet to receive any reward.

40|$|Universally, {{it is an}} {{estimation}} that 60 million {{individuals with}} glaucomatous optic neuropathy. In addition, {{there are an estimated}} 8. 4 million glaucomatous patients who are blind. These patients are expected to increase to 80 million and 11. 2 million by the year 2020. Statistically, glaucoma has been considered as the second leading cause of blindness in the world [1]. The universal definition of glaucoma is that it is an optic neuropathy with assorted etiology, which disturbs the optic nerve head, thereby resulting in visual loss and permanent impairment of visual function [2]. On the other hand, primary open angle glaucoma is an optic neuropathy that is commonly associated with increased intraocular pressure.

40|$|Background: Cancer {{of unknown}} primary (CUP) is a fatal cancer, {{accounting}} for 3 - 5 % of all diagnosed cancers. Finding the primary site {{is important for}} therapeutic choices {{and we believe that}} the organ which is designated as the cause of death may give clues about the primary site. Methods: A total of 20, 570 patients with CUP were identified from the Swedish Family-Cancer Database. Causes of death - as reported in the death certificate - were investigated, analyzing reported metastatic sites and histological subtypes separately. Survival was compared with metastatic cancer with a known primary tumor. Results: An organ-specific cancer could be identified as a cause of death in approximately 60 % of all CUP patients with adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated histology. In adenocarcinoma, lung cancer was the most frequent cause of death (20 %), followed by pancreatic cancer (14 %), and ovarian cancer (11 %). Lung cancer was {{the most common cause of}} death in patients with CUP metastases diagnosed in the nervous system (69 %), respiratory system (53 %), and bone (47 %), whereas ovarian cancer was the most common cause of <b>death</b> when <b>CUP</b> was diagnosed in the pelvis (47 %) or the peritoneum (32 %). In CUP diagnosed in the liver, liver and pancreatic cancers accounted for 26 % and 22 % of deaths, respectively. Also in squamous cell CUP, lung cancer was the most common cause of death (45 %). Conclusions: According to the causes of death, the primary site appeared frequently to be either the organ where CUP metastases were diagnosed or an organ which may be traced through the known metastatic patterns of different cancer types...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cancer {{of unknown}} primary site (CUP) is {{considered}} an aggressive metastatic disease but whether the prognosis differs from metastatic cancers of known primary site is not known. Such data may give insight into the biology of CUP and the metastatic process in general. Methods 6, 745 cancer patients, with primary metastatic cancer at diagnosis, were identified from the Swedish Cancer Registry, and were compared with 2, 881 patients with CUP. Patients were diagnosed and died between 2002 and 2008. The influence of the primary site, known or unknown, on survival in patients with metastases at specific locations was investigated. Hazard ratios (HRs) of death were estimated for several sites of metastasis, where patients with known primary sites were compared with CUP patients. Results Overall, patients with metastatic cancers with known primary sites had decreased hazards of <b>death</b> compared to <b>CUP</b> patients (HR[*]=[*] 0. 69 [95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 66 – 0. 72]). The exceptions were cancer of the pancreas (1. 71 [1. 54 – 1. 90]), liver (1. 58 [1. 36 – 1. 85]), and stomach (1. 16 [1. 02 – 1. 31]). For individual metastatic sites, patients with liver or bone metastases of known origin had better survival than those with CUP of the liver and bone. Patients with liver metastases of pancreatic origin had {{an increased risk of}} death compared with patients with CUP of the liver (1. 25 [1. 06 – 1. 46]). The median survival time of CUP patients was three months. Conclusions Patients with CUP have poorer survival than patients with known primaries, except those with brain and respiratory system metastases. Of CUP sites, liver metastases had the worst prognosis. Survival in CUP was comparable to that in metastatic lung cancer. The aggressive behavior of CUP may be due to initial immunosuppression and immunoediting which may allow accumulation of mutations. Upon escape from the suppressed state an unstoppable tumor spread ensues. These novel data on the epidemiology of the metastatic process at the population level demonstrated large survival differences in organ defined metastases depending on the original cancer. </p...|$|R
