GAO focused on why the program data showed <b>heroin</b> <b>seizure</b> information for only one U. S. Pacific Coast international airport. In addition, GAO examined whether enough samples from heroin seizures were being furnished for analysis under the Heroin Signature Program {{and the extent to}} which DEA was committed to the Domestic Monitor Program. GAO concluded that the discrepancies in the 1999 statistical data generated by the programs were the result of the two programs' data not being comparable. The reason Heroin Signature Program data showed <b>heroin</b> <b>seizure</b> information for only one U. S. Pacific Coast international airport was because seizures at other Pacific Coast airports during 1999 did not meet federal prosecution guidelines. GAO further found that DEA officials responsible for administering the Heroin Signature Program received enough samples of the heroin seized by federal law enforcement agencies, but did not receive enough samples from state and local law enforcement agencies. Additionally, DEA was committed to the Domestic Monitor Program and did annual field division inspections, which included verification of compliance with Domestic Monitor Program requirements. ...|$|E

This study aimed to determine the onset, peak and decline of the heroin shortage in New South Wales (NSW), using the most appropriate available methods to detect market level changes. The parameters of the heroin shortage were determined by reviewing: reports of heroin users about availability and price (derived from the existing literature and the Illicit Drug Reporting System); qualitative interviews with injecting drug users, and health and law enforcement professionals working in the illicit drug field; and examining data on <b>heroin</b> <b>seizures</b> over the past decade. There was a marked reduction in heroin supply in NSW in early 2001. An increase in the price of heroin occurred in 2001, whereas it had decreased steadily since 1996.

40|$|Measuring {{the success}} of drug law {{enforcement}} by the quantity of drugs seized can be deceptive, simply because the amount seized may increase because {{the size of the}} drug market has also increased, rather than because of any increased success of drug law enforcement.

The application of this method of analyzing <b>heroin</b> <b>seizures</b> in the years before the heroin shortage in Australia in 2001 reveals that drug law enforcement was an unlikely cause of the 2001 heroin shortage. The most likely explanation for the heroin shortage was a severe disjunction between the rapidly growing demand for heroin in Australia coupled with the significant decline in heroin production in Southeast Asia due to the drought in Burma and a general move away from heroin production towards methamphetamine production...|$|R

40|$|Drug law {{enforcement}} aims {{to reduce the}} consumption of illicit drugs through reducing supply and increasing prices. Data on cocaine and <b>heroin</b> <b>seizures,</b> prices, and methods of trafficking are presented for 1983 – 93.

Data on the primary means of transport of cocaine and heroin into Europe lends support to an explanation of the price patterns in terms of the risk factors these impose for traffickers. The nature of the trafficking, and the mechanism by which enforcement of trafficking laws is intended to impact upon the problem, suggest that the rapid substitution of interdictedtraffickers androutes is highly likely, and that present levels of enforcement will have little deterrent or preventive impact.

40|$|AbstractHeroin {{continues}} to be the main drug used in Malaysia, whereas amphetamine-type stimulants (ATSs, such as ecstasy, syabu, and yaba) have been recently identified as a growing problem. A cumulative total of 300, 241 drug users were detected between 1988 and 2006. It is also estimated that Malaysia has 170, 000 injecting drug users. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence among drug users in the country ranges from 25 % to 45 %. Currently, there are approximately 380 general medical practice offices that offer agonist maintenance treatments for approximately 10, 000 patients. There are 27, 756 active patients in 333 general medical practice offices and government-run methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) centers. The needle syringe exchange program reached out to 34, 244 injection drug users in 2011. In the past 2 years (2011 and 2012) the number of detected drug addicts decreased from 11, 194 to 9015. The arrests made by the police related to opiate and cannabis use increased from 41, 363 to 63, 466 between the years 2008 and 2010, but decreased since 2010. An almost four-fold {{increase in the number of}} ATS and ketamine users was detected from 2006 (21, 653 users) to 2012 (76, 812). Between 2004 and 2010, the yearly <b>seizures</b> for <b>heroin</b> ranged from 156  kg to 270  kg. However, in 2010 and 2011, <b>heroin</b> <b>seizures</b> showed a significant increase of 445  kg and 410. 02  kg, respectively. There has been a seizure of 600 – 1000  kg of syabu yearly from 2009 to 2012. Similar to <b>heroin,</b> increased <b>seizures</b> for yaba have also been observed over the past 2 years. A significant increase has also been recorded for the seizures of ecstasy pills from 2011 (47, 761 pills) to 2012 (634, 573 pills). The cumulative number of reported HIV infections since 1986 is 94, 841. In 2011, sexual activity superseded injection drug use as the main transmission factor for the epidemic. HIV in the country mainly involves males, as they constitute 90 % of cumulative HIV cases and a majority of those individuals are IDUs. However, HIV infection trends are shifting from males to females. There are 37, 306 people living with HIV who are eligible for treatment, and 14, 002 people living with HIV were receiving antiretroviral treatment in 2011. The decreasing trend of heroin users who have been detected and arrested could be due to the introduction of medical treatments and harm reduction approaches for drug users, resulting in fewer drug users being arrested. However, we are unable to say with certainty why there has been an increase in <b>heroin</b> <b>seizures</b> in the country. There has been an increasing trend in both ATS users and seizures. A new trend of concurrent opiate dependence and ATS underscores the need to develop and implement effective treatments for ATS, concurrent opiate and ATS, and polysubstance abuse disorders. The low numbers of needle syringe exchange program clients being tested for HIV underscores our caution in interpreting the decline of HIV infections among drug users and the importance of focusing on providing education, prevention, treatment, and outreach to those who are not in treatment...|$|R
50|$|Drug {{markets have}} changed {{considerably}} since the 1980s; greater competition, and {{a shift from}} highly structured (and thus controlled) to greatly fragmented markets, has generated competition among dealers in terms of purity. Many drugs that reach the street are now only cut at the manufacture/producer stage, {{and this may be}} more a matter of lacing the drug with another substance designed to appeal to the consumer, as opposed to simple diluents that increase the profit for the seller. The extent of cutting can vary significantly over time but for the last 15 years drugs such as heroin and cocaine have often sat at the 50% purity level. Heroin purity sitting at 50% does not mean 50% cutting agents; other adulterants could include other opiate by-products of making heroin from opium. Coomber (1997d), after having street <b>heroin</b> <b>seizures</b> from the UK re-analysed, reported that nearly 50% of the samples had no cutting agents present at all. This means that 50% of street heroin in the UK in 1995 had worked its way from producer to user without being cut at any stage, although other adulterants may have been present. Other research by Coomber (1997b) outlined how drug dealers have other ways of making profit without having to resort to cutting the drugs they sell.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the role played by heroin purity in fatal heroin overdoses, time series analyses were conducted on the purity of street <b>heroin</b> <b>seizures</b> in south western Sydney and overdose fatalities in that region. A total of 322 heroin samples were analysed in fortnightly periods between February 1993 to January 1995. A total of 61 overdose deaths occurred in the region in the study period. Cross correlation plots revealed a significant correlation of 0. 57 at time lag zero between mean purity of heroin samples per fortnight and number of overdose fatalities. Similarly, there was a significant correlation of 0. 50 at time lag zero between the highest heroin purity per fortnight and number of overdose fatalities. The correlation between range of heroin purity and number of deaths per fortnight was 0. 40. A simultaneous multiple regression on scores adjusted for first order correlation indicated both the mean level of heroin purity and the range of heroin purity were independent predictors of the number of deaths per fortnight. The results indicate that the occurrence of overdose fatalities was moderately associated with both the average heroin purity and the range of heroin purity over the study period.

40|$|Heroin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{dangerous}} abused drugs in the world. Tramadol is an additive recently found at high concentration levels in street <b>heroin</b> <b>seizures</b> in Egypt. This substance could affect the usual analytical method for the detection of heroin and metabolites, as well as the pharmacokinetic and disposition of single analytes. One shortfall regarding this issue is present in the literature. This study describes a validated, simple, sensitive and selective method to determine tramadol, O-desmethyltramadol, 6 -acetylmorphine and free morphine in the blood, brain, liver and kidney of Wistar rats, intraperitoneally treated with a combination of heroin and tramadol (10 and 70 mg/kg, respectively) using liquid–liquid extraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry detection. The calibration curves of tramadol, O-desmethyltramadol and 6 -acetylmorphine in blood were linear in the concentration range from 25 – 5, 000 ng/mL and morphine was found in the concentration range 50 – 5, 000 ng/ mL. The analytes were detected in all tested matrices, except 6 -acetylmorphine, which was not detected in liver. The highest concentrations of tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol were observed in kidney (22, 9381 and 28, 498 ng/g), while 6 -acetylmorphine and morphine were found at the highest levels in brain (3, 280 and 3, 899 ng/g, respectively).

40|$|The main {{types of}} illicit drugs covered {{in this report}} are {{examined}} in relative isolation from each other, though some cross-over does occur. The aims of this chapter are therefore, first, to provide {{a snapshot of the}} illicit drug situation in Australia, and second, to provide insight into the interplay between the markets for various drugs. Considered in isolation, specific market indicators for each drug type can mean very little, but viewed collectively they provide a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions and interdependencies within the Australian illicit drug market. While the 2001 – 02 reporting period saw little change in the dynamics of the illicit drug market in Australia, several trends worth noting were identified. One significant trend was the continuing fall in arrests for heroin-related offences which dropped to well below 1996 levels while domestic <b>heroin</b> <b>seizures</b> continued to decline—both have been exacerbated by the ongoing effects of the heroin shortage (Figures 1. 1 and 1. 2 respectively.) Although a number of research studies suggest traditional heroin users are consuming alternative drugs to substitute for the continuing lack of heroin, this pattern is not supported by the arrest data for the 2001 – 02 period.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{still are}} {{concerns}} about unwanted effects of harm-reduction measures {{that may lead}} to an increasing number of new heroin users. Furthermore, it is thought that the admission of a substantial proportion of heroin users to methadone treatments reduces the demand on the heroin market and thus results in a lower price for street heroin. And finally, the intensity of police activity in the drug field may also affect prices for street heroin. METHODS: As incidence of regular heroin use over more than a decade is rarely known elsewhere, we examined the Zurich experience between 1980 and 2005 by triangulating published and unpublished data, concerning heroin price, heroin purity level, <b>heroin</b> <b>seizures</b> and drug offences. This time period encompasses the time before and after the introduction of low-threshold methadone treatment in 1991. RESULTS: We found a steep peak of heroin incidence in 1990. The street price of heroin already declined from 700 to 60 Swiss Francs during the 80 s. The number of heroin consumptions possession offences reported by the police increased since 1991 and peaked in 1997, 2 years after the closure of the last open drug scene. CONCLUSION: The introduction of low-threshold methadone treatment has not resulted in lower heroin prices and the increased police activity during the 90 s has not led to higher heroin prices, even though the higher police activity in the late 90 s {{may have contributed to the}} prevention of a re-establishment of open drug scenes.

Over the last decade, cannabis has remained the dominant illicit drug in the Australian market in terms of use, seizures and arrests. Other prominent drug types in the Australian market are amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) and ‘other and unknown’ drugs. The number of illicit drugs seized nationally continues to increase, with 76 083 seizures in 2011 – 12, the highest reported in the last decade. Illicit drug related arrests are also the highest reported in the last decade, with 93 148 arrests in 2011 – 12. In 2011 – 12, a record 23. 8 tonnes of illicit drugs were seized nationally, a 154 per cent increase from the 9. 3 tonnes seized in 2010 – 11. A single 11 tonne seizure of hypophosphorous acid 2 in New South Wales contributed to this significant increase in weight. As a direct consequence of this seizure, other and unknown drugs accounts for 56. 8 per cent of the weight of national illicit drug seizures this reporting period.

The chemiluminescence reagents (acidic potassium permanganate and tris(2, 2 ′-bipyridine) ruthenium(III)) were aspirated from either side of a sample aliquot that was sufficiently large to prevent interdispersion of the reagent zones, and therefore two different chemical reactions could be performed simultaneously {{at either end of the}} sample zone. The presence of <b>heroin</b> in <b>seizure</b> samples was indicated by a strong response with the tris(2, 2 ′-bipyridine) ruthenium(III) reagent and confirmed by a significant increase in the response with the permanganate reagent when the sample was treated with sodium hydroxide to hydrolyse the heroin to morphine. Nicomorphine (a morphine-derived pharmaceutical) was synthesised and tested under the same conditions. The responses with the permanganate reagent were similar to those for heroin, which supports the proposed chemical basis for the test.

The Australian Drug Trends 2002 report presents {{the findings of the}} third year in which the complete IDRS has been conducted in every Australian jurisdiction. Detailed reports on drug trends within each jurisdiction can be obtained from the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC). The IDRS monitors the price, purity, availability and patterns of use of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and cannabis. Drug trends in this publication are cited by jurisdiction, although they primarily represent trends in the capital city of each jurisdiction, in which new drug trends are likely to emerge. Key findings from the 2002 IDRS 1. Compared to the 2001 IDRS the availability of heroin increased in most jurisdictions, particularly in those in which heroin has traditionally predominated. The price of a gram of heroin decreased in all jurisdictions except SA, whereas the price of a cap of heroin remained stable. Heroin remained cheapest in NSW and most expensive in the NT. The purity and number of <b>heroin</b> <b>seizures</b> analysed has decreased. 2. The 2002 IDRS attempted to obtain more information on the different forms of methamphetamine used throughout the country. All forms of methamphetamine remained cheapest in SA. Methamphetamine powder and base were considered to be easy to obtain and the availability stable. Crystal methamphetamine was more difficult to obtain in some jurisdictions. The use of methamphetamine among IDU has stabilised or decreased in most jurisdictions in 2002. 3. Cocaine use decreased in frequency and prevalence among IDU in NSW, and in other jurisdictions it remained relatively uncommon and infrequent. There was an association in NSW between a reported increase in heroin use and decreased cocaine use. The median purity of domestic cocaine seizures analysed were lower than in 2000 / 01 while the median purity of AFP border seizures were higher. 4.

Numerous one-class classifiers are tried out, from the simple k-means to the more elaborate Support Vector Data Description algorithm. The target application is the classification of illicit drugs samples as part of an existing trafficking network or as a new cluster. A unique chemical database of <b>heroin</b> and cocaine <b>seizures</b> is available and allows assessing the methods. Evaluation is done using the area under the ROC curve of the classifiers. Gaussian mixture models and the SVDD method are trained both with and without outlier examples, and it is found that providing outliers during training improves in some cases the classification performance. Finally, combination schemes of classifiers are also tried out. Results highlight methods that may guide the profiling methodology used in forensic analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} a statistical overview of illicit drug arrests and seizures {{as well as}} profiling the current situation, national impact and the emerging trends and threats of illicit drugs in Australia. The report brings together illicit drug data {{from a variety of}} sources including law enforcement, health and academia. This is the only report of its type in Australia and {{provides a}}n important evidence base to assist decision-makers in developing strategies to combat the threat posed by illicit drugs. The Australian illicit drug market continued to be dominated by cannabis, which accounted for around 70 per cent of the number of seizures and arrests in 2010 – 11. Other prominent drug types for arrests and seizures during this period were amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) and ‘other and unknown’. Over 9. 3 tonnes of illicit drugs were seized nationally in 2010 – 11, representing a 19 per cent increase from the 7. 8 tonnes in 2009 – 10. The number of national illicit drug seizures also increased, from 63 670 in 2009 – 10 to 69 595 in 2010 – 11, and is the highest reported in the last decade. In 2010 – 11, there were 84 738 illicit drug related arrests, the second highest reported in the last decade. Drug types that have recorded the most substantial increase in arrests in the last decade are ATS and ‘other and unknown’, increasing by 62 per cent and 48 per cent respectively. Key findings from the Illicit Drug Data Report 2010 – 11 : • The number of ATS (excluding MDMA) detections at the Australian border increased by 60 per cent in 2010 – 11 and is the highest recorded in the last decade. • Cannabis remains the dominant illicit drug in Australia in terms of arrests, seizures and use. • Cannabis and steroids were the only illicit drug types to report an increase in arrests in 2010 – 11 and both reported the highest number of arrests in the last decade. • The weight of heroin detections at the Australian border increased by 241 per cent in 2010 – 11 and is the highest recorded since 2001 – 02. • Profiling of <b>heroin</b> <b>seizures</b> at the Australian border indicate that South-East Asia accounted for the greatest proportion of bulk weight analysed, increasing from 48. 2 per cent in 2009 to 93. 3 per cent in 2010. • The weight of national heroin and other opioids seizures increased by 428 per cent in 2010 – 11 and is the highest in the last decade. • The weight of national cocaine seizures increased by 67. 7 per cent in 2010 – 11 and is the third highest recorded in the last decade. • The number of national ‘other and unknown’ drug seizures is the highest recorded in the last decade. • National steroid seizures and arrests increased in 2010 – 11 and are now the highest recorded in the last decade. • In 2010 – 11, a record 703 clandestine laboratories were detected in Australia, with Queensland continuing to report the highest number of detections...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the potential {{that exists in}} technologically advanced systems to assist the local law enforcement authorities in Thailand {{in their attempts to}} continue to effectively control the drug trafficking, despite the advent of newly appeared "threats," like the spread of the amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS). It also provides the pre-Concept of Operations (CONOPS) of such a system, funded by the DoD/CNTPO (Department of Defense/Counter-Narcoterrorism Technology Program Office). Even with opium seizures significantly reduced in the country, accompanied by a similar decline in <b>heroin</b> and morphine <b>seizures,</b> there is no space for complacency, especially given the fact that one of the neighboring countries, Myanmar, is placed among the top two opium producers around the globe. Illicit drug trafficking is a phenomenon that cannot be addressed autonomously. Rather, evidence strongly relates illicit drug trafficking to terrorism activity, in a relation that is highly reciprocal. In the past decade this common front is described by the term "narcoterrorism," stressing the correlation of these two areas of illegal activity, which until recently were independent of one another. Clearly, the only response to the sophisticated narcoterrorism networks must be based on advanced technological tools. The Flexible Architecture System and Topology License Plate Recognition (FAST LPR) system is a promising solution to this problem. Hellenic Air Force author...|$|R
