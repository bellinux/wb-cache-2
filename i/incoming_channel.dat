In particular, we have calculated the scattering properties of homonuclear mixtures of 85 Rb, in a variety of <b>incoming</b> <b>channels,</b> and we have calculated the properties of heteronuclear mixtures of the isotopologues of Rb and Cs, and K and Cs. In general, we are interested in the location and character of Feshbach resonances in these mixtures with a view towards ultracold molecule formation. In 85 Rb there is a rich Feshbach structure and potential uses for the resonances that we ﬁnd, in the scattering lengths of the various <b>incoming</b> <b>channels,</b> are discussed. In 85 RbCs there is a rich Feshbach structure and the prospects for ultracold molecule formation using this system are detailed. Similarly, we detail the Feshbach resonances of 87 RbCs and discuss our results {{in the context of the}} successful formation of ultracold ground-state molecules. In the isotopologues of KCs each system has a rich Feshbach structure and we detail the location and width of the resonances, as well as the potential for ultracold molecule formation using each of the isotopes of potassium. In addition to scattering calculations, we have also calculated the location and character of the highest-lying bound states of each system. We have investigated the energy dependence of the scattering length using accurate coupled-channel calculations on 6 Li, 39 K and 133 Cs to explore the behaviour of the eﬀective range in the vicinity of both broad and narrow Feshbach resonances. We present an alternative parametrization of the eﬀective range and further demonstrate that an analytical form of an energy and magnetic ﬁeld-dependent phase shift, based on multichannel quantum defect theory, gives accurate results for the energy-dependent scattering length. Lastly, we examine the eﬀect of additional external ﬁelds on alkali-metal collisions and discuss how external ﬁelds can be used to manipulate the interaction properties of a system...|$|R
50|$|A more {{practical}} approach, and one {{adopted by the}} majority of WSS manufacturers is shown schematically in Figure 1 (to be uploaded). The various <b>incoming</b> <b>channels</b> of a common port are dispersed continuously onto a switching element which then directs and attenuates each of these channels independently to the N switch ports. The dispersive mechanism is generally based on holographic or ruled diffraction gratings similar to those used commonly in spectrometers. It can be advantageous, for achieving resolution and coupling efficiency, to employ a combination of a reflective or transmissive grating and a prism - known as a GRISM. The operation of the WSS can be bidirectional so the wavelengths can be multiplexed together from different ports onto a single common port. To date, the majority of deployments have used a fixed channel bandwidth of 50 or 100 GHz and 9 output ports are typically used.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} the amplified-and-forward relaying in a multichannel system with linear processing capability at the relay. We propose an analytical approach to study the linear processing performance with an aim to maximize the end-to-end achievable rate, assuming equal power amplification at the relay. For the class of permutation matrices as the special case of linear processing, the problem reduces to finding the optimal channel pairing scheme that maps <b>incoming</b> <b>channels</b> to outgoing channels at the relay. The proposed unified approach allows us to obtain the corresponding optimal permutation for channel pairing, for either relaying {{with or without the}} direct path available. Particular to the case when the direct path is available, such optimal pairing strategy has not been shown before. We further demonstrate that the so obtained optimal permutation is in fact also optimal among all unitary matrices for achievable rate maximization, thus, establishing the optimality of channel pairing approach among unitary linear processing schemes. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the achievable gain of optimal channel pairing compared with nonoptimal linear processing and non-pairing. I...|$|R

40|$|Network coding, a {{relatively}} new paradigm for transmitting information through communication networks, allowing intermediate nodes in the network to combine data received on separate <b>incoming</b> <b>channels</b> before transmitting on outgoing channels. When compared with traditional routing paradigms, network coding can result in benefits such as higher throughput, fault-tolerance, and security. In this paper, we focus on studying network coding properties on a specific class of graphs called grid graphs. Network coding properties are related to well-known Steiner properties in graphs. Specifically, Steiner properties of grid graphs are studied, because they model VLSI layout design, which makes network coding properties {{a natural extension of}} this investigation. In particular, we looked at the maximum size of a communication group that is possible in a grid graph, given a specific desired transmission rate. Letting rk (G) be the maximum fraction of nodes in graph G that can be included in a network coded multicast group with an integral flow of size k, we prove that r 2 (G) < 1, r 3 (G) < 1 2, and r 4 (G) < 1 3.

In burst segmentation dropping scheme, rather than dropping the entire burst during contention, the burst may be broken into multiple segments, and only the overlapping segments are dropped.

40|$|Traditional close-coupling methods suppose an {{expansion}} of the total wave function in terms of inner stationary states of colliding subsystems. In the case of hadronic atoms, a similar expansion has to involve, inter alia, low angular momentum states (ns, np) with large annihilation or nuclear absorbtion widths. The life times of these states are small as compared with the collision time and mean time between subsequent collisions, therefore the close-coupling approach has to be modified for the similar problems. In this paper we propose a generalization of the close-coupling method with annihilating states included in the basis. The correct asymptotic behaviour of the wave function in the annihilating channels suppose that the annihilating states can not be presented in the <b>incoming</b> <b>channels</b> whereas the corresponding components of the wave function of relative motion in outgoing channels have to damp out at large distances. The S-matrix of the transitions in the subspace of all other (non-annihilating) states is not unitary, because the hamiltonian of the problem is non-hermitian. The unitary defect gives the cross section of induced annihilation. The scheme of the numerical solving of the generalized close-coupling equations is proposed.
