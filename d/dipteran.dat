5|$|Diptera {{go through}} a {{complete}} metamorphosis with four distinct life stages – egg, larva, pupa and adult. In many flies, the larval stage is long and adults may have a short life. Most <b>dipteran</b> larvae develop in protected environments; many are aquatic and others are found in moist places such as carrion, fruit, vegetable matter, fungi and, {{in the case of}} parasitic species, inside their hosts. They tend to have thin cuticles and become desiccated if exposed to the air. Apart from the Brachycera, most <b>dipteran</b> larvae have sclerotinised head capsules, which may be reduced to remnant mouth hooks; the Brachycera, however, have soft, gelatinized head capsules from which the sclerites are reduced or missing. Many of these larvae retract their heads into their thorax.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the first pair of wings {{has evolved into a}} pair of hard wing covers, while in <b>Dipteran</b> flies the second pair of wings has evolved into small halteres used for balance.|$|E
5|$|Whereas many <b>dipteran</b> larvae are aquatic or live in {{enclosed}} terrestrial locations, {{the majority}} of adults live above ground and are capable of flight. Predominantly they feed on nectar or plant or animal exudates, such as honeydew, for which their lapping mouthparts are adapted. The flies that feed on vertebrate blood have sharp stylets that pierce the skin, the insects inserting anticoagulant saliva and absorbing the blood that flows; in this process, certain diseases can be transmitted. The bot flies (Oestridae) have evolved to parasitize mammals. Many species complete their life cycle inside the bodies of their hosts. In many <b>dipteran</b> groups, swarming is a feature of adult life, with clouds of insects gathering in certain locations; these insects are mostly males, and the swarm may serve the purpose of making their location more visible to females.|$|E
50|$|Harlequin flies {{are small}} <b>dipterans</b> which {{resemble}} mosquitoes.|$|R
50|$|Histiotus are aerial feeders and use {{echolocation}} {{to catch}} prey. They can create echolocation calls dominated by frequencies below 20 Hz {{in order to}} catch prey. Histiotus diet consists of insects, specifically H. montanus mainly eats butterflies and <b>Dipterans</b> (fly). H. macrotus eats <b>Dipterans</b> and H. velatus eat moths.|$|R
50|$|Diet is {{varied and}} {{includes}} mites, ants, coleopterans, <b>dipterans,</b> homopterans, and colembolas.|$|R
5|$|The brightly {{coloured}} pile of the bumblebee is an aposematic (warning) signal, {{given that}} females can inflict a painful sting. Depending on the species and morph, the warning colours range from entirely black, to bright yellow, red, orange, white, and pink. <b>Dipteran</b> {{flies in the}} families Syrphidae (hoverflies), Asilidae (robber flies), Tabanidae (horseflies), Oestridae (bot or warble flies) and Bombyliidae (bee flies) all include Batesian mimics of bumblebees, resembling them closely enough to deceive at least some predators.|$|E
5|$|Animals form another {{important}} part of the house sparrow's diet, chiefly insects, of which beetles, caterpillars, <b>dipteran</b> flies, and aphids are especially important. Various noninsect arthropods are eaten, as are molluscs and crustaceans where available, earthworms, and even vertebrates such as lizards and frogs. Young house sparrows are fed mostly on insects until about 15 days after hatching. They are also given small quantities of seeds, spiders, and grit. In most places, grasshoppers and crickets are the most abundant foods of nestlings. True bugs, ants, sawflies, and beetles are also important, but house sparrows take advantage of whatever foods are abundant to feed their young. House sparrows have been observed stealing prey from other birds, including American robins.|$|E
5|$|Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, {{has long}} {{been used as a}} model {{organism}} in research because of the ease with which it can be bred and reared in the laboratory, its small genome, and {{the fact that many of}} its genes have counterparts in higher eukaryotes. A large number of genetic studies have been undertaken based on this species; these have had a profound impact on the study of gene expression, gene regulatory mechanisms and mutation. Other studies have investigated physiology, microbial pathogenesis and development among other research topics. The studies on <b>dipteran</b> relationships by Willi Hennig helped in the development of cladistics, techniques that he applied to morphological characters but now adapted for use with molecular sequences in phylogenetics.|$|E
50|$|The fish is an omnivore. It consumes chironomids, mayflies, aquatic insects, <b>dipterans,</b> and plants.|$|R
5|$|Many <b>dipterans</b> serve {{roles that}} are useful to humans. Houseflies, blowflies and fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae) are {{scavengers}} and aid in decomposition. Robber flies (Asilidae), tachinids (Tachinidae) and dagger flies and balloon flies (Empididae) are predators and parasitoids of other insects, helping {{to control a}} variety of pests. Many <b>dipterans</b> such as bee flies (Bombyliidae) and hoverflies (Syrphidae) are pollinators of crop plants.|$|R
50|$|Sigmavirus is a genus {{of viruses}} {{in the family}} Rhabdoviridae, order Mononegavirales. Sigmaviruses {{naturally}} infect <b>dipterans.</b>|$|R
5|$|Loggerheads have {{numerous}} predators, especially {{early in}} their lives. Egg and nestling predators include ghost crabs, oligochaete worms, beetles, fly larvae, ants, parasitoid wasp larvae, flesh flies, snakes, gulls, corvids, opossums, bears, rats, armadillos, mustelids, skunks, canids, procyonids, cats, pigs, and humans. During their migration from their nests to the sea, hatchlings are preyed on by <b>dipteran</b> larvae, crabs, toads, lizards, snakes, seabirds such as frigatebirds, and other assorted birds and mammals. In the ocean, predators of the loggerhead juveniles include fish, such as parrotfish and moray eels, and portunid crabs. Adults are more rarely attacked due to their large size, but may be preyed on by large sharks, seals, and killer whales. Nesting females are attacked by flesh flies, feral dogs, and humans. Salt marsh mosquitos can also pester nesting females.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{are less}} likely to be {{attacked}} by parasites than bees, wasps and ants, as they are usually well protected in their mounds. Nevertheless, termites are infected by a variety of parasites. Some of these include <b>dipteran</b> flies, Pyemotes mites, and a large number of nematode parasites. Most nematode parasites are in the order Rhabditida; others are in the genus Mermis, Diplogaster aerivora and Harteria gallinarum. Under imminent threat of an attack by parasites, a colony may migrate to a new location. Fungi pathogens such as Aspergillus nomius and Metarhizium anisopliae are, however, major threats to a termite colony as they are not host-specific and may infect large portions of the colony; transmission usually occurs via direct physical contact. M.anispliae is known to weaken the termite immune system. Infection with A.nomius only occurs when a colony is under great stress.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{used for}} {{biological}} control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. Bacillus thuringiensis {{is the most}} widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and <b>Dipteran</b> (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in organic farming also.|$|E
40|$|From 1986 to 1992, I {{surveyed}} the invertebrate fauna of twelve limestone caves from South Ribeira Valley (State of Paraná, Brazil). Associated to {{walls in the}} entrace zone live Enoploctenus and Blechroscelis spiders, Goniosoma opilionids, Strinalia crickets, Latebraria amphipyroides moths, and Culicidae and Sciaridae <b>dipterans.</b> In aphotic zone, occur Plato spiders, Daguerreia inermis opilionids, Pseudonannolene strinatii diplopods, Smicridea caddisflies and the aquatic crustacean Aegla paulensis. I found in both zones Ctenus fasciatus spiders. Paronella collembolans, Zelurus travassosi heteropterans, Cholevidae and Anthribidae beetles, Phoridae <b>dipterans</b> and Braconidae wasps. One {{of the most important}} energy sources in these caves is the hematophagous bat guano. Associated to the guano piles there is a fauna composed by psedoscorpiones, acarians, Katantodesmus diplopods, Acherontides and Paronella collembolans, Dissochaetus beetles and Phoridae <b>dipterans.</b> The cave fauna studied is similar to that Ribeira Valley of the State of São Paulo. The most expressive difference is the absence of some taxa very common in São Paulo caves, such as the Oniscidae and Styloniscidae isopods, Cryptodesmidae and Chelodesmidae diplopods. Endecous crickets, Tricommatidae harvestmen, Calamoceratidae caddisflies and Neoditomyia Keroplatidae <b>dipterans...</b>|$|R
25|$|Insects such as <b>dipterans</b> {{are known}} parasitoids of mollusks. To {{complete}} their development, many <b>dipterans</b> use slugs as hosts during their ontogeny. Some species of blow-flies (Calliphoridae) in the genus Melinda are known parasitoids of Arionidae, Limacidae and Philomycidae. Flies {{in the family}} Phoridae, specially those in the genus Megaselia, are parasitoids of Agriolimacidae, including many species of Deroceras. House flies in the family Muscidae, mainly those in the genus Sarcophaga, are facultative parasitoids of Arionidae.|$|R

5|$|Diptera {{is one of}} {{the major}} insect orders and are of {{considerable}} ecological and human importance. Flies are important pollinators, second only to the bees and their Hymenopteran relatives. Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination. Fruit flies are used as model organisms in research, but less benignly, mosquitoes are vectors for malaria, dengue, West Nile fever, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other infectious diseases, and houseflies spread food-borne illnesses. Flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers, buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids. Larger flies such as tsetse flies and screwworms cause significant economic harm to cattle. Blowfly larvae, known as gentles, and other <b>dipteran</b> larvae, known more generally as maggots, are used as fishing bait and as food for carnivorous animals. They are also used in medicine in debridement to clean wounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{first true}} dipterans known {{are from the}} Middle Triassic (around 240 million years ago), and they became {{widespread}} during the Middle and Late Triassic. Modern flowering plants did not appear until the Cretaceous (around 140 million years ago), so the original dipterans {{must have had a}} different source of nutrition other than nectar. Based on the attraction of many modern fly groups to shiny droplets, {{it has been suggested that}} they may have fed on honeydew produced by sap-sucking bugs which were abundant at the time, and <b>dipteran</b> mouthparts are well-adapted to softening and lapping up the crusted residues. The basal clades in the Diptera include the Deuterophlebiidae and the enigmatic Nymphomyiidae. Three episodes of evolutionary radiation are thought to have occurred based on the fossil record. Many new species of lower Diptera developed in the Triassic, about 220 million years ago. Many lower Brachycera appeared in the Jurassic, some 180 million years ago. A third radiation took place among the Schizophora at the start of the Paleogene, 66 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} causes of myiasis in {{humans and animals}} are the three <b>dipteran</b> {{families}} Oestridea, Calliphoridae, and Sarcophagidae. Myiasis in humans is clinically categorized in six ways: dermal and subdermal, facial cavity, wound or traumatic, gastrointestinal, vaginal, and generalized. If found in humans, the <b>dipteran</b> larvae are usually in their first instar. The only treatment necessary is just to remove the maggots, and the patient heals naturally. Whilst not strictly a myiasis species, the Congo floor maggot feeds on mammal blood, occasionally human.|$|E
50|$|Interestingly the DNA and RNA {{sequences}} for olfaction receptors in C. stygia {{are more}} {{similar to those found}} in the Lepidopteran order than other <b>Dipterans.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like other <b>dipterans,</b> S. crassipalpis reproduces {{utilizing}} complete metamorphosis, i.e. {{the life}} cycle consists of the following stages: egg, larva (called a maggot), pupa, and adult.|$|R
50|$|Coarctate pupa - {{enclosed}} in a hardened cuticle of the penultimate larval instar called puparium. However, the pupa itself is of exarate adecticous pupa forms. (Cyclorrhapha of <b>Dipterans).</b>|$|R
25|$|Pests of tea include {{mosquito}} bugs of {{the genus}} Helopeltis (which are true bugs that must {{not be confused with}} the <b>dipteran)</b> that can tatter leaves, so they may be sprayed with insecticides. In addition, there may be Lepidopteran leaf feeders and various tea diseases.|$|E
25|$|Plasmodium is a genus of {{parasitic}} alveolates, many {{of which}} cause malaria in their hosts. The parasite always has two hosts in its life cycle: a <b>Dipteran</b> insect host and a vertebrate host. Sexual reproduction always occurs in the insect, making it the definitive host.|$|E
25|$|Antennae {{are usually}} long, with many similar and {{symmetric}} segments. These are small to very small flies, usually of delicate morphology with relatively long legs and wings. Body and wings are often covered in fine scales. Thorax is distinctly humped, abdomen is elongated. All species of veterinary and medical importance are blood feeders, with {{various types of}} mouthparts (these variations do not relate clearly to <b>dipteran</b> taxonomy).|$|E
50|$|Lizards in the Xenosaurus genus are {{exclusively}} {{found in}} crevices. Such a lifestyle {{suggests that the}} diets of these lizards might be opportunistic, and they eat whatever crawls or flies past or into their crevice. Their diet consists primarily of insects, but occasional lizard prey are taken. Their most frequent prey includes coleopterans (beetles), <b>dipterans</b> (flies), orthopterans (insects such as grasshoppers, crickets, weta, and locusts), and myriapods (terrestrial arthropods such as millipedes and centipedes). On the basis of number, they consume the most <b>dipterans,</b> but {{on the basis of}} volume, they consume the most orthopterans.|$|R
50|$|True {{flies and}} {{mosquitoes}} belongs to order Diptera is much highly recorded from Sri Lanka. There {{are more than}} 1,341 <b>dipterans</b> found in the island, which earns fourth largest insect order found.|$|R
50|$|In Canella winterana, {{the flowers}} are protogynous. The berries are usually red, and {{probably}} eaten by birds, which contribute to seed dispersal (ornithochory). The trees are attacked by larvae of different insects, including <b>dipterans.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Sciaridae occur worldwide, even {{in extreme}} {{habitats}} such as subantarctic islands and mountainous regions above 4,000 m. Others (such as Parapnyxia) {{are found in}} deserts, where they dig into the sand at extreme temperatures. Several species live exclusively in caves. However, most species live in forests, swamps, and moist meadows, where {{they live in the}} foliage. They are also often found in flowerpots. In moist and shadowy areas, up to 70% of all <b>dipteran</b> species can be Sciaridae.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} {{anatomy of}} tsetse is fairly {{typical of the}} insects. The crop {{is large enough to}} accommodate a huge increase in size during the bloodmeal since tsetse can take a bloodmeal equal in weight to themselves. The reproductive tract of adult females includes a uterus which can become large enough to hold the third-instar larva {{at the end of each}} pregnancy. The article Parasitic flies of domestic animals has a diagram of anatomy of <b>dipteran</b> flies.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} and {{development}} of Phormia regina {{is similar to that}} of most other <b>dipteran</b> species, in which females oviposit their eggs into a nutrient substrate and after hatching the larvae continue feeding throughout three instar stages until they have stored up enough calories to commence pupation and finally emerge as adult blow flies. Each transition from first, second, and third instar is marked by a molt, and eventually the third-instar larvae develop sclerotized (hardened) casings which envelop and protect them throughout metamorphosis.|$|E
50|$|Exarate pupa - {{appendages}} {{are free}} and are not usually encapsulated within a cocoon. All decticous pupa and some adecticous pupa are always exarate. (Neuroptera, Trichoptera, Cyclorrhapha of <b>Dipterans,</b> Siphonaptera, most Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and few Lepidoptera).|$|R
50|$|The diet of Argentinean Dendropsophus nanus {{was found}} to consist mostly of <b>dipterans</b> and spiders. During the cold time of the year, these frogs partly rely on their fat reserves, more so than {{sympatric}} Hypsiboas pulchellus.|$|R
5000|$|The diet of the {{freshwater}} drum is generally benthic and composed of macroinvertebrates (mainly aquatic insect larvae and bivalve mussels), {{as well as}} small fish in certain ecosystems. [...] Freshwater drum show distinct seasonal differences in their diet. In April and May, the drum feeds on <b>dipterans.</b> During these months, <b>dipterans</b> make up about 50 percent of the {{freshwater drum}}'s diet. [...] In August through November, they tend to eat fish (which are primarily young-of-the-year gizzard shad). The percentage of fish in their diet at this time ranges from 52-94 percent. Other items in the drum's diet are mollusks and crayfish. Freshwater drum tend {{to hang out with}} walleye.|$|R
