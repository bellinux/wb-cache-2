40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to {{ascertain}} the optimum working conditions of a pile oscillator and to compare this method with the <b>danger</b> <b>coefficient</b> technique {{from the point of}} view of minimum amount of resonance absorption which can be detected. The space-time behavior of the absorption properties of the sample is described by means of a delta -function and the reactor kinetic equations are obtained by using a single mode expansion of the flux. The results are applied to a bare reactor model equivalent to the fully reflected, parallelepiped BSR-I. (W. D. M. ...|$|E
40|$|Early in 1942 it {{had been}} found on a {{laboratory}} scale that certain impurities such as the Rare Earths were removed by small water washes from an ether solution of Uranyl Nitrate. It was hoped that in the large production units to be constructed that the water soluble impurities would all be washed out {{by the time the}} radioactive Thorium had been removed, so that the decrease in radioactivity could be used as an index of the amount of all kinds of impurity remaining in the ether layer. Experience has taught both the production and the laboratory chemist to view with suspicion a process which claims to separate one element from all others in the periodic system with a simple set of manipulations such as an extraction. Furthermore, there is the familiar example of iodide ion which anyone would expect to be oxidized to iodine and then be transferred almost quantitatively to the ether layer from which it would not wash out. It seemed reasonable that other elements or ions would be found which would fail to wash out of the ether layer. Since the objective was the removal of the neutron absorbers whether their <b>danger</b> <b>coefficients</b> were especially high or not, it became important that every possible check on the effectiveness of the extraction method was investigated. Furthemore there was a probability that the concentration of any individual impurity in different batches of raw material would vary over a wide range. The question was raised whether a large increase in the concentration of some ions would either make the washing of the ether layer unsuccessful or uneconomical...|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{proliferation}} of mobile devices, explosive mobile applications (apps) are {{developed in the}} past few years. However, the functions of mobile apps are varied and the designs of them are not well understood by end users, especially the activities and functions related to user privacy. Therefore, understanding how much danger of mobile apps with respect to privacy violation to mobile users is becomes a critical issue when people use mobile devices. In this paper, we evaluate the mobile app privacy violation of mobile users by computing the <b>danger</b> <b>coefficient.</b> In order to help people reduce the privacy leakage, we combine both the user preference to mobile apps and the privacy risk of apps and propose a mobile app usage recommendation method named AppURank to recommend the secure apps with the same function as the “dangerous” one for people use. The evaluation results show that our recommendation can reduce the privacy leakage by 50 %...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFatigue phenomena, {{which appear}} {{generally}} below the yield stress, {{is the cause}} of more than 80 % of in-service mechanical failures. However, the optimization of the weight and cost when designing mechanical components or structures, linked to improved performance, leads to increasingly stressed components. Therefore a fatigue design approach must be done by the engineer. This paper shows the experience gained over five academic years of teaching fatigue the assessment of automotive components using a reliability approach to predict probability of failure, in the engineering school, Arts et Métiers ParisTech, in France. The choice was made to present a comprehensive fatigue assessment approach using a method, initially developed in the automotive industry and since extended to the aeronautical and mechanical industries. This method is known as the "Stress-Strength interference analysis". The "Stress" represents the distribution of the driver severity, and the "Strength" represents the distribution of the fatigue strength of all the components. A suspension arm is used to illustrate the approach. The Dang Van multiaxial fatigue criterion is implemented in a Finite Elements Code and a <b>danger</b> <b>coefficient</b> is visualized on the meshed structure. The fatigue analysis is interpreted with respect to the target reliability sought by the car- manufacturer...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} solving the problem of aircraft flight safety. External threats {{in the form of}} aircraft-offenders are considered. The algorithm of collision danger coefficients with aircraft-offenders is presented, оn the basis of which the side-program manager of flight safety monitoring is formed. Two danger coefficients in the horizontal and vertical planes are introduced. Based on various flight situations four possible decisions are offered: absence of any aircraft activity, flight level change, deviation in the horizontal plane and both in vertical and horizontal planes. For each case the formulas of double evaluation are received. They take into account different parameters of aircraft relative motion. Based on these estimates it is possible to build a final expert evaluation for the considered flight situations. It is implemented in the onboard program-manager. The structure of the program is presented. At the program-manager output the expected minimized risk evaluation and the selected alternative of the avoidance of aircraft from the meeting point are formed. The paper presents {{a detailed description of the}} procedures to test the performance of the program-manager algorithms. The initial conditions for different flight situations are provided. The simulation results of the algorithm are given. The danger coefficients comparison when performing maneuvers to prevent dangerous approach and in their absence is illustrated. It is shown that the maneuver implementation recommended by program-manager algorithms decreases the resulting <b>danger</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Particular attention was paid to aircraft landing, especially if the landing area had several conflicting aircraft. </p...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays each forth person {{suffers from}} {{allergic}} diseases and allergic pathology prevalence is constantly growing. There are compounds in air which are generally toxic, or have sensitizing or allergenic effects on a body. For example, we can name formaldehyde and nitrogen dioxide. Our research {{goal was to}} reveal a correlation between reaction of leucocytes migration inhibition to formaldehyde and level of inhalation exposure to the examined chemicals. We examined 410 teenag-ers who permanently lived in industrial cities in Irkutsk region. We studied individual load as per formaldehyde and nitrogen dioxide. We estimated eosinophils content in nasal mucus and determined indexes of leucocytes migration inhibition to for-maldehyde. Index of formaldehyde effects danger was detected to exceed 1 in 54 % teenagers. The greatest value of <b>danger</b> <b>coefficient</b> in terms of exposure to this substance was equal to 1. 76. anger index in terms of exposure to nitrogen dioxide didn't exceed 0. 7 in the examined teenagers. The obtained results prove that inhalation formaldehyde load influences teenag-ers from industrial centers as sensitization to this substance evolves in them. We found out that true inhibition reaction of leucocytes migration in a reaction with formaldehyde more frequently occurred in people with danger index in terms of ex-posure to this substance being lower than 1. We obtained models which described correlation between level of sensitization to formaldehyde {{and a number of}} eosinophils in nasal mucus and it allowed us to detect that sensitization depended on the examined contaminants content in the air. The sensitization to chemical air contaminants which we revealed in teenagers calls for necessary activities aimed at reducing risks of allergenic pathology evolvement in them...|$|E
40|$|The {{number and}} size of Gd/sub 2 /O/sub 3 / poison {{cylinders}} were computed for a large boiling water reactor with H/sub 2 /O-toUO/sub 2 / ratio of 2. 6, a U/ sup 235 / enrichment of 3. 3 wt%, and Zr clad. The excess reactivity of the poisoned core was computed for the cold-clean, hot-clean non-voided, and hot full- power condition {{as a function of}} Mwd/t. For comparison, these calculations were repeated for B/sub 4 /C as the burnable poison element for the same reactor. The use of Gd rather than B/sup 10 / as the burnable poison reduces the moderator and void defect and provides a better match to the poison demand curve. For reactors in the lifetime range of 10, 000 Mwd/t, the use of Gd results in a smaller poison residual. However, for lifetimes of approximately 20, 000 Mwd/t, B/sup 10 / and Gd are comparable. Methods were developed to account for the netron interaction among clusters of Gd/sub 2 /O/sub 3 / poison cylinders. Gadolinia cylinders in Al/ sub 2 /O/sub 3 / rods were formed and sintered to 3100 deg F. A reaction between Gd/ sub 2 /O/sub 3 / and Al/sub 2 /O/sub 3 / begins at 2650 deg F. At 3000 deg F the reaction is complete with the integrity of the cylinders destroyed. The compound GdAlO/sub 3 / is formed. Gadolinia cylinders in UO/sub 2 / rods were formed and sintered to 3100 deg F. A reaction between Gd 2 O/sub 3 / and UO/sub 2 / begins at 2850 deg F. At 3100 deg F the reaction is complete with the Gd 2 O/sub 3 / diffused out of its original site and dispersed throughout the UO/sub 2 / matrix. Investigations were begun of the reaction between UO/sub 2 / and Gd 2 O/sub 3 / mixed with other oxides such as Al 2 O/sub 3 / {{in the form of the}} compound GdAlO/sub 3 /. Twenty capsules were loaded with homogeneous mixtures of Al/sub 2 /O/sub 3 /, B 2 O/ sub 3 /, and Gd/sub 2 /O/sub 3 /. Initial <b>danger</b> <b>coefficient</b> measurements were performed on the samples in the University of Wisconsin Reactor. (auth...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was performed at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in 1958 to determine critical masses of cylinders of Oralloy (Oy) reflected {{by a number of}} materials. The experiments were all performed on the Comet Universal Critical Assembly Machine, and consisted of discs of highly enriched uranium (93. 3 wt. % 235 U) reflected by half-inch and one-inch-thick cylindrical shells of various reflector materials. The experiments were performed by members of Group N- 2, particularly K. W. Gallup, G. E. Hansen, H. C. Paxton, and R. H. White. This experiment was intended to ascertain critical masses for criticality safety purposes, as well as to compare neutron transport cross sections to those obtained from <b>danger</b> <b>coefficient</b> measurements with the Topsy Oralloy-Tuballoy reflected and Godiva unreflected critical assemblies. The reflector materials examined in this {{series of experiments}} are as follows: magnesium, titanium, aluminum, graphite, mild steel, nickel, copper, cobalt, molybdenum, natural uranium, tungsten, beryllium, aluminum oxide, molybdenum carbide, and polythene (polyethylene). Also included are two special configurations of composite beryllium and iron reflectors. Analyses were performed in which uncertainty associated with six different parameters was evaluated; namely, extrapolation to the uranium critical mass, uranium density, 235 U enrichment, reflector density, reflector thickness, and reflector impurities. In addition to the idealizations made by the experimenters (removal of the platen and diaphragm), two simplifications were also made to the benchmark models that resulted in a small bias and additional uncertainty. First of all, since impurities in core and reflector materials are only estimated, they are not included in the benchmark models. Secondly, the room, support structure, and other possible surrounding equipment {{were not included in the}} model. Bias values that result from these two simplifications were determined and associated uncertainty in the bias values were included in the overall uncertainty in benchmark keff values. Bias values were very small, ranging from 0. 0004 ?k low to 0. 0007 ?k low. Overall uncertainties range from ? 0. 0018 to ? 0. 0030. Major contributors to the overall uncertainty include uncertainty in the extrapolation to the uranium critical mass and the uranium density. Results are summarized in Figure 1. Figure 1. Experimental, Benchmark-Model, and MCNP/KENO Calculated Results The 32 configurations described and evaluated under ICSBEP Identifier HEU-MET-FAST- 084 are judged to be acceptable for use as criticality safety benchmark experiments and should be valuable integral benchmarks for nuclear data testing of the various reflector materials.
