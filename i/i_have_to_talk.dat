500|$|In an {{interview}} for Complex, Beyoncé expressed dissatisfaction with contemporary radio. She intended 4 to help change that status, commenting, [...] "Figuring {{out a way to}} get R back on the radio is challenging... With 4, I tried to mix R from the '70s and the '90s with rock 'n' roll and a lot of horns to create something new and exciting. I wanted musical changes, bridges, vibrata, live instrumentation and classic songwriting." [...] On her website she wrote, [...] "The album is definitely an evolution.

"Why, I {{was obliged}} to let him {{understand}} explicitly that I preferred to keep some of my clothes for my own personal wearing; also, I put his magnificence upon an allowance of cologne-water, and actually was so cruel as to restrict him to one dozen of my cambric handkerchiefs.
