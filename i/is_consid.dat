This hypothesis claims that amnesics suffer from a selective inability to remember background context i. e. spatiotemporal or extrinsic context. The evidence cited in support of this hypothesis is then critically reviewed and assessed in relation to two methodological problems.

The second problem is that contextual memory deficits, found in amnesics, may be incidental consequences of frontal cortex damage rather than essential to the core memory deficit. In the light of these problems it is concluded that currently there is no convincing support for the contextual memory deficit hypothesis of amnesia. Finally, guidelines are laid down which should enable the hypothesis to be more appropriately assessed, and an alternative kind of hypothesis is briefly outlined...|$|E

40|$|Hypotheses {{generated}} from animal studies that the endogenous opioid system {{is an important}} modulator of food intake suggest that blockade of the system in humans should affect eating behavior. To assess this hypothesis, seven normal volunteers were given 2 mg/kg naloxone or placebo on separate days in a double-blind, random but balanced cross-over experimental design. Compared to placebo, naloxone was found to reduce significantly total food intake from preselected prepared trays served 2. 75 and 7. 75 hours after drug administration (p < 0. 02). The reduction was considerable (28 %), and although the magnitude varied greatly among individ-uals, reduction occurred in each. This reduced food intake was not accompanied by a demon-strable alteration of the volunteers ' perceptions of their hunger. Further cautious experimental investigation of naloxone's effects during long-term administration and in patients with eating disorders is warranted in light of its apparent effect of reducing food intake in humans while not decreasing their satiety. There is substantial evidence from an-imal studies that the endogenous opioid system (EOS) is an important modulator of eating behavior (1, 2). An important component of this evidence is the dose-related suppression of food intake pro-duced by the administration of naloxone in the mg/kg range to rodents (3, 4).

In this study, the evaluating method of the local burning velocity was investigated using DNS data of turbulent premixed flames with different Lewis numbers. The local burning velocity was evaluated by integrating the chemical reaction rates along normal to the flame surface within three kinds of integration ranges that were defined as follows: the range which is defined by the half length of normal to the flame surface between its certain point and the other point crossing the flame surface (Range 1); the range which is defined by the reaction progress variable that the chemical reaction rate along normal to a planer flame surface takes a half of the maximum value (Range 2); the range which is defined by the length of normal to the flame surface between its certain point and the point which has the extreme value of the reaction progress variable (Range 3). As a result, Range 1 and Range 2 were affected by the flame shapes greatly, since the quantities of the integration ranges fluctu-ated widely dependent on the variations of turbulent premixed flames.

A total of 24 patients with prostate calcifications detectable using a kilo-voltage X-ray image-guidance system (ExacTrac X-ray system) were examined. Daily displacements of the calcification within the prostate relative to pelvic bony structures were calculated by the ExacTrac X-ray system. The average displacement and standard deviation (SD) in each of the left–right (LR), anterior–posterior (AP), and superior–inferior (SI) directions were calculated for each patient. Based on the results of interfrac-tional prostate motion, we also calculated planning target volume (PTV) margins using the van Herk formula and examined the validity of the PTV margin of our institute (a 9 -mm margin everywhere except posteriorly, where a 6 -mm margin was applied).

40|$|Compared with beta emitters, {{radionuclides}} that decay by {{electron capture}} or solely by isomerie transition are generally considered preferable for nuclear medicine {{because they do}} not release paniculate radiations from the nucleus during decay, and hence presumably con tribute less absorbed dose and biological damage to surrounding tissue. In this regard, the recent article by Rao, Govelitz, and Sastry (/) is of considerable interest because it reveals similar radiotoxicities for the elec tron-capture radionuclide Tl- 201 and the beta-emitting radionuclide Tl- 204, in spite of the 6 : 1 ratio of absorbed dose from Tl- 204 compared with Tl- 201 as computed by conventional dosimetrie methods. This observation implies that the radiobiological effectiveness <b>is</b> <b>consid</b> erably greater for radiations from Tl- 201 than for those from Tl- 204. As the authors point out, the radiations responsible for the local absorbed dose from Tl- 201 are principally low-energy electrons resulting from nonradiative Auger and Costcr-Kronig transitions. From questions asked by a number of individuals, it appears that these transitions are not familiar to all readers of the Journal. Hence, an explanation in relatively nontechnical terms may be useful. The Tl- 201 nucleus decays by electron capture, in which an electron, usually one occupying an inner shell, is captured by the nucleus. This process leaves a vacancy in the electron shell. The capture process reduces the atomic number of the nucleus by one to form Hg- 201 in an excited energy state. Decay to the ground state of Hg- 201 occurs by isomerie transition, in which energy is released, cither as 7 (radiative transitions) or through the process of internal conversion (nonradiative transi tions). In internal conversion, the released energy is carried from the atom by an electron ejected from a...|$|E
