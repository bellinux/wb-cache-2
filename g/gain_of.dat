The study drew on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Maryland statistical reports. The gain is attributable to savings in expenditures on means-tested public benefit programs and an increase in sales and lodging tax revenue from weddings and wedding-related tourism.|$|E

Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller {{finished}} the game having completed 18 of his 34 pass attempts for 266 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. He also ran three times for a total <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> one yard. Texas quarterback James Brown completed 14 of his 36 pass attempts for 148 yards, three interceptions, and a touchdown. He rushed six times for -43 yards because sacks are counted as runs for negative yardage. Texas also was hurt by penalty yardage. The Longhorns' nine penalties for 91 yards are both Texas bowl-game records.|$|E

It discusses various aspects of Yoga, ranging from recommending that healthy food should be eaten in temperate quantities, in small portions, several times a day, to recommending that Yoga should not be performed when one is not feeling well or is very hungry.

It lies in the South East Dorset conurbation {{which is one of the}} South Coast's major urban areas with a total population of over 400,000. Over the three decades between 1971 and 2001, Christchurch's population increased by 32% from 33,768 to 44,865; and between 1991 and 2001 by 8.5%. This was more than three times the average for England and Wales (2.5%), and it is expected to grow by a further 16% to 52,100 by 2028. Between 1999 and 2006 there was a net <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> 4,200 people from migration alone (i.e. excluding births and deaths). On average 3,100 people enter the borough and 2,500 leave each year, giving a net average <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> 600 migrants.

40|$|It is {{generally}} recognized that intact bovine males gain weight faster and require less feed per unit <b>of</b> <b>gain</b> than castrate bovine males. Further, carcasses from intact bovine males {{have a higher}} percentage of retail or edible product, but meat from intact males {{is generally}} evaluated slightly lower on palatability characteristics, particularly tenderness, than carcasses from castrate bovine males. It has been suggested that much of the advantage of intact vs castrate for rate <b>of</b> <b>gain,</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>gain,</b> and composition <b>of</b> <b>gain</b> may be expressed by an age of about 1 year and the disadvantages, including aggressive male behavior, that result in reduced rate and efficiency <b>of</b> <b>gain,</b> begin at about 1 year of age (at or immediately after puberty). Thus, there was need {{to determine the effects of}} castration at about 1 year on rate <b>of</b> <b>gain,</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>gain,</b> composition <b>of</b> <b>gain,</b> meat characteristics, and behavioral characteristics. Reports have shown that, when the anabolic agent zeranol [6 -(6, 10 -dyhydroxyundecyl) -B-resorcyclic acid-d-lactone] is implanted in intact male calves at or before weaning, rate <b>of</b> <b>gain</b> is increased and rate of testicular growth is decreased.

Harrison's allies in Washington argued on his behalf and aided in securing his reappointment.|$|E

5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion {{that women are more}} likely to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also the notion that the net household <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E

5|$|Adaptation {{may cause}} either the <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> a new feature, or {{the loss of}} an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is {{bacterial}} adaptation to antibiotic selection, with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying {{the target of the}} drug, or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell. Other striking examples are the bacteria Escherichia coli evolving the ability to use citric acid as a nutrient in a long-term laboratory experiment, Flavobacterium evolving a novel enzyme that allows these bacteria to grow on the by-products of nylon manufacturing, and the soil bacterium Sphingobium evolving an entirely new metabolic pathway that degrades the synthetic pesticide pentachlorophenol. An interesting but still controversial idea is that some adaptations might increase the ability of organisms to generate genetic diversity and adapt by natural selection (increasing organisms' evolvability).|$|E
