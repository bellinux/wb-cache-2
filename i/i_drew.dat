5|$|Neither can the oblique {{trend of}} the drapery, belt-high in the {{silhouette}} (in profile) of the elder, be explained … without accepting that she was seated, her left forearm resting on her thigh. Only thus could the dice be handled. Only thus, moreover, can so extreme a slope in the pleats coming away from the shoulder, pleats {{that would have to}} fall vertically in a non-seated figure, become understandable. On the right, let it not be readily forgotten that all the pleats turn strongly forward, so that they pass the centerline of the stele, marked by the high, triumphant flower and the mingled group of hands. For the maiden on the left, although the cascade of pleats is generally much more direct—as appropriate to a standing posture—some of them, curiously arched, turn forward as well, for example at the left armhole. They can scarcely be understood without again invoking the supporting effect produced by the leg of the seated woman. The folds of Kore’s sleeve, which in 1939 <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> a little too short in the descent, carry on to Demeter’s lap, where they spread out.|$|E
25|$|When I {{returned}} to IP in 1962 {{as president and}} editor-in-chief the house faced bankruptcy. Its publishing program had practically ceased, its debt to the publishers' services was so great without any prospect of payment in sight that the printers refused to undertake new work and the binders refused to release our books in stock. Fortunately, Trachty had some reserve funds that <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> upon immediately. I also arranged small loans {{from a number of}} our devoted readers. I also sent out an unprecedented appeal for donations to keep the publishing house going. We were thus able to meet the payroll and office expenses, and also to pay off enough of our debt to resume publishing.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read {{a good deal of}} it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E

25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
500|$|The song {{continues}} with another verse and subsequent chorus, when the bass finally enters. After the next verse an E major seven chord again marks a break {{before the start}} of the chorus. The second chorus transitions into a different verse, where Smith begins to play the drums, and Kiedis sings [...] "Take me all the way/Yeah/Yeah-e-yeah/Oh no, no." [...] After Kiedis cues [...] "One time," [...] a choir, whose presence was added to make the ending sound more epic, sings [...] "Under the bridge downtown," [...] in which Kiedis sings [...] "Is where <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> some blood/I could not get enough/Forgot about my love/I gave my life away" [...] in between. As the choir, Kiedis and drums stop, Frusciante and Flea play the outro until the song ends.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} speculated that Windsor based Peggy on Violet Kray, mother of the infamous East End gangsters, the Kray twins; however Windsor has denied this. Instead, she claims that Peggy is based on women she has seen in East End pubs and her own mother: [...] "women whose hair is great and their outfits are more Walthamstow market, they get it wrong slightly...Some things I've done with Peggy is from my Mum. She {{was one of those}} East End snobs. <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> on all of those experiences." [...] In a 2009 radio {{interview}} with Dale Winton, Windsor said three people have influenced her portrayal of Peggy: Violet Kray (thus retracting her earlier statement), her own mother, and the actor Mike Reid, who played her on-screen husband Frank Butcher.|$|E

500|$|Korn's bassist Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu came up {{with the}} title Life Is Peachy. The name came from Fieldy's Pee Chee folder. Fieldy often put [...] "Life Is" [...] in front of the brand name, which would humor him. Fieldy said, [...] "I used to doodle all over it [...] <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> long hair on the {{character}} and put guitars in their hands. I used to sketch stuff all the time. I eventually knew my scribbles might someday pay off. I thought that visual would make a really cool album cover." [...] Korn contacted the Pee Chee file folder company and asked for permission to use the file folder's image for an album cover, offering twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), resulting in the company turning the offer down. The name Life Is Peachy was agreed by band members to be a [...] "great" [...] name for the album, and kept the name but didn't add Fieldy's file folder cover.|$|E
500|$|Uzumaki was {{influenced}} by the positive representation of spirals in media, which inspired Ito to subvert them to create horror, stating: [...] "Usually spiral patterns mark character's cheeks in Japanese comedy cartoons, representing an effect of warmth. However, I thought it could be used in horror if <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> it a different way." [...] The story in which Kirie's hair is cursed by the spiral reflects a recurring theme in Ito's work in which a heroine's hair has a life of its own. Ito uses this imagery because it lends itself well to horror due to its association with the Japanese feminine ideal (Yamato nadeshiko), as well as the unnerving flowing motions of long hair, which he describes as snakelike. Ito also noted that horror writer H. P. Lovecraft was one of his inspirations when creating Uzumaki, stating that the gradual development of the spiral curse was patterned on Lovecraft's storytelling and that [...] " [...] expressionism with regard to atmosphere greatly inspires my creative impulse." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Under the Bridge" [...] was {{slightly}} altered because it contained personal lyrics by Anthony Kiedis, and the All Saints covered {{it because they}} liked the overall sound and feeling of the recording. The All Saints version contains samples of the original recording, {{the most important one}} being the distinctive guitar playing in the beginning. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were, however, displeased with this version; Kiedis felt the cover was poorly recreated and, with the omission of the final verse, which contains the line [...] "Under the bridge downtown / is where <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> some blood," [...] it lost all personal significance. He said of All Saints' version: [...] "It was kind of funny, they looked so pretty and clean, it looked like they didn't know what they were singing about." [...] The guitar on [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] was played by Richard Hawley. The original Japanese edition of the album version features a different, more R/pop version of the song.|$|E

500|$|By the 1890s, {{the dogs}} had {{attracted}} the attention of the Cattle Dog Club of Sydney, a group of men with a recreational interest in the new practice of showing dogs competitively. None were stockmen working cattle on a daily basis, and initially they were interested in a range of working dogs, including the Smithfield. They reportedly adopted the term [...] "Australian Cattle Dog" [...] to refer to the dogs being bred from bloodlines originating from Thomas Hall's [...] "heelers", and prominent members of the group concentrated on breeding these lines. Of these breeders, the Bagust family was the most influential. Robert Kaleski, of Moorebank, a young associate of Harry Bagust, wrote [...] "in 1893 when I got rid of my cross-bred cattle dogs and took up the blues, breeders of the latter had started breeding... to fix the type. <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> up a standard for them on those lines". This first breed standard for the Cattle Dog breed was published, with photographs, by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in 1903.|$|E
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1918, as World War <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> to a close, Cluj became a centre of revolutionary activity, headed by Amos Frâncu. [...] On 28 October 1918, Frâncu made an appeal for the {{organisation}} of the [...] "union of all Romanians". Thirty-nine delegates were elected from Cluj to attend the proclamation of the union of Transylvania with the Kingdom of Romania in Alba-Iulia on 1 December 1918, later acknowledged internationally by the Treaty of Trianon. The interwar years saw the new authorities embark on a [...] "Romanianisation" [...] campaign: a Capitoline Wolf statue donated by Rome {{was set up in}} 1921; in 1932 a plaque written by historian Nicolae Iorga was placed on Matthias Corvinus's statue, emphasising his Romanian paternal ancestry; and construction of an imposing Orthodox cathedral began, in a city where only about a tenth of the inhabitants belonged to the Orthodox state church. This endeavour had only mixed results: by 1939, Hungarians still dominated local economic (and to a certain extent) cultural life: for instance, Cluj had five Hungarian daily newspapers and just one in Romanian.|$|E
500|$|However, {{near the}} end of development, time {{constraints}} led the Pickford brothers to sell Zippo Games to Rare, in which Zippo was renamed Rare Manchester. With Rare as their boss, morale dropped for the development staff, and eventually everyone left the company before the game could be completed, thus shutting Rare Manchester down. According to Ste Pickford: [...] "One of the programmers completed the game himself after the studio closed." [...] Pickford included a cover, which consisted of a knight in a light-blue armor, in which he said [...] "was just something <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> for fun". However, when {{the final version of the}} game was sent to Rare for approval after the studio's closing, they threw away the cover and added their own. According to Pickford, [...] "The document came back with about two typos fixed, a new cover, and 'revised by Tim Stamper' in big letters on the title page, with all trace of myself or any of the Zippo Games names removed, so I guess Tim had a major role." [...] The game was published by Acclaim Entertainment and released in North America in March1992 and in Europe on January21, 1993.|$|E

500|$|Ozy and Millie {{originally}} {{started as}} a print comic strip in a Washington college newspaper, the Copper Point Journal, in 1997 using ink and brush as drawing implements. Simpson claims to {{have been influenced by}} comics and cartoons such as Bloom County, Calvin and Hobbes, The Simpsons and Pogo. It became an irregular webcomic in early 1998. In June 1998, it became a Monday-Friday daily strip. In the same year, Simpson won a newspaper syndicates' college cartoonist award. When the strip began, Simpson's artistic style was similar to that in Calvin and Hobbes. In 2000, the strip went on hiatus and returned with a new, unique style. The strip also went on hiatus several times. It was once on hiatus for five months, between August 23, 2003 to January 22, 2004. Between January 30, 2004, and January 12, 2009 Simpson also ran another strip, <b>I</b> <b>Drew</b> This, a webcomic specifically about her political views, which also appear in Ozy and Millie. In 2002, the strip won the Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards for [...] "Best Anthropomorphic Comic".

500|$|In mid-to-late 1918, as World War <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> to a close, the Austro-Hungarian Empire {{began to}} break apart, and local {{committees}} began assuming responsibility for administration from the central government. In October 1918, the self-proclaimed National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs was established in Zagreb, and later that month there were discussions between the Austro-Hungarian Navy {{and representatives of the}} National Council regarding the future of the Austro-Hungarian fleet. There was even an exchange of delegates between the National Council and the Austro-Hungarian naval staff in Vienna. By the end of that month, the [...] "sailor's councils" [...] that had been formed aboard Austro-Hungarian warships at the main base of Pola had decided that they would leave their ships by 1 November, regardless of the political discussions that were ongoing. On 30 October, the Austro-Hungarian naval staff directed its commanders to hand over all naval and riverine vessels to representatives of the National Council. The following day, the Emperor Charles ordered the handover of all naval vessels, establishments and fortresses to the National Council. By 4:30pm that day, the orders had been carried out. The National Council appointed Rear Admiral Dragutin Prica as the Navy Commissioner and Captain Janko Vuković de Podkapelski as fleet commander.|$|E
500|$|Much of Hill's lyrics {{dealt with}} motherhood, the Fugees, reminiscence, love, heartbreak, and God. Commenting on the album's gospel content, Hill stated [...] "Gospel music is music {{inspired}} by the gospels. In a huge respect, {{a lot of this}} music turned out to be just that. During this album, I turned to the Bible and wrote songs that <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> comfort from." [...] Several of the album's songs, such as [...] "Lost Ones," [...] "Superstar," [...] "Ex-Factor" [...] and [...] "Forgive Them Father" [...] were widely speculated as direct attacks at Fugee members Wyclef and Pras. [...] "Ex-Factor" [...] was originally intended for a different artist, however, Hill decided to keep it after it was completed, due to its personal content. Although {{a large portion of the}} album's love songs would turn out to be bitter from Hill's previous relationship, [...] "Nothing Even Matters," [...] a duet performed by Hill and R singer D'Angelo, showcased a brighter, more intimate perspective on the subject. The song was inspired by Hill's relationship with Rohan Marley. Speaking about [...] "Nothing Even Matters"' lyrics, Hill remarked: [...] "I wanted to make a love song, á la Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway, and give people a humanistic approach to love again without all the physicality and overt sexuality." ...|$|E
