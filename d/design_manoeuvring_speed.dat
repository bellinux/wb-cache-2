50|$|The aim of {{training}} on manned models is to enable seamen to acquire or to develop manoeuvring skills through {{a better understanding}} of a ship’s behaviour as it sails in restricted water conditions at <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>speed.</b> Manned models are considered by ships' captains and maritime pilots as {{the next best thing to}} a full-scale prototype for understanding a ship's behaviour. Training on the scale models provides experience that could never be gained on real ships for the simple reason that neither ship-owners nor local authorities would allow such risks to be taken. Scale models allow the shiphandler to make mistakes. Scale models allow experimentation on ship behaviour to explore unknown fields beyond the limits of safety.|$|R

40|$|Stefan Drzewiecki, {{submarine}} inventor for the Russian and French navies (1877 - 1900) This article concerns Stefan Drzewieckis naval engineering researches. This {{civil engineer}} {{was born into}} a rich polish Europeanized family and graduated at the Ecole centrale des arts et manufactures in Paris. Inventor in 1877 of a submarine prototype named Podascaphe, Drzewiecki pursued the improvement of his concept in terms of propulsion, <b>manoeuvring,</b> <b>speed</b> and autonomy. His first prototypes were mass-produced by the Russian navy, but the lack of interest by the Russian authorities in the early 1890 s convinced him to settle in Paris. In 1896, he took part in a competition organized by the French Admiralty for a new type of submarine. The prize he received gave him enough freedom to pursue his activities as an inventor. He subsequently took an active interest in airplanes and conceived a propeller theory that drew him closer to Gustave Eiffel, who was himself involved in aerodynamics, and also collaborated with the Laboratoire aérodynamique dAuteuil. This Polish engineer died in 1938 after a long career entirely devoted to naval engineering and aviation...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decades {{problems}} related to ship manoeuvrability have gained more importance {{in the context of}} naval architecture. Among them, problems related to slow speed manoeuvrability, such as port manoeuvres and dynamic positioning (DP), for which less data is available with respect to the conventional manoeuvrability at cruising speed, have taken more and more importance. The classical manoeuvring models have been developed to evaluate the ship force for high forward speed and low drift angle, therefore in case of slow <b>speed</b> <b>manoeuvres,</b> where high angle of attack must be taken into account, they do not provide accurate results. Despite the lower number of studies, also in this case different models have been proposed by various authors during years. The accuracy of codes to predict the ship manoeuvring capabilities are, obviously, strongly correlated with the accuracy of the prediction of the ship hydrodynamic forces, which are computed via regression formulae based, commonly, on existing experimental data. In the case of slow <b>speed</b> <b>manoeuvring,</b> unfortunately, only few data are available, representing an issue for the prediction of ship capabilities. In the present paper at first a comparison of different empirical models to evaluate the main ship force components for slow <b>speed</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> is presented. Then a RANS approach in order to tune coefficients for low velocity models has been explored, in order to evaluate its ability to compensate the lack of experimental data and provide a suitable alternative in the design phases...|$|R

40|$|Low {{extracellular}} pH (pH(e)), that {{is characteristic}} of many tumours, tends to reduce the uptake of weakly basic drugs, such as doxorubicin, thereby conferring a degree of physiological resistance to chemotherapy. It has been assumed, from pH-partition theory, {{that the effect of}} intracellular pH (pH(i)) is symmetrically opposite, although this has not been tested experimentally. Doxorubicin uptake into colon HCT 116 cells was measured using the drug's intrinsic fluorescence under conditions that alter pH(i) and pH(e) or pH(i) alone. Acutely, doxorubicin influx across the cell-membrane correlates with the trans-membrane pH-gradient (facilitated at alkaline pH(e) and acidic pH(i)). However, the protonated molecule is not completely membrane-impermeant and, therefore, overall drug uptake is less pH(e) -sensitive than expected from pH-partitioning. Once inside cells, doxorubicin associates with slowly-releasing nuclear binding sites. The occupancy of these sites increases with pH(i), such that steady-state drug uptake can be greater with alkaline cytoplasm, in contradiction to pH-partition theory. Measurements of cell proliferation demonstrate that doxorubicin efficacy is enhanced at alkaline pH(i) and that pH-partition theory is inadequate to account for this. The limitations in the predictive power of pH-partition theory arise because it only accounts for the pH(i) /pH(e) -sensitivity of drug entry into cells but not the drug's subsequent interactions that, independently, show pH(i) -dependence. In summary, doxorubicin uptake into cells is favoured by high pH(e) and high pH(i). This modified formalism should be taken into account when <b>designing</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> aimed at increasing doxorubicin efficacy...|$|R
