40|$|ABSTRACT Titel: Music teachers’ <b>discretionary</b> <b>power</b> – {{possibilities}} and limitations. According to previous {{research in music}} education, during recent decades the working conditions for professional music teachers in schools have changed radically. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the working conditions of music teachers by focusing on their experiences of and ideas about <b>discretionary</b> <b>power</b> in their professional lives. This is accomplished by addressing the research questions: What does <b>discretionary</b> <b>power</b> mean to the music teachers? How and where is the <b>discretionary</b> <b>power</b> of music teachers created? What enabling and constraining processes {{in the creation of}} <b>discretionary</b> <b>power</b> can be identified? The theoretical framework rests on phenomenology and the assumption of the life-world as the complex, everyday world in which we live. In this study, the life-world is perceived as an intentional, lived and social world, and research is understood as the study of lived experience. The methodology is qualitative and the data collection was conducted as in-depth interviews. Student constructed three-dimensional models {{of what it means to}} be a music teacher were used as a ”key” to the life world in the interviews. The meaning of <b>discretionary</b> <b>power</b> is shaped in the interplay between knowledge, action and motivation. The creation of <b>discretionary</b> <b>power</b> develops when the inner reality of a music teacher corresponds to the shape and nature of external reality. In relationships with pupils and colleagues different proportions of power, control, demand, social support and trust can be identified. These illuminate the social processes through which <b>discretionary</b> <b>power</b> is created, and they are also enabling and constraining in various ways. The results are discussed as three themes; the meaning of <b>discretionary</b> <b>power</b> in the relationships between (i) music teachers and their institutional settings, (ii) music teachers and their tasks and (iii) music teachers and others. The findings point out the tension between enabling and constraining processes in these three themes. Meaning is formed together with pupils and colleagues. In conclusion, the knowledge base of <b>discretionary</b> <b>power</b> and the creation of <b>discretionary</b> <b>power</b> consist of three dimensions: knowledge about <b>discretionary</b> <b>power,</b> knowledge through <b>discretionary</b> <b>power</b> and knowledge in <b>discretionary</b> <b>power...</b>|$|R

5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the power to revoke television licences, purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's <b>discretionary</b> <b>powers.</b> His power to revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E

5|$|As regards a bill {{mentioned}} in paragraph 1, the President, acting {{in accordance with}} the advice of the Cabinet, may refer to a Constitutional Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill circumvents or curtails the <b>discretionary</b> <b>powers</b> conferred on him or her by the Constitution. If the Tribunal is of the opinion that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day after the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal feels that the bill does have the circumventing or curtailing effect, and the President either has withheld or withholds his assent to the bill, the Prime Minister may direct that the bill be submitted to the electors for a national referendum. In that case, the bill only becomes law if it is supported by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast at the referendum. If 30 days have expired after a bill has been presented to the President for assent and he or she has neither signified the withholding of assent nor referred the Bill to a Constitutional Tribunal, the bill is deemed to have been assented to on the day following the expiry of the 30-day period. The procedure is similar for a bill {{mentioned in}} paragraph 2, except that if the Constitutional Tribunal rules that the bill has a circumventing or curtailing effect, the Prime Minister has no power to put the bill to a referendum. This ensures that changes to the President's <b>discretionary</b> <b>powers</b> can only be made by way of constitutional amendments and not ordinary statutes.|$|E

5|$|One {{question}} of constitutional interpretation that was highlighted during the parliamentary debates pertained {{to the former}} Article 22H which had been incorrectly inserted into the Constitution by the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1991 in January 1991. Article 22H(1) provided that the President might, acting in his discretion, withhold his assent to any bill passed by Parliament (other than a bill to which Article 5(2A) applied) if the bill provided for the circumvention or curtailment of the <b>discretionary</b> <b>powers</b> conferred upon him by the Constitution.

5|$|Thio Li-ann has {{opined that}} the 1989 {{measures}} taken to limit judicial checks on executive power demonstrate {{a preference for}} non-legal institutional checks. One example of a non-legal institutional check is the requirement under the Constitution and the ISA for an advisory board to hear detainees' representations and recommend to the President whether a detention order should be terminated. Thio argues that such checks are weak and cannot replace judicial review. She contends that since Article149 of the Constitution permits the enactment of repressive laws which contravene constitutional liberties, meaningful restraints {{should be placed on}} the wide <b>discretionary</b> <b>powers</b> under the ISA. Similarly, in Chng Suan Tze, the Court of Appeal rejected the view that the executive's accountability to Parliament is a sufficient safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power.|$|E
5|$|In August 1994, Parliament {{intended}} to amend Article 22H {{to restrict the}} President's powers thereunder to only non-constitutional bills which provided for the circumvention or curtailment of the President's <b>discretionary</b> <b>powers</b> conferred upon him by the Constitution. Because Article 5(2A) was not in force, a question arose {{as to whether the}} President had the power under Article 22H(1) to withhold his assent to any bill seeking to amend any of the provisions referred to in Article 5(2A), and specifically to any bill seeking to amend Article 22H. President Ong Teng Cheong stated that in the interest of testing out the system, he wished to have this question referred to the courts for a ruling, and that he would accept as correct whatever interpretation of Article 22H was given by the court. In response to his request, Article 100 was inserted into the Constitution by Parliament for that purpose.|$|E
40|$|This paper uses Social Exchange Theory as a lens for {{comparing}} {{the impact of}} management support upon police perceptions of <b>discretionary</b> <b>power</b> and employee engagement, across three countries. A survey-based, self-report process collected data from 193 police officers in Australia, 588 from the USA, and 249 from Malta. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the data. The findings suggest a significantly different management support context across the three countries, as well as significantly different perceptions of <b>discretionary</b> <b>power.</b> Across the three countries, police perceived relatively poor satisfaction with organizational management support and only some engagement levels. However, USA police perceived significantly more <b>discretionary</b> <b>power</b> than the other country samples. These findings provide greater clarity about the link between management support, <b>discretionary</b> <b>power</b> and engagement for the police officers. Since employee engagement likely affects policing outcomes, {{the findings suggest that}} poor management support of police officers could negatively affect the provided service. Potential strategies to enhance police engagement include (a) training police managers about how to manage so as to promote greater engagement, and (b) modifying police managers’ performance indicators in line with achieving better police engagement. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Grou...|$|R

5|$|In the Republic of India, a {{governor}} is the constitutional head {{of each of}} the twenty-nine states. The governor is appointed by the President of India for a term of five years, and holds office at the President's pleasure. The governor is de jure head of the state government; all its executive actions are taken in the governor's name. However, the governor must act on the advice of the popularly elected council of ministers, headed by the chief minister, who thus hold de facto executive authority at the state-level. The Constitution of India also empowers the governor to act upon his or her own discretion, such as the ability to appoint or dismiss a ministry, recommend President's rule, or reserve bills for the President's assent. Over the years, the exercise of these <b>discretionary</b> <b>powers</b> have given rise to conflict between the elected chief minister and the central government–appointed governor.|$|E
5|$|When Article 5A {{is brought}} into force, the President will {{also be able to}} decline to assent to a bill seeking to amend the Constitution that has a direct or {{indirect}} effect of circumventing or curtailing his <b>discretionary</b> <b>powers.</b> In this case, the Cabinet may also advise the President to refer to the Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill indeed has this effect. If the Tribunal rules that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the Tribunal pronounces its opinion in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal decides to the contrary, the Prime Minister may opt to submit the bill to the electorate. If the bill is supported at a national referendum by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the results of the referendum have been published in the Government Gazette.|$|E
5|$|He {{sought to}} {{concentrate}} political power, and the emergency superpowers law giving <b>discretionary</b> <b>powers</b> {{to the president}} to change the national budget was periodically renewed. The Front for Victory (conceived as a lema of the PJ) became a political alliance of the PJ, pro-Kirchner factions in other parties, and minor left-wing parties. The progressivist population, lacking leadership since the crisis which discredited the UCR, also supported the new coalition. Most Peronists simply defected to the new party, {{and the end of}} the economic crisis and the discretionary control of state finances allowed Kirchner to discipline his allies and co-opt his rivals. As a consequence, the Congress became compliant and the opposition was unable to present a credible alternative to the government. In addition to concentrating power, Kirchner micromanaged most government tasks or assigned them to trusted aides regardless of cabinet hierarchy. He managed relations with the United States and Brazil, leaving relations with Bolivia and Venezuela in the hands of Minister of Federal Planning Julio de Vido. There were no cabinet meetings during Kirchner's presidency, rare in a national government; this may have been influenced by his governance of Santa Cruz, a sparsely-populated province in which the cabinet was of little use and decisions were primarily made by the governor.|$|E

5|$|On 25 January 1989, the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 and the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 {{were passed}} by Parliament {{to confirm the}} {{applicability}} of the subjective test laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the law governing judicial review of the executive's <b>discretionary</b> <b>powers</b> under the ISA. These Acts came into force on 27 and 30 January 1989 respectively. Speaking during the Second Reading of the constitutional amendment bill, Minister for Law S. Jayakumar said the Government was taking this step because it was of the view that the courts' application of an objective test would amount to judicial usurpation of the executive's functions in matters pertaining to national security, which the judiciary is ill-equipped to deal with. Its stance was that the objective test would empower the courts to substitute their views on the proper exercise of discretionary power conferred under the ISA for that of the executive in contravention of the separation of powers doctrine. Moreover, the judicial process, unlike executive decision-making, was not conducive to a swift response to national security threats. The courts, unlike the executive, lacked access to inadmissible evidence relevant to security matters, and judges did not possess the skill and knowledge of the security experts employed by the executive. Furthermore, the objective test did not find favour with the Government because it had been imported from the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth jurisdictions. Since the objective test had been formulated by foreign judges without consideration of Singapore's local conditions, the Government was averse to the idea of allowing the objective test to shape the development of Singapore law on matters of national security under the ISA.|$|E
