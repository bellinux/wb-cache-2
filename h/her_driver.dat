5|$|But Beyoncé is {{far from}} being all sentiment. Because a large part of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 is being a sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and reveling confidently— in it. The amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk rattler 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells <b>her</b> <b>driver</b> to put the partition up because 'I don’t need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses Monica Lewinsky as a euphemism for her man finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty'; and repeats that it took her '45 minutes to get all dressed up / and we ain’t even gonna make it to this club'. And in maybe the wildest moment in an album full of bold moves, Beyoncé actually slips in the French translation of Julianne Moore's 'Feminists love sex' monologue from The Big Lebowski.|$|E

50|$|In Enright v. Groves, a woman sued {{a police}} officer for false {{imprisonment}} after being arrested for not producing <b>her</b> <b>driver's</b> license.

She won her claim, despite having lost the case of not leashing her dog. The court reasoned that the officer did not have proper legal authority in arresting her, because he arrested her for not producing <b>her</b> <b>driver's</b> license (which itself was not a crime) {{as opposed to the}} dog leash violation.|$|R

He later commented about this period: [...] "I could have walked out, but, whatever my feelings, I loved Hattie and the children and I was certain—I had to be certain—that we could repair the damage". The affair caused a downturn in his health; he collapsed on holiday in Tangier in 1963 and was hospitalised in Gibraltar. He returned to London to find the situation between his wife and her lover was unchanged, which caused a relapse.|$|E
500|$|The second part, titled [...] "Partition", is {{preceded by}} the sound of paparazzi camera clicks and a window {{whirring}} up, which separates it from the first part [...] "Yoncé". [...] "Partition" [...] has a fractured production and is lyrically about the female protagonist having sex with her romantic interest in the backseat of a limousine. Caitlin White, writing for The 405, highlighted that the song details a romantic relationship in which women do not act as sexual objects during sexual intercourse but rather use [...] "the physical act of love as a form of agency", from which they derive pleasure. [...] "Partition" [...] gained significant attention for its explicit lyrics, with frequent references made to the opening lines of the first verse in which Beyoncé asks <b>her</b> <b>driver</b> to put up the partition.|$|E

Meanwhile, P. P. Arnold, a performer who {{reached a higher level}} of popularity in the UK than her native U.S., was unhappy with her backing band, The Blue Jays, and wanted a replacement. <b>Her</b> <b>driver</b> suggested Emerson would be able to put together such a group. Emerson agreed, but only on the condition the band could perform on their own as a warm-up act. Since it effectively meant getting two bands for the price of one, manager Andrew Loog Oldham readily agreed. Emerson recruited Jackson, drummer Ian Hague and ex-the Attack guitarist David O'List, the latter by recommendation from journalist Chris Welch. The name came from Arnold saying, [...] "Here comes the Naz", which the group misheard as [...] "the Nice".|$|E
500|$|In the World Rally Championship, Mouton made <b>her</b> <b>driver</b> {{debut in}} 1974, {{finishing}} 12th in the Tour de Corse in an Alpine A110.

At the end of the year, Mouton was crowned both French and European ladies' champion. Re-entering the Tour de Corse the following season, she took seventh place. Mouton successfully defended her ladies' titles, and also competed in circuit racing: In an all-female team with Christine Dacremont and Marianne Hoepfner, she won the two-litre prototype category of the 1975 24 Hours of Le Mans. Recalling the race in 2008, Mouton said: [...] "It started to rain I remember, and I started to pass everybody. I was running on slicks. In the pits they were saying 'Michele you must stop', but I did not want to because I was passing everyone." [...] Her results attracted a major sponsor {{in the form of the}} French oil company Elf. In 1976, Mouton drove the A110 to 11th place in Monte Carlo and retired at the Rallye Sanremo. At the Tour de Corse, her debut in the newer A310 also ended in retirement.|$|E
