The result of the amendments to the Act means that most United States taxpayers do not know how the VOA (and its successor agencies) operate or what their programming content was, as was noted in 1967 by the Stanton Commission report noted above. The act both insulates the American public from being targeted by the government-sponsored information and broadcasting which is directed at audiences beyond America's borders. Some experts claim that the United States is [...] "the only <b>industrialized</b> <b>democracy</b> to do this, and creates mistrust of the same activities in these audiences who increasingly question why Americans cannot read or hear the same material."

The present study finds that this line of argument is insufficient, and thus puts forward an alternative explanation. The identity explanation holds that Japan has been sympathetic to the special concern of the Southeast Asian countries over state sovereignty, and thus takes a non-intrusive approach. This is because while Japan sees itself as an advanced <b>industrialized</b> <b>democracy</b> it also identifies itself as an Asian country. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{shift in}} both the {{political}} and economic situations of Japan in the post- 1993 s caught the attention of observers because the abrupt changes were unparalleled in other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Politically, a single conservative party had dominated Japan’s electoral and government spheres in a way unmatched in any other <b>industrialized</b> <b>democracy</b> two-to-one majorities over the next largest party; complete control of all cabinet posts; and a relatively large influence of government over the economy. Economically too, Japan’s rapid growth had also been without parallel and had put it {{at the head of the}} countries called the “Asian dragons”. The national growth rates of Japan were also double those of other OECD countries in the postwar period; labour productivity in manufacturing and industry was far greater; unemployment and inflation were dramatically lower; saving rates of people remained consistently higher; and overseas investments and holdings exploded more dramatically. All these successes had shocked the rest of the world. However, the loss of the dominance by the LDP and the end of the high growth of Japan 2 ̆ 7 s economy in the early 1990 s contributed to what many Japanese have come to call the 2 ̆ 7 lost decade 2 ̆ 7 and resulted in serious debates over {{the political and economic}} direction of Japan.

40|$|Pregnancy {{among all}} {{teenagers}} {{is a major}} challenge facing the United States. A literature review indicated little research on the incidences of pregnancy and parenting among teenagers with disabilities, similarities and differences in their educational needs when compared to their non-disabled peers, and how programs address their specific educational needs regarding pregnancy and parenting. Our investigation includes a review of literature related to teen pregnancy, pregnant and parenting youth with disabilities, and programs designed to assist teen parents. It also alerts professionals {{to the lack of}} information regarding teens with disabilities who are pregnant or parenting and serves as a foundation for future research on the occurrences and educational needs of pregnant and parenting youth with disabilities. Rates for teen pregnancy in the U. S. are two times higher than any other <b>industrialized</b> <b>democracy</b> and continue to present many problems for society (Aspen Health and Administrative Development Group, 2000; Boonstra, 2002; Yampolskaya, Brown, & Vargo, 2005). Four of 10 pregnancies, approximately one million, occur in women younger than age 20. Teen pregnancy costs the nation seven billion dollars annually and can have a multi-generational impact (Koshar, 2001). In addition, the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy (2002) determined that one-fourth of teen mothers will have a second baby within one year of their first baby. The prevalence of teen pregnancy is reflected not only in the large number of babies born to teens, but also in the adverse consequences and problems associated with these teenage births (Bissell, 2000; Rolling & Burnett, 1997).

40|$|After {{nearly two}} decades of silence, Norway has reopened debate over joining the EC. In 1972 the {{electorate}} rejected membership in a referendum after a divisive campaign. The wounds opened by the campaign were so deep that Norwegian elites refused to discuss publicly the possibilities {{for membership in the}} EC for over fifteen years. Three events in the late 1980 s have forced Norway to reopen the debate. The passage of the Single European Act encouraged a revitalization of the EC that EFTA countries could not ignore. The EC and EFTA began negotiations to establish a European Economic Area. The second event was the fall in oil prices in 1986 that reminded Norway of its economic vulnerability. Finally, the ending of the Cold War made it possible for Sweden to apply for membership. The Swedish application has added urgency to the debate in Norway. The current debate is almost identical to the one in 1972. The supporters of membership come mainly from the urban business community. They are led by the Conservative party, {{a large portion of the}} Labor party, and the Progress party. The supporters are not well organized and the political parties do not work together. The opposition is made up of farmers, leftist intellectuals, and unions loyal to the Labor party. A large grassroots organization, Nei til EF, leads the opposition. Public opinion in Norway is split three ways between EC supporters, opponents, and the undecided. The conflict in Norway is really between two competing visions of the country. Opponents see Norway as a shining example of how an <b>industrialized</b> <b>democracy</b> should be governed. Norway would lose its distinctiveness if it joined the EC. Supporters of membership believe Norway is too small to remain isolated. It must defend its vital interests by being part of the European unification process.

This Article examines the legal, historical, and practical reasons for the Obama Administration 2 ̆ 7 s reluctance to “seek action” on the Covenant and explains why, despite these reasons, it should. Indeed, the United States has never needed the Economic Covenant more. The Covenant is a straightforward exposition of Franklin D. Roosevelt 2 ̆ 7 s “freedom from want,” an international instrument setting out what he {{referred to as the}} “Second Bill of Rights. ” It requires nation-states to recognize the rights of their people to the basic necessities of life, including work, an adequate standard of living, education, health, and social security. Every <b>industrialized</b> <b>democracy</b> except the United States has ratified it. Domestically, the Covenant resonates with the ground-breaking initiatives of the Obama Administration for universal healthcare, job creation, educational reform, and expanded benefits for the most vulnerable. Abroad, the Covenant 2 ̆ 7 s ratification would contribute to the “restoration” of America 2 ̆ 7 s reputation as a champion of human rights. The two major obstacles to ratification are the Tea Party and Goldman Sachs. The angry group of “patriots” and the financial services superstar are stand-ins, of course, for right-wing ideologues and the ultra-rich, who have not only grown fatter during the current famine, but now have the additional security of being “too big to fail. ” This Article uses stand-ins to give them a human face and bring them down to human scale.

40|$|The {{economic}} crises of the 20 th Century (from the Great Depression to the recessions of the 1970 s) {{were met with}} significant increases in compensation and protection for those most vulnerable to unemployment. Why has the Great Recession that started in 2007 promoted such muted response from the welfare states of <b>industrialized</b> <b>democracies?</b> In the following pages I argue that labor market dualization is {{a significant part of}} the answer. Dualization (an increasing separation between insiders and outsiders) has become an influential feature of most OECD economies since 1980. While a politically significant portion of insiders enjoys steadily high levels of employment protection, an increasingly numerous group of outsiders are unemployed or in precarious employment. Without the support of insiders, whose vulnerability to unemployment even during a crisis is low, governments have few incentives to promote generous social policy. I will show below that dualization has insulated insiders from unemployment during the crisis and has therefore mitigated the responsiveness of the welfare state to unemployment. 1.
