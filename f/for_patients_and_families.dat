50|$|A key {{principle}} of Singapore's national health scheme {{is that no}} medical service is provided free of charge, regardless {{of the level of}} subsidy, even within the public healthcare system.

At the highest level of subsidy, although each out-of-pocket expense is typically small, costs can accumulate and become substantial <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>families.</b> At the lowest level, the subsidy is in effect nonexistent, and patients are treated like private patients, even within the public system.|$|E
