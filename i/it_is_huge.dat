An immense {{elaboration}} of the picture and an immense sacrifice of everything else: it would take very little more to persuade me that {{that will be the}} only formula for our children. It's all right, when once we have buried our dead. I have no doubt that the scenic part of the art, remarkable as some of its achievements already appear to us, is only in its infancy, and that we are destined to see wonders done that we now but faintly conceive. The probable extension of the mechanical arts is infinite. [...] "Built in," [...] forsooth! We shall see castles and cities and mountains and rivers built in. Everything points that way; especially the constitution of the contemporary multitude. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>huge</b> and good-natured and common. It likes big, unmistakable, knock-down effects; it likes to get its money back in palpable, computable change. It's in a tremendous hurry, squeezed together, with a sort of generalized gape, and the last thing it expects of you is that you will spin things fine. You can't portray a character, alas, or even, vividly, any sort of human figure, unless, in some degree, you do that. Therefore the theatre, inevitably accommodating itself, will be at last a landscape without figures. I mean, of course, without figures that count. There will be little illustrations of costume stuck about--dressed manikins; but they'll have nothing to say: they won't even go through the form of speech.|$|E

50|$|Klaatu is {{a member}} of the {{extraterrestrial}} race called the Herm, and as such it is immensely powerful, and has been described as power incarnate. It can drain power off of large areas, such as New York, and add to its own power. It can disperse its atoms to feed on a larger area and then bring them back together. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>huge,</b> about as tall as a skyscraper, and is unable to be harmed by physical force, and the Hulk's mightiest blows did absolutely nothing. It is made up of energies and needs to consume them to survive. It can draw power from any electromagnetic energy source. It could fly through space unaided. It is however, susceptible to certain technology, which can injure, and even destroy it, such as special energy harpoons wielded by Xeron the Star-Slayer, and special energy blasts from the Andromeda Starship. It also cannot live for too long in an environment that is rich with oxygen.|$|E
5000|$|The Black Dog of Bouley (Le Chien de Bouley or, in Jèrriais, Le Tchan du Bouôle) is {{a monstrous}} hound that {{supposedly}} haunts {{the area around}} Bouley Bay in Jersey, Channel Islands. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>huge,</b> black, with eyes the size of saucers and (in some versions of the legend) a chain which it drags behind it, the sound of which is often the first warning victims have of its presence. After ambushing its victim it circles them at great speed, terrifying them, although never doing physical harm. Its appearance is said to herald a storm. [...] It has been theorised that {{the legend of the}} Black Dog was promoted - or even invented - by smugglers, perhaps {{with the aid of a}} costume, in order to keep people away from their activities in the Bay. Another theory has it that Le Tchan (‘The Dog’) is an aural corruption of Le Chouan, a Jèrriais term for a French Royalist émigré (many of which took refuge in the Island during the French Revolution), and the legend took off from there.|$|E

It's quite raw and honest, and it has got a healthy dose of Dingle craziness at the heart of it that threatens to derail things. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>huge</b> emotional territory, but it's not dancing girls and 'Dancing Queen'. It is kind of more Robert and Aaron than that, which I hope people will like. It's happening next year." [...] Danny Miller, who plays Aaron, was also present at the press conference - so this was all news to him, as he hasn't read the wedding script at the time. Danny said: [...] "I was just listening in! I haven't read anything myself yet. Like Iain said, it's next year. We only really get scripts about two or three weeks before we record them, so I've not read anything yet. I think Iain's right that it would be against the characters if it was too big, or a stereotypical big pink wedding. I think it's nice that they keep it to more of a Dingle-type celebration, I guess." ...|$|E
