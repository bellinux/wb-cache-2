5|$|Even {{before the}} election, {{tensions}} grew between the French and British delegations, already in Singapore. The Paris bid team considered submitting {{a complaint against}} London bid consultants Jim Sloman and Rod Sheard after they stated that the Stade de France was not adequate for athletics, an action that <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> IOC rules which forbid any bid to make statements about a rival bid. The London team promptly denied {{that the two men}} were under contract with the bid at that time, and underlined that their opinions did not reflect the views of the London bid.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, 9.4% of Wigan's {{population}} was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 12.4% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this {{slight increase in}} the middle classes of Wigan was {{the decline of the}} working class population. In 1931, 38.7% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 33.5% in Wigan and 26% nationwide. The rest of the {{population was}} made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers or other miscellaneous. The slow decrease in the working class <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> trend for a steeper national decline, reinforcing the perception of Wigan as a working-class town.|$|E

5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E

25|$|The hymn {{was one of}} the exclamations of {{the fathers}} at the Council of Chalcedon (451), and is common not only to all the Greek Oriental liturgies, but was used also in the Gallican Liturgy (see Saint Germain of Paris, d. 576), which shows that the hymn is ancient.

25|$|While {{the main}} intent of DRM {{is to prevent}} {{unauthorized}} copies of a product, there are mathematical models that suggest that DRM schemes can fail {{to do their job}} on multiple levels. Ironically, the biggest failure that can result from DRM is that they have a potential to increase the infringement rate of a product. This <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> held belief that DRM can always reduce unauthorized distribution. There also seems to be evidence that DRM will reduce profits.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} in northern Ireland gave Barkas {{the idea that}} every theatre of war is naturally patterned.

He developed a simple illustration of this point, by dropping a collar stud on a carpet. When it fell on a plain area, it was easy to see; when in a patterned area, it had to be searched for.|$|E

France must deal with its responsibilities and obligations as a signatory for the International Conventions and respect the European laws and its interpretation by the Court of Strasbourg, before one of its citizens become a victim of discrimination due to the law which you propose.|$|E
25|$|The Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions, {{along with}} the {{contemporary}} parallels found in Canaan and Wadi el-Hol, are thus hypothesized to show an intermediate step between Egyptian hieroglyphs and the Phoenician alphabet. Brian Colless (2014) notes that 18 of the 22 letters of the Phoenician alphabet have counterparts in the Byblos syllabary, {{and it seems that}} the proto-alphabet evolved as a simplification of the syllabary, moving from syllabic to consonantal writing, {{in the style of the}} Egyptian script (which did not normally indicate vowels); this <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Goldwasser hypothesis (2010) that the original alphabet was invented by ignorant miners in Sinai.|$|E

Bruce Kercher notes that this decision <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> then English principles of law relating to “convict attaint” which provides that a prisoner under sentence of death was unable to sue or hold property. Henry and Susannah Cable both were sentenced to death but had their sentence commuted to transportation, so under law, they were not entitled to sue.|$|E

25|$|Another {{source of}} {{inspiration}} for Braun consisted of the Priapistic rituals and orgiastic festivals of the Dionysus cult, as well as ceremonies in veneration of Aphrodite (Porne), the goddess of lust and patroness of courtesans. According to Braun, censorship itself is obscene, and the suppression of sexual desire by the political and religious establishment over the centuries has only led to psychological damage and frustration. In his 740-page novel Lady Caligula, Braun <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> grain by portraying Caligula as a brilliant character, instead of the deranged emperor described in Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and in I, Claudius.|$|E

25|$|Counterproductive work {{behavior}} (CWB) can {{be defined}} as employee behavior that <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> goals of an organization. These behaviors can be intentional or unintentional and result {{from a wide range of}} underlying causes and motivations. Some CWBs have instrumental motivations (e.g., theft). It has been proposed that a person-by-environment interaction can be utilized to explain a variety of counterproductive behaviors (Fox and Spector, 1999). For instance, an employee who sabotages another employee's work may do so because of lax supervision (environment) and underlying psychopathology (person) that work in concert to result in the counterproductive behavior. There is evidence that an emotional response (e.g., anger) to job stress (e.g., unfair treatment) can motivate CWBs.|$|E
