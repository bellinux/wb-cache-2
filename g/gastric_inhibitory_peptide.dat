40|$|BACKGROUND: After weight loss, {{changes in}} the {{circulating}} levels of several peripheral hormones involved in the homeostatic regulation of body weight occur. Whether these changes are transient or persist over time may be important for {{an understanding of the}} reasons behind the high rate of weight regain after diet-induced weight loss. METHODS: We enrolled 50 overweight or obese patients without diabetes in a 10 -week weight-loss program for which a very-low-energy diet was prescribed. At baseline (before weight loss), at 10 weeks (after program completion), and at 62 weeks, we examined circulating levels of leptin, ghrelin, <b>peptide</b> YY, <b>gastric</b> <b>inhibitory</b> polypeptide, glucagon-like <b>peptide</b> 1, amylin, pancreatic polypeptide, cholecystokinin, and insulin and subjective ratings of appetite. RESULTS: Weight loss (mean [±SE], 13. 5 ± 0. 5 kg) led to significant reductions in levels of leptin, peptide YY, cholecystokinin, insulin (P< 0. 001 for all comparisons), and amylin (P= 0. 002) and to increases in levels of ghrelin (P< 0. 001), <b>gastric</b> <b>inhibitory</b> polypeptide (P= 0. 004), and pancreatic polypeptide (P= 0. 008). There was also a significant increase in subjective appetite (P< 0. 001). One year after the initial weight loss, there were still significant differences from baseline in the mean levels of leptin (P< 0. 001), peptide YY (P< 0. 001), cholecystokinin (P= 0. 04), insulin (P= 0. 01), ghrelin (P< 0. 001), <b>gastric</b> <b>inhibitory</b> polypeptide (P< 0. 001), and pancreatic polypeptide (P= 0. 002), as well as hunger (P< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: One year after initial weight reduction, levels of the circulating mediators of appetite that encourage weight regain after diet-induced weight loss do not revert to the levels recorded before weight loss. Long-term strategies to counteract this change may be needed to prevent obesity relapse.

50|$|Incretins are a {{group of}} {{metabolic}} hormones that stimulate a decrease in blood glucose levels. Incretins are released after eating and augment the secretion of insulin released from pancreatic beta cells of the islets of Langerhans by a blood glucose-dependent mechanism. They also slow the rate of absorption of nutrients into the blood stream by reducing gastric emptying and may directly reduce food intake. They also inhibit glucagon release from the alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans. The two main candidate molecules that fulfill criteria for an incretin are the intestinal peptides glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and <b>gastric</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>peptide</b> (also known as: glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide or GIP).

40|$|Hypertension or {{high blood}} {{pressure}} is a significant health problem worldwide. Bioactive peptides that inhibit angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) in the cardiovascular system {{can contribute to the}} prevention and treatment of hypertension. These ACE <b>inhibitory</b> <b>peptides</b> are derived from many food proteins, especially milk proteins. An ACE inhibitory activity in vitro does not always imply an antihypertensive effect in vivo. Even if it does, {{it is very difficult to}} establish a direct relationship between in vitro and in vivo activity. This is mainly due to the bioavailability of the ACE <b>inhibitory</b> <b>peptides</b> after oral administration and the fact that peptides may influence blood pressure by mechanisms other than ACE inhibition. To exert an antihypertensive effect after oral ingestion, ACE <b>inhibitory</b> <b>peptides</b> have to reach the cardiovascular system in an active form. Therefore, they need to remain active during digestion by human proteases and be transported through the intestinal wall into the blood. The bioavailability of some ACE <b>inhibitory</b> <b>peptides</b> has been studied. It is also known that (hydroxy) proline-containing peptides are generally resistant to degradation by digestive enzymes. Peptides can be absorbed intact through the intestine by paracellular and transcellular routes, but the potency of the bioactivity after absorption is inversely correlated to chain length. In addition, some strategies are proposed to increase the bioavailability of ACE <b>inhibitory</b> <b>peptides.</b> Further research into the bioavailability of ACE <b>inhibitory</b> <b>peptides</b> will lead to the development of more effective ACE <b>inhibitory</b> <b>peptides</b> and foods.

50|$|Examples of {{releasing}} and inhibiting hormones for exocrine hormones are gastrin-releasing <b>peptide</b> (GRP) and <b>gastric</b> <b>inhibitory</b> polypeptide (GIP), which regulate gastrin production.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} polypeptidic hormones, mainly {{expressed}} in the intestine or the pancreas, belong {{to a group of}} these structurally related peptides. One such hormone, glucagon, is widely distributed and produced in the alpha-cells of pancreatic islets. It affects glucose metabolism in the liver by inhibiting glycogen synthesis, stimulating glycogenolysis and enchancing gluconeogenesis. It also increases mobilisation of glucose, free fatty acids and ketone bodies, which are metabolites produced in excess in diabetes mellitus. Glucagon is produced, like other peptide hormones, {{as part of a larger}} precursor (preproglucagon), which is cleaved to produce glucagon, glucagon-like protein I, glucagon-like protein II, and glicentin. The structure of glucagon itself is fully conserved in all mammalian species in which it has been studied. Other members of the structurally similar group include secretin, <b>gastric</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>peptide,</b> vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), prealbumin, peptide HI-27 and growth hormone releasing factor.|$|E
40|$|Potentiation of glucose-induced insulin {{secretion}} by intestinal factors {{has been}} described for many years. Today, two major peptides with potent insulinotropic action have been recognized: <b>gastric</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>peptide</b> and truncated forms of glucagon-like peptide I, GLP-l(7 - 37) or the related GLP-l(7 - 36) amide. These hormones have specific p-cell receptors that are coupled to production of cAMP and activation of CAMP-dependent protein kinase. Elevation in intracellular cAMP levels is required to mediate the glucoincretin effect of these hormones: the potentiation of insulin secretion {{in the presence of}} stlmulatory concentrations of glucose. In addition, circulating glucoincretins maintain basal levels of CAMP, which are necessary to keep p-cells in a glucose-competent state. Interactions between glucoincretin signaling and glucose-induced insulin secretion may result from the phosphorylation of key elements of the glucose signaling pathway by CAMP-dependent protein kinase. These include the ATP-dependent K+ channel, the Ca++ channel, or elements of the secretory machinery itself. In NIDDM, the glucoincretln effect is reduced. However, basal or stimulated <b>gastric</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>peptide</b> and glucagon-like peptide I levels are normal or even elevated, suggesting that signals induced by these hormones on the p-cells are probably altered. At pharmacological doses, infusion of glucagon-like peptide i but not <b>gastric</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>peptide,</b> can ameliorate postprandia...|$|E
