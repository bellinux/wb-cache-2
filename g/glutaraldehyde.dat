25|$|<b>Glutaraldehyde</b> and {{formaldehyde}} solutions (also used as fixatives) {{are accepted}} liquid sterilizing agents, {{provided that the}} immersion time is sufficiently long. To kill all spores in a clear liquid {{can take up to}} 22 hours with <b>glutaraldehyde</b> and even longer with formaldehyde. The presence of solid particles may lengthen the required period or render the treatment ineffective. Sterilization of blocks of tissue can take much longer, due to the time required for the fixative to penetrate. <b>Glutaraldehyde</b> and formaldehyde are volatile, and toxic by both skin contact and inhalation. <b>Glutaraldehyde</b> has a short shelf life (<2 weeks), and is expensive. Formaldehyde is less expensive and has a much longer shelf life if some methanol is added to inhibit polymerization to paraformaldehyde, but is much more volatile. Formaldehyde is also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent; in this case, it is prepared on-site by depolymerization of solid paraformaldehyde. Many vaccines, such as the original Salk polio vaccine, are sterilized with formaldehyde.|$|E

25|$|Prions {{are highly}} {{resistant}} to chemical sterilization. Treatment with aldehydes such as formaldehyde {{have actually been}} shown to increase prion resistance. Hydrogen peroxide (3%) for one hour was shown to be ineffective, providing less than 3 logs (10−3) reduction in contamination. Iodine, formaldehyde, <b>glutaraldehyde</b> and peracetic acid also fail this test (one hour treatment). Only chlorine, phenolic compounds, guanidinium thiocyanate, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) reduce prion levels by more than 4 logs; chlorine (too corrosive to use on certain objects) and NaOH are the most consistent. Many studies have shown the effectiveness of sodium hydroxide.|$|E
25|$|Scaffolds {{may also}} be {{constructed}} from natural materials: in particular different derivatives of the extracellular matrix have been studied to evaluate their ability to support cell growth. Proteic materials, such as collagen or fibrin, and polysaccharidic materials, like chitosan or glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), have all proved suitable in terms of cell compatibility, but some issues with potential immunogenicity still remains. Among GAGs hyaluronic acid, possibly in combination with cross linking agents (e.g. <b>glutaraldehyde,</b> water-soluble carbodiimide, etc.), {{is one of the}} possible choices as scaffold material. Functionalized groups of scaffolds may be useful in the delivery of small molecules (drugs) to specific tissues. Another form of scaffold under investigation is decellularised tissue extracts whereby the remaining cellular remnants/extracellular matrices act as the scaffold. Recently a range of nanocomposites biomaterials are fabricated by incorporating nanomaterials within polymeric matrix to engineer bioactive scaffolds.|$|E

2500|$|Fixation {{is usually}} {{performed}} by incubation {{in a solution}} of a buffered chemical fixative, such as <b>glutaraldehyde,</b> sometimes in combination with formaldehyde and other fixatives, and optionally followed by postfixation with osmium tetroxide. The fixed tissue is then dehydrated. Because air-drying causes collapse and shrinkage, this is commonly achieved by replacement {{of water in the}} cells with organic solvents such as ethanol or acetone, and replacement of these solvents in turn with a transitional fluid such as liquid carbon dioxide by critical point drying. The carbon dioxide is finally removed while in a supercritical state, so that no gas–liquid interface is present within the sample during drying.|$|E

50|$|Another popular {{aldehyde}} for fixation is <b>glutaraldehyde.</b> It {{operates in}} a similar way to formaldehyde by causing deformation of the alpha-helix structures in proteins. However <b>glutaraldehyde</b> is a larger molecule, and so its rate of diffusion across membranes is slower than formaldehyde. Consequently, <b>glutaraldehyde</b> fixation on thicker tissue samples may be hampered, but this problem can be overcome by reducing the size of the tissue sample. One of the advantages of <b>glutaraldehyde</b> fixation is that it may offer a more rigid or tightly linked fixed product - its greater length and two aldehyde groups allow it to 'bridge' and link more distant pairs of protein molecules. It causes rapid and irreversible changes, fixes quickly, is well suited for electron microscopy, fixes well at 4 oC, and gives best overall cytoplasmic and nuclear detail. However it is not ideal for immunohistochemistry staining.|$|E
