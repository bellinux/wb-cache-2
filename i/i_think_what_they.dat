(Bakhtin: 1981, 270) The grand ricits are great narratives and the narrative has an end in v i e w. It is a programme which tells how social justice is to be a c h i e v e d. And I think the post-structuralists, if I understand them right, imagine again and again that when a narrative is c o n s t r u c t e d, something is left out. Where an end is d e f i n e d, other ends are rejected, and one might not know what those ends a r e. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are about is asking over and over again, what is it that is left out? Can we know what is left out?

40|$|Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) - 2 Cue: Livestock viruses are a {{major threat}} both to animal health and to farmer income. In the case of sheep and goats, the virus known as PPR, short for Peste des Petits Ruminants, is {{particularly}} dangerous. Infected animals have {{a wide range of}} symptoms, but the most serious is diarrhoea. Animals that die from PPR usually die from dehydration. Treating the symptoms, for example by forcing the animal to drink fluids, and giving general antibiotics to fight secondary infections, can help to keep an animal alive until it recovers from the virus. But a much easier solution is to protect livestock from catching the disease through vaccination. The vaccine for PPR gives life long protection, so it only needs to be given once. And if farmers can organise themselves into a group to vaccinate their animals, they can reduce the cost to an affordable level. Dr Folashade Ajasin is a veterinary doctor at the College of Animal Health in Ibadan, Nigeria. She spoke to Tunde Fatunde about how farmers can recognise PPR when it occurs, and the benefits of vaccination. She begins by explaining the age at which sheep and goats are most vulnerable to the disease. IN:		?It is from the age of four months? OUT:		?That is when they rush to the veterinarian. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 07 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Folashade Ajasin, on the value of vaccination to protect sheep and goats against Peste des Petits Ruminants, also known as Goat Plague. Transcript Ajasin	It is from the age of four months up to about eight to ten months, that?s when they are usually more susceptible. When they are over eight to ten months, one way or another they would have come into contact with the virus and as such would have developed their own immunity at that age. The good thing about PPR is that you cannot easily pick it up from the air, the animals have to come into contact. Tunde		With what? Ajasin	With an infected animal, with secretions from an infected animal, or with a carcass of an infected animal. They can also pick up the infection when an animal that has no immunity, that has not been previously vaccinated, when they come in contact with the workers who had worked with infected animals or with utensils that had been used by infected animals, like the feed troughs and the water troughs. Tunde	Now what are the physical symptoms of an animal that contracts this disease PPR? Ajasin	The first thing a farmer would notice is that the animal would be dull. The coat, the hair would be rough. There would be no appetite. If it is possible to take the temperature there would be fever, the temperature would be high, as high as 40 - 41 degrees Celsius. When you open the mouth of the animal you will notice that there are areas of inflammation, redness around the gum and you also notice oral secretions from the mouth. It is the saliva, there is excess salivation but {{it is not enough to}} cause drooling. There is also secretions from the eyes and from the nose. The secretions from the nose is watery at the initial stage and with time, as time progresses it becomes thicker. Sometimes thick enough to be able to affect the breathing of the animal. You will notice that the animal has difficulty in breathing and sometimes these mucus secretions will form crusts in the nose and around the eye region. Tunde	What would they normally do when they discover these symptoms of PPR? I?m talking about the farmers. Ajasin	The farmers in most cases, for those of them who have access to veterinary doctors or personnel, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> normally do is to get in touch with their veterinary personnel to come and treat the animal so that as soon as possible the ones that have not been affected will be spared and the ones that have been affected, the effect will be reduced on them. Tunde	Is it that these animals are vaccinated, is there a kind of vaccine against PPR? Ajasin	Yes there is a vaccine against PPR. It is a vaccine that is meant for a disease that commonly affects cattle, known as cattle plague (rinderpest). But fortunately it has a relationship with the virus that is responsible for PPR in sheep and goats. So it is possible to use the vaccine meant for rinderpest disease to take care of PPR in goats. Tunde	Which means that once the farmer notices that the goats and sheep are behaving abnormally he takes them to the clinic and they are vaccinated against that. Is that a way of preventing these animals getting this common disease? Ajasin	Yes. First and foremost, by the time it starts having the infection it is almost too late to vaccinate against it. Although you can vaccinate those that have not come in contact with the affected ones it is advisable that the animals are vaccinated before they come down with the infection. Usually we recommend that the animals are vaccinated at 4 months. And the infection PPR is more common during the rainy season. We always advise our farmers just before the rainy season, if you have new stock you should do your vaccination, or if you are buying animals from the general markets and you don?t know if they have been vaccinated or not, that you should get them vaccinated before you mix them with your old stock on the farm. Tunde	What is the attitude of the farmers to PPR? Is it that they try to vaccinate all the goats and sheep or is it that they wait until these goats and sheep are affected or infected by PPR? Ajasin	It depends on where the farmers are located and it depends on the size of the farm and the experience of the farmer. For the very experienced ones they have learnt their lessons, they take their animals as soon as they have been purchased or as soon as they reach the age of four months for vaccination. For the not so experienced ones sometimes it is when they have an outbreak on their hands. That is when they rush to the veterinarian. End of track.

40|$|WHAT I {{am going}} to talk about is the {{relation}} of sensing to perceiving. We have all believed that we understood the process of sensation fairly well and that only the process of perception gave us difficulties. But I {{am going to}} suggest on the contrary that a straightforward theory of perception is possible and that it is our understanding of sensation which is confused. First let us make sure that there is really a problem in how to treat sensing and perceiving. Some psychologists now maintain that there is no difference between them in fact. The distinction has broken down; they say it has no validity and we should forget it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>what</b> <b>they</b> mean is this. An individual can make discriminations in many ways. We can say either that he is sensitive to many variables of stimulation or that he can experience many kinds of differences between things but what has importance, the argument goes, are only the facts of discrimination, not whether they are called sensory or perceptual. There is something valid in this argument. I would call it the experimentalist's position—stick to the facts and cut the cackle! It is enough to determine just what differences an animal, a child, or a man can respond to and what others he cannot. This limited aim of psychology might be called simple psychophysics (not metric psychophysics) and it is good experimental science. But it provides no explanation of how the individual keeps in touch with the environment around him. The problem of perception, then, the problem of contact with the environment, still remains. The variables of sensory discrimination are radically different from the variables of perceptual discrimination. The former are said to be dimensions like quality, intensity, extensity, and duration, dimensions of hue, brightness, and saturation, of pitch, loudness, and timbre, of pressure...|$|R
2500|$|At the time, most Christian music enthusiasts who weren't {{familiar}} with gothic music didn't {{know how to}} classify Prints of Darkness. It was most often compared {{to one of the}} best-known gothic rock groups, The Sisters of Mercy. The album displayed satirical lyrics, a theme Healy would later become known for. Both Dead Artist Syndrome and its gothic rock style achieved more notice after Blonde Vinyl Records reissued Prints of Darkness in late 1991. The album begins with the song [...] "Christmas", which is not a Christmas carol, but a rather sarcastic rock song that was said be [...] a denouncement of the secularization and commercialization of what has become known as the [...] "winter holiday season", Healy himself has stated [...] "Christmas". is about separation from faith, church, friends and family at what {{is supposed to be the}} best day of the year" [...] in many public and radio interviews. [...] "Amy" [...] is a haunting, romantic ballad, and while rumor to be about Amy Grant, Healy has stated [...] "it's not, but <b>I</b> let people <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want, that said the idea of Amy Grant actually hearing the song and being creeped out was amusing to me, it's my Alice Cooper side" [...] while [...] "Red" [...] is a gloomy piece about a man who is mourning the loss of his wife, who may have either cheated on him, divorced him or died. The lyrics are said to symbolically to describe the apostasy of many churches, and relate to the Bible's description of the Church as the [...] "Bride of Christ". The album ends with [...] "Reach" [...] which is a synthesizer-driven worship song.|$|R
5000|$|... "I <b>think</b> that <b>what</b> {{happened}} was that they created Chloe not really sure who {{she was going to}} be and what {{she was going to be}} doing. Then, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they wanted to keep her around - thank you, writers! And the best way to keep someone around is to attach them to a family member, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s just <b>what</b> <b>they</b> came up with." [...] —Hendrickson, on why the writers decided to make Chloe the daughter of Kate Linder's character Esther Valentine (2012) As her story progresses following her constant manipulative behavior, Chloe reveals her true identity: Kate Valentine, the daughter of the Chancellor maid Esther Valentine (Kate Linder). The storyline was dubbed [...] "Chloe is Kate". Hendrickson was pleased that the writers decided to give Chloe a backstory, saying, [...] "I was so excited when I found out Chloe was going to have some family ties. I knew it would give me, as an actor, a chance to finally explain to viewers why Chloe is the way she is." [...] The actress felt that her family reveal proved that she's not [...] "this bitch who likes to destroy people's lives", attesting her behavior to not being raised by parents; [...] "She never had anyone tell her wrong from right," [...] Hendrickson stated. Her backstory revealed that Chloe hadn't seen her mother or her employer Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) since she [...] "was young and overweight with braces". Kate Linder was also pleased with the writing direction, describing it as an [...] "honor" [...] to work with Hendrickson. She said, [...] "When they decided to bring Chloe back, I was stunned and pleasantly surprised. Maria Bell called me and told me that it was top secret. It was a great reveal." [...] Chloe initially gives Esther the cold shoulder. Of her reasoning behind this, Hendrickson said, [...] "Chloe is very young and immature — as well, hurt and ashamed about her upbringing. She’s not going to let her mother forget it easily." [...] She described their initial relationship as [...] "realistic" [...] and similar to [...] "a lot of mother-and-daughter relationships".|$|R
