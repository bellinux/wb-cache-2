40|$|ABSTRACT: Sarah Waller {{proposes that}} {{cognitive}} therapists and philosophical counselors ought {{to consider the}} feelings of the client of paramount importance in belief system change rather than the rationality of the belief system. I offer an alternative strategy of counseling that reinstates the place of rational belief revision while still respecting the importance of emotions. Waller claims that, because of the problem of under-determination, the counseling goal of rational belief revision can be trumped by the goal of improved client affect. I suggest that, if we consider a different ontology for the domain of counseling- one whose objects are dialogues (the goal of counseling becomes greater information of dialogues), we can accommodate a place for emotions in rational belief revision. I then note some limitations of the new proposal and the possibility of incommensurability in the comparison of our different views. Waller (2001) has recently put forward a novel strategy for philosophical counseling. She maintains that many theories of cognitive therapy and philosophical counseling hold that, because beliefs and emotional states are mutually influencing and reinforcing, beliefs can be implicated in sustaining the emotional states that they describe and explain. This explains, she says, why some cognitive therapies work. More controversially, she claims that, “the <b>feelings</b> <b>o...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines how}} construal level (i. e., how abstractly or concretely people represent information in memory) affects consumers ’ responses to mixed emotions appeals. The results of five studies show that, consistent with prior research, participants experienced discomfort when they encountered mixed emotions appeals and developed less favorable {{attitudes toward the}} ad relative to pure positive emotional appeals, {{but this was the}} case only for those who construed information at a concrete, low level. Participants who construed information at an abstract, high level did not experience much discomfort; hence, they found mixed emotions and pure positive emotional appeals equally persuasive. We further demonstrate that the chronic construal level associated with people’s age and cultural background underlies the moderating effects of age and culture on consumers’ attitudes toward mixed emotions appeals documented in prior research. Pleasure and pain, though directly opposite, are contrived to be constant companions. (Pierre Charron, French thinker) In a recent Bud Light commercial, a young woman was sharing her feelings of mixed emotions with her mother on her wedding day. While feeling happy and excited on this important day of her life, the bride expressed her worries and concerns and asked her mother how to make the marriage work. And the mother’s advice was to do the things he likes, including giving him his Bud Light. Based on recent findings that mixed emotions often lead to discomfort and in turn less favorable attitudes (Williams and Aaker 2002), the advertiser might be well advised to replace the ad with one that associates Bud Light with festive celebrations of the wedding rather than with the mixed <b>feelings</b> <b>o...</b>|$|E

40|$|The present {{paper was}} planned for {{this issue of}} our journal, which Geoffrey Leech and I {{intended}} to devote to Politeness phenomena across cultures. It is based on his article titled “Politeness: Is there an East-West Divide?” (2005) which he suggested as a theoretical framework and includes results of our discussions held during our personal meetings and our epistolary exchange. Unfortunately {{the final version of}} the paper was never read by Geoffrey Leech for the reasons we all sadly know. Nevertheless I decided to publish it as a tribute to him in the knowledge that the result was not going to have the degree of excellence it would have had if he were still with us today. I therefore apologise for any mistakes or misinterpretations of his thoughts that might be found in the paper. The aim of this article is to sum up the main ideas of Politeness Theory presented earlier in Leech 1983, 2003, 2005, and other publications and discuss how that theory applies (or fails to apply) to other languages, with the main emphasis on the Russian language and culture. The term ‘maxim’ used in Principles of Pragmatics (Leech 1983) is avoided here as much as possible, as it implies some kind of moral imperative, rather than a pragmatic constraint. Instead, a single constraint, which comprehends all the maxims (the Maxims of Tact, Generosity, Approbation, Modesty, Agreement, Sympathy), and is called the Grand Strategy of Politeness (GSP), is used. The GSP says: In order to be polite, S expresses or implies meanings which place a high value on what pertains to O- his/her wants, qualities, obligation, opinion, <b>feelings</b> (<b>O</b> = other person[s], [mainly the addressee, i. e. H = hearer]) or place a low value on what pertains to S (S = self, speaker). The essential point is that these are not separate, independent constraints or maxims: they are instances of the operation of the GSP as ‘super-maxim’ which is an overarching framework for studying linguistic politeness phenomena in communication. The following hypothesis will be put forward, and supported by limited evidence: that the GSP provides a very general explanation for communicative politeness phenomena in Western languages such as English, Eastern languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean, and Slavonic languages such as Russian as well with a few examples from other languages. This is not to deny the importance of quantitative and qualitative differences in the settings of social parameters and linguistic parameters of linguistic politeness in such languages. A framework such as the GSP provides the parameters of variation within which such differences can be studied. We do not imply that ethnic cultures are homogeneous and unchanging entities, and do not disregard the fact that generalizations about any culture can be dangerous as things may be different in different sub-cultures or discourse systems within the same ethnic culture. Therefore we are speaking here in very general terms, as we believe that there is a common core which distinguishes one communicative culture from another. Further still there are some general characteristics of behaviour which can be observed in different cultures (1). Hence this article argues that, despite differences, each of the languages and cultures discussed herein constitute a more or less unified system in terms of politeness norms and strategies, and that the GSP can be used as a tertium comparationis to study politeness phenomenon across languages and cultures...|$|E

The affixing of a prosthesis and the subsequent introduction of laparoscopic treatment have reduced complications and recurrences. The high incidence of seromas and high costs remain open problems. Methods: At our Department between January 2008 and December 2011, 87 patients (43 over 65 years), {{out of a total}} of 132, with defects of wall whose major axis was less than 10 cm, or minor and multiple defects (Swiss-cheese defect) on an axis not exceeding 12 cm underwent laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) with primary and transparietal closure of the hernial defect. Through small incisions in the skin we proceeded to close the parietal defect with sutures tied outside. Then the mesh was fixed as usual with double row of stitches and an overlap of 3 - 5 cm. Results: In all patients, 43 of them elderly, surgery was successfully conducted. The juxtaposition of the edges of the hernial defect has not been time consuming and has not developed new complications.

Na sitcom, a exposição, o conflito, o clímax e o desfecho acontecem todos em um episódio de menos de meia hora. Trata-se de um campo léxico-semântico que não contém todas as lexias de língua inglesa relacionadas ao tema amor, mas apenas aquelas encontradas no corpus escolhido, e a pesquisa foi restrita ao amor em suas acepções romântica e/ou sexual, específicas dos relacionamentos entre casais. Utilizamos a terminologia de Pottier (1978), que classifica as lexias em lexias simples, lexias compostas, lexias complexas e lexias textuais, e organizamos o campo léxico-semântico em estrutura taxonômica, de acordo com a metodologia descrita por Cruse (1986). Para a identificação dos traços de significação comuns que permitiram a inclusão das lexias no campo léxico-semântico e seu agrupamento em sub-campos, foram utilizados um dicionário monolíngüe (inglês) não simplificado, dois dicionários monolíngües (inglês) para aprendizes de inglês e um dicionário bilíngüe (inglês-português), além da análise dos contextos de ocorrência.

It is a lexical-semantic field which does not contain all the English lexical units related to the theme love, but only the ones found in the chosen corpus, and the research was restricted to the romantic and/or sexual aspects of love, specific of the relationships of couples.

In t r o d u c t i o n The ways in which family members emotionally respond to each other reveals a lot about the quality of their relationships. In healthy families, the members can respond {{with a wide range of}} emotions. For example, when something good happens to a family member, such as a promotion at work, the other members will most likely be happy and joyful. And if something bad happens to this same individual, such as losing a job, family members might be disappointed, sad, or even angry. In healthy families, members also respond with emotions that are appropriate for a given situation. Using the example above, it would be appropriate for family members to be very pleased with the individual who received the promotion after years of dedication to an employer.

Theoretical Touchstone. Newman's (1986) existing theory of health as expanding consciousness served as a theoretical touchstone for the findings. Newman's theory was particularly useful because it conceptualizes breast cancer as a meaningful part of the health of these women. Methodology. Qualitative research using a postmodern feminist phenomenological approach was utilized for this study. Data were generated using unstructured interviews. Colaizzi's (1978) method of data analysis was used in the study to analyze the audiotapes and written transcripts. A review of scholarly and fictional literature was done after the data analysis. The criteria of rigor commonly associated with scientific inquiry was performed according to Sandelowski's (1986) method for achieving auditability and credibility. Participants. The 18 participants ranged in age from 35 to 72, with a mean age of 52. The time range since diagnosis of breast cancer was 6 months to 20 years. The participants had varied treatment procedures, including lumpectomy, mastectomy and bone marrow transplant. Findings. Based on a qualitative analysis, four themes emerged related to describing the participant's experience of inner strength in living with breast cancer. All of the participants described a <b>feeling</b> process <b>o</b> f knowing and accepting they had breast cancer: Coming to Know. This seemed to lay the foundation for them to begin developing the strength needed to live a full and positive life. The participants made statements about their personality characteristics and the manner in which they dealt with things that personified a feisty, positive, playful and reflective self: Strength Within o f She Who Knows. Relatedness to others, self and God encompassed the third theme: Connection of She Who Knows. Having supportive family and friends, giving others a chance to show caring, and feeling God's presence were mentioned by the participants. The f ourth theme that emerged, Movement of She Who Knows, personified the inner strength moving, exchanging, harmonizing, and facilitating desired change...|$|R

They are generally considered helpful by parents, and objective studies report that in many different situations such courses {{have a positive effect}} on parenting. o	Parents of children with special needs face particular challenges. o	There are hardly any support courses that specifically target parents of children with special needs. o	In children’s services work with parents more widely there is a growing emphasis on parent-professional partnerships. Most parenting support courses however, are facilitated by professionals. What does this project add? o	The Insiders’ Guide parent support course is aimed specifically at parents of children with special needs. o	The course goes a long way to meeting their learning and support needs. o	It facilitated positive changes in parental confidence and competence (especially for those parents starting off <b>feeling</b> very unconfident). <b>o</b>	The course was oversubscribed, popular with parents (including parents who would not normally attend such courses), and had a very low drop out rate. o	The Insiders’ Guide course is co-facilitated by parents and professionals. o	Course facilitators valued the experience and most felt that it improved their parenting and/or practice. o	The evaluation provides evidence to suggest that the parent-professional facilitator partnership model is effective. o	What do we still need to find out? o	How the Insiders’ Guide matches up when directly compared to other forms of parenting support. o	Whether or not the positive effect of the course is sustained over time. o	Whether a group of entirely unconfident parents would find the course helpful. What aspects of the course would it be most worth taking away and copying in other contexts? o	Parent support course planners might usefully note that the combination of support, psychological reflection, information and education worked well. o	It is worth investing in the detail. Pre-visiting prospective course participants in their own homes prior to them signing up is particularly helpful for getting less confident parents along to the course. Providing nice refreshments, a pleasant environment and a take home gift were highly appreciated. o	The co-delivery model of the course (by a professional and a parent facilitator) was very effective and popular with participants and facilitators. It could be harnessed by children’s services to meet policy and practice objectives of partnership working in other contexts. o	Intensive co-training of facilitators appears to be crucial in ensuring this success...|$|R
