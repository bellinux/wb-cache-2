2500|$|The band left Jeepster in 2002, {{signing a}} four-album deal with Rough Trade Records. Their first album for Rough Trade, Dear Catastrophe Waitress, was {{released}} in 2003, and was produced by Trevor Horn. The album showed a markedly more [...] "produced" [...] sound compared to their first four LPs, as the band was making {{a concerted effort to}} produce more [...] "radio-friendly" [...] music. The album was warmly received and is credited with restoring the band's [...] "indie cred". The album also marked the return of Murdoch as the group's primary songwriter, following the poorly received Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant and Storytelling, both of which were more collaborative than the band's early work. A documentary DVD, Fans Only, was released by Jeepster in October 2003, featuring promotional videos, live clips and unreleased footage.

2500|$|Shortly after {{finishing}} work on Escape from L.A., John Carpenter {{was thinking about}} quitting filmmaking because [...] "it stopped being fun". Largo Entertainment approached him with a project called Vampires, an adaptation of the novel {{of the same name}} by John Steakley. They gave him two screenplays; each by Don Jakoby and Dan Mazur, respectively. Carpenter read both screenplays and the novel, and he saw the potential for a film he'd been interested in making. [...] "I went <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>office</b> and thought, 'It's going to be set in the American southwest and it's a western – Howard Hawks.'" [...] Vampires gave Carpenter the chance to do a western disguised as a horror film," [...] he said. [...] "The story is set up like a western. It's about killers for hire. They're a western cliché. In this movie they’re paid to kill vampires." [...] In terms of tone and look, Carpenter felt that his film was [...] "a little more like The Wild Bunch than Hawks in its style, but the feelings and the whole ending scene is a kind of replay on Red River." ...|$|E

During the early 1970s, Parks dealt with prescription drug abuse. He would later say of himself as being [...] "dead for five years", and spent {{the first half of}} the decade [...] "trying to regain an interest in living."

Right then, I knew that my days were numbered as a person really interested in the record business." [...] Speaking about his department during this time, Parks stated, [...] "I provided that each artist would get 25% of the net profits of the rentals or sales. It was going to be a very promising market for the artist. Warners soon tired of what I thought was a fair equation of participation in creative profits, and basically isolated me." ...|$|E

Soon after I had {{completed}} my Master’s degree {{in the autumn of}} 2009, I was sharing a cup of coffee with my close friend Peder Lundkvist at his new work. Peder had just signed up for PhD studies at Quality Technology and Management, the discipline of our master’s degree, so we sat there and enjoyed our coffee with our former teachers. We laughed and cheered at the fact that Peder had actually applied to a PhD-program, something that we had both sworn never to do just a few months earlier. Little did I know that my laughter was about to get stuck in my throat, but after we had finished our coffee someone suddenly pushed me into Bjarne Bergquist’s office, the head of the division, and before I knew it, a voice from the corridor declared: “he’s the new PhD student”. Some weeks later I stepped <b>into</b> <b>my</b> own <b>office</b> in that very same corridor, intensively wondering what I was doing. I would like to express my appreciation to my supervisors: Anders Segerstedt, Erik Vanhatalo, Bjarne Bergquist and Kerstin Vännman.

60|$|October 16th.--A {{day or two}} ago {{arrived the}} sad news {{of the loss of}} the Arctic by {{collision}} with a French steamer off Newfoundland, and the loss also of three or four hundred people. I have seldom been more affected by anything quite alien from my personal and friendly concerns, than by the death of Captain Luce and his son. The boy was a delicate lad, and it is said that he had never been absent from his mother till this time, when his father had taken him to England to consult a physician about a complaint in his hip. So his father, while the ship was sinking, was obliged to decide whether he would put the poor, weakly, timorous child on board the boat, to take his hard chance of life there, or keep him to go down with himself and the ship. He chose the latter; and within half an hour, I suppose, the boy was among the child-angels. Captain Luce could not do less than die, for his own part, with the responsibility of all those lost lives upon him. He may not have been in the least to blame for the calamity, but it was certainly too heavy a one for him to survive. He was a sensible man, and a gentleman, courteous, quiet, with something almost melancholy in his address and aspect. Oftentimes he has come <b>into</b> <b>my</b> inner <b>office</b> to say good-by before his departures, but I cannot precisely remember whether or no he took leave of me before this latest voyage. I never exchanged a great many words with him; but those were kind ones.|$|R
