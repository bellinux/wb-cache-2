It is well-known insurance company which wishes to create a holiday package for their agents. It is made according to the technique of the travel agent Traveller. First, all the requirements are consulted and the group of the clients is characterized. Then the destination and accommodation facility are chosen. Also the optional tours in the surrounding area and the programme for the group with partial itinerary are included. After that the calculation is accomplished. In the last chapter, this tour is compared with the competitors in the market. The benefit of this work is to create a special <b>incentive</b> <b>trip</b> with a complete program for insurance agents into a very popular tourist area...|$|E

40|$|The meeting {{industry}} forms a major {{element of the}} tourism industry. Furthermore, rapid developments point to the industry being more significant today than ever before. Conventions, exhibitions, fairs, congresses, conferences, and events are all constituents of this industry. Corporate events are important for corporate marketing, internally and externally, and corporations implement events as strategies for many reasons. Internal Corporate Events (ICE), such as company conferences, kick-offs, Christmas parties and <b>incentive</b> <b>trips,</b> are strategic corporate approaches to increase employee motivation and performance and to communicate to their employees. The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate the overall perspective on ICE, to describe its practice in corporations, to analyse {{its role as a}} communicational and motivational tool within corporations, and to recommend and discuss the possibility of evaluating ICE. The fieldwork research was undertaken with interviews and questionnaire surveys in Sweden of corporations that use ICE, of event companies and of industry organisations. The findings indicate that the event market in Sweden is successful and that ICE are a valuable tool to motivate, educate and strengthen employee relationships within companies and to communicate to the employees. Hence further research and emphasis in this area would be recommended...|$|R
40|$|Business tourism – principally, {{travel for}} commercial, {{professional}} and work-related purposes – represents the major non-leisure form of tourism, and business tourists are widely recognised as the highest-spending category of travellers. It is generally agreed (for example, Swarbrooke and Horner, 2001; Davidson and Cope, 2003; Rogers, 2003) that modern-day business tourism includes four principal forms of travel: journeys {{for the purpose}} of attending conferences and other types of meetings; journeys to attend an exhibition or trade fair; individual business trips; and <b>incentive</b> <b>trips</b> or <b>incentive</b> travel. While most forms of business tourism are self-explanatory, incentive travel is the name given to the travel, usually in groups, of employees who have been awarded a luxury trip, entirely paid for by their company, as a prize for high achievement at work. This is widely recognised {{as one of the most}} effective management tools for encouraging employees to be more productive and to make a greater contribution to their company’s profitability. In the vast majority of cases, therefore, each category of business tourism is in some way linked to the traveller’s professional life or to their role in the commercial processes that underpin much of modern business life. It is clear that conferences and <b>incentive</b> <b>trips</b> play a key role in fostering communication between members of the same profession or the same organisation and achieving greater business results. Most of the end-users of such events – those who invest their time in participating in conferences and incentive programmes – are people in some form of employment. For them, participating in these forms of business tourism can significantly contribute to their career development, as they represent important sources of information, motivation and networking opportunities. All businesses must adapt their products and services to meet the changing needs of their customers, and the conference and incentive travel sectors of the business tourism industry are no exception. They must constantly evolve in order to ensure that such business events effectively meet the needs and aspirations of each new generation of participants. This chapter examines the particular characteristics of Generation Y as business tourists and investigates how conferences and incentive programmes can be designed in such a way that they appeal to this youngest, but fastest-growing, segment of employees. The recommendations will be of interest to all intermediaries and suppliers in the conference and incentive travel sectors, including convention bureaux and other destination marketing organisations; destination management companies; professional conference organisers; incentive travel houses, venues and speakers...|$|R
40|$|To have a {{high rate}} of absence as well as {{employee}} turnover is very costly for organisations. Having personnel, who are motivated, inspired and diligent, might assist in avoiding such inconveniences. In today's global and increasingly competitive workplace, events have become a strategic means in many areas for companies to attract and retain both customers and employees. Corporate special events (CSE), such as Christmas parties, kick-offs, company celebrations, <b>incentive</b> <b>trips,</b> recognition dinners are one of the strategic tools available to companies {{that can be used to}} satisfy the social needs of the employee. CSE also provide an opportunity to communicate corporate policies, strategies and goals to employees, or to enhance the team spirit and the feeling of belonging to the company. Despite the enormous amounts spent on CSE annually, very few companies measure and evaluate the effects and potential benefits of the events. The main focus and purpose of this thesis was to examine how CSE are used in companies’ internal marketing (IM), as a strategic tool, to motivate and retain employees. More specifically we studied what perceptions managers and employees have of CPE; why they are being held, their potential benefits and effects on work motivation and employee retention, how these effects are being measured and evaluated, how they are used in IM, and how they contribute to form an organizational culture. We used five Swedish companies for our case study. In-depth interviews were conducted with both managers and employees in order to consider the two different perspectives...|$|R

40|$|The {{extent to}} which any city or country may be {{successfully}} branded, positioned and promoted as an events destination depends largely {{on the availability of}} a wide range of resources within the destination itself. These may include infrastructural, natural and cultural resources. However, increasingly, attention is focusing on human resources as a critical success factor in the events industry in general and the business events sector in particular. The dedication, expertise and creativity of all events professionals operating in any destination are clearly of great importance in determining that destination’s level of success in this industry. But while this has been widely acknowledged in the case of the men and women who conceive, plan and deliver the actual events (with job titles such as events managers, events planners and events coordinators), far less attention has been paid to the human resources element represented by those professionals who are responsible for marketing their destinations as attractive places in which to hold events. As competition to ‘win’ events of all types intensifies worldwide, it is becoming clear that the degree of success of any city or country in attracting such events depends partly on recruiting and retaining professionals of the right caliber into these key destination marketing positions. Destinations that are eager to succeed as places that host highly lucrative business events such as conventions and <b>incentive</b> <b>trips</b> need to attract and retain professional staff capable of using their initiative and innovative skills to secure these types of events for their particular city or country. Nevertheless, despite the widely-acknowledged importance of the role played by marketing professionals in attracting events to their destinations, very little is known about how these vital stakeholders are educated and trained for, as well as recruited into, such positions. This chapter therefore explores the issue of the education and careers backgrounds of professional staff in destination marketing organizations, with particular emphasis on those who are responsible for attracting business events to their destinations. It examines the {{extent to which}} the educational community is contributing to preparing young people for employment in these organizations and investigates the career paths that currently lead to this particular occupation...|$|R
5000|$|Desperate {{to reach}} the {{students}} LouAnne devises classroom exercises that teach similar principles to the prescribed work, but using themes and language that appeal to the streetwise students. She also tries to motivate them by giving them all an A grade {{from the beginning of}} the year, and arguing that the only thing required of them is that they maintain it. In order to introduce them to poetry, LouAnne uses the lyrics of Bob Dylan's [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] to teach symbolism and metaphor; once this is achieved, she progresses on to Dylan Thomas's [...] "Do not go gentle into that good night". LouAnne rewards the students liberally, using candy bars, reward <b>incentives,</b> and a <b>trip</b> to a theme park. Her methods attract the anger of the school authorities, George Grandey (Courtney B. Vance) and Carla Nichols (Robin Bartlett), who try to force her to remain within the curriculum.|$|R
40|$|This paper reports an {{analysis}} of Sydney commuters ‟ stated willingness to change their time of travel during the morning peak period in response to fare discounts and/or faster <b>trip</b> <b>incentives.</b> The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the peak spreading potential in an empirical case study of a Sydney urban rail corridor. Peak spreading is here understood to mean shifting the travel times of some passengers out of the most congested part of the peak. Survey results confirmed that differentiated service and fare policy measures offer peak spreading potential. In addition findings which are helpful in shaping peak spreading policies emerged, including the need for targeted measures, given that peak spreading potential sharply declines as displacement intervals increase. Work commitments emerged as a major barrier to peak spreading. Finally, it was found that a policy that would focus on morning peak demand management is also likely to address afternoon peak issues.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, development and initial {{implementation of a}} new commuter dashboard tool entitled AccessMyCommute for use by all MIT employees. This {{is the first in}} a series of new commuter benefit incentives that MIT will introduce during the 2015 - 2017 academic years to its employees in order to reduce parking demand and to increase campus sustainability. Previous research has suggested that both financial and non-monetary incentives can be effective at encouraging behavior change, and AccessMyCommute leverages that knowledge with the introduction of a number of non-monetary <b>incentives</b> including: real-time <b>trip</b> planning, carpool facilitation, and a leaderboard to exert social influence. The tool also provides a platform for introducing a variety of forms of financial incentives. Quality control and usability studies preceded implementation. Introduction of AccessMyCommute to the MIT community is documented, and a design for the first set of financial incentives is presented. The first set of financial incentives was conducted through the use of Point Programs in AccessMyCommute and all users were awarded points for their commutes based on levels of sustainability. Those points could then be redeemed for prizes including a small set-value or entries into lottery raffles for larger prizes. Initial results from the introduction of AccessMyCommute as well as the first point program suggest that in the absence of other incentives, particularly any disincentive to driving, commuters are unlikely to alter their mode. Point programs are effective as an incentive for commuters to log on to AccessMyCommute, but the number of employees participating is small and future work should aim to increase the number of participants. Finally, participation in the initial point program confirmed previous research that suggests that individuals exhibit riskseeking behavior in the face of uncertain gains. This information should be leveraged in future work with AccessMyCommute, particularly in conjunction with additional new commuter benefits and incentives to be offered by MIT in the next academic year. by Corey L.

40|$|The {{retail price}} for the best-selling {{cigarette}} brand in Austria currently includes 74 percent in taxes, more than {{in any of the}} neighboring countries. The tax rate is lowest in Slovakia (47 percent), the Czech Republic (50 percent) and Switzerland (55 percent). Smokers go to considerable lengths to shop for cheaper cigarettes abroad, especially at the airport duty free shops and at the road border crossing points. Annually, some 266 million people cross into Austria who are entitled to make direct imports of a certain quantity of cigarettes. Of them, almost one third are Austrians. The permitted limits for duty-free cigarette imports are normally utilized by just a fraction of those eligible. The current figure for direct imports by Austrians declined from 3. 8 to 1. 1 billion cigarettes, in consequence of the limit reduction on July 1, 1997. Low prices for cigarettes and petrol are <b>incentives</b> for shopping <b>trips</b> to the eastern neighbor states. This in turn may lead to increased direct imports of other goods and services. A day trip to Czechia or Slovakia is attractive not just for the low prices for food and restaurant meals but even more because of the cheap cigarettes. In Austria, every announcement of a price increase up to the mid 1980 s triggered significant sales before it became effective. Such sales were then more than compensated by slow sales afterwards because consumers used the price increase to restrict their smoking. In later years, that restraint following hoarding purchases has been less pronounced. It appears that the accumulated home stock tempts those smokers not weeded out by anti-smoking campaigns to step up their consumption. The Eastern opening has reduced domestic sales. Initially (1993) moderate, the slackening has accelerated markedly since 1995. For 1996, the drain was calculated at almost 2 billion cigarettes (about 15 percent of domestic sales). This estimate gets some verification from the development in 1997. After import from the Eastern countries was limited to 25 cigarettes per person, sales in Austria grew by more than 15 percent. As expected, Austrian consumers showed little response to changes in cigarette prices. Even income fluctuations did little to affect demand. The older the members of an Austrian household, the smaller will be the part of their income spent on tobacco products. Blue-collar workers spend most on tobacco. Tobacco consumption declines with the level of education achieved. Tabaksteuer und Zigarettenabsatz in Österreich; Tobacco Tax and Cigarette Sales in Austria...|$|R
40|$|I {{will report}} on my {{participation}} {{at both the}} WILU and CLA conference activities. I attended the WILU conference in Montreal May 25 – 27, 2009. Both theoretical models and concrete ideas of information literacy projects were presented that may translate well to the delivery of library services at AU Library. These will inform the new information literacy duties which I will be assigned in the coming months. While at the conference, I was selected to co-convene the Information Literacy Interest Group (ILIG) of CLA. This is meant as a transitional position to becoming convener within the year. This increases my personal involvement {{in this area of}} information literacy as well as the profile of Athabasca University Library in this area of librarianship. On May 29, 2009 at the CLA Conference and Trade Show, I set up my display booth with bilingual handouts and two posters, one French and one English. I was present at my booth during the conference’s trade show opening 10 : 30 am Sat. May 30 th, various times throughout the weekend, and during the required times on Sunday May 31 st. I feel the presentation was successful as I had contact with over 100 people during the weekend. Comments included that the presentation was extremely professional and the research encompassed fresh ideas. To my surprise, mine was the only fully translated presentation, a point well appreciated by the national audience. Many people contributed additional information about unexpected locations of libraries around the world, such as on camels or in taxi cabs. Discussions were also raised in areas of further research. I look forward to continuing my research. Interestingly, as I’m sure is not a surprise to anyone on the A&PDF committee, about 25 % of the questions I answered were about the uniqueness of Athabasca University and AU Library. This is an indirect positive outcome of my professional participation at this event. While at the CLA conference, I attended many sessions on information technology and open source options for libraries, which will directly inform my work with AU Library. As well, I co-facilitated a breakfast meeting of the national Information Literacy Interest Group (ILIG). This was my first meeting as co-convener of ILIG. I feel my attendance at both conferences exceeded my expectations of success, and will closely inform my work at AU Library over the next year. These posters cannot be posted to AU Space, as I do not have the legal permissions for electronic distribution of photos that I took of travel operations or hotels. I hold copyright of each photo, and could lawfully present these photos in person during the educational presentation at CLA. I do not have permission to distribute them. Thank you for the support of these professional endeavors and you continued work with the APDF Committee. Destination travel readers are those who seek reading material while at or en route to their destination. There is a growing trend of hotel and tour operators offering books on loan to their guests. This has meant that libraries are emerging as value added services to vacationing guests. Previously, tour promoters would focus their efforts on wooing travel agents with commission <b>incentives</b> and free <b>trips.</b> Now, in the era of DIY vacation planning, tour promoters need to differentiate themselves from their competitors through the services they offer that have meaning to the traveler. Increasingly, we find libraries listed along side chef to traveler ratios and the company’s socio-environmental responsibility as features of value to the discerning traveler. This presentation will explore the international world of travel reading and the role of libraries in various tourism ventures. Examples will be drawn from various cities around the world, including a Montreal auberge...|$|R
