5|$|Feit {{initially}} denied hearing Garza's confession in the rectory, but {{he later}} {{admitted to having}} done so. He accounted for his absence from the sanctuary by explaining that he had broken his glasses that night; {{he said that he}} often played with his glasses nervously as he listened to confession. Feit said that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>driven</b> back to the pastoral house to get another pair of glasses, and when he arrived he had no key, so he had to climb into the house on the second floor. He said that he sustained the scratches on his hands as was climbing the outside of the brick structure.|$|E
5|$|According to Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen, it took long {{to persuade}} Meisdalshagen to even take the post as Minister of Finance, {{and he was}} more {{interested}} in agro-economical questions than traditional planning of the economy. It was even said that Gerhardsen's Cabinet had an interest in luring Meisdalshagen away from the Parliament, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>driven</b> through significant increases in farmer's income, threatening the overall balance and planning of the state finances. In fact the income from farming, measured in the amount of money earned per decare, was doubled between the war's end in 1945 and 1950, when the Main Agreement for Agriculture, , was introduced. It regulated future price negotiations, and institutionalized the negotiating partners: the state {{on one side of the}} table, the Norwegian Agrarian Association and the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union on the other.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the evidence of witnesses and CCTV cameras, there was substantial forensic evidence linking him to the murders. Investigators found over a dozen bloodstains on his car, on his clothing and in his flat, all matching the victims. There were bloodstains on the boots with which he had kicked both Corcoran and Jordan, which he was still wearing {{at the time of}} his arrest. Smith had tried to clean his clothes in the bath of his flat along with a pair of trousers belonging to Corcoran, and a bag containing items belonging to Hyde was discovered outside. Detectives matched the tyre marks from his car, which had four different types of tyre, to the Worcestershire murder scene and to Corcoran's body, over which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>driven.</b> Paintwork and fragments of glass found on Jordan's body matched those from Smith's car, including a broken light cluster which he had thrown into the car's boot.|$|E
5|$|Father John learns the john's car {{belongs to}} an {{accountant}} named Steven Miller, who tells Father John the prostitute is Linda, an expensive call {{girl who is}} widely considered among the best at her profession. Meanwhile, Linda visits her dying, elderly stepfather Donald Dupree (Tom Carey), who repeatedly raped Linda in her childhood and ultimately set her {{on the path to}} prostitution. Linda confronts him about their past, but claims she has forgiven him his sins, even though he continues to deny any wrongdoing. A drunk Nadine goes to talk to Father John in confession about her loneliness and feelings for him. He admits to caring for her as well, but they agree to remain friends. Later, Father John hires Lloyd Montag (Bruce A. Young), an unemployed boxer at his church, to serve as his bodyguard as he talks to St. Clair. The pimp, who knows Lloyd from his boxing days, tells Father John what neighborhood Linda lives in. There, Father John and Lloyd find Zeke (Tony Papenfuss), a taxi driver who knows they are looking for Linda and agrees to take them to her apartment. Zeke explains <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>driven</b> her to the church when she first spoke to Father John at confession, and Zeke later visited the church to watch Father John preach.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, {{the owner}} and {{the driver of the}} chariot were {{different}} persons. In 416 BC, the Athenian general Alcibiades had seven chariots in the race, and came in first, second, and fourth; obviously, he could not have been racing all seven chariots himself. Philip II of Macedon also won an Olympic chariot race in an attempt to prove he was not a barbarian, although if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>driven</b> the chariot himself he would likely have been considered even lower than a barbarian. The poet Pindar did praise the courage of Herodotes of Thebes, however, for driving his own chariot. This rule also meant that women could win the race through ownership, despite the fact that women were not allowed to participate in or even watch the Games. This happened rarely, but a notable example is the Spartan Cynisca, daughter of Archidamus II, who won the chariot race twice. Chariot racing was a way for Greeks to demonstrate their prosperity at the games. The case of Alcibiades indicates also that chariot racing was an alternative route to public exposure and fame for the wealthy.|$|E

25|$|A {{preliminary}} inquiry {{was held in}} 2003, the testimony from which was covered by a publication ban until 2010. At the inquiry, the fact that Pickton {{had been charged with}} attempted murder in connection with the stabbing of prostitute Wendy Lynn Eistetter in 1997 was revealed. Eistetter testified at the inquiry that after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>driven</b> her to the Port Coquitlam farm and had sex with her, Pickton slapped a handcuff on her left hand and stabbed her in the abdomen. She stabbed Pickton in self defense. Later, both she and Pickton were treated at the same hospital, where staff used a key they found in Pickton's pocket to remove the handcuffs from the woman's wrist. The attempted-murder charge against Pickton was stayed on January 27, 1998, because the woman had drug addiction issues and prosecutors believed her too unstable for her testimony to help secure a conviction. The clothes and rubber boots Pickton had been wearing that evening were seized by police and left in an RCMP storage locker for more than seven years. Not until 2004 did lab testing show that the DNA of two missing women were on the items seized from Pickton in 1997.|$|E

500|$|Fleming {{had also}} begun to write the children's book Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang.

Fleming had seen the car's owner, Count Louis Zborowski race at the Brooklands race track. The origin of the name “Chitty Bang Bang” is disputed, but may also have been inspired by early aeronautical engineer Letitia Chitty. Like Zborowski, Fleming names his car because of the noise it made—and the noise a car made was important to Fleming.|$|E

[...] When another motorist had pulled him out, MacLean had attempted unsuccessfully to drive away with the chains still attached to his vehicle, for which he was charged. [...] He had reputedly asked Brownlee, then the Attorney General, to have the charges dropped. [...] Upon Brownlee's refusal, he had allegedly vowed to [...] "get" [...] him. [...] Finally, Brownlee made a point of noting that, as a medical student, Caldwell would have been well-positioned to coach MacMillan on her claims about the pills she was taking to avoid pregnancy. [...] According to Brownlee, the events alleged were a complete fabrication, the result of scheming by an opportunistic young medical student and his impressionable girlfriend, encouraged by a vindictive lawyer and unscrupulous political opponents.|$|E

Bouhanni crossed the line first, with Matthews just beating Niccolò Bonifazio (Trek–Segafredo) for second place, but the result was changed shortly after the stage. Bouhanni was relegated to third place after the jury decided that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>driven</b> the sprint dangerously, giving Matthews the stage victory and putting Bonifazio into second.
