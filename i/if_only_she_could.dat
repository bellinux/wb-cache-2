Maria {{attempted}} to befriend her guards both at Tsarskoye Selo and Tobolsk and soon learned their names and details about their wives and children. Unaware of her danger, she commented at Tobolsk {{that she would be}} happy to live there indefinitely <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> take a walk outside without being guarded continuously. Still, she was aware that she was being watched constantly. Maria and her sister Anastasia burned their letters and diaries in April 1918 because they feared their possessions would be searched.|$|E
500|$|She summoned {{church leaders}} {{from both sides}} to attempt to solve their doctrinal differences. Despite her optimism, the {{resulting}} Colloquy of Poissy ended in failure on 13 October 1561, dissolving itself without her permission. Catherine failed because she saw the religious divide only in political terms. In the words of historian R. J. Knecht, [...] "she underestimated the strength of religious conviction, imagining that all would be well <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get the party leaders to agree". In January 1562, Catherine issued the tolerant Edict of Saint-Germain in a further attempt to build bridges with the Protestants. On 1 March 1562, however, in an incident known as the Massacre of Vassy, the Duke of Guise and his men attacked worshipping Huguenots in a barn at Vassy (Wassy), killing 74 and wounding 104. Guise, who called the massacre [...] "a regrettable accident", was cheered as a hero {{in the streets of}} Paris while the Huguenots called for revenge. The massacre lit the fuse that sparked the French Wars of Religion. For the next thirty years, France found itself in a state of either civil war or armed truce.|$|E

6000|$|Had she altered? Her {{mind was}} in a whirl. This thing had {{affected}} her like some physical shock. The crowds and noises of the street bewildered her. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get away from them and think quietly-- ...|$|E
60|$|It was the work, she {{explained}} {{as they walked}} on. It made your hands like that after a time. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have {{got out of it}} earlier! But now! It was no good worrying about it now.|$|E

60|$|He {{was moved}} by the {{vibrating}} quality of the last words. She seemed to be talking low of some wonderful enchantment, in mysterious terms of special significance. He thought that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>only</b> <b>could</b> talk to him in some unknown tongue, she would enslave him altogether by the sheer beauty of the sound, suggesting infinite depths of wisdom and feeling.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are prejudiced, {{like your}} poor dear mother--the best of women, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> ever have done justice to her Ladyship! Don't you see, child, Aurelia {{would not be}} gone before his return, supposing he should come this way." ...|$|E
60|$|She flushed at {{a sudden}} thought. Of {{course there was}} {{something}} George could do for her if he were willing.

The lady, lofty as she appears to be, would be flattered <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>only</b> <b>could</b> know how much you study them. Have you decided to thank her for them?

50|$|Reunited, the two visited Puerto Arena {{to visit}} Luis's estranged {{youngest}} sister, Paloma. As a baby, Paloma {{had been sent}} away by her mother to be raised by Pilar's sister Maria.

50|$|The third night, Kate said <b>she</b> {{would stay}} <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> marry the prince, and that night, the baby {{played with a}} bird, three bites of which would cure the sick prince. She distracted the baby with the nuts again to get it. As soon as they {{returned}} to the castle, she cooked it, and the prince was cured by eating it. Meanwhile, his brother had seen Anne {{and fell in love with}} her, so they all married — the sick brother to the well sister, and the well brother to the sick sister.|$|R
6000|$|His hands, {{that seemed}} to have no power or purpose, touched her cheeks, {{mechanically}} caressing. More than disgust, she felt that awful pity. Putting her arm round his waist, she moved with him toward the stairs. If only no one heard; <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get him quietly up! And she murmured: ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{keep him}} in this way! If he would only {{talk to her about}} {{anything}} but his passion! [...] "It seemed to me so, of course.

60|$|On the {{following}} morning, as it chanced, Eve had no relish {{for the food}} that was brought to her, for confinement in that narrow place had robbed her of her appetite. Also she had suffered much from grievous fear and doubt, for whatever she might say to Acour, how could she be sure that his story was not true? How could she be sure that her lover did not, in fact, now lie dead at the headsman's hands? Such things often happened when kings were wroth and would not listen. Or perhaps Acour himself had found and murdered him, or hired others to do the deed. She did not know, and, imprisoned here without a friend, what means had she of coming at the truth? Oh! <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> escape! <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> speak with Sir Andrew for one brief minute, she, poor fool, who had walked into this trap of her own will.|$|E
6000|$|But then I {{have had}} my game of rounders. No horrible old earl with gloating eyes carried me {{off in my}} {{childhood}} and robbed me of the pleasure of my youth. That part of my cake has been eaten, and, in spite of some occasional headache, has been digested not altogether unsatisfactorily. Lady Desmond had as yet been allowed no slice of her cake. She had never yet taken her side in any game of rounders. But she too had looked on and seen how jocund was the play; she also had acknowledged that that running in the ring, that stout hitting of the ball, that innocent craft, that bringing back by her own skill and with her own hand of some long-backed fellow, would be pleasant to her {{as well as to}} others. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> now <b>could</b> be chosen in at that game! But what if the side that she cared for would not have her? ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Waddington was too proud, too {{conscious}} of the necessity to maintain her pride at the present moment to contradict this. But, nevertheless, in her heart {{she felt that she}} did love him, that she would fain not give him up, that, in spite of his anger, his bitter railing anger, she would keep him close to her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>only</b> <b>could</b> do so. But now that he spoke of giving her up, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not speak passionately of her love--she who had never yet shown any passion in her speech to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, of course, I couldn't bring them. They {{were little}} dirty things--I couldn't have them about; and, besides, they took {{up too much}} of her time; but I believe that Mammy has always kept up a sort of sulkiness about this. She won't marry anybody else; and I do believe, now, though she knows how {{necessary}} she is to me, and how feeble my health is, she {{would go back to}} her husband tomorrow, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>only</b> <b>could.</b> I do, indeed," [...] said Marie; [...] "they are just so selfish, now, the best of them." ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{she saw it}} all {{as clear}} as daylight; and in her heart she swore, {{helpless}} as she seemed to be, that she {{would find a way}} to prevent it. But what way? what way? Ah, if only John were here! but he was not, so she must act without him <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see the road to action. She thought first of all of going down boldly to face Muller and denounce him as a murderer before his men; but a moment's reflection showed that this was impracticable. For his own safety he would be obliged to stop her mouth somehow, and the best she could expect would be to be incarcerated and rendered quite powerless. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> manage to communicate with Bessie! At any rate it was absolutely necessary that she should know what was happening. She might as well be a hundred miles away as a hundred yards.|$|E
60|$|She coaxes you to {{tell her}} of her faults. When you have {{finished}} she asks for more--reminds you {{of one or two}} you had missed out. She wonders why it is that she is always wrong. There must be a reason for it; <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> discover it. She wonders how it is that people can put up with her--thinks it so good of them.|$|E
6000|$|Yet {{instinct}} in {{her still}} struggled for freedom. Ahead of her, and all around, beyond {{the tent and}} {{in the far distance}} there was a provocative alluring darkness: if she only could get away, only could reach the shelter of that remote and sombre distance, she would hide, and wait, not blunder again, oh no! she would be prudent and wary, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get away! ...|$|E
6000|$|Ah, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> and Skrebensky <b>could</b> get out, {{dismount}} {{into this}} enchanted land where {{nobody had ever}} been before! Then they would be enchanted people, they would put off the dull, customary self. If she were wandering there, on that hill-slope under a silvery, changing sky, in which many rooks melted like hurrying showers of blots! If they could walk past the wetted hay-swaths, smelling the early evening, and pass in to the wood where the honeysuckle scent was sweet on the cold tang in the air, and showers of drops fell when one brushed a bough, cold and lovely on the face! ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the way to}} the captain’s wife Ekke Nekkepenn, who {{has turned}} into a {{handsome}} sailor, meets their young daughter Inge at Rantum’s beach. Against her will he sticks on each of her fingers a gold ring, hangs a gold chain around her neck, and declares her his bride. When the girl tearfully asks him to release her, he replies that he <b>could</b> do this <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> tell him his name the next night. But no one on the island knows the stranger. As Inge walks along the beach in despair the next evening, she hears at the southern time at Hörnum a voice from the mountain, who sings: ...|$|R
50|$|Julie Pottinger {{was raised}} {{primarily}} in New England, although she {{spent much of}} her time in California after her parents divorced. Even as a small child she devoured books. Her father disagreed with her choices of reading material, Sweet Dreams and the Sweet Valley High books, and told her <b>she</b> <b>could</b> keep reading them <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> prove that they were good for her. She promptly told him that she was studying them in order to write one herself. Challenged to prove that she meant her statement, Pottinger sat down at their early computer and wrote her first two chapters. After finishing her novel three years later, she submitted it to Sweet Dreams, but was rejected.|$|R
60|$|She looked {{round her}} eagerly at the tall cliffs, the lonely hut, the great stretch of rocky beach. Somewhere there, {{above or below}} her, behind a boulder or inside a crevice, but still hidden from her longing, feverish eyes, must be the owner of that voice, which once used to irritate her, but now would make her the happiest woman in Europe, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> locate it.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my dear Mrs. Proudie, who {{on earth}} {{could talk to}} Lord Dumbello?" [...] Mrs. Proudie thought that her own {{daughter}} Olivia would undoubtedly {{be able to do}} so, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get the opportunity. But, then, Olivia had so much conversation. And while the two ladies were yet looking at the youthful pair, Lord Dumbello did speak again. [...] "I think I have had enough of this now," [...] said he, addressing himself to Griselda.|$|E
6000|$|But Mr. Prendergast {{was not yet}} {{persuaded that}} he could not get from the good old woman the {{information}} that he wanted, and he was persuaded that she had the information <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be prevailed upon to impart it. So he again stopped her, though on this occasion she made some slight attempt to pass him by as she did so. [...] "I don't think," [...] said she, [...] "that there will be much use in my staying here longer." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Tom Joseph founded Bookminders {{with the idea}} that he could attract top tier talent if he offered a {{flexible}} work environment. It’s a concept he devised when implementing an accounting system for his father’s business. His sister agreed to act as the company’s bookkeeper, but <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do most of the work from home. They created an arrangement in which she would go onsite each week to collect their financial data but did the data entry from home when her schedule allowed. The seed of an idea was planted in Joseph’s mind. While conventional home-based businesses usually have a goal of growing beyond the home, Joseph’s goal was to grow Bookminders into a company of home-based accountants. The company expanded to Philadelphia in 2006.|$|R

"Ah! don't {{you see the}} tone, as if {{she were}} not fully satisfied, as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>only</b> <b>could</b> not see surface faults in me," [...] said Flora; [...] "and how she said she dreaded my love of praise, and of being liked. I wonder how it would have been if she had lived. I have looked back so often in the past year, and I think the {{hollowness}} began from that time. It might have been there before, but I am not so sure. You see, at that dreadful time, after the accident, I was the eldest who was able to be efficient, and much more useful than poor Ethel. I think the credit I gained made me think myself perfection, and I never did anything afterwards but seek my own honour." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{night in}} bed, excited {{and a little}} flushed still by her {{glass of wine and}} the secrecy of the second toast, she lay with her prayer-book opened flat, and her eyes fixed on a ceiling yellowed by the light from her reading-lamp. Young things! It was so nice for them all! And she would be so happy if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see dear Soames happy. But, of course, he must be now, in spite of what Imogen had said. He would have all that he wanted: property, and wife, and {{children}}! And he would live to a green old age, like his dear father, and forget all about Irene and that dreadful case. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> herself <b>could</b> be here to buy his children their first rocking-horse! Smither should choose it for her at the stores, nice and dappled. Ah! how Roger used to rock her until she fell off! Oh dear! {{that was a long time}} ago! It was! 'In my Father's house are many mansions--'A little scrattling noise caught her ear--'but no mice!' she thought mechanically. The noise increased. There! it was a mouse! How naughty of Smither to say there wasn't! It would be eating through the wainscot before they knew where they were, and they would have to have the builders in. They were such destructive things! And she lay, with her eyes just moving, following in her mind that little scrattling sound, and waiting for sleep to release her from it.|$|R
