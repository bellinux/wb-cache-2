40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{kinematics}} and muscle activity between chin-ups and lat-pull down exercises and between muscle groups during the two exercises. Normalized electromyography (EMG) of biceps brachii (BB), triceps brachii (TB), pectoralis major (PM), latissimus dorsi (LD), rectus abdominus (RA), and erector spinae (ES) and kinematics of back, shoulder, and seventh cervical vertebrae (C 7) was analysed during chin-ups and lat-pull down exercises. Normalized EMG of BB and ES and kinematics of shoulder and C 7 for chin-ups <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> lat-pull down exercises during the concentric phase (p < 0. 05). For the eccentric phase, RA during lat-pull down exercises <b>was</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> chin-ups and the kinematics of C 7 during chin-ups <b>was</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> lat-pull down exercises (p < 0. 05). For chin-ups, BB, LD, and ES <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> PM during the concentric phase, whereas BB and LD <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> TB, and LD <b>was</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> RA during the eccentric phase (p < 0. 05). For lat-pull down exercise, BB and LD <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> PM, TB, and ES during the concentric phase, whereas LD <b>was</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> PM, TB, and BB during the eccentric phase (p < 0. 05).

5|$|This result suffices to {{show that}} the number of steps in Euclid's {{algorithm}} can never be more than five times the number of its digits (base 10). For if the algorithm requires N steps, then b <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> or equal to F'N+1 which in turn <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> or equal to φ'N1, where φ is the golden ratio. Since b≥φ'N1, then N1≤logφ'b. Since log10φ>1/5, (N1)/5< log10φ logφ'b = log10b. Thus, N ≤ 5 log10b. Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than O(h) divisions, where h is the number of digits in the smaller number b.|$|E
