5|$|Among insects, {{so-called}} killer bees were accidentally {{created during}} {{an attempt to}} breed a strain of bees that would both produce more honey and be better adapted to tropical conditions. It was done by crossing a <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> and an African bee.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduced}} <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> (Apis mellifera) {{has also}} been observed feeding on B.sessilis, as have seven species of native bee, comprising four species of Hylaeus (including the banksia bee H. alcyoneus), two of Leioproctus, and a Lasioglossum.|$|E
5|$|Karl von Frisch (1886–1982) {{studied the}} <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bee,</b> demonstrating that bees can {{recognize}} a desired compass direction {{in three different}} ways: by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth’s magnetic field. He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark beehive.|$|E
50|$|Beekeepers in Japan {{attempted}} to introduce <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (Apis mellifera) {{for the sake}} of their high productivity. However, <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> have no innate defense against Japanese giant hornets, which can rapidly destroy their colonies.|$|R
25|$|For example, <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (Apis mellifera) forage at older {{ages and}} harvest less pollen and more {{concentrated}} nectar. The differences in resources emphasized during harvesting {{are a result}} of the <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bee's</b> sensitivity to sucrose at higher concentrations.|$|R
50|$|In Japan, beekeepers often prefer <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> {{because they}} are more {{productive}} than the endemic Japanese <b>honey</b> <b>bees.</b> However, {{it can be difficult to}} maintain a captive hive of <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees,</b> as the giant hornets are devastating to the bee hives. Once a Japanese giant hornet has located a hive of <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> it leaves pheromone markers around it that quickly attract nest-mates to converge on the hive. An individual hornet can kill forty <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> a minute while a group of 30 hornets can destroy an entire hive containing 30,000 bees in less than four hours. The hornets kill and dismember the bees, returning to their nest with the bee thoraxes, which they feed to their larvae, leaving heads and limbs behind. The <b>honey</b> and <b>bee</b> larvae are also taken to feed the hornet larvae.|$|R
5|$|Bird {{species that}} have been {{observed}} foraging and feeding at the flowers include the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), Lewin's honeyeater (Meliphaga lewinii), brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta), tawny-crowned honeyeater (Gliciphila melanops), yellow-faced honeyeater (Lichenostomus chrysops), white-plumed honeyeater (L.penicillatus), white-cheeked honeyeater (Phylidonyris niger), New Holland honeyeater (P.novaehollandiae), noisy friarbird (Philemon corniculatus), noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala) and eastern spinebill (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris). Insects recorded visiting flower spikes include the <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> and ants. The swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) eats new shoots that grow from lignotubers after bushfire.|$|E
5|$|Native mammals, such as {{the brown}} antechinus and sugar glider, are {{important}} pollinators of B. paludosa. Several species of honeyeaters visit the flower spikes, as do ants and the <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bee.</b> The response to bushfire depends on the subspecies; subspecies paludosa regenerates from underground lignotubers, while plants of subspecies astrolux are killed by fire and regenerate from large stores of seed which have been held in cones in the plant canopy. B. paludosa is sometimes seen in cultivation, with dwarf forms being registered and sold.|$|E
5|$|The flower {{spikes of}} B. paludosa {{are unable to}} self-pollinate and require pollinators to set seed. A 1988 isozyme study showed very high rates of outcrossing; pollen from one plant is well-mixed among other plants in the locale. Nonflying mammals are {{important}} pollinators in heathland habitat, with the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii) a frequent visitor to flower spikes. The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) is another mammal pollinator. Bird species that have been observed foraging and feeding at the flowers include the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), yellow-faced honeyeater (Lichenostomus chrysops), white-eared honeyeater (L. leucotis), crescent honeyeater (Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera), New Holland honeyeater (P.novaehollandiae), and eastern spinebill (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris). Insects recorded visiting flower spikes include the <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> and ants.|$|E
25|$|Africanized {{bees are}} {{typically}} much more defensive than {{other species of}} bee, and react to disturbances faster than <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees.</b> They can chase a person {{a quarter of a}} mile (400 m); they have killed some 1,000 humans, with victims receiving ten times more stings than from <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees.</b> They have also killed horses and other animals.|$|R
40|$|African <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (Apis mellifera scutellata) {{are native}} to sub-Saharan Africa and were {{introduced}} in the Americas to improve honey production in the tropics. These African <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> were accidentally released and began to interbreed with <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (Apis mellifera ligustica), the most common subspecies used for pollination and honey production in the United States (Fig. 1). As a result, the hybrid offspring are called “Africanized” because of their shared characteristics. Africanized <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> {{are about the same}} size, shape and color as <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (Fig. 2), and a genetic analysis must be used to distinguish one from the other...|$|R
50|$|Mānuka honey is {{produced}} by introduced <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (Apis mellifera) foraging on the mānuka or tea tree (Leptospermum scoparium) which grows uncultivated throughout New Zealand and southeastern Australia.|$|R
25|$|Frisch studied {{aspects of}} animal behaviour, {{including}} animal navigation, in the Carniolan honey bee (Apis mellifera carnica), a subspecies of the <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bee.</b>|$|E
25|$|The venom of an Africanized bee is {{the same}} as that of a <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bee,</b> but since the former tends to sting in far greater numbers, the number of deaths from them are {{naturally}} greater than from European honey bees. While allergies to the <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> may cause death, death and complications from African bee stings are usually not caused from allergies to their venom. Humans stung many times by the African honey bees can exhibit serious side effects such as inflammation of the skin, dizziness, headaches, weakness, edema, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Some cases even progress to affect different body systems by causing increased heart rates, respiratory distress, and even renal failure. African bee sting cases can become very serious, but they remain relatively rare and are often limited to accidental discovery in populated areas.|$|E
25|$|As the Africanized {{honeybee}} migrates further north, colonies {{continue to}} interbreed with European honeybees. In {{a study conducted}} in Arizona in 2004 {{it was observed that}} swarms of Africanized bees were capable of taking over weakened <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> hives by invading the hive, then killing the European queen and establishing their own queen. There are now relatively stable geographic zones in which either African bees dominate, a mix of African and European bees is present, or only non-African bees are found, as in the southern portions of South America or northern North America.|$|E

2500|$|The Africanized bee, {{also known}} as the Africanised <b>honey</b> <b>bee,</b> and known colloquially as [...] "killer bee", is a hybrid of the Western <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> species (Apis mellifera), {{produced}} originally by cross-breeding of the African <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> (A.m.scutellata), with various <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> such as the Italian bee A.m.ligustica and the Iberian bee A.m.iberiensis.|$|R

25|$|In {{areas of}} {{suitable}} temperate climate, the survival traits of Africanized colonies help them outperform <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> colonies. They also return later and basically work under conditions that often keep European bees hive-bound. This {{is the reason}} why they have gained a well-deserved reputation as superior honey producers, and those beekeepers who have learned to adapt their management techniques now seem to prefer them to their European counterparts. Studies show that in areas of Florida that contain Africanized honey bees, the honey production is higher than in areas in which they do not live. It is also becoming apparent that Africanized bees have another advantage over European bees in that they seem to show a higher resistance to several health issues including parasites such as Varroa destructor, some fungal diseases like chalkbrood and even the mysterious colony-collapse disorder which is currently plaguing beekeepers. So despite all its negative factors, {{it is possible that the}} Africanized honey bee might actually end up being a boon to apiculture.|$|E
25|$|Not all Africanized hives {{display the}} typical hyper-defensive behavior, which may provide bee breeders {{a point to}} begin {{breeding}} a gentler stock. Work {{has been done in}} Brazil towards this end, but in order to maintain these traits, it is necessary to develop a queen breeding and mating facility in order to requeen colonies and to prevent reintroduction of unwanted genes or characteristics through unintended cross-breeding with feral colonies. In Puerto Rico, some bee colonies are already beginning to show more gentle behavior. This is believed to be because the more gentle bees contain genetic material that is more similar to the <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> although they also contain African honey bee material. Also while bee incidents are much less common than they were during the first wave of Africanized bee colonization, this can be largely attributed to modified and improved bee management techniques. Prominent among these are locating bee-yards much further from human habitation, creating barriers to keep livestock at enough of a distance to prevent interaction, and education of the general public to teach them how to properly react when feral colonies are encountered and what resources to contact. The Africanized bee is considered the bee of choice for beekeeping in Brazil.|$|E
500|$|Bees {{are flying}} insects {{closely related to}} wasps and ants, known for their role in {{pollination}} and, {{in the case of}} the best-known bee species, the <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bee,</b> for producing honey and beeswax. Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea and are presently considered a clade, called Anthophila. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families. [...] They are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractThe {{stock of}} <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> in the {{northern}} neotropics is likely a composite of European and African lineages, but the genetic makeup of most populations in this region has remained unstudied. We analyzed the genetic composition of <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> across temperate and tropical regions of Mexico using mitochondrial and morphometric analyses. The results showed that <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> from Mexico are descendent almost in similar proportion from matrilines of African and European origins. However, morphometrics indicate that most colonies {{are the result of}} extensive introgressive hybridization with Africanized bees. While large-scale displacement of <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> seems to have occurred in the tropical regions, higher frequencies of colonies with a mixed range of African-European markers were identified in the temperate areas. Our results suggest that the outcome of the hybridization between Africanized and <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> in Mexico has been significantly associated with climate...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe studied {{resource}} use and competition by varieties of a <b>honey</b> <b>bee,</b> Apis mellifera, through re-introducing European A. m. ligustica in experimental apiaries in a habitat 'saturated' by African (or hybrid African and <b>European)</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> that naturally colonized {{forest in the}} Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Over 171 pollen species comprised <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> diets. The Morisita-Horn similarity index (highest similarity = 1. 0) between the two <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> races was 0. 76 for pollen use and, from the average daily volume usage by colonies of each bee subspecies, 0. 55 for taxon-specific intensity of use. Although using more plant species, the European bee specialized much more heavily on a few plants than did African <b>honey</b> <b>bees.</b> By re-analysis of pollen pellets collected by locally-adapted (Mexican) <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> for one year, at the same experimental sites and using the same pollen traps as our studies, {{before the arrival of}} invasive <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> in S. Mexico, we infer that resident bees may respond to exotic <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> competition by shifting flower choice and by increasing resource specialization. We also show that replicated, quantitative pollen analysis is a powerful tool that may be applied to understanding diet diversity of bees...|$|R
500|$|Banksia sessilis, {{commonly}} known as parrot bush, is a species of shrub or tree in the plant genus Banksia in the family Proteaceae. It had been known as Dryandra sessilis until 2007, when the genus Dryandra was sunk into Banksia. The Noongar peoples know the plant as Budjan or Butyak. Widespread throughout southwest Western Australia, it is found on sandy soils over laterite or limestone, often as an understorey plant in open forest, woodland or shrubland. Encountered as a shrub or small tree up to [...] in height, it has prickly dark green leaves and dome-shaped cream-yellow flowerheads. Flowering from winter through to late spring, it provides a key source of food—both the nectar and the insects it attracts—for honeyeaters in the cooler months, and species diversity is reduced in areas where {{there is little or}} no parrot bush occurring. Several species of honeyeater, some species of native bee, and the <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> seek out and consume the nectar, while the long-billed black cockatoo and Australian ringneck eat the seed. The life cycle of Banksia sessilis is adapted to regular bushfires. Killed by fire and regenerating by seed afterwards, each shrub generally produces many flowerheads and a massive amount of seed. It can recolonise disturbed areas, and may grow in thickets.|$|E
2500|$|Beekeepers in Western {{countries}} have been reporting slow declines of stocks for many years, apparently due to impaired protein production, changes in agricultural practice, or unpredictable weather. In early 2007, abnormally high die-offs (30–70% of hives) of <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> colonies occurred in North America; such a decline seems unprecedented in recent history. This has been dubbed [...] "colony collapse disorder" [...] (CCD); {{it is unclear whether}} this is simply an accelerated phase of the general decline due to stochastically more adverse conditions in 2006, or a novel phenomenon. CCD is unique {{due to the lack of}} evidence as to what causes the sudden die-off of adult worker bees, as well as few to no dead bees found around the hive.|$|E

40|$|Nuclear genetic markers in {{the form}} of random amplified {{polymorphic}} DNA (RAPD) were sought to distinguish African and <b>European</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (Apis mellifera L.). DNA amplified separately with 700 ten-base-pair primers was screened for poly-morphisms. Five primers were selected. A DNA band amplified by primer 539 is specific to the east <b>European</b> group of <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> subspecies, and bands amplified by primers 652 and 691 are African specific. Two other markers were found at high frequencies in European populations (primers 694 and 514) but at low frequencies in African populations. The east European band seen with primer 539 was found at high frequencies in New World European populations, which reflects the major contribution of the east European group of subspecies. Consistent with previous results from RFLP markers specific to east European bees, the band seen with primer 539 was absent in neotropical African bees. Intermediate frequencies of the African-specific markers (primers 652 and 691) in neotropical populations suggest some degree of hybridization, perhaps with west <b>European</b> <b>bees.</b> <b>Honey</b> <b>bee</b> queens were imported to Brazil from South Africa in 1956 with the inten-tion of interbreeding with previously im-ported European bees to improve the low honey productivity in the tropics (Kerr 1967).
