5|$|During World War II, {{more than}} 340 of the village's 1,830 {{residents}} {{served in the}} United States Armed Forces. The Hook and Ladder Company waived fees and dues for those enlisted from 1941 onward. Such {{a sufficient number of}} firefighters was serving the armed forces that the village requested volunteers ages 16–18 to join the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department; at least nine served on active duty during the war and had the ability to excuse themselves from school (which was then located adjacent to Law Memorial Park) if the fire siren went off. Also during the war, in 1944, the department received a trailer-type pump unit with a 500-gallon pump, <b>hose,</b> <b>nozzle,</b> ladders, and other tools. It was loaned to the village by the Office of Civil Defense and was an auxiliary to the existing equipment. One year later, Briarcliff High School graduate and Briarcliff Fire Company lieutenant Sgt. Arthur J. Quinn, Jr. of the 45th Division was killed in action in Germany.|$|E
60|$|I {{look out}} at the sunrise--that fateful sunrise which will shine upon an unpeopled world. The human race is gone, {{extinguished}} in a day, but the planets swing round and the tides rise or fall, and the wind whispers, and all nature goes her way, down, as it would seem, to the very amoeba, with never a sign that he who styled himself the lord of creation had ever blessed or cursed the universe with his presence. Down in the yard lies Austin with sprawling limbs, his face glimmering white in the dawn, and the <b>hose</b> <b>nozzle</b> still projecting from his dead hand. The whole of human kind is typified in that one half-ludicrous and half-pathetic figure, lying so helpless beside the machine which it used to control.|$|E

50|$|The fourth {{event is}} the hose advance. This simulates a {{firefighter}} running from a fire engine towards a close fire. The competitor sprints 140 feet {{and picks up}} a 1.75 in. diameter charged (pressurized with water) hose, sprints five more feet with the hose, then drags it an additional 75 feet. Once at the 75 ft line and through the swinging doors, the competitor must then open the <b>hose</b> <b>nozzle,</b> releasing water onto a small target. After hitting the target, they must close the nozzle and drop the hose, which completes the event. The <b>hose</b> <b>nozzle</b> may only be opened once the nozzle opens the swinging doors, if the nozzle is opened earlier a 2 second penalty is added to the final time. If the competitor does not close the nozzle, they must come back close the nozzle and then resume the final event.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{pressure}} washer {{consists of a}} motor (either electric, internal combustion, pneumatic or hydraulic) that drives a high-pressure water pump, a high-pressure hose and a trigger gun-style switch. Just as a garden <b>hose</b> <b>nozzle</b> is used to increase the velocity of water, a {{pressure washer}} creates high pressure and velocity. The pump cannot draw more water from the pipe to which the washer is connected than that source can provide: the water supply must be adequate for the machine connected to it, as water starvation leads to cavitation damage of the pump elements.|$|E

5000|$|Their {{contributions}} to the victory, however, have been considered overstated in some cases. Historians agree that Clark's Lotus-Ford was capable of winning the race handily without the added help of the Wood Brothers. In fact, the only work done on the cars was routine refueling, as they {{did not need to}} change tires during the race. Clark made only two stops all day, and the quickness of the refueling process was largely attributed to a specially-designed gravity fueling rig with a venturi tube.

City and County of San Francisco, , was {{an appeal}} from a decree that {{dismissed}} a bill {{filed by the}} appellant to restrain the infringement by the appellees of reissued letters patent granted to the appellant as the assignee of original letters patent issued to Thomas H. Bailey. The original patent was dated February 9, 1864, and the reissue September 18, 1877. They were for [...] "a new and improved valve for water cylinders of steam fire engines and other pump cylinders." [...] The specification, which was substantially the same in both patents, stated that previous to the invention therein described, the only valve used to relieve the pressure upon fire hose {{to prevent them from}} bursting was one operated by hand. To obviate the defects of such a valve, the inventor applied at some point between the engine or pump and the <b>hose</b> <b>nozzle</b> a valve which opened automatically by the pressure in the hose or the pump cylinder, so as to discharge an additional stream and thereby relieve the pressure.|$|E

40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} {{knowledge}} obtained in fi refi ghting tests using compressed air foam system (CAFS) within a confi ned space. Six experiments were conducted for verifi cation during the cooling of rooms and the self-extinguishing effect. The simulation {{was for a}} fully developed fi re within a room. The fuel was chosen to simulate ordinary combustible materials utilized in residential areas. Mantel thermocouples {{were placed in the}} rooms to record the temperature changes. Compressed air foam was fi rst applied with a standard fi re <b>hose</b> <b>nozzle</b> to the ceiling and then to the epicenter of fi re. Fire extinguishing was initiated after reaching the desired temperature in the room. The temperature for the start of fi re extinguishing matched the third phase of development of a fi re. Fire extinguishing was terminated after no obvious signs of fi re were shown in epicenter of fi re. The outputs of the experiments were evaluated {{on the basis of the}} amount of time passed for the temperature to drop below the suggested limit. Individual experiments were also conducted with various different admixing foaming agents over different locations. In the experiments, it has been verifi ed that the application of compressed air foam has a positive effect on room cooling. Use of a compressed air foaming agent does not allow for the development of steam that can scald fi refi ghters and reduce visibility. Furthermore, the extinguishing agent used is more effi cient utilizing less water fl ow out of the fi re area...|$|E
40|$|Compressed air foam fire {{suppression}} systems (CAFS) were tested to measure the potential safety risks involved with its use compared to water. CAFS are mainly used in wildland firefighting, but could {{be more effective than}} water at extinguishing fires in interior settings. The purpose of these tests was to conclude if CAFS are safe for use in structural firefighting when compared to water. The tests conducted included measuring the nozzle reaction force, force required to kink a hose, force of friction on different walking surfaces, and the time required for foam and water to separate within a pressurized segment of <b>hose.</b> <b>Nozzle</b> reaction force was measured at flow rates between 80 and 200 GPM for compressed air foam and water. At each flow rate, CAFS had a greater transient and steady reaction force than those measured for water. The force required to kink hoses filled with CAFS was significantly higher than hoses filled with water while flowing and static. On five different interior floor surfaces, the force of friction required to pull a 200 pound weighted fire boot decreased when wet with water and when covered with CAFS. The tendency for the foam structure to break down and separate within a hose was tested using a 32 foot clear PVC pipe apparatus. After being filled with compressed air foam and timing the separation of solution from water, results concluded that separation of foam occurs {{over a long period of}} time that does not pose a threat in a real life situation. The average time for homogeneous flow to re-establish after the allowed separation was 3. 6 seconds...|$|E
