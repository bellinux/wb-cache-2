5|$|As the {{inception}} of the United Nations as an intergovernmental entity slowly began formalizing in 1944, delegates from 44 of its early member states met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, now commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods conference. Delegates remained cognizant {{of the effects of the}} Great Depression, struggles to sustain the international gold standard during the 1930s, and related market instabilities. Whereas previous discourse on the international monetary system focused on fixed versus floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> Bretton Woods delegates favored pegged <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> for their flexibility. Under this system, nations would peg their <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> to the U.S. dollar, which would be convertible to gold at $35 USD per ounce. This arrangement is commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods system. Rather than maintaining fixed rates, nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar and allow their <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> to fluctuate within a 1% band of the agreed-upon parity. To meet this requirement, central banks would intervene via sales or purchases of their currencies against the dollar. Members could adjust their pegs in response to long-run fundamental disequillibria in the balance of payments, but were responsible for correcting imbalances via fiscal and monetary policy tools before resorting to repegging strategies. The adjustable pegging enabled greater exchange rate stability for commercial and financial transactions which fostered unprecedented growth in international trade and foreign investment. This feature grew from delegates' experiences in the 1930s when excessively volatile <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> and the reactive protectionist exchange controls that followed proved destructive to trade and prolonged the deflationary effects of the Great Depression. Capital mobility faced de facto limits under the system as governments instituted restrictions on capital flows and aligned their monetary policy to support their pegs.|$|E

5|$|A state {{wishing to}} devalue, {{or at least}} check the {{appreciation}} of its currency, must work within {{the constraints of the}} prevailing International monetary system. During the 1930s, countries had relatively more direct control over their <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> through the actions of their central banks.

However, a state's central bank can still intervene in the markets to effect a devaluation – if it sells its own currency to buy other currencies then this will cause the value of its own currency to fall – a practice common with states that have a managed exchange rate regime.

5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate (also referred to as forward rate or forward price) is the exchange rate at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} the forward rate for hedging purposes. The {{forward exchange}} rate is determined by a parity relationship among the spot exchange rate and differences in interest rates between two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign exchange market under which arbitrage opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the forward rate includes a premium or discount reflecting the interest rate differential. Forward <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the forward rate accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E
5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E

In particular, it stresses the key role played by monetary policy endogeneity and identifies the underlying determinants of the peso premium that are responsible for inducing a preference for the dollar in financial transactions.

The theoretical model decomposes movements in the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> into anticipated and unanticipated components. Unanticipated currency fluctuations help to determine aggregate demand through exports, imports, and the demand for domestic currency, and aggregate supply through the cost of imported intermediate goods. Anticipated <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> depreciation, through the supply channel, has limited effects on output growth and inflation. Unanticipated currency fluctuations appear more significant, with varying effects on output growth and price inflation across developing countries.

40|$|The {{weakness}} of the euro has been surprising given the widely-held expectation {{that it would be}} a strong currency. This paper critically examines explanations for the slide in the euro, finding that many are questionable on conceptual or empirical grounds. Two explanations are instead advanced that appear to be consistent both with theory and data. The first originates in the global surge in equity prices since the mid- 1990 s, which created a demand shock that disproportionately affected the U. S. economy. Model simulations indicate that this can explain the strength of the dollar against other currencies in recent years, accounting for about half of the decline in the effective value of the euro. The other component of euro weakness can be attributed to a mismatch between the demand and supply of euro-denominated assets that arose with the creation of the single currency in 1999. The effect of both these factors should fade over time, although near-term market volatility could be exacerbated by uncertainties about the fundamentals driving currency values. <b>Exchange</b> rates;exchange <b>rate,</b> real interest <b>rates,</b> inflation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements, real interest rate, aggregate demand, real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> monetary policy, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> appreciation, relative price, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> change, effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation rates, currency values, euro <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> current <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> bilateral <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> foreign currency, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> developments, foreign <b>exchange,</b> real wages, nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> real output, <b>exchange</b> markets, real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, price level, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> uncertainty, monetary economics, home currency, exchange risk, forward <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> levels, real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements, relative prices, forward <b>exchange,</b> annual <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> rational expectations, terms of trade shock, lower inflation, price elasticity, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes, real <b>rates,</b> dollar <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> terms of trade, inflation equation, inflation <b>rate,</b> real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> appreciation, currency appreciation, currency risk, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> behavior, hard ? currency, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policy...|$|R

5|$|Financial data of Lexus {{operations}} are not disclosed publicly. However, automotive analysts {{estimate that the}} Lexus division contributes {{a disproportionate share of}} Toyota's profits, relative to its limited production and sales volume. Interviews with retired division officials indicate that depending on sales volume, vehicle product development cycles, and <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> Lexus sales have accounted for as much as half of Toyota's annual U.S. profit in certain years. Division executives have employed pricing strategies aimed at sustaining profit margins rather than sales volume, with historically fewer price incentives than rival brands. In 2006, Lexus entered Interbrand's list of the Top 100 Global Brands for the first time, with an estimated brand value of approximately $3 billion annually. In 2009, Interbrand ranked Lexus as Japan's seventh largest brand, between Panasonic and Nissan, based on revenue, earnings, and market value.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{competitive}} devaluations {{have been}} rare as countries have generally preferred {{to maintain a}} high value for their currency. Countries have generally allowed market forces to work, or have participated in systems of managed exchanges rates. An exception occurred when a currency war {{broke out in the}} 1930s when countries abandoned the gold standard during the Great Depression and used currency devaluations in an attempt to stimulate their economies. Since this effectively pushes unemployment overseas, trading partners quickly retaliated with their own devaluations. The period is considered to have been an adverse situation for all concerned, as unpredictable changes in <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> reduced overall international trade.|$|E

Contrary to conventional wisdom, sterilized interventions have mattered. Consistent with conventional wisdom, coordinated interventions {{have a higher probability}} of success and move the yen-dollar rate by a larger margin than unilateral interventions. A probit model indicates that both an excessive appreciation and depreciation of the yen provoke interventions, and that interventions occur in clusters—if there is one today, there will likely be another tomorrow.

40|$|In {{exchange}} rate-based stabilization programs, credibility often {{follows a}} distinct time pattern. At first it rises as the highly visible nominal anchor provides {{a sense of}} stability and hopes run high for a permanent solution to the fiscal problems. Later, as the domestic currency appreciates in real terms and the fiscal problems are not fully resolved, {{the credibility of the}} program falls, sometimes precipitously. This paper develops a political-economy model that focuses on the evolution of credibility over time, and is consistent with the pattern just described.
