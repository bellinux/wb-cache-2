40|$|It is {{acknowledged}} that the Curzon–Ahlborn eciency ZCA determines the eciency at maximum power production of <b>heat</b> <b>engines</b> only aected by the irreversibility of finite rate <b>heat</b> transfer (endoreversible <b>engines),</b> but ZCA is not the upper bound of the eciencies of <b>heat</b> <b>engines.</b> This is conceptually dierent from {{the role of the}} Carnot eciency ZC which is indeed the upper bound of the eciencies of all <b>heat</b> <b>engines.</b> Some authors have erroneously criticized ZCA {{as if it were the}} upper bound of the eciencies of endoreversible <b>heat</b> <b>engines.</b> Although the eciencies of real <b>heat</b> <b>engines</b> cannot attain the Carnot eciency, it is possible, and often desirable, for their eciencies to be larger than their respective maximum power eciencies. In fact, the maximum power eciency is the allowable lower bound of the eciency for a given class of <b>heat</b> <b>engines.</b> These important conclusions may be expounded clearly by the theory of finite time thermodynamics. 7 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

Closed-cycle, in this context, means a thermodynamic system in which the working fluid is permanently contained within the system, and regenerative describes the use of a specific type of internal heat exchanger and thermal store, known as the regenerator.

The thermodynamic efficiency of the Hadley system, considered as a <b>heat</b> <b>engine,</b> has been relatively constant over the 1979~2010 period, averaging 2.6%. Over the same interval, the power generated by the Hadley regime has risen at an average rate of about 0.54 TW per yr; this reflects an increase in energy input to the system consistent with the observed trend in the tropical sea surface temperatures.|$|E

25|$|Maximal {{possible}} {{conversion of}} heat to work, or exergy content of heat, {{depends on the}} temperature at which heat is available and the temperature level at which the reject heat can be disposed, that is {{the temperature of the}} surrounding.

25|$|Carnot's theorem is {{a formal}} {{statement}} of this fact: No engine operating between two heat reservoirs {{can be more}} efficient than a Carnot engine operating between those same reservoirs. Thus, Equation 3 (what's equation 3-a confused reader) gives the maximum efficiency possible for any engine using the corresponding temperatures. A corollary to Carnot's theorem states that: All reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient. Rearranging {{the right side of}} the equation gives what may be a more easily understood form of the equation. Namely that the theoretical maximum efficiency of a <b>heat</b> <b>engine</b> equals the difference in temperature between the hot and cold reservoir divided by the absolute temperature of the hot reservoir. Looking at this formula an interesting fact becomes apparent; Lowering the temperature of the cold reservoir will have more effect on the ceiling efficiency of a <b>heat</b> <b>engine</b> than raising the temperature of the hot reservoir by the same amount. In the real world, this may be difficult to achieve since the cold reservoir is often an existing ambient temperature.|$|E
