The Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) occlusion-derived virus (ODV) protein P 74 {{is part of}} a complex of essential peroral <b>infectivity</b> <b>factors</b> (PIFs). Here we report that P 74 is efficiently cleaved into two fragments of about equal size by an occlusion body (OB) endogenous alkaline protease during ODV release when AcMNPV OBs are derived from larvae. The cleavage is specific for P 74, since the other known peroral <b>infectivity</b> <b>factors</b> in the same complex (PIF 1, PIF 2, and PIF 3) were not cleaved under the same conditions. P 74 cleavage was not observed in OBs produced in three different insect cell lines, suggesting a larval host origin of the responsible protease. P 74 in OBs produced in larvae of two different host species was cleaved into fragments with the same apparent molecular mass, indicating that the virus incorporates a similar alkaline protease from different hosts. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the two P 74 subunit fragments remain associated with the recently discovered PIF complex. We propose that under in vivo ODV infection conditions, P 74 undergoes two sequential cleavage events, the first one being performed by an ODV-associated host alkaline protease and the second carried out by trypsin in the host midgut...|$|R

30|$|Baculoviruses are {{characterized}} by rod-shaped enveloped virions and a circular, dsDNA genome of 80 – 180 kbp. The family Baculoviridae is also defined by 37 core genes that are conserved in all baculovirus genomes [51]. This set of core genes provides {{a picture of the}} common elements required for functional baculoviruses including virion structure, novel polymerases required for virus-specific-DNA replication and gene transcription, and per oral <b>infectivity</b> <b>factors</b> that are essential for infection of insect midgut cells [50]. Their host range is restricted to arthropods and most particularly to insects [50]. Thus baculoviruses are considered to be very safe options for insect pest control. These viruses are infectious orally and the occlusion-derived virions (ODV) infect midgut epithelial cells after ingestion and dissolution of the OB in the alkaline condition of the midgut. Typically, two virion phenotypes occur in baculovirus infections, ODV and budded virions (BV) that spread the infection to tissues throughout the host. Thus the ODV are responsible for horizontal transmission between insect hosts and BV for systemic spread of infection within a host.|$|R

50|$|Viral <b>infectivity</b> <b>factor,</b> or Vif, is {{a protein}} found in HIV and other retroviruses. Its {{role is to}} disrupt the {{antiviral}} activity of the human enzyme APOBEC (See also APOBEC3G) by targeting it for ubiquitination and cellular degradation. APOBEC is a cytidine deaminase enzyme that mutates viral nucleic acids.Vif is a 23-kilodalton protein that is essential for viral replication. Vif inhibits the cellular protein, APOBEC3G, from entering the virion during budding from a host cell by targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Vif hijacks the cellular Cullin5 E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is composed of ElonginB, ElonginC, Cullin5, and Rbx2, (Crystal Structure of the HIV Vif BC-box in Complex with Human ElonginB and ElonginC is solved and shown here) in order to target APOBEC3G for degradation. In the absence of Vif, APOBEC3G causes hypermutation of the viral genome, rendering it dead-on-arrival at the next host cell. APOBEC3G is thus a host defence to retroviral infection which HIV-1 has overcome by the acquisition of Vif. Targeting Vif has been suggested as a strategy for future HIV drug therapies.|$|E

Other accessory genes include vif (viral <b>infectivity</b> <b>factor),</b> tat (transcription activator), and rev (protein expression regulator). In primate lentiviruses there is usually an ORF for nef (negative factor); this is not present in BIV. BIV has a structure like all retroviruses, and contains two copies of its positive sense single stranded RNA genome. It has two compartments: the envelope and the core. The envelope comes from the host cell plasma membrane, the virus takes the membrane as it buds and then inserts viral glycoproteins into its envelope. The {{core of the virus}} contains Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins. These polyproteins are cleaved in the mature virus to their functional forms.|$|E

However nothing {{is known about}} the ability of Culicoides midges to interfere with the infectivity of the viruses they transmit. Among these, Bluetongue Virus (BTV) induces a hemorrhagic fever- type disease and its recent emergence in Europe had a major economical impact. We observed that needle inoculation of BTV 8 in the site of uninfected C. nubeculosus feeding reduced viraemia and clinical disease intensity compared to plain needle inoculation. The sheep that developed the highest local inflammatory reaction had the lowest viral load, suggesting that the inflammatory response to midge bites may participate in the individual sensitivity to BTV viraemia development. Conversely compared to needle inoculation, inoculation of BTV 8 by infected C. nubeculosus bites promoted viraemia and clinical symptom expression, in association with delayed IFN- induced gene expression and retarded neutralizing antibody responses. The effects of uninfected and infected midge bites on BTV viraemia and on the host response indicate that BTV transmission by infected midges is the most reliable experimental method to study the physio-pathological events relevant to a natural infection and to pertinent vaccine evaluation in the target species.

40|$|The {{measles virus}} (MV) P gene codes for three proteins: P, an {{essential}} polymerase cofactor, and V and C, which have multiple functions {{but are not}} strictly required for viral propagation in cultured cells. V shares the amino-terminal domain with P but has a zinc-binding carboxyl-terminal domain, whereas C is translated from an overlapping reading frame. During replication, the P protein binds incoming monomeric nucleocapsid (N) proteins with its amino-terminal domain and positions them for assembly into the nascent ribonucleocapsid. The P protein amino-terminal domain is natively unfolded; to probe its conformational flexibility, we fused it to the green fluorescent protein (GFP), thereby also silencing C protein expression. A recombinant virus (MV-GFP/P) expressing hybrid GFP/P and GFP/V proteins in place of standard P and V proteins and not expressing the C protein was rescued and produced normal ratios of mono-, bi-, and tricistronic RNAs, but its replication was slower {{than that of the}} parental virus. Thus, the P protein retained nearly intact polymerase cofactor function, even with a large domain added to its amino terminus. Having noted that titers of cell-associated and especially released MV-GFP/P were reduced and knowing that the C protein of the related Sendai virus has particle assembly and <b>infectivity</b> <b>factor</b> functions, we produced an MV-GFP/P derivative expressing C.

40|$|Insect larvae are orally {{infected}} by baculoviruses through ingestion of proteinaceous occlusion bodies (OB) containing the so-called occlusion derived viruses (ODV). OBs disintegrate in the alkaline {{environment of the}} insect midgut releasing the ODV, which then bind and fuse with the microvillar membrane of epithelial cells thereby initiating infection. After replication and spread through the larval body, ODVs are assembled and occluded into OBs. In this thesis the protein structure of ODVs and their entry into microvillar cells were studied {{from the perspective of}} protein-protein interactions. A number a novel interactions were identified among ODV structural proteins shedding light on the spatial and temporal mechanism of ODV assembly. Furthermore, a group of highly conserved viral per os <b>infectivity</b> <b>factors</b> (PIF) was shown to form a complex on the ODV envelope. These PIF proteins are essential for oral infectivity of ODVs and the complex may play a pivotal role in binding and fusion of ODV with the microvillar membrane. It was further found that in the OB structure a host derived alkaline protease was tightly associated with ODVs and cleaved one of the PIF proteins (P 74). Proteolytic processing of PIF proteins may be necessary to trigger conformational changes in the complex to facilitate its function in binding and fusion with the host cell membrane. This thesis provided not only novel insights on the mechanism of ODV entry and assembly and the role of individual ODV proteins, but also triggered new questions to direct future investigations.  ...|$|R

Here we show that Ac 115 also is a PIF (PIF 3) and that, unlike PIF 1 and PIF 2, it does not mediate specific binding of AcMNPV occlusion-derived virus (ODV) to midgut target cells. We used an improved in vivo fluorescence dequenching assay to compare binding, fusion, and competition among control AcMNPV ODV and the ODVs of AcMNPV PIF 1, PIF 2, and PIF 3 deletion mutants. Our results showed that binding and fusion of PIF 1 and PIF 2 mutants, but not the PIF 3 mutant, were both qualitatively and quantitatively {{different from those of}} control ODV. Unlike control and PIF 3 -deficient ODV, an excess of PIF 1 - or PIF 2 -deficient ODV failed to compete effectively with control ODV's binding to specific receptors on midgut epithelial cells. Moreover, the levels of PIF 1 - and PIF 2 -deficient ODV binding were depressed threefold compared to control levels. Binding, fusion, and competition by PIF 3 -deficient ODV, however, were all indistinguishable from those of control ODV.

In this study, we investigated the host specificities of the four core components of the PIF complex, P 74, PIF 1, PIF 2 and PIF 3 by using Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV) backbone.

Transfection and infection assays showed that all the recombinant viruses were able to produce infectious budded viruses (BVs) and were lethal to H. armigera larvae via intrahaemocoelic injection.

The ODV membrane proteins play crucial roles in mediating virus entry into midgut epithelium cells to initiate infection and are important factors in host range determination. For Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), seven conserved ODV membrane proteins {{have been shown to be}} essential for oral infectivity and are called per os <b>infectivity</b> <b>factors</b> (PIFs).

The GpSGHV genome is a double-stranded circular DNA molecule of 190, 032 bp containing 160 nonoverlapping open reading frames (ORFs), which are distributed equally on both strands with a gene density of one per 1. 2 kb. It has a high A+T content of 72 %. About 3 % of the GpSGHV genome is composed of 15 sequence repeats, distributed throughout the genome. Although sharing the same morphological features (enveloped rod-shaped nucleocapsid) as baculoviruses, nudiviruses, and nimaviruses, analysis of its genome revealed that GpSGHV differs significantly from these viruses {{at the level of}} its genes. Sequence comparisons indicated that only 23 % of GpSGHV genes displayed moderate homologies to genes from other invertebrate viruses, principally baculoviruses and entomopoxviruses.

MethodsA total of 205 children diagnosed with T 1 DM who routinely attended the Diabetic Centre (DC) of Aseer Central Hospital (ACH) in Abha KSA were randomly selected. Another control group of 51 non-diabetic children were also selected. Sera of both groups were tested for HCMV-specific IgG and IgM using an indirect enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA). ResultsThe recorded HCMV-IgG seroprevalence rates {{were found to be}} higher in both groups of children than the IgM responses, which were consistently low. There were no obvious {{differences between the two groups}} in terms of HCMV responses. No significant variations were observed between girls and boys in terms of the seroprevalence rates. The highest positive IgG prevalence rates to HCMV were observed among 11 - to 15 -year-old children, and the least positive rates were noted in children younger than 5 years of age. Children from Abha city and its vicinity showed relatively higher HCMV-specific IgG and IgM responses rates than children from other localities. ConclusionsDespite the presence of high HCMV-IgG response rates among the studied group of children, this study could not identify the associated clinical manifestations.

Three of these proteins, P 74, PIF 1, and PIF 2, were thought to function in virus binding to insect midgut cells. In this paper evidence is provided that PIF 1, PIF 2, and PIF 3 form a stable complex on the surface of ODV particles of the baculovirus Autographa californica multinucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV). The complex could withstand 2 % SDS- 5 % ß-mercaptoethanol with heating at 50 °C for 5 min. The complex was not formed when any of the genes for PIF 1, PIF 2, or PIF 3 was deleted, while reinsertion of these genes into AcMNPV restored the complex. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis independently confirmed the interactions of the three PIF proteins and revealed in addition that P 74 is also associated with this complex. However, deletion of the p 74 gene did not affect formation of the PIF 1 -PIF 2 -PIF 3 complex.

Subsequent animal studies showed that the mutant failed to establish an infection in mice, highlighting that CsrABb is required for the infectivity of B. burgdorferi. Western blot analyses revealed that the virulence-associated factors OspC, DbpB, and DbpA were attenuated in the csrABb mutant. The Rrp 2 -RpoN-RpoS pathway (54 -S sigma factor cascade) is a central regulon that governs the expression of ospC, dbpB, and dbpA.

In {{order to understand the}} ODV entry mechanism, the identification of all components of the PIF complex is crucial. Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} identify additional components of the PIF complex. Coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) combined with proteomic analysis was used to identify the components of the Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) PIF complex. PIF 4 and P 95 (AC 83) were identified as components of the PIF complex while PIF 5 was not, and this was confirmed with blue native PAGE and a second CoIP. Deletion of the pif 4 gene impaired complex formation, but deletion of pif 5 did not. Differentially denaturing SDS-PAGE further revealed that PIF 4 forms a stable complex with PIF 1, PIF 2, and PIF 3. P 95 and P 74 are more loosely associated with this complex. Three other proteins, AC 5, AC 68, and AC 108 (homologue of SF 58), were also found by the proteomic analysis to be associated with the PIF complex. Finally the functional significance of the PIF protein interactions is discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAPOBEC 3 G {{is a human}} {{cellular}} {{enzyme that}} is incorporated into retroviral particles and acts to restrict retroviral replication in infected cells by deaminating dC to dU in the first (minus) -strand cDNA replication intermediate [1 – 5]. HIV, however, encodes a protein (virion <b>infectivity</b> <b>factor,</b> Vif [6, 7]), which overcomes APOBEC 3 G-mediated restriction but by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that Vif triggers APOBEC 3 G degradation by a proteasome-dependent pathway and that an 80 amino acid region of APOBEC 3 G surrounding its first zinc coordination motif is sufficient to confer the ability to partake in an interaction involving Vif. Inhibitors of this interaction might therefore prove therapeutically useful in blocking Vif-mediated APOBEC 3 G destruction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCEM 15 /APOBEC 3 G is a {{cellular}} protein required for resistance to infection by virion <b>infectivity</b> <b>factor</b> (Vif) -deficient {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV). Here, using a murine leukemia virus (MLV) -based system, we provide evidence that CEM 15 /APOBEC 3 G is a DNA deaminase that is incorporated into virions during viral production and subsequently triggers massive deamination of deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine within the retroviral minus (first) -strand cDNA, thus providing a probable trigger for viral destruction. Furthermore, HIV Vif can protect MLV from this CEM 15 /APOBEC 3 G-dependent restriction. These findings imply that targeted DNA deamination is a major strategy of innate immunity to retroviruses and likely also contributes to the sequence variation observed in many viruses (including HIV) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe HIV- 1 virion <b>infectivity</b> <b>factor</b> (Vif) is {{required}} during viral replication to inactivate the host cell anti-viral factor, APOBEC 3 G (A 3 G). Vif binds A 3 G and a Cullin 5 -ElonginBC E 3 ubiquitin ligase complex {{which results in}} the proteasomal degradation of A 3 G. The Vif PPLP motif (amino acids 161 – 164) is essential for normal Vif function because mutations in this motif reduce the infectivity of virions produced in T-cells. In this report, we demonstrate that mutation of the Vif PPLP motif reduces Vif binding to A 3 G without affecting its interaction with ElonginC and Cullin 5. We demonstrate that {{the failure of the}} Vif mutant to bind A 3 G resulted in A 3 G incorporation into assembling virions with loss of viral infectivity...|$|E
40|$|Baculovirus occlusion-derived virus (ODV) initiates {{infection}} of lepidopteran larval hosts by binding to the midgut epithelia, which is mediated by per os <b>infectivity</b> <b>factors</b> (PIFs). Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) encodes seven PIF proteins, of which PIF 1 to PIF 4 form a core complex in ODV envelopes to which PIF 0 and PIF 6 loosely associate. Deletion of any pif gene results in ODV {{being unable to}} bind or enter midgut cells. AC 83 also associates with the PIF complex, and this study further analyzed its role in oral infectivity to determine {{if it is a}} PIF protein. It had been proposed that AC 83 possesses a chitin binding domain that enables transit through the peritrophic matrix; however, no chitin binding activity has ever been demonstrated. AC 83 has been reported to be found only in the ODV envelopes, but in contrast, the Orgyia pseudotsugata MNPV AC 83 homolog is associated with both ODV nucleocapsids and envelopes. In addition, unlike known pif genes, deletion of ac 83 eliminates nucleocapsid formation. We propose a new model for AC 83 function and show AC 83 is associated with both ODV nucleocapsids and envelopes. We also further define the domain required for nucleocapsid assembly. The cysteine-rich region of AC 83 is also shown not to be a chitin binding domain but a zinc finger domain required for the recruitment or assembly of the PIF complex to ODV envelopes. As such, AC 83 has all the properties of a PIF protein and should be considered PIF 8. In addition, pif 7 (ac 110) is reported as the 38 th baculovirus core gene. </p...|$|R
40|$|Baculoviruses orally infect {{caterpillars}} in {{the form}} of occlusion-derived viruses (ODVs). The ODV-envelope contains a number of proteins which are essential for oral infectivity, called per os <b>infectivity</b> <b>factors</b> (PIFs). Most of these PIFs are involved {{in the form}}ation of an ODV-entry complex that consists of a stable core, formed by PIF 1, PIF 2, PIF 3 and PIF 4, and the more loosely associated PIFs P 74 (PIF 0) and P 95 (PIF 8). PIF 1, PIF 2 and PIF 3 are essential for formation of the stable core, whereas deletion of the pif 4 gene results in the formation of a smaller complex. P 74 is not needed for formation of the stable core. We show here in larva-derived ODVs of the Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus that PIF-proteins are degraded by host-derived proteases after deletion of a single pif-gene. Constituents of the stable core-complex appeared to be more resistant to proteases as part of the complex than as monomer, as in ODVs of a p 74 deletion mutant only the stable core was found but no PIF monomers. When the stable core lacks PIF 4, it lost its proteolytic resistance as the resulting smaller core complex was degraded in a pif 4 deletion mutant. We also identified PIF 6 as a loosely associated component of the entry complex that appeared nevertheless important for the proteolytic resistance of the stable core, which was degraded after deletion of pif 6. We conclude from these results that an intact entry-complex in the ODV-envelope is prerequisite for proteolytic resistance of PIF-proteins under the alkaline conditions of the larval midgut...|$|R
40|$|Glossina pallidipes {{salivary gland}} {{hypertrophy}} virus (GpSGHV; family Hytrosaviridae) can establish asymptomatic and symptomatic infection in its tsetse fly host. Here, {{we present a}} comprehensive annotation of the genome of an Ethiopian GpSGHV isolate (GpSGHV-Eth) compared with the reference Ugandan GpSGHV isolate (GpSGHV-Uga; GenBank accession number EF 568108). GpSGHV-Eth has higher salivary gland hypertrophy syndrome prevalence than GpSGHV-Uga. We show that the GpSGHV-Eth genome has 190 291 nt, a low G+C content (27. 9 %) and encodes 174 putative ORFs. Using proteogenomic and transcriptome mapping, 141 and 86 ORFs were mapped by transcripts and peptides, respectively. Furthermore, of the 174 ORFs, 132 had putative transcriptional signals [TATA-like box and poly(A) signals]. Sixty ORFs had both TATA-like box promoter and poly(A) signals, and mapped by both transcripts and peptides, implying that these ORFs encode functional proteins. Of the 60 ORFs, 10 ORFs are homologues to baculovirus and nudivirus core genes, including three per os <b>infectivity</b> <b>factors</b> and four RNA polymerase subunits (LEF 4, 5, 8 and 9). Whereas GpSGHV-Eth and GpSGHV-Uga are 98. 1 % similar at the nucleotide level, 37 ORFs in the GpSGHV-Eth genome had nucleotide insertions (n 517) and deletions (n 520) compared with their homologues in GpSGHV-Uga. Furthermore, compared with the GpSGHV-Uga genome, 11 and 24 GpSGHV ORFs were deleted and novel, respectively. Further, 13 GpSGHV-Eth ORFs were non-canonical; they had either CTG or TTG start codons instead of ATG. Taken together, {{these data suggest that}} GpSGHV-Eth and GpSGHV-Uga represent two different lineages of the same virus. Genetic differences combined with host and environmental factors possibly explain the differential GpSGHV pathogenesis observed in different G. pallidipes colonies...|$|R
