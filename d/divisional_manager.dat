Toyota’s global chief engineer Tetsuya Tada saw a quarter scale clay {{model of the}} car {{during a trip to}} the Australian branch in 2014 and arranged for a full scale, fully function version to be built in Japan by Toyota's Takumi ("artisan") craftsmen. Tada said, “while we never say never, and I would love this concept to become a production reality, it is very much a concept that demonstrates the passion within Toyota for cars that are fun to drive". Commenting on the new car, Toyota's Australian <b>Divisional</b> <b>Manager</b> National Marketing Brad Cramb said: ”The Toyota 86 lends itself perfectly to a concept that expands its appeal with added versatility while retaining its sleek and sporty coupe styling and sharp, responsive driving character”.|$|E
40|$|Using hand-collected data on <b>divisional</b> <b>managers</b> at S&P 1500 firms, {{we study}} how changes in one <b>divisional</b> <b>manager’s</b> {{compensation}} affect the compensation of other <b>divisional</b> <b>managers</b> inside the same conglomerate. An increase in a manager’s pay {{driven by an}} industry shock generates large positive intra-firm spillovers on the pay of other <b>divisional</b> <b>managers.</b> These spillovers operate only within firm boundaries and are non-existent for the same industry pairs in standalone firms. The intra-firm spillovers are stronger when managers share social networks, suggesting that informal interactions facilitate peer effects. The intra-firm convergence in executive pay is associated with weaker governance and lower firm value. Overall, we provide evidence on corporate socialism in executive pay...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the transfer of resources within an organization. It is assumed that top level management wish to allocate scarce corporate resources as effectively as possible. However, top level management do not have enough information to fully assess the potential return from deployment of resources, in particular divisions of the corporation. Hence, top level management require <b>divisional</b> <b>managers</b> who hold such information to communicate it. Any resultant allocation of corporate resources will clearly affect the profit attained by a division. In addition, it is assumed <b>divisional</b> <b>managers</b> will be compensated partly on the basis of divisional profit, in order to promote higher levels of divisional management effort provision. The inter-relationship between the allocation of corporate resources and divisional management's resultant compensation, leads to an incentive problem. <b>Divisional</b> <b>managers</b> will perceive advantages from communicating information to top level management about the division's potential returns in a strategic (untruthful) fashion in order to improve their compensation. In this thesis it is argued that opportunities for misrepresentation should be controlled. The major result of the thesis is to propose a method for allocating scarce corporate resources and compensating <b>divisional</b> <b>managers,</b> that induces them to tell the truth and provide appropriate levels of managerial effort...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we explain the {{apparent}} "diversification discount" of conglomerates without assuming inefficient-cross subsidisation through internal capital markets. Instead {{we assume that}} an internal capital market efficiently redistributes scare resources across a conglomerate's divisions between successive production periods. The need for redistribtion arises {{from the fact that}} resources may sometimes be produced by divisions which happen to be successful in an earlier production stage but which do not have the best investment opportunities in future production stages. In contrast to the existing literature we consider explicitly the incentive problem between corporate headquarter and <b>divisional</b> <b>managers</b> using a standard Moral-Hazard framework. We show that although a complete incentive contract can be written bi-laterally between headquarter and <b>divisional</b> <b>managers,</b> the redistribution of resources across divisions creates additional agency costs in a conglomerate. Moreover, assuming that no complete contract can govern the interim redistribution policy by the headquarter, we show how the agency problem with <b>divisional</b> <b>managers</b> constrains headquarters interim redistribtion to be ex ante inefficient...|$|R
500|$|The book recounts how Erhard's {{childhood}} events, job {{positions and}} self-education {{lead to the}} development of the est training. Born Jack Rosenberg, Erhard was an inquisitive child who was close to his mother. In his student years, he read profusely and earned superior grades. As a teenager, Eerhard experienced both conflicts with his mother and a growing dissatisfaction with his life. Shortly after graduating from high school he married his girlfriend Pat Campbell, who had become pregnant. Instead of pursuing his plans for higher education, he took on a variety of jobs including meat-packing, heating and plumbing, estimating and selling cars. [...] By the age of 21, Erhard had become the top car salesman at the dealership he worked for. By the time he was 25, Erhard and his wife had four children and he was feeling increasingly restless and constrained. He formed a friendship with a woman named June Bryde, which gradually deepened into an affair. He secretly arranged a flight from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with June in 1960, leaving behind his wife and their four children, who would not hear from him for twelve years. The couple settled for a time in St Louis, and it was at this time that he changed his name to Werner Erhard with June changing hers to Ellen Erhard. After more work in car sales, Erhard joined the sales staff of Parents Magazine and was rapidly promoted to training manager and eventually appointed Vice-President in 1967. During this period Erhard moved frequently to different parts of the US as dictated by the demands of the job, finally settling in San Francisco. When Parents Magazine was sold to the Time-Life group, he was recruited by the Grolier Society as <b>Divisional</b> <b>Manager.</b> According to Grolier vice-president John Wirtz the intention of appointing Erhard was that he would bring “integrity, honesty and straightforwardness” to their sales practices.|$|E

40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} in which corporate spinoffs are {{a feature of}} incentive contracts for product managers in diversified firms. I argue {{that the possibility of}} a future spinoff can improve current incentives for <b>divisional</b> <b>managers,</b> even if a spinoff rarely actually occurs. Spinoff incentive policies exploit the fact that after a spinoff, the stock value of the product line is a much cleaner signal of managerial productivity than when the division belongs to the parent firm. I show that providing current incentives through such a reorganization policy can dominate standard principal-agent contracts in highly diversified firms. Empirical implications of the model are developed regarding corporate spinoff behavior and the compensation of <b>divisional</b> <b>managers.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Increasing divisional {{operational}} responsibilities and the dispersal of knowledge creating activities within the firm have loosened the traditional hierarchical structure of multi−divisional firms. In this paper {{we argue that}} a similar mixture of competition and cooperation that is found in inter−firm relationships now characterizes intra−firm relationships. Our model describes {{a situation in which}} <b>divisional</b> <b>managers</b> have their own objectives that may diverge from those of the firm as a whole. Thus, <b>divisional</b> <b>managers</b> are both profit−seekers in creating value that can be appropriated and rent−seekers in attempting to maximize their divisional share of the value created by the firm. The bargaining power of a division to maintain and increase its share of the profits generated by the operations of the firm as whole is crucially determined on its strategic independence...|$|R

30|$|The {{consequence}} of establishing profit centers evaluated based upon local accounting profit {{is that the}} <b>divisional</b> <b>managers</b> act strategically. That is the expectation. In the coordination game, the <b>divisional</b> <b>managers</b> have private information and with only the internal market they act as monopolists. That means that they will attempt {{to get the information}} rents which is associated with their private information. The firm might want to counter that by inducing cooperative behavior in the organization and one {{way to do that is}} to replace the focus on the local profit with a focus on the global profit. This is done in a form consistent with the principle of controllable performance as it is constructed as the sum of the local profit and the planned profit for the remaining divisions. However, coordination is only an induced incentive problem. If there is no fundamental goal conflict, a weight of zero will make the strategic behavior disappear. The fundamental incentive problem is buried in the conflicting goals of central and decentral management. That is modeled as the effort variable at the simplest level.|$|R
