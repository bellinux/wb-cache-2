50|$|The law {{explains}} the process: {{the filing of}} a notice of contest by the loser of the election, the taking of testimony from witnesses, and the <b>holding</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearings</b> on the depositions and papers filed with the Clerk of the House.

An examination of a contested election may also be initiated by any member on the floor who wishes to challenge the legitimacy of another member's taking of the oath of office.

In a very recent case, Marine Space Enclosures, Inc. v.

Specifically, the court considered the question of when a hearing must be held in certain cases before the Federal Maritime Commission and what type of hearing suffices in law. The importance of these issues generally, and particularly to the Federal Maritime Commission, indicates that an analysis of the issues considered by the court is needed at this time...|$|E
40|$|African Studies Seminar series. Paper {{presented}} 11 May, 1998 The South African Truth Commission {{has three}} Committees — one on Human Rights Violations, one on Amnesty {{and one on}} Reparation and Rehabilitation. Together they are, {{in the words of}} the Commission itself, designed to 'reveal the truth about the political conflicts of the past. 1 Their ultimate aim is to develop a 'culture of human rights in our country, so that the suffering and injustices of the past never occur again. '. This paper examines the operation of one of these committees, that on Human Rights Violations in Alexandra township. Alex was the home of many of South Africa's political leaders during the struggle against apartheid. It was a place where intense political and social conflicts occurred throughout the period covered by the Commission (1960 - 1993), peaking in a strikingly focused period of rebellion in the mid 1980 s. The Truth Commission has taken thousands of statements from victims of apartheid, hundreds of them residents in the townships of Johannesburg. People were asked to come forward if they or their kin had been killed, abducted, tortured or severely ill treated for political reasons. The commission defined such experiences as gross human rights violations. It undertook to investigate them through its Investigative Unit. It aimed to find out who was responsible for these, how and why they happened; and to hold public hearings. The Committee on Reparation and Rehabilitation would receive the information thus derived, consult with 'communities' and make policy recommendations to the President for appropriate reparation to victims. This paper is concerned with only one of these activities, the <b>holding</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearings</b> throughout the country, at which victims could speak out and be heard and seen by the public of their own communities. Many hearings were recorded for television, but usually only brief extracts were shown. The paper explores one of these hearings in more detail. Of the many who had been victims of apartheid in the township of Alexandra, 22 were invited to present their testimonies concerning resistance in the township between the 1960 s and late 1980 s. I attended two of the three days during which the commission sat in Alexandra and heard these 22 testimonies. Listening to the testimonies presented, many of them by people not well known outside Alexandra itself — the classic subjects of oral histories- led me to realise that the public hearings were unique. They involved entirely different processes from the taking of oral histories of the period and they were quite unlike court cases as well. The commission has chosen to use the method of ritual rather than that of law to carry out its purpose. This paper explores this procedure, using the case of one relatively small but extremely significant part of the country as its lens...|$|E

40|$|Brazil's {{environmental}} impact assessment system is not yet capable of coping with the challenge presented by the pluri-annual plans {{that have been the}} means of organizing government priorities since 1996. It is hoped that this challenge results in strengthening of the system.

40|$|While Congressional {{scholars}} {{agree that}} hearings {{are an important}} activity there is little consensus on {{their role in the}} legislative process. The traditional literature on hearings pplays down their role as mechanisms of disseminating information because committee members often do not appear persuaded by the information they reveal.

We show that, if hearings have some intrinsic informative content and are costly, even extreme committees can transmit useful information to the floor. Furthermore, the possibility <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> <b>hearings</b> creates an incentive for extreme committees to specialize and reveal information simply by the decision whether to hold hearings. ...|$|R

USMS and FBI agents were armed with M16s and sniper rifles, and they used an armored personnel carrier. It resulted in the deaths of two Weaver's son Sammy, his wife Vicki, and Deputy U.S. Marshal William Francis Degan. At the subsequent federal criminal trial of Weaver and Harris, Weaver's attorney Gerry Spence made accusations of [...] "criminal wrongdoing" [...] against every agency involved in the incident: the FBI, USMS, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE), and the United States Attorney's Office (USAO) for Idaho.
