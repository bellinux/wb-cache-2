Moreover, we show that the composition of several correct abstract implementations is always correct.

No human being - and certainly not the present writer - has the exhaustive knowledge of the several mediators or the requisite criteria for making such a judgment.

50|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Board President Jeffry Pesek and Superintendent Michael Kuzniewski, Morton High School District 201 has drastically expanded learning opportunities. Morton continues to enhance the many activities that support students’ learning such as Tapestry, Credit Recovery Program, and the Freshmen Mentoring Program. Several support programs such as Coaching Centers, Student Intervention Teams, and the Technology Support Internship make the education process a seamless one. Morton High School District 201 released a new grading system in 2014, which ensures that all parties are {{held accountable for the}} academic success of students and allows teachers to hold students to the highest standards.District 201 actively engages parents and community members. The district actively supports the Parent Teacher Organization and Parent Teacher Association, which helps with several community events throughout the school year, including coordinating a series of annual anti-bullying events. Parent liaisons at all campuses get parents involved in school and community events and hold monthly principal meetings to receive community feedback. Throughout the year counselors host a series of college nights explaining the college application and financial aid process to parents.District 201 has worked to provide safe and well maintained schools to enhance learning for all students. In 2014, the main school entrances were remodeled to provide control of all individuals entering school grounds. Also in 2014, the Board of Education inaugurated the new Morton Stadium which includes a new field, concession stand, and an 8 lane track, among several facility upgrades. In 2014, District 201 upgraded the Morton West pool room lighting with energy efficient lights and updated the ceiling, windows and paint. The Morton West cafeteria was also renovated and expanded over the summer of 2014. In 2014 the old Morton East pool was finally renovated into an expanded classroom. In 2015, six chemistry labs in Morton East and West will be renovated. Renovations are expected for the culinary arts room as well. The 1:1 program was officially launched in 2014. In 2014 all incoming freshmen were given a Dell lap top device. District 201 will continue roll out the distribution and use of laptops for all incoming freshmen classes. In 2014 a new interactive white board was installed in all classrooms throughout the district to support the 1:1 program. District 201 continues to improve district-wide technology infrastructure with an increase to district wide bandwidth. This increase in bandwidth allows students {{to take advantage of the}} 1:1 program. In 2014 District 201 had its 5th consecutive balanced budget. On this same year, District 201 also received the Association of School Business Officials International's (ASBO) Certificate of Excellence in Financial Reporting Award for having met or exceeded the program's high standards for financial reporting and accountability. The district was recognized for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ending 2013.

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} the {{difference}} in the quality of earnings between publicly-owned public corporations and publicly-owned private companies in terms of relevance and <b>fair</b> <b>presentation.</b> According to IASB 2010 the fundamental qualitative characteristics of financial information are relevance and <b>fair</b> <b>presentation.</b> Relevance includes earnings persistence and earnings predictability, while <b>fair</b> <b>presentation</b> includes {{the presence or absence of}} earnings management. This research is done by document method that is collecting data directly from financial report of companies that reported. Earnings persistence is measured by regression analysis of net income, and earnings management is measured by earnings variability divided by operating cash flow variability. The results showed that there was a significant difference in the quality of earnings on the side of relevance. The government has several public companies with persistent value, while the private sector does not have a firm with persistent value. In terms of earnings management, there is no meaningful difference. Only a slight difference is where there is an indication of earnings smoothing...|$|E

30|$|A true and <b>fair</b> <b>presentation</b> of the {{situation}} is the standard against which all accounting practices have to be assessed. Any practice that would depart from this standard belongs in the category of creative accounting. Creative accounting is ‘the transformation of financial accounting figures from what they actually are to what preparers desire by taking advantage of the existing rules and/or ignoring some or all of them’ (Naser 1993, p. 2). As emphasised by Jones (2011), creative accounting is not necessarily a synonym of fraudulent action. Indeed, ‘managers will be happy to use creative accounting as they will be keeping to the letter, if not the spirit, of the law’ (p. 38). Actually, there exists a grey area between accounts that offer a <b>fair</b> <b>presentation</b> and those that are fraudulent. Within this grey area, accounts are managed in compliance with the rule of law. However, they do no longer offer a <b>fair</b> <b>presentation</b> of {{the situation}}. When accounts are managed, the apparent performance is modified (Stolowy and Breton 2004, p. 7 – 11). Subsequently, it becomes more difficult for stakeholders, and especially the legislature, to understand the government’s real fiscal performance or position and to take efficient decisions.|$|E

40|$|The interim {{financial}} information of a company, {{published in the}} form of an interim report, provides the users of company reports with timely information for making economic decisions. The preparation and presentation of interim reports in the Republic of South Africa has been regulated for a number of decades by the Companies Act, No 61 of 1973, and the JSE Listing Requirements, which regulate the minimum disclosure requirements for interim reports. There is a general requirement in section 303 of the Companies Act that the interim report should be a <b>fair</b> <b>presentation</b> of the business, results and operations of the company - no guidance is however provided as to what <b>fair</b> <b>presentation</b> implies. Until recently, there were substantial uncertainties regarding which principles should apply in respect of the preparation of, and disclosure in interim reports to ensure that the interim report provides a <b>fair</b> <b>presentation</b> of the entity's financial position, results and changes in financial position. The recent release of international and local standards has given momentum to the process of improving the quality of interim reports. The main objective of the paper is to provide information pertaining to the extent to which South African listed companies (1) adhere to the local relevant statutory and regulatory disclosure requirements regarding interim financial reports and (2) already adhere to international and local accounting standards which become operative for financial statements covering periods beginning on or after 1 January 1999...|$|E

In 1882 he embarked upon a world trip, and after visiting London, arrived in Melbourne, where he took an illustrating job with the satirical magazine Australian Tit-Bits; later incorporated into Melbourne Life with Bradley as editor and cartoonist. In 1888 he became chief cartoonist of the Melbourne Punch after the retirement of artist Tom Carrington, and was at the Punch until 1893, with notable coverage of the Australian labor movement.
