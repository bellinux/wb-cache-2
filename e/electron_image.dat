2500|$|Measurement of {{the energy}} of photons emitted from the {{specimen}} is a common method to get analytical capabilities. Examples are the Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detectors used in elemental analysis and Cathodoluminescence microscope (CL) systems that analyse the intensity and spectrum of electron-induced luminescence in (for example) geological specimens. [...] In SEM systems using these detectors {{it is common to}} color code these extra signals and superimpose them in a single color image, so that differences in the distribution of the various components of the specimen can be seen clearly and compared. Optionally, the standard secondary <b>electron</b> <b>image</b> can be merged with the one or more compositional channels, so that the specimen's structure and composition can be compared. [...] Such images can be made while maintaining the full integrity of the original signal data, which is not modified in any way.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} form of electron microscope, the {{transmission electron microscope}} (TEM) uses a high voltage electron beam to illuminate the specimen and create an image. The electron beam is produced by an electron gun, commonly fitted with a tungsten filament cathode as the electron source. The electron beam is accelerated by an anode typically at +100 keV (40 to 400 keV) {{with respect to the}} cathode, focused by electrostatic and electromagnetic lenses, and transmitted through the specimen that is in part transparent to electrons and in part scatters them out of the beam. When it emerges from the specimen, the electron beam carries information about the structure of the specimen that is magnified by the objective lens system of the microscope. The spatial variation in this information (the [...] "image") may be viewed by projecting the magnified <b>electron</b> <b>image</b> onto a fluorescent viewing screen coated with a phosphor or scintillator material such as zinc sulfide. Alternatively, the image can be photographically recorded by exposing a photographic film or plate directly to the electron beam, or a high-resolution phosphor may be coupled by means of a lens optical system or a fibre optic light-guide to the sensor of a digital camera. The image detected by the digital camera may be displayed on a monitor or computer.|$|E

40|$|Background: The unique surface {{sensitivity}} {{and the high}} resolution {{that can be achieved}} with helium ion microscopy make it a competitive technique for modern materials characterization. As in other techniques that make use of a charged particle beam, channeling through the crystal structure of the bulk of the material can occur. Results: Here, we demonstrate how this bulk phenomenon affects secondary <b>electron</b> <b>images</b> that predominantly contain surface information. In addition, we will show how {{it can be used to}} obtain crystallographic information. We will discuss the origin of channeling contrast in secondary <b>electron</b> <b>images,</b> illustrate this with experiments, and develop a simple geometric model to predict channeling maxima. Conclusion: Channeling plays an important role in helium ion microscopy and has to be taken into account when trying to achieve maximum image quality in backscattered helium images as well as secondary <b>electron</b> <b>images.</b> Secondary <b>electron</b> <b>images</b> can be used to extract crystallographic information from bulk samples as well as from thin surface layers, in a straightforward manner...|$|R

5000|$|An image {{dissector}} focuses a visual image onto {{a layer of}} photosensitive material, such as caesium oxide, which emits negatively charged [...] "photoelectrons" [...] proportional to {{the intensity of the}} light striking the material. Electrostatic deflecting plates or magnetic fields then periodically manipulate the resulting <b>electron</b> <b>image</b> horizontally and vertically before an electron multiplier, or a small aperture leading to a positively charged detector or [...] "anode" [...] {{in the case of the}} earliest dissector tubes. The electron multiplier or aperture permits only those electrons emanating from a very small area of the <b>electron</b> <b>image,</b> representing a similarly small area of the visual image. The entire image is scanned several times per second to produce an electrical signal suitably representative of a moving visual image.|$|E
50|$|A {{detector}} {{is placed}} {{at the end of}} electron optical column. Usually, a phosphor screen is used to convert the <b>electron</b> <b>image</b> to a photon image. The choice of phosphor type is governed by resolution considerations. A multichannel plate detector that is imaged by a CCD camera can substitute phosphor screen.|$|E
50|$|The {{optical system}} of the image {{dissector}} focuses an image onto a photocathode mounted inside a high vacuum. As light strikes the photocathode, electrons are emitted {{in proportion to the}} intensity of the light (see photoelectric effect). The entire <b>electron</b> <b>image</b> is deflected and a scanning aperture permits only those electrons emanating from a very small area of the photocathode to be captured by the detector at any given time. The output from the detector is an electric current whose magnitude {{is a measure of the}} brightness of the corresponding area of the image. The <b>electron</b> <b>image</b> is periodically deflected horizontally and vertically ("raster scanning") such that the entire image is read by the detector many times per second, producing an electrical signal that can be conveyed to a display device, such as a CRT monitor, to reproduce the image.|$|E

However, there are substantial technical challenges including reliable co-registration of optical and <b>electron</b> <b>images,</b> and rapid optical signal degradation under electron beam irradiation. Here, we {{introduce a new}} approach to solve these problems: multi-color imaging of stable optical cathodoluminescence emitted in a scanning electron microscope by nanoparticles with controllable surface chemistry. We demonstrate well-correlated cathodoluminescence and secondary <b>electron</b> <b>images</b> using three species of semiconductor nanoparticles that contain defects providing stable, spectrally-distinguishable cathodoluminescence. We also demonstrate reliable surface functionalization of the particles. The results pave the way for the use of such nanoparticles for targeted labeling of surfaces to provide nanoscale mapping of molecular composition, indicated by cathodoluminescence color, simultaneously acquired with structural <b>electron</b> <b>images</b> in a single instrument.

50|$|The image {{iconoscope}} is essentially {{identical to the}} super-Emitron, but the target is constructed of {{a thin layer of}} isolating material placed on top of a conductive base, the mosaic of metallic granules is missing. Therefore, secondary electrons are emitted {{from the surface of the}} isolating material when the <b>electron</b> <b>image</b> reaches the target, and the resulting positive charges are stored directly onto the surface of the isolated material.|$|E
50|$|The super-Emitron is a {{combination}} of the image dissector and the Emitron. The scene image is projected onto an efficient continuous-film semitransparent photocathode that transforms the scene light into a light-emitted <b>electron</b> <b>image,</b> the latter is then accelerated (and focused) via electromagnetic fields towards a target specially prepared for the emission of secondary electrons. Each individual electron from the <b>electron</b> <b>image</b> produces several secondary electrons after reaching the target, so that an amplification effect is produced, and the resulting positive charge is proportional to the integrated intensity of the scene light. The target is constructed of a mosaic of electrically isolated metallic granules separated from a common plate by a thin layer of isolating material, so that the positive charge resulting from the secondary emission is stored in the capacitor formed by the metallic granule and the common plate. Finally, an electron beam periodically sweeps across the target, effectively scanning the stored image and discharging each capacitor in turn such that the electrical output from each capacitor is proportional to the average intensity of the scene light between each discharge event (as in the iconoscope).|$|E
5000|$|An image {{dissector}}, {{also called}} a dissector tube, is {{a video camera}} tube in which photocathode emissions create an [...] "electron image" [...] which is then scanned to produce an electrical signal representing the visual image. The term may apply specifically to a dissector tube employing magnetic fields to keep the <b>electron</b> <b>image</b> in focus, and an electron multiplier to scan the electrons. Dissectors were used only briefly in television systems before being replaced by the much more sensitive iconoscope during the 1930s.|$|E

Moreover, the nonconductive biological samples can be observed without charging effects if they are thin enough to ensure that a significant fraction of the electron beam crosses the specimen...|$|R

5000|$|An image {{dissector}} is a camera tube that creates an [...] "electron image" [...] {{of a scene}} from photocathode emissions (electrons) which pass through a scanning aperture to an anode, which serves as an electron detector. Among the first to design such a device were German inventors Max Dieckmann and Rudolf Hell, who had titled their 1925 patent application Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher (Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television). The term may apply specifically to a dissector tube employing magnetic fields to keep the <b>electron</b> <b>image</b> in focus, an element lacking in Dieckmann and Hell's design, {{and in the early}} dissector tubes built by American inventor Philo Farnsworth.|$|E
50|$|In Zuo’s approach, a low {{resolution}} <b>electron</b> <b>image</b> {{is used to}} locate a nanotube. A field emission electron gun generates a beam with high coherence and high intensity. The beam size is limited to nano area with the condenser aperture {{in order to ensure}} scattering from only a section of the nanotube of interest. The diffraction pattern is recorded in the far field using electron imaging plates to a resolution of 0.0025 1/Å. Using a typical HIO reconstruction method an image is produced with Å resolution in which the DWCNT chirality (lattice structure) can be directly observed. Zuo found {{that it is possible to}} start with non-random phases based on a {{low resolution}} image from a TEM to improve the final image quality.|$|E

50|$|Another {{advantage}} of FIB {{secondary electron imaging}} {{is the fact that}} the ion beam does not alter the signal from fluorescent probes used in the labelling of proteins, thus creating the opportunity to correlate FIB secondary <b>electron</b> <b>images</b> with images obtained by fluorescence microscopes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{new video}} camera tube {{developed}} by Lubszynski, Rodda and McGee in 1934 was dubbed [...] "the super-Emitron". This tube {{is a combination}} of the image dissector and the Emitron.

Each individual electron from the <b>electron</b> <b>image</b> produces several secondary electrons after reaching the target, so that an amplification effect is produced.

5000|$|In January 1927, Farnsworth {{applied for}} a patent for his Television System that {{included}} a device for [...] "the conversion and dissecting of light".Its first moving image was successfully transmitted on September 7 of 1927, and a patent was issued in 1930. Farnsworth quickly made improvements to the device, among them introducing an electron multiplier made of nickel and deploying a [...] "longitudinal magnetic field" [...] in order to sharply focus the <b>electron</b> <b>image.</b> The improved device was demonstrated to the press in early September 1928. The introduction of a multipactor in October 1933 and a multi-dynode [...] "electron multiplier" [...] in 1937 made Farnsworth's image dissector the first practical version of a fully electronic imaging device for television. Unfortunately, it had very poor light sensitivity, and was therefore primarily useful only where illumination was exceptionally high (typically over 685 cd/m²). However, it was ideal for industrial applications, such as monitoring the bright interior of an industrial furnace. Due to their poor light sensitivity, image dissectors were rarely used in television broadcasting, except to scan film and other transparencies.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the image}} store, light falls upon the {{photocathode}} {{which is a}} photosensitive plate at a very negative potential (approx. -600 V), and is converted into an <b>electron</b> <b>image</b> (a principle borrowed from the image dissector). This electron rain is then accelerated towards the target (a very thin glass plate acting as a semi-isolator) at ground potential (0 V), and passes through a very fine wire mesh (near 200 wires per cm), very near (a few hundredths of cm) and parallel to the target, acting as a screen grid at a slightly positive voltage (approx +2 V). Once the image electrons reach the target, they cause a [...] "splash" [...] of electrons by the effect of secondary emission. On average, each image electron ejects several [...] "splash" [...] electrons (thus adding amplification by secondary emission), and these excess electrons are soaked up by the positive mesh effectively removing electrons from the target and causing a positive charge on it {{in relation to the}} incident light in the photocathode. The result is an image painted in positive charge, with the brightest portions having the largest positive charge.|$|E
