25|$|In 1866, citing <b>excessive</b> <b>costs,</b> the Portuguese {{government}} {{withdrew the}} garrison. Pedro continued his rule, however, though he faced increasing rivalry from clan-based trading magnates who drained his authority from {{much of the}} country. The most dangerous of these was Garcia Mbwaka Matu {{of the town of}} Makuta. This town had been founded by a man named Kuvo, who probably obtained his wealth through trade, since he and Garcia made a great deal of controlling markets. Though this was a great challenge in the 1870s, after Garcia's death in 1880, Makuta became less problematic.|$|E
25|$|Tromsø was {{selected}} by the Norwegian National Olympic Committee as Norway's candidate for the 2018 Winter Olympics. This would have made Tromsø the first city north of the Arctic Circle to host the games. There were plans to use ships as the media village. In October 2008 the NOC suspended Tromsø's bid, citing <b>excessive</b> <b>costs.</b> From the southern to {{the northern tip of}} the island Tromsøya, there is a floodlit cross country ski track. A ski jump is also situated on the island, close to the university. As of the spring in 2010, the city's first ice rink has been open and is home to Tromsø Hockey, which plays in the Swedish Ice Hockey Association's League 3.|$|E
25|$|Since {{only one}} female {{in a group}} breeds, heavy {{investment}} in infant care ensures that all offspring survive until independence. Accordingly, cotton-top tamarins bear <b>excessive</b> <b>costs</b> {{to care for the}} group's young. Male carriers, especially paternal carriers, incur large energetic costs {{for the sake of the}} group's young. This burden may cause some male cotton-tops to lose up to 10–11% of their total body weight. The large weight loss may occur from reduced food intake as infant-carrying inhibits foraging ability for a carrier. The trend of male-carrier weight loss and decreased food intake is in contrast to the dominant female's periovulatory period, when she gains weight after increasing her own food intake and relinquishing much of her infant-carrying duties.|$|E

25|$|The present, {{much larger}} {{building}} of the railway station was designed by Alexey Dushkin. Its construction was started on 13 September 1950 and completed on 10 September 1952, and the luggage section was added in 1956. In the 1950s Sochi {{played an important role}} in the Soviet Unions, being a major transit point from Russia to Georgia and the most popular health resort for a large number of ordinary citizens and Communist Party leaders, including Joseph Stalin. Consequently, the station construction was curated by an unusually large number of ministries, and by Stalin himself. While Dushkin's design was considered elegant by many curators, including Stalin, it was criticised by others for <b>excessive</b> <b>costs.</b> Dushkin built a twin version of the Sochi station in Simferopol in 1951. In 1975, the Sochi station was included to the Russian list of architectural monuments of federal importance.|$|E

500|$|In her tenures as a Chief Minister, Mayawati {{commissioned}} {{the production and}} public display of several statues representing Buddhist, Hindu, and Dalit icons like Gautama Buddha, Gadge Maharaj, Sant Ravidas, Sant Kabir, Narayana Guru, Jyotirao Phule, Chatrapati Shahuji Maharaj, Babasaheb Ambedkar, BSP party founder Kanshi Ram, and of herself. She claims that the expenditure was required because the past governments did not show respect towards Dalit leaders, in whose memory nothing had ever been built. She spent somewhere between [...] 25 and 60 billion rupees (about US$500 million to US$1.3 billion) on projects in five parks and at memorials such as Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Samajik Parivartan Sthal and Manyavar Kanshiram Smarak Sthal, built {{in the name of}} B.R. Ambedkar, Ramabai Ambedkar, and Kanshi Ram in Lucknow between 2007 and 2009. In June 2009 the Supreme Court issued a stay against further building on the projects, until the Public Interest Litigation (PLI) questioning these expenditures was settled. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India reported that [...] 66 crore (about US$12 million) in <b>excessive</b> <b>costs</b> had been incurred on the construction of the memorials. [...] In February 2010 Mayawati's government approved a plan for a special police force to protect the statues, as she feared that her political opponents might demolish them. In December 2010, her government received permission to continue part of the plan, namely maintenance and completion of Ambedkar Memorial Park.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the two most serious {{shortcomings}} of {{the current system of}} lowincome housing assistance are its excessive reliance on project-based assistance and its failure to provide housing assistance to all of the poorest families who ask for help.

2500|$|On 16 October 2008, the Army's Acquisition Executive Office for Aviation {{directed}} {{that the}} ARH contract be terminated completely {{for the convenience}} of the government.

2500|$|Another activist viceroy {{carrying}} out reforms was Antonio María de Bucareli y Ursúa, marqués de Valleheroso y conde de Jerena, who served from 1771 to 1779, {{and died in}} office. José de Gálvez, now Minister of the Indies following his appointment as Visitor General of New Spain, briefed the newly appointed viceroy about reforms to be implemented. In 1776, a new northern territorial division was established, Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas known as the Provincias Internas (Commandancy General of the Internal Provinces of the North, [...] ). Teodoro de Croix (nephew of the former viceroy) was appointed the first Commander General of the Provincias Internas, independent of the Viceroy of New Spain, to provide better administration for the northern frontier provinces. They included Nueva Vizcaya, Nuevo Santander, Sonora y Sinaloa, Las Californias, Coahuila y Tejas (Coahuila and Texas), and Nuevo México.

2500|$|Prime Minister Thatcher {{expected}} Scargill {{to force}} a confrontation, and in response she set up a defence in depth. She believed that the <b>excessive</b> <b>costs</b> of increasingly inefficient collieries had to end in order to grow the economy. She planned to close inefficient pits and depend more on imported coal, oil, gas and nuclear. She appointed hardliners to key positions, set up a high level planning committee, and allocated funds from the highly profitable electrical supply system to stockpile {{at least six months}} worth of coal. Thatcher's team set up mobile police units so that forces from outside the strike areas could neutralise efforts by flying pickets to stop the transport of coal to power stations. It used the National Recording Centre (NRC), set up in 1972 by the Association of Chief Police Officers for England and Wales linking 43 police forces to enable police forces to travel to assist in major disturbances. [...] Scargill played into her hands by ignoring the buildup of coal stocks and calling the strike at the end of winter when demand for coal was declining. His refusal to hold a strike ballot weakened support from other unions and the general public. Without a national ballot, miners in Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, South Derbyshire, North Wales and parts of Lancashire kept working and Scargill sent flying pickets to prevent them. The police provided protection for working miners.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was no such}} {{tragedy in}} Montreal in 1976, but bad {{planning}} and fraud led to the Games' cost far exceeding the budget. The Montreal Games were the most expensive in Olympic history, until the 2014 Winter Olympics, costing over $5billion (equivalent to $20billion in 2016). For a time, {{it seemed that the}} Olympics might no longer be a viable financial proposition. In retrospect, the belief that contractors (suspected of being members of the Montreal Mafia) skimmed large sums of money from all levels of contracts while also profiting from the substitution of cheaper building materials of lesser quality, {{may have contributed to the}} delays, poor construction and <b>excessive</b> <b>costs.</b> In 1988, one such contractor, Giuseppe Zappia [...] "was cleared of fraud charges that resulted from his work on Olympic facilities after two key witnesses died before testifying at his trial." [...] There was also a boycott by African nations to protest against a recent tour of apartheid-run South Africa by the New Zealand national rugby union team. The Romanian gymnast Nadia Comăneci won the women's individual all around gold medal with two of four possible perfect scores, thus giving birth to a gymnastics dynasty in Romania.
