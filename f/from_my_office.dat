I congratulate you not alone on the execution but also for the spirit which impelled you to make this contribution to the common cause of a freer, happier world". Roosevelt wrote to The Post, [...] "This is the first pictorial representation I have seen of the staunchly American values contained in the rights of free speech and free worship and our goals of freedom from fear and want." [...] Roosevelt also wrote of the corresponding essays, [...] "Their words should inspire all who read them with a deeper appreciation of the way of life we are striving to preserve." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jones often {{displayed}} a sheepish, self-deprecating {{sense of humor}} regarding his dire financial standing and bad reputation. [...] In June 1979, he appeared with Waylon Jennings on Ralph Emery's syndicated radio program {{and at one point}} Jennings cracked, [...] "It's lonely at the top." [...] A laughing Jones replied, [...] "It's lonely at the bottom, too! [...] It's real, real lonely, Waylon." [...] Despite his chronic unreliability, Jones was still capable of putting on a captivating live show. [...] On Independence Day, 1976, he appeared at Willie Nelson's Fourth of July Picnic in Gonzales, Texas in front of 80,000 younger, country-rock oriented fans. [...] A nervous Jones felt out of his comfort zone and nearly bolted from the festival but went on anyway and wound up stealing the show. [...] The Houston Post wrote, [...] "He was the undisputed star of this year's Willie Nelson picnic...one of the greatest." [...] Penthouse called him [...] "...the spirit of country music, plain and simple, its Holy Ghost". [...] The Village Voice added [...] "As a singer he is as intelligent as they come, and should be considered for a spot in America's all-time top ten." [...] Jones began missing more shows than he made, however, including several highly publicized dates at the Bottom Line club in New York City. [...] Former vice president of CBS Records Rick Blackburn recalls in the 1989 video Same Ole Me that the event had been hyped for weeks, with a lot of top press and cast members from Saturday Night Live planning to attend. [...] "We'd made our plans, travel arrangements and so forth. [...] George excused himself <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>office,</b> left - and we didn't see him for three weeks. [...] He just did not show up." [...] Much like Hank Williams, Jones seemed suspicious of success and furiously despised perceived slights and condescension directed towards the music that he loved so dearly. [...] When he finally played the Bottom Line in 1980, the New York Times called him [...] "the finest, most riveting singer in country music." ...|$|E

My sister mentioned an idea we had both expressed back in 1976 on opening an old-house restaurant, hopefully in Jefferson. I flew back from Arizona and scouted the Jefferson and East Texas small towns looking for that ‘just right’ house. After making the usual circuit in Jefferson and seeing nothing new, I decided to return home and seeing Highway 59 in the distance, I thought that Moseley Street would lead right into it. Halfway down the street I saw a beautiful Greek Revival home almost covered with vines and underbrush, with a ‘For Sale’ sign on it.” ...|$|R

Hurrying away <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>office</b> at odd times to furniture and department stores to help decide such momentous questions as curtains, carpets, chairs and tables I would often spy the tall, uncompromising figure of Susan Peters standing beside Maude's, while an obliging clerk spread out, anxiously, rugs or wall-papers for their inspection.|$|E

You will find some of your friends who will talk of the 'Deane Blackmailing Affair,' and who will never be quite sure whether I was prosecutor or defendant. You will find all your life my name looked upon with a certain amount of suspicion, because, in a case of this sort, prosecutor and defendant, and even the witnesses, are all classed together by that somewhat vague portion of the public which your friends represent.
