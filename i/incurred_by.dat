5|$|Only 100 of the 2,400 tons of {{supplies}} {{scheduled to be}} landed on D-Day were landed. An accurate figure for casualties <b>incurred</b> <b>by</b> V Corps at Omaha on 6 June is not known; sources vary between 2,000 and 4,700 killed, wounded, and missing, with the heaviest losses <b>incurred</b> <b>by</b> the infantry, tanks and engineers in the first landings. Only five tanks of the 741st Tank Battalion were ready for action the next day. The German 352nd division suffered 1,200 killed, wounded and missing; about 20% of its strength. Its deployment at the beach caused such problems that Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, commander of the U.S. First Army, at one stage considered evacuating Omaha, while Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery considered the possibility of diverting V Corps forces through Gold.|$|E
5|$|Although {{advertising}} revenue increased post-aggregation, local programming declined {{as a result}} of the costs <b>incurred</b> <b>by</b> the network's expansion – an estimated $45 million had been spent by Ramcorp during and in the lead-up to aggregation.

5|$|The Oxford Olympics Study 2016 {{estimates}} the outturn {{cost of the}} Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics at USD 6.8 billion in 2015-dollars and cost overrun at 2% in real terms. This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) operational costs <b>incurred</b> <b>by</b> the organizing committee {{for the purpose of}} staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) direct capital costs <b>incurred</b> <b>by</b> the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Beijing Olympics' cost of USD 6.8 billion compares with costs of USD 4.6 billion for Rio 2016 and USD 15 billion for London 2012. Average cost for the Summer Games since 1960 is USD 5.2 billion.|$|E

5|$|Despite strong pacifist {{sentiment}} after World War I, {{its aftermath}} still caused irredentist and revanchist nationalism in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany {{because of the}} significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses <b>incurred</b> <b>by</b> the Treaty of Versailles. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 per cent of its home territory {{and all of its}} overseas possessions, while German annexation of other states was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's armed forces.|$|E
5|$|During construction, {{the need}} for new water and {{electrical}} supply lines arose. Because these were not factored into the original $65million cost, another $5million was appropriated from existing capital funds. Another $5million was later required to pay for cleaning contaminated soil, increased sub-contractor pricing, additional labor costs <b>incurred</b> <b>by</b> delays caused by snow and ice, and upgrades including the guitar-shaped scoreboard. The Sounds ownership team contributed $2million toward the cost of the scoreboard. These and other additional expenditures, such as a $9.5million greenway, $5.6million for street paving, sidewalks, and electrical work, and $3.6million in flood prevention, brought the total construction cost of the stadium to $56million and the total cost of the project to $91million.|$|E

5|$|For {{various reasons}} it was {{impossible}} to apply some of the terms of the Act. Less eligibility was in some cases impossible without starving paupers and the high cost of building workhouses <b>incurred</b> <b>by</b> rate payers meant that outdoor relief continued to be a popular alternative. Despite efforts to ban outdoor relief, parishes continued to offer it as a more cost-effective method of dealing with pauperism. The Outdoor Labour Test Order and Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order were both issued to try to prevent people receiving relief outside of the workhouse.|$|E
5|$|On 5 July 1943, the Germans {{launched}} the Battle of Kursk, an offensive designed {{to eliminate the}} Kursk salient. The Waffen-SS by this time had been expanded to 12 divisions, and most {{took part in the}} battle. Due to stiff Soviet resistance, Hitler halted the attack by the evening of 12 July. On 17 July he called off the operation and ordered a withdrawal. Thereafter, the Germans were forced onto the defensive as the Red Army began the liberation of Western Russia. The losses <b>incurred</b> <b>by</b> the Waffen-SS and the Wehrmacht during the Battle of Kursk occurred nearly simultaneously with the Allied assault into Italy, opening a two-front war for Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Rhodesian {{economy grew}} {{considerably}} {{during the war}} despite the concurrent rise of war expenditure {{to pay for the}} expansion of the military and the air training scheme. Expenditure on the war grew from £1,793,367 in the financial year 1940–41 to £5,334,701 in 1943–44—total Southern Rhodesian expenditure on the air training scheme was £11,215,522. These sums, while tiny compared to those <b>incurred</b> <b>by</b> larger nations, were enormous when scaled against the white population of less than 70,000 that accounted for most of the colony's economic output. Annual costs for the air training scheme alone far exceeded the pre-war national budget.|$|E

5|$|A {{document}} prepared on 17 July 1943 by the 5th Guards Tank Army headquarters summarised {{the combat}} losses <b>incurred</b> <b>by</b> the formation from 12 to 16 July inclusive {{for all of}} its five corps, as well as smaller units directly subordinated to the army headquarters. The document reported the following irrecoverable losses: 222 T-34s, 89 T-70s, 12 Churchills, 8 SU-122s, 3 SU-76s, and 240 support vehicles. The document reported damaged vehicles still under repair as 143 T-34s, 56 T-70s, 7 Churchills, 3 SU-122s, and 3 SU-76s, with no figures for support vehicles. The document reported personnel casualties as 2,940 killed in action, 3,510 wounded in action, and 1,157 missing in action. This totals 334 irrevocable losses in tanks and self-propelled guns, with another 212 tanks and self-propelled guns under repair, and 7,607 casualties. The historian Karl-Heinz Frieser argued that the majority of these losses must have occurred on 12 July.|$|E
5|$|After docking in Kiel, the {{men from}} Asar-i Tevfik were {{transferred}} to İzmir, but with no funds to buy coal, the men were stranded in Germany. Germaniawerft stripped down Asar-i Tevfik, but then halted work to await the first Ottoman payment. By mid-1901, the men had accumulated significant debt and the Ottoman government had {{made no effort to}} return them or pay the installments for the modernization program. Even Kaiser Wilhelm II became involved in an attempt to press the Ottoman government to settle the debts <b>incurred</b> <b>by</b> the sailors. Instead, the Ottomans demanded that Krupp, the owner of the Germaniawerft shipyard, make an advance of 6,000lira so that İzmir could be prepared for the voyage back to Constantinople. The Ottomans were at the time negotiating for a large armament contract with Krupp for the Army, and used this as leverage; by late 1901, Krupp conceded, rather than risk the lucrative contract. The debts in Kiel were paid and İzmir finally departed for home.|$|E
