40|$|Global {{growth of}} nuclear energy in the 21 st century is {{creating}} new challenges to limit {{the spread of nuclear}} technology without hindering adoption in countries now considering nuclear power. Independent nuclear states desire autonomy over energy choices and seek energy independence. However, this independence comes with high costs for development of new <b>indigenous</b> <b>fuel</b> cycle capabilities. Nuclear supplier states and expert groups have proposed fuel supply assurance mechanisms such as fuel take-back services, international enrichment services and fuel banks in exchange for recipient state concessions on the development of sensitive technologies. Nuclear states are slow to accept any concessions to their rights under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. To date, decisions not to develop <b>indigenous</b> <b>fuel</b> cycle capabilities have been driven primarily by economics. However, additional incentives may be required to offset a nuclear state’s perceived loss of energy independence. This paper proposes alternative economic development incentives that could help countries decide to forgo development of sensitive nuclear technologies.

Peat contributes to energy security [...] as an <b>indigenous</b> <b>fuel,</b> it reduces dependency on imports. During {{a period of}} low capacity margins, {{the operation of the}} peat plants is useful from a system security perspective. Peat generation is being financially supported by consumers through an electricity levy. The fuel also has high carbon intensity.

This paper reviews electricity generation through combustion of peat in Ireland, and quantifies the costs of supporting peat utilising economic dispatch tools, finding the subsidy is not insignificant from a cost or carbon perspective. It shows that while peat is beneficial for one pillar of energy policy (security), the current usage of peat is not optimal from a competitiveness or environmental perspective. By switching from the current 'must-run' mode of operation for peat to the 'dispatched' mode used for the other generation, significant societal savings (in the range [euro] 21 Â m per annum) can be achieved, as well as reducing system emissions by approximately 5 % per year.

In 2005 domestic lignite with {{a share of}} 60. 5 % in power generation and accounting about 30 % of primary energy consumption is currently the most important <b>indigenous</b> <b>fuel</b> of Greece. Greece, mining 70 Â Mt annually, is the second lignite producer in the EU and fourth in the world. Approximately 97 % of the lignite used to supply the existing lignite-fired power plants of Greece is mined by Public Power Corporation S. A. (PPC). Lignite as the base load fuel gives a competitive strength in PPC's and Greece's fuel mix. Due to lignite consumer prices in Greece are significantly below those in other comparable markets in EU- 15. Extraction of lignite has a very long tradition.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Biomass {{co-firing}} with lignite {{represents an}} attractive solution for operating lignite-fired thermal power plants (TPP) with the dual advantage of using local renewable resources and simultaneously reducing emissions. The {{subject of this}} study is technical and environmental investigation of the feasibility of the co-firing of Soma lignite with some dried agricultural residues in the Soma thermal power plant from the exergy analysis perspective, using THERMOFLEX simulation software. The use of biomass cofiring with poor quality coal could allow Turkey to comply with Kyoto commitments while benefiting from using <b>indigenous</b> <b>fuel</b> resources and reducing biomass waste disposal problems. Two technologies are considered; (1) direct co-firing, in which biomass is mixed with lignite in the same mill and fed into the boiler furnace and (2) parallel co-firing method, in which biomass is fired in a separate circulating fluidized bed boiler and produced steam is supplemented into the steam network of the power plant. The investigations reveal that both direct and parallel co-firing of the biomass could result in a significant decrease in fuel consumption, emissions and exergy destruction and a slight increase in the exergy efficiency of the Soma TPP. Olive waste, in particular, has a positive effect on general performance and emissions of the TPP, with fuel consumption, CO 2, SO 2 and dust emissions, in direct co-firing dropping by approximately 20, 4, 19 and 18 percent, respectively, and in parallel co-firing by 26, 3, 20 and 25 percent, respectively...|$|E

40|$|In the past, Tasmania {{was seen}} as having enormous, {{possibly}} unlimited supplies of hydro-electrical power. This view combined with appreciation of Tasmania's difficult economic circumstances to lend support to development of energy intensive industries, such as the COMALCO aluminium smelter at Bell Bay. This pattern of industrial development, which also relied on the initial processing of Tasmanian resources, {{has been described as}} 'hydro-industrialisation'. Over the 1970 s Tasmania has shared the worldwide development of problems with energy supply, which have centered around the 1973 OPEC oil price increases and embargo. Tasmania has also developed problems surrounding its major <b>indigenous</b> <b>fuel</b> hydro-electricity. These issues have combined to produce a new energy supply situation for Tasmania; one that is marked by shortage, not abundance. The energy supply questions have arisen {{at the same time as}} pressing unemployment problems and slowing of economic growth. Since one of the major thrusts of Tasmanian economic development has been energy intensive manufacturing industry, this thesis examines the response of manufacturing to this new energy supply situation, to see how Tasmanian manufacturing energy use, employment and output have been affected. It goes on to look at changes in manufacturing production and the structure of manufacturing, in terms of three ratios: energy use to output, energy use to employment and employment to output. This examination shows the likely implications of trends in manufacturing, and manufacturing structure coming from the changed energy supply situation. The analysis shows that trends in Tasmanian manufacturing energy use, energy intensity, production process and structure are largely a continuation of past trends. They have not shown a strong response to changes in energy supply over the 1970 s. Continuation of these-trends is likely to have important social implications for the stability of economic growth and employment in Tasmania, as well as being significant for future energy policy...|$|E
40|$|With an {{increase}} in greenhouse gas emissions and the ever-imminent concern of depleting fuel sources around the world, {{the need for a}} renewable source of fuel has become a highly warranted interest. With Australia currently importing approximately 91 % of its fuel source, it is estimated by 2030 Australia will have no <b>indigenous</b> <b>fuel</b> refinery capacity. To prevent the need to import 100 % of Australia’s fuel source, gasoline ethanol blended fuels have been considered as an alternative. Ethanol is a renewable source of fuel, as it can be made from agricultural crops within the country. The Australian Fuel Standards Quality Act of 2000 has limited the commercial production of gasoline and ethanol blended fuels (also known as gasohol), to 10 % ethanol and 90 % gasoline blend or better known as E 10. This is because gasohol has the capability to corrode an internal combustion engine (ICE) internally. However, since the Australian Government produces and commercially sells E 10 at fuel stations throughout the country there must be beneficial effects of gasohol. The benefits of gasohol have been stated to involve a major reduction in exhaust emissions such as nitrogen oxide (), hydro carbon (), and carbon monoxide (). However, it has not been stated whether gasohol presents any performance benefits when used to counteract possible corrosion in current ICEs, especially at higher ethanol blends. For the ability to use higher ethanol blended fuels, modifications to the current ICE is required. This thesis looks to investigate the performance aspects of using gasohol in relation to torque and fuel consumption and whether the performance aspects and emission reduction are worth the need to modify current ICE for future vehicle developments. Literature regarding this topic was analysed and discussed. Predictions on physical testing based upon literature were made for a 6 cylinder Barra engine using E 5, E 10, E 15, and E 20 to obtain results relating to the torque and fuel consumption with in a real world operating ICE. The data is to be compared to a benchmark base result using unleaded 91 fuel...|$|E

Hydrological investigations point to large resources of underground water, but they are saline {{and need to be}} desalted. The best choice for providing fresh water in the Arabian Gulf countries is through seawater desalination with ground water as a back up. About 65 % of desalination plants that are in operation worldwide are located in the Arabian Gulf counlries, most of which are the dual-purpose multistage flash (MSF) plants, producing power and water. Reverse osmosis (RO) is used mainly for brackish water treatment and a limited number of multiple effect distillation (MED) plants are used in the Arabian Gulf countries. The use of nuclear desalination is practically essential in these countries where massive quantities of water are desalinated and there is a fast increase in power demand. There is no technical impediment to the use of nuclear reactors for supply of either heat or electricity or both to a desalination plant. However, the cost effectiveness of nuclear desalination is a site dependent matter. The type of desalination process and the size and type of the nuclear reactor have to be determined based on the specific site data. MSF plants are considered as energy intensive processes where energy cost is a major controlling parameter in the overall cost of desalination. Oil price fluctuations affect the cost of desalted water significantly, whereas nuclear power offers long term availability of <b>indigenous</b> <b>fuel</b> as well as long term fuel price stability. It has minimal environmental impact compared with other conventional desalination processes.

40|$|Bibliographical {{references}} {{included in}} footnotes. This is {{a preliminary report}} which considers some of the social policy {{issues raised by the}} prospects for geothermal resource development in the State of Hawaii. In one sense it is paradoxical to report on these issues in advance of the event, for there is still much uncertainty about {{the quantity and quality of}} geothermal resources in this state, and therefore their significance for the Hawaii economy can yet be sketched only in a provisional way. It would be much easier for the state government if it could defer any action relating to geothermal resources until the facts are in, but, for reasons stated in the following pages, delay would inhibit geothermal development in a period of urgent search for new power sources. The facts are being researched under the Hawaii Geothermal Project at the University of Hawaii, financed by grants from the National Science Foundation, the State and the County of Hawaii. Geologists and geophysicists are studying the resource to determine if and where it can best be tapped; engineers are seeking to design the best technology for utilizing the resource to generate electricity in a relatively non-polluting way. But this research takes time. It will be several months before a test geothermal well is drilled and more than a year after that before a pilot plant can be constructed and put in operation to demonstrate the feasibility of geothermal power in Hawaii. And yet, basic policy issues present themselves to the state government even before the size and shape of geothermal development can become clear. Economic anticipation, including land-leasing speculation in rights to exploit geothermal resources, flies ahead of the demonstration of economic feasibility. Private and public planning must take that anticipation into account. Thus the executive branch of the Hawaii state government has had a bill introduced before the current session of the state legislature to determine the nature and ownership of the resource. Such determination would reduce legal uncertainties surrounding this new resource and thus advance its economic development. Current events heighten feelings of urgency for geothermal development in Hawaii. The national fuel crisis begins to bear heavily on a community which uses oil intensely, and threatens to increase further a level of unemployment already higher than the national average and considerably above what Hawaii had experienced in the last decade. It is against this background of an urgent search for an <b>indigenous</b> <b>fuel</b> supply and a new economic base that this preliminary report has been written...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} global {{oil resources}} and the future global oil supply/demand balance. The paper builds upon several comprehensive databases designed during the work and considerable efforts {{have been made to}} review what must be considered the most reliable data. Global oil resources have been investigated on three levels; country, company and field levels. Although no decisive conclusions or quantitative assessments can be made with respect to the global oil resource base, remaining resources appear to be sufficient to meet demand up to 2030 as projected in the 2006 (and 2007) world energy outlook by the IEA. Significant resources have already been discovered beyond proven reserves, many prospective regions remain to be fully explored and there are vast volumes of recoverable unconventional oil. However, it is also concluded that global supply of oil probably will continue to be tight, both in the medium term {{as well as in the}} long term mainly as a consequence of above-ground factors such as investment constraints, geopolitical tensions, limited access to reserves and mature super-giant fields. Production of unconventional oil and synthetic fuels is not believed to significantly alter this situation. Although an increasing number of recent reports have indicated an imminent or "soon to come" peak in global oil supply, it has not been found that any of these reports have contributed with any new information on oil resources or oil supply ability. Nevertheless, there is a distinct possibility that global oil production may peak or plateau in a relatively near future, not caused by limited resources but because too many factors over long time constrain investments into exploration and production. The lack of transparency within the oil industry obviously prevents any accurate analysis of future production and supply ability. Moreover, our ability to analyse the sector will become more difficult in the future as oil increasingly will have to be sourced from countries with a poor transparency. The world will become increasingly dependent on a few countries in the Middle East and on Russia not only for the supply of oil but also for the supply of gas which to a large extent will be utilised for power and heat generation. A responsible policy should under these circumstances seek to enhance energy security which should be directed towards promoting energy efficiency measures (reduce demand) in combination with increased utilisation of <b>indigenous</b> <b>fuel</b> resources such as renewables and fossil fuels in combination with CO 2 capture and storage.

The CCT Program represents an investment of over $ 5. 2 billion in advanced coal-based technology, with industry and state governments providing an unprecedented 66 percent of the funding. With 26 of the 38 active projects having completed operations, the CCT Program has yielded clean coal technologies (CCTs) {{that are capable of}} meeting existing and emerging environmental regulations and competing in a deregulated electric power marketplace. The CCT Program is providing a portfolio of technologies that will assure that U. S. recoverable coal reserves of 274 billion tons can continue to supply the nation's energy needs economically and in an environmentally sound manner. As the nation embarks on a new millennium, many of the clean coal technologies have realized commercial application. Industry stands ready to respond to the energy and environmental demands of the 21 st century, both domestically and internationally, For existing power plants, there are cost-effective environmental control devices to control sulfur dioxide (S 02), nitrogen oxides (NO,), and particulate matter (PM). Also ready is a new generation of technologies that can produce electricity and other commodities, such as steam and synthetic gas, and provide efficiencies and environmental performance responsive to global climate change concerns. The CCT Program took a pollution prevention approach as well, demonstrating technologies that remove pollutants or their precursors from coal-based fuels before combustion. Finally, new technologies were introduced into the major coal-based industries, such as steel production, to enhance environmental performance. Thanks in part to the CCT Program, coal [...] abundant, secure, and economical [...] can continue in its role as a key component in the U. S. and world energy markets. The CCT Program also has global importance in providing clean, efficient coal-based technology to a burgeoning energy market in developing countries largely dependent on coal.
