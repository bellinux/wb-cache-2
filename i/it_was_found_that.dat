5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study examined the}} effects on the Antarctic scallop {{of an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E

5|$|A fold of semi-wild Highland cattle was studied, over {{a period}} of 4 years. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the cattle have a clear {{structure}} and hierarchy of dominance, which reduced aggression.

Playfighting, licking and mounting were seen as friendly contact.|$|E
