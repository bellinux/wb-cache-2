She later took up residence with a <b>furniture</b> <b>remover,</b> Frank Hogg, who had at least one other lover, Phoebe Styles. Styles became pregnant, and Hogg married her at Pearcey's urging. They lived in Kentish Town in London. Styles gave birth to a daughter also named Phoebe Hogg.|$|E

Not leaving the heroic line until relatively late {{he won a}} new popularity in elder roles also on TV. Perhaps his most popular one was as the blustering and intolerant but yet sympathetic <b>furniture</b> <b>remover</b> Olsen in the series Huset på Christianshavn ("The House on Christianshavn").

She was perplexed by this, and stood for some seconds in the empty street hesitating, until the appearance of another circumspect woman under the street lamp at the corner reassured her. In one of the big gates was a little door, and she rapped at this. It was immediately opened by a man with light eyelashes and a manner suggestive of restrained passion.

After getting involved in petty crime, he got into serious trouble {{for the first time}} after crashing a stolen lorry into a car. He ran 90 mi away from the scene to his parents' home, where he was apprehended. The driver of the car survived the collision so Bronson got off lightly, receiving yet more fines and probation. After his trial, he returned to petty crimes and menial labour. In 1972, he married Irene Kelsey, with whom he had a son, Michael Jonathan, later the same year. At the age of 19, he was convicted for his part in a smash and grab raid, but was given one last chance by the judge, who gave him a suspended sentence.|$|E
40|$|The paper directs {{attention}} to and criticizes an unexamined metaphor that dominates {{talk about the}} translation of the Treaty of Waitangi. Key terms in the Treaty, such as ‘Sovereignty ’ and ‘Property’, are commonly talked about as if they point to entities in the world, observable by us independently of the talk about them. The activity of ‘translating ’ the Treaty, in this schema, is talked {{about in terms of}} ‘conveying ’ bits of meaning over from English to Maori, ultimately replacing one set of labels with another. Treaty translator Rev. Henry Williams has been repeatedly judged, implicitly or explicitly, some-thing of a failure in his supposed task of ‘conveying ’ cum re-labeling meaning. But meaning, I submit, is always meaning to someone, who is uniquely located in some context. What the Treaty means to one person, with their particular set of experiences and expectations, will of necessity be in some degree dif-ferent from all others. Justly judging Williams requires that we let go of the ‘conveying ’ metaphor. A new metaphor may enable us to see the Treaty and Williams quite differently; it may stimulate new questions and create new understandings. ‘On the 4 th of February, about 4 o’clock p. m., ’ Rev. Henry Williams wrote in his Early Recollections, ‘Captain Hobson came to me with the Treaty of Waitangi in English, for me to translate into Maori, saying he would meet me in the morning at the House of the British Resident, Mr. Busby; when it must be read to the chiefs assembled at 0 o’clock. ’ It has often been expressed or implied that Williams ’ translation of the Treaty into Maori is unfaithful to the English text. Many of his critics, however, use and talk about the words in the Treaty texts as though they contain solid meanings, like the way furniture resides in homes – securely ‘there ’ where a reader can see and grasp them the way we can see and grasp tables and chairs. This view of words is associated with a view of a translator as someone akin to a <b>furniture</b> <b>remover,</b> who picks furniture (meanings) up from one home and transports it to another home.
