Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) combines modern laser spectroscopy with the exciting optical properties of metallic structures, resulting in strongly increased Raman signals when molecules {{are attached to}} micrometersized structures.

5000|$|A {{crankcase}} heater is an electrical component in a compressor in an air-conditioning system, heat pump system, or chiller system. The {{crankcase heater}} is normally {{on all the}} time, even when the unit is not running, though temperature sensors and set points may turn it off when not needed. A crankcase heater's sole purpose is to prevent refrigerant migration and mixing with crankcase oil when the unit is off, and to prevent condensation of refrigerant in the crankcase of a compressor. The crankcase heater keeps refrigerant at a temperature higher than the coldest part of the system. A crankcase heater generally has the same electrical symbol as a resistor because it converts electricity directly into heat via electrical resistance. The resistance in the <b>heater</b> <b>coil</b> determines the heat it produces when voltage is applied.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of thermal {{overload}} relay. In one type, a bi-metallic strip located close to a heater deflects as the heater temperature rises until it mechanically causes the device to trip and open the circuit, cutting power to the motor should it become overloaded. A thermal overload will accommodate the brief high starting current of a motor while accurately protecting it from a running current overload. The <b>heater</b> <b>coil</b> and the action of the bi-metallic strip introduce a time delay that affords the motor time to start and settle into normal running current without the thermal overload tripping. Thermal overloads can be manually or automatically resettable depending on their application and have an adjuster that allows them to be accurately set to the motor run current.|$|E

Analysis of a previous design of a radio-frequency (~ 0. 5 MHz) coil demonstrated that the center of 13 mm diameter shock wave experiment sample discs were underheated and the experimental temperatures achieved resulted from conduction of heat from the overheated sample edges relative {{to the center of}} the sample. We show, using the Biot-Savant law, that the ratio of magnetic field in the center to that at the edge of the sample, f, can be maximized to a value of f= 1. 8, by decreasing the radius of the <b>heater</b> <b>coil,</b> relative to the 13 mm diameter of sample. A simple analysis provides the thermal gradient across the sample thickness. An electric skin depth for iron of ~ 1 mm for the 0. 45 MHz frequency of the heater power supply of our system is obtained.

40|$|A {{proof of}} concept of the {{possibility}} to estimate thermal conductivity of bulk disc samples at room temperature by means of thermal decays is demonstrated. An experimental set-up was designed and fabricated, which is able to perform thermal transient measurements by using a specially designed multifunctional probe that {{has the ability to}} measure temperature at its tip. Initially, the probe is heated by a <b>heater</b> <b>coil</b> located in its interior until the tip temperature reaches a steady state. Then, the probe is contacted with a disc sample which produces a temperature decay until a new state is reached. The difference between the initial and final states temperatures shows a correlation with the thermal conductivity of the sample. Employing a calibration equation, obtained using reference materials, the thermal conductivity can be calculated. Reasonably good random and systematic errors (< 13 % and ~ 9 % respectively) are obtained. Theoretical simulations performed using COMSOL show a good qualitative agreement with experimental results.

Apparatus By combining the Benedict and Fox (1925) oxycalorimeter and the Benedict universal metabolism apparatus and introducing a more effective cooler, one is enabled to obtain accurate respiratory quotients upon the combustion of small amounts of thoroughly dried plant or animal material.

There are many interacting parameters that affect the heater performance and contribute to its cost. Such parameters are coil length, coil diameter, the helix diameter, the number of turns, the coil emissivity, the heater wall emissivity, the applied voltage, the air flow rate, the air temperature at the heater outlet, and the heater dimensions. The <b>heater</b> <b>coil</b> was divided into four segments and the heater wall was divided into five sections. Energy and heat transfer equations were written for each segment of the coil, each section of the wall, and the air past each coil segment.

50|$|Electric {{utilities}} {{have discovered}} that this basic principle can save utility companies, and their customers, {{a significant amount of}} money. Utilities are able to shave the peak of their power demand curves by reducing the voltage across their distribution system. When a utility reaches a point where power demand is expected to exceed supply, utilities only have two options. Either purchase power from another utility, usually at substantial prices, or reduce demand. Often utilities use load management systems to turn off customers' air conditioners, water heaters, and pool pumps to reduce demand. Voltage reduction has become another option for utilities to reduce demand - typically unbeknownst to the customer. However, only the resistive portion of the load responds to the reduction in voltage to reduce aggregate demand. Loads such as incandescent lights and <b>heater</b> <b>coils</b> will use less power as the voltage is lowered. On the other hand, induction motor loads are unaffected by the reduction in voltage, because the current simply rises to account for no change or even a slight increase in power consumption.|$|R

40|$|This thesis reports an {{investigation}} into the design of converters for induction heating systems based upon resonant switch mode power converter techniques. The proposed three phase unity power factor induction heating system consists of two stages of power conversions. The important requirements for each stage of the power conversion of a typical induction heating system working from a three-phase supply are identified. A wide range of power converters which fulfil these requirements are compared and evaluated. From the evaluation, the most applicable converter topologies are selected. Each selected converter class is investigated in great detail to outline their advantages and disadvantages. The first stage consists of a push-pull buck converter connected to a unity power factor rectifier stage. This stage converts the three phase AC mains supply to a required DC value. The second stage, which converters the DC into AC is a single ended resonant inverter system. Analysis of the converters has been made and the design procedure has been formulated. The design procedure allows a strenuous design of each resonant converter for particular converter applications. The final converter design has been simulated using the circuit simulation software packages Design Architect and Accusim to verify the results of analysis. The most important design and construction achievements can be summarised as follows: I A novel push-pull buck quasi-resonant converter with a three-phase rectifier stage has been built and tested. At its maximum operating frequency of 40 kHz, the prototype converter delivers an output power of 500 W. The converter draws nearly sinusoidal currents from the three-phase mains supply and has an input power factor approaching unity. A secondary stage resonant converter provides AC for the induction <b>heater</b> <b>coil.</b> This AC current flowing in the induction coil creates an alternating electromagnetic field for the workpiece. An induction heating coil has been designed and built by using electrical equivalent coil design method. A novel control strategy was developed to provide output power control. Both converter and inverter stage of the system are operated in the zero-current switching condition. The use of this technique allows higher switching frequencies and provides low switching losses. The full design details are presented along with simulation and practical results. The simulation and practical performance results presented show good correlation with theoretical predictions...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{internal}} pressure experienced by a gas tar-get during irradiation {{is dependent on}} the beam energy deposited in the target, the beam cur-rent, and the thermal behaviour of the target. [1] The maximum beam energy deposited {{is a function of the}} cyclotron capabilities and the gas inventory within the target. The maximum beam current is limited by the pressure produced in the target and the ability of the target assembly to remain intact. This is also a function of the thermal behaviour of the target, which is difficult to predict a priori since it is dependent on such things as convection currents that occur during irradiation. We conducted bench tests with model gas targets with and without forced convection currents to observe the effect on thermal behaviour. Based on those results we constructed a prototype gas target, suitable for irradiation, with an internal fan assembly that is rotated via external magnets. Material and Methods Bench tests were conducted with cylindrical and conical target bodies of aluminum. A nickel-chromium heater wire was inserted into the gas volume through the normal beam entrance port (FIGURE 1) to heat the gas while water cooling was applied to the target body. The voltage and current of the <b>heater</b> <b>coil</b> was monitored along with the pressure inside the target and the water inlet and outlet temperature. In the case of tests with a driven fan blade either the voltage applied to the electric motor was monitored or the fan speed itself was recorded. By assuming the ideal gas law, the pressure gives the average bulk temperature and a global heat transfer coefficient can be calculated between the target gas and the cooling water. [2] A cylindrical target body was constructed that incorporated a fan blade driven by an external motor. This assembly used a simple o-ring seal on the rotating shaft. This seal was not robust enough for any tests under beam conditions. A prototype design suitable for in-beam operation employs a propeller mounted on a rotating disc housing two samarium cobalt magnets and spinning on two micro-bearings which are constructed to operate in high temperature environments. The micro-bearings are mounted on a pin projecting from a plate welded to the back of the gas target to allow assembly of the fan mechanism prior to attachment to the body (FIGURE 2) ...|$|E

Therefore, LLNL in collaboration with Cal Poly has designed and built a Mini High Temperature Testing Unit (MHTTU) to recreate conditions observed during a fire and to test different materials in an effective, inexpensive, regulated and reliable method. The existing prototype was unable to achieve the ideal testing conditions of 1000 °F air at the low flow rates of 1. 25 - 12 ACFM; therefore, this project looks to optimize previous efforts on building a portable and reliable MHTTU to collect more information and perform different tests in various materials utilized {{in the construction of}} ceramic HEPA filters. Based on previous teams’ inputs, our team performed a heat transfer analysis to determine critical heat loss points and to optimize the design of the MHTTU. After several idea generation sessions, it was decided to modified the geometry of the testing chamber and the insulation of the system. The MHTTU also lacks a robust control system and a user interface; therefore, a more reliable interface and more versatility during the tests were implemented in the system. With the current design, we were able to improve the maximum temperature of the system to 837 °F; however, {{we were not able to}} fulfill heat up time of 15 minutes.

50|$|Chilled fog {{machines}} {{are designed to}} create thick clouds of fog that lie {{close to the ground}} and dissipate as they rise. They are typically created by using either dry ice, liquid nitrogen, or more recently liquid air.Dry Ice (solid carbon dioxide) effects are produced by heating water to or near boiling in a suitable container (for example: a 55-gallon drum with water <b>heater</b> <b>coils</b> in it), and then dropping in one or more pieces of dry ice. Because at standard temperature and pressure carbon dioxide is a gas, the carbon dioxide sublimates and instantly produces a gas, condensing water vapor and creating a thick white fog. A fan placed {{at the top of the}} container directs the fog where it is needed.Liquid nitrogen (N2) is used to create low lying fog effects in a manner similar to dry ice. A machine heats water to at or near the boiling point, creating steam and increasing the humidity in a closed container. When liquid nitrogen is pumped into the container, the moisture rapidly condenses, creating a thick white fog. A fan placed at the output of the container directs the fog where it is needed, creating a rolling fog that lies low to the ground.Liquid air is an alternative to using liquid nitrogen in generating low lying fog effects. Liquid air is composed of N2 and O2 mixed in a ratio of 79% nitrogen and 21% oxygen stored as a liquid in insulated cylinders. This ratio of nitrogen to oxygen is the same as that of atmospheric air, and indeed liquid air may be fabricated by simply liquefying atmospheric air. Liquid air can be used as a direct replacement for liquid nitrogen in chilled-fog effects and is intended to be used in the same manner in the same equipment. Its key advantage over liquid nitrogen is that it presents no asphyxiation hazard, since it contains oxygen. A disadvantage is that it supports combustion, whereas liquid nitrogen inhibits combustion.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Deformation {{of glass}} using heat occurs in many {{industrial}} and artistic applications, including the manufacturing of laboratory glass products, drawing of fiber optics, and hand-blown artistic creations. The formation of glass objects is an art, but the trial-and-error {{aspect of the}} procedures can be reduced by development of a systematic theory, especially when the objects are formed using mechanical means. Glass microelectrodes are ubiquitous in experimental studies of the electrophysiology of biological cells and their membranes, and the “pulling ” of these electrodes is based on trial-and-error. To make this process more systematic, we derive a model for glass microelectrode formation using a <b>coil</b> <b>heater</b> with a gravity-forced electrode puller, assuming that the glass tube is an incompressible, viscous fluid. The model is one-dimensional, {{and the effects of}} thermal radiation from the <b>coil</b> <b>heater</b> are essential in the formation process. A breaking stress criterion is imposed to fracture the glass tube, forming the electrode tip. The difficulty with the moving free end is avoided by introducing a quasi-Lagrangian coordinate system. The model equations are solved using an adaptive moving grid to account for the local stretching of the glass. A number of examples using a double-pull paradigm have been computed to illustrate the dependence of the electrode shape and tip diameter on the heater temperature and the ratio between the inner and outer radii...|$|R
