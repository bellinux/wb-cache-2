25|$|In {{spite of}} the success, the design also {{demonstrated}} several serious problems. In particular, the <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>platform</b> had to be leveled out before use using several spirit levels, and then checked and repeatedly reset for accuracy.

If the gyros were found to be off, the leveling procedure took as long as eight and a half minutes. Other minor problems were the direct current electric motors which drove the gyroscopes, whose brushes wore down quickly and left carbon dust throughout the interior of the device, and the positioning of the control knobs, which meant the bombardier could only adjust side-to-side or up-and-down aim at a time, not both. But in spite of all of these problems, the Mark XV was so superior to any other design that the Navy ordered it into production.|$|E
50|$|An {{inertial}} platform, {{also known}} as a <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>platform</b> or stabilized platform, is a system using gyroscopes to maintain a platform in a fixed orientation in space despite the movement of the vehicle that it is attached to. These can then be used to stabilize gunsights in tanks, anti-aircraft artillery on ships, and as the basis for older mechanically-based inertial navigation systems.|$|E

This resulted {{in the development of a}} Miniature Fiber-Optic Gyroscope, with three orthogonal axes, to provide the necessary information for on-board computers and ensuring missile accuracy. The design of this subsystem was conducted by IEAv (Institute of Advanced Studies of DCTA) and Mectron.|$|E

Helmut Hölzer and Ernst Steinhoff accepted the Operation Paperclip invitation to the United States, traveled there in late 1945, and maintained contact with Haeussermann. Haeussermann came to the United States in 1947 to rejoin von Braun's team, working on ballistic missile guidance and control engineering at Fort Bliss.

40|$|Bobsleigh is {{a winter}} sport in which teams make timed runs down narrow, twisting, banked, iced tracks in gravity-powered sleds. To {{win the race}} it is of great {{importance}} to have a sled that is optimized from both the sliding and the aerodynamic point of view. However, also typical vehicle parameters, such as the weight distribution and the inclination of the steering axis, play an important role. In fact, being the friction coefficient between skates and ice very small (approx. 0. 04), an change in the weight acting on the front skates may significantly modify the steering feedback of the driver thus highlighting his/her driving ability. Better trajectories imply less corrections on the steering axis and thus better performances. The inclination of the steering axis, instead, generates a torque similar to the self-aligning torque produced by road vehicle tires thus stabilizing the front skates and requiring less control ac-tions to the sled driver. Up to now, bobsleigh design {{has been carried out}} mainly {{on the basis of the}} feedback of ath-letes. The drawback of this approach is that it leads to small modifications in the bobsleigh design and it does not allow to objectively identify the influence of the applied modifica-tions/innovative solutions on the bobsleigh overall performance. To be able to quantify the influence of certain design changes on the performance of bob-sleighs, it was decided to set up a multi-body model of a two-men sled. To validate the nu-merical model an experimental campaign with an instrumented bobsleigh was carried out at Cesana Pariol Olympic Park. During the tests, the bobsleigh was instrumented with two iner-tial <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>platforms</b> to measure the dynamics of the two frames constituting the bob-sleigh body, sixteen strain gauge channels to measure the ice-skates contact forces, one optical sensor to measure the bobsleigh speed and one potentiometer to measure the steer an-gle imposed by the driver. Numerical results have shown a good agreement with the experi-mental data...|$|R

Up to now, the {{optimization}} of bobsleighs {{has been carried}} out on the basis of athletes feedback. This has led to small modifications of the sled without univocal guidelines. This paper presents the results of an experimental campaign carried out at Cesana Pariol Olympic track with an instrumented two man bobsleigh.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} <b>gyroscopic</b> {{stabilization}} of <b>platform.</b> The platform consists of parallelogram, cardan frame and two contra- rotating gyroscopes. The whole system is described with five generalized coordinates and with two cyclic coordinates. We created {{a prototype of}} platform, which rotate around one axis. The prototype is designed {{with respect to a}} simple way to extend the rotation about the second axis and paralelogram. The rotary frame is driven by the gyroscope. Pneumatic motors are used to actuating gyroscopes. Pneumatic springs are used to actuating rotating frame.

50|$|These {{systems are}} all remote {{controlled}} <b>gyroscopic</b> assisted stabilizing <b>platforms.</b> They utilize {{a series of}} spinning fly wheels and electronics to dampen the angular disturbances. They are mostly used for helicopter work but {{can also be used}} for camera car, crane, or suspended cable systems. The A-1 systems do not have steerability of the roll (dutch) axis, only horizon leveling. These systems as well as the (A), will eliminate almost all of the angular disturbances. The drawback is that the (A-1) systems are closed architecture systems. The DP can only utilize the offered one or two cameras and lens combinations, normally a Mitchell R35 camera and a 10:1 zoom lens.|$|R

40|$|The present work {{is focused}} on ship’s {{parametric}} roll. In particular, a series of controlled experiments have been performed {{in order to obtain}} repeatable results both for the inception and the roll amplitude in parametric roll condition. The experiments have been performed for an innovative ship design (a tumblehome shape) in a towing tank provided by a flap-type wave maker. The model was tested in 3 DoF conditions, being roll, pitch and heave motions free and surge, sway and yaw restrained. The experimental work, which is the subject of the present paper, is part of cooperative research project between the IIHR (Iowa Institute of Hydraulic Research), the University of Trieste and the Italian ship model basin (INSEAN) (1, 2). All the experiments have been carried out in head waves at the INSEAN basin n. 2. The model motions were measured both by an optical motion tracker (Krypton) and a <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>platform</b> (MOTAN). Tests were carried out for three different metacentric heights in a range of speeds. Roll decay tests as a function of forward speed were before every experiment in waves {{in order to determine the}} natural roll frequency and the roll decay rate. The head waves experiments showed parametric roll excitation for different metacentric heights, wave steepness and Froude number. The repeatability of the obtained results, allows to use them as a benchmark for both CFD codes and theoretical models. This will be the subject of a future work, which is at present in preparation and involves other international collaborations beyond the ones listed here...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was is to measure motions and {{accelerations}} that a vessel, during adverse sea weather conditions, suffers and produces on the subjects on board, in order to evaluate the effects on their loss of balance. A distinctive and innovative aspect {{of the study was}} to have based the research not on a simulation, for example through the use of a mechanized platform and manikins, but to have chosen a real measurement through the use of electronic instruments, partly designed for this purpose, suitable for measuring motions and accelerations of the vessel, and contemporaneously the acceleration suffered by a subject on board and free to move. The survey of the vessel acceleration and that felt by the person was carried out respectively through an inertial <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>platform</b> and a wireless triaxial accelerometer provided with MEMS sensors. This method, which provides the possibility of monitoring the vessel over a long time (a whole season) and during adverse sea weather conditions, allowed us to obtain a complete and valid data base formed by the combined action of the boat (accelerations and motions) and the system of forces felt by the subjects on board. This system of forces is the one mainly responsible for the physical stress and loss of balance in the sailor, so we can understand how this combined method of measurement, and true of the vessel motions and accelerations suffered by the worker’s body, since it allows us to identify the limit conditions which lead to loss of balance, can be used in the arrangement of measures, to guarantee the safety of the sailo...|$|E
40|$|AbstractResearch in road users’ {{behaviour}} typically {{depends on}} detailed observational data availability, {{particularly if the}} interest is in driving behaviour modelling. Among this type of data, vehicle trajectories are {{an important source of}} information for traffic flow theory, driving behaviour modelling, innovation in traffic management and safety and environmental studies. Recent developments in sensing technologies and image processing algorithms reduced the resources (time and costs) required for detailed traffic data collection, promoting the feasibility of site-based and vehicle-based naturalistic driving observation. For testing the core models of a traffic microsimulation application for safety assessment, vehicle trajectories were collected by remote sensing on a typical Portuguese suburban motorway. Multiple short flights over a stretch of an urban motorway allowed for the collection of several partial vehicle trajectories. In this paper the technical details of each step of the methodology used is presented: image collection, image processing, vehicle identification and vehicle tracking. To collect the images, a high-resolution camera was mounted on an aircraft's <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>platform.</b> The camera was connected to a DGPS for extraction of the camera position and allowed the collection of high resolution images at a low frame rate of 2 s. After generic image orthorrectification using the flight details and the terrain model, computer vision techniques were used for fine rectification: the scale-invariant feature transform algorithm was used for detection and description of image features, and the random sample consensus algorithm for feature matching. Vehicle detection was carried out by median-based background subtraction. After the computation of the detected foreground and the shadow detection using a spectral ratio technique, region segmentation was used to identify candidates for vehicle positions. Finally, vehicles were tracked using a k- shortest disjoints paths algorithm. This approach allows for the optimization of an entire set of trajectories against all possible position candidates using motion-based optimization. Besides the importance of a new trajectory dataset that allows the development of new behavioural models and the validation of existing ones, this paper also describes the application of state-of-the-art algorithms and methods that significantly minimize the resources needed for such data collection...|$|E
