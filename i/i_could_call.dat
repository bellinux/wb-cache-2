It is also the second of three songs on the album which lyrics point to anguish ("Remember those times <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> / Through the clear day time / And you would be there"). The theme of weather is {{referenced}} again ("The softness, the warmth and the weather in suspense"). The song also references the Cambridge quarry pits, and the landscape.|$|E
500|$|Speaking for MTV News, Jay-Z {{responded to}} Braxton's claims: [...] "I wouldn't {{want to take}} it from her. I don't even think like that. My first thought would be, 'Maybe <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> her up, maybe I could get on that record.' The most obvious [...] is it's neither one of our records. It's not like you made an {{original}} idea. She's not in hip-hop, but it happens in hip-hop often. We go to sample the same thing and my record came out first. I'm sorry. What can I do?" [...] He went on saying that if he had known they were both planning to sample the same Tupac song, he would have arranged a duet with her.|$|E
500|$|Scott Boras has {{represented}} Holliday as his agent since he turned professional. [...] Holliday described {{his relationship with}} Boras and his staff in that he [...] "enjoy(s) sitting down and talking to them. [...] Scott is as accessible as {{you want him to}} be.

[...] Holliday further explained that due to the amenities the Boras Corporation provides, including a staff psychologist, research to assist players in prolonging careers, studies into arbitration cases, and statistical performance computation, he felt that Boras' agency gave him the best opportunities to succeed.|$|E

500|$|Docter {{noted that}} the film {{reflects}} his friendships with Disney veterans Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Joe Grant (who all died before the film's release and thus the film was dedicated to them). Grant gave the script his approval {{as well as some}} advice before his death in 2005. Docter recalled that Grant would remind him that the audience needed an [...] "emotional bedrock" [...] because of how wacky the adventure would become; here it is Carl mourning for his wife. Docter felt that Grant's personality influenced Carl's deceased wife Ellie more than the grouchy main character, and Carl was primarily based on Spencer Tracy, Walter Matthau, James Whitmore, and their own grandparents, because there was [...] "something sweet about these grumpy old guys". Docter and Jonas Rivera noted Carl's charming nature in spite of his grumpiness derives from the elderly [...] "hav this charm and almost this 'old man license' to say things that other people couldn't get away with [...] It's like how we would go to eat with Joe Grant and he would call the waitresses 'honey'. I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> a waitress 'honey'." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{is one of}} {{the most}} anthologized, and controversial, essays of the postwar period. Mailer republished it in 1959 in his {{miscellany}} Advertisements for Myself which he described as [...] "The first work I wrote with a style <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> my own." [...] The reviews were positive, and most commentators referred to it as his breakthrough work.|$|E
2500|$|I {{thought that}} I was leaving for ever the fair island of my home, {{with all that}} had made it dear in dearer days.

If there was one thing in the world Allen lived and breathed for, it was to fight. He had been all shot up in the last war, and he seemed not the least averse to getting shot up again. This was no intellectual war with him. He hated Germans and Italians like vermin." ...|$|E

2500|$|On Monday, March 2, 1970, in Keene, New Hampshire, a Weatherman {{purchased}} two 50-pound {{cases of}} dynamite from the New England Explosives Corporation.

Oughton left Detroit and joined the group at the house. [...] On Friday of the same week, Oughton and Robbins were in the basement assembling a nail bomb when it detonated.

2500|$|On {{his return}} to California, London {{was unable to find}} work and relied on odd jobs such as cutting grass.

[...] A few years later, London wrote a short story about a dog named Bâtard who, {{at the end of the}} story, kills his master. London sold the piece to Cosmopolitan Magazine, which published it in the June 1902 issue under the title [...] "Diablo— A Dog". London's biographer, Earle Labor, says that London then began work on The Call of the Wild to [...] "redeem the species" [...] from his dark characterization of dogs in [...] "Bâtard".

6000|$|I began now {{to regret}} more bitterly than ever the having fooled away my family property, {{the care and}} {{improvement}} of which I saw might have afforded an agreeable employment for my leisure, which only went to brood on past misfortunes, and increase useless repining.
