40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} to measure the spectra of gamma radiation emitted in cascade disintegrations. Use is made of a two-crystal scintillation spectrometer and a gated multi-channel analysing device. The pulses produced by summing the outputs of the two crystal-photomultiplier combinations are selected by a single-channel <b>differential</b> <b>discriminator.</b> The output of this <b>differential</b> <b>discriminator</b> gates the multi-channel analyser whenever the sum pulse corresponds to the release in the crystals of the full energy available in the cascade.

40|$|Abstract–Few {{people have}} studied the problem of {{physiological}} data transmission at the rates required by NASA’s Life Sciences-Advanced BioTelemetry System (LS-ABTS). Implanted telemetry eliminates {{the problems associated with}} wire breaking the skin, and permits experiments with awake and unrestrained subjects. Our goal is to build a low-power 174 - 216 MHz RF transmitter suitable for short range biosensor and implantable use. A system architecture based on a frequency-locked loop frequency synthesizer is presented, and a novel <b>differential</b> frequency <b>discriminator</b> that eliminates the need for a frequency divider is also proposed. The Hajimiri phase noise model was used to optimize the VCO for minimum power consumption. A test chip was fabricated in a 0. 5 Pm, 3 V CMOS process.

40|$|In this work, low effort {{architectures}} for Internet of Things (IoT) {{applications are}} proposed to support multiple short-range wireless standards on single die. Appropriate solutions for low power RF transceiver are provided, which emphasize the high-efficient, low-cost, low-power performance but with satisfactory data rate. By comparing the characteristic trade-offs {{of the various}} architectures, analyzing the typical transceiver non-ideality factors and discuss the specifications and requirements of typical short distance standards, the PLL based two-point modulation transmitter and low-IF receiver architectures are selected. In the transmitter design, a current-reuse VCO technique in the frequency synthesizer is presented to significantly reduce the power consumption with excellent phase noise performance. Subsequently a digital architecture for ΣΔ quantizer and noise cancellation is proposed in the PLL modulation loop, which can dramatically reduce the hardware complexity without degrading the Synthesizer performance. To enhance the two-point modulation bandwidth, an adaptive calibration technique for phase noise cancellation based on the modified classical loop filter structure is proposed, where an additional port from the loop filter is used as the reference for the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm to avoid DC offset. The gain mismatch between signal path and noise cancellation path is detected and calibrated outside of the PLL loop without introducing any additional spurs into the system. Comparing to the previous works, the proposed technique provides a straightforward solution for wideband PLL designs, and the quantization noise is successfully eliminated with smaller area and lower power consumption. In the receiver design, the proposed low-power low-effort digital demodulator architecture for low-IF receivers can compensate I/Q mismatch due to the impairment within the frontend, and thus it improves the robustness against interference presented at the image frequency. And the group delay is compensated with a digital IIR based equalizer, which improves the BER performance significantly compared to the original case. In the clock data recovery block, the typical synchronization problems including symbol timing recovery and carrier frequency offset calibration are solved based on a simplified Data-Aided (DA) scheme. The ΣΔ NCO provides wide range IF signals with high resolution and SNR. A Viterbi decoder which uses multi-order <b>differential</b> <b>discriminators</b> provides a robust decoding performance. Hence, it can be demonstrated that the proposed multi-standard receiver architecture not only greatly enhances the performance with wide range data rates and IF frequencies, but also provides an easy, feasible and flexible solution for the fully integrated implementation...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{bandwidth}} efficient constant-amplitude {{digital modulation}} schemes {{have also been}} shown to be power efficient when coherent detection is used. Partial-response continuous phase modulation (CPM) schemes are within this class. In some applications noncoherent detection is preferred. The performance of CPM systems is analyzed for <b>differential</b> and <b>discriminator</b> detection. An additive white Gaussian channel is assumed. The detectors make symbol-by-symbol decisions. The considered schemes are M-ary with an arbitrary modulation index and pulse shaping over several symbol intervals. The performance is analyzed by means of error probability expressions. The IF filter for the detectors is optimized within a special class of filters to give good performance. The differential detector is also analyzed on a Rayleigh fading channel. The fading is assumed to be slow. The IF filter is also optimized on this channel. Simulated error probabilities for discriminator detection with a Viterbi detector are also presented both for the Gaussian and the Rayleigh fading channel. The discriminator detector making symbol-by-symbol decisions is simulated on the Rayleigh fading channel. It is shown that partial-response CPM schemes with good performance can also be obtained with noncoherent detectors...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} design and the test results of a {{front-end}} circuit developed in a 0. 25 mu m CMOS technology. The aim of this work is to study {{the performance of a}} deep submicron process in applications for fast binary front-end for silicon strip detectors. The channel comprises a fast transimpedance preamplifier working with an active feedback loop, two stages of the amplifier-integrator circuits providing 22 ns peaking time and two-stage <b>differential</b> <b>discriminator.</b> Particular effort has been made to minimize the current and the power consumption of the preamplifier, while keeping the required noise and timing performance. For a detector capacitance of 20 pF noise below 1500 e/sup -/ ENC has been achieved for 300 mu A bias current in the input transistor, which is comparable with levels achieved in the past for a front-end using bipolar input transistor.

40|$|Energies and intensities {{have been}} {{measured}} of γ-rays {{produced in the}} 25 Mg(p, γ) 26 Al reaction at six resonances in the region Ep = 0. 3 − 0. 7 MeV. Thin enriched 25 Mg targets were bombarded with protons from a Cockroft-Walton generator, and γ-rays were detected with a scintillation spectrometer. The resulting pulse spectra were analyzed with a <b>differential</b> <b>discriminator</b> and photographed on an oscilloscope screen. The resonances investigated here could be assigned to 25 Mg by comparison with runs on enriched 24 Mg and 26 Mg targets. The 25 Mg resonances are found at 321, 395, 441, 501, 518, 580, 607, 667 and 688, all ± 15 keV. The 501 and 518 keV resonances could not be resolved completely, but they show almost identical γ-ray spectra. The resonances at 667 and 688 keV have not been investigated in detail. The six resonances investigated in detail show complicated γ-ray spectra, different from resonance to resonance. A list of γ-ray energies and intensities is given in Tables II and III. From absolute γ-ray yield measurements the radiation widths of all resonances (multiplied by a statistical factor) could be determined...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis paper reports {{an investigation of}} the distribution of the energy, E, of the secondary electrons released in an organic scintillator by secondary gamma radiation measured {{on the same side of}} a scattering medium as that on which the source is located. The investigation was conducted by scintillation spectrometry using stilbene on an RCA 6199 photomultiplier, and employing the technique of Dr. C. J. Hine. The amplified detector output is analyzed by a <b>differential</b> <b>discriminator</b> of constant window width whose base line is continuously varied mechanically so as to scan the energy spectrum. The output is recorded by a counting rate meter and recording milliameter. Effectively semi-infinite scatterers of wood, aluminum, iron, tin and lead were used. The surface of the scatterer was always horizontal with its centerline always parallel to the source-detector line. The source-detector distance was kept at 40 cm while their distance, y, above the scatterer surface was varied from 0. 5 cm to 90 cm. Essentially all of the secondary gammas originated in the scatterers because collimation was avoided. The primary beam was not excluded from the detector; the energy spectrum of the primary obtained with no scatterer was subtracted from that obtained with the scatterer in place. The difference was plotted. These data were presented in various ways to show the counting rate as a function of the other three prime variables, E, Y, and Z (atomic number of the scatterer). Auxiliary experiments were run in the same manner measuring effects of reducing the surface area of a scatterer, changing the primary gamma-ray energy from the mean od 1. 25 Mev from Co(60) to 0. 663 Mev from Cs (137), and changing the thickness of one of the scatterers. A qualitative discussion is presented for each part of the investigation, explaining as far as possible the significant features of the data ssuch as maxima and cariations in intensity observed, and attempting to correlate them with the prime variables. A relation to the density of the scatterers is also inferred. By consideration of the angular distribution shown is Compton-Rayleigh scattering, and by taking into account the absorption of the scattered gammas by photoelectric effect in high Z materials, satisfactory explanations are found for most of the observed phenomena on the basis of existing knowledge. A few features, however, require further observations for verification and clarification. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
