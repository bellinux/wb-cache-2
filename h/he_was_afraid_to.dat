5|$|Stein Arvid Huseby, {{originally}} from Karmøy, {{was at the}} time 24 years old. He had just finished studying at a Christian upper secondary school in Trondheim. He had previously been sentenced five times for violence offenses, including an armed robbery of a taxi and threatening a lensmann with a shotgun. He was beaten and abused by his father, and started drinking as a 13-year-old. He lost his job as a seaman due to drunkenness, and was put into a psychiatric institution in 1980, aged 19. In 1983, he was admitted to a Christian school, and had managed to stay away from alcohol for two years, but had started again just prior to the incident. He stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> lose his friends due to his misuse of alcohol.|$|E

25|$|Herbert Hoover {{had already}} {{considered}} a bank holiday {{to prevent further}} bank runs, but rejected the idea because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> trip a panic. Roosevelt, however, gave a radio address, held in the atmosphere of a Fireside Chat, and explained {{to the public in}} simple terms the causes of the banking crisis, what the government will do and how the population could help. He closed all the banks in the country and kept them all closed until he could pass new legislation.|$|E

25|$|Warhol died in Manhattan at 6:32a.m. on February 22, 1987. According to news reports, he {{had been}} making a good {{recovery}} from gallbladder surgery at New York Hospital before dying in his sleep from a sudden post-operative cardiac arrhythmia. Prior to his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> enter hospitals and see doctors. His family sued the hospital for inadequate care, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and water intoxication. The malpractice case was quickly settled out of court; Warhol's family received an undisclosed sum of money.|$|E
25|$|Hoover {{had already}} {{considered}} a bank holiday {{to prevent further}} bank runs, but rejected the idea because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> trip a panic. Roosevelt acted {{as soon as he}} took office; he closed all the banks in the country and kept them all closed until he could pass new legislation. On March 9, Roosevelt sent to Congress the Emergency Banking Act, drafted in large part by Hoover's top advisors. The act was passed and signed into law the same day. It provided for a system of reopening sound banks under Treasury supervision, with federal loans available if needed. Three-quarters of the banks in the Federal Reserve System reopened within the next three days. Billions of dollars in hoarded currency and gold flowed back into them within a month, thus stabilizing the banking system. By the end of 1933, 4,004 small local banks were permanently closed and merged into larger banks. Their deposits totalled $3.6 billion; depositors lost a total of $540 million, and eventually received on average 85 cents on the dollar of their deposits; it is a common myth that they received nothing back. The Glass–Steagall Act limited commercial bank securities activities and affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms to regulate speculations. It also established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which insured deposits for up to $250,000, ended the risk of runs on banks.|$|E

500|$|Noreen's {{family has}} {{received}} threats and {{has gone into}} hiding. Ashiq, her husband, stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> let their children go outside. He also expressed concern about how Noreen would be kept safe should she be released, saying, [...] "No one will let her live. The mullahs are saying they will kill her when she comes out." [...] Her family declined {{to leave the country}} while she remained in prison, but Italy, France, and Spain all offered to grant her and her family asylum in the event of her release.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} his testimony, Green {{told the}} court that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> load {{ammunition}} because of [...] "them officers racing each division to see who put on the most tonnage, and I knowed the way they was handling ammunition it was liable to go off again. If we didn't want to work fast at that time, they wanted to put us in the brig, and when the exec came down on the docks, they wanted us to slow up." [...] This was the first that the newspaper reporters had heard of speed and tonnage competition between divisions at Port Chicago, and each reporter filed a story featuring this revelation to be published the next day. Naval authorities quickly issued a statement denying Green's allegation.|$|E
500|$|The band's follow-up, Even If It Kills Me (2007), was {{recorded}} in New York City with Eli Janney and Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne, and Ric Ocasek of the Cars. The group, though big fans of his work, were disappointed with Ocasek's role. [...] "He just confused me the whole time," [...] said Pierre later, who noted that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> disclose that the experience was a [...] "bum-out." [...] Pierre struggled with writer's block during the sessions and found himself writing lyrics while recording the songs, which he had never done before. The band was also worried their songs would not be catchy enough after their last album was so successful. During this time, Pierre's substance abuse nearly disbanded the group. [...] "I think it's an understatement {{to say it is}} tough to be tied to Justin's emotions," [...] Cain later remarked. Following completion of the album, Pierre entered a three-week rehabilitation program for alcohol and drug abuse. The band was apart for a six-week stretch in the summer of 2007, marking their longest break apart in five years. [...] "It might sound cliched, but we all had a chance to do some growing up," [...] said Cain.|$|E

2500|$|Sam Houston, {{leading the}} Texan Army, {{also decided to}} {{strategically}} retreat from Gonzales after learning of the defeat at the Alamo. [...] On hearing of the government's flight, [...] "Houston was pained and annoyed", maintaining it was a cowardly action that caused {{a great deal of}} unnecessary panic. [...] Burnet was infuriated by Houston's criticism and accused Houston of staging his own retreat because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> fight. Within several days, Burnet had stationed a spy, Major James H. Perry, on Houston's staff. [...] In an effort to discredit Houston, Perry initiated a groundless rumor that Houston had begun taking opium.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Weitz {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the story of Grandma long before he began writing the script. He never completed the story until he had met and worked with Tomlin on the 2013 film Admission, saying that [...] "After meeting Lily, the voice and the character really clicked, I had thought about it for years, so I had a lot of it worked out in my head, and then I just went to a coffee shop and wrote it longhand." [...] He said that, as he wrote, he could hear her [...] "performing it in [...] head". After writing the script, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> present it to Tomlin in case she turned down the lead role. Tomlin said that she immediately connected with the character and the story; she and Weitz then spent several months editing the script together. The film marked Tomlin's first leading role in 27 years, after co-starring with Bette Midler in the 1988 comedy film Big Business.|$|E

2500|$|Estimates {{are that}} at least eighty people knew about Brown's planned raid in advance. [...] Many others had reasons to believe that Brown was contemplating a move against the South. [...] One of those who knew was David J. Gue of Springdale, Iowa. [...] Gue was a Quaker who {{believed}} that Brown and his men would be killed. [...] Gue, his brother, and another man decided to warn the government [...] "to protect Brown {{from the consequences of}} his own rashness." [...] Gue sent an anonymous letter dated August 20, 1859 to Secretary of War John B. Floyd. The letter said that [...] "old John Brown, late of Kansas," [...] was planning to organize a slave uprising in the South. [...] It said that Brown had a secret agent [...] "in an armory" [...] in Maryland. [...] The letter said that Brown was stockpiling weapons at a secret location in Maryland. [...] Gue warned that Brown planned to leave Maryland and enter Virginia at Harpers Ferry. [...] Gue acknowledged that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> disclose his identity but asked Floyd not to ignore his warning [...] "on that account."

2500|$|As {{recounted in}} his 1952 memoir Witness, Whittaker Chambers {{came to know}} Lore because they both {{reported}} to rezident Markin: [...] He described him as follows: [...] Lore was an old Bolshevik. He had been a Socialist before the Russian Revolution. In those pre-revolutionary days, {{he had been the}} friend of Trotsky, then a New York Socialist journalist. After the Revolution, Lore had managed an American speaking trip for Alexandra Kollontai, the author of Red Love, later the Soviet ambassador to Sweden. [...] Bukharin, in his New York days, had eaten and slept in the apartment on 55th Street in Brooklyn, where Lore, his outspokenly anti-Communist wife and three wholly American sons still lived. [...] He describes the Lore family with some detail: [...] I was introduced to Lillian Lore, Ludwig's remarkable wife, who in large part provided those meals, and, by some economic miracle, had kept that amazing household together during the long, lean years, had fed the endless procession of guests. [...] "Die unvergessliche Lores-the unforgettable Lores," [...] a German friend had called them... I have seldom seen a happy family life so explicit in the characters of all who shared it... I soon came to regard the Lores' house as a kind of second home. [...] For Ludwig I developed an almost filial feeling as of a younger for an older revolutionist. [...] The kindness of all the Lores to me was personal, and in spite of politics, for all {{the other members of the}} family, except Ludwig, were outspoken in their detestation of the Communist Party. [...] Chambers also describes a defector's fear of retribution from the Soviet Underground, which Lore and he shared: [...] I did not know that at the very time I was visiting him most frequently, Lore was under surveillance. [...] He was being watched, not by the American authorities, but by the Russian secret police... I discovered that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> walk alone with me on the street at night and that he was terrified to get into an automobile alone with me. Then I knew that there was something seriously amiss. But I had been out of the Communist Party six or seven years, and Lore was dead, before I discovered that the old Bolshevik, in whom, as a younger man, I respected the older revolutionist, had denounced me (around 1941) to the F.B.I. I learned it not from the FBI, but from another security agency of the Government. [...] I respected Lore all the more for that act. My feeling for him and for all the Lores remained unchanged.|$|E
