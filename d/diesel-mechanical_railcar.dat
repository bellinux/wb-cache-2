2500|$|Driving trailers, {{also known}} as [...] "control cars" [...] and {{numbered}} in the 61xx series, retained an operative cab and were marshalled {{at the end of}} the train remote from the locomotive. The cab retained most of the original (<b>diesel-mechanical)</b> <b>railcar</b> controls, which were modified to control the (diesel-electric) locomotive; for instance, the gear selector became the eight-notch power control. The guard's compartment contained a boiler for train heating and a diesel generator set to supply lights and boiler auxiliaries; because the generator blocked one of the compartment's doors, the guard normally travelled in the corresponding compartment of the connector car.|$|E
50|$|The station {{opened in}} 1954 as Higham. The {{additional}} station, with two {{others on the}} Armadale line, marked the introduction of <b>diesel-mechanical</b> <b>railcars</b> on Perth's metropolitan passenger railways. Higham was renamed Beckenham in 1969. The platforms are staggered across William Street to minimise the time the level crossing is closed to road traffic.|$|R
5000|$|After 1945 the GNR(I) {{found itself}} in a poor {{financial}} position {{as a result of}} the deprivations of World War II and increased competition from road traffic. It looked to diesel power as a way to streamline costs and bring them back into profitability. Along with diesel locomotives, railcars offered a cheaper and more flexible means of traction than steam-hauled coaches. As a result in June 1950 the GNR(I) introduced the first of 20 <b>diesel-mechanical</b> <b>railcars</b> (numbers 600-619) ordered from AEC Ltd. of Southall.|$|R
50|$|The first {{significant}} use of DMUs in the United Kingdom {{was by the}} Great Western Railway, which introduced its small but successful series of <b>diesel-mechanical</b> GWR <b>railcars</b> in 1934. The LNER and London, Midland and Scottish Railway also experimented with DMUs in the 1930s, the LMS both on its own system, and on that of its Northern Irish subsidiary, but development was curtailed by World War II.|$|R
