40|$|Venomous {{animals are}} often {{referred}} to as poisonous. Many scientists make a distinction that venomous describes an animal that injects a harmful substance, while poisonous refers to something that is harmful if ingested. Most dictionaries indicate the words are synonymous. In this article, venomous will reflect an injectable harmful compound. In West Virginia, it seems like the most commonly discussed venomous animals are the timber rattlesnake, the northern copperhead, and the black widow spider. Only one cottonmouth, also known as a water moccasin, has been documented in the Mountain State. It was on a barge which had come up the Ohio River from the Mississippi River. We do host plenty of water snakes, and although they can be pretty defensive, none are venomous. Similarly, we have plenty of harvestmen, otherwise known as <b>daddy</b> or granddaddy <b>longlegs,</b> which are nonvenomous. The urban legend goes like this: these arachnids have venom that is extremely deadly to humans, but our skin protects us from their tiny fangs. The truth is that animals don’t waste their energy producing venom they can’t use to subdue their prey. Harvestmen do prey on tiny insects and other small animals in addition to eating some plant material. With those common misconceptions straightened out, let’s explore the real venomous West Virginians.

It was found to consist of a hard, smooth, huge object with a rounded summit surmounted by a short upright projection resembling a section of a cabbage stalk divided transversely. This projection was not solid, but was a hollow cylinder plugged with a soft woody substance unknown to our region--that is, {{it had been so}} plugged, but unfortunately this obstruction had been heedlessly removed by Norway Rat, Chief of the Sappers and Miners, before our arrival. The vast object before us, so mysteriously conveyed from the glittering domains of space, was found to be hollow and nearly filled with a pungent liquid of a brownish hue, like rainwater that has stood for some time. And such a spectacle as met our view! Norway Rat was perched upon the summit engaged in thrusting his tail into the cylindrical projection, drawing it out dripping, permitting the struggling multitude of laborers to suck the end of it, then straightway reinserting it and delivering the fluid to the mob as before. Evidently this liquor had strangely potent qualities; for all that partook of it were immediately exalted with great and pleasurable emotions, and went staggering about singing ribald songs, embracing, fighting, dancing, discharging irruptions of profanity, and defying all authority. Around us struggled a massed and uncontrolled mob--uncontrolled and likewise uncontrollable, for the whole army, down to the very sentinels, were mad like the rest, by reason of the drink. We were seized upon by these reckless creatures, and within the hour we, even we, were undistinguishable from the rest--the demoralization was complete and universal. In time the camp wore itself out with its orgies and sank into a stolid and pitiable stupor, in whose mysterious bonds rank was forgotten and strange bedfellows made, our eyes, at the resurrection, being blasted and our souls petrified with the incredible spectacle of that intolerable stinking scavenger, the Tumble-Bug, and the illustrious patrician my Lord Grand <b>Daddy,</b> Duke of <b>Longlegs,</b> lying soundly steeped in sleep, and clasped lovingly in each other's arms, the like whereof hath not been seen in all the ages that tradition compasseth, and doubtless none shall ever in this world find faith to master the belief of it save only we that have beheld the damnable and unholy vision.

2500|$|The Opiliones [...] or [...] (formerly Phalangida) are {{an order}} of arachnids colloquially known as harvestmen, {{harvesters}} or <b>daddy</b> <b>longlegs.</b> Although both harvestmen and spiders are arachnids, the two orders are not otherwise closely related. , over 6,500 species of harvestmen have been discovered worldwide, although {{the total number of}} extant species may exceed 10,000. The order Opiliones includes five suborders: Cyphophthalmi, Eupnoi, Dyspnoi, Laniatores, and the recently named Tetrophthalmi. With the exception of the Dyspnoi (which are restricted to North America and Eurasia), representatives of each can be found on every continent except Antarctica. Well-preserved fossils have been found in the 400-million-year-old Rhynie cherts of Scotland, and 305-million-year-old rocks in France, which look surprisingly modern, indicating that their basic body plan appeared very early on, and, at least in some taxa, has changed little since that time. Their phylogenetic position within the Arachnida is disputed: their closest relatives may be the mites (Acari) or the Novogenuata (the Scorpiones, Pseudoscorpiones, and Solifugae). Although superficially similar to and often misidentified as spiders (order Araneae), the Opiliones are a distinct order that is not closely related to spiders. They can be easily distinguished from long-legged spiders by their fused body regions and single pair of eyes {{in the middle of the}} cephalothorax. Spiders have a distinct abdomen that is separated from the cephalothorax by a constriction, and they have three to four pairs of eyes, usually around the margins of the cephalothorax.|$|E
