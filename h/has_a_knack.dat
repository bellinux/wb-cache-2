As of Season 3, {{they are}} aware of the clones, but think they are simply Alison's sisters. Gemma <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for showing up at awkward moments, such as when Sarah (dressed as Alison) was trying to keep Paul from killing Vic, when her parents were burying Dr. Leekie's body, and when Alison and Donnie were having some time to themselves.|$|E

500|$|Wizards & Warriors III {{received}} preview {{coverage in}} the November1991 issue of Nintendo Power. There, the magazine praised the graphics as being [...] "eye-grabbers", saying that [...] "Rare <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for bold, colorful graphics". They also lauded the game's expansiveness and challenge. However, a couple months later, they announced that the game's release was delayed. The game would eventually receive a rating in its [...] "George & Rob's Now Playing" [...] review section in its April1992 issue, {{but it did not}} receive a review.|$|E

500|$|In an August 1970 {{exhibition}} {{game against the}} New York Giants, Clancy caught four passes for 110 yards. [...] Packers coach Phil Bengtson said after the game, [...] "He <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> of knowing where the ball will be. [...] Clancy doesn't have great speed, but {{he has the ability}} to recognize defenses and take advantage of them." [...] While Clancy played in all 14 games for the Packers in 1970, he caught only 16 passes, leading one Green Bay writer to conclude that Clancy's [...] "anemic production" [...] resulted in double-teaming of flanker Carroll Dale and an unbalanced passing offense. [...] Clancy finished fifth in receptions on the 1970 Packers, behind Dale, tight end John Hilton, running back Donny Anderson, and even fullback Jim Grabowski.|$|E
500|$|Joseph {{returned}} as a featured instrumentalist during Yanni's 2003 Ethnicity world tour, and wrote his sixth album on stage after sound checks. The Journey Continues, {{a sequel to}} Solo Journey, features Joseph on solo piano. [...] Debbage writes, [...] "The magical world of movies <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for exploring sequels. There is the beauty and beast effect when taking this pathway. The creative beauty allows the viewers to see the continued growth of its characters. The beastly aspect of this exploration is the Hollywood exploitation of an almost guaranteed return on its investment with no regard for its creative progression that usually sees diminishing returns. Bradley Joseph has decided to walk this tightrope by following up with Solo Journey that was released back in 2000. I am glad to report that The Journey Continues is entrenched in beauty, holding up well to its predecessor." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2011, a Daytime Emmy Awards [...] "final push" [...] by Canyon News {{suggested}} that Case's performance needed more Emmy attention. Soap Opera Digest praised Phyllis finding {{the evidence that}} freed Sharon from prison in 2011, writing: [...] "The twist that Phyl hijacked the glory from both Adam and estranged sister Avery was downright delicious—and made Sharon beholden her worst enemy. The cherry on top? Sharon giving Adam an overdue verbal beatdown. Justice has finally been served." [...] Case's performance in 2012, described as a [...] "whirlwind year", was met with critical acclaim due to writing by Bell (which, in turn, was criticized). On-Air On-Soaps commented, [...] "Surviving {{probably one of the}} worst on-screen character assassinations in soap opera history, which virtually left viewers wondering, what the heck are the writers doing to the integrity of Sharon Newman, the once befallen heroine of Genoa City?, Case rebounded by making her performances noteworthy, no matter what the creative teams decided to do to her character." [...] This led Soap Opera Uncensored to name her Entertainer of the Year in January 2013. In December 2015, Soap Opera Digest praised her portrayal of the character's [...] "emotional roller coaster" [...] and remarked, [...] "Sharon Case <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for bringing emotional depth and reality to even the most outrageously soapy situations".|$|E

2500|$|Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Like Gaston pointed out, Belle <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> {{for finding}} monsters. Flashbacks showed how her sweet nature has been a benefit and how it's caused {{problems}} for her. The trip backwards was so-so, but Germann's performance and Hades' machinations made the episode." [...] Ratcliffe gave the episode a 7.0 rating out of 10.|$|E
2500|$|Jupiter is a {{prolific}} reader and inventor and frequently invents {{a device that}} simplifies solving a mystery. Jupiter <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for usually thinking about clues correctly to solve an otherwise unsolvable mystery. He also likes to play pranks on the other two investigators. [...] Because of his intellectual side, Jupe is adept at using big words and frequently uses them to his advantage, particularly to seem older, annoy Pete, and startle adults. [...] Jupe hates to dismiss an unsolved mystery, which frequently means that he drags Bob and Pete along for the ride.|$|E
2500|$|Cerebus is an amoral character. [...] He {{is often}} foul-mouthed and uncouth, has a vicious temper, and loves getting drunk. [...] In the Guys story arc, Cerebus is {{described}} as having [...] "a self-absorption that borders on the pathological." [...] In Church and State, Cerebus, after becoming Pope, uses brutal methods to teach morality lessons. [...] However, he is brave, crafty, and can show genuine affection to those he considers equals or those he has feelings for. [...] He is a skilled tactician and strategist, is very proficient at hand to hand combat, and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for improvisation and manipulation. [...] He received training in magic as a child, but is depicted as being able to recognize magic {{and deal with it}} rather than use it.|$|E

2500|$|GameSpy's Sterling McGarvey {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 2.5 out of 5, writing Luxoflux have [...] "turned a {{slightly}} above-par GTA clone into a sub-par franchise." [...] He {{was critical of}} the recreation of New York; [...] "textures look rather drab and plain, and the draw distance looks blurry and uninteresting [...] it really feels as though the development team failed to capture one of New York's most distinctive traits: the raw humanity of it all." [...] Of the graphics, he wrote, [...] "the frame rate <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for chugging. Considering it's a console and not a five year-old PC running this game, it's unacceptable. Out of nowhere, the frame rate will completely bottom out while Marcus patrols the streets." [...] He concluded by criticizing the game for being unfinished, arguing anyone who buys it will [...] "have dropped their hard-earned money to beta test a truly unfinished game." ...|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Chris Roper was {{impressed}} with New York City, praising [...] "how well your general duties as a cop are tied into the game, working very well alongside your own personal investigations," [...] and finding the gameplay and game mechanics superior to Streets of LA. Eurogamer's Jim Rossignol was critical of the AI; [...] "the perps you take down never suggest that they are anything other than mindless automata ready to be slain, and exhibit an artificiality that could never be described as 'intelligence'." [...] GameSpy's Sterling McGarvey wrote [...] "Luxoflux have turned a slightly above-par GTA clone into a sub-par franchise." [...] Of the graphics, he wrote, [...] "the frame rate <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for chugging. Considering it's a console and not a five year-old PC running this game, it's unacceptable. Out of nowhere, the frame rate will completely bottom out while Marcus patrols the streets." [...] He called the game [...] "unfinished." [...] GameSpot's Greg Mueller accused the game of being [...] "so riddled with problems that {{it feels like it}} was rushed to make it to store shelves in time for the holidays. He cited [...] "collision detection issues and edge detection problems that cause you to get stuck {{on the edge of a}} platform. [...] the game will actually freeze up entirely from time to time [...] There are also some pretty ugly clipping issues here too." [...] He concluded [...] "the technical problems far outweigh any faint hope this game ever had of being enjoyable. If you're curious about what a video game looks like before it goes through adequate testing and quality assurance, then by all means give this one a try." ...|$|E
