5|$|In Judaism, the Western Wall is venerated as {{the sole}} remnant of the Holy Temple. It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, {{as it is the}} closest {{permitted}} accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the Even ha-shetiya or Foundation Stone, which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sin</b> punishable by Kareth. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the Dome of the Rock is the Foundation Stone, some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain. This spot was the site of the Holy of Holies when the Temple stood.|$|E

25|$|Clemens, your lecture was {{magnificent}}. It was eloquent, moving, sincere. Never in {{my entire}} life have I listened to such a magnificent piece of descriptive narration. But you committed one unpardonable sin– the unpardonable sin. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sin</b> you must never commit again. You closed a most eloquent description, by which you had keyed your audience up to a pitch of the intensest interest, with a piece of atrocious anti-climax which nullified all the really fine effect you had produced.|$|E
25|$|Avoidance of {{the church}} tax (between 1 and 2 percent {{depending}} on location) has been a popular reason cited for defections from the Church. In 2010, the number of defections hit a record of 83,097, caused {{in part by the}} church's position that homosexuality <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sin.</b> That position was made clear on a Finnish television discussion program concerning gay rights that was broadcast on 12 October 2010, in which church clergy and laymen were divided both for and against proposed legal amendments to increase LGBT rights.|$|E

25|$|Leaving Islam <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sin</b> and a {{religious}} crime.

Before executing the death penalty, sharia demands that the individual be offered one chance to return to Islam.|$|E
25|$|According to Shia theologians, infallibility is {{considered}} a rational necessary precondition for spiritual and religious guidance. They argue that since God has commanded absolute obedience from these figures they must only order that which is right. The state of infallibility {{is based on the}} Shia interpretation of the verse of purification. Thus, they are the most pure ones, the only immaculate ones preserved from, and immune to, all uncleanness. It does not mean that supernatural powers prevent them from committing a sin, but {{due to the fact that}} they have absolute belief in God, they refrain from doing anything that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sharia rulings {{fall into}} one of five {{categories}} known as “the five decisions” (al-aḥkām al-khamsa): mandatory (farḍ or wājib), recommended (mandūb or mustaḥabb), neutral (mubāḥ), reprehensible (makrūh), and forbidden (ḥarām). It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sin</b> or a crime to perform a forbidden action or not to perform a mandatory action. Reprehensible acts should be avoided, but they are not considered to be sinful or punishable in court. Avoiding reprehensible acts and performing recommended acts is held to be subject of reward in the afterlife, while allowed actions entail no judgement from God. Jurists disagree on whether the term ḥalāl covers the first three or the first four categories. The legal and moral verdict depends on whether the action is committed out of necessity (ḍarūra).|$|E

25|$|Though the {{relationship}} between homosexuality and religion can vary greatly across time and place, within and between different religions and sects, and regarding different forms of homosexuality and bisexuality, current authoritative bodies and doctrines of the world's largest religions generally view homosexuality negatively. This can range from quietly discouraging homosexual activity, to explicitly forbidding same-sex sexual practices among adherents and actively opposing social acceptance of homosexuality. Some teach that homosexual orientation itself is sinful, others state that only the sexual act <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sin,</b> others are completely accepting of gays and lesbians, while some encourage homosexuality. Some claim that homosexuality can be overcome through religious faith and practice. On the other hand, voices exist within many of these religions that view homosexuality more positively, and liberal religious denominations may bless same-sex marriages. Some view same-sex love and sexuality as sacred, and a mythology of same-sex love can be found around the world.|$|E
25|$|Osteen has {{generally}} avoided discussing controversial {{issues such as}} gay marriage, abortion, and politics. However, when asked, Osteen {{said that he is}} opposed to same-sex marriage. Osteen refuses to preach about homosexuality due to his belief that God likes, accepts, and approves of all people. When asked if he thought God approves of homosexuality, Osteen said homosexuality <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sin</b> according to the Scripture, but gay people are welcome in his church. He has said sin is human nature, nobody's perfect, and he is not judging but, God is the judge. Osteen has also stated he believes a person can be freed from a lifestyle of homosexuality; it is a process and God can free anyone of any sin or addiction. Osteen has also stressed he does not approve of homophobia, but his faith is based on his reading of the Scriptures. He has said the church has a tendency to become overly focused on single issues (such as homosexuality) to the point of neglecting others.|$|E

500|$|Squab pie {{has been}} the subject of poetry. In [...] "The Squab-Pie.

A boy on the ship goes into town to claim a large squab pie from the bakery for a penny, though it was not meant to be his. Set on a Sunday, the family who had commissioned the pie from the baker, in order to avoid cooking, try to find it, but to no avail. Taylor explains the moral is that if you believe it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sin</b> to cook on a Sunday, you should not be still having a big meal by getting a baker to cook for you.|$|E

500|$|The Rights of Woman is an {{extension}} of Wollstonecraft's arguments in the Rights of Men. In the Rights of Men, as the title suggests, she is concerned with the rights of particular men (18th-century British men) while in the Rights of Woman, she is concerned with the rights afforded to [...] "woman", an abstract category. She does not isolate her argument to 18th-century women or British women. The first chapter of the Rights of Woman addresses the issue of natural rights and asks who has those inalienable rights and on what grounds. She answers that since natural rights are given by God, for one segment of society to deny them to another segment <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sin.</b> The Rights of Woman thus engages not only specific events in France and in Britain but also larger questions being raised by political philosophers such as John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|E
