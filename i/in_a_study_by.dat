5|$|A refined {{estimate}} of $1.1billion ($2.74 billion in 2007 dollars) was determined <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>by</b> the International Trade Commission {{at the request}} of the United States Congress. A supplemental appropriation of $951million for disaster relief was voted by Congress, of which the largest share went to the Small Business Administration, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.|$|E
5|$|After 55 to 65 days, juveniles reach full adult {{measurements}} and battle among themselves until a dominant juvenile forces its siblings {{to leave the}} natal area. The dominant bird remains with its parents until the following season, while its siblings leave the natal territory to join an unrelated pair who failed to breed. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>by</b> Dan Strickland, two-thirds of dominant juveniles were male.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{fipronil}} {{was blamed}} for the spread of CCD among bees, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>by</b> the Minutes-Association for Technical Coordination Fund in France, which found that even at very low nonlethal doses, this pesticide still impairs the ability to locate the hive, resulting in large numbers of foragers lost with every pollen-finding expedition, though no mention was made regarding {{any of the other}} symptoms of CCD; other studies, however, have shown no acute effect of fipronil on honey bees. Fipronil is designed to eliminate insects similar to bees, such as yellowjackets (Vespula germanica) and many other colonial pests by a process of 'toxic baiting', whereby one insect returning to the hive spreads the pesticide among the brood.|$|E
30|$|It is {{also not}} easy to operationalize {{complexity}} of the regional economic development and wellbeing (for a discussion see e. g. Russ and Jones 2008). The previously reported studies (e. g. Audretsch and Keilbach 2004) often work with the Gros Domestic Product (GDP) only. To increase robustness of our findings, we work with the three outcome variables representing the regional economic development and country’s wealth: Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP) that {{was used as a}} representation of economic growth for example <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studies</b> <b>by</b> Dvouletý (2017 a); Armeanu et al. (2015) or Valliere and Peterson (2009), Gross National Income (GNI) that was used for example <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studies</b> <b>by</b> Smith (2010) or Ahmad et al. (2011), and the Human Development Index (HDI) that was used for example <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studies</b> <b>by</b> Dhahri and Omri (2018) or Gries and Naudé (2011).|$|R

5|$|Many CAS family {{proteins}} {{have altered}} activity and functional roles in cancer progression and metastasis, with functional roles in influencing cellular adhesion, migration and drug resistance. Changes in CASS4 {{may also be}} associated with human malignancies. CASS4 function was linked to {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>by</b> Miao et al. that correlated elevated CASS4 expression with lymph node metastasis and high TNM stage. In addition, this study detected a significant difference in cytoplasmic accumulation of CASS4 protein between high (H1299 and BE1) and low (LTE and A549) metastatic potential lung cancer cell lines. These may suggest CASS4 as a possible prognostic marker in clinical management of NSCLC.|$|E
5|$|Spring Brook {{experiences}} noticeable flow loss. As of 2009, it {{has high}} levels of sodium and alkalinity. Pittson Township and the borough of Moosic have permits to discharge stormwater into it. However, the water quality and habitat quality of the stream are relatively unimpacted. The stream has relatively high water quality even where it flows through a concrete channel. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>by</b> the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, it was found not to fail any water quality standards either during base flow or storm flow conditions. However, a study {{from the previous year}} found concentrations of sodium and alkalinity exceeding the threshold for concern. In the early 1900s, Spring Brook was a clear stream in its upper reaches. However, by the time it reached the property of the Du Pont Powder Company, it was affected by slush pumped into it by the Pennsylvania Coal Company.|$|E
