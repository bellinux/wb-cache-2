Recent research on an industrial case study by Anand et. al. reveals that AFDX <b>frame</b> <b>management</b> design is vulnerable to faults such as network errors, network babbling etc. Their proposed modifications, though are able to solve these problems, degrades the performance of network in terms of delay at receiving end and delay before the receiving end-system gets reset.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the past}} few years the Wireless local area Network (WLAN) has been the most popular {{selection}} of communication among users. WLAN that is based on the IEEE 802. 11 standard additionally referred to as wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), offers quality and flexibility with a comparatively low value tousers. Additionally, wireless technology is providing easier web access that is too tough and expensive to reach with ancient wired infrastructure. IEEE 802. 16, additionally referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), is another standard with similar general principles as WIFI with the most blessings being it covers bigger area and contains a higher rate. WLAN and WiMax beneath optimum conditions when compared, the quickest WLAN association is 54 megabits/sec whereas WiMAX is regarding 75 Mbit/s. WLAN contains vary of regarding 30 meters and WiMAX will cover up to 50 kilometers. Although WiMAX greatly outperforms Wi-Fi, user devices like desktops, laptops and cell phones got to have WiMAX capability to be able to hook up with WiMAX sources. Currently, not several user devices have WiMAX capability; the majority has Wi-Fi capability. This paper describes the approaches for enabling the coexistence of WiFi and wimax in unlicensed ISM spectrum. We will begin with learning HMM (hidden markov model) supported traces of the network. Then comes the estimation of performance of Wi-Fi in presence of interference from WIMAX. In conclusion we are going to develop unique <b>frame</b> <b>management</b> protocol Known as HMM driven white space aware <b>frame</b> <b>management</b> protocol for coexistence of Wi-Fi and wimax...|$|E

The approach supports unconstrained camera motion with in-sequence loop closing, variation in camera focal distance (zoom) and recovery from video sequence breaks. Real-time performance, over extended duration sequences, is realised via novel aspects of <b>frame</b> <b>management</b> within the mosaic representation and thus avoiding the high data redundancy associated with temporally dense, spatially overlapping video frame inputs. This managed set of image frames is visualised in real time using a dynamic mosaic representation of overlapping textured graphics primitives in place of the traditional globally constructed, and hence frequently reconstructed, mosaic image. Within this formulation, subsequent optimisation occurring during online construction can thus efficiency adjust relative frame positions via simple primitive position transforms. Effective visualisation is similarly facilitated by online inter-frame blending to overcome the illumination and colour variance associated with modern camera hardware. The evaluation illustrates overall robustness in video mosaic construction under a diverse range of conditions including indoor and outdoor environments, varying illumination and presence of in-scene motion on varying computational platforms...|$|E

In experimental cabbage fields we studied ground beetle abundance and diversity in three different organic farming systems (O 1, O 2, and O 3).

The systems O 2 and O 3 also included green manures, and in O 3 strips of green manure were left between crop rows. A conventional system was included as control. Only organic systems O 2 and O 3 showed benefits for ground beetles, but in different ways. Abundance of all ground beetle species was highest in May in O 2, while O 3 supported the highest abundance of habitat specialists with preferences for field margins reflecting the conservation of green manure strips. The ground beetle community of O 3 was most diverse characterized by highest number of species and evenness (equitability among species).

40|$|Problem framing is an {{analysis}} {{that has been}} widely applied {{in the field of}} environmental management. It is a way of investigating the diverse ways in which different stakeholders view, or frame, a problem or issue. Moreover, a framing analysis conceptualises problems as socially constructed as well as objective realities and therefore analyses how stakeholders communicate discursively about the same issue. There are many similarities between environmental management and development management, in particular, the diverse range of involved parties, each of whom have different levels of power and different interests. For this reason, this research applies a problem framing analysis to a community development project. The project focussed on the Little River Rail Trail, which is currently being developed on Banks Peninsula. The research looked in particular at how participants talked about the Rail Trail and how this related to their particular frames of reference. Moreover, the research investigated which ‘frames’ were privileged, and which excluded, and how frames were managed by the participants. The results showed that the different participants framed the Rail Trail in very different ways. Moreover, whilst there were dominant frames that occurred across a range of participants, there were other frames that were marginalised. It was also found that participants used a range of <b>frame</b> <b>management</b> strategies in order to manage competing or oppositional frames. The framing analysis provided a useful and holistic investigation of the LRRT that was contextual and flexible enough to tolerate a high level of diversity. Thus, it indicates that the framing analysis may help development professionals to better appreciate the diversity of frames present in particular projects, issues and problems and, in particular, be more aware of the discursive power functioning within these contexts...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of wildlife tourism {{has been dominated}} by ideologies informed by western colonialism and its values of nature. These ideologies, made transparent through communicative and interpretative discourses, influence the way management policies and practices are devised and enacted. The inherent scientific and utilitarian views are supported by a doctrine of separation. This is apparent in the dualism posed, and enacted, between nature and culture that sees humans as being the sole carriers of culture that separates them from the uncultured and uncivilised world of nature into which all other animals, and certainly untamed wildlife, belong. It justifies the use of non-humans for human purposes and continues to allow us to treat non-human animals and other forms of nature in often abominable ways. This thesis investigates two situations in which wildlife tourism occurs in Australia. Fraser Island and Penguin Island are two wildlife tourism destinations {{on opposite sides of the}} continent with very different wildlife but some very similar issues. From these two contexts data was collected through interviews, focus groups, participant observation, and from literary and documentary sources. Understanding the empirical data collected from these case studies is facilitated through a social constructionist view of discourse analysis that allows an unpacking of the messages and a stance from which to challenge the dominant ideologies that <b>frame</b> <b>management</b> and interaction. In the thesis I demonstrate that anthropology, in its incarnation as environmental anthropology and as a team player in a necessarily interdisciplinary approach to understanding and resolving environmental issues, has much to offer. This engagement has the potential to enhance not only the sustainable future of naturebased activities like wildlife tourism but also the relevance of anthropology in the postcolonial contemporary world. The need for a holistic framework encompassing all the stakeholders in any wildlife tourism venture is proposed. This approach to wildlife tourism is best serviced by examining perspectives, values and concerns of all members of the wildlife tourism community at any given destination. It is only through this type of holistic and situated focus that we can hope to effectively understand, and then manage, in the best interests of all parties. More specifically, and finally, I argue for a rethinking of the way wildlife tourism interactions are managed in some settings. The ideology of separation, enacted both conceptually and physically to create maintain boundaries, is demonstrated through the two case studies and the ways in which interactions between humans and wildlife are currently managed. An alternative is posed, that by reconstructing management in settings where wildlife tourists may be more accepting of their own responsibility towards nature, a model can be developed that allows people and wildlife to co-exist without ‘killing’ the natural instincts of either...|$|E
