5|$|Hinkley Point A {{nuclear power}} station was a Magnox power station {{constructed}} between 1957 and 1962 and operating until ceasing generation in 2000. Hinkley Point B is an Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) {{which was designed to}} generate 1250MW of electricity (MWe). Construction of Hinkley Point B started in 1967. In September 2008 it was announced, by Electricité de France (EDF), that a third, twin-unit European Pressurized Reactor (<b>EPR)</b> <b>reactor</b> known as Hinkley Point C is planned, to replace Hinkley Point B which is due for closure in 2016.|$|E
25|$|The court expects EDF's {{projected}} {{investment programme}} in existing plant, including post Fukushima safety improvements, will add between 9.5% and 14.5% to generation costs, taking costs to between 37.9 and 54.2 EUR/MWh.

25|$|The next {{generation}} design for French reactors is the EPR, {{which will have}} a broader scope than France alone, with a plant in Finland and two in China undergoing construction, and two more proposed for the United Kingdom. The first French EPR is under construction at the Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant. As a result of delays and cost overruns, completion is now scheduled for 2017. An additional <b>EPR</b> <b>reactor</b> was planned for the Penly Nuclear Power Plant, but this project has now been abandoned.|$|E

As the Severn estuary water supply would be inadequate to cool these larger reactors, cooling towers would be built.|$|R
50|$|In {{the year}} 2015 ten new {{reactors}} came online and 67 more were under construction {{including the first}} eight new Generation III+ AP1000 reactors in the US and China and the first four new Generation III <b>EPR</b> <b>reactors</b> in Finland, France and China.

However learning from experience, two further <b>EPR</b> <b>reactors</b> {{under construction in}} China are on, and ahead, of schedule respectively. As of 2013, according to the IAEA and the European Nuclear Society, worldwide there were 68 civil nuclear power reactors under construction in 15 countries. China has 29 of these nuclear power reactors under construction, as of 2013, with plans to build many more, while in the US the licenses of almost half its reactors have been extended to 60years, and plans to build another dozen are under serious consideration. [...] There are also {{a considerable number of}} new reactors being built in South Korea, India, and Russia. At least 100 older and smaller reactors will [...] "most probably be closed over the next 10–15 years". This is probable only if one does not factor in the ongoing Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program, created to permit the extension of the life span of the USA's 104 nuclear reactors to 60 years. The licenses of almost half of the USA's reactors have been extended to 60years as of 2008.

50|$|After the Nuclear Suppliers Group {{agreed to}} allow nuclear exports to India, France was the first country to sign a {{civilian}} nuclear agreement with India, on 30 September 2008. During the December 2010 visit of the French President Nicolas Sarkozy to India, framework agreements were signed for the setting up two third-generation <b>EPR</b> <b>reactors</b> of 1650 MW each at Jaitapur, Maharashtra by the French company Areva. The deal caters for {{the first set of}} two of six planned reactors and the supply of nuclear fuel for 25 years. The contract and pricing is yet to be finalised. Construction is unlikely to start before 2014 because of regulatory issues and difficulty in sourcing major components from Japan due to India not being a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.|$|R

40|$|Evaluation of plasma {{parameters}} of driven and ignited Tokamaks {{for use in}} experimental power <b>reactor</b> (<b>EPR)</b> and commercial <b>reactor</b> applications has been performed. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the most pessimistic conditions under which a power producing reactor could be operated assuming the use of a high efficiency power (HEP) cycle. The adoption of the HEP cycle will enable a power producing reactor to operate with a plasma Q of 1. 5 or less as opposed to a required Q of approximately 8. 0 utilizing a conventional conversion cycle. Q is defined as the ratio of thermal fusion power produced to beam input power required. Pessimistic assumptions of large impurity concentrations and short confinement times are made in order to determine the regimes of operation the HEP cycle would render accessible. Characteristic values of plasma and reactor parameters are listed for each of three reactor models for both <b>EPR's</b> and commercial <b>reactors</b> and the favorable implications of the HEP cycle are delineated.
