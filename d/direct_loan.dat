2500|$|The {{most common}} New Testament term {{translated}} as [...] "hell" [...] is [...] (gehenna), a <b>direct</b> <b>loan</b> of Hebrew גהנום/גהנם (ge-hinnom). Apart from one use in , this term is found {{exclusively in the}} synoptic gospels.

2500|$|German {{also often}} {{serves as a}} model for the {{creation}} of new words. An example is Surs. tschetapuorla 'vacuum cleaner', a compound of tschitschar 'to suck' and puorla 'dust', following the model of German Staubsauger – the Italian word, aspirapolvere possibly being itself a calque on the German word. The Engadinese dialects on the other hand have adopted aspiradur from Italian aspiratore, which, however, does not mean [...] "vacuum cleaner". The Engadinese dialects on the other hand have adopted aspiradur from Italian aspiratore. A skyscraper, which is a <b>direct</b> <b>loan</b> translation from English in many Romance languages (as in French gratte-en-ciel, Italian grattacielo), is a loan translation of German Wolkenkratzer (literally 'cloud-scraper') in Sursilvan: il sgrattaneblas (from sgrattar 'to scratch' and neblas 'clouds'). The Engadinese varieties again follow the Italian pattern of sgrattatschêl (from tschêl 'sky'). A more recent word is la natelnumra 'the cell phone number', which follows the word order of Swiss German Natelnummer, and is found alongside la numra da natel.|$|E

2500|$|The Urban Flood Prevention and Drainage Program (APL) is {{the result}} of a {{government}} commitment to flood prevention and risk management. The program places emphasis on risk prevention, and developing a strategy that guides targeted Provinces from protection to a full risk management scheme.

Planned investments will benefit about 500,000 people over an area that suffers losses estimated at US$50 million annually.|$|E
