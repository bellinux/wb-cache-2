25|$|After {{the success}} of Chocolat, Binoche was internationally {{recognized}} as an A-list movie star in the early 2000s, but as an actor her persona became somewhat fixed following a series of period roles portraying a stoic heroine facing tragedy and desolation. Keen to try something new, Binoche returned to French cinema in 2002 in an unlikely role: she played a ditsy beautician in <b>Jet</b> <b>Lag</b> opposite Jean Reno. The film, directed by Daniele Thompson, was a box-office hit in France and Binoche was once again nominated for a César for Best Actress. The film {{tells the story of}} a couple who meet at an airport during a strike. Initially the pair despises each other, but, over the course of one night, they find common ground and maybe even love. This playful spirit continued when Binoche featured in a 2003 Italian television commercial for the chocolates Ferrero Rocher. The advertisement played upon her Chocolat persona featuring Binoche handing out the chocolates to people on the streets of Paris.|$|E

25|$|The MCC touring team left Tilbury Docks on the S.S. Stratheden amidst {{calls to}} cancel the Ashes tour because of the {{weakness}} of the team led by Freddie Brown. Such critics were, of course, ignored and the team traveled in first-class luxury on the P liner. Though it took several weeks for them to reach Fremantle in Western Australia this method avoided <b>jet</b> <b>lag</b> and allowed the team to relax and get to know each other. The teenager Brian Close had been excused from National Service in the British Army and was particularly active in exploring the whole ship from top to bottom. Apart from the normal deck exercises some of the MCC players formed a short lived band and Godfrey Evans gave his well-known impression of Carmen Miranda in the fancy dress party. They stopped in Ceylon for a one-day game which was drawn, but saw Arthur Macintyre make 104 and Len Hutton damage one of his fingers. They otherwise arrived safely and found that steak and fried eggs were regularly served in Australian hotels (virtually unobtainable in ration-bound Britain) and soon put on weight.|$|E

500|$|The Maharishi had {{arranged}} a simple lifestyle for his guests, which included stone cottages and vegetarian meals taken outdoors in a communal setting. The days {{were devoted to}} meditating and attending lectures by the Maharishi, who spoke from a flower-bedecked platform in an auditorium. The Maharishi also gave private lessons to the individual Beatles, nominally due to their late arrival. The tranquil environment provided by the Maharishi – complete with meditation, relaxation, {{and away from the}} media throng – helped the band to relax. Harrison told Saltzman, [...] "Like, we're The Beatles after all, aren't we? We have all the money you could ever dream of. We have all the fame you could ever wish for. But, it isn't love. It isn't health. It isn't peace inside, is it?" [...] Lennon was respectful of the Maharishi but not in awe of him. At their first meeting Donovan remembers that the Maharishi was [...] "amiable but non-talkative", and during an awkward silence Lennon walked across the room and patted the Maharishi on the head, saying, [...] "There's a good little guru" [...] while the room erupted in laughter. Maharishi cancelled the formal lectures for a time and told students to meditate for as long as possible. One student meditated for 42 straight hours, and Pattie Boyd once meditated for seven hours. Boyd's sister Jenny meditated for long periods as well, but also suffered from dysentery (misdiagnosed as tonsilitis); she said Lennon also felt unwell, suffering from <b>jet</b> <b>lag</b> and insomnia. The lengthy meditation sessions left many students moody and oversensitive. Like the 60 other students at the ashram, the Beatles adopted native dress and the ashram had a tailor on the premises to make clothes for the students. The Beatles shopped in Rishikesh and the women bought saris for themselves and to be made into shirts and jackets for the men, which affected Western fashion when the Beatles wore them after going home.|$|E

40|$|Emma Donoghue {{has been}} on the {{literary}} scene since 1993 when she published her first novel Stir – Fry, a coming of age novel and, at the same time, a crude and unwelcome quest towards discovering one’s identity. An author of five more novels, other pieces of fiction, as well as a PhD in English from Cambridge University, comes back with her much biographical novel Landing published in 2007. Landing is one in a line of Emma Donoghue’s novels that renders the reader every possible cliché about strangeness and otherness ferociously authentic. In her Landing Emma Donoghue captures what can be called a clash of identities in the un-reality of timelessness — here erratic travel in the <b>jet</b> <b>lagged</b> era — where an apparent homelessness and strangeness are irrevocably written into both national and personal histories. Since the stories of attracting opposites have been exhausted in literature, Donoghue manages to make her story absorbing by taking the ambiguous nature of selfhood into the stereotyped context of Canadian and Irish histories and well beyond into the pots of personal narrative of youth, adulthood, ethnicity and gender. In the paper, we will have an opportunity to look at the (de) construction of personal and foreign narratives, histories of selfhood and otherness within hostile environments of public and private Canada and Ireland.

40|$|This study {{examines}} interannual to decadal variability of the Kuroshio Extension (KE) jet using satellite altimeter observations from 1993 to 2010. The leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) mode of sea level {{variability in the}} KE region represents the meridional shift of the KE jet, followed by its strength changes with a few month lag. This shift of the KE <b>jet</b> <b>lags</b> atmospheric fluctuations over the eastern North Pacific by about three years. Broad sea level anomalies (SLAs) emerge in the eastern North Pacific 3 - 4 years before the upstream KB jet shift, and propagate westward along the KE jet axis. In {{the course of the}} propagation, the meridional scale of the SLAs gradually narrows, and their amplitude increases. This westward propagation of SLAs with a speed of about 5 cm s(- 1) is attributed to the westward propagation of the meridional shift of the jet, consistent with the thin-jet theory, whose importance has been suggested by previous numerical studies. In addition, the westward-propagating signals tend to conserve their quasigeostrophic potential vorticity anomaly, which may explain the characteristic changes of SLAs during the propagation. After the westward-propagating signals of positive (negative) SLAs reach at the east coast of Japan, the upstream KB jet strengthens (weakens) associated with the strength changes of the northern and southern recirculation gyres. Interestingly, this strength change of the KE jet propagates eastward with a speed of about 6 cm s(- 1), suggesting an importance of advection by the current...|$|R
40|$|We study a {{stochastic}} {{variability of}} SS 433 in the 10 ^- 4 - 5 × 10 ^- 2 Hz frequency range based on RXTE data, and on simultaneous observations with RXTE and optical telescopes. We {{find that the}} cross-correlation functions and power spectra depend drastically on the precession phase of the supercritical accretion disc. When the wind funnel of the disc is maximally open to the observer, a flat part emerges in the power spectrum; a break is observed at the frequency 1. 7 × 10 ^- 3 Hz, with a power-law index β≈ 1. 67 at higher frequencies. The soft emission forming mostly in the <b>jets,</b> <b>lags</b> behind the hard and optical emission. When the observer does not see the funnel and jets (the `edge-on' disc), the power spectrum is described by a single power-law with β≈ 1. 34 and no correlations between X-ray ranges are detected. We investigated two mechanisms to explain the observed variability at the open disc phase, 1) reflection of radiation at the funnel wall (X-rays and optical) and 2) the gas cooling in the jets (X-rays only). The X-ray variability {{is determined by the}} contribution of both mechanisms, however the contribution of the jets is much higher. We found that the funnel size is (2 - 2. 5) × 10 ^ 12 cm, and the opening angle is ϑ_f∼ 50 ^∘. X-ray jets may consist of three fractions with different densities: 8 × 10 ^ 13, 3 × 10 ^ 13 and 5 × 10 ^ 11 cm^- 3, with most of the jet's mass falling within the latter fraction. We suppose that revealed flat part in the power spectrum may be related to an abrupt change in the disc structure and viscous time-scale at the spherization radius, because the accretion disc becomes thick at this radius, h/r ∼ 1. The extent of the flat spectrum depends on the variation of viscosity at the spherization radius. Comment: 20 pages, 15 figures, to appear in MNRA...|$|R
