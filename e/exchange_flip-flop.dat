40|$|Lipid {{membrane}} asymmetry is {{of fundamental}} importance for biological systems and also provides an attractive means for molecular control over biomaterial surface properties (including drug carriers). In particular, temperature-dependent changes of surface properties {{can be achieved}} by taking advantage of distinct phase transitions in lipid membrane coatings where lipids <b>exchange</b> (<b>flip-flop)</b> between leaflets. In this study, temperature is used to control flip-flop of lipids in asymmetric lipid membranes on planar solid supports, where the two leaflets of the lipid membrane are in different phase states. More specifically, the lower leaflet is prepared from a supported lipid membrane composed of a high T-m lipid mixture of phosphocholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS), and a bioactive lipid on TiO 2, followed by selective removal of the top leaflet by detergent. Next, at a lower temperature, where the remaining leaflet is in the gel state, a top leaflet of a different lipid composition and in the fluid phase is formed. Phase transition-induced changes in membrane surface properties following upon temperature-activation of the prepared asymmetric membrane are demonstrated by the detection of biotinylated lipids, which were initially located (thus "hidden") in the lower-gel phase leaflet, at the surface of the top leaflet. These processes were monitored in real-time by the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) and the dual polarization interferometry (DPI) techniques, allowing modeling of the mass and the anisotropic property of the lipid structures in different phase states...|$|E
40|$|A {{model for}} the {{fundamental}} structure of nature is presented. It is based on two fundamental fermions moving with the velocity of light and differing from each other by the projection of the spin on the momentum vector. The energy of both fermions {{is proportional to the}} momentum, which is scaled inversely with the size of a length quantum. All the known forces are a manifestation of one elementary interaction, the spin <b>exchange</b> or spin <b>flip-flop</b> which takes place when two different elementary fermions come together in the same space cell. At this stage the model can explain the properties of the photon as a two-fermion particle and it can be shown that the Dirac theory for relativistic fermions could be deduced from this model. The model predicts that particles like the electron or the quark are stable combinations {{of a large number of}} the fundamental fermions, but proof of that prediction has not been given.
