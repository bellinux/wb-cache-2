5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that for an icy satellite the size of Mimas or Enceladus to <b>enter</b> <b>an</b> 'excited state' of tidal heating and convection, it would need to <b>enter</b> <b>an</b> orbital resonance before it lost too much of its primordial internal heat. Because Mimas, being smaller, would cool more rapidly than Enceladus, its window of opportunity for initiating orbital resonance-driven convection would have been considerably shorter.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, Argentine airstrikes will {{frequently}} sink Royal Navy ships, depending on how many of them were initially allocated to defensive positions. In addition, Argentine air forces will occasionally bomb and destroy British forces on the ground, which are represented as animated sprites on the map. The map also displays terrain details, including rivers and mountains. If troops are situated on top of a mountain, they will receive a defensive bonus once attacked; however, due to the steep terrain, they will move more slowly. If the player chooses to <b>enter</b> <b>an</b> enemy-controlled zone, the move will instantly end, leaving the unit vulnerable to an Argentine attack.|$|E

5|$|Gestation lasts {{approximately}} 340days, with {{an average}} range 320–370 days, and usually results in one foal; twins are rare. Horses are a precocial species, and foals are capable of standing and running {{within a short time}} following birth. Foals are usually born in the spring. The estrous cycle of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. Most mares <b>enter</b> <b>an</b> anestrus period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period. Foals are generally weaned from their mothers between four and six months of age.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} (Anthus petrosus), or just rock pipit, is {{a species of}} small {{passerine}} bird that breeds in western Europe on rocky coasts. It has streaked greyish-brown upperparts and buff underparts, and is similar in appearance to other European pipits. There are three subspecies, of which only the Fennoscandian form is migratory, wintering in shoreline habitats further south in Europe. The Eurasian rock pipit is territorial {{at least in the}} breeding season, and year-round where it is resident. Males will sometimes <b>enter</b> <b>an</b> adjacent territory to assist the resident in repelling an intruder, behaviour only otherwise known from the African fiddler crab.|$|E

5|$|What Hasekura said or did {{to bring}} about such a result is unknown. As later events tend to {{indicate}} {{that he and his}} descendants remained faithful Christians, Hasekura may have made an enthusiastic – and to a certain extent, disturbing – account of the greatness and might of Western countries and the Christian religion. He may also have encouraged an alliance between the Church and Date Masamune to take over the country (an idea advertised by the Franciscans while in Rome), which, in 1620 Japan, would have been a totally unrealistic proposition. Lastly, hopes of trade with Spain evaporated when Hasekura communicated that the Spanish King would not <b>enter</b> <b>an</b> agreement as long as persecutions were occurring {{in the rest of the}} country.|$|E
5|$|A {{visit by}} Dahlia Brinkley, the only Springfield Elementary {{graduate}} ever to <b>enter</b> <b>an</b> Ivy League college, gives Lisa a severe inferiority complex {{because she is}} involved in very few extracurricular activities. When Ned Flanders resigns as coach of Bart's Little League team, the Springfield Isotots, Lisa seizes the chance to extend her résumé and takes the position. Since she knows nothing about baseball, she seeks advice from the patrons of Moe's Tavern, who direct her to Professor Frink and his scientific colleagues. She learns about sabermetrics from them and uses this science to organize the Isotots' strategy; as a result, their record quickly improves and they rise in the league standings. However, Bart eventually rebels against her management, saying that she has taken all {{the fun out of}} the game, and hits a home run despite her orders to let the pitcher walk him. The Isotots win the game, but Lisa throws Bart off the team for his insubordination.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Igor was {{the most}} {{destructive}} tropical cyclone on record to strike the Canadian island of Newfoundland, and the strongest hurricane of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. Igor originated from a broad {{area of low pressure}} that moved off the Cape Verde islands on the west coast of Africa on September6, 2010. Tracking slowly westward, it developed into a tropical depression on September8 and strengthened into a tropical storm shortly thereafter. Higher wind shear temporarily halted intensification over the following days. On September12, explosive intensification took place, and Igor reached Category4 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. By this time, Igor had already begun a prolonged turn around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge. Peaking with winds of 155mph (250km/h), the cyclone began to <b>enter</b> <b>an</b> area unfavorable for continued strengthening, and Igor gradually weakened before brushing Bermuda as a minimal hurricane on September20. After turning northeastward, the system began an extratropical transition, which it completed shortly after striking southern Newfoundland. The remnants of Igor were later absorbed by another extratropical cyclone over the Labrador Sea on September23.|$|E

5|$|In May 1950, Bolt was {{reassigned to}} VMF-224 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, and he {{remained}} there until May 1951. The squadron flew the F2H Banshee and {{within three months}} of joining the unit he had flown more hours on the aircraft than any other pilot in the squadron. This {{was followed by a}} quick four-month tour on the staff at the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing. During this time, the US Air Force was operating its first squadron of F-86 Sabre aircraft. The Sabres were the only U.S. aircraft which performed well against the MiG-15s operated by China and North Korea in the Korean War. Bolt used his connections to <b>enter</b> <b>an</b> exchange program with the USAF in September 1951, becoming an exchange officer with the 318th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at McChord Air Force Base in Washington flying the F-94 Starfire. Soon after, he began piloting the F-86F Sabre which had been transferred to the squadron. He continued training with the squadron and was promoted to major in December 1951.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, Layla {{was moved}} to the ECW brand, debuting on 23 January 2007. She joined Brooke and Kelly Kelly to form Extreme Exposé. The trio performed a weekly dance segment on ECW, choreographed by Layla, for the next several months. In June 2007, The Miz {{was moved to}} the brand, prompting a storyline in which all three members of Extreme Exposé were attracted to him. When Kelly shifted her attentions towards Balls Mahoney, Layla, Brooke, and Miz openly mocked her, turning Layla and Brooke into villainous characters in the process. On 1 November, Brooke was released from her WWE contract, and Extreme Exposé dissolved as a group, leaving Kelly and Layla to <b>enter</b> <b>an</b> ongoing rivalry with more active in-ring roles. They were on opposite sides of a 10-Diva tag team match at Survivor Series, which Layla's team lost. In December, Layla formed an alliance with Victoria, which expanded to include Lena Yada in January 2008, and the trio continued to feud with Kelly. At WrestleMania XXIV, Layla was a lumberjill for the Divas' tag team lumberjill match. The following month, Layla was part of the winning team in a six-on-six Divas match at the Backlash pay-per-view.|$|E
5|$|The saga {{states that}} some time later, Sveinn {{approached}} Earl Rögnvaldr, {{and asked the}} earl for men and ships to take vengeance upon Ölvir and Frakökk {{who were involved in}} the burning of his father. The earl consented to this request, and gave Sveinn two ships. Sveinn travelled south to Borgarfiörd, and then west to the trading place of Dúfeyrar. According to Anderson, Borgarfiörd may refer to the Moray Firth; and Dúfeyrar likely refers to the shore in the parish of Duffus, on the coast of Moray. The saga states that from Dúfeyrar, Sveinn travelled to Ekkialsbakki, and from there went to Atholl, where he met Earl Maddaðr. Anderson stated that Ekkialsbakki, in this case, likely refers to the coast on the Moray Firth, next to Atholl; The 19th-century historian William Forbes Skene agreed with this, specifically locating it to Findhorn, where ships could <b>enter</b> <b>an</b> estuary and follow a route into Atholl. However, Hermann Pálsson and Paul Geoffrey Edwards, in their 1981 translation of the saga, identified the town of Banff with Dúfeyrar, and the River Oykel with Ekkialsbakki.|$|E

5|$|Though uninvolved {{in foreign}} affairs, and {{therefore}} obliged to follow Britain's lead, the colony enthusiastically supported the mother country during the Second World War, symbolically affirming the British {{declaration of war}} before {{any other part of}} the Empire. During the ensuing conflict over 26,100 Southern Rhodesians of all races served in the armed forces, pro rata to white population a higher contribution of manpower than any other British colony or dominion, and more than the UK itself. George VI knighted Huggins in 1941, and, with the war still ongoing, Britain made overtures towards dominion status. Huggins dismissed this, saying it was imperative to win the war first. The idea of dominionship was raised again in 1952, but Salisbury once more did not pursue it, instead following the results of a referendum held early the next April to <b>enter</b> <b>an</b> initially semi-independent Federation with the directly administered British colonies of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.|$|E
5|$|Upon peaking in intensity, Julia {{accelerated}} {{slightly as}} it re-curved toward the northwest along a mid to upper-level low to its southwest. In addition, this system generated unfavorable southerly flow aloft, inducing a slight {{weakening of the}} storm. By early September16, Julia's eye became indistinguishable on satellite images, and the storm further dropped to below major hurricane status. Upon doing so, Julia became embedded within a south-southeasterly steering current along deep-layer ridging in its vicinity, resulting in a more westward track. Though still a hurricane, the relatively small tropical system moved {{to the east of}} the much larger Hurricane Igor. Concurrently, Igor's outflow began impinging on Julia's circulation, and due to colder sea surface temperatures, the storm weakened below hurricane intensity late on September17. Henceforth, Julia re-accelerated as it further curved northward around the contiguous ridge, nearly merging with Igor as a result. Progressively tracking to the north over the next hours, Julia subsequently executed a turn to the northeast, then to the east. Proceeding eastward, the low-level center of the storm became partially exposed on September 18; however, for several hours thereafter, convection gradually redeveloped over its center. Despite the deep convection, vertical wind shear again increased over the system, causing the storm to <b>enter</b> <b>an</b> extratropical transition. It is estimated Julia degenerated into a post-tropical low by 1800 UTC on September 20, while located about 1095mi (1750km) west of the Azores. The resultant storm meandered around over the Atlantic for several days, continuing generally eastward before executing an elongated loop to the south. Following this erratic track, the remnants of Hurricane Julia proceeded northwestward and came within 350mi (563km) of Bermuda, where they were once again briefly monitored by the NHC. However, chance of redevelopment dwindled, as conditions were not conducive for tropical formation; convection nearly diminished entirely, and the NHC discontinued monitoring the system on September 28.|$|E
