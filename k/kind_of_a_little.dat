"Before we {{get ready}} to go to sleep," [...] said Mrs. Aleshine, [...] "for, havin' no candles, I guess we won't sit up late, hadn't we better rig up some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sled to put in that hole, with strings at both ends, so that we kin send in mustard-plasters and {{peppermint}} to them poor people if they happen to be sick in the night?" ...|$|E

We came to this hotel because we knew you had been here, but we didn't suppose you were here! Well! This is too good! I saw Dick, Friday, but he didn't say anything about your sailing; I suppose he thought I knew. Didn't {{you tell me you}} were going in a week, that day in your house?" ...|$|E

Well, in about a minute things were running pretty tight, but all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sudden I see by Mr. Emerson's eye he judged he had 'em.

60|$|I {{had taken}} notice, in Captain Carton's boat, {{that there was}} a curious and quite new sort of fitting on board. It was a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bower made of flowers, and it was set up behind the captain, and betwixt him and the rudder. Not only was this arbour, so to call it, neatly made of flowers, but it was ornamented in a {{singular}} way. Some of the men had taken the ribbons and buckles off their hats, and hung them among the flowers; others had made festoons and streamers of their handkerchiefs, and hung them there; others had intermixed such trifles as bits of glass and shining fragments of lockets and tobacco-boxes with the flowers; so that altogether it was a very bright and lively object in the sunshine. But why there, or what for, I did not understand.|$|E
6000|$|Farmer Brown's boy {{understood}}. He understood perfectly {{that little}} people like Whitefoot want their homes hidden {{away in the}} dark. [...] "Poor little chap," [...] said Farmer Brown's boy."He had a regular castle here and we have destroyed it. He's got the snuggest <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> nest here, but he won't come back to it {{so long as it}} is right out in plain sight. He probably thinks we have been hunting for this little home of his. Hello! Here's his storehouse! I've often wondered how the little rascal could eat so much, but now I understand. He stored away here {{more than half of the}} good things I have given him. I am glad he did. If he hadn't, he might not come back, but I feel sure that to-night, when all is quiet, he will come back to take away all his food. I must do something to keep him here." ...|$|E
6000|$|It didn't take Peter long to find Pewee. He just {{followed}} {{the sound of}} that voice and presently saw Pewee fly out and make the same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> circle as {{the other members of the}} family make when they are hunting flies. It ended just where it had started, on a dead twig of a tree in a shady, rather lonely part of the Green Forest. Almost at once he began to call his name in a rather sad, plaintive tone, [...] "Pee-wee! Pee-wee! Pee-wee!" [...] But he wasn't sad, as Peter well knew. It was his way of expressing how happy he felt. He was a little bigger than his cousin, Chebec, but looked very much like him. There was a little notch in the end of his tail. The upper half of his bill was black, but the lower half was light. Peter could see on each wing two whitish bars, and he noticed that Pewee's wings were longer than his tail, which wasn't the case with Chebec. But no one could ever mistake Pewee for any of his relatives, for the simple reason that he keeps repeating his own name over and over.|$|E

He's {{not quite}} a dork or a geek but {{definitely}} would not be considered popular. However he is likely the most loyal of friends despite being {{a bit on the}} outer fringe of the circle. The wisecracking Kev has to reluctantly look the other way when Darian enters the picture, well aware of Tommy's relationship with her of which he does not approve.|$|R

It's just that I want you to know I'm going to give all of me to you now if I can get you to want me. And I am glad I knew Istra--she learnt me a lot about books and all, so I have more to me, or maybe will have, for you.

Cave later described it as, [...] "just <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> jokey <b>little</b> punctuation mark to the whole thing.
