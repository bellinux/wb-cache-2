5000|$|The Ohmer <b>fare</b> <b>register</b> was, {{in various}} models, a {{mechanical}} device for registering and recording the fares of passengers on streetcars, buses and taxis {{in the early}} 20th century. It was invented and improved by members and employees of the Ohmer family of Dayton, Ohio, especially John F. Ohmer who founded the Ohmer <b>Fare</b> <b>Register</b> Company in 1898, and his brother Wilfred I. Ohmer of the Recording and Computing Machines Company of Dayton, Ohio. This latter company employed up to 9,000 people at one time and was a major manufacturer of precision equipment during World War I. [...] It was subsequently renamed the Ohmer Corporation and in 1949, acquired by Rockwell Manufacturing.|$|R

5000|$|A Myki card can {{be either}} [...] "anonymous" [...] or [...] "registered". In addition, a Myki card can be issued as a child, seniors or general {{concession}} Myki, {{as well as a}} full fare passenger, allowing automatic calculation of concession <b>fares.</b> <b>Registered</b> Myki cards have some information held about the passenger by Public Transport Victoria, primarily to protect against loss of the Myki card itself (in which case the card is replaced by Public Transport Victoria, without the passenger being required to purchase a new card). Passengers with registered Myki tickets also have the ability to view their travel history, detailing their exact touch on and off times, as well as the service used, the zones travelled in and the fare charged. A $6 fee is charged for the issuance of a Myki card, with concession passengers paying a reduced $3 fee.|$|R

5000|$|... "The large {{grandstand}} held {{twelve hundred}} people, among them hundreds of ladies. The long semi-circular tiers of seats were black {{with men and}} boys, and hundreds were standing, unable to get seats. The commodious space for carriages was completely filled, {{and one or two}} May Day riding parties also graced that part of the grounds...Two <b>registering</b> <b>turnstiles</b> gates admit the patrons to the grounds, and as each ticket holder passes through the gate he steps on a raised platform, and by a mechanical arrangement is registered, and only one person can pass through the gate at a time. Near the gate are two ticket offices, and a large entrance through which the crowd can pass {{at the end of the}} game. At the southeast corner there is a large gate to admit carriages to the park. The ground, which contains nearly six acres of land, is enclosed by a fence twelve feet high. The diamond is as level as constant rolling by heavy stone and iron rollers can make it. Inside of the base lines is turfed, except a space nine feet in width, reaching from the pitcher's position to the home plate. Twenty-two feet are sodded outside of the diamond. Paths leading to and from the bases have been rolled hard, and the out-field is sown with grass seed. The grand stand which will seat nearly 1200 people, is 151 x 40 ft, and in the rear is raised 34 ft. The stand is reached by steps at both ends. It will be covered by canvass, requiring nearly 7000 ft. Seats are arranged in a circle at the eastern and western sides of the field. A platform 60 x 8 ft has been erected for the reporters, scorers and invited guests, seating nearly 60 persons. Under the grand stand for the visiting and local clubs are rooms 20 ft square and fitted up with wardrobes, dressing rooms 20 ft square, a wash room supplied with Pawtucket water, closet, etc. The Western Union Telegraph Company have a room 8 x 10 ft. There is a stockholders' room 20 ft square, and a refreshment saloon 40 x 20 to be managed by caterer Ardoene. A fence with gateways has been erected in front of the club rooms, thereby preventing the crowd from having any talk with the players. The grounds are without doubt as fine as any in the country, and Harry Wright said yesterday, 'They are beautiful." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lemuel got a conductor's {{overcoat}} and cap at half-price {{from a man}} who {{had been}} discharged, and put by the money saved to return to Sewell when he should come. He entered upon his duties the next morning, under the instruction of an old conductor, who said, [...] "Hain't I seen you som'ere's before?" [...] and he worked all day, taking money and tickets, <b>registering</b> <b>fares,</b> helping ladies on and off the car, and monotonously journeying back and forth over his route. He went on duty at six o'clock in the morning, after an early breakfast that 'Manda Grier and his mother got him, for Statira was not strong enough yet to do much, and he was to be relieved at eight. At nightfall, after two half-hour respites for dinner and tea, he was so tired that he could scarcely stand.|$|R
