500|$|During a {{world tour}} in 2001, the Malaysian {{government}} canceled the band's {{show in the}} nation's capital because the authorities had a negative perception of the group's image and music. The government pointed the band's mascot Vic Rattlehead as inappropriate and told the members {{that they would be}} arrested if they performed. Dave Mustaine responded: [...] "I recognize what the Malaysian government is trying to do, and it <b>is</b> <b>admirable</b> of them trying to protect the young people in the country. But it just shows the degree of ignorance and apathy that the government has toward the problem." ...|$|E
500|$|Representative Lee {{and other}} members of the Congressional Black Caucus called upon {{outgoing}} Louisiana Governor Blanco to pardon the Jena Six on December 19, 2007, stating that [...] "we believe Mychal Bell and the Jena 6 have paid a sufficient debt to society for any transgressions they may have committed." [...] Blanco's office responded that she cannot grant pardons without a recommendation from the state Pardon Board, and no meeting of that body was scheduled during her remaining term of office. Walters commented that Representative Lee's [...] "passion for racial equality <b>is</b> <b>admirable,</b> but her grasp of the facts is not." [...] He indicated that the attack on Barker was not just a schoolyard fight [...] "but rather an unprovoked, unforeseen assault on a young man who had nothing to do with the hanging of the nooses." [...] Governor Blanco's term of office ended without any pardons being granted.|$|E

500|$|In 1938 {{he joined}} the Old Vic theatre company, and {{appeared}} in several of their high-profile productions both at their home theatre and on tour throughout Britain and across {{the rest of the}} world. He appeared in Hamlet as Horatio opposite Alec Guinness in the title role, and as Alonso in John Gielgud's production of The Tempest. He played Mercutio in a production of Romeo and Juliet mounted by the Old Vic company at Streatham in 1939, with Robert Donat as Romeo. This was Morell's favourite role from his career. His performance in the play was praised by The Timess critic as [...] "a neat and carefully studied portrait; he <b>is</b> <b>admirable</b> in all his cynical and humorous passages", although the reviewer did add that [...] "one could wish that he had left this manner for the speech about Queen Mab and addressed this, as a piece of direct poetry, directly to the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Speechless" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Kitty Empire of The Observer gave a negative {{review of the}} song, noting that ballads are Gaga's [...] "weak point". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters noted similarities between the song and the music of Queen, adding, [...] "Although the resulting tune doesn't have the same driving oomph of a peak-era Queen number, the imitation <b>is</b> <b>admirable</b> if {{not just for the}} fact that it manages to rub shoulders with such sacred company without once feeling like a gimmick." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the song the lone [...] "dud" [...] from The Fame Monster, [...] "not because it's a bad song or poorly performed, but because, like on The Fame, when [...] does try to show her softer side, it comes off as a fraud—at least alongside the rest of her material." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic felt that the song had a [...] "galvanized Eurotrash finish" [...] to it, comparing the guitar playing in the song to the work of Noel Gallagher, the lead guitarist of Oasis.|$|E
500|$|Freehance writer Paul De Witte wrote a mixed {{review in}} The Record (now the Waterloo Region Record), writing that {{although}} the book [...] "will certainly find its audience, its Disneyesque sensibilities will kill its broader appeal. The topics of wildlife conservation and global ecological accountability warrant a depth that the author seems unwilling to give her book." [...] Kirkus Reviews referred to the book as [...] "an enlightening cautionary take" [...] and [...] "a charmingly personal account", but also as [...] "loosely organized and occasionally sparse on detail". John Wilkes, in the Los Angeles Times, wrote, [...] "Although naive and overdrawn at times, this heartfelt tale will bring tears and smiles {{to even the most}} stubbornly objective reader." [...] Donna Mitchell, writing in The Wilson Bulletin (now The Wilson Journal of Ornithology), wrote that Houle's interpretation of the falcons' behavior is excessively [...] "anthropomorphic", but also that [...] "Ms. Houle's perseverance and dedication to the protection of the Peregrine Falcon <b>is</b> <b>admirable</b> and an incentive not only to young biologists just getting started but {{to those of us who}} get a little more than discouraged with the struggle to protect endangered species and their habitats." ...|$|E

500|$|Around {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, the {{influence}} of Characters began to be exerted more explicitly, notably in the studies of critic A.C. Bradley, who approvingly adopted Hazlitt's explanation of the character of Iago. At about this time, George Saintsbury, who wrote a comprehensive history of English criticism (finished in 1904), recorded his extreme distaste for Hazlitt's character, and, as noted by critic Elisabeth Schneider, found his writings [...] "filled with vast ignorance, errors, prejudice, and an unpleasantness of temper amounting almost to insanity". Yet he also ranked Hazlitt high as a critic, among the greatest in the language. Characters he placed lower than some of Hazlitt's other critical works; yet he allowed that, aside from such [...] "outbursts" [...] as his railing against the historical King Henry V, and his over-reliance on quotation from Schlegel, Characters of Shakespear's Plays is filled with much that <b>is</b> <b>admirable,</b> notably Hazlitt's comparison of Chaucer's and Shakespeare's characterisation and his observation that Shakespeare [...] "has no prejudices for or against his characters". Saintsbury found Hazlitt's critical judgements sound as a rule, and he thought that the characterisations of Falstaff and Shylock were [...] "masterpieces".|$|E
2500|$|IGN later put Andrew Ryan {{at number}} 10 in {{their list of}} the Top 100 Videogame Villains, saying, [...] "The force of his {{personality}} and clarity of his vision <b>is</b> <b>admirable</b> throughout the game. Rapture wouldn't be nearly as interesting without Ryan and his complementing the action and exploration, shouting propaganda and taking every opportunity to broadcast his world view." [...] The PlayStation Official Magazine placed him as the eighth best videogame villain on PS3.|$|E
2500|$|The way {{the folk}} song [...] "Paadariyen" [...] merges with the Carnatic song [...] "Mari Mari" [...] <b>is</b> <b>admirable.</b> This is picturized {{in the film}} as a scene where Sindhu {{challenges}} JKB at a carnatic concert. Ilayaraaja {{is said to have}} believed that all the emotions, feelings and depth found in the carnatic songs are adequately, if not, equally available in the folk tunes. When Balachander is said to have narrated the situation to him that Sindhu sings a folk song and most unexpectedly switches to a carnatic tune. Within 24 hours he came with up the song which became the biggest controversy in his career, he faced staunch opposition from certain classical musicians for having changed the original raga from Khamboji to Saramati ...|$|E

2500|$|Dom Sinacola of Slant Magazine said, [...] "More than that, it furthers {{the general}} {{message of the}} whole album, which is that for all his posturing and charm, Glover may not have it in him to {{participate}} in the kind of bacchanalia required of his position as a young, burgeoning, multi-talented rap star. Halfway between throwaway wordplay and trenchant comment about fame, the lyric says a lot about where Glover's head is at: As a former sketch comedian, writer on 30 Rock, and star of the sitcom Community, he leans on his wit as his most formidable weapon." [...] Philip Cosores of Consequence of Sound stated, [...] "Yes, the dedication that Glover has seemingly displayed in the project <b>is</b> <b>admirable.</b> But he just doesn't seem to get music on this album. Maybe it's because of his taste, or because he is trying too hard to stand out, or because of his hubris, or because he has lost touch with reality, or maybe it is because of the internet." [...] Phillip Mlynar of Spin said, [...] "The only reaction that Because the Internet elicits is the uncontrollable urge to skip to the next song, in hopes that things couldn't possibly get any sloppier. But they do, beginning with the cod-wailing that blights [...] "Crawl" [...] and volleying with the psychedelic muzak of [...] "The Worst Guys" [...] (co-starring Chance the Rapper) and [...] "Zealots of Stockholm (Free Information)," [...] which sounds like Glover has inadvertently locked himself in his practice space and is attempting to muster up a loud enough mess so that some kindly passerby will hear his cries for help. As the album collapses into itself with the closing cut, [...] "Life: The Biggest Troll (Andrew Auernheimer)," [...] we're resigned to existence as a gloopy mess of random thoughts. [...] "Where's the line between Donny G and Gambino?" [...] the rapper muses, but it's unclear whether this is meant as a genuine identity crisis or an all-knowing middle finger to critics. Maybe the entire album is a meme itself, a grand existential joke critiquing the all-conquering rise of Internet culture by parodying its overwhelming randomness. Whatever it is, though, it's a bad rap record." ...|$|E

60|$|The wood-cut of Slay-good[2] <b>is</b> <b>admirable,</b> to be sure; {{but this}} {{new edition of}} the Pilgrim's Progress is too fine a book for it. It should be much larger, and on sixpenny coarse paper.|$|E
6000|$|This seventh Sermon <b>is</b> <b>admirable</b> throughout, Leighton throughout. O what a {{contrast}} might be presented by publishing some discourse of some Court divine, (South for instance,) preached {{under the same}} state of affairs, and printing the two in columns! ...|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>admirable.</b> Just a few {{spelling}} mistakes and slips, such as there generally are in automatic writing. But the style, the thought--all the essentials <b>were</b> <b>admirable.</b> After that, Inspiration came to me regularly. I wrote the whole of 'Humble Heroisms' like that. It was a great success, and so has everything been that I have written since." [...] He leaned forward and jabbed at Denis with his finger. [...] "That's my secret," [...] he said, [...] "and that's how you could write too, if you tried--without effort, fluently, well." ...|$|R
