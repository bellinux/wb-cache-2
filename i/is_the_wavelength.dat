5|$|Ocean {{surface waves}} are {{propagating}} oscillations {{caused by the}} drag and friction from air moving {{across the surface of}} the water. This friction transfers energy and forms surface waves in the water more or less in the direction of the wind. The top of a wave is known as its crest and its foot as its trough; the distance between two crests <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>wavelength.</b> These waves are mechanical: as they approach, the water at a given point rise up and, as they pass, the water goes down, with parcels of water tracing a roughly circular path. The energy is passed along with the wave at a much greater speed than the motion of the water itself.|$|E
5|$|A {{low-pass}} filter {{can be implemented}} quite directly from a ladder topology lumped-element prototype with the stepped impedance filter shown in figure 5. The filter consists of alternating sections of high-impedance and low-impedance lines which correspond to the series inductors and shunt capacitors in the lumped-element implementation. Low-pass filters are commonly used to feed direct current (DC) bias to active components. Filters intended for this application are {{sometimes referred to as}} chokes. In such cases, each element of the filter is λ/4 in length (where λ <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> of the main-line signal to be blocked from transmission into the DC source) and the high-impedance sections of the line are made as narrow as the manufacturing technology will allow in order to maximise the inductance. Additional sections may be added as required for the performance of the filter just as they would for the lumped-element counterpart. As well as the planar form shown, this structure is particularly well suited for coaxial implementations with alternating discs of metal and insulator being threaded on to the central conductor.|$|E
25|$|Which peak to use {{depends on}} the application. The {{conventional}} choice <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> peak at 25.0% given by Wien's displacement law in its weak form. For some purposes the median or 50% point dividing the total radiation into two halves may be more suitable. The latter {{is closer to the}} frequency peak than to the wavelength peak because the radiance drops exponentially at short wavelengths and only polynomially at long. The neutral peak occurs at a shorter wavelength than the median for the same reason.|$|E

Spectral type O7 was defined to be {{the point at which the}} two intensities are equal, with the He I line weakening towards earlier types. Type O3 was, by definition, the point at which said line disappears altogether, although it can be seen very faintly with modern technology. Due to this, the modern definition uses the ratio of the nitrogen line N IV λ4058 to N III λλ4634-40-42.|$|E

If light were not quantized into photons, the uncertainty [...] could be made arbitrarily small by reducing the light's intensity. In that case, since the wavelength and intensity of light can be varied independently, one could simultaneously determine the position and momentum to arbitrarily high accuracy, violating the uncertainty principle. By contrast, Einstein's formula for photon momentum preserves the uncertainty principle; since the photon is scattered anywhere within {{the aperture}}, the uncertainty of momentum transferred equals ...|$|E
