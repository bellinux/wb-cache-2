40|$|Trapped atomic ions {{have become}} one of the most {{promising}} architectures for a quantum computer, and current effort is now devoted to the transport of trapped ions through complex segmented ion trap structures in order to scale up to much larger numbers of trapped ion qubits. This paper covers several important issues relevant to ion transport in any type of complex multidimensional rf (Paul) ion trap array. We develop a general theoretical framework for the application of time-dependent <b>electric</b> fields to <b>shuttle</b> laser-cooled ions along any desired trajectory, and describe a method for determining the effect of arbitrary shuttling schedules on the quantum state of trapped ion motion. In addition to the general case of linear shuttling over short distances, we introduce issues particular to the shuttling through multidimensional junctions, which are required for the arbitrary control of the positions of large arrays of trapped ions. This includes the transport of ions around a corner, through a cross or T junction, and the swapping of positions of multiple ions in a laser-cooled crystal. Where possible, we make connection to recent experimental results in a multidimensional T junction trap, where arbitrary 2 -dimensional transport was realized. ...|$|R
40|$|Overheating of <b>electric</b> cables on <b>shuttle</b> cars {{has long}} been {{recognized}} {{as a cause of}} premature insulation failure leading to shock and electrocution. Use of cable reels on shuttle cars can cause excessive heat build up which, in turn, causes the cable insulation to soften and become easily damaged This heat-softened insulation reduces the life of the cable. Repeated cycling of a cable in this manner can cause premature aging of the insulation; it becomes bridle, cracks and allows electrical leakage paths to farm. These leakage paths provide the opportunity for shock and electrocution to occur if miners come in contact with the damaged section of cable. It is imperative that cable operating temperatures be maintained at safe thermal limits. This paper discusses a research project conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Research Center to determine dynamically the conductor temperature of reeled shuttle car cables using fiber optics technology. The research portrays typical shuttle car loading cycles (both current and time cycles). Root-mean-square current loading is calculated based on the results. The thrust of this effort is to provide the scientific basis for ampacity derating factors specifically for mine machinery using reeled cables This information will reduce the probability of electrical hazards from reeled cable...|$|R
