40|$|In modern societies, {{structured}} {{as representative}} democracies, all rights {{to some extent}} {{are related to the}} right to information: the enlargement <b>of</b> participation in <b>citizenship</b> presupposes an enlargement of the right to information as a premise. It is a right which encourages the exercising <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> and aﬀ ords the citizens access to and criticism of the instruments necessary for the full exercising <b>of</b> the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> rights. The right to information can have characteristics of emancipation or of tutelage. An emancipating right is a right to freedom, a right whose basic presupposition is freedom of choice. Accordingly, the maxim which could sum up the ethical issue of the right to information would be: give maximum publicity to everything which refers to the public sphere and keep secret that which refers to the private sphere...|$|R

The BIA {{also noted that the}} Cherokee Nation had excluded the Cherokee Freedmen from voting on the amendment. On this issue, the Cherokee Nation Supreme Court ruled that the Cherokee Nation could take away the approval authority which it had previously granted the federal government. Pending the resolution of litigation, the Cherokee Freedman had all rights as full Cherokee Nation citizens, including voting rights and access to tribal services. In early 2011, the tribal district court ruled that the special election in 2007 on the constitutional amendment was unconstitutional, as it excluded Freedmen from voting. [...] The Nation appealed.

Why we should rediscover citizenship {{at the end of the}} twentieth century is an interesting question in itself but not one for consideration here. Instead I shall consider what this rediscovery means for disabled people in general and, in particular, what implications it might have for our education system in general, and the post-school sector in particular. While politicians, policy makers and educators have rediscovered the notion <b>of</b> <b>citizenship,</b> disabled people have begun to redefine disability not as personal tragedy requiring therapy but as collective oppression requiring political action. Thus, for the former <b>group,</b> the history <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> can be seen as the achievement of certain political, social and civil rights for everyone. For the latter, disability is nothing less than the denial of basic human rights to certain groups within society...|$|R

He writes that states {{have the right to}} transfer (or withdraw from) territory, even against the wishes of the population, or to revoke the <b>citizenship</b> <b>of</b> inhabitants. The Lieberman Plan advocates the affected Arab Israelis to become citizens of Palestine, not stateless, and hence doesn't violate 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.

He points to the expulsion of black Senegalese from Mauritania, the stripping of northern Muslims <b>of</b> their <b>citizenship</b> by Côte d'Ivoire and the denationalization of Germans from Czechoslovakia (whose legality, he says, was later upheld in courts). Waters also argues that while the transfer of Israeli Arabs to a Palestinian state would harm their interests (e.g. reduction in standard of life) it doesn't violate any of their human rights.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 The body of {{literature}} surrounding the concept <b>of</b> social <b>citizenship</b> developed in the mid- 20 th century {{in order to address}} social inequality in Western democracies. The concept drew on human rights literature to argue that states should indeed provide a modicum of social and economic security to their citizens. Social citizenship literature has been the basis of many studies on the institutionalization of the welfare state, and some scholars have suggested that such social policies have in large part discriminated against some on the basis of race, class, gender and other social characteristics. How might we understand citizenship while recognizing the social inequality present within political and social institutions? A transformative model <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> must recognize that the formation of the citizen-subject is a social process. The citizen-subject {{is a reflection of the}} actions of the state and the rest of society. Although inequality is experienced by many citizens within political and social institutions, I argue that we can still identify those points at which citizenship is performed by citizen-subjects who articulate new forms of ‘being’ within their everyday lives. I further show how citizens engaged within social movements and group organizations participate in a process of becoming that reflects social citizenship. In particular, I showcase how changes in group formations develop through a politics of becoming organized in the Packinghouse Workers Organizing Committee (PWOC) of Chicago from the years 1918 - 1940. By participating in a politics <b>of</b> becoming, <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> citizens put forth new articulations of being that have an effect on our material world through <b>group</b> performances <b>of</b> social <b>citizenship...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> competences <b>of</b> Dutch adolescents, including {{the political and social}} aspects as part of adolescents' daily lives. We followed 5070 adolescents aged 12 - 16 years across a three-year period in lower secondary education. The variance on school and student level was estimated and a three-level mixed-effects regression model was fit to analyze differences in citizenship development. The results indeed show development <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> competences during secondary school, but the observed patterns were not always positive. Students generally showed an increase in their citizenship knowledge, but a decline in their societal interest, prosocial ability and reflective thinking. Differences between <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> students could be explained by both schools and student characteristics. Especially girls and minority students developed the most citizenship competences. Understanding these differences is important for schools to improve their practices in ways that support the development <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> competences <b>of</b> various <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> students...|$|R
40|$|Children have an {{unsettled}} {{relationship with}} the status <b>of</b> <b>citizenship,</b> being given some rights, responsibilities and opportunities for participation, and being denied others. Yet if <b>citizenship</b> is conceived <b>of</b> as a practice, children can be firmly seen as citizens {{in the sense that}} they are social actors, negotiating and contributing to relationships of social interdependence. This article develops understandings of children’s agency in <b>citizenship</b> and some <b>of</b> the different ways in which children’s actions enact them as interdependent citizens. It presents one aspect of the understanding <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> generated from research by six <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> marginalised children, aged 5 - 13, in Wales and France. Synthesising the research groups’ descriptions of activities they associated with the component parts <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> with citizenship theory, these children can be seen to engage in actions <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> that include making rules of social existence, furthering social good and exercising freedoms to achieve their own rights. Their activities also transgress the boundaries of existing balances of rights, responsibilities and statuses, through their (mis) behaviour, in ways that can be interpreted as Acts <b>of</b> <b>citizenship.</b> In children’s everyday activities, however, the distinction between actions and Acts <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> can at times be blurred. This is because recognizing aspects of children’s practices as citizenship is a challenge to dominant definitions <b>of</b> <b>citizenship,</b> and claims a new status for children. Exploring children’s citizenship in these ways has potential for widening understandings of participation and appreciating broader aspects of children’s agency in citizenship...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{political}} thought has bequeathed two conceptions <b>of</b> <b>citizenship,</b> one {{leading to a}} conception <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> as participation in civil society {{and the other a}} view <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> as a legal status based on rights and generally defined with respect to the state as opposed to civil society. In republican political theory, from classical thought through the Renaissance to the Enlightenment, citizenship has been largely associated with the idea of the participation of the public in the political life of the community. This has given rise to a strong association <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> with civil society and in general with a definition <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> that stresses "virtue", the active dimension of what membership of a political community entails. In contrast to this, in fact, quite old tradition, the liberal idea <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> is one that emphasises citizenship as a largely legal condition. In this understanding <b>of</b> <b>citizenship,</b> which had its origins in English seventeenth-century political theory, citizenship concerns the rights of the citizen.

Researching this theme {{under the aegis of}} the Violence, Participation and <b>Citizenship</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Citizenship</b> DRC coordinated by IDS, we generated some answers, but also more questions, which this paper starts to explore. Why have democratisation processes failed to fulfil expectations of violence reduction in the global South? How does violence affect democracy and vice versa? Why does security practice in much of the global South not build secure environments? When examined empirically from the perspectives of poor Southern citizens, the interfaces between violence, security and democracy – assumed in conventional state and democratisation theory to be positive or benign – are often, in fact, perverse. Empirically-based reflection on these questions leads us to two propositions, which the paper then explores through the use of secondary literature. In essence: Proposition 1 : Violence interacts perversely with democratic institutions, eroding their legitimacy and effectiveness. Democracy fails to deliver its promise of replacing the violence with accommodation and compromise, and democratic process is compromised, with citizens reacting by withdrawing from public spaces, accepting the authority of non-state actors, or supporting hard-line responses. Proposition 2 : Security provision is not making people feel more secure. State responses to rising violence can strengthen state and non-state security actors committed to reproducing violence, disproportionately affecting the poorest communities...|$|R
