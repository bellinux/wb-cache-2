5|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> <b>to</b> embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.|$|E

25|$|Some theorists, such as Martin Khor of the Third World Network, {{point out}} that many {{developing}} nations have gone from being food independent to being net food importing economies since the 1970s and 1980s International Monetary Fund (and later the World Trade Organisation's Agreement on Agriculture) free market economics directives to debtor nations. In opening <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> <b>to</b> developed world food imports subsidised by Western governments, developing nations can become more dependent upon food imports if local agriculture does not improve.|$|E
25|$|Minimum {{wages are}} used widely in <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> <b>to</b> protect {{vulnerable}} workers, reduce wage inequality, {{and lift the}} working poor out of poverty. The political popularity of minimum wages stems {{in part from the}} fact that the policy offers a means for redistributing income without having to increase government spending or establish formal transfer mechanisms. The challenge to policymakers is to find that wage level that is considered fair given workers' needs and the cost of living, but does not harm employment or a country's global competitiveness.|$|E

Cubans built housing, roads, airports, schools and other facilities in Angola, Ethiopia, Laos, Guinea, Tanzania and other countries. By the end of 1985, 35,000 Cuban workers had helped build projects in some 20 Asian, African and Latin American countries.|$|E
25|$|Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) have {{investigated}} the potential impacts climate change could have on agriculture, and how this would affect attempts at alleviating poverty in the developing world. They argued that the effects from moderate climate change {{are likely to be}} mixed for developing countries. However, the vulnerability of the poor in <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> <b>to</b> short term impacts from climate change, notably the increased frequency and severity of adverse weather events is likely to have a negative impact. This, they say, should be taken into account when defining agricultural policy.|$|E
25|$|ECLAC {{states that}} in order to create better {{economic}} relations globally, international lending agencies must work with <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> <b>to</b> change how and where credit is concentrated as well as work towards accelerating financial development in developing countries. ECLAC further suggests that the United Nations expand its agenda to work more rigorously with international lending agencies and that they become more inclusive of all nations. Key factors in achieving universal competition is the spread of knowledge at the State level through education, training and technological advancements. Economist Jagdish Bhagwati suggested that programs to help developing countries adjust to the global economy would be beneficial for international economic relations.|$|E
