25|$|Barry Collins of The Sunday Times {{appreciated}} the website's plain-language event adding feature, {{but did not}} appreciate that {{he was unable to}} see more than one month of events at a time. Collins was also unhappy that the website was not capable of warning him when he had two events scheduled at the same time. In a list of the best web-based calendar software for small businesses, Forbes ranked 30 Boxes second, after Google Calendar. They described 30 Boxes like “buying a new car with manual transmission and lots of extras—you don't just want to drive <b>it,</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to fool around with it to see what it can do”.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} [...] "No Russian" [...] was {{conceived}} {{during the initial}} brainstorming sessions for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 plot. The developers at Infinity Ward wanted to discuss how terrorists operate in the modern era, and sought to create an unimaginable, albeit plausible scenario that the player would feel uncomfortable in. Lead writer Jesse Stern noted that despite the grim subject matter, people instinctively {{want to know what}} it is like to experience these attacks, and cited documentaries about the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the Columbine High School massacre as evidence. According to Stern: [...] "These are human beings who perpetrate these acts, so you don't really want to turn a blind eye to <b>it.</b> <b>You</b> <b>want</b> to take it apart and figure out how that happened and what, if anything, can be done to prevent it. Ultimately, our intention was to put you as close as possible to atrocity." ...|$|E
500|$|U2 {{found that}} they were neither {{prepared}} nor well-rehearsed, and that their ideas were not evolving into completed songs. The group were unable to reach consensus during their disagreements and {{felt that they were}} not making progress. Bono and Lanois, in particular, had an argument that almost came to blows during the writing of [...] "Mysterious Ways". During one tense session, Clayton removed his bass guitar and held it out to Bono, saying, [...] "You tell me what to play and I'll play <b>it.</b> <b>You</b> <b>want</b> to play it yourself? Go ahead." [...] With a sense of going nowhere, the band considered breaking up. Eno visited for a few days, and understanding their attempts to deconstruct the band, he assured them that their progress was better than they thought. By adding unusual effects and sounds, he showed that the Edge's pursuit for new sonic territory was not incompatible with Mullen's and Lanois' [...] "desire to hold on to solid song structures". Ultimately, a breakthrough was achieved with the writing of the song [...] "One". While working on [...] "Sick Puppy"—an early version of [...] "Mysterious Ways"—The Edge played two separate chord progressions sequentially on guitar at Lanois' encouragement, and finding inspiration, the group quickly improvised a new song that became [...] "One". It provided reassurance and validated their long-standing [...] "blank page approach" [...] to writing and recording together.|$|E

2500|$|Three adult geocachers, a 24-year-old {{woman and}} her parents, were trapped in a cave and rescued by firefighters in Rochester, New York, while searching for an ammo can in 2012. Rochester Fire Department {{spokesman}} Lt. Ted Kuppinger said, [...] "It's difficult because you're invested in <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to find something like that so people will probably try to push themselves more than they should {{but you need to}} be prudent about what you're capable of doing." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 20 Y.O. was {{recorded}} chiefly at Jam and Lewis' Flyte Tyme Studios in Los Angeles and Dupri's Southside Studios in Atlanta, with some sections undertaken at The Village in Los Angeles and the Hit Factory in Miami. The concept of 20 Y.O. {{is a celebration}} {{of what was happening}} musically when Control was released. The addition of Dupri, quotes Jackson as saying, [...] "It's an edge, an attitude, an exciting vibe that's assertive. It's about taking charge. It says, 'Here I am. I'm coming on. Musically, I have <b>it.</b> <b>You</b> <b>want</b> it. And I'm giving it to you.'" [...] With the album Dupri wanted to reconnect Jackson with her urban fan base without losing her pop and dance audience she had built during the last two decades before the album's release. [...] "Times have changed from when Michael and Janet were out in the '80s", he noted, pointing to the fact that urban artists no longer had to cross over to pop genres before achieving maximum exposure and sales. [...] "Janet shouldn't be changing or trying to change to get on pop radio", the producer completed.|$|E
