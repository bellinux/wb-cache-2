25|$|David Brooks theorises in his 2011 book, The Sons of Clovis: Ern Malley, Adoré Floupette and a Secret History of Australian Poetry, {{that the}} Ern Malley hoax was {{modelled}} on the 1885 satire on French Symbolism and the Decadent movement, Les Déliquescences d'Adoré Floupette by Henri Beauclair and Gabriel Vicaire.

25|$|Most {{of these}} regions are settled with prosperous and {{contented}} people. However, this naturally {{is lacking in}} scope for plot.

Many <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of Ozma, making it impossible for them to acknowledge her as their rightful queen. These regions are concentrated {{around the edges of the}} country, and constitute the main settings for books that are set entirely within Oz. The Lost Princess of Oz, for instance is set entirely in rough country in Winkie Country, between two settled areas. In Glinda of Oz, Ozma speaks of her duty to discover all these stray corners of Oz.|$|E

25|$|At 20 {{months of}} age, when {{presented}} with three familiar objects (e.g., a ball, a bottle and a cup) and one unfamiliar object (e.g., an egg piercer), children are able to conclude that in the request “Can I have the zib,” zib must refer to the unfamiliar object, i.e., the egg piercer, even if they <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> that pseudoword before. Children as young as 15 months can complete this task successfully if the experiment is conducted with fewer objects. This task shows that children aged 15 to 20 months can assign meaning to a new word after only a single exposure. Fast mapping is a necessary ability for children to acquire {{the number of words}} they have to learn during {{the first few years of}} life: Children acquire an average of nine words per day between 18 months and 6 years of age.|$|E
25|$|In the Harry Potter books, the Ministry's {{employees}} {{appear to}} be a largely unelected body. The post of Minister itself, however, is stated to be an elected position. Who has the power to elect or dismiss ministers is never explained. Nevertheless, both the Minister and the Ministry as a whole are seen throughout the Harry Potter series to be highly sensitive to (and reliant on) wizard public opinion, which they attempt to influence via wizarding newspapers. The most functional newspaper is the Daily Prophet, which gives reliable information about politItaly knowledge, and advertisements. Another reliable news source is Witch Weekly, although it focuses less on politics and prison trials than celebrities and advertisements and Quidditch Season. A less than reliable source is the Quibbler, which gives no advertisements, and focuses on fake news, for instance, saying that a star Quid ditch player didn't break his leg, but was bitten by a creature most people <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of. In the books, employment with the Ministry can be obtained right after completion of a wizarding education, though different offices require different levels of education and sometimes specific exam results.|$|E
25|$|In his What About Those Who <b>Have</b> <b>Never</b> <b>Heard?</b> Sanders tells a {{story about}} a college student who {{rejected}} Christianity because, he claimed, it “damns to hell all those who never hear about Jesus.” Sanders replied that though some Christians held that position there are several other views which have been affirmed by Christians throughout history. In his book, No Other Name, he discusses a range of views affirmed by Christians. Sanders coined the term “restrictivism” for the view that Christian salvation is possible only for those who have heard about the gospel of Jesus and put their faith in Jesus prior to their death. Those who die without knowing about Jesus cannot inherit eternal life. The second view he discusses is universalism (or apokatastasis) according to which every human who has ever lived will be redeemed. Between these polar views are what Sanders calls the “wider hope” and he spends the most time on two views in this category. One is what he calls eschatological evangelization or postmortem salvation. In this view if a person dies without having heard of Jesus then he or she will encounter Jesus after death and be provided an opportunity to put their faith in Jesus. The final position Sanders covers is the one he affirms: inclusivism. The unevangelized are saved by the work of Jesus if they respond in faith to God based on the revelation they have available.|$|E

500|$|Bardulf {{was known}} for his legal expertise, which led to him being one of the few justices {{mentioned}} by name in Glanvill, an early medieval English legal text, although whether by the original author or by a glossator, is unclear. His long career as a justice helped create a sense of continuity in judicial matters through the reigns of the Angevin kings. He remained on such good terms with Hubert Walter, that when Walter was appointed chancellor at the beginning of John's reign, Bardulf made a comment to the new chancellor that included a pointed barb about the last Archbishop of Canterbury to also be chancellor, Thomas Becket. Bardulf was on good enough terms {{that he was able to}} tease Walter that [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> nor seen an archbishop become a chancellor, but we have seen a chancellor become an archbishop." ...|$|E
500|$|Another 1901 piece led {{to one of}} Mr. Dooley's {{most famous}} quotations. A number of {{lawsuits}} brought {{in the wake of}} the 1898 war dealt with the issue of whether the Constitution applied with full force in the former Spanish colonies annexed by the United States, none of which had been granted an organized government by Congress. This question was known as whether the Constitution follows the flag. In 1901, the United States Supreme Court decided these lawsuits, known as the Insular Cases. The justices' written opinions were difficult to understand, and the court deeply divided, but the net effect was to hold that the Constitution did not follow the flag. The decisions gave Mr. Dooley an opportunity to puncture the court's ivory-tower reputation, [...] "no matter whether the constitution follows the flag or not, the Supreme Court follows the election returns". The phrase has often been quoted, sometimes by people who <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of Mr. Dooley.|$|E

500|$|Cyber Rights {{received}} a positive review in Salon, which noted, [...] "Readers of 'Cyber Rights' will range {{from those who}} <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of Mike Godwin {{to those who have}} tangoed with him online at some point or have at least lurked silently as the debate raged. Whatever the number in the first category, those falling into the second are legion. Godwin has been online so long he's had a celebrated law that predicts the course of online discussions named after him." [...] The review observed, [...] "Throughout 'Cyber Rights,' it becomes clear that what makes Godwin a sometimes unpleasant online sparring partner is precisely what has catapulted him to the front lines in the seemingly endless battles for free speech on the Net. ... his tenacity and his insistence on wrestling every last breath out of his opponents' arguments." [...] Salon characterized the book as, [...] "an instructional book with an argument to convey – a sort of cross between a dry, textbookish primer and a lively personal history." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the 1979 NFL Draft, new [...] San Francisco 49ers {{head coach}} Bill Walsh flew to Morehead State with {{assistant}} coach Sam Wyche {{to work out}} Simms. Walsh was so impressed {{that he planned to}} draft Simms in the third round, preferring him over the quarterback they ultimately took, Joe Montana of Notre Dame. But the New York Giants decided to make Simms their first round pick (seventh overall) to the surprise of many. As Simms acknowledged, [...] "most people <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of me." [...] When Simms's name was announced by Commissioner Pete Rozelle in front of the audience at the draft in New York, his selection was booed loudly by the Giants fans in attendance. (He was the second quarterback taken; Jack Thompson of Washington State went to Cincinnati with the third overall pick.) Simms was not happy being a Giant either, [...] "All I was thinking was which teams I would rather play for—the Green Bay Packers, the Kansas City Chiefs, San Diego, San Francisco..." [...] Nonetheless, he became popular with his teammates who jokingly dubbed him [...] "Prince Valiant" [...] in his rookie training camp.|$|E

500|$|For the U.S. and its allies, {{the victory}} in the Tenaru battle was psychologically {{significant}} in that Allied soldiers, {{after a series of}} defeats by Japanese Army units throughout the Pacific and east Asia, now knew that they could defeat the Imperial Armies in a land battle. [...] The battle also set another precedent that would continue throughout the war in the Pacific, which was the reluctance of defeated Japanese soldiers to surrender and their efforts to continue killing Allied soldiers, even as the Japanese soldiers lay dying on the battlefield. On this subject Vandegrift remarked, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> or read of this kind of fighting. These people refuse to surrender. The wounded wait until men come up to examine them...and blow themselves and the other fellow to pieces with a hand grenade." [...] Robert Leckie, a Guadalcanal veteran, recalls the aftermath of the battle in his book Helmet For My Pillow, [...] "Our regiment had killed something like nine hundred of them. Most lay in clusters or heaps before the gun pits commanding sandspit, as though they had not died singly but in groups. Moving among them were the souvenir hunters, picking their way delicately as though fearful of booby traps, while stripping the bodies of their possessions." ...|$|E

In the United Kingdom, [...] "Lovebird" [...] was given an impact date of 9 December 2012, meaning it was only available to purchase as an album track rather than a traditional separate single release. In the chart week immediately after, [...] "Lovebird" [...] sold fewer than 600copies, meaning it failed to attain one of 200chart positions on the UK Singles Chart. As a result, [...] "Lovebird" [...] became Lewis' lowest selling single of her career thus far, and her first release to not chart in the UK. According to the Mirror there was [...] "no real marketing force" [...] behind the single and it [...] "failed to capture the imagination of radio bosses". The newspaper concluded that [...] "most people, unless they have the album, <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> the song" [...] and {{this was due to}} a lack of airplay.|$|E
500|$|One of Young's first actions was to hire Ray Perkins as head coach. Perkins was an {{offensive}} assistant coach on the Dallas Cowboys under Hall of Fame coach Tom Landry. In his first draft, Young drafted quarterback Phil Simms from Morehead State University with the seventh overall draft pick {{to the surprise}} of many. Simms had never played on a winning team at Morehead State, and acknowledged after he was drafted that [...] "ost people <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of me." [...] Young was certain of the choice though saying, [...] "nce in a while {{you get a chance to}} get a guy with a great arm and great potential and you'd darn sight better take it." [...] Simms was unhappy with the selection, and had other teams which he favored playing on over the Giants. The Giants lost their first five games of the season with Joe Pisarcik starting at quarterback. Simms came on in relief of Pisarcik in the fifth game and started the next four, all of which the Giants won. They lost five out of their last seven however, finishing 6–10 for the year. They fell to 4–12 in 1980. Simms play was inconsistent, as he combined for 28 touchdowns against 33 interceptions while completing 48.8% of his passes over his first two seasons.|$|E
