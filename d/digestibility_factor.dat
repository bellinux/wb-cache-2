40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) and milk thistle seed (MTS) on some apparent ileal morphology and digestibility variables in the small intestines of broilers. A total of 216 Ross 308 male broiler chickens were allocated in a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement of the treatments with three concentration of AFB 1 (0, 250, and 500 ppb) and three levels of MTS (0, 5, and 10 g kg- 1). On day 35, the birds that received diets with 500 ppb of AFB 1 alone (main effect) showed significant decrease in apparent ileal digestibility [dry matter (DM; 72. 46 ± 0. 27), calcium (Ca; 40. 81 ± 1. 11), crude protein (CP; 29. 42 ± 1. 89), apparent digestible energy (2653 ± 58. 82) ], ileal morphology [villus length (VL; 822. 5 ± 7. 47), villus width (VW; 90. 16 ± 2. 17) and ratio of VL to crypt depth (VL/CD; 4. 74 ± 0. 07) ] in their ileum segments (P< 0. 01). However, the mean nitrogen (N; 61. 39 ± 0. 48) and crypt depth (CD; 173. 5 ± 9. 87), in the ileum were significantly greater for the birds that were fed with 500 ppb AFB 1 alone in their diets {{when compared with the}} control (P< 0. 01). Also, thistle seeds can ameliorate the toxic effects of AFB 1 on some ileal <b>digestibility</b> <b>factors,</b> that is, DM, N, Ca, and CP, in broiler chicks. Nevertheless, ileum morphology of VW and goblet cell numbers were not affected negatively by the AFB 1 plus MTS in diets. The results of this study indicated that the use of MTS independently reduced the toxic effects of AFB 1, facilitated the absorption of nutrients, and reduced the metabolic demands of the intestinal tract in broiler chickens...|$|R
40|$|The health related {{importance}} of dietary fibre {{as part of}} a balanced diet is well known. More recently, soluble fibres, such as (1 → 3, 1 → 4) -β-D-glucan (β-glucan), have been shown to influence glycaemic, insulin and cholesterol responses to foods. Barley is a rich source of β-glucan; however, consumption of products containing barley grain or flour is often limited by their negative organoleptic quality. A potential solution lies in the use of barley as an extraction source for β-glucan fractions. One problem with regards to this is the lack of clarity on the use of barley β-glucan fractions in food systems, particularly their physiological and physico-chemical properties. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the potential of barley β-glucan fractions as functional ingredients in cereal foods. The effects of extraction treatment on fraction composition and physico-chemical properties were investigated. Subsequently, barley β-glucan fractions (from a bench-top and commercial extraction procedure and of differing molecular weight) were incorporated into white wheat bread and durum wheat semolina pasta. The effects on product quality and in vitro starch digestibility were investigated. Simultaneously, the effect of processing on the degradation of β-glucan molecular weight was evaluated. Different extraction treatments may influence the composition and physico-chemical properties of barley β-glucan fractions. The inclusion of barley β-glucan fractions in bread and pasta resulted in a slight reduction of product quality but generally reduced the rate and extent of in vitro starch <b>digestibility.</b> <b>Factors</b> such as composition, water retention capacity, integration within the cereal food matrix and molecular weight may influence the behaviour of the fractions. Bread manufacture resulted in degradation of β-glucan molecular weight, although only high molecular weight β-glucans were susceptible to degradation. The results of the study have both scientific and commercial value and provide foundations for further development of barley β-glucan enriched cereal products.

40|$|Many {{sources of}} protein have been {{investigated}} to reduce the use of fish meal (FM) in aquaculture feeds, including soybean meal (SBM). However, FM replacement in feeds for carnivorous species is limited by problems with feed intake, growth rate, and overall health associated with reduced <b>digestibility</b> and anti-nutritional <b>factors</b> found in SBM. However, soy processing strategies can reduce the effects of anti-nutritional factors and improve utilization. Therefore, we examined the possibility of further FM replacement in SBM maximized feeds for hybrid striped bass using refined soy products, soy protein concentrate (SPC) and soy protein isolate (SPI). Results indicate that further FM sparing is possible, beyond what can be achieved with SBM. For example, {{it is possible to}} reduce dietary FM content as low as 5 % using SPC, and though this negatively affects growth rate, this effect may be reversed by the addition of a betaine-based attractant. Replacement with SPI resulted in such a degree of feeding reluctance that starvation and cannibalization became issues during the trial. Reducing FM content below 5 - 10 % resulted in more variable production performance and, when using SPI, increased incidence of cannibalism. No differences in stress tolerance were observed during the trials; however, there was a trend of increasing handling mortality in fish fed the SPC diets. Refined soy proteins can be used in conjunction with SBM to spare FM, but the cost of these products, along with their acceptability to aquatic livestock, will determine the extent of their utilization in aquafeeds...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The aims of this {{introductory}} {{article are}} to survey and critically evaluate the concepts and approaches {{that have been}} used to assess amino acid adequacy and to hypothesize about possible future directions of research. The issue in question is extensive, consequently this article will be limited to: 1) definitions of amino acid requirements; 2) available techniques to assess amino acid requirements; 3) actual recommendations for healthy adults; 4) factors influencing requirements; and 5) requirements in acute and chronic wasting diseases. Recommendations for amino acid intakes for healthy adults were proposed by the FAO/WHO expert committee in 2001. They have not yet been published. The major factors affecting amino acid requirements are the stage of development, reproductive state, environmental <b>factors,</b> <b>digestibility</b> of dietary proteins, genotype of the individual, and pathological conditions. Remarkably, there are no conclusive data relative to changes in requirements induced by infection, injury, trauma, and renal or liver failure. Future research using modern methods to evaluate requirements must thus receive a high priority. Wasting diseases are associated with deficiencies and imbalances of particular amino acids causing specific changes in requirements. Consequently, a new approach has been used to categorize amino acids as conditionally indispensable according to their functional and physiological properties. Kinetic measurements of plasma amino acids might help to estimate qualitative requirements. Measurement of tissue intracellular free amino acid deficiencies or excesses is another method to estimate qualitative requirements. Based on these measurements tentative values for conditionally indispensable amino acids during disease are given in the article. J. Nutr. 134 : 1558 S– 1565 S, 2004.

40|$|Supported by the CGIAR System-wide Livestock ProgrammeAs systems intensify, {{crops and}} {{livestock}} become increasingly integrated. Forage from crops becomes a larger component of overall forage supply in small-scale systems. This paper integrates information from field trials, studying the effect of varying maize planting density, with modelling approaches to compare this with supplementation of maize stover, genetic improvement of stover digestibility and replacement of the maize crop with planted forage in east and southern Africa. Aggregate analyses for small-scale intensive (SSI) systems producing milk were carried out using a suite of models including CERES, CROPGRO, DRASTIC and ANORAC, scaling-up to regional level using GIS information. Increasing planting density increased the yield of thinnings, but decreased grain and stover yields. Model predictions of milk production from the thinnings and stover produced from one hectare of maize indicated that economic benefits to increased planting density could be achieved when the grain:milk price ratio was low, despite the negative effect on grain yield. Supplementation showed the greatest economic returns with small positive impacts on soil fertility and maize production. Replacing maize with planted forage inevitably increased milk {{at the expense of}} maize production. Again, for this intervention, grain:milk price ratios ranging from 0. 19 to 2. 88 across sub-Saharan Africa are likely to influence the decision of the farmer whether or not to trade milk for grain. Genetic enhancement of the digestibility of maize stover was found to have little impact on milk production because diets based on stover were deficient in nitrogen, preventing animals from benefiting from the increased energy supply resulting from <b>digestibility</b> increases. Other <b>factors</b> such as market access and stability, as well as individual objectives such as cash flow, food security and risk minimisation, were not explored in the present study but will influence household decisions.

40|$|Au cours de 4 années d’expérimentation avec des vaches laitières, différents hybrides de maïs choisis pour leur valeur énergétique mesurée sur moutons {{standards}} ont été comparés en ensilage de la plante entière. Les hybrides dont la valeur énergétique estimée sur les moutons était la plus élevée permettent des productions de lait standard supérieures de 1 à 2 kg et des reprises de poids pouvant atteindre 300 g de plus par jour. Les écarts de quantités de matière sèche d’ensilage ingérées ont également atteint 1, 5 kg à teneur en matière sèche et teneur en grain constantes. Si les mesures faites sur moutons, comme les mesures de solubilités enzymatiques, permettent nettement de distinguer les hybrides à bonne valeur énergétique des hybrides à faible valeur énergétique, elles ne permettent en revanche pas de classer correctement les hybrides au sein de chacun de ces deux groupes. Enfin, aucune des mesures effectuées sur moutons ou {{in vitro}} ne permet de prédire la variabilité observée pour l’ingestibilité. Genetic {{variation in the}} feeding efficiency of different maize genotypes was evaluated from experiments with dairy cows. The maize genotypes were chosen according to their variable digestibility range, determined in previous experiments with standard sheep. The variations in milk yield observed with dairy cows fed a low, respectively a high, digestible or energizing hybrid were between 1 to 2. 0 kg per animal, per day. Moreover, the differences in body weight gain reached up to 300 g per day. Hybrids having similar energy values acted similarly on milk yield, but the intake could be very different when fed to dairy cows, even if no difference in intake was observed in sheep measurements. The 1. 5 kg higher silage maize intake of DK 265 was mostly converted into a body weight gain, and not in increasing the milk yield, probably because the milk yield potentiel of the animals was soon reached. It appeared that the hybrids which had a low predicted energy value from the sheep measurements also had a lower performance in cows. Dairy cow performances also appeared to concur with the enzymatic solubility values of the whole plant. However, only good hybrids could be distinguish from poor ones, but the variation within good, respectively poor, hybrids could not reliably be investigated with the enzymatic solubility test used. The variation in ingestibility could not be predicted. For maize breeders, the prediction of an hybrid efficiency for use in dairy cow rearing must include <b>digestibility</b> and ingestibility <b>factors.</b> Enzymatic processes could probably be used to avoid drift towards poor feeding values with hybrids bred for a higher stalk strength. The most important challenge for maize breeders {{will most likely be}} the determination of a criterium for the intake prediction. The stover digestibility and starch content can be reliably predicted through the use of NIRS (near infra-red reflectance spectroscopy) calibrations. For a stock-breeder, a pertinent choice of a maize hybrid might allow significant concentrates and money saving...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Native {{rapeseed}} (NRS) is {{planted in}} some parts of Iran because of climatic condition. The consumption of NRS in animal nutrition is limited by anti-nutritional such as phytic acid and glucosinolate. Moreover, the protein of NRS is highly degraded by rumen microorganisms. Several processing methods have been used to enhance the nutritive value of whole oilseeds, including extrusion, roasting, toasting and Jet-Sploding. However, most heat processing methods adversely affect protein digestibility in the small intestine. Recently, other processing methods such as processing by gamma and microwave irradiation have been noticed. Therefore, this research was carried out to evaluate the effects of gamma irradiation (15, 30 and 45 kGy) and microwave irradiation (800 W) for 2, 4 and 6 min on ruminal dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) degradability, in vitro CP <b>digestibility,</b> anti-nutritional <b>factors</b> (glucosinolate and phytic acid) and chemical composition of NRS. Materials and Methods Chemical composition (DM, CP, EE and Ash) of untreated and irradiated NRS was determined by AOAC methods. Then, sufficient water was added to the sample to increase the moisture content to 250 g/kg. Gamma irradiation was completed by using a cobalt- 60 irradiator at 20 ºC. The dose rate determined by Fricke dosimetry was 0. 36 Gy/s. Another three samples (500 g each) were subjected to microwave irradiation at a power of 800 W for 2, 4 and 6 min. Phytic acid and glucosinolate contents of untreated and irradiated samples were determined by standard methods. Degradation kinetics of DM or CP were determined according to in situ procedure. Six grams of untreated or irradiated NRS were incubated in the rumen of three ruminally fistulated Taleshi bulls for 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 48 h. Bags were placed in the rumen just before the bulls were offered their first meal. After retrieval from the rumen, bags were thoroughly washed with tap water until the rinsing water was clear. The same procedure was applied to two bags to obtain the 0 h value. The residues were dried and analyzed for DM and CP to determine degradation kinetics of NRS. Digestibility of rumen undegraded CP was estimated using the three-step in vitro procedure. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to monitor protein subfractions and the fate of true proteins of untreated and irradiated NRS in the rumen. Results and Discussion Irradiation had no significant effect on chemical composition, but decreased the total glucosinolate and phytic acid of NRS. This elimination of phytic acid by irradiation is probably due to chemical degradation of phytate to lower inositol phosphates and inositol, by the action of free radicals, which have lower chelating power, or cleavage of the phytate ring itself. The glucosinolate content of untreated NRS in this study, 122. 8 mol/g, was reduced up to 30 kGy, but further irradiation had no effect. Major deleterious effects of glucosinolate ingestion in animals include: reduced palatability, decreased growth and reduced production. However, according to our study, gamma and microwave irradiated NRS may be fed to dairy cows at high levels without glucosinolate induced detrimental effects. Gamma and microwave irradiation decreased the washout fraction, degradation rate and effective degradability (ED) of DM and CP and increased potentially degradable fraction of DM and CP of NRS. Decreasing CP degradability as a result of irradiation is due to the occurrence of cross-linking of polypeptide chains, denaturation and protein aggregation. Gamma irradiation at doses of 30 and 45 kGy and microwave irradiation increased in vitro CP digestibility of NRS. Irradiation may induce unfolding of the protein and its denaturation, thereby exposing hydrophobic amino acids (especially aromatics) that are positional groups for the active sites of pepsin and trypsin enzymes. Moreover, the improvement in CP digestibility may be attributed to reduction of phytic acid. Electrophoresis results indicated that major proteins of NRS were cruciferin (globulin 12 S) and napin (Albumin 2 S). Electrophoresis results indicated that in untreated NRS, three subunits of cruciferin and in gamma and microwave irradiated NRS, three subunits of cruciferin and two subunits of napin consisted of bypass proteins. Conclusion In conclusion, gamma irradiation at doses of higher than 15 kGy and microwave irradiation more than 2 min reduced ruminal degradability of CP, increased in vitro CP digestibility and reduced anti-nutritional factors of NRS. Subsequently, in vivo studies are required to investigate effect of feeding irradiated feedstuff on lactation performance of dairy cows...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{increasing}} requirements for foods to be fortified with vitamins, particularly folic acid, the relative instability of these essential nutrients is a significant concern. Microencapsulation offers unrealised potential as a means to enhance retention, if the inherent challenges of this approach can be overcome. Currently {{there is a lack of}} effective ways to evaluate the release characteristics of microencapsulated materials. Accordingly the objectives of this study have been to investigate the microencapsulation of folic acid and to study the application of in vitro digestibility analyses as a means to establish the retention and release properties of the resultant microcapsules. Procedures for analysis of carbohydrates were validated for use in the study of digestibility and dinitrosalicylic acid reagent was used to measure reducing sugar release. This gave a reliable means of assaying degree of digestion and the results were confirmed by comparisons with HPLC analyses of component sugars. A dialysis model was adapted for evaluation as a way to analyse <b>digestibility</b> and the <b>factors</b> influencing this system were investigated. As starches are potential microencapsulation agents, the focus has been on the in vitro digestion of starch granules. The activity of a number of α-amylase preparations showed significant dependency on the presence of CaCl 2 while the type of dialysis tubing used did not impart significant effects on results. In a direct comparison of α-amylases, different rates of reducing sugar were observed in the dialysis model with the animal source giving highest rate followed by bacterial and finally the fungal source. The effects on surface morphology of the granules showed similar patterns of pitting, channelling and endo-corrosion followed by complete collapse of the structure. The formulation and production of microcapsules by spray drying was investigated with focus on selected binding agents alginate (ALG) and low-methoxy pectin (LMP) in conjunction with rice starch granules. The effect of simultaneously varying the ratio and level of binding agents gave a surface plot that indicated higher folic acid retention with a decrease in LMP. As a means of strengthening the outer shell of the microcapsules, a secondary treatment with CaCl 2 was applied and generally, a hardening of the microcapsule surface was observed with the environmental scanning electron microscope. The CaCl 2 treatment time did not affect the folic acid loss while the ratio of binding agent Abstract vi particularly the sole presence of ALG lead to a higher loss of the core material during hardening. As a compromise between core material recovery and subsequent loss during calcium treatment, a combination of 1 % of 1 : 1 LMP:ALG was shown to give optimum core material retention. When the in vitro digestion model was applied to the microcapsules, the release of both reducing sugars and folic acid was significantly reduced for the Ca 2 + treated microcapsules as compared to untreated controls. Morphologically, both types of samples showed some collapse of structure but a more cohesive cluster was observed from Ca 2 + treated microcapsules corresponding to enhanced retention of the core material. These findings demonstrate the potential of the microencapsulation strategy including calcium treatment as an effective way to retain sensitive core materials. This is the first systematic study of an in vitro digestion model as an effective means of assessing physiological release of core materials. In addition to contributing to the standardisation of in vitro digestibility procedures, the proposed model can now be adapted and extended to evaluation of capsular release of a wide range of food systems. ...|$|R
40|$|Greenhouse gas (GHG) {{emissions}} from agriculture now exceed {{emissions from}} land use, land use change and forestry, including deforestation, and are {{growing at a}} rate of about 1 % per year (Tubiellio et al. 2015). The main livestock emission sources – enteric fermentation, manure management and manure deposited on pasture – account for 62 % of all agriculture emissions (FAOSTAT). Submitted national inventories show that livestock emissions account for an average of 9 % of gross GHG emissions in all developing countries, but exceed 20 % of gross emissions in more than a third of developing countries. Future increase in demand for livestock products is expected to drive livestock GHG emissions higher. At the same time, however, the GHG emission intensity (tCO 2 e per tonne of livestock product) has been falling with the enhanced productivity and efificency of livestock systems (Caro et al. 2014) and is expected to continue to fall. Productivity and efficiency gains are important ways to meet increasing demand for livestock products while limiting impact on the global climate system (Gerber et al. 2013, Havlík et al. 2014). As part of their contribution to the Paris Agreement, 92 developing countries included livestock-related emissions in the scope of their INDCs, including 48 that explicitly mentioned intentions to reduce emissions from livestock- related sources (enteric fermentation, manure management and biogas, grasslands and silvopastoral systems). Seventeen countries have proposed livestock mitigation policies and measures such as Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). Associated with these plans is growing interest in improving measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of livestock emissions (Box 1). Guidance from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for compilation and reporting of national GHG inventories provides methodological options for estimating livestock GHG emissions (IPCC 1996, IPCC 2006). Tier 1 methodologies use fixed values for GHG emissions per head of livestock, so this quantification approach can only reflect changes in livestock populations. Tier 2 methodologies – which require more detailed information on different categories of animal and data on livestock weight, weight gain, feed <b>digestibility</b> and other <b>factors</b> – are better able to capture the effects of changes in management on GHG emissions. However, only 5 of 140 developing countries have adopted a Tier 2 approach that can routinely capture changes in productivity and efficiency of livestock systems in reporting to the UNFCCC. Another 16 developing countries are currently using a Tier 2 approach to calculate country- and system-specific emission factors, but their reporting systems are unable to capture ongoing changes in productivity that affect emission factors and emission intensity over time. Within this context, CCAFS, the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases (GRA) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), with support from the New Zealand government, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the World Bank, embarked on a study of current MRV practices and opportunities for improvement. The study focused on three areas: 1. Do current livestock GHG emission MRV practices meet countries’ policy needs? 2. What are the common barriers to improving MRV of livestock GHG emissions? 3. How can international organizations support improvements in MRV of livestock GHG emissions? UNIQUE Forestry and Land Use GmbH conducted a desk study and interviews. At a CCAFS-GRA-FAO-World Bank workshop in Rome in February 2017, 32 experts from developing and developed countries deliberated on a draft discussion paper, providing further insights on countries‘ priority concerns, constraints and plans. This info note summarizes key findings from the process; full results are published in a CCAFS report by Wilkes et al. (2017) "Measurement, reporting and verification of livestock GHG emissions by developing countries in the UNFCCC: current practices and opportunities for improvement" [URL]...|$|R
