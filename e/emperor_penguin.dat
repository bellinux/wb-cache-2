5|$|In {{addition}} to the cold, the <b>emperor</b> <b>penguin</b> encounters another stressful condition on deep dives—markedly increased pressure of up to 40 {{times that of the}} surface, which in most other terrestrial organisms would cause barotrauma. The bones of the penguin are solid rather than air-filled, which eliminates the risk of mechanical barotrauma.|$|E
5|$|Several other {{journeys}} {{were completed}} during Scott's absence. Royds and Bernacchi travelled for 31days on the Barrier in a SE direction, observing its uniformly flat character and making further magnetic readings.

5|$|The average yearly {{survival}} rate of emperor penguins has been measured at 95.1%, {{with an average}} life expectancy of 19.9years. The same researchers estimated that 1% of emperor penguins hatched could feasibly reach an age of 50years. In contrast, only 19% of chicks survive {{their first year of}} life. Therefore, 80% of the <b>emperor</b> <b>penguin</b> population comprises adults five years and older.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014 a {{study by}} the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution {{concluded}} that <b>emperor</b> <b>penguins</b> are at risk from global warming, which is melting the sea ice. This study predicted that by 2100 all 45 colonies of <b>emperor</b> <b>penguins</b> will be declining in numbers, mostly due to loss of habitat.

500|$|<b>Emperor</b> <b>penguins</b> {{are able}} to breed at around three years of age, and usually {{commence}} breeding around one to three years later. The yearly reproductive cycle begins {{at the start of}} the Antarctic winter, in March and April, when all mature <b>emperor</b> <b>penguins</b> travel to colonial nesting areas, often walking [...] inland from the edge of the pack ice. The start of travel appears to be triggered by decreasing day lengths; <b>emperor</b> <b>penguins</b> in captivity have been induced successfully into breeding by using lighting systems mimicking seasonal Antarctic day lengths.|$|R

5|$|The <b>emperor</b> <b>penguin</b> is {{a social}} animal in its nesting and its {{foraging}} behaviour; birds hunting together may coordinate their diving and surfacing.

5|$|Some {{species of}} marine animals exist and rely, {{directly}} or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes penguins, blue whales, orcas, colossal squids and fur seals. The <b>emperor</b> <b>penguin</b> {{is the only}} penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the Adélie penguin breeds farther south than any other penguin. The southern rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes.

Here we report the Wrst {{investigation into the}} eVects of changes in wind speed and ambient temperature on diVerent components of penguin huddling behaviour. We attached light and temperature recorders to male <b>emperor</b> <b>penguins</b> at the Pointe Géologie colony, Antarctica, which recorded huddling events. We then compared the frequency, duration, occurrence and intensity of huddling bouts, with ambient air temperatures and wind speeds. Huddling occurrence increased with lower ambient temperatures and higher wind speeds, whereas huddling intensity was mainly enhanced by lower ambient temperatures. Moreover, huddling group movements were linked to wind direction and its global density to lower ambient temperatures.

5|$|The emperor penguin's dark plumage fades {{to brown}} from November until February (the Antarctic summer), before the yearly moult in January and February. Moulting is rapid in this species {{compared}} with other birds, taking only around 34days. <b>Emperor</b> <b>penguin</b> feathers emerge from the skin after they have grown {{to a third of}} their total length, and before old feathers are lost, to help reduce heat loss. New feathers then push out the old ones before finishing their growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} been bred outside Antarctica at SeaWorld San Diego; more than 20 {{individuals}} have hatched there since 1980. Considered a flagship species, 55 individuals were counted in captivity in North American zoos and aquaria in 1999. The first <b>emperor</b> <b>penguin</b> was hatched at Laohutan Ocean Park in Dalian in northeastern China in August 2010. In Japan, {{the species is}} housed at Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium and Wakayama Adventure World, with successful hatching in the latter place.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} discoveries of major {{scientific}} importance. These included the snow-free Dry Valleys {{in the western}} mountains, the <b>emperor</b> <b>penguin</b> colony at Cape Crozier, scientific evidence that the Ice Barrier was a floating ice shelf, and a leaf fossil discovered by Ferrar which helped to establish Antarctica's relation to the Gondwana super-continent. Thousands of geological and biological specimens had been collected and new marine species identified. The location of the South Magnetic Pole had been calculated with reasonable accuracy. On the medical side, Wilson discovered the anti-scorbutic effects of fresh seal meat, which resolved the lethal threat of scurvy to this and subsequent expeditions.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn birds, {{courtship}} {{is generally}} short {{relative to the}} whole breeding cycle. <b>Emperor</b> <b>penguins</b> (Aptenodytes forsteri), however, are an exception as their courtship period is much longer (ca. 6 weeks) than the courtship of other penguin species. This strategy may appear surprising, as it is especially costly to fast and endure drastic climatic conditions for long periods at the colony (1. 5 and up to 4 months for females and males, respectively). We examined here the reasons of this extended courtship period and found that <b>emperor</b> <b>penguins</b> returned earlier to the colony when primary oceanic production before breeding was high. This suggests that <b>emperor</b> <b>penguins</b> return to the colony as soon as primary oceanic production in summer allows them to replenish their body reserves. The {{extended period of time}} spent at the colony during courtship may therefore result from an evolutionary process that confers advantages to <b>emperor</b> <b>penguins</b> that arrive earlier at the colony by reducing predation risks and offering better chances of securing a partner...|$|R

5|$|Together {{with the}} {{similarly}} coloured but smaller king penguin (A. patagonicus), the <b>emperor</b> <b>penguin</b> {{is one of}} two extant species in the genus Aptenodytes. Fossil evidence of a third species—Ridgen's penguin (A. ridgeni)—has been found in fossil records from the late Pliocene, about three million years ago, in New Zealand. Studies of penguin behaviour and genetics have proposed that the genus Aptenodytes is basal; in other words, that it split off from a branch which led to all other living penguin species. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggests this split occurred around 40million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The emperor penguin's diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, although its composition varies from population to population. Fish {{are usually the}} most important food source, and the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) makes {{up the bulk of}} the bird's diet. Other prey commonly recorded include other fish of the family Nototheniidae, the glacial squid (Psychroteuthis glacialis), and the hooked squid species Kondakovia longimana, as well as Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The <b>emperor</b> <b>penguin</b> searches for prey in the open water of the Southern Ocean, in either ice-free areas of open water or tidal cracks in pack ice. One of its feeding strategies is to dive to around , where it can easily spot sympagic fish like the bald notothen (Pagothenia borchgrevinki) swimming against the bottom surface of the sea-ice; it swims up {{to the bottom of the}} ice and catches the fish. It then dives again and repeats the sequence about half a dozen times before surfacing to breathe.|$|E

5|$|As {{the species}} has no fixed nest sites that {{individuals}} {{can use to}} locate their own partner or chick, <b>emperor</b> <b>penguins</b> must rely on vocal calls alone for identification.

25|$|King {{penguins}} and emperor penguins also do {{not build}} nests; instead, they tuck their eggs and chicks between their feet and folds of skin on their lower bellies. They are thus able to move about while incubating, though in practice only the <b>emperor</b> <b>penguin</b> regularly does so. Emperor penguins breed during the harshest months of the Antarctic winter, and their mobility allows them to form huge huddled masses which help them to withstand the extremely high winds and low temperatures of the season. Without the ability to share body heat (temperatures in the centre of tight groups can {{be as much as}} 10C above the ambient air temperature), the penguins would expend far more energy trying to stay warm, and breeding attempts would probably fail.|$|E
