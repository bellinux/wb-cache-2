In 1994 former Vichy official Paul Touvier (1915–1996) was convicted of crimes against humanity.

6000|$|... "Before I say a word," [...] Mrs. Forsyth said, after saying some {{hundreds}} {{in their}} mutual <b>inculpation</b> and exculpation, [...] "I {{want to ask}} something, and I hope you will excuse it to an old woman's curiosity and not think it rude." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know! I {{suspect that}} he's been {{involving}} himself in some ridiculous love affair!" [...] Mrs. Sewell looked a silent <b>inculpation.</b> [...] "It's largely conjecture on my part, of course,--he's about as confiding as an oyster!--but I fancy I have said {{some things in}} a conditional way that will give him pause. I suspect from his manner that he has entangled himself with some other young simpleton, and that he's ashamed of it, or tired of it, already. If that's the case, I have {{hit the nail on}} the head. I told him that a foolish, rash engagement was better broken than kept. The foolish marriages that people rush into are the greatest bane of life!" ...|$|E
60|$|There was no {{one else}} whom she could appeal to. Mrs. Lander, after her first warning, had not spoken of him again, though Clementina could feel in the grimness with which she {{regarded}} her variable treatment of him that she was silently hoarding up a sum of <b>inculpation</b> which would crush her under its weight when it should fall upon her. She seemed to be growing constantly better, now, and as the interval since her last attack widened behind her, she began to indulge her appetite with a recklessness which Clementina, in a sense of her own unworthiness, was helpless to deal with. When she ventured to ask her once whether she ought to eat of something that was very unwholesome for her, Mrs. Lander answered that she had taken her case into her own hands, now, for she knew more about it than all the doctors. She would thank Clementina not to bother about her; she added that she was at least not hurting anybody but herself, and she hoped Clementina would always be able to say as much.|$|E
60|$|Having a high idea of his {{official}} importance, and rather an exalted notion {{of his personal}} consequence, his honour saw nothing from that time but cords and daggers before his eyes, and never stepped {{out of his own}} house, which he fortified, and in some measure garrisoned, with half-a-dozen tall watchmen and constables, without seeing himself watched by a Papist in disguise, with a drawn sword under his cloak. It was even whispered, that, in the agonies of his fears, the worshipful Master Maulstatute mistook the kitchen-wench with a tinderbox, for a Jesuit with a pistol; but if any one dared to laugh at such an error, he would have done well to conceal his mirth, lest he fell under the heavy <b>inculpation</b> of being a banterer and stifler of the Plot--a crime almost as deep as that of being himself a plotter. In fact, the fears of the honest Justice, however ridiculously exorbitant, were kept so much in countenance by the outcry of the day, and the general nervous fever, which afflicted every good Protestant, that Master Maulstatute was accounted the bolder man and the better magistrate, while, under the terror of the air-drawn dagger which fancy placed continually before his eyes, he continued to dole forth Justice in the recesses of his private chamber, nay, occasionally to attend Quarter-Sessions, when the hall was guarded by a sufficient body of the militia. Such was the wight, at whose door, well chained and doubly bolted, the constable who had Julian in custody now gave his important and well-known knock.|$|E
6000|$|The amusements {{provided}} for these throngs {{of people were}} not different from those {{provided for}} throngs of people everywhere, who must be of much the same mind and taste the world over. I had fine moments when I moved in an illusion of the Midway Plaisance; again I was at the Fete de Neuilly, with all of Paris but the accent about me; yet again the county agricultural fairs of my youth spread their spectral joys before me. At none of these places, however, was there a sounding sea or a mountainous chute, and I made haste to experience the variety these afforded, beginning with the chute, since the sea was always there, and the chute might be closed for the day if I waited to view it last. I meant only to enjoy the pleasure of others in it, and I confined my own participation to the ascent of the height from which the boat plunges down the watery steep into the oblong pool below. When I bought my ticket for the car that carried passengers up, they gave me also a pasteboard medal, certifying for me, [...] "You have shot the chute," [...] and I resolved to keep this and show it to doubting friends as a proof of my daring; {{but it is a}} curious evidence of my unfitness for such deceptions that I afterwards could not find the medal. So I will frankly own that for me it was quite enough to see others shoot the chute, and that I came tamely down myself in the car. There is a very charming view from the top, of the sea with its ships, and all the mad gayety of the shore, but of course my main object was to exult in the wild absurdity of those who shot the chute. There was always a lady among the people in the clumsy flat-boat that flew down the long track, and she tried usually to be a pretty girl, who clutched her friends and lovers and shrieked aloud in her flight; but sometimes it was a sober mother of a family, with her brood about her, who was probably meditating, all the way, the <b>inculpation</b> of their father for any harm that came of it. Apparently no harm came of it in any case.|$|E

5000|$|The charges {{filed against}} the accused {{included}} mentions of [...] "counterrevolutionary crimes" [...] and organized action meant to [...] "topple, undermine, or weaken the Soviet Union." [...] Additionally, the <b>inculpation</b> revealed that the investigation uncovered evidence that the accused had used the JAC {{as a means for}} spying and promoting anti-government sentiment. The indictment went on to assert that the accused had been enemies of the government prior to their involvement with the JAC, and that the JAC served as their international network for communicating anti-Soviet views.|$|E
5000|$|The chief prosecutor, Bulot, {{prohibited}} the press from reproducing the interrogatories of Jean Grave and Sébastien Faure, leading Henri Rochefort to write, in L'Intransigeant, that the criminal association concerned not the defendants, but the magistrates and the ministers. The defendants easily discharged {{themselves of the}} <b>inculpation</b> of [...] "criminal association", since {{at that time the}} French anarchist movement rejected the sole idea of association and acted exclusively as individuals. Despite this, the president of the court, Dayras, dismissed all objections from the defense, leading Sébastien Faure to say:"Each time we prove the error of one of your allegations, you declare it unimportant. You may very well sum up all zeros, but you can't obtain a unity." ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine whether}} the firm’s {{transparency}} affects the credit {{spread of the}} firm’s bonds. After controlling for structural variables, I find {{that the quality of}} the firm’s transparency has on average a significant and negative impact on the credit spread. The last period has shown many structural changes and has stressed the precision of financial and accounting reports precisely after the Enron, Arthur Andersen, and WorldCom scandals. The most important measure which characterizes the last period is the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley Act in U. S. in July, 30 th 2002. This Act leads to the <b>inculpation</b> of the firm’s manager in the case of false report an...|$|E
40|$|Using as a {{point of}} {{departure}} a brief consideration of the characteristically unstable relationships between such codes as comedy and satire within genre theory, this essay goes on to apply those criticai concerns to a reading of the work of the Renaissance dramatist Ben Jonson, with particular reference to his comedy Bartholomew Fair. It is argued that this text fully confirms a tendency, already discernible in some of his previous comedíes, for Jonson's certaintíes as a satirist to be drastically questioned. Contributions from social history and anthropology are brought in to help account for the replacement of satiric <b>inculpation</b> by an exculpatory perspective deeply rooted in the understanding and in the dramatic/theatrical practice of comedy...|$|E
40|$|The Latin phrase nemo tenetur seipsum accusare means roughly “no man has {{to accuse}} himself. ” It {{is the basis of}} our rights against self {{incrimination}} and forced <b>inculpation.</b> It protects against three practical problems associated with confessions: (1) untrustworthy confessions; (2) involuntary confessions; and (3) confessions provoked through unacceptable force. This article argues that the Nemo tenetur principle was intended primarily to avoid the third problem: confessions obtained through improper methods. It examines the arguments for and against justifying the principle as a protection against either untrustworthy or involuntary confessions. The article also develops a framework to aid in the identification of improper methods of interrogation. Finally, it concludes by applying this framework to three hypothetical cases and arguing that only confessions obtained through unacceptable force should be barred...|$|E
40|$|Joint {{enterprise}} principles {{have extended}} accomplice liability {{to establish a}} form of guilt by association. Judicial sleight of hand has been adapted, in general, to common design rationale, {{and it has been}} used as a prosecutorial expedient towards establishing derivative <b>inculpation.</b> The pro-prosecution bias attached to joint enterprise doctrine is self-evident, and courts have zealously favoured its application as an inculpatory tool. This article focuses on extant law relating to fault elements for homicide within common design, and comparatively reviews alternative juridical precepts. New proposals are adduced on appropriate fault thresholds levels that ought to be supererogatory to satisfy the specific intention offence definitional element for a murder conviction. The debate then extends to review withdrawal principles as part of reverse conduct prophylaxis. A new restatement is chartered that identifies imputed normative proportionality for withdrawal, penitent motive, and reverse burden of persuasion as key factorisations...|$|E
40|$|After {{they had}} taken the {{fortress}} of Zimpi on the Gallipoli Peninsula in 1352 and then the strategic fortress of Gallipoli itself {{on the shores of}} the Dardanelles in 1354, the Turks for the first time crossed over onto and became masters of European soil. From then on, in the centuries to come, the Ottomans became the European nightmare, and Turkophobia, the contra Turcas theme and Marulić’s call to prayer “suprotiva Turkom” (“against the Turks”) resounded in speeches and epistles, dedicatory and poetic epistles and elegies as the inaugural and general agitatio actualis genera of Croatian and European humanism. Renowned Croatian humanists sent them in their roles as high dignitaries of the church, diplomats of the state, court envoys and orators, as prisoners of the Turks and eye-witness who had survived some disaster, advocates of a Turkish war and of inter-national peace, as grieving poets and journalists, to European monks and popes from the Croatian bastion of Christianity. Their speeches and epistles work in the context of experience, ideas, knowledge and persuasion, as shown by the collection of Speeches against the Turks of the Split Literary Circle (Logos, Split 1983). There are references in this work to the speeches, epistles and texts of the humanists of the north Croatian circle before and after Marko Marulić and his contemporaries, to whom the author refers (Ivan Vitez of Sredna, Ianus Pannonius Vitez, Nikola of Modruπ, Stjepan Brodarić and Bartol Đurđević), but these items are not included in that book. A relationship is established between the speeches and epistles to Pope Adrian VI of Toma Niger Mrčić and Duke Bernardin Frankopan, and particularly of Marko Marulić, with the speeches and epistles of Stjepan Brodarić, who survived the battle of Mohacs. In these, placing his confidence in the genuine authority and pastoral attitude of Adrian VI, {{in the name of the}} king and of his people, women and children, with an invocatory message of unexampled acerbity and <b>inculpation</b> he ad-dresses the Pope directly and strikes at the disharmony among the greater European havens of tranquillity in the defence of our cause. His views about the fate of the Croatian people “endowed with the misfortune” to fall defending itself, and to be accused for their casualties, is knowing and prophetic. With the published “genuine description” of Mohacs Field, Brodarić’s speeches and his epistle to the Pope exist in their meaning and the responses to them as a memorandum, in their lastingness as monument, and in the inheritance of them as testament...|$|E
