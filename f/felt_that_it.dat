5|$|After Quatermass and the Pit Kneale <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was time}} to rest the character. By the early 1970s he had decided there were new avenues to explore, and the BBC planned a fourth Quatermass serial in 1972. The BBC did not proceed with the project, and Kneale's scripts were {{produced}} in 1979 as a four-part serial for Thames Television titled Quatermass.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{continued}} to use rotoscoping in American Pop, Hey Good Lookin', and Fire and Ice, Bakshi later regretted his use of rotoscoping, stating that he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was a mistake to}} trace the source footage rather than using it as a guide.|$|E
5|$|Kana Hanazawa {{stated that}} she was happy to have been {{selected}} to be in Steins;Gate as she <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not common {{to be able to}} play a part in a serious game. She also thought that the game gives the player more of a thrilling sensation rather than a frightening one and it entices the player to continue reading.|$|E
5000|$|An August-September 2006 Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research poll on {{abortion}} {{to save the}} life of the mother found that 20% of Nicaraguans <b>felt</b> strongly <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should be [...] "legal", 49% <b>felt</b> somewhat <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should be [...] "legal", 18% <b>felt</b> strongly <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should be [...] "illegal", and 10% <b>felt</b> somewhat <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should be [...] "illegal".|$|R

5|$|The episode closes {{with music}} from The Avengers. After the music had been recorded, Scully <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> did not suit the ending and so wished {{to change it}} to {{something}} else. However, {{it was too late}} in production to get the full orchestra back to do a recording, and union rules meant that previous recordings could not be reused.|$|E
5|$|There {{was some}} criticism, {{as well as}} confusion, {{regarding}} {{the title of the}} film. Many reviewers, including James Rolfe, <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should have officially been titled Rocky VI, and that simply adding his last name to the end made it seem like it was a remake of the original film rather than a sequel.|$|E
5|$|While Queen Maya <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{the time}} to give birth, she went to the Lumbini park outside the Kapilavastu city. She stood under a plaksa tree, holding one branch with her right hand, and she gave birth to a son, Prince Siddhartha. The story on the panels {{continues}} until the prince becomes the Buddha.|$|E

5|$|A {{music video}} {{was created to}} {{accompany}} the song featuring Gaga. It portrayed her and Knowles {{in a number of}} costumes, brandishing colorful guns towards men and paying homage to the film Reservoir Dogs and pinup legend Bettie Page. It received mixed feedback from critics who called it un-interesting, and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> did not present anything new. However, they complimented the costumes and the cinematic homage of the video. The video {{went on to win the}} BET award for Video of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Although Brumund's {{publication}} included {{drawings of}} Borobudur, the Batavia Society still <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was incomplete. In April 1873, van Kinsbergen {{set off to}} the monument. Cleaning, digging and other technical difficulties delayed his start in taking pictures until August that year. The wet monsoon season further hampered his work, resulting {{in a series of}} only 43 photographs taken between August to December. The Society was disappointed with the number of photographs, although satisfied with the printing and artistic quality.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Mühe was married to his third wife, stage actress Susanne Lothar, and living in Berlin with her and their two children, Sophie Marie and Jakob. Mühe and Lothar starred {{together}} in Mühe's last film, Nemesis (2010), which deals with a couple's troubled relationship. However, Lothar, who died in 2012, launched a lawsuit to block the film from release for nearly three years, apparently because she <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would cast the couple in a bad light.|$|E

5|$|Bohr became {{convinced}} that light behaved like both waves and particles, and in 1927, experiments confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis that matter (like electrons) also behaved like waves. He conceived the philosophical principle of complementarity: that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties, such as being a wave or a stream of particles, depending on the experimental framework. He <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not fully understood by professional philosophers.|$|E
5|$|Brashear has {{represented}} the United States on two separate occasions. He made his international debut at the 1997 World Championship, where he registered two goals and five points in eight games, helping the Americans to a sixth-place finish. He later {{noted that he}} {{was surprised by the}} invitation, but <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> gave him an opportunity to show he could play other roles besides being an enforcer. He played for the U.S. again the following year at the World Championship, playing in six games and accumulating ten penalty minutes as the Americans finished in 12th place.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was generally positive. Although critics <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> lacked a classic single and considered it a minor letdown compared to Body Talk Pt. 1, it received praise for being solid and club-ready. In Sweden, the album {{reached the top of}} the Sverigetopplistan chart. It also reached number one in Denmark and number three in Norway. In the United States, it peaked at number forty-one, becoming Robyn's highest position on the chart.|$|E

But it was like, 'OK, what goes on top of it? Where does it go?' I just <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> not what people were looking for from the Stones. I was looking for a sign that they can get real serious about this, still play better than anybody and write better than anybody." ...|$|R

5|$|During the San Diego Comic-Con, it was {{announced}} that a reunion between Zuko and his mother, Ursa, had been arranged and made into a storyboard. However, it was dropped just before the finale was finished, as requested by show co-creator Michael Dante DiMartino, who <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> resolved Ursa's disappearance in an unsatisfactory way and that wasn't the way the story should be told.|$|E
5|$|Following her {{recovery}} from breast cancer, Minogue released her tenth studio album X in 2007. Slated {{to be released}} as Minogue's comeback album, X went platinum in her native-country Australia after it debuted at {{number one on the}} Australian Albums chart. In the United Kingdom, the album entered and peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart and was eventually certified platinum. Critical reception towards X was generally favourable, but many critics <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> lacked introspection from Minogue's side. Later on, critics argued that the album did not serve as a worthy comeback for Minogue.|$|E
5|$|Gary Steinman of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine {{said that}} the lack of a plotline gave the player no {{incentive}} to keep playing through what he felt was a poor combat system. Both of those criticisms were repeated by Electronic Gaming Monthlys Sam Kennedy in his review. RPGamer's Bilyk felt that the smaller plots, while sometimes simplistic and not focused on the player, were enjoyable experiences. IGN's Smith concluded that while he enjoyed the game, he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not a complete game like Secret of Mana, but instead a collection of fun experiences.|$|E

5|$|In February 2009, Telltale Games {{renamed the}} game from its initial release title of Sam & Max: Season One to Sam & Max Save the World. Telltale's public {{relations}} spokeswoman, Emily Morganti, explained that while Season One was thought to communicate the game's episodic nature to potential consumers, the company <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was nondescript {{in relation to the}} game's story. The message accompanied the announcement of an Xbox Live Arcade version of the game, which had been subject to media speculation since February 2007. Both Windows and Wii versions of the game are to be republished using the new title.|$|E
5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai {{did not feel that}} he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he could not speak English natively. He <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, OPEC {{lost its}} two newest members, {{who had joined}} in the mid-1970s. Ecuador withdrew in December 1992, because it was unwilling to pay the annual US$2million {{membership}} fee and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under the OPEC quota, although it rejoined in October 2007. Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995; it rejoined in July 2016. Iraq has remained a member of OPEC since the organization's founding, but Iraqi production was {{not a part of}} OPEC quota agreements from 1998 to 2016, due to the country's daunting political difficulties.|$|E
