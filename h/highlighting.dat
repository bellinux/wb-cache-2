40|$|This journal suppl. entitled: Special Issue: The 9 th Asia-Pacific Conference on Vision (APCV 2013) Specular <b>highlights</b> {{provide a}} source of {{information}} about the 3 D shape of a shiny object, which can allow accurate 3 D shape discrimination from a monocular image (Norman, Todd & Orban, 2004). However, <b>highlights</b> pose a challenge for analysis of stereo shape information because they have binocular disparity relative to the surface of an object. If <b>highlights</b> were misinterpreted as matte shading or surface texture, <b>highlight</b> disparities would indicate the wrong 3 D shape. In this study, we tested whether <b>highlights</b> provide a similar benefit under binocular and monocular viewing conditions, and whether the effect of <b>highlights</b> is modulated by the presence of surface texture, which might help to identify <b>highlights.</b> Observers performed sequential 3 D shape discrimination of random, smoothly-curved symmetric objects. To prevent a 2 D strategy, comparison objects were rotated in depth by 10 ° and rendered with a different light source direction. Objects were presented monocularly or binocularly, and rendered with either: diffuse shading only, shading and <b>highlights,</b> shading and texture, or shading with texture and <b>highlights.</b> We found that <b>highlights</b> provided a similar benefit in both monocular and binocular conditions, and this benefit not modulated by the presence of surface texture. Stereo provided a similar benefit with and without <b>highlights.</b> There was no evidence that stereo viewing interfered with use of <b>highlights,</b> even when surface texture was absent, and the presence of <b>highlights</b> did not interfere with use of stereo information. Despite the geometric challenge posed by stereo <b>highlights,</b> the visual system appears {{to be able to make}} effective use of both sources of information. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
