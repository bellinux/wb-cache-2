However, {{he seems to have}} led a relatively normal life until September 1828, when new symptoms such as effusions of blood appeared. At this stage he moved from the Vienna home of his friend Franz von Schober to his brother Ferdinand's house in the suburbs, following the advice of his doctor; unfortunately, this may have actually worsened his condition. However, up until the last weeks of his life in November 1828, he continued to compose an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> music, including such masterpieces as the three last sonatas.|$|E

On 25 November 1936, a fire spread from the adjacent cannery, destroying the lab. Ricketts lost nearly everything, including an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> correspondence, research notes, manuscripts, and his prized library, which had held everything from invaluable scientific resources to his beloved collection of poetry. However, the manuscript of Ricketts' textbook (with Jack Calvin) Between Pacific Tides had already been sent to the publisher. John Steinbeck would become a silent 50% partner in the lab, after funding its reconstruction costs.|$|E
25|$|One {{means of}} {{studying}} reionization uses the spectra of distant quasars. Quasars release an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> energy, meaning {{they are among}} the brightest objects in the universe. As a result, some quasars are detectable from {{as far back as the}} epoch of reionization. Quasars also happen to have relatively uniform spectral features, regardless of their position in the sky or distance from the Earth. Thus it can be inferred that any major differences between quasar spectra will be caused by the interaction of their emission with atoms along the line of sight. For wavelengths of light at the energies of one of the Lyman transitions of hydrogen, the scattering cross-section is large, meaning that even for low levels of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM), absorption at those wavelengths is highly likely.|$|E

25|$|The event {{affected}} {{a number}} of health care facilities in Sylmar, San Fernando, and other densely populated areas north of central Los Angeles. The Olive View Medical Center and Veterans Hospital both experienced very heavy damage, and buildings collapsed at both sites, causing the majority of deaths that occurred. The buildings at both facilities were constructed with mixed styles, but engineers were unable to thoroughly study the buildings' responses {{because they were not}} outfitted with instruments for recording strong ground motion, and this prompted the Veterans Administration to install seismometers at its high-risk sites. Other sites throughout the Los Angeles area had been instrumented as a result of local ordinances, and an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> strong motion data was recorded, more so than any other event up until that time. The success in this area spurred the initiation of California's Strong Motion Instrumentation Program.|$|E

According to The Wall Street Journal, his [...] "ability to combine box-office success with artistic ambition has given him an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> clout in the industry." [...] Geoff Andrew of the British Film Institute (BFI) and regular contributor to the Sight & Sound magazine, called Nolan [...] "a persuasively inventive storyteller", singling him out as one of few contemporary filmmakers producing highly personal films within the Hollywood mainstream. He also pointed out that Nolan's films are as notable for their [...] "considerable technical virtuosity and visual flair" [...] as for their [...] "brilliant narrative ingenuity and their unusually adult interest in complex philosophical questions." [...] Film scholar David Bordwell compared Nolan to Stanley Kubrick, citing his ability to turn genre movies into both art and event films. Scott Foundas of Variety declared him [...] "the premier big-canvas storyteller of his generation." ...|$|E
500|$|Jay Carr of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "Boys Don't Cry {{not only}} revisits the crime, but convinces us we're being taken inside it". Stephanie Zacharek of Salon gave a {{positive}} review, singling out the directing and acting. She wrote, [...] "Peirce ... covers an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> territory, {{not just in}} terms of dealing with Brandon’s sexual-identity and self-fulfillment issues, but also in trying to understand the lives of those around him". Zacharek described Swank's performance as [...] "a continual revelation" [...] and Sevigny's performance as [...] "transformative". She said, [...] "When Brandon dies, [...] "Boys Don’t Cry" [...] reaches an emotional intensity that’s almost operatic. The saddest thing, though, is seeing Sevigny’s Lana crumpled over his corpse—the way she plays it, you know that when Brandon went, he took a part of her with him, too". David Edelstein of Slate was also very positive towards the film, calling it [...] "a meditation on the irrelevance of gender." [...] He went on to praise Swank, Sevigny, and Sarsgaard in their roles, especially Sevigny, writing that she [...] "keeps the movie tantalizing".|$|E
500|$|No {{artist was}} ever more true to his aim. Ideals resolutely pursued {{are apt to}} provoke the resentment of the world, and Burne-Jones encountered, endured and conquered an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> angry criticism. Insofar as this was {{directed}} against the lack of realism in his pictures, it was beside the point. The earth, the sky, the rocks, the trees, {{the men and women}} of Burne-Jones are not those of this world; but they are themselves a world, consistent with itself, and having therefore its own reality. Charged with the beauty and with the strangeness of dreams, it has nothing of a dream's incoherence. Yet it is a dreamer always whose nature penetrates these works, a nature out of sympathy with struggle and strenuous action. Burne-Jones's men and women are dreamers too. It was this which, more than anything else, estranged him from the age into which he was born. But he had an inbred [...] "revolt from fact" [...] which would have estranged him from the actualities of any age. That criticism seems to be more justified which has found in him a lack of such victorious energy and mastery over his materials as would have enabled him to carry out his conceptions in their original intensity. Yet Burne-Jones was singularly strenuous in production. His industry was inexhaustible, and needed to be, if it was to keep pace with the constant pressure of his ideas. Whatever faults his paintings may have, they have always the fundamental virtue of design; they are always pictures. His designs were informed with a mind of romantic temper, apt in the discovery of beautiful subjects, and impassioned with a delight in pure and variegated colour.|$|E

2500|$|Anna Coe died in 1941, {{but as she}} was ailing, Ernest Coe {{continued}} to write to politicians running for governor, as did Miami Herald editor John Pennekamp, urging them not to forget the directive of the park, particularly {{in the face of}} continuing poaching and destruction of the natural resources of the area. Originally, Coe envisioned [...] of protected land, spanning from Lake Okeechobee to the Florida Keys, including marine coral reefs, and the Big Cypress Swamp. [...] This was an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> land to consider, and the prevailing belief was that only spectacular landforms warranted protection. Many of the park's detractors saw the Everglades as flat and filled with loathsome reptiles. Even the park's supporters had difficulty justifying the inclusion of Coe's vision. May Mann Jennings, who worked to establish Royal Palm State Park and expanded it considerably during the Depression with projects sponsored by the Civilian Conservation Corps, thought Coe's insistence on the amount of land was absurd and began to consider Coe a political liability to the park's establishment.|$|E
