5|$|The {{character}} {{has also made}} several parodic cameo and homage appearances in non-Disney media. In the 1945 radio program This Is My Best, the Queen uttered a curse so dreadful that the Magic Mirror shattered into a thousand pieces and where the Queen once stood {{was nothing but a}} heap of ashes from which black spiders crawled and scuffled off into the night. In Woody Allen's live-action film Annie Hall (1977), Alvy mentions that when he saw Disney's Snow White, he was attracted to the Queen while all the other children had a crush on Snow White. This is followed by an animated sequence of the Wicked Queen, resembling Annie and voiced by <b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton,</b> talking to the cartoon version of the daydreaming Alvy, but turns out that even the Queen scolds him; Alvy attributes it to her having her period mood, to which the Queen reminds him she is just a cartoon character.|$|E

25|$|In a 2004 episode, TC watched an NBC ad for Days of Our Lives on his TV, {{and went}} on to praise the writers of Days of our Lives for coming up with such good storylines; Days, at that time, was under the helm of James E.

In the September 4, 2006, episode, Fox was sucked into a black hole; he then told Tabitha that {{it was the kind of}} black hole that one gets sucked into on the Sci Fi Channel, which was the channel on which Passions repeats aired in 2006.

25|$|Her former friends aren't {{doing much}} better: Annie (<b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton),</b> meanwhile, is separated, {{suffering}} extreme self-esteem issues, {{and going through}} therapy with her husband. Brenda (Bette Midler) is divorced, left for a younger woman, depressed, and struggling financially. Elise (Goldie Hawn), whose husband also left her for a younger woman, is now an aging alcoholic movie actress who has become a plastic-surgery addict to keep her career afloat. Shortly after Cynthia's funeral, at which the three remaining friends are reunited {{for the first time}} since college, Annie's husband, Aaron (Stephen Collins), leaves her for her younger therapist (Marcia Gay Harden) and asks her for a divorce after spending a night together (and leading Annie to believe it would reconcile them); Brenda has a rather unpleasant encounter at a clothing store with her ex, Morty (Dan Hedaya) and his younger and rather hateful mistress Shelly (Sarah Jessica Parker), and Elise finds out that her soon-to be ex-husband, Bill (Victor Garber), is requesting alimony and half of their marital assets claiming that Elise owes her fame to him. Also, during a meeting with a director for a possible leading lady movie role, she discovers that she is only to play the lead female's mother; she later learns the lead female is Bill's current girlfriend. Shortly thereafter, the three friends receive the letters that Cynthia mailed to them before her suicide. After each one reads her letter from Cynthia, and feeling that they have been taken for granted by their husbands, the women decide to create the First Wives Club, aiming to get revenge on their exes. Annie's lesbian daughter Chris (Jennifer Dundas) also gets in on the plan by asking for a job at her father's advertising agency so she can supply her mother with inside information, as payback for Aaron's unfairness toward Annie.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the film}} {{received}} critical acclaim and several awards, Allen himself was disappointed with it, {{and said in}} an interview, [...] "When Annie Hall started out, that film {{was not supposed to}} be what I wound up with. The film was supposed to be what happens in a guy's mind... Nobody understood anything that went on. The relationship between myself and <b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton</b> was all anyone cared about. That was not what I cared about... In the end, I had to reduce the film to just me and <b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton,</b> and that relationship, so I was quite disappointed in that movie". Allen has repeatedly declined to make a sequel, and in a 1992 interview stated that [...] "Sequelism has become an annoying thing. [...] I don't think Francis Coppola should have done Godfather III because Godfather II was quite great. [...] When they make a sequel, it's just a thirst for more money, so I don't like that idea so much".|$|E
500|$|Annie Hall is a 1977 American {{romantic comedy}} film {{directed}} by Woody Allen from a screenplay he co-wrote with Marshall Brickman. Produced by Allen's manager, Charles H.

[...] He and his wife Weisz starred in a Broadway play titled Betrayal. It began performances in October 2013, and continued until January 2014.

500|$|Streep {{played the}} estranged sister of Bessie (<b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton),</b> a woman battling leukemia, in Marvin's Room (1996), an {{adaptation}} of the play by Scott McPherson. Streep recommended Keaton for the role. The film also featured Leonardo DiCaprio as the rebellious son of Streep's character. Roger Ebert stated that [...] "Streep and Keaton, in their different styles, find ways to make Lee and Bessie into {{much more than the}} expression of their problems." [...] The film was well received, and Streep earned another Golden Globe nomination for her performance.|$|E
500|$|Stone {{moved from}} Los Angeles to Greenwich Village, New York City, in 2009. In 2016, she {{moved back to}} Los Angeles. Despite {{frequent}} media coverage, the actress has refused to speak about her private life. Concerned with living a [...] "normal" [...] life, she has said that she finds little value in media attention. She has expressed her fondness for her profession, and has cited actress <b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton</b> as an influence, who is (in Stone's words) [...] "one of the most covered-up actresses of all time". She has also named actress and singer-songwriter Marion Cotillard {{as one of her}} inspirations.|$|E
500|$|Very little {{background}} music is {{heard in the}} film, a departure for Allen influenced by Ingmar Bergman. <b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton</b> performs twice in the jazz club: [...] "It Had to be You" [...] and [...] "Seems Like Old Times" [...] (the latter reprises in voiceover on the closing scene). The other exceptions include a boy's choir [...] "Christmas Medley" [...] played while the characters drive through Los Angeles, the Molto allegro from Mozart's Jupiter Symphony (heard as Annie and Alvy drive through the countryside), Tommy Dorsey's performance of [...] "Sleepy Lagoon", and the anodyne cover of the Savoy Brown song [...] "A Hard Way to Go" [...] playing {{at a party in}} the mansion of Paul Simon's character.|$|E
500|$|Brickman and Allen {{sent the}} {{screenplay}} {{back and forth}} until {{they were ready to}} ask United Artists for $4 million. Many elements from the early drafts did not survive. It was originally a drama centered on a murder mystery with a comic and romantic subplot. [...] According to Allen, the murder occurred after a scene that remains in the film, the sequence in which Annie and Alvy miss the Ingmar Bergman film Face to Face. Although they decided to drop the murder plot, Allen and Brickman made a murder mystery many years later: 1993's Manhattan Murder Mystery, also starring <b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton.</b> The draft that Allen presented to the film's editor, Ralph Rosenblum, concluded with the words, [...] "ending to be shot." ...|$|E
500|$|Gotham City's {{assistant}} district attorney and Bruce's childhood friend, {{who is one of}} the few people who knows Batman's true identity. Gyllenhaal took over the role from Katie Holmes, who played the part in Batman Begins. In August 2005, Holmes was reportedly planning to reprise the role, but she eventually turned it down to film Mad Money with <b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton</b> and Queen Latifah. By March 2007, Gyllenhaal was in [...] "final talks" [...] for the part. Gyllenhaal has acknowledged her character is a damsel in distress to an extent, but says Nolan sought ways to empower her character, so [...] "Rachel's really clear about what's important to her and unwilling to compromise her morals, which made a nice change" [...] from the many conflicted characters whom she has previously portrayed.|$|E
500|$|Karina Longworth notes how [...] "external" [...] Streep's {{performances}} are, [...] "chameleonic" [...] in her impersonation of characters, [...] "subsuming {{herself into}} them, rather than personifying them". In her early roles such as Manhattan and Kramer vs. Kramer, she {{was compared to}} both <b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton</b> and Jill Clayburgh, in that her characters were unsympathetic, which Streep has attributed to the tendency to be drawn to playing women who are difficult to like and lack empathy. Streep has stated that many consider {{her to be a}} technical actor, but she professed that it comes down to her love of reading the initial script, adding, [...] "I come ready and I don't want to screw around and waste the first 10 takes on adjusting lighting and everybody else getting comfortable".|$|E
500|$|Susan Sarandon was {{originally}} set to play Barbara Land before Annette Bening was cast. Bening modeled the character after Ann-Margret's performance in Viva Las Vegas (1964). Hugh Grant {{was the first}} choice for Professor Donald Kessler, which eventually went to Pierce Brosnan. Meryl Streep, <b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton</b> and Stockard Channing were considered for First Lady Marsha Dale, but Glenn Close won the role. In addition to Nicholson, other actors who reunited with Burton on Mars Attacks! include Sylvia Sidney from Beetlejuice (1988), O-Lan Jones from Edward Scissorhands (1990), and Danny DeVito from Batman Returns (1992), continuing Burton's trend of recasting actors several times from his previous works. [...] Tim Burton offered the role of reporter Jason Stone to Johnny Depp, but he rejected the offer cold. [...] The role was given to Michael J. Fox instead.|$|E
500|$|In late 2005, McAdams starred with Sarah Jessica Parker and <b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton</b> in the {{seasonal}} family comedy-drama The Family Stone, which gave McAdams {{an opportunity to}} play a dishevelled and sardonic sister, rather than the usual [...] "obvious" [...] girlfriend or wife roles. She was eager to work with Keaton and remarked, [...] "It's never about line counts for me. It's about the people I get to work with." [...] Justin Chang of Variety noted that [...] "a deglammed but still radiant McAdams proves once again that she's the real deal, delivering a deliciously feisty performance". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt that her [...] "engaging screen presence holds your attention and sympathy despite the handicap presented by her character's personality." [...] The film was a commercial success: it cost $18 million to make and grossed over $92 million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Strickland {{appeared}} in two romantic comedy films in 2003. Anything Else, {{written and directed}} by Woody Allen, featured her as the girlfriend of Jason Biggs's character (whom he snubs for Christina Ricci's Amanda Chase); she said it was a [...] "dream come true" [...] to work with Allen, of whom she is an [...] "obsessive diehard" [...] fan. The film was greeted with lukewarm reviews and dismal ticket sales, though Strickland later referred to it as her [...] "big break". The second, Something's Gotta Give (starring Jack Nicholson and <b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton),</b> was a major critical and commercial success, though Strickland's part in the film was brief. She played the girlfriend of Keaton's character's ex-husband (played by Paul Michael Glaser), a relationship involving age disparity that raised the eyebrows of Keaton and her daughter (Amanda Peet). The following year, she made brief appearances in the direct-to-cable independent film Knots and the poorly received satirical comedy The Stepford Wives with Nicole Kidman, ...|$|E
500|$|Hair {{opened on}} Broadway at the Biltmore Theatre on April 29, 1968. [...] The {{production}} {{was directed by}} Tom O'Horgan and choreographed by Julie Arenal, with set design by Robin Wagner, costume design by Nancy Potts, and lighting design by Jules Fisher. [...] The original Broadway [...] "tribe" [...] (i.e., cast) included authors Rado and Ragni, who played the lead roles of Claude and Berger, respectively, and Lynn Kellogg as Sheila, Lamont Washington as Hud, Sally Eaton and Shelley Plimpton reprising their off-Broadway roles as Jeanie and Crissy, Melba Moore as Dionne, Steve Curry as Woof, Ronnie Dyson (who sang [...] "Aquarius"), Paul Jabara and <b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton</b> (both Moore and Keaton later played Sheila). [...] Among the performers who appeared in Hair during its original Broadway run were Ben Vereen, Keith Carradine, Barry McGuire, Ted Lange, Meat Loaf, La La Brooks, Kenny Seymour (of Little Anthony and The Imperials), Joe Butler, Peppy Castro (of the Blues Magoos), Robin McNamara, Heather MacRae (daughter of Gordon MacRae and Sheila MacRae), Eddie Rambeau, Vicki Sue Robinson, Beverly Bremers, Dale Soules and Kim Milford.|$|E
500|$|After {{more than}} a quarter century, the film has {{continued}} to receive positive reviews. In his 2002 lookback, Roger Ebert noted with surprise that the film had [...] "an instant familiarity" [...] despite its age, and Slant writer Jaime N. Christley found the one-liners [...] "still gut-busting after 35 years". A later Guardian critic, Peter Bradshaw, named it the best comedy film of all time, commenting that [...] "this wonderfully funny, unbearably sad film is a miracle of comic writing and inspired film-making". John Marriott of the Radio Times believed that Annie Hall was the film where Allen [...] "found his own singular voice, a voice that echoes across events with a mixture of exuberance and introspection", referring to the [...] "comic delight" [...] derived from the [...] "spirited playing of <b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton</b> as the kooky innocent from the Midwest, and Woody himself as the fumbling New York neurotic". Empire magazine rated the movie five out of five stars, calling it a [...] "classic". At Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 65 reviews, with an average rating of 8.9 out of 10. The site's consensus reads [...] "Filled with poignant performances and devastating humor, Annie Hall represents a quantum leap for Woody Allen and remains an American classic".|$|E
500|$|<b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton</b> {{has stated}} that Annie Hall was her {{favorite}} role and that the film meant everything to her. When asked if being most associated with the role concerned her as an actress, she replied, [...] "I'm not haunted by Annie Hall. I'm happy to be Annie Hall. If somebody wants to see me that way, it's fine by me". Costume designer Ruth Morley, working with Keaton, created a look which had an influence on the fashion world during the late-70s, with women adopting the style: layering oversized, mannish blazers over vests, billowy trousers or long skirts, a man's tie, and boots. The look was {{often referred to as}} the [...] "Annie Hall look". Some sources suggest that Keaton herself was mainly responsible for the look, and Ralph Lauren has often claimed credit, but only one jacket and one tie were purchased from Ralph Lauren for use in the film. Allen recalled that Lauren and Keaton's dress style almost did not end up in the film. [...] "She came in," [...] he recalled in 1992, [...] "and the costume lady on Annie Hall said, 'Tell her not to wear that. She can't wear that. [...] It's so crazy.' And I said, 'Leave her. She's a genius. Let's just leave her alone, let her wear what she wants.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Willis {{described}} the production {{for the film}} as [...] "relatively easy." [...] He shot in varying styles; [...] "hot golden light for California, grey overcast for Manhattan and a forties Hollywood glossy for... dream sequences," [...] {{most of which were}} cut. It was his suggestion which led Allen to film the dual therapy scenes in one set divided by a wall instead of the usual split screen method. He tried long takes, with some shots, unabridged, lasting an entire scene, which, for Ebert, add to the dramatic power of the film: [...] "Few viewers probably notice how much of Annie Hall consists of people talking, simply talking. They walk and talk, sit and talk, go to shrinks, go to lunch, make love and talk, talk to the camera, or launch into inspired monologues like Annie's free-association as she describes her family to Alvy. This speech by <b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton</b> is as close to perfect as such a speech can likely be... all done in one take of brilliant brinksmanship." [...] He cites a study that calculated the average shot length of Annie Hall to be 14.5 seconds, while other films made in 1977 had an average shot length of 4–7 seconds. Peter Cowie suggests that [...] "Allen breaks up his extended shots with more orthodox cutting back and forth in conversation pieces, so that the forward momentum of the film is sustained." [...] Bernd Herzogenrath notes the innovation {{in the use of the}} split screen during the dinner scene to powerfully exaggerate the contrast between the Jewish and the gentile family.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, McAdams starred {{with her}} The Family Stone co-star <b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton</b> and Harrison Ford in the comedy Morning Glory. She played a {{television}} producer attempting {{to improve the}} poor ratings of a morning television program. The film was billed as a starring vehicle for McAdams. She initially felt she was unsuited to the role saying, [...] "I'm not funny. So I said, 'if you need me to be funny, {{you might want to}} look somewhere else'". The film's director Roger Michell had a number of dinners with McAdams and persuaded her to join the cast. Since working with Keaton, McAdams has described her as a mentor figure. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said McAdams [...] "gives the kind of performance we go to the movies for" [...] while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt she played [...] "as lovable a lead as anyone since Amy Adams in Junebug" [...] in an otherwise [...] "routine" [...] movie. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post was impressed by [...] "her gift for physical comedy", as was Varietys Andrew Barker. While Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt she [...] "plays her role exceptionally well" [...] and is [...] "effortlessly likable", it called on Hollywood to give her parts [...] "worthy" [...] of her talent. [...] "Ms.McAdams has to rely on her dimples to get by. She does, but she could do better." [...] The film was a modest commercial success, grossing $58million worldwide from a production budget of $40million. McAdams later expressed her disappointment that the film failed to find a larger audience.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, McAdams {{starred in}} Woody Allen's fantasy romantic comedy Midnight in Paris with her Wedding Crashers co-star Owen Wilson and Michael Sheen. The film opened the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. McAdams played Inez, the shrewish fiancée of Wilson's {{character}} Gil. Allen wrote McAdams' part for her, after hearing [...] "glowing reports" [...] from {{his friend and}} her former co-star <b>Diane</b> <b>Keaton.</b> He {{said that he was}} [...] "crazy about Rachel" [...] and wanted to give her the opportunity to play something other than [...] "beautiful girls". The film was shot on location in Paris and McAdams has said that the experience [...] "will always have a great place in my heart". Hadley Freeman The Guardian criticized that she [...] "has morphed from the sweet thing in Wedding Crashers to the dream-crushing bitch that, according to American comedies, women become once they ensnare their man". Richard Corliss of Time [...] "felt sorry for McAdams, whose usually winning presence is ground into hostile cliché". However, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt she [...] "deftly handles a part that is less amiable than usual for her" [...] and A. O. Scott of The New York Times found her [...] "superbly speeded-up". It became Allen's highest-grossing film ever in North America and was the most commercially successful independent film of 2011. With a production budget of $17million, the film has grossed over $151 million worldwide. McAdams, along with six other members of the cast, received a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture nomination. Allen won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and the film itself was nominated for three other Academy Awards, including Best Picture.|$|E
