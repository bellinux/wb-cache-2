50|$|As of 2016, <b>dimethylpolysiloxane</b> and TBHQ {{are listed}} as {{ingredients}} in the McNuggets cooking process. According to Lisa McComb, a media relations representative for McDonald's, <b>dimethylpolysiloxane</b> {{is used as a}} matter of safety to keep the frying oil from foaming. The chemical is a form of silicone also used in cosmetics and Silly Putty. A review of animal studies by the World Health Organization found no adverse health effects associated with <b>dimethylpolysiloxane.</b> TBHQ is a common preservative for vegetable oils, cereals, nuts, cookies, chips and animal fats, found in other foods like Girl Scout Cookies and Quaker Chewy Granola Bars. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration sets an upper limit of 0.02% of the oil or fat content in foods, which like other foods, applies to the oil used in McNuggets. Effective use of TBHQ is 1 gram per 5000 grams of cooking oil (1 gram per 11.023 pounds of cooking oil).|$|E
50|$|In most countries, a {{separate}} definition of VOCs is used {{with regard to}} indoor air quality that comprises each organic chemical compound that can be measured as follows: Adsorption from air on Tenax TA, thermal desorption, gas chromatographic separation over a 100% nonpolar column (<b>dimethylpolysiloxane).</b> VOC (volatile organic compounds) are all compounds that appear in the gas chromatogram between and including n-hexane and n-hexadecane. Compounds appearing earlier are called VVOC (very volatile organic compounds); compounds appearing later are called SVOC (semi-volatile organic compounds).

40|$|The Abraham {{solvation}} parameter {{model is}} a good approach for analyzing and predicting biological activities and partitioning coefficients. The general solvation equation {{has been used to}} predict the solute property (SP) behavior of drug compounds between biological barriers. Gas chromatography (GC) retention time can be used to predict molecular descriptors, such as E, S, A, B & L for existing and newly developed drug compounds. In this research, six columns of different stationary phases were used to predict the Abraham molecular descriptors more accurately. The six stationary phases used were 5 % phenylmethyl polysiloxane, 6 % cyanopropylphenyl 94 % <b>dimethylpolysiloxane,</b> 5 % diphenyl 95 % <b>dimethylpolysiloxane,</b> 100 % <b>dimethylpolysiloxane,</b> polyethylene glycol and 35 % diphenyl 65 % <b>dimethylpolysiloxane.</b> Retention times (RT) of 75 compounds have been measured and logarithm of experimental average retention time Ln(RTexp) are calculated. The Abraham solvation model is then applied to predict the process coefficients of these compounds using the literature values of the molecular descriptors (Acree Compilation descriptors). Six correlation equations are built up as a training set for each of the six columns. The six equations are then used to predict the molecular descriptors of the illegal drugs as a test set. This work shows the ability to extract molecular information from a new compound by utilizing commonly used GC columns available with the desired stationary phases. One can simply run the new compound in GC using these columns to get the retention time. Plugging in the retention time into the developed equations for each of the column will predict the molecular descriptors for the test compound and will give some information about the properties of the compound...|$|E

Identification of compounds was carried out by comparing the mass spectrum collected from the Wiley library and retention times and mass spectra to those obtained from the analyses of authentic standards (PAHs were purchased from Neochema, Bodenheim, Germany; dioctyldiphenylamine was purchased from Chemos GmbH, Regenstauf, Germany). Quantification of PAHs was performed by calculating the peak area ratios of the individual PAHs and selected deuterated PAHs corrected by a factor resulting from different recoveries. The procedural blanks for PAHs were between 0.28 (BAA) and 4.04 μg/kg (PHE). The LOD were either determined by blanks or by a peak-to-noise ratio of 3 : 1. The LOQ were set at three times the LOD.|$|E
40|$|High-Frame-Rate Oil Film Interferometry Jonathan Charles White This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a high-frame-rate oil film interferometry technique (HOFI) used to directly measure skin friction in time dependent flows. Experiments were performed to determine {{the ability of a}} high-speed camera to capture oil film interferometry images. HOFI was found to be able to capture these interferometry images at frequencies up to 105 Hz. Steady laminar and turbulent flows were tested. Transient flows tested consisted of a wind tunnel ramping up in velocity and a laminar boundary layer which was intermittently tripped to turbulence by puffing air out of a pressure tap. Flow speeds ranged from 0 to 108 ft/sec and 10 and 50 cSt Dow Corning 200 <b>dimethylpolysiloxane</b> silicone oil was used. The skin friction was determined from the rate of change of the height of the oil film using lubrication theory. The height of the oil film was determined from the high speed camera interferogram images using a MATLAB script which determined fringe spacing by fitting a four-parameter sine wave to the intensity levels in each image. The MATLAB script was able to determine the height of the oil film for thousands of interferogram images in only a few minutes with sub-pixel error in fringe spacing. The skin friction was calculated using the oil film height history allowing for the direct measurement of skin friction in time dependent flows...|$|E
40|$|The {{approach}} to authenticate Luwak coffee is made through analysis of volatile compounds of luwak coffee. Luwak coffee bean from type of arabica obtained from Andungsari Plantation in Bondowoso district, East Java Province Indonesia, was wet processed and sundried prior to roasting step. As many as 120 g green bean was roasted at 170 - 220 °C for 8 - 12 minutes until reached light brown colour (Agtron scale 65) and was ground prior to extraction. Volatile compounds of roasted Luwak arabica coffee bean were extracted by using solid phase microextraction (SPME) at 60 °C for 30 minutes. The extracted analyte was subsequently transferred into GC-FID system by splitless injection at 260 °C with five minutes sampling time, continued with separation through 50 % phenyl 50 % <b>dimethylpolysiloxane</b> capillary column and oven temperature programmed from 60 °C to 180 °C with rate of 5 °C/min. Resulted chromatogram shows major peaks mainly in Rt 8. 360 - 9. 981, and Rt 9. 705 - 14. 778, and minor peaks identified before Rt 10 and after Rt 24. Varied sample quantity ranged within 0. 5 - 2. 5 g produced chromatograms {{which were not}} significantly different (p= 0. 08). This research also observed the use of γ-picoline (4 -methylpyridine) as internal standard. It was showed that γ-picoline appeared at Rt 8. 6 ~ without overlaying other peaks originated from sample. Concentration of γ-picoline at 0. 05 μL/g, resulted separable peaks. These findings showed that the use of solid phase microextraction and GC-FID is capable to be apply for identification and quantification of Luwak coffe...|$|E
40|$|A method {{producing}} simultaneously three retention indexes for compounds {{has been}} developed for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography by using a dual secondary column approach (GC × 2 GC). For this purpose, the primary flow of the first dimension column was equally diverted into two secondary microbore columns of identical geometry {{by means of a}} three-way flow splitter positioned after the longitudinally modulated cryogenic system. This configuration produced a pair of comprehensive two-dimensional chromatograms and generated retention data on three different stationary phases in a single run. First dimension retention indexes were determined on a polar SolGel-Wax column under linear programmed-temperature conditions according to the van den Dool approach using primary alcohol homologues as the reference scale. Calculation of pseudoisothermal retention indexes in both second dimensions was performed on low-polarity 5 % phenyl equivalent polysilphenylene/siloxane (BPX 5) and 14 % cyanopropylphenyl/ 86 % <b>dimethylpolysiloxane</b> (BP 10) columns. To construct a retention correlation map in the second dimension separation space upon which Kováts indexes can be derived, two methods exploiting "isovolatility" relationships of alkanes were developed. The first involved 15 sequential headspace samplings of selected n-alkanes by solid-phase microextraction (SPME), with each sampling followed by their injection into the GC at predetermined times during the chromatographic run. The second method extended the second dimension retention map and consisted of repetitive introduction of SPME-sampled alkane mixtures at various isothermal conditions incremented over the temperature program range. Calculated second dimension retention indexes were compared with experimental values obtained in conventional one-dimensional GC. A case study mixture including 24 suspected allergens (i. e., fragrance ingredients) was used to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of retention index information in comprehensive 2 D-GC...|$|E
