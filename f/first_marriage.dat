50|$|There {{are several}} reasons why second marriages can be more {{vulnerable}} to disruption. Partners bring the same personal qualities to their subsequent marriage as they had during the first, but some of these qualities {{may have contributed to}} the <b>first</b> <b>marriage’s</b> problems. People who have divorced and remarried multiple times tend to be relatively impulsive and nonconformist. In second marriages, partners also often have to deal with additional complications that do not exist in <b>first</b> <b>marriages,</b> like combining families. Remarriages involving stepchildren have a greater rate of dissolution than those without.|$|R

40|$|In <b>first</b> <b>marriages</b> in the United States grooms are {{on average}} 1. 7 {{years older than}} their brides, the {{life-cycle}} profile of this age gap is increasing both for the grooms and for the brides, and it is steeper for the grooms. To address these issues we construct a general equilibrium model economy in which people search for spouses, and they marry because they value bearing children, sharing their income with their spouses, and companionship. A distinguishing feature of our model economy is that the age distributions of singles are endogenous. We calibrate our model economy so that it replicates some of the aggregate features of the timing of <b>first</b> <b>marriages</b> in the United States. And we find that gender differences in fecundity are essential {{to account for the}} average age gap observed in <b>first</b> <b>marriages.</b> We also find that distributions of single people that are decreasing in age and some random matching are sufficient to account for the positive slopes of the life-cycle profiles of the age gaps at first marriage; and that gender differences in fecundity account for these profiles being steeper for the grooms...|$|R
40|$|Objectives—This report {{presents}} national {{estimates of}} the duration of <b>first</b> and second <b>marriages</b> for women 15 – 44 years of age in 1995. National {{estimates of the}} probability of divorce given separation and of the probability of remarriage given divorce are also presented. Methods—The life- table estimates {{are based on a}} nationally representative sample of women 15 – 44 years of age in the United States in 1995 from the National Survey of Family Growth, Cycle 5. Results—One fifth of <b>first</b> <b>marriages</b> end within 5 years and one third end within 10 years. <b>First</b> <b>marriages</b> of teenagers disrupt faster than the <b>first</b> <b>marriages</b> of women who were ages 20 years and older at <b>marriage.</b> <b>First</b> <b>marriages</b> of black non-Hispanic women dissolve at a faster rate: 47 percent end within 10 years compared with 34 percent for Hispanic, 32 percent for white non-Hispanic, and 20 percent for Asian non-Hispanic women. Virtually all separations among white non-Hispanic women (98 percent) end in divorce within 6 years, compared with only 80 percent of separations among Hispanic women and 72 percent of separations among black non-Hispanic women. Women under age 25 years at divorce are more likely to remarry than women at least age 25 years at divorce. White non-Hispanic and Hispanic women {{are much more likely to}} remarry than black non-Hispanic women. White non-Hispanic women are slightly more likely than Hispanic women to remarry. The data suggest that women who remarry before age 25 years are more likely to experience a second marital disruption than women who remarry at ages older than 25 years, although the difference is only significant at late marital durations. Black non-Hispanic remarriages are more likely to disrupt than Hispanic or white non-Hispanic remarriages...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} the effect of {{children}} on divorce risks in <b>first</b> and subsequent <b>marriages</b> in Sweden and compare risk patterns in the two types of marriages based on register data. We examine the impact of parity and the age of the youngest child while standardizing for age at marriage, premarital childbearing, calendar year, and marital duration. We apply our models to Swedish register data and also compute a number of interactions between marital order and our other demographic variables. We find independent effects of parity and the age of the youngest child on the disruption risk in both a first and a later marriage. In general, the patterns of divorce risks for women in later marriages are quite similar to the patterns in <b>first</b> <b>marriages,</b> but the effect of the number of children is weaker in subsequent marriages. Consistent with other studies, the level of disruption risk is higher in later <b>marriages</b> than in <b>first</b> <b>marriages.</b> ...|$|R
