60|$|The mists had congregated {{about the}} distant mountain-side, {{and there were}} seen the grand and awful {{features}} of the Great Stone Face, awful but benignant, as if a mighty angel were sitting among the hills, and <b>enrobing</b> himself in a cloud-vesture of gold and purple. As he looked, Ernest could hardly believe but that a smile beamed over the whole visage, with a radiance still brightening, although without motion of the lips. It was probably {{the effect of the}} western sunshine, melting through the thinly diffused vapors that had swept between him and the object that he gazed at. But--as it always did--the aspect of his marvellous friend made Ernest as hopeful as if he had never hoped in vain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Enrobing</b> — a {{chocolate}} coating process.|$|E
50|$|An enrober is {{a machine}} {{used in the}} {{confectionery}} industry to coat a food item with a coating medium, typically chocolate. Foods that are coated by enrobers include nuts, ice cream, toffee, biscuits and cookies. <b>Enrobing</b> is essentially a mechanized alternative to hand-dipping. <b>Enrobing</b> with chocolate extends a confection's shelf life.|$|E

50|$|In 1967 the {{business}} was moved to a purpose built factory in Moorside Road, Winchester. During the 1960s it had been acquired by Wood Hall Trust Ltd. (itself subsequently being acquired by Elders IXL, the Australian conglomerate, in 1982). In later years <b>enrobing</b> equipment was introduced allowing an increase in production.|$|E
50|$|In 1991 {{the company}} {{expanded}} into chocolate production, under the brand Ritzbury, importing a chocolate machine for individual chocolates and an <b>enrobing</b> plant to make chocolate coated biscuits and wafers.

50|$|Around {{the same}} time as the Cupid Candies deal, the Frango Viewing Kitchen on the seventh floor of Chicago's Macy's On State Street, which had closed in 1999 when Frango {{production}} was moved to Pennsylvania, was reopened. The kitchen allows store guests to see the <b>enrobing</b> process where Frango chocolate centers are covered in chocolate to create the outside layer. These enrobed chocolates are later used for sampling.|$|E
50|$|Most recently, Gronemeyer and MacLeod have {{scrutinized}} Monument 6 {{again and}} offer a new interpretation of the passage dealing with the 13-Bak'tun ending. According to them, the inscription announces the witnessing of the deity Bolon Yokte' K'uh who will be publicly displayed by the occasion of his investiture. By applying several linguistic and ethnographic parallels, this may happen by the <b>enrobing</b> and/or parading of an effigy of the said deity.|$|E

50|$|The {{process begins}} using giant blocks of Chicago's own Blommer chocolate, melted at nearly 200 °F. Tiny {{rectangular}} molds receive {{the combination of}} milk and dark chocolate, plus a special mint oil, after the mixture is tempered to 83 °F. Air bubbles are eliminated by shaking the molds. The product is cooled via a trip through a long, refrigerated tunnel. The chocolates are then sent through an <b>enrobing</b> machine, where more chocolate is poured over them. The Frango mints are cooled once again, then boxed by hand, sealed, wrapped and packaged for shipment.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} <b>enrobing</b> {{involves}} placing {{the items on}} the enrober's feed band, which may consist of a wire mesh or containers in which the confection to be enrobed are placed, with each container having drain holes to recover excess chocolate. The enrober maintains the coating medium at a controlled constant temperature and pumps the medium into a flow pan. The medium flows from the flow pan in a continuous curtain and bottoming bed that the food items pass through, completely coating them. A wire mesh conveyor belt then transports the coated confection to a cooling area.|$|E

40|$|The ice-cream cone is {{only one}} example of the many types of {{wafer-based}} foods. The many others have a diversity of shapes and enhancements with cream fillings and chocolate <b>enrobing.</b> They are low-fat cereal products, basically made from flour and water to give a very thin biscuit (1 – 5 mm thick) in a rigid shape.

40|$|<b>Enrobing</b> is {{a process}} that {{involves}} covering a confection or snack with chocolate or chocolate coatings. Traditionally, this process was slow and involved manually dipping the pieces into melted chocolate by hand. As demand for chocolate-coated sweets increased, it became impractical or impossible to employ enough people to dip sweets into melted chocolate to keep up with production demand. <b>Enrobing</b> can be carried out with chocolate or compound coatings (compound coating is a replacement product made from a combination of cocoa, vegetable fat, and sweeteners). An advantage of compound coatings is that they may set faster and no tempering (the process in which chocolate masses are thermally treated to produce a small fraction of homogeneously dispersed, highly stable fat crystals of the correct type and size) is needed 1. Some typical examples of enrobed products are shown in Figure 1 (page 37). They include wafer bars, fondant centres, jellies, nuts, biscuits and ice cream...|$|E
40|$|Chocolate is {{a complex}} soft solid that {{undergoes}} a series of physical transformations in the mouth during consumption. Normally chocolate products are manufactured by liquid processing techniques that include ‘melting and casting ’ liquid chocolate into moulds as well as <b>enrobing</b> sweet centres with a chocolate outer shell. There is however another method of shape forming chocolate and this review discusses the key elements of a so called ‘cold extrusion ’ process. This process involves a combination of pressure and flow, which results in a product with a temporary flexibility. The review covers the basic aspects of the composition and microstructure of chocolate together with experimental observations on the cold extrusion process and the subsequent post extrusion flexibility of the extrudate. Finally some physical insight into the unusual behaviour of chocolate during and after cold extrusion is presented...|$|E

40|$|Compressed mini-tablets {{systems are}} {{presented}} as a biphasic delivery system designed for zero-order sustained drug release. The outer layer that fills the void spaces between the mini-tablets was formulated to release the drug {{in a very short}} time (fast release), while the mini-tablets provided a prolonged release. Different composition (HPMC or EC) and number (10 or 2 1) of mini-tablets were used to obtain different drug release rates. The in vitro performance of these systems showed the desired biphasic behaviour: the drug contained in the fast releasing phase (powder <b>enrobing</b> the mini-tablets) dissolved within the first 2 min, whereas the drug contained in the mini-tablets was released at different rates, depending up on formulation. Based on the release kinetic parameters calculated, it can be concluded that mini-tablets containing HPMC were particularly suitable approaching to zero-order (constant) release over 8 h time periods.

40|$|International audienceNanobiotechnology {{enables the}} {{emergence}} of entirely new classes of bioactive devices intended for targeted intracellular delivery for more efficacies and less toxicities. Among organic and inorganic approaches currently developed, controlled release from polymer matrices promises utmost clinical impact. Here, a unique nanotechnology strategy is used to entrap, protect, and stabilize therapeutic agents into polymer coatings acting as nanoreservoirs <b>enrobing</b> nanofibers of implantable membranes. Upon contact with cells, therapeutic agents become available through enzymatic degradation of the nanoreservoirs. As cells grow, divide, and infiltrate deeper into the porous membrane, they trigger slow and progressive release of therapeutic agents that, in turn, stimulate further cell proliferation. This constitutes the first instance of a smart living nanostructured hybrid membrane for regenerative medicine. The cell contact-dependent bioerodable nanoreservoirs described here will permit sustained release of drugs, genes, growth factors, etc., opening a general route {{to the design of}} sophisticated celltherapy implants capable of robust and durable regeneration of a broad variety of tissues...|$|E
