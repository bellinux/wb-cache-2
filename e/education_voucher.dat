2500|$|Although Paul {{supports}} {{the right of}} state and local school districts, under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, to implement <b>education</b> <b>voucher</b> plans, he rejects federal government-controlled school voucher plans, preferring federal education tax credits instead. He regards federal voucher programs as a form of [...] "taxpayer-funded welfare" [...] in which money is taken from middle-class families to unfairly provide private-school educations to a particular group of children favored by politicians and bureaucrats. He also worries that with federal school vouchers inevitably come further central government regulation and loss of local control over education. Private, religious schools, for instance, would feel pressured to conform to government dictates in order to become accredited by the Department of Education to qualify for participation in the voucher program. He points to how the federal government has used the threat of cutting off funding to dictate to universities which policies they must accept; he argues that the government would try to do the same with private schools.|$|E

5000|$|... 3. <b>Education</b> <b>Voucher</b> Scheme (EVS):To ensure {{socio-economic}} {{justice and}} to avoid educational apartheid in the society at grassroots, {{the poorest of the}} poor and disenfranchised sections of the society must get equal opportunity and access to quality education enabling the future generations to get out of the vicious circle of poverty and deprivation. There is no doubt that education is a strong mechanism that can be used to develop the human capital resources of the less-privileged in urban and rural slums. In collaboration with Columbia University, USA, the PEF Board of Directors designed <b>Education</b> <b>Voucher</b> Scheme (EVS) for the slums/katchi abadies in the province of Punjab. A pilot project was started in the urban slums of Sukh Nehar, Lahore. Initially, the age cohort for the EVS candidate children was 5-13 years and during the 34th BOD meeting on 20 October 2007 the age cohort was approved as between the ages of 4 and 17.EVS started its Pilot Project in the last quarter of 2006 from the area of Sukh Nehar, Lahore. During the first phase in October 2006, 11 Schools, 527 households and 1053 students were facilitated through this scheme. In a short span of time, 13 expansion phases have been launched while the number of beneficiary students in 36 districts of the Punjab has reached to more than two lakh in 2014. The voucher is redeemable against payment of fee in the private educational institutions. EVS Office has devised standard procedures of its operations. All steps right from the selection of area for launching the scheme to voucher distribution and from selection of partner schools to quality assurance in the partner schools are well defined. The inception of EVS has many positive impacts. These impacts can be seen not only in the schools but in the local areas as well. There has been an increase in enrolment of students, regularity of attendance of students in the schools. Better students’ performance and improvement of salary structure of teachers in partner schools on one hand. On the other hand, reduction in educational gaps between poor and rich, decrease in drop out rate are also visible in the areas where EVS has been launched.|$|E

The aim inherent within the Pre-primary <b>Education</b> <b>Voucher</b> Scheme, to provide affordable and quality pre-primary schooling to all students aged 3 to 6, will benefit parents, students, teachers, and pre-primary services operators. The Pre-primary <b>Education</b> <b>Voucher</b> Scheme provides a fee subsidy for parents to enroll their children in pre-primary institutions and financial support to teachers for professional development. For each child older than two years and eight months attending a local non-profit-making kindergarten or relevant classes in a local non-profit-making kindergartencum-child care centre, a subsidy of $ 10, 000 will be given in the 2007 – 2008 school year.

40|$|In this article, {{we review}} the {{empirical}} {{evidence on the}} impact of <b>education</b> <b>vouchers</b> on student achievement and briefly discuss the evidence from other forms of school choice. The best research to date finds relatively small achievement gains for students offered <b>education</b> <b>vouchers,</b> most of which are not statistically different from zero. Furthermore, what little evidence exists regarding the potential for public schools to respond to increased competitive pressure generated by vouchers suggests that one should remain wary that large improvements would result from a more comprehensive voucher system. The evidence from other forms of school choice is also consistent with this conclusion. Many questions remain unanswered, however, including whether vouchers have longer-run impacts on outcomes such as graduation rates, college enrollment, or even future wages, and whether vouchers might nevertheless provide a costneutral alternative to our current system of public education provision at the elementary and secondary school level. school competition, school efficiency, school choice, academic achievement...|$|R
