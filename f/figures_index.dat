40|$|Tumor {{angiogenesis}} {{is essential}} for tumor growth and metastasis, and intratumoral microvessel density correlates with prognosis in breast carcinoma. Yet, how intratumoral microvessel density correlates with tumor cell and intratumoral endothelial cell proliferation remains incompletely understood. To this end, we stained 57 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast carcinomas with antibody MIB 1 to determine tumor cell Ki 67 labeling index and with anti-CD 34 to observe microvessels. We correlated the tumor cell Ki 67 labeling <b>index</b> and mitotic <b>figure</b> <b>index</b> with intratumoral microvessel density. Using a double labeling technique combining antibody MIB 1 and anti-CD 34, we measured intratumoral endothelial cell proliferation in 20 of these cases and correlated these findings with tumor cell Ki 67 labeling <b>index,</b> mitotic <b>figure</b> <b>index,</b> and intratumoral microvessel density. The intratumoral Ki 67 -labeling index was 45 -fold greater (P < 0. 000001) than that of microvessels in adjacent benign breast. Yet, endothelial cell Ki 67 labeling index did not correlate with intratumoral microvessel density, tumor cell Ki 67 labeling <b>index,</b> or mitotic <b>figure</b> <b>index</b> nor did intratumoral microvessel density correlate with tumor cell Ki 67 labeling <b>index</b> or mitotic <b>figure</b> <b>index.</b> These findings suggest that, although endothelial cells are actively proliferating within the tumor, intratumoral microvessel density and intratumoral endothelial cell proliferation are independent {{of each other and}} of tumor cell proliferation. Thus, intratumoral microvessel density, endothelial cell proliferation, and tumor cell proliferation may be regulated by separate mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|In {{the paper}} {{we present a}} {{description}} of complex systems in terms of self-organization processes of prime integer relations. A prime integer relation is an indivisible element made up of integers as the basic constituents following a single organizing principle. The prime integer relations control correlation structures of complex systems and may describe complex systems in a strong scale covariant form. It is possible to geometrize the prime integer relations as two-dimensional patterns and isomorphically express the self-organization processes through transformations of the geometric patterns. As a result, prime integer relations can be measured by corresponding geometric patterns specifying the dynamics of complex systems. Determined by arithmetic only, the self-organization processes of prime integer relations can describe complex systems by information not requiring further explanations. This gives the possibility to develop an irreducible theory of complex systems. Comment: 8 pages, 4 <b>figures,</b> <b>index</b> corrected, minor changes mainly of stylistic characte...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We present, extend {{and apply}} {{a method to}} extract the {{contribution}} of a subregion of a data set to the global flow. To isolate this contribution we decompose the flow in the subregion into a potential flow that is induced by the original flow on the boundary and a localized flow. The localized flow is obtained by subtracting the potential flow from the original flow. Since the potential flow is free of both divergence and rotation the localized flow retains the original features and captures the region-specific flow that contains the local contribution of the considered subdomain to the global flow. In {{the remainder of the}} paper, we describe an implementation on unstructured grids in both two and three dimensions for steady and unsteady flow fields. We discuss the application of some widely used feature extraction methods on the localized flow and describe applications like reverse-flow detection using the potential flow. Finally, we show that our algorithm is robust and scalable by applying it to various flow data sets and giving performance <b>figures.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms — Flow visualization, Neumann problem, Local contribution, Potential flow...|$|E

40|$|When {{there are}} {{a large number of}} antennas in massive MIMO systems, the {{transmitted}} wideband signal will be sensitive to the physical propagation delay of electromagnetic waves across the large array aperture, which is called the spatial-wideband effect or the spatial selectivity. In this scenario, transceiver design in wideband massive MIMO is different from most of the existing works, which presumes that the bandwidth of the transmitted signals is not that wide, ignores the spatial-wideband effect, and only addresses the frequency selectivity. In this paper, we investigate spatial- and frequency- wideband effects, called dual-wideband effects, in massive MIMO systems from array signal processing point of view. Taking mmWave-band communications as an example, we describe the transmission process to address the dual-wideband effects. By exploiting the channel sparsity in the angle domain and the delay domain, we develop the efficient uplink and downlink channel estimation strategies that require much less amount of training overhead and cause no pilot contamination. Thanks to the array signal processing techniques, the proposed channel estimation is suitable for both TDD and FDD massive MIMO systems. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed transmission design for massive MIMO systems can effectively deal with the dual-wideband effects.

40|$|Abstract — The {{present study}} {{analyzed}} consultants in Saudi Arabia. Engineering consultancy firms {{work on projects}} worth billions of US dollars annually {{in the fields of}} design and supervision. The quality of the services provided in this field has a major impact on the national economy through various aspects of these services, such as the lifetime of the projects, their environmental effects, their efficiency, the esthetics of cities, and the societal impacts of the projects. Thus, the author investigated the knowledge, experience, human resources and financial situations of these firms, and the scientific qualifications of their professional staff. A survey was conducted using several consultancy firms and a database was constructed, while some of these firms were prequalified. The results of this exercise were revised and checked thoroughly, then used to construct a questionnaire to evaluate the firms. This study focused on applying a scientific approach to the classification of engineering consultancy firms using self-organizing maps (SOMs). An electronic version of the questionnaire was made available for all firms to complete to build the required database. A template was created using Microsoft Word to summarize the information collected, which included the prequalification data for firms and the levels of projects they handled. The summaries were converted into Excel format and used to feed an artificial neural network program. Using this program, the required information was extracted with a type of Kohonen network known as an SOM.

Keyfitz (1985) introduced the concept of entropy, and analysed this in the context of continuous changes in life expectancy.

In other words, a high level of entropy means that further reductions in mortality rates would have an impact on measures like life expectancy.
