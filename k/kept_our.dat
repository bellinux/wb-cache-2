Casualty estimates ranged from Dunmore's official report of 62 killed or wounded to an escaped patriot's report that the British losses totaled 102, excluding militia casualties. The only claimed rebel casualty was one man with a slight wound to the thumb. [...] Colonel William Woodford, reporting on the 2nd Virginia Regiment's service at the battle, wrote in a letter published in Purdie's Virginia Gazette, December 15, 1775: [...] "This was a second Bunker's Hill affair, in miniature; with this difference, that we <b>kept</b> <b>our</b> post, and had only one man wounded in the hand." ...|$|E

500|$|Aware that Imperial {{troops had}} {{breached}} the Schellenberg's defences Marlborough launched a third assault. This time the attackers formed a broader front, requiring d'Arco's men to spread their fire, thus reducing the deadly {{effectiveness of their}} musketry and grenades. But the defenders, including la Colonie, (unaware that the Imperialists had penetrated their left flank, and that d'Arco had retreated to Donauwörth), were still confident {{in their ability to}} repel the enemy– [...] "We remained steady at our post; our fire was regular as ever, and <b>kept</b> <b>our</b> opponents in check." [...] It was not long, however, before the Franco-Bavarian forces fighting on the hill became conscious of Baden's infantry approaching {{from the direction of the}} town. Many of the officers, including de la Colonie, initially thought that the advancing troops were reinforcements from DuBordet's garrison in Donauwörth, but it soon became apparent that they were in fact Baden's troops. [...] "They [...] arrived within gunshot of our flank about 7:30 in the evening, without our being aware of the possibility of such a thing." [...] Wrote de la Colonie. [...] "So occupied were we in defence of our own particular post..." [...] After establishing themselves at the summit of the Heights on the Allied right, Baden's men now fired upon the surprised defenders of the Schellenberg, compelling them to re-align in order to meet this unexpected threat. Consequently, Marlborough's assaulting troops on the Allied left, supported by a fresh echelon of dismounted English dragoons, were able to scramble over the now weakly defended breastwork and push the defenders back to the crown of the hill. The enemy at last fell into confusion.|$|E
500|$|During the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Spurs {{started with}} a lackluster 6–8 record and Popovich came under fire from the press. However, Duncan and Robinson stood behind their coach, and {{finished}} {{the season with a}} 31–5 run. The sophomore averaged 21.7 points, 11.4 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.5 blocks in the regular season, making both the All-NBA and All-Defense First Teams. In the 1999 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 3–1, swept the Los Angeles Lakers and the Portland Trail Blazers 4–0, and defeated the Cinderella story New York Knicks 4–1 in the Finals. In this series, a large contingent of Virgin Islanders flew over to support their local hero, and were not disappointed. In the first two games, the [...] "Twin Towers" [...] outscored their Knicks counterparts Chris Dudley/Larry Johnson with 41 points, 26 rebounds, and nine blocks versus five points, 12 rebounds, and zero blocks. After a Game 3 loss in which Duncan was held scoreless in the third quarter and committed three turnovers in the last quarter, Duncan bounced back with 28 points and 18 rebounds in a Game 4 win, and in Game 5, the Spurs protected a 78–77 lead seconds from the end with the ball in the Knicks' possession. Double teamed by Duncan and Robinson, Knicks swingman Latrell Sprewell missed a last-second desperation shot, and after closing out the series with a strong 31-point and 9-rebound showing in Game 5, Duncan was named Finals MVP, bringing San Antonio their first-ever NBA championship. The accolades for the Spurs soon arrived, with Sports Illustrated reporting that the San Antonio [...] "monkey has been shed", and that the Spurs were no longer known as the [...] "San Antonio softies". The magazine praised Finals MVP Duncan, who was later quoted: [...] "This is incredible. We <b>kept</b> <b>our</b> focus and we pulled it out." [...] Sports Illustrated journalist and retired NBA player Alex English added: [...] "Duncan came up big each time they went to him with that sweet turnaround jumper off the glass. He was the man tonight [...]" [...] And Popovich later said to losing coach Jeff Van Gundy: [...] "I've got Tim [...] and you don't. That's the difference." ...|$|E
500|$|Benfica began March {{competing}} {{at three}} levels: the Primeira Liga, the Portuguese Cup and the UEFA Cup. Their first game {{was at the}} Estádio José Alvalade against Sporting CP. Managed by Paulo Bento, the hosts scored the opening goal in the 11th minute with a header by Simon Vukčević. In the 40th minute, Rui Costa's corner kick allowed Cardozo to head in the tying goal. Benfica held second place, five points ahead of Sporting. For Camacho, the result was [...] "very important because we <b>kept</b> <b>our</b> advantage, allowing us to remain in second place". The following Thursday, Benfica hosted Getafe in the UEFA Cup. The match quickly soured for the club when Cardozo was sent off in the ninth minute, and Rubén de la Red scored Getafe's first goal in the 25th minute. During the second half Pablo Hernández added another, and Mantorras scored a 76th-minute consolation goal for Benfica. Camacho said, [...] "We started poorly because Getafe has a good team. With Cardozo's ejection, things got more complicated. In the second half, Benfica was better, the players fought and showed {{we have a chance}} to eliminate them." [...] On 9 March, Benfica hosted União de Leiria. They conceded an opening goal in the 42th minute, scoring two second-half goals in five minutes: one each by Zoro and Cardozo. Serge N'Gal scored a 69th-minute equaliser for the draw. The result had repercussions, as Camacho resigned: [...] "I cannot do anything else to improve this team's performance." [...] His resignation, so late in the season, caught Benfica's management by surprise. They opted to not replace him, nominating his assistant Fernando Chalana as manager. Chalana accepted the challenge: [...] "I am here through thick and thin." [...] His first game as manager was against Getafe on the road on 12 March. Benfica had to score two and allow none to progress; Makukula hit the post in the sixth minute, and Getafe qualified with a 77th-minute goal by Juan Ángel Albín. Four days later, Benfica played Marítimo at Barreiros, with Cardozo scoring his 19th goal of the season in the 26th minute. In the second half, Ytalo scored a 75th-minute equaliser for Marítimo. Chalana said, [...] "We had a great first half. We dominated and honestly I was not expecting Marítimo's goal. I was sad with the way it appeared. We did everything to win." [...] The fourth consecutive draw cost Benfica their lead over Vitória de Guimarães for second place. Back from international break, the club hosted Paços de Ferreira on 30 March in a 4–1 win. At half-time, the score was 1–1, but Cardozo and Rui Costa's second-half goals gave Benfica their first domestic win in March.|$|E

2500|$|In 1687, Isaac Newton {{stated the}} law of {{universal}} gravitation, described earlier as a hypothesis by Robert Hooke and others. His main achievement was to mathematically derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion from {{the law of}} gravitation, thus helping to prove the latter. This introduced gravitation as the force that both kept the Earth and planets moving through the heavens and also kept the air from flying away. [...] The theory of gravity allowed scientists to construct a plausible heliocentric model for the solar system quickly. In his Principia, Newton explained his system of how gravity, previously thought of as an occult force (that is, an unexplained force), directed the movements of celestial bodies, and <b>kept</b> <b>our</b> solar system in its working order. [...] His descriptions of centripetal force were a breakthrough in scientific thought which used the newly developed differential calculus, and finally replaced the previous schools of scientific thought, i.e. those of Aristotle and Ptolemy. [...] However, the process was gradual.|$|E

That's why I'm a bit confused why I got the penalty." [...] Mahindra was also fined €1,500 for unsafely releasing Heidfeld from his garage and into the path of Piquet. Dilbagh Gill described Heidfeld's rise up the field to finish in tenth place as a [...] "master class in wheel-to-wheel racing" [...] and said his team would look forward to preparing for the season's remaining races. Heidfeld called the result [...] "bittersweet" [...] as he stated his strong form meant had his sensor problem emerged in qualifying he could have finished in a higher position. Rosenqvist said with his team's strong pace in the two Berlin races, he believed he could further increase his advantage over Prost in the Drivers' Championship: [...] "It was a very long and tough weekend!
