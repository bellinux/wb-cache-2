5|$|During {{his student}} days, Gaudí {{attended}} craft workshops, {{such as those}} taught by Eudald Puntí, Llorenç Matamala and Joan Oñós, where he learned the basic aspects of techniques relating to architecture, including sculpture, carpentry, wrought ironwork, stained <b>glass,</b> <b>ceramics,</b> plaster modelling, etc. He also absorbed new technological developments, integrating into his technique the use of iron and reinforced concrete in construction. Gaudí took a broad view of architecture as a multifunctional design, in which every single detail in an arrangement has to be harmoniously made and well-proportioned. This knowledge allowed him to design architectural projects, including {{all the elements of}} his works, from furnishings to illumination to wrought ironwork.|$|E

25|$|The Wingo quarter farm {{dates from}} 1790-1812 at Poplar Forest and was {{operational}} when Jefferson owned Poplar Forest; {{he gave the}} land on which it was located to Martha and Thomas Mann Randolph as a wedding present. Jefferson's surviving notes tell us that three carpenters were able to construct a slave cabin in three days and that the slaves most often lived next to their field or shop work sites. Documentary {{evidence suggests that the}} slave housing structures at Poplar Forest were made of logs and that each house had two rooms that each measured 12.5 x 15 feet; this is corroborated by archaeological evidence suggesting that the slave structures contained root cellars designed by the occupants, which were used to store clothing, tools, and iron hardware. Archaeologists used soil stains to discover storage pits, burned tree roots, and postoles; this analysis also yielded fragments of <b>glass,</b> <b>ceramics,</b> and iron which were discovered to have been parts of plates, bottles, and cooking pots. One other structure discovered is believed to have functioned as a smokehouse as well as a residence, while a third {{is believed to have been}} built later than the other two, and used primarily as housing. Soil analysis also suggests that there were fences in the slave quarters.|$|E
500|$|The archaeological digs and {{investigation}} {{at the site}} were led by Floyd Mansberger of Fever River Research, {{in consultation with the}} Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, during the summer of 1995. The first portion of the investigation was an initial walkover of the site, which yielded some pre-Civil War artifacts. Subsequently, the research team [...] "lightly disked" [...] the site to perform a [...] "controlled surface collection." [...] The surface collection yielded a wide range of artifacts including different types of <b>glass,</b> <b>ceramics,</b> personal items, and small amounts of brick and stone structural materials. The items retrieved during the collection strongly suggested that occupation of the Apple River Fort site occurred during the early 19th century, probably not extending beyond 1860, and was short-term. The archeology at the site uncovered the original footprint of the fort, a smaller than estimated 50foot(15m) by 70foot(21m) area, and made significant contributions {{to the understanding of the}} nature of the early Apple River settlement.|$|E

40|$|This practice-led {{research}} {{investigates the}} feasibility of combining <b>glass</b> and <b>ceramics</b> in a hot state, {{as a means of}} artistic expression in studio practice. <b>Glass</b> and <b>ceramics</b> have many related material qualities and are processed in similar ways. Chemically they are alike however structurally they are very different, which creates compatibility problems when they are combined in a hot state. Through controlled processing, material properties can alter when each is partially converted into the other. It is recognised by artists in the field of studio ceramics that porcelain can partially convert into a glassy form when high fired to create a translucent material. Likewise it is recognised in the field of industrial engineering that glass can partially convert into a ceramic form when processed in a controlled way to create a glass-ceramic material; this material is not used by practitioners and would be difficult to develop in a studio environment. A total of 43 contemporary practitioners were found that worked in both <b>glass</b> & <b>ceramics</b> in their work. Of these only 16 practitioners combined <b>glass</b> and <b>ceramics</b> in a hot state, the majority combined them in a cold state to avoid compatibility issues. It became apparent that there is a distinct lack of published material on the combination of <b>glass</b> and <b>ceramics</b> in studio practice. It was the aim of this investigation to address this gap by identifying and testing potential hot state processing routes. This research addresses these issues through a multiple-method approach rooted in creative practice; directed by the following aims: • To develop the practical and creative parameters of the combination of <b>glass</b> and <b>ceramics</b> in a hot state. • To demonstrate and articulate the possible creative and practical benefits of the new processing routes as a model for practitioners in the field. • To articulate the significance of the research methods and results through the mapping of the field. Material testing was focused on artistic practice and experimentation which identified the creative parameters of combining <b>glass</b> and <b>ceramics</b> in a hot state, four potential process routes that combine <b>glass</b> and <b>ceramics</b> in a hot state were identified and tested. This testing was further extended and supported by the application of compatibility studies, which helped to match the expansion rates of <b>glass</b> and <b>ceramics</b> when they are combined. Bone china was identified as the closest fit to glass in terms of expansion rates; quartz was added to further improve the fit of the materials. Case studies of artists that work in <b>glass</b> and <b>ceramics</b> have been used to position the research within the field. New insights have emerged into the combined processing of <b>glass</b> and <b>ceramics</b> in a hot state. This approach offers a series of potential processing routes to be viewed as a model for others in the field. The final submission includes a thesis, a series of materials tests, and a body of related artworks that demonstrate the hot state combination of the materials...|$|R
