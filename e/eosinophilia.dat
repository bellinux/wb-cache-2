25|$|Until recently, {{peripheral}} <b>eosinophilia</b> (high eosinophil counts) {{was considered}} partly indicative of ABPA. More recent {{studies show that}} only 40% of ABPA sufferers present with <b>eosinophilia,</b> and hence a low eosinophil count does not necessary exclude ABPA; for example patients undergoing steroid therapy have lower eosinophil counts.|$|E
25|$|Clonal eosinophilias {{are caused}} by {{acquired}} genetic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells that leads to, or are associated with, a form of chronic eosinophilic leukemia or various forms of myeloid neoplasms, lymphoid neoplasms, myelofibrosis, or the myelodysplastic syndrome. The latter forms of clonal <b>eosinophilia</b> are commonly associated with blood or tissue <b>eosinophilia.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Eosinophilia</b> — an {{abnormally}} {{high number}} of eosinophils — the cells that fight off parasitic infections — in the blood.|$|E
25|$|Peripheral blood <b>eosinophilia</b> and {{elevated}} serum IgE are usual but not universal. The {{damage to the}} gastrointestinal tract wall is caused by eosinophilic infiltration and degranulation.|$|E
25|$|CMML-1 and CMML-2 can be {{additionally}} grouped as CMML-1 or CMML-2 with <b>eosinophilia.</b> These {{are diagnosed}} if the above criteria are met {{and the blood}} eosinophil count is >1.5x109/L.|$|E
25|$|Subserosal EG (4.5% to 9% in Japan and 13% in the US) {{presents}} with ascites {{which is}} usually exudative in nature, abundant peripheral <b>eosinophilia,</b> and has favourable responses to corticosteroids.|$|E
25|$|If the {{meninges}} are affected, CSF {{will show}} abnormally low glucose levels in CSF, an increased level of protein in the CSF, and lymphocytic pleocytosis. Rarely, CSF <b>eosinophilia</b> is present.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{cases have}} been {{associated}} with acute fever, myalgias, bronchospasm, pruritic rashes, lymphadenopathy, subcutaneous nodules associated with <b>eosinophilia,</b> elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated creatinine kinase levels. Symptoms may last as long as five years. Segmental necrotizing enteritis has been reported on one occasion.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) (≥ 1% of patients) {{associated with}} the cephalosporin therapy include: diarrhea, nausea, rash, electrolyte disturbances, and pain and inflammation at injection site. Infrequent ADRs (0.1–1% of patients) include vomiting, headache, dizziness, oral and vaginal candidiasis, pseudomembranous colitis, superinfection, <b>eosinophilia,</b> nephrotoxicity, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and fever.|$|E
25|$|A normal {{eosinophil}} {{count is}} considered to be less than 0.65/L. Eosinophil counts are higher in newborns and vary with age, time (lower in the morning and higher at night), exercise, environment, and exposure to allergens. <b>Eosinophilia</b> is never a normal lab finding. Efforts should always be made to discover the underlying cause, though the cause may not always be found.|$|E
25|$|As {{pathogens}} in the body, helminths induce {{an immune}} response. Immune-mediated inflammatory changes {{occur in the}} skin, lung, liver, intestine, central nervous system, and eyes. Signs of the body's immune response may include <b>eosinophilia,</b> edema, and arthritis. An example of the immune response is the hypersensitivity reaction {{that may lead to}} anaphylaxis. Another example is the migration of Ascaris larvae through the bronchi of the lungs causing asthma.|$|E
25|$|<b>Eosinophilia</b> {{is not a}} {{reliable}} measure of extent of infection because it varies from individual to individual. Some cases with multiple pairs of worms have reported low eosinophil levels, while other cases with a single pair had very high eosinophil counts. Such variation {{may be due to}} the lack of host tissue invasion by the parasite, since M. laryngeus attaches to the mucosal epithelium in the tracheolaryngeal region. A singular case even found worms within a cyst.|$|E
25|$|They {{primarily}} {{deal with}} parasitic infections. Eosinophils {{are also the}} predominant inflammatory cells in allergic reactions. The most important causes of <b>eosinophilia</b> include allergies such as asthma, hay fever, and hives; and also parasitic infections. They secrete chemicals that destroy these large parasites, such as hook worms and tapeworms, that are too big for any one WBC to phagocytize. In general, their nucleus is bi-lobed. The lobes are connected by a thin strand. The cytoplasm is full of granules that assume a characteristic pink-orange color with eosin staining.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 the WHO Classification of Myeloid Neoplasms was published, {{classifying}} CMML into a {{new group}} of diseases, the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), reflecting the disease's neoplastic nature. Other diseases in this category are juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia, atypical CML; BCR-ABL1 negative and MDS/MPD unclassifiable. These MDS/MPN overlap syndromes have effective production of some lineages of blood cells, but show ineffective proliferation of other lineages. The 2008 revision of the classification moved cases of CMML with PDGFR gene translocations to a new group, myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with <b>eosinophilia</b> with abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB or FGFR1.|$|E
25|$|The first {{appearance}} of eggs in stools is 60–70 days. In larval ascariasis, symptoms occur 4–16 days after infection. The final symptoms are gastrointestinal discomfort, colic and vomiting, fever, and observation of live worms in stools. Some patients may have pulmonary symptoms or neurological disorders during migration of the larvae. There are generally {{few or no}} symptoms. A bolus of worms may obstruct the intestine; migrating larvae may cause pneumonitis and <b>eosinophilia.</b> Adult worms have a lifespan of 1–2 years which means that individuals may be infected all their lives as worms die and new worms are acquired.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally {{minocycline}} therapy {{may result}} in autoimmune disorders such as drug related lupus and auto-immune hepatitis; minocycline induced auto-immune hepatitis when it occurs usually occurs in men who also developed minocycline induced lupus, however, women {{are the most likely}} to develop minocycline induced lupus. Significant or complete recovery occurs in most people who develop minocycline induced autoimmune problems within a period of a couple of weeks to a year of cessation of minocycline therapy. Autoimmune problems emerge during chronic therapy but can sometimes occur after only short courses of a couple of weeks of therapy. Drug Reaction with <b>Eosinophilia</b> and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome can occur during the first few weeks of therapy with minocycline.|$|E
25|$|The dose-limiting {{side effects}} are liver damage, lung disease and immunosuppression. The most common side effects (occurring in >1% of those treated with it) are, in {{approximately}} descending order of frequency: diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, hair loss, high blood pressure, rash, nausea, bronchitis, headache, abdominal pain, abnormal liver function tests, back pain, indigestion, urinary tract infection, dizziness, infection, joint disorder, itchiness, weight loss, loss of appetite, cough, gastroenteritis, pharyngitis, stomatitis, tenosynovitis, vomiting, weakness, allergic reaction, chest pain, dry skin, eczema, paraesthesia, pneumonia, rhinitis, synovitis, cholelithiasis and shortness of breath. Whereas uncommon side effects (occurring in 0.1-1% of those {{treated with the}} drug) include: constipation, oral thrush, stomatitis, taste disturbance, thrombocytopenia and hives. Rarely (in 0.1% of those treated with it) it can cause: anaphylaxis, angiooedema, anaemia, agranulocytosis, <b>eosinophilia,</b> leucopenia, pancytopenia, vasculitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, severe infection, interstitial lung disease, cirrhosis and liver failure.|$|E
25|$|In blood, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and <b>eosinophilia</b> may be {{observed}} in all types of fasciolosis. Elevation of liver enzyme activities, such a glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), is detected in subacute or chronic fasciolosis from 12 to 15 weeks after ingestion of metacercariae. Economical effect of fasciolosis in sheep consists in sudden deaths of animals {{as well as in}} reduction of weight gain and wool production. In goats and cattle, the clinical manifestation is similar to sheep. However, acquired resistance to F. hepatica infection is well known in adult cattle. Calves are susceptible to disease but in excess of 1000 metacercariae are usually required to cause clinical fasciolosis. In this case the disease is similar to sheep and is characterized by weight loss, anemia, hypoalbuminemia and (after infection with 10,000 metacercariae) death. Importance of cattle fasciolosis consist in economic losses caused by condemnation of livers at slaughter and production losses especially due to reduced weight gain.|$|E
25|$|Hookworm {{infection}} {{is generally considered}} to be asymptomatic, but as Norman Stoll described in 1962, hookworm {{infection is}} an extremely dangerous infection because its damage is “silent and insidious.” There are general symptoms that an individual may experience soon after infection. Ground-itch, which is an allergic reaction at the site of parasitic penetration and entry, is common in patients infected with N. americanus. Additionally, cough and pneumonitis may result as the larvae begin to break into the alveoli and travel up the trachea. Then once the larvae reach the small intestine of the host and begin to mature, the infected individual will suffer from diarrhea and other gastrointestinal discomfort. However, the “silent and insidious” symptoms referred to by Stoll are related to chronic, heavy-intensity hookworm infections. Major morbidity associated with hookworm infection is caused by intestinal blood loss, iron deficiency anemia, and protein malnutrition. They result mainly from adult hookworms in the small intestine ingesting blood, rupturing erythrocytes, and degrading hemoglobin in the host. This long-term blood loss can manifest itself physically through facial and peripheral edema; <b>eosinophilia</b> and pica caused by iron deficiency anemia are also experienced by some hookworm-infected patients. Recently, more attention has been given to other important outcomes of hookworm infection that play a large role in public health. It is now widely accepted that children who suffer from chronic hookworm infection can suffer from growth retardation as well as intellectual and cognitive impairments. Additionally, recent research has focused on the potential of adverse maternal-fetal outcomes when the mother is infected with hookworm during pregnancy.|$|E

500|$|An {{association}} of CASS4 with atopic asthma has been shown. CASS4 {{has also been}} reported to be an eosinophil-associated gene, with expression in sputum cells increased more than 1.5-fold after whole lung allergen challenge. Moreover, the CASS4 mRNA was upregulated in cells collected by bronchoalveolar lavage after segmental broncho-provocation with an allergen. Reciprocally, the CASS4 mRNA was downregulated when this procedure was performed following administration of mepolizumab (a humanized monoclonal anti-IL-5 antibodies which reduces excessive <b>eosinophilia).</b> [...] This suggests CASS4 activity may be associated with immune response in the context of atopic asthma development.|$|E

2500|$|In {{volunteer}} {{studies with}} infected beef symptoms appeared 3–6 hours after eating. These included anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, distension, diarrhea, vomiting, dyspnoea and tachycardia. All symptoms were transient and lasted about 36 hours. In a second series symptoms — abdominal pain, distension, watery diarrhea and <b>eosinophilia</b> — appeared [...] at 1 week and resolved after 3 weeks.|$|E
2500|$|As larval stages {{travel through}} the body, they may cause visceral damage, {{peritonitis}} and inflammation, enlargement of the liver or spleen, and an inflammation of the lungs. Pulmonary manifestations take place [...] during [...] larval migration and may present as Loeffler's syndrome, [...] a transient respiratory illness associated with blood <b>eosinophilia</b> and pulmonary infiltrates with radiographic shadowing.|$|E
2500|$|Blood films {{display a}} range of abnormalities. A {{monocyte}} count of >1x109/L is essential for a diagnosis of CMML. Other features may include; leukocytosis (50% of cases); left shift and dysplasia of monocytes and granulocytes; presence of metamyelocytes, myelocytes and promonocytes; monocytes with hypersegmented/abnormal shaped nuclei, increased cytoplasmic basophilia and/or the presence of cytoplasmic granules; <b>eosinophilia</b> (in cases of CMML with eosinophilia); and spherocytosis (in cases of DCT positive haemolytic anaemia). Platelet counts may be reduced, increased or normal. Haemoglobin levels are usually reduced with normocytic and normochromic red blood cells. Autoantibodies and cold agglutinins may be present and 10% of CMML is DCT positive.|$|E
50|$|HES is a {{diagnosis}} of exclusion, after clonal <b>eosinophilia</b> (such as FIP1L1-PDGFRA-fusion induced hypereosinophelia and leukemia) and reactive <b>eosinophilia</b> (in response to infection, autoimmune disease, atopy, hypoadrenalism, tropical <b>eosinophilia,</b> or cancer) have been ruled out.|$|E
5000|$|Familial <b>eosinophilia</b> {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} disorder {{characterized by}} the presence of sustained elevations in blood eosinophil levels that reach ranges diagnostic of <b>eosinophilia</b> (i.e. 500-1500/microliter) or, far more commonly,hypereosinophilia (i.e. >1,500/microliter). Although high eosinophil levels are associated with certain diseases and thought to contribute to the tissue destruction found in many other eosinophilia-related diseases (see clonal <b>eosinophilia),</b> clinical manifestations and tissue destruction related to the <b>eosinophilia</b> in familial <b>eosinophilia</b> is uncommon: this genetic disease typically has a benign phenotype and course compared to other congenital and acquired eosinophilic diseases.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Eosinophilia</b> is a {{condition}} in which the eosinophil count in the peripheral blood exceeds [...] Eosinophils usually account for less than 7% of the circulating leukocytes. A marked increase in non-blood tissue eosinophil count noticed upon histopathologic examination is diagnostic for tissue <b>eosinophilia.</b> Several causes are known, with the most common being some form of allergic reaction or parasitic infection. Diagnosis of <b>eosinophilia</b> is via a complete blood count (CBC), but diagnostic procedures directed at the underlying cause vary depending on the suspected condition(s). An absolute eosinophil count is not generally needed if the CBC shows marked <b>eosinophilia.</b> The location of the causal factor can be used to classify <b>eosinophilia</b> into two general types: extrinsic, in which the factor lies outside of the eosinophil cell lineage; and intrinsic <b>eosinophilia,</b> which denotes etiologies within the eosiniphil cell line. [...] Specific treatments are dictated by the causative condition, though in idiopathic <b>eosinophilia,</b> the disease may be controlled with corticosteroids. <b>Eosinophilia</b> is not a disorder (rather, only a sign) unless it is idiopathic.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that there is not necessarily any <b>eosinophilia</b> in the disseminated disease. Absence of <b>eosinophilia</b> may indicate poor prognosis.|$|E
50|$|Tropical and sub-tropical {{regions are}} the main areas {{affected}} by nematodes and parasitic worms, which often causes filariasis. Around 20% of immigrants to Spain are children from these regions. There are concerns about absolute <b>eosinophilia</b> in immigrants that is correlated with parasitic diseases that may go undiagnosed. Absolute <b>eosinophilia</b> is clinically diagnosed as >0.45×109 eosinophilic leucocytes/L of peripheral blood. Recent studies suggest that around 60% of children with relative <b>eosinophilia</b> contracted this via parasitic infections. Relative <b>eosinophilia</b> is different from absolute because relative refers {{to an increase in}} percentage of white blood cells (i.e. leukocytes) due to a loss of blood plasma; where as absolute <b>eosinophilia</b> is purely an increase in white blood cell production. Of those with relative <b>eosinophilia,</b> 40% were undiagnosed until these studies. Therefore, there is a great need for thorough parasitological studies in this area of tropical infectious diseases.|$|E
50|$|Lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia is a {{rare disease}} in which <b>eosinophilia</b> is caused by {{aberrant}} T cell lymphocytes which secrete cytokines (e.g. interleukin-5) that stimulate the proliferation of eosinophil precursor cells. The disease, which occasionally proceeds to a malignant lymphocytic phase, clearly reflects a clonal disturbance in lymphocytes, not eosinophils, and therefore is not a clonal hypereosinophilia. Similar non-clonal <b>eosinophilia</b> due to eosinophil precursor cell stimulation by clonal malignant cells is sometimes seen in cases of Hodgkin disease, B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphomas, T cell leukemias, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Other hematological diseases are associated with <b>eosinophilia</b> but regarded as clonal <b>eosinophilia</b> associated with a more important clonal malignancy in another cell type. For example, <b>eosinophilia</b> occurs in 20% to 30% of patients with systemic mastocytosis. Also referred to as SM-eo (systemic mastocytosis with <b>eosinophilia)</b> or SM-SEL (systemic mastocytosis with chronic eosinophilic leukemia), this disease's clonal eosinophils bear the same driving mutation, D816V in theKIT gene, as the clonal mast cells.|$|E
50|$|Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} (Hodgkin's disease) often elicits severe eosinophilia; however, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia produce less marked <b>eosinophilia.</b> Of {{solid tumor}} neoplasms, ovarian cancer {{is most likely}} to provoke <b>eosinophilia,</b> though any other cancer can cause the condition. Solid epithelial cell tumors have been shown to cause both tissue and blood <b>eosinophilia,</b> with some reports indicating that this may be mediated by interleukin production by tumor cells, especially IL-5 or IL-3. This has also been shown to occur in Hodgkin lymphoma, in the form of IL-5 secreted by Reed-Sternberg cells. In primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma, blood and dermal <b>eosinophilia</b> are often seen. Lymphoma cells have also been shown to produce IL-5 in these disorders. Other types of lymphoid malignancies have been associated with <b>eosinophilia,</b> as in lymphoblastic leukemia with a translocation between chromosomes 5 and 14 or alterations in the genes which encode platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha or beta. Patients displaying <b>eosinophilia</b> overexpress a gene encoding an eosinophil hematopoietin. A translocation between chromosomes 5 and 14 in patients with acute B lymphocytic leukemia resulted in the juxtaposition of the IL-3 gene and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene, causing overproduction production of IL-3, leading to blood and tissue <b>eosinophilia.</b>|$|E
