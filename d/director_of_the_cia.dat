After {{suggesting}} that the KGB use the knowledge of both the Virtuous Mission and Operation Snake Eater to blackmail the United States during future negotiations, he then calls another, unidentified man.

5|$|Alex is able {{to prove}} her innocence in the Grand Central Terminal bombing {{with the help of}} her classmates at Quantico and discovers that the {{suspected}} bomber was former FBI analyst-trainee Elias Harper (Rick Cosnett), who had planted the bomb under the instruction of a terrorist mastermind. Having cleared her name in a congressional hearing, Alex is reinstated as an FBI agent and assigned to the field office in New York City, specifically the operations section, and now strives to uncover the true mastermind behind the bombings as the 2016 Presidential election draws ever closer.

25|$|According to Gray, {{this plan}} was first put into action {{when he had}} a meeting with Vernon Walters, then deputy <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> in which he quotes Walters as falsely saying, “If the {{investigation}} gets pushed further south of the border… it could trespass onto some of our covert projects.
