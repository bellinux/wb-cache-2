5|$|On May 4, 1925, Rossi sent {{a letter}} to Mint Director Robert J. Grant. Rossi noted that there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> delay in the {{preparation}} of the design for the new half dollar, and that California Senator Samuel M. Shortridge had urged Rossi's committee to move forward without delay. Rossi enclosed sketches by California sculptor Joseph (Jo) Mora, with the promise that a finished design, and a model, would follow. Citizens' Committee members had selected Mora unanimously, feeling he was the one artist who could capture the spirit of what was being commemorated.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{signing the}} Kano Accord, Libya was incensed that the GUNT {{did not include}} any {{of the leaders of}} the Volcan Army and had not {{recognized}} Libyan claims on the Aouzou Strip. Since 13 April there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> minor Libyan military activity in northern Chad, and support was provided to the secessionist movement in the south. However, a major response came only after 25 June, when the ultimatum of Chad's neighbors for the formation of a new, more inclusive coalition government expired. On 26 June, 2,500 Libyan troops invaded Chad, heading for Faya-Largeau. The Chadian government appealed for French help. The Libyan forces were first stymied by Goukouni's militiamen, and then forced to retreat by French reconnaissance planes and bombers. In the same month, the factions excluded by the GUNT founded a counter-government, the Front for Joint Provisional Action (FACP), in northern Chad with Libyan military support.|$|E
5|$|Goaltenders {{have participated}} in the offence, albeit in a limited way, since the {{earliest}} days of the sport. Before the creation of the NHL in 1917, there were some instances recorded of goaltenders rushing down the ice to participate in the play, occasionally scoring a goal. This practice has since been outlawed (goalies are not allowed to cross the centre red line to play the puck) after the Toronto Maple Leafs' Gary Smith was injured on such a rush in the 196667 NHL season. During the history of the league, there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> near-misses by goaltenders, including attempts by Chuck Rayner by aiming at the empty net, or joining the attack. In 1977, Rogatien Vachon briefly became the first goaltender to score a goal after being credited following an own goal by the opponent, before it was given instead to a teammate by later video review.|$|E

5|$|Henry IV {{was plagued}} with {{financial}} problems, the political need to reward his supporters, frequent rebellions and declining healthincluding leprosy and epilepsy. The Percy family <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> of Henry's leading supporters, defending the North from Scotland largely {{at their own}} expense, but revolted {{in the face of}} lack of reward and suspicion from Henry. Henry Percy (Hotspur) was defeated and killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury. In 1405, Hotspur's father Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, supported the Archbishop of York, Richard le Scrope, in another rebellion, after which the elder Percy fled to Scotland and his estates were confiscated. Henry had Scrope executed in an act comparable to the murder of another ArchbishopThomas Becket by men loyal to Henry II. This would probably have led to Henry's excommunication but the church {{was in the midst of}} the Western Schism, with competing popes keen on Henry's support; it protested but took no action. In 1408, Percy invaded England once more and was killed at the Battle of Bramham Moor. In Wales, Owain Glyndŵr's widespread rebellion was only suppressed with the recapture of Harlech Castle in 1409, although sporadic fighting continued until 1421.|$|E
5|$|On 7 March, at the Battle of Craonne, another {{incident}} occurred, seemingly indicating that there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> sort of disagreement between the General and the Emperor. As {{the battle was}} raging, General Belliard from the Emperor's staff came to Nansouty {{and told him that}} he had orders to relieve him of command should his health prevent him from exercising his duties. Nansouty responded that he was indeed ill, but {{that he was able to}} retain command. Although in unusually bad humour after this incident, Nansouty subsequently led a most brilliant action at Craonne. He was ordered to cross bogged and broken terrain, and climb a steep incline with his cavalry and artillery, in order to fall on the enemy's right flank. Managing to bring his cavalrymen on the ridge, Nansouty formed them in line and launched them against the enemy, pushing back in disorder two Russian battalions. Nansouty was again wounded during this action, but this injury was not very serious and he continued to energetically lead his men. Napoleon then allegedly ordered Nansouty to assault a redoubt, under the most murderous fire. Nonetheless, Nansouty ordered his men to halt and advanced alone towards the position. Asked to explain his behaviour, he replied that he would not send his men to die in vain and that he would be attacking alone. Napoleon at once revoked his order.|$|E
5|$|Roquebert {{had learned}} the correct signals for Spanish {{shipping}} from captured Spanish merchant ships and, having lured Junon within range, opened a destructive fire from Renommée that caused severe damage to Junons rigging. Unable to manoeuvere away from the French due to the damage suffered in the opening broadside, Shortland returned fire {{as best he could}} while closing with Renommée to inflict maximum damage. As Junon closed with the flagship, Clorinde attacked her from the other side and the flûtes took up stations fore and aft, repeatedly raking the British ship. Observateur <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> distance behind Junon when the action began, and was thus not directly engaged by any of the French ships. Wetherall initially fired at Clorinde from extreme range, but soon recognised that he could do nothing to aid Junon in the face of overwhelming French numbers and so sailed westward to find and warn other British ships of the approaching French squadron. As Observateur escaped, Junon was pounded from all sides, Roquebert's ship coming so close to the British frigate that their rigging tangled and they collided, inflicting further damage. The French squadron was so close to Junon that the soldiers carried aboard for the garrison on Guadeloupe were able to fire their muskets at the British top deck, killing many of the sailors manning the guns.|$|E
