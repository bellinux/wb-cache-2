40|$|In today’s {{world of}} {{advanced}} technology, numerous applications are computational intensive. This {{led to the}} development of new System-on-Chip (SoC) design techniques to allow for integration and reuse of Intellectual Property, <b>IP</b> <b>Cores,</b> under time-to-market pressure. A wide range of these newly emerging design platforms is now drifting towards highly integrated SoC designs with many on-chip processing resources like processors, DSPs, and memory. Using this technique, designers can build SoC by integrating dozens of <b>IP</b> <b>cores.</b> As the number of <b>IP</b> <b>cores</b> increases, the on-chip communication and physical interconnections become a bottleneck. Originally, SoC was built based on a Bus-Centered approach. The Bus-Centered approach is a shared-medium architecture in which all <b>IP</b> <b>cores</b> share the same transmission medium. The Bus architecture is widely used in current SoC implementation and will continue to be the right design platform for small designs that integrate a few <b>IP</b> <b>cores.</b> However, for designs targeting FPGA with a large number of <b>IP</b> <b>cores,</b> we will propose a Micronetwork based System-on-FPGA (SoFPGA...|$|R

30|$|Xilinx {{offers two}} types of floating-point IP cores: AXI-based and non-AXI-based. For the register-based HW_v 1, we use the {{standard}} AXI-based <b>IP</b> <b>cores</b> for the fundamental operators. These <b>IP</b> <b>cores</b> provide standardized communications and buffering capabilities and occupy less area on chip, {{at the expense of}} higher latency. For the BRAM-based HW_v 2, we utilize the non-AXI-based <b>IP</b> <b>cores</b> for the fundamental operators. These <b>IP</b> <b>cores</b> allow the lowest latency adder (5 -cycle latency) and multiplier (1 -cycle latency) units to support 100  MHz system clock, at the expense of occupying more area on chip. The non-AXI-based cores have less stringent control and communication protocols; thus, proper timing of signals is required to obtain accurate results. With HW_v 2, we manage to use lower latency but more resource-intensive <b>IP</b> <b>cores,</b> since it consists of fewer multipliers and adders, whereas with HW_v 1, we have to use higher latency but less resource-intensive <b>IP</b> <b>cores,</b> since it comprises large number of multipliers and adders, due to the parallel processing nature of the design.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel test {{methodology}} for testing <b>IP</b> <b>cores</b> in SoCs with embedded processor cores.

The test program can also use the processor core to generate test patterns. This provides tremendous flexibility {{in the type of}} patterns that {{can be applied to the}} <b>IP</b> <b>cores</b> without incurring significant hardware overhead. We use a bus based SoC simulation model to validate our test methodology. The test methodology involves addition of a test wrapper that can be configured for specific test needs.

40|$|Abstract. At Leiden Embedded Research Center, we are {{building}} a tool chain called Compaan/Laura {{that allows us to}} do fast mapping of applications written in Matlab onto reconfigurable platforms, such as FPGAs, using <b>IP</b> <b>cores</b> to implement the data-path of the applications.

These selfloops have a large impact on the utilization of <b>IP</b> <b>cores</b> in the final hardware implementation of a PN, especially if the <b>IP</b> <b>cores</b> are deeply pipelined. In this paper, we present an exploration methodology that uses feedback provided by the Laura tool to increase the utilization of <b>IP</b> <b>cores</b> embedded in our PN network.
