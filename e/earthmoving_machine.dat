Numerical representation of granular materials and methodology to validate and verify constitutive micro-mechanical models in DEM will be presented. In addition, how DEM codes can be integrated to CAE tools such as multibody dynamics will also be discussed. A case study of tillage bar-soil interaction was modeled in EDEM to predict tillage draft force and soil failure zone in front of tool moving at 2. 68 -m/sec and depth of 102 -mm.

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{automating}} an <b>earthmoving</b> <b>machine,</b> we have developed a model of soil-tool interaction that predicts resistive forces experienced at the tool during digging.

In this paper, we extend {{the state of the art}} in two ways. First, we present a reformulated version of the classical Fundamental Equation of Earthmoving often used to model soil-tool interaction. The new model includes consideration of previously unaccounted phenomena in the interaction of an excavator bucket as it moves through soil. Secondly, given that soil properties can vary even within a work site, we present an on-line method to estimate soil parameters from measured force data. Finally, we show how the predicted resistive force is used to estimate bucket trajectories. ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that {{the reduction of}} noise levels is not strictly linked to the reduction of noise annoyance. Even <b>earthmoving</b> <b>machine</b> manufacturers are facing the problem of customer complaints concerning the noise quality of their machines with increasing frequency. Unfortunately, all the studies geared {{to the understanding of}} the relationship between multidimensional characteristics of noise signals and the auditory perception of annoyance require repeated sessions of jury listening tests, which are time-consuming. In this respect, an annoyance prediction model was developed for compact loaders to assess the annoyance sensation perceived by operators at their workplaces without repeating the full sound quality assessment but using objective parameters only. This paper aims at verifying the feasibility of the developed annoyance prediction model when applied to other kinds of earthmoving machines. For this purpose, an experimental investigation was performed on five earthmoving machines, different in type, dimension, and engine mechanical power, and the annoyance predicted by the numerical model was compared to the annoyance given by subjective listening tests. The results were evaluated by means of the squared value of the correlation coefficient, R 2, and they confirm the possible applicability of the model to other kinds of machines...|$|E

40|$|Draglines {{are one of}} {{the largest}} <b>earthmoving</b> <b>machines</b> in surface mining. They are {{employed}} to remove the overburden near the surface, giving access to a seam of the target mineral or coal underneath. Their excavation productivity is significantly affected by the high-level operation strategy of where to position the dragline, what to dig at each position and where to dump the removed material. This letter explores the potential of using the Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm for planning this operation strategy. To this end, we adapt the MCTS algorithm to compute the dragline positioning sequences when a fixed digging and dumping strategy is applied at each position. The performance of the adapted MCTS algorithm is compared to a previously developed A* search algorithm and a greedy algorithm. Simulation results show that the MCTS algorithm is able to find near-optimal positioning sequences using significantly less time and memory than the A* algorithm. The solutions from the MCTS algorithm also largely outperform the solutions from the greedy algorithm in all the test scenarios. These results suggest that the MCTS algorithm can be used to plan the operation strategy when decisions about the digging and dumping operations are also considered...|$|R

40|$|Rollover {{protective}} structures {{play a vital}} role in protecting the operators of large <b>earthmoving</b> <b>machines</b> which are commonly used in the rural and mining sectors. These structures typically consist of a moment resisting steel frame that is required to withstand the impact forces sustained by the vehicle during a rollover and provide a survival space for the operator during such an event. Recent advances in analytical modelling techniques have made it possible to model accurately the response behaviour of these types of structures when subjected to load and energy requirements according to current performance standards adopted both in Australia and internationally. This paper is concerned with the response behaviour of a rollover protective structure (ROPS) fitted to a 125 tonne rigid frame dump truck. Destructive experimental testing which involved the application of static loads to simulate the impact forces created during a rollover has been conducted on a ½ scale model ROPS for this particular vehicle. The testing program has involved complete instrumentation of the ROPS to enable corresponding member stresses and deflections to be recorded. In addition to this, non-linear finite element analysis has also been performed on this ROPS using the FEA software package ABAQUS version 6. 3. The first stage of this computer analysis involved subjecting the ROPS to static loads about the lateral, vertical and longitudinal axes of the ROPS and comparing, results with those obtained from the experimental investigation and calibrating the computer model. Further research will involve using the calibrated finite element models to carry out dynamic simulations incorporating energy absorbing devices in the ROPS to optimize the level of energy absorption and enhance performance and operator safety...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. There are many factors that can influence the effectiveness of any risk management strategy, {{in the case of}} whole-body vibration exposure many problems are faced with the quantification of risk, measurement of risk and subsequent risk reduction. The quantification of vibration effects is equally as complex as the quantification of vibration itself. Exposure to whole-body vibration (WBV) causes a distribution of motions and forces within the human body and to complicate matters the transmission of vibration to the body is also dependent on body posture. To-date there has been little attempt to accurately reflect many of the typical postures and vibration environments experienced by operators of earth moving machines in a laboratory setting. The overall aim of the thesis was to determine the variability between humans, machines and task environments in order to provide knowledge to inform improvements in methods of risk management for whole-body vibration exposure. The field measurement phase of the research focused on characterising features of whole-body vibration exposure among operators of <b>earthmoving</b> <b>machines</b> throughout a range of industry sectors. Some of the biggest industries; coal mining, quarries, and construction were targeted to obtain data on the types of machines for which very little was previously available.

Micro-computer based decision support systems and operational research models {{can be used}} as tools at different phases or construction projects to improve the productivity and to minimize the cost. [...] Among the wide variety of operations on many construction projects, the earthmoving operation plays an important role. Selection of the most appropriate type, size, and number of machines, and the optimal distribution of the cut and the fill quantities of soil are therefore significant in reducing the overall cost of a construction project. [...] In this thesis, a micro-computer based decision support system is developed for selecting the most economical group of <b>machines</b> for an <b>earthmoving</b> project. An operational research model based on the transportation algorithm is also introduced to find the optimal cut and fill distribution of an earthmoving operation. [...] The developed micro-computer based decision support system consists of a computer program, which simulates a consultation between an expert in equipment selection and a. user. It presents a series of questions and a series of answers for which the user has to respond according to the requirements and the conditions of the earthmoving operation. For convenience, the system is developed in three phases. [...] In {{the first phase of the}} system, the selection of the suitable types of equipment for the earthmoving operation is made from eleven different types of <b>earthmoving</b> <b>machines.</b> In the second phase of the system, after checking the height and weight constraints that may be applicable to the site and to the haul roads, the production rates of all the models and sizes of the usable machines are determined. By comparing the cost per unit volume of material handled by each group of machines, the most economical group is determined in the final phase, to suit the scheduled duration and the total quantity of material to be handled of the earthworks project. Also, the cost per unit volume of material to be handled, the expected production rates, and the durations of the employable groups of machines are presented to the user. [...] Once the most economical group of machines is decided, using the introduced operational research model, the optimal distribution of cut and fill quantities of an earthworks operation can be deduced.

If these machines were targeted for a WBV health risk assessment then the measurement durations will need to take account of this variation in the extrapolation to an 8 -hour exposure. The operators of these tracked machines were also found to adopt non-neutral twisted postures during reversing manoeuvres. The twisted posture adopted by the bulldozer and tracked loader operators was recreated in the laboratory. Findings demonstrated that operators are likely to be putting their necks in a vulnerable position in the twisted posture due to the large increase in rotational movement at the head during exposure to vibration. Decrements in reaction time performance and increases in workload were also found while individuals were sat in a twisted posture and exposed to vibration.
