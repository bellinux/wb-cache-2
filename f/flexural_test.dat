40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} longitudinal shear transfer mechanism in composite shallow cellular floor beams. The shear transfer mechanism is different with the headed shear studs used in composite construction. The shear resisting properties and behaviour of the shear transfer mechanism {{has not been}} studied previously. Experimental and analytical {{studies were carried out}} with the aims of improving and optimizing the design details, and advancing the method of shear connection in shallow floor beam construction. The composite shallow cellular floor beam investigated in this research is a new type of beam fabricated by welding two highly asymmetric cellular tees along the web. The shear connections of this type of composite beam are formed by the web openings, which transfer longitudinal shear force. Four types of these shear connections were studied: concrete-infill-only, tie-bar, ducting and web-welded-stud shear connections. In total, 24 push-out tests were performed in two test series to investigate the load-slip behaviour and shear resistance of the shear connections under direct shear force. The failure mechanisms of the two forms of shear connections were extensively studied, which lead {{to the development of a}} design method for the composite action. The concrete infill element passing through the web opening is subject to a complex three-dimensional stress state, and it is difficult to analyse it using the mathematical model rather than empirical formula. Finite Element Analysis of the concrete-infill-only shear connection was performed with a parametric study to further verify the design method that has been developed. Two <b>flexural</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out on a full-scale composite shallow cellular floor beam with a solid slab. The shear connections investigated in the <b>flexural</b> <b>tests</b> were: concrete-infill-only and tie-bar shear connections passed through the web.
