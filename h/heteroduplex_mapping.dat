In this study, two tRNAile isoacceptor species have been identified by reverse-phase chromatography and shown to be transcribed from two different tRNA loci along the T 5 chromosome. The map positions of the tRNA isoacceptors were aided {{by the use of}} several T 5 deletion mutants in which the position and size of the deleted DNA segments had been previously determined by <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>mapping.</b> Hybridization analysis suggests the presence of some sequence homology between the two tRNAile species...|$|E
40|$|A {{restriction}} {{map of the}} bacteriophage T 4 genome was aligned with the T 4 genetic map. Included were the cleavage sites for BamHI, BglII, KpnI, PvuI, SalI, and XbaI. The alignment utilized {{the fact that the}} T 4 genetic map had been oriented previously with respect to a T 2 /T 4 <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>map.</b> DNA fragments from a BglII digestion of cytosine-containing DNA from a T 4 dCTPase- denA denB(rIIH 23 B) alc mutant were hybridized with full-length chromosomal strands of bacteriophage T 2, and the heteroduplexes were examined by electron microscopy. From their lengths and patterns of substitution and deletion loops, the heteroduplexes formed with 6 of the 13 BglII fragments could be unambiguously identified and positioned on the T 2 /T 4 <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>map.</b> The ends of the T 4 DNA strands in the heteroduplexes directly identified the location of 10 BglII cleavage sites. The remaining three BglII cleavage sites could be assigned to the T 2 /T 4 <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>map</b> based on their relative locations on the {{restriction map}}. It was also possible to identify the source of the DNA strands (i. e., T 2 or T 4) in four previously unassigned deletion loops on the T 2 /T 4 heteroduplex. Among the BglII fragments identified in heteroduplexes was the fragment containing the rIIH 23 B deletion; this deletion was used as the primary point of reference for alignment of the T 4 restriction map with the T 2 /T 4 <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>map</b> and, hence, with the T 4 genetic map...|$|R
40|$|Heteroduplex {{analysis}} of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from evolutionary closely related mammals (rat vs. mouse, man vs. monkey) are analyzed and compared to heteroduplex {{analysis of}} mt-DNA from more distantly related mammals (rat vs. man, rat vs. monkey, mouse vs. man, mouse vs. monkey and man vs. cow). Each analysis {{is transformed into}} a <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>map</b> and all maps are aligned to restriction enzyme maps and to genetic maps and where possible compared with the known sequence. We show that early evolutionary changes are seen mainly in URF 2, URFA 6 L, URF 6 and the D-loop region. The regions of rRNA, URF 1, COI and COIII are generally very conserved regions but areas with some evolutionary activity can be localized. Heteroduplex analysis between distantly related species show much more heterology than do closely related species and the <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>maps</b> between all the distantly related species show a common pattern of heterology. Comparisons between the DNA sequence of mtDNA from man, cow and mouse and the equivalent <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>maps</b> show that base pair homologies higher than 73 % are displayed as homologous regions.

These studies also identify extensive regions of homology 5 ' to both mu and alpha constant region genes that are conserved between the two genes as well as between mouse and man. These segments encompass regions in which mu/alpha recombination occurs during the heavy chain class switch, and their extensive homology may be relevant to this process...|$|E

Blot hybridization experiments, performed under stringent conditions, revealed no cross-hybridization between this HPV DNA and the other known HPV DNAs, showing that this HPV represents a new type, tentatively named HPV 34. In relaxed hybridization conditions, the highest cross-hybridization was observed with HPV 16 DNA. The physical map of HPV 34 DNA was aligned with the genetic map of HPV 16 DNA by <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>mapping.</b> HPV 34 was not detected in 12 additional patients with Bowen's disease of the skin, but a closely related HPV DNA was found in one patient with penile Bowenoid papulosis...|$|E

The single Eco RI site of G 4 -RF was utilized {{as a physical}} marker by preparing the heteroduplexes from the denatured, linear DNA obtained by r«stricting G 4 -RF with Eco RI endonuclease. Restriction fragments of 0 X were used in a separate series of heteroduplexes to align the <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>map</b> and the G 4 Eco RI site with the similar genetic maps of the two phages. The positions of the branch migrating junctions of recombinant 0 X-G 4 figure- 8 s, previously located only {{with respect to the}} G 4 -Eco RI site, have now been located with high probabil-ity within the gene A region of the two genomes. The degree of mismatch between the known nucleotide sequences of 0 X and G 4 accounts for positions of all of the regions of single-strandedness in the observed heteroduplexes, but unexplained discrepancies were also found...|$|R
40|$|Three lactic streptococcal bacteriophages were {{compared}} with one another by electron microscopic analysis of heteroduplex DNA molecules. The phages were almost identical in morphology and had been isolated {{over a period of}} 10 years on different strains of Streptococcus cremoris from cheese plants situated in different parts of New Zealand. There was a high degree of homology between the DNAs, in agreement with Southern blot hybridization data reported earlier. There were, however, distinct regions of nonhomology, mostly between 0. 45 and 1. 71 kilobases in length, suggestive of the occurrence of block recombination events. A deletion of 2. 23 kilobases in the two more recently isolated phages, or an insertion in the first isolate, was found. All three phage DNAs showed differences in restriction endonuclease cleavage sites. Alignment of the restriction endonuclease <b>maps</b> with the <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>maps</b> showed that differences in cleavage sites occurred most frequently in regions of nonhomology. However, differences in cleavage sites in regions of apparent homology were also detected, indicating that point mutations may have occurred in addition to block recombination events...|$|R
40|$|The R factor NR 1 {{consists}} of two components: a resistance transfer factor which harbors the tetracycline resistance genes (RTF-TC) and the r-determinants component which harbors the other drug resistance genes. Using partial denaturation mapping {{it is possible to}} distinguish the RTF-TC region from the r-determinants region of the composite R factor NR 1 DNA which has a contour length of 37 mum and a density of 1. 712 g/ml. The r-determinants region was a relatively undenatured 8. 5 -mum segment of the molecule when the deoxyribonucleic acid was partially denatured at pH 10. 7. An RTF-TC genetic segregant of NR 1 which had lost the r-determinants component had a contour length of 28. 7 mum and a density of 1. 710 g/ml. Characterization of an RTF-TC using partial denaturation mapping at pH 10. 7 confirmed that the relatively undenatured 8. 5 -mum r-determinants segment of the composite R factor had been deleted. Circular, transitioned NR 1 DNA molecules (1. 716 to 1. 718 g/ml), whose contour lengths were consistent with an RTF-TC plus an integral number of tandem copies of r-determinants, were also characterized by denaturation mapping. The relatively undenatured region in these molecules had a length equal to an integral number of copies of r-determinants and was located at the same site in the partially denatured RTF-TC as the single copy of r-determinants in the 37 -mum composite NR 1. This indicates that there is a unique integration site for r-determinants in the RTF-TC component. The R factor UCR 122, a TC deletion mutant of NR 1, was also characterized by denaturation mapping. The translocation of the TC resistance gene(s) on the denaturation map permitted the alignment of the denaturation <b>map</b> with the <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>map</b> of Sharp et al. (u 073). Linear and circular monomeric and presumed multimeric r-determinants DNA molecules (p = 1. 718 g/ml) were partially denatured at a higher pH (11. 10). The r-determinants multimers showed a repeating 8. 3 -mum (monomeric) partial denaturation pattern indicating a head-to-tail arrangement of monomers in these poly-r-determinant molecules...|$|R
40|$|The Escherichia coli dnaZ gene, a {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} (DNA) {{polymerization}} gene, is located 1. 2 min counterclockwise from purE, at approximately min 10. 5 on the E. coli map. From a lysogen with lamdacI 857 integrated at a secondary attachment site near purE, transducing phages (lambdadnaS+) that transduced a dnaZts (lambda+) recipient to temperature insensitivity (TS+) were discovered. Three different plaque-forming transducing phages were isolated from seven primary heterogenotes. Genetic tests and <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>mapping</b> {{were used to}} determine the length and position of E. coli DNA within the lambda DNA. Complementation tests demonstrated that the deletions in all three strains removed both att P and the int gene, i,e., DNA from both prophage ends. <b>Heteroduplex</b> <b>mapping</b> confirmed this result by demonstrating that all three strains had deletions of lambda DNA that covered the b 2 to red region, thereby removing both prophage ends. Specifically, the deletions removed lambda DNA between the points 39. 3 to 66. 5 % of lambda length (measured in percent length from the left and of lambda phage DNA) in all three strains. The three strains are distinct, however, because they had differing lengths of host DNA insertions. These phages must have been formed by an anomalous procedure, because standard lambda transducing phages are deleted for one prophage end only. In lambdagal and lambdabio strains, the deletions of lambda DNA begin at the union of prophage ends (i. e., position 57. 3 % of lambda length) and extend leftward or rightward, respectively (Davidson and Szybalski, in A, D. Hershey [ed. ], The Bacteriophage Lambda, p. 45 - 82, 1971). Models for formation of the lambdadnaZ+ phages are discussed...|$|E

A stable hybrid phage was isolated and identified by its ability to complement the lac alpha function. Further characterization of the hybrid phage includes retransformation studies, agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA-DNA hybridization, and <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>mapping.</b> The insertion point has been localized at 0. 083 map unit on thewild-type circular map-i. e., within the intergenic region.

40|$|The distal {{half of the}} {{bacteriophage}} T 4 {{tail fiber}} interacts with {{the surface of the}} bacterium during adsorption. The largest polypeptide in this half fiber is the product of gene 37 (P 37). During assembly of the tail fiber, P 37 interacts with the product of gene 38 (P 38). These two gene products are incompatible with the corresponding gene products from the related phage T 2. T 2 P 37 does not interact with T 4 P 38 and T 2 P 38 does not interact with T 4 P 37. Crosses between T 2 and T 4 phages mutant in genes 37 and 38 have shown that the carboxyl end of P 37 interacts with P 38 and with the bacterial surface. In the corresponding region of gene 37 and in gene 38 there is no recombination between T 2 and T 4. In the rest of gene 37 there are two small regions with relatively high recombination and a region of low recombination. When T 2 /T 4 heteroduplex DNA molecules are examined in the electron microscope four nonhomologous loops appear in the region of genes 37 and 38. Heteroduplexes between hybrid phages which have part of gene 37 from T 4 and part from T 2 have roughly located gene 37 mutations in the heteroduplex pattern. For a more precise location of the, mutations a physical map of gene 37 was constructed by determining the molecular weights of amber polypeptide fragments on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. When the physical and <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>maps</b> are aligned, the regions of low recombination correspond to regions of nonhomology between T 2 and T 4. Regions with relatively high recombination are homologous. The molecular weight of T 2 P 37 is about 13, 000 greater than that of T 4 P 37. Analysis of hybrid phage has shown that this molecular weight difference is all at the carboxyl end of P 37. An antiserum has been prepared which is specific for the distal half fiber of T 4. Tests of the ability of gene 37 hybrids to block this antiserum show that there are at least 4 subclasses of antigen specified by different parts of P 37. Observations in the electron microscope of the tailfiber - anti- body complexes formed by the gene 37 hybrids and the specific anti- serum have shown that P 37 is oriented linearly in the distal half fiber with its N-terminus near the joint between the two half fibers and its C-terminus near the tip of the fiber. These observations lead to a simple model for the structure of the distal half fiber. The high recombination in T 4 gene 34 was also investigated. A comparison of genetic and physical maps of gene 34 showed that there is a gradient of increasing recombination near one end of the gene. ...|$|R
40|$|From an {{undiluted}} passaged virus stock, two {{size classes}} of defective simian virus 40 (SV 40) DNA were isolated from which two evolutionary variants were cloned. By means of restriction enzyme and <b>heteroduplex</b> analysis, physical <b>maps</b> of the mutants have been constructed. Both mutants contained the region of SV 40 DNA coding for the early proteins plus some adjacent sequences (the region from 0. 120 to 0. 685 map unit, clockwise, on the standard SV 40 DNA map). Furthermore, each mutant contained, {{in the form of}} two inverted repeats, four times the sequences from the region 0. 625 to 0. 685 map unit, clockwise. Some biological properties of the mutant DNA were examined, and we found that the mutant DNA (i) has, as compared with SV 40 DNA, an impaired ability to induce T antigen in permissive and nonpermissive cells; (ii) does not complement a thermosensitive A mutant of SV 40; (iii) replicates very inefficiently without a helper; and (iv), as an apparent contradiction, transforms nonpermissive baby rat kidney cells as well as SV 40 DNA.

When one of the spots was extracted and used as a probe for Southern blot analysis, two HindIII bands (11. 0 and 3. 6 kilobases [kb]) of the genomic digest hybridized with approximately equal intensity. The 3. 6 -kb fragment was cloned and found to contain {{two different types of}} repeated sequence. One type was approximately 1. 1 kb in length and was found at least twice in the entire genome. The other consisted of a 26 -base-pair family GT(C/A) C(Py) G(Pu) TTTTTGTTAAT(Py) C(Pu) CTATA (Py, pyrimidine; Pu, purine) that was repeated at least 20 times in the entire genome.

Under conditions normally employed for full DNA renaturation, these high order repeat chromosomes gave often incomplete renaturation over the repeated segments.

Studies presented elsewhere show that members of all three repeat sequence families are transcribed tissue-specifically. The thermal stability of intrafamilial heteroduplexes was measured, {{and the extent of}} colinearity between related sequences was determined by restriction <b>mapping,</b> <b>heteroduplex</b> visualization, gel blot hybridization, and direct sequencing. One large and very divergent family, named 2108, was shown to consist of an assemblage of many small repeat sequence subfamilies. Each subfamily includes < 40 members which are not contiguous in the genome but are very closely related colinear sequence elements several thousand nucleotides in length. The different 2108 subfamilies share only small sequence subelements, which in each subfamily occur in a different linear order and are surrounded by different sequences. A second divergent family consisting of short repetitive sequences, the 2109 family, includes many small internally homologous subfamilies as well. A third family, 2034, displays little internal sequence divergence and no apparent subfamily structure. The repeat sequence subfamilies may be biologically significant units of repetition. Thus specific 2108 subfamilies were shown to be evolutionary conserved to a remarkable degree.

Regions of nonhomology between the DMBA-LV genome and the MMTV genome were identified by <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>mapping</b> and nucleotide sequence studies. In the electron microscope <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>mapping</b> studies the EcoRI-generated 5 ' and 3 ' fragments of the DMBA-LV genome were compared with the corresponding fragments of the MMTV (C 3 H and GR) genome isolated from mammary tumors. The results indicated that DMBA-LV contained a region of nonhomologous nucleotide sequences in the 3 ' half of the U 3 region of the long terminal repeat (LTR). Nucleotide sequence studies confirmed these results and showed that in this region 440 nucleotides of the MMTV (C 3 H) sequences were deleted and substituted with a segment of 122 nucleotides. This substituted segment {{in the form of}} a tandem repeat structure contained nucleotide sequences derived exclusively from sequences which flanked the substitution loop. The distal glucocorticoid regulatory element was unaltered, and two additional copies of the distal glucocorticoid regulatory element-binding site were present in the substituted region. The restriction endonuclease map of the reconstructed molecular clone of DMBA-LV was identical to that corresponding to unintegrated linear DMBA-LV DNA present in DMBA-LV-induced tumor cell lines. Since the nucleotide sequences of the LTRs present in four different DMBA-LV proviral copies isolated from a single thymoma were identical, we concluded that they were derived from the same parental virus and that this type B retrovirus containing an alteration in the U 3 region of its LTR could induce thymic lymphomas. Thus, DMBA-LV represents the first example of a productively replicating type B retrovirus that contains an LTR modified in the U 3 region and that has target cell and disease specificity for T cells...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{two-dimensional}} S 1 nuclease <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>mapping</b> {{was developed to}} detect gene rearrangements and repeated sequences in total bacterial chromosomes. To detect DNA rearrangements between two variant bacterial strains, total chromosomal DNA preparations from the two strains are digested with four-base-recognizing restriction enzymes, mixed together, denatured, renatured, and separated on first-dimension polyacrylamide slab gels. Gel strips are cut out and soaked in a buffer containing S 1 nuclease, which diffuses into the strips and digests the DNA fragments at single-stranded regions. The digested DNA is then electrophoresed in a second dimension perpendicular to the first dimension. DNA heteroduplexes that were digested by the S 1 nuclease are resolved as distinct spots below a bright unresolved band of homoduplex.

These two hybrids, Ad 2 +ND 2 and Ad 2 +ND 4, contain 32 and 43 % of the SV 40 genome, respectively. The pattern of induction of SV 40 transplantation antigen (TSTA) by the various hybrids differentiates TSTA from both SV 40 U and T antigens. Since the SV 40 RNA induced by both these hybrids is early SV 40 RNA, these findings confirm that TSTA is an early SV 40 function. By combining available data on SV 40 antigen induction by these hybrids with electron microscopy <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>mapping</b> studies, the DNA segment responsible for the induction of SV 40 TSTA can be inferred to lie in the region between 0. 17 and 0. 43 SV 40 units from the site on the SV 40 chromosome cleaved by E. coli R 1 restriction endonuclease...|$|E

In addition, REV lacked the sequences {{corresponding to the}} env gene but contained, instead, a contiguous stretch (1. 6 to 1. 9 kilobases) of the specific sequences presumably related to viral oncogenicity. Unlike those of other avian acute leukemia viruses, the transformation-specific sequences of REV were not contiguous with the gag-pol deletion. Thus, REV has a genome structure {{similar to that of}} a defective mink cell focus-inducing virus or a defective murine sarcoma virus. An additional class of heteroduplex molecules containing the gag-pol deletion and two other smaller deletion loops was observed. These molecules probably represented recombinants between the oncogenic REV and its helper virus...|$|E
40|$|Wild-type and mutant {{double-stranded}} RNA (dsRNA) {{species from}} the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were studied by electron microscopic <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>mapping</b> {{to determine the}} sequence relationships among the different RNA molecules. Three mutant dsRNAs, 1. 5, 1. 4, and 0. 73 kilobase, {{were found to be}} derived by the same internal deletion of the wild-type (I 83 kilobases) molecule. This deletion includes a wild-type (1. 83 kilobases) molecule. This deletion includes a segment of about 200 base pairs that was estimated to be nearly 100 % A+U. In addition, the sequences of the two larger mutant RNA species are tandem, direct duplications. One of the duplicated molecules appears to have a second internal deletion that occurred after the duplication. The mutant dsRNAs are functionally similar to the defective interfering virus particles of animal viruses [...] all of the mutant species prevent the propagation of the wild-type dsRNA when both are present in the same cell. The four dsRNAs share the same sequences at their termini, a finding that may suggest that these sequences are important for the replication of the dsRNAs...|$|E
40|$|The {{mutations}} in X chromosome-linked diseases are frequently heterogeneous, and yet {{only a small}} fraction can be detected by Southern analysis. We therefore adapted the chemical cleavage method of Cotton et al. [Cotton, R. G. H., Rodrigues, N. R. & Campbell, R. D. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 4397 - 4401] and the polymerase chain reaction to rapidly scan for point {{mutations in}} X chromosome-linked ornithine transcarbamoylase (carbamoyl-phosphate: L-ornithine carbamoyltransferase, EC 2. 1. 3. 3.) deficiency. This simple <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>mapping</b> method identified different mismatch sites in polymerase chain reaction-amplified liver cDNA from five unrelated ornithine transcarbamoylase-deficient patients. The predicted sequence alteration was confirmed by DNA sequencing in all five patients and indicated a likely disease-causing mutation in four of these patients. In one atypical ornithine transcarbamoylase-deficient patient a sequence alteration compatible with a cDNA polymorphism was found. One family was studied in detail. Female-carrier detection was performed by chemical cleavage of amplified genomic DNA and verified by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. This mutation scanning approach is simple, sensitive, and applicable to many genetic loci...|$|E
40|$|The DNA {{sequence}} of a 354 basepair EcoRI-HindIII fragment of plasmid pMB 9 which has originally been derived from plasmid pSC 101 has been resolved. This fragment contains a promoter for transcription directed towards the EcoRI site. Escherichia coli RNA polymerase binds to a region within the EcoRI-HindIII fragment which contains the heptamer 5 ' TATGGTG (132 - 126) and the duodecamer 5 ' TGATGAACATCA (158 - 147). Based on commonalities with other promotors these DNA sequences probably function as, respectively, "binding site" and "recognition site". Furthermore, this fragment harbours a translation reading frame free of nonsense codons and at about 25 basepairs from the indicated heptamer a nucleotide sequence which meets {{with the requirements}} for initiation of translation. By <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>mapping</b> it was shown that the EcoRI-HindIII fragment has been derived from a region near or within the origin of replication of pSC 101. The copynumber of plasmids containing the EcoRI-HindIII fragment is two-fold {{lower than that of}} plasmids lacking this fragment. This effect might be related to the original function of this fragment on plasmid pSC 101...|$|E
40|$|Rasheed rat sarcoma virus (RaSV) {{has been}} shown to code for a protein of 29, 000 Mr not present in replication-competent rat type C helper virus (RaLV) -infected cells. This protein is a fused gene product {{consisting}} of a portion of the RaLV p 15 gag protein and the transformation-specific 21, 000 Mr (p 21) ras protein, which is also found in Harvey murine sarcoma virus. We now report the molecular cloning of both the SD- 1 (Sprague-Dawley) strain of RaLV and the transforming ras sequences of RaSV. Heteroduplex analysis of these cloned DNAs demonstrated that the RaSV ras gene (v-Ra-ras) was inserted into the rat type C viral genome with a small deletion of RaLV genetic information in the 5 ' region of the gag gene and that the v-Ra-ras gene (0. 72 kilobase pair) is homologous to and colinear with the p 21 ras gene of Harvey murine sarcoma virus (v-Ha-ras). Restriction enzyme mapping confirmed the homology demonstrated by <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>mapping,</b> showing strong site conservation of restriction endonucleases known to cleave v-Ha-ras. Cloned v-Ra-ras DNA transformed NIH 3 T 3 cells, inducing the synthesis of the p 29 RaSVgag-ras protein...|$|E
40|$|I. A {{phosphoglycerate kinase}} (PGK) {{deficient}} variant cell line, R 1. 1. 7, {{derived from the}} Chinese hamster ovary cell line, CHO-K 1, {{is used as a}} recipient {{in the development of a}} DNA-mediated transfection system designed for the study of in vivo expression of exogenous PGK gene sequences. II. Several PGK DNA sequences are detected in the Chinese hamster genome by hybridisation of genomic DNA digests with a human PGK cDNA probe. A number of these sequences are shown to be X-linked. Four of the PGK sequences observed in the blot hybridisations are isolated from a CHO-K 1 DNA genomic library and analysed by probing with different regions of the PGK cDNA, <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>mapping</b> and DNA sequencing. One of these sequences is a 572 bp exon from the functional X-linked PGK gene (PGK- 1) which is expressed in all somatic cells. The three remaining PGK sequences are intronless pseudogenes which were apparently derived independently, from an ancestral Chinese hamster PGK gene, within the last 50 million years. They exhibit features typical of 'processed' pseudogenes which are generated via an mRNA intermediate and integrated into breaks in the chromosomal DNA...|$|E
40|$|The {{relatedness}} {{of several}} double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA's) {{present in the}} virus-like particles of yeast was examined by T 1 fingerprint analysis. The dsRNA's examined were L, the dsRNA encoding the capsid polypeptide of yeast virus-like particles; M, which appears to code for a toxic polypeptide and for resistance {{to the effects of}} the toxin; and two S dsRNA's present in particles analogous to the defective interfering particles of animal viruses. S 3, a dsRNA of 0. 46 X 10 (6) daltons, was derived entirely from M, a dsRNA of 1. 2 X 10 (6) daltons. S 1, a dsRNA of 0. 92 X 10 (6) daltons, was a duplication of S 3. This conclusion has also been reached independently by <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>mapping</b> techniques (H. M. Fried and G. R. Fink, personal communication). S 1 and S 3, at least in one yeast strain, were unstable in sequence, apparently due to the accumulation of sequence variants of the same molecular weight. L was a species of 3 X 10 (6) daltons, unrelated in sequence to M, S 1, or S 3. S 1, S 3, and M had a 3 ' T 1 dodecanucleotide in common...|$|E
