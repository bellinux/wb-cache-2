40|$|The Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) {{provides}} an agriculture-led integrated framework of development priorities {{aimed at reducing}} poverty and increasing food security by achieving an average of 6 percent agricultural growth rate every year. Initial economic modeling results to support CAADP planning indicate that, while {{it is possible for}} many African countries to reach this target, it will require substantial additional growth across different agricultural sub-sectors and commodities, as well as substantial investments to stimulate the necessary acceleration in growth. In many cases, the agricultural investments required are in excess of the 10 percent of total <b>expenditures</b> <b>commitment</b> agreed on under the Maputo declaration. This is necessary because of the moderate and slowly growing agricultural productivity across the continent.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{performs}} three empirical {{exercises to}} determine the patterns and properties of fiscal flows and mechanisms in the Indian federation as they affect subnational state governments, who carry the major public expenditure responsibility for education and health. Statutory flows from national level to states, defined in both aggregate and distribution between states, were exceeded or equaled in magnitude by non-statutory Plan flows that were variable in aggregate quantum and degree of subordination to distribution by formula. The non-formulaic bargaining margin within these flows is quantified for each year of the period 1951 - 2007, and estimated to have varied inversely with an index of political fractionalization in the federation. This uncertainty in the predictability of annual transfers provided an unfavourable fiscal environment for enhancing steady <b>expenditure</b> <b>commitments</b> of the kind required for provision of primary education and health.

40|$|Economists {{generally}} {{believe that}} countercyclical fiscal policies have stabilizing effects that work through automatic stabilizers and discretionary actions. Analyses underlying this conventional wisdom focus on intratemporal margins: how employment and personal income respond {{in the short}} run to changes in government expenditures and taxes. But in economic downturns, countercyclical policies increase government indebtedness, raising future debt service obligations. These new <b>expenditure</b> <b>commitments</b> must be financed by some mix of higher taxes, lower spending, or higher money growth in the future. Expectations of how future policies will adjust change current savings rates and the efficacy of countercyclical policies. It is thus possible for responses to expected future policies to exacerbate and prolong recessions. This paper highlights these expectations effects. Connecting the theory to U. S. data we find: (1) through this expectations channel, countercyclical policies may create a business cycle when there would be no cycle in the absence of countercyclical policies; (2) nontrivial fractions of variation in investment and velocity can be explained by variation in macro policies alone [...] -without any nonpolicy sources of fluctuation; and (3) persistence in key macro variables can arise solely from expectations of policy. ...|$|E

The act sought to unify previously fragmented programs and create a more comprehensive workforce investment system by bringing together most federally funded employment and training services into a single service delivery system known as the one-stop center system. The administration has twice proposed reducing the program's budget, citing the large amounts of unexpended funds that states carried over from the prior year. State and local workforce officials, however, have requested more funding in light of current economic conditions. GAO found that the Department of Labor lacks accurate information on states' WIA spending because of reporting inconsistencies [...] all states do not report <b>expenditures</b> or <b>commitments</b> in the same way. To determine how states manage their spending, Labor has established its own spending benchmarks, using them to access whether states are on track with their spending, to target technical assistance, and to formulate budget requests. Several factors affect when expenditures occur or are reported.
