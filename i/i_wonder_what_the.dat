Nekesa Mumbi Moody from Associated Press deduced [...] "Twenty years after the first MTV Video Music Awards, and not much has changed — Madonna still makes jaws drop and cheeks blush." [...] Brian Hiatt from Entertainment Weekly felt that [...] "The close-up of [...] locking lips with the 21-year-old Spears was an indelible MTV moment — sexy, vaguely transgressive, and as meaningless as it was entertaining." [...] Elysa Gardner from USA Today explained that the performance [...] "offered a poignant reminder of MTV's role in defining a youth culture that {{has become something of a}} tease — winking at convention without offering any fresh alternatives." [...] The MTV producers were skeptical, saying that [...] "It was sensational, but <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> good folk in places like Provo, Utah state, would make of it. Middle America is not gonna let this one go lightly." [...] When asked about it, Madonna revealed, [...] "I am kissing [...] and passing my energy on to her. Like kind of a mythological fairytale." [...] The performance was listed by Blender magazine as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history. MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of the MTV Video Music Awards. In Madonna's 2004 Re-Invention World Tour, a remix interlude of [...] "Hollywood" [...] featured a breakdancer, a firedancer, a bellydancer, a tapdancer, and a skateboarder. The screens displayed animations of tarot cards. The performance was included in the I'm Going to Tell You a Secret live album and documentary. On the same tour, the performance of [...] "Into the Groove" [...] contained samples from the remix [...] "Into the Hollywood Groove".|$|E

I'm not advocating getting rid of helmets, I'm just saying <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> social effect of helmets has been." ...|$|E
2500|$|Consider some {{subtleties}} {{that people}} are not consciously aware of. The verb is may be used in its full form or its reduced form: people say Kim is happy or Kim’s happy. However, certain instances of is never reduce, for example, the underlined items in Kim is happier than Tim is or <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> problem is in Washington. Most people are not aware of this, but we all know subconsciously not to use the reduced form here. How did we come to this? The question arises because the eventual knowledge is richer than relevant experience. As children, we heard instances of the full form and the reduced form, but we were not instructed to avoid the reduced form in certain places; we had no access to [...] "negative data," [...] information about what does not occur.|$|E

6000|$|... "O yes," [...] said he, [...] "good enough,--but that gate put me out. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> {{matter with}} it. It's {{got to be}} fixed. I won't be bothered and worried in this way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I guess we'll have to.... Say, Father, {{this seems}} to be a fine, live, prosperous town. Say, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> chances for opening a drug-store here? Competition is getting pretty severe in Saserkopee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Upon my word, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Vicar {{will say}} to the use you make of his Sunday-school. Pretty work for his model teacher.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, true, I forgot that. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> redskin, as {{the guide}} calls him, is {{thinking}} about," [...] added Charley, in a musing tone.|$|E
6000|$|... "And pray, Corporal, {{who ever}} did?" [...] said Mrs. Cat, rather offended. [...] "A nasty, ugly slut! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> men {{can see in}} her?" ...|$|E
60|$|BURGE-LUBIN. Synthesis! This is an {{intellectual}} difficulty. This {{is a job}} for Confucius. I heard him use that very word the other day; and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> devil he meant. [Switching on] Hallo! Put me through to the Chief Secretary.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is he?" [...] exclaimed Toby, quickly. [...] "How {{funny that}} is! for I'm an awful eater. Why, Uncle Dan'l {{used to say}} that I ate twice as much as I ought to, an' it never made me any bigger. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> reason?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Saturday! Why, come to think, I {{did know}} it. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> matter with me lately? Certainly I knew it. Ain't we all {{getting ready for}} her? Well, I must be going now. But I'll be on hand when she comes, old man!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hello! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> deuce this is? Looks like an Indian girl," [...] said Clarke to himself. [...] "She rides well, whoever she may be." ...|$|E
60|$|No--it wasn't Waring. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> devil {{has become}} of that man. He was to spend to-day with us, and the day's most gone, now.|$|E
6000|$|... "Three {{hours or}} thereabouts," [...] I answered, [...] "but perhaps sooner. I'll take two prints off {{when it is}} ready. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Carrolls will say." ...|$|E
500|$|Romany King's jockey Adrian Maguire said: [...] "Going to <b>The</b> Chair, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> {{hell was}} going on because I saw a fellow {{wandering}} nonchalantly across the fence. There were two cones in front of it, but the horses still in the race all kept going." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{found three}} {{women in the}} little house. They were in a side kitchen eating their dinner, and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> bear would have done if he had smelled that dinner. They told me that I {{was not on the}} main road, and would have to go back more than half a mile in order to regain it.|$|R
60|$|I {{was deeply}} chagrined at the {{unexpected}} turn affairs had taken, and I felt decidedly uncomfortable as John Stumpy levelled the weapon at my head. I could readily {{see that the}} battle of words was at an end. Action was now the order of <b>the</b> day. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> fellow would do next; but I was not kept long in suspense.|$|R
6000|$|Afterward, when we {{knew the}} only result that the affair could have, she said, [...] "The girl has a {{powerful}} will. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> mother was like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'By Jove,' said Swift, {{when he had}} gone, 'what an unholy rag! This suits yours truly. Poor old Jim, though. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> deuce has {{happened}} to him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's all right,' he said. 'I've {{made them}} {{understand}} the trouble. They're bringing a ladder. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> time is? It must be about {{four in the}} morning.' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> {{subject of}} the picture was, but waited an {{opportunity}} to approach the speaker, while, as I did so, a young man said: [...] "I should rather like to take up your sister's challenge. Pulling the big catboat across here inside an hour without an air of wind was not exactly play; but {{can you tell us}} anything more about these tireless Westerners, Miss Lucille?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Peggy,' he said, 'you're {{more than}} a mascot. You ought to be drawing a big {{commission}} on everything I write. It beats me how any of these other fellows ever write anything without you there to help them. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> most expensive cigar they keep here? I must have it, whatever it is. Noblesse oblige. We popular playwrights mustn't be seen in public smoking any cheap stuff.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Barry Lynch's!" [...] re-echoed Martin; [...] "the divil you are! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what's</b> in <b>the</b> wind {{with him}} now. I thought Blake always did his business?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not {{thinking}} of Mary," [...] said Dr. Spencer, [...] "but of the wretched beings you are leaving shut up there. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> mercury would be there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fancy {{they have}} all bolted, Dick," [...] his comrade said; [...] "after the first five minutes we have not heard a sound. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> prahus are doing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's too bad; {{and just}} as we thought our fifteen or sixteen {{thousand}} dollars of the amount was safe. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> bank people at home will say now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> Blacky <b>the</b> Crow and his {{aunts and}} his uncles and his cousins are {{making such a}} fuss about," [...] said Peter Rabbit.|$|R
5000|$|... "When {{songs from}} Lisa Marie Presley {{showed up at}} my door, I was curious. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> {{daughter}} of an American revolutionary music artist had to say. What I heard was honest, raw, unaffected and soulful. I thought her father {{would be proud of}} her. The more I listened to the songs, the deeper an artist I found her to be. Listening beyond the media static, Lisa Marie Presley is a Southern American folk music artist of great value," [...] said Burnett.|$|R
5000|$|At the 1974 FIFA World Cup, Zaire {{were placed}} in Group 2 along with Scotland, Yugoslavia (home of Zaire coach and 1970 Morocco coach Blagoja Vidinić), and Brazil. In their first match against Scotland, they {{impressed}} with their fast attacking style, and lost just 0-2. Scottish centre-half Jim Holton said after the match [...] "Let's face it, we underestimated them.

6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} will go," [...] said my father. [...] "Poor girl, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> cause can be. She {{used to be}} so free from {{everything}} of the kind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes indeed! I'm {{eager to}} get into the mountains. Every night as I see the sun go down over them <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> world is like up there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Everything. Babies, Diphtheria, Mrs. Bent and The Dancing Master, I {{whooping}} in a chair, and The Dowd {{dropping in}} from the clouds. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> motive was all the motives.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, {{but come}} and see me often. I get so blue some days <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> use of it all. There's one fatal {{condition}} about this ranger business--it's a solitary job, it cuts out marriage for most of us. Many of the stations are fifteen or twenty miles from a post-office; then, too, the lines of promotion are few. I guess I'll have to get out, although I like the work. Come in any time and take a snack with me." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{went to the}} old Orso's apartments, {{and found}} {{everything}} quiet; I lay down on a couch outside the doors and tried to sleep; but my thoughts troubled me. My mind was with the sad horsemen galloping through <b>the</b> night, and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> morrow had in store for them and me. I knew a price would be set upon my head, and I had to remain here {{in the midst of}} my enemies as the only protection of an old man of eighty-five.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you?" [...] said Leonard, [...] "then I envy you, that is all. Here comes old Soa, and Otter after her. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> is <b>the</b> matter now. Something disagreeable, I suppose." ...|$|R
