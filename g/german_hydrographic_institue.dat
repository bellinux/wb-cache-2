40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} {{combination}} of nu-merical modeling and data analysis {{to gain a better understanding}} of the major characteristics of the circu-lation in the East Frisian Wadden Sea. In particular, we concentrate on the asymmetry of the tidal wave and its modulation in the coastal area, which results in a com-plex pattern of responses to the sea-level forcing from the North Sea. The numerical simulations are based on the 3 -D primitive equation General Estuarine Transport Model (GETM) with a horizontal resolution of 200 m and terrain-following vertical coordinates.

40|$|During {{the period}} in question, large ice drifts transported incalculable numbers of icebergs, ice fields and ice floes from the Antarctica into the South Atlantic, confronting long-journeying sailing ships on the Cape Horn route with {{considerable}} danger. As is still the case today, the ice drifts generally tended in a northeasterly direction. Thus it can be assumed that the ice masses occuring near Cape Horn and in the South Atlantic originated in Graham Land and the South Shetland Islands, while {{those found in the}} Pacific will have come from Victoria Land. The masses drifting to Cape Horn, Isla de los Estados, the Falkland Islands and occasionally as far as the Tristan da Cunha Group are transported by the West Wind Drift and Falkland Current, diverted by the Brazil Current. The Bouvet and Agulhas Currents have little influence here. The great ice masses repeatedly reached points beyond the "outermost drift ice boundery" calculated {{in the course of the}} years, to continue on in the direction of the equator. The number of sailing ships which fell victim to the ice drifts while rounding Cape Horn can only be surmised; they simply disappeared without a trace in the expanses of the South Atlantic. Until the end of the 1900 s the dangers presented by ice were less serious for westward-bound ships than for the "homeward-bounders" travelling from West to East. Following the turn of the century, however, the risk for "onwardbounders" increased significantly. Whether the ice drifts actually grew in might or whether the more frequent and more detailed reports led to this impression, could never be ascertained by the German Hydrographie Office. In the forty-one years between 1868 and 1908, ten light, ten medium and nine heavy ice years were counted, and only twelve years in which no reports of ice were submitted to the German Hydrographie Office. "One of the most terrible dangers threatening ships on their return from the Pacific Ocean," the pilot book for the Atlantic Ocean warns, "is the encounter with ice, to be expected south of the 50 th parallel (approx.) in the Pacific and south of the 40 th parallel (approx.) in the South Atlantic. " Following the ice drift of 1854 - 55, thought to be the first ever recorded, the increasing numbers of sailing ships rounding Cape Horn were frequently confronted with drifts of varying sizes or with single icebergs. Then from 1892 - 94, a colossal ice drift crossed the path of the sailships in three stages. Several sailing ships collided with the icebergs and could be counted lucky if they survived with heavy damage to the bow and the fo regear. The reports on those which vanished for ever in the ice masses are hardly of investigative value. The English suffered particularly badly in the ice-plagued waters; their captains apparently sailed courses that led more freqently through drifts than did the sailing instructions of the <b>German</b> <b>Hydrographic</b> Office. Thus, among others, Capt. Jarvis' DUNTRUNE, also the STANMORE, ARTHURSTONE and LORD RANOCH as well as the French GALATHEE and CASHMERE all collided with icebergs. The crew of the AETHELBERTH panicked after a collision and took to their lifeboats. It was only after the ship detached itself from the iceberg it had rammed that the men returned to it and continued their journey. The TEMPLEMORE, on the other hand, had to be abandoned for good. Of the German sailing ships, the FLOTOW is to be mentioned here, and in the third phase of the drift the American SAN JOAQUIN lost a large proportion of its rigging. In the 20 th century ice drifts continued to cross the courses of the Cape Horn ships. 1906 and 1908 were recorded as particularly heavy ice years. In 1908 - 09 both the FALKLANDBANK and the TOXTETH fell prey to ice, or so it was assumed during the subsequent Maritime Board proceedings. For the most part the German sailing ships were spared greater damages by sea. Their captains sent detailed ice reports to the <b>German</b> <b>Hydrographic</b> Office, which gratefully welcomed the information and partially incorporated it in the third and final edition of the "Pilot Book for the Atlantic Ocean. " From the end of 1926 until the beginning of 1928, the last of the large sailing ships were once again confronted with "tremendous masses of icebergs and ice drifts. " Reports of this period originated above all on the P-Liners PADUA, PAMIR, PASSAT, PEKING, PINNAS, PRIWALL and the ships of Gustav Erikson's fleet. The fate of the training sailship ADMIRAL KARPFANGER in connection with the ice in early 1938 was never clearly determined by the Maritime Board proceedings. Collision with an iceberg, however, is thought to be the most likely cause of accident. Today freight sailing ships no longer cross the oceans. The Cape Horn route is relatively insignificant for engine-powered ships and icebergs can be spotted in plenty of time by modern navigation technology [...] . The large ice drifts are no longer a menace, but only a marginal note in the final chapter of the history of transoceanic sailing...|$|R
40|$|Quality of the {{forecast}} {{provided by the}} <b>German</b> Maritime and <b>Hydrographic</b> Agency (BSH) for the North and Baltic Seas had been previously improved by assimilating satellite sea surface temperature SST (project DeMarine, Losa et al., 2012). We investigate possible further improvements using in situ observational temperature and salinity data: Marnet time series and CTD and ScanFish measurements. To assimilate the data, we implement the Singular Evolutive Interpolated Kalman (SEIK) filter (Pham et al., 1998). The SIEK analysis is performed locally (Nerger et al. 2006) accounting for/assimilating the data within a certain radius. In order to determine suitable localisation conditions for Marnet data assimilation, the BSHcmod error statistics have been analysed based on LSEIK filtering every 12 hours over a one year period (September 2007 – October 2008) given a 12 -hourly composites of NOAA’s SST and under the experiment conditions corresponding the maximum entropy. The principle of Maximum Entropy is also used as an additional criterion of plausibility of the augmented system performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{operational}} ocean {{prediction model}} for the North and Baltic Seas of the <b>German</b> Maritime and <b>Hydrographic</b> Agency (BSH) is augmented with a multivariate data assimilation (DA) system. We report on the implementation and performance of the scheme {{which is based on}} ensemble forecasting. Here we apply the localised Singular Evolutive Interpolated Kalman (SEIK) filter for assimilating the NOAA AVHRR-derived sea surface temperature (SST) data. Results are presented for two periods: October 2007 is used for calibration and March 2011 for the analysis of the performance in a pre-operational phase. The major forecast improvement is found to be a reduction in the local temperature bias. As compared with the regular BSH forecast without assimilation, the root mean square difference between the predicted SST and satellite observations is reduced on average from 0. 87 degC to 0. 53 degC for March 2011. The quality of the predicted fields that were not assimilated (velocities, sea level and salinity) is preserved as is confirmed by independent data. The results have required adjustment of the conditional data error statistics. The experiments conducted with different timing and frequency of data assimilation and variable forecasting periods show that the DA system corrects systematic model uncertainties and, due to memory to the corrections, improves prediction over periods of up to 5 days. The results also explicitly illustrate a lower quality of the AVHRR daytime product and reveal low informative influence of the data on the forecasting system when daytime SSYs are assimilated additionally to midnight observations...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{this thesis}} is the {{development}} of an operationally applicable method to derive the topography of the German Tidal Flat Area (Wadden Sea) by evaluation of satellite image using the so-called waterline method. Accurate and up-to-date topographic maps of the tidal flatsare an important basis for the protection of theWadden Sea as well as for coastal preservation. Due to the high variability of the topography in this area causedby storms and tidal currents conventionally generated maps (e. g. by echo sounding) often do not represent the actual terrain. The waterline method provides an additional approach. Here, a series of satellite images of the German Bight taken at different water levels are analysed to detect theborderline between tidal flats and adjacent water areas. After geo-coding, those waterlines are combined with the corresponding water levels to represent the topography on an irregularly spaced grid. Interpolation of these data yields a topographic mapof the intertidal zone. In this thesis the waterline method is used to map the wadden areas of Nordfriesland and Cuxhaven. The study is based on the analysis of 71 images taken by the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) aboard the European Remote Sensing Satellite ERS- 2 in the period from 1996 to 1999. Using a wavelet-based edge detection algorithm a largely automated estimation of the waterline is possible in spite of the high level of multiplicative noise in the SAR images. The developed procedure reduces the amount of work for an human operator considerably. A modified pass point correction is used for the geo-coding of the derived waterlines. Water levels obtained by the water level modell ofthe <b>German</b> Maritime and <b>Hydrographic</b> Agency(BSH) are assigned to the geo-coded waterlines. The resulting grid of topographic points is interpolated into a topographic map ofthe intertidal area {{for each of the four}} years using the software package TASH developed at the University of Hannover, Germany...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of marine and meteorological parameters {{is an important}} task for operational oceanographic services. Remote sensing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from TerraSAR-X/Tandem-X satellites {{have been used for}} validation and verification of new developed coastal forecast models. In comparison to in-situ buoy measurements at a single location allows remote sensing to cover large areas and to estimate the spatial distribution of investigated characteristics. Methods to derive wind speed and sea state using simple empirical models from high-resolution SAR data have been developed by DLR especially for coastal applications: a new nonlinear wind algorithm XMOD- 2 and new empirical model function XWAVE- 2 for obtaining significant wave height from X-band data. Both algorithms are capable of taking into account finescale effects in coastal areas. In order to improve forecast accuracy in coastal area a new high-resolution Coastal Wave Model (CWAM) for the German Bight and the western Baltic Sea has been developed by the German Meteorological Service (DWD) and the <b>German</b> Maritime and <b>Hydrographic</b> Agency (BSH) with resolution of 900 m and more accurate mapping of coastlines (1) and coupled to a irculation model (2). Uncertainties are present when dealing in coastal areas: wind input implying well-timed atmospheric front propagation and physical interaction-processes in shallow water caused by interplay between waves, currents and bottom become important. Due to currents and bottom influence the waves refract, dump, become steeper and break. The lost wave energy dissipates and transfers into turbulence and acceleration of flow currents (radiation stress). Sea state estimated from series of TerraSAR-X images cover strips with length of 200 km and width of 30 km over German Bight from East-Frisian Islands to Danish coast. The acquired data with more than 50 images were used for model validations. The comparisons show a number of local variations due to variety in bathymetry and wind fronts...|$|R
40|$|Within the DeMarine-Environment project [...] - {{as a part}} of the European Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) initiative, [...] - a data {{assimilation}} (DA) {{system has}} been developed for the operational circulation model of the <b>German</b> Maritime and <b>Hydrographic</b> Agency(BSH). In order to improve forecast of hydrographic characteristics in the North and Baltic Seas, Singular Evolutive Interpolated Kalman (SEIK) filter algorithm has been locally implemented for assimilating the NOAA AVHRR-derived sea surface temperature (SST). The degree of the forecast quality improvement depends on the assumption about model and data error statistics. ~ 27 % of forecast error reduction has been achieved for SST forecast over the period of October 2007 - September 2008 under best-tuned assumptions on standard SST data error of 0. 8 oC and exponential correlation function within radius of 100 km. Pilot real-time data assimilative pre-operational runs manifest much higher quality of the SST forecast in March 2011 in comparison with the regular BSH forecast without DA. On average, over that period, the root mean square (RMS) error has been decreased from 0. 8 oC to 0. 5 oC. The experiments conducted with different timing and frequency of data assimilation and variable forecasting periods show that the data assimilation system enables one to correct the systematic model uncertainties and, due to memory on the corrections, better predict over periods of up to 5 days. Our results also apparently illustrate the bias in AVHRR daytime product, but, however, reveal low informative influence of the data on the forecasting system when daytime SSTs are assimilated additionally to 'midnight' observations. To this end, it is worth noting that despite the high dependency of forecast quality improvement on the assumption about model uncertainties and data errors, statistics of which are not always, if ever, known a priori, the combination of the information from two different sources- the model and the data,- provided by data assimilation, might itself improve our understanding of both these sources and help to optimize the system...|$|R
