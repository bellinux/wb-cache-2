5|$|In 1960, Stafford {{said there}} were good and bad points to working closely with Weston. His {{knowledge}} of her {{made it easy for}} him to arrange her music, but sometimes it caused difficulties. Weston knew Stafford's abilities and would write or arrange elaborate music because he knew she was capable of performing it. She also said she did not believe she could perform in Broadway musicals because she thought <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> not powerful enough for stage work. In 2003, she recalled that there was often limited rehearsal time before she recorded a song, and how Weston would sometimes slip musical arrangements under the bathroom door as she was in the bath {{getting ready to go to}} the studio.|$|E
5|$|Persephone– The former Queen of the Underworld {{and main}} {{antagonist}} of Chains of Olympus. Bitter at being abandoned to the Underworld by her fellow gods, Persephone entered into {{an alliance with}} Morpheus and then freed and used the Titan Atlas to capture the god Helios, intending to use Helios' power to destroy the Pillar of the World. Persephone offered to reunite Kratos with his daughter Calliope in the Fields of Elysium. This she did, but Kratos reluctantly abandoned Calliope and killed Persephone to stop her from destroying the Pillar, which would have in turn destroyed the Fields of Elysium and Calliope with it. In God of War III, Persephone's remains were seen in a tree casket in Hades' palace and <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> heard in Kratos' psyche. The character was voiced by Marina Gordon in Chains of Olympus.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a spoiled, materialistic princess, the writers eventually re-wrote Jasmine into a stronger and more prominent heroine following the elimination of Aladdin's mother from the script, while borrowing story elements from the romantic comedy Roman Holiday (1953). Several months after securing the role, Larkin was nearly fired from the project because Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg felt that <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> not suitable for a princess, but Clements and Musker managed to convince him otherwise. Discovered by casting director Albert Tavares, Salonga was cast as Jasmine's singing voice based on her performance in the musical Miss Saigon; this unprecedented casting decision made Jasmine the first Disney character to have her speaking and singing voices provided by two different actors. Animated by Mark Henn, Jasmine's design is an eclectic combination of unique sources, including an anonymous theme park guest, Henn's own sister, and actress Jennifer Connelly, while elements of the Taj Mahal were incorporated into the character's hair, clothing and physique.|$|E

5|$|She {{was born}} in Paris and moved with her family to Washington, D.C., in 1966. As a child, Smith was often teased because of her voice. She became a {{professional}} actress in 1982 after graduating from drama school and moved to New York City in 1984, where she appeared in the Broadway production of Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing. She made her film debut in 1985's Heaven Help Us, followed by roles in The Legend of Billie Jean and Maximum Overdrive. She moved to Los Angeles in 1986 and received a recurring role in the television series Brothers. In 1987, she auditioned for a role {{in a series of}} animated shorts about the Simpson family on The Tracey Ullman Show. Smith intended to audition for the role of Bart Simpson, but the casting director felt <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> too high, so she was assigned the role of Lisa, instead. She voiced Lisa for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, and in 1989, the shorts were spun off into their own half-hour show, The Simpsons. For her work as the character, Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992.|$|E

25|$|It is very {{difficult}} to speak of the voice of Callas. <b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> a very special instrument. Something happens sometimes with string instruments—violin, viola, cello—where the first moment you listen to the sound of this instrument, the first feeling is a bit strange sometimes. But after just a few minutes, when you get used to, when you become friends with this kind of sound, then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.|$|E

Following the advice of the doctor, she took a year off and to keep herself occupied, she attended art lessons with her cousin. After a year, she started performing again despite the change in her vocal range, which lowered her voice by an octave (eight keys).|$|E
25|$|According to Decca Records {{producer}} Owen Bradley, the Four Star compositions only {{hinted at}} Patsy's potential. Bradley thought that <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> best-suited for pop music, but Cline sided with Peer {{and the other}} Four Star producers, insisting that she could only record country songs, as her contract also stated. Every time Bradley {{tried to get her}} to sing the torch songs that would become her signature, she would panic, missing her familiar country fiddle and steel guitar. She often rebelled, only wishing to sing country and yodel. She recorded 51 songs with Four Star.|$|E
25|$|Though {{she never}} learned to read notes, she had a great natural talent and could quickly learn her part in a song simply by having heard it once. <b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> {{described}} {{as that of a}} nightingale, and when Jeanette Wässelius, successor of Caroline Halle-Müller, retired in 1820, Henriette replaced her as Sweden's first prima donna, in competition with Elisabeth Frösslind and Anna Sofia Sevelin. Her salary reflected her position. She was paid 1.600; as comparison, the male actor with the highest salary was paid 1.800, and the lowest salary for an actress was 200.|$|E

25|$|Although {{best known}} for her Wagnerian interpretations, Lawrence played in a range of other works, {{including}} Salome and Georges Bizet's Carmen. She made a number of excellent recordings, mainly of works by Wagner. She received many good reviews throughout her career. She had a solid career in France, Mexico, Australia and throughout South America, as well as the US. However, she was unable to build a substantial career {{in other parts of the}} world due to World War II, when <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> prime.

25|$|Although {{she knew}} <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> good {{and she liked}} the attention, {{becoming}} an actress was her main objective. That desire was made stronger when she saw her first Broadway play, The Diary of Anne Frank, when she was fourteen. The star in the play was Susan Strasberg, whose acting she wanted to emulate if ever given the chance. To help achieve that goal, Streisand began spending her spare time in the library, studying the biographies of various stage actresses such as Eleanora Duse and Sarah Bernhardt. In addition, she began reading novels and plays, including some by Shakespeare and Ibsen, and also on her own, studied the acting theories of Konstantin Stanislavski and Michael Chekhov.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, she {{was cast}} as a leading lady and gun moll in the iconic crime film Get Carter, {{opposite}} Michael Caine, which firmly established her as a blonde bombshell. The 1970s also saw Ekland in several horror films, including What the Peeper Saw (1972) as a disturbed bride; the Agatha Christie adaptation Endless Night (1972), playing the friend and companion of an American heiress; and as a hallucinatory figure in the anthology film Asylum (1972) opposite Charlotte Rampling. Her most iconic horror role came in the 1973 cult horror film The Wicker Man, in which she played a Pagan villager and seductress; however, <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> dubbed in the film to disguise her Swedish-accented English.|$|E
