2500|$|In 1994, Joe Little {{was due to}} co-present an {{edition of}} the {{programme}} from the RTÉ studio in Castlebar, County Mayo, during the European Parliament election of that year, when it was realised belatedly {{that it could not}} be heard in Dublin. Disaster was prevented by mere minutes. When the IRA announced its cease-fire that same year, Joe Little was in the Belfast studio beginning an interview with the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, when the sound broke down live on air on a temporary basis. During one edition, the entire programme did malfunction, and, with interviews suspended and a commercial break impossible, Hanly intervened to prevent a complete disaster for several minutes by commenting to the show's previous guest: [...] "There was one other question <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> [...] ". Joe Little interviewed Lady Valerie Goulding to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of The Blitz of London by Germany.|$|E

I was glad when you spoke to me because {{this is exactly what}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> if you ever meet Captain Anthony--by any chance--anywhere--you are a sailor too, are you not?--that you, would never mention--never--that--that you had seen me over there." ...|$|E
60|$|COKESON. But we don't {{want to be}} unreasonable. He's quite downhearted. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to let him {{run about}} with the others.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where is Jonathan?" [...] Helen asked presently. [...] "Something {{happened}} at Metzar's yesterday. Papa wouldn't tell me, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Jonathan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jimmy, I've been {{thinking}} it over. There's something <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you. Do you {{admit that you}} behaved abominably five years ago?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I--er--no, thank you. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you a question. What is your candid {{opinion of}} those verses Mr Wells was reading just now?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Jenney said {{something}} else that--that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> about," [...] she went on, breathing more deeply. [...] "It {{was about the}} railroad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{been working}} here {{nearly two years}} now under you. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to tell me frankly {{if you think it}} worth while for me to continue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No? You {{are busy}} as ever? <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> about Lee. I {{was sorry to}} hear that there was a rumour that {{something}} was amiss with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{a little}} favor <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> of you, Ormesby, but I suppose {{you are all}} in one another's confidence?" [...] said Boone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, very well," [...] {{said the}} deep voice indifferently. [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> was, if {{anything}} had been heard of Fanny Robin?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for Captain Houghton,' said Alice, glad to {{lead the}} {{conversation}} away from revelations of which she had an instinctive dread.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{answered}} {{your question}} just now," [...] said the girl, very quietly, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one. Do you believe my uncle’s {{story about the}} buried treasure?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{wonder why}} I begged you to come. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something. You said I was ignorant. That is true. And what can I do but ask you?" ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Frederick, {{although}} I've been in {{the service}} I have rather a good head for business, and I hate beating about the bush. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to marry me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am a man}} again," [...] Julian declared. [...] "Come along {{round to}} Westminster. There are many things <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> about the Executive." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No; I'm {{going down}} home pretty early, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> your mother {{what is the}} best way to put away my winter things." ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl nodded shortly. [...] "It's not my business," [...] she said. [...] "I am {{glad you}} came. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something. Who {{is this man}} Rowan who killed my uncle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; it {{also seems}} to me enough. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> another word about poor Mr. Touchett," [...] Madame Merle added. [...] "Have you {{reason to believe that}} he's really at his last?" ...|$|E
60|$|COKESON. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> He's had his lesson. Now we {{know all}} about him, and we want a clerk. There is a young fellow applying, but I'm keeping him in the air.|$|E
5000|$|Girl, girl, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> of you What can grow, grow without rain? What {{can burn}} and never end? What can yearn, cry without tears? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Robert, dear," [...] she whispered, stooping over him, [...] "there was {{something}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> but papa {{was always in}} the way. You will do something to please me, won't you, Robert?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] she admitted, hesitatingly. [...] "You don't {{seem to me}} {{as though}} you cared to make friends very easily. I just felt <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> Have you ever been engaged?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some time <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{your advice}} {{about a little}} matter, Mr. Tracy. You see, I've got that young lord's remaims--my goodness, how you jump!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But for all that," [...] {{continued}} the lawyer, [...] "there's one point <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> ask: <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{the name of}} that man who walked over the child." ...|$|R

6000|$|MURRAY (glumly). I'm not. You can't call it writing--not what I did--small town stuff. (Changing the subject.) But <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something. Do {{you know}} when I'm to be moved away to the huts? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I didn't believe I {{should ever}} see you again," [...] the girl broke out impulsively upon Verrian. [...] "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> so about Miss Shirley. Have you seen her since you got back?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, honest, straight, tell me. I've got {{a chance}} to travel. What d'yuh think of that? Ain't it great! And I'm going right away. What <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> was, what's the best place in Ireland to see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you mean," [...] she replied, quickly. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you--could father be of any help if I telegraphed him to come?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you about, Harney. Isn't {{there some}} place around here {{where we might}} hide the prisoners? A cave, or {{something}} like that?" ...|$|R
