According to cognitive psychology, brand equity lies in consumer’s awareness of brand features and associations, which drive attribute perceptions. According to information economics, a strong brand name works as a credible signal of product quality for imperfectly informed buyers and generates price premiums as a form of return to branding investments. It has been empirically demonstrated that brand equity {{plays an important role in}} the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> structure and, in particular, firms are able to charge price premiums that derive from brand equity after controlling for observed product differentiation.|$|E

40|$|In the 1970 s, the Sraffian {{interpretation}} of Marx’s theory, {{as represented by}} the works of Meek, Dobb, Morishima, Steedman, etc. came to be the dominant, most widely accepted interpretation. By the Sraffian interpretation, I mean primarily that: (1) the fundamental givens in Marx’s theory {{are assumed to be}} the physical quantities of the technical coefficients of production and the real wage and (2) the rate of profit is determined simultaneously with <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> production and both are derived from the above physical quantities. In other words, Marx’s theory is interpreted as essentially the same as Sraffa’s linear production theory. It is well known that this interpretation leads to the following damaging criticisms of Marx’s theory <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> production: (1) Marx’s <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> production is logically inconsistent because Marx failed to transform the inputs of constant capital and variable capital. (2) Marx’s error can be corrected, using a method first suggested by Bortkiewitz, but this correction implies that Marx’s two aggregate equalities (aggregate price = aggregate value and aggregate profit = aggregate surplus-value) cannot both be true simultaneously. (3) This correction also implies that the rate of profit changes in the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> production, so that the <b>price</b> rate <b>of</b> profit is in general not equal to the value rate of profit.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of {{long-term}} unemployment in the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> and wages. Labor market theories such as insider-outsider models predict {{that this type of}} unemployed are less relevant in the wage formation process than the newly unemployed. This paper looks for evidence of this behavior in a set of OECD countries. For this purpose, I propose a new specification of the Phillips Curve that contains different unemployment lengths in a time-varying NAIRU setting. This is done by constructing an index of unemployment that assigns different weights to the unemployed based on the length of their spell. The results show that unemployment duration matters in the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> and wages, and that a smaller weight ought to be given to the long-term unemployed. This modified model has important implications for the policy maker: It produces more accurate forecasts of inflation and more precise estimates of the NAIRU.

The general assumption is that the deterioration starts from the instant of arrival in stock may cause retailers to make inappropriate replenishment policies due to overvalue the total annual relevant inventory cost. Therefore, it is inevitable in the field of inventory management to consider the inventory problems for instantaneous deteriorating items. The coordination of price decisions and inventory control is thus not only useful but also significant {{because of the fact that}} the replenishment policy without considering the selling price cannot optimize the revenue and the simultaneous <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> and ordering production quantity can yield substantial revenue increase.|$|E

40|$|In the {{discussion}} on the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> under socialism the basic attention of its participants normally is concentrated on defining the principles <b>of</b> determining <b>prices</b> which most completely {{take into account the}} demands of the law of value. But some economists ignore, in our opinion, two rather important circumstances. First, the law of value under socialism does not operate in isolation, but in the system of economic laws of socialist society. If one considers that under capitalism the law of value is modified according to the basic law of that order, into the law <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> production, and then at the stage of imperialism into the law <b>of</b> monopoly <b>prices,</b> so much more is its modification unavoidable under conditions of socialism when it ceases to be the regulator of production and is subjected to the operation of the basic economic law of socialism and the law of planned, proportional development of the national economy. Secondly, all the participants of discussion admit that under socialism price is the money expression of the value of commodities. Nevertheless, when studying the operation of the law of value in the process <b>of</b> the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices,</b> the role <b>of</b> money is often ignored. ...|$|R

Considering that the literature on this topic is sometimes diffused, this paper presents in a unified way the solutions advanced following a mathematical treatment and presentation. Special emphasis is paid to a new normalization procedure that emphasize on the role of the labor theory value as a theory of value formation rather than price. In this tradition, prices will tend to assign or distribute value across society.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate {{the application of the}} common law rule prohibiting unilateral price determination in contracts of sale governed by the Consumer Protection Act. The unilateral <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> has been a controversial issue {{for an extended period of}} time. This controversy is traced back to Roman law where different translations and interpretations are given to the texts dealing with the unilateral <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> in a contract of sale. The majority of the Roman-Dutch writers preferred the view that regarded a contract granting a discretion to one of the parties to determine the price as void. Subsequently, this view was incorporated into South African law. During the 1990 s the Supreme Court of Appeal questioned whether the rule should still form part of South African law. An overview of the case law indicates that the courts have been prepared to allow contractual price discretions provided such discretions refer to an objective external standard or reasonableness. There are also indications that the courts would imply that the discretion should be exercised reasonably, except in the case of clearly unfettered discretions. Recently, the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 ("the CPA") has made substantial amendments to the law of sale in respect of contracts governed by the CPA. The dissertation investigates the influence of the CPA on the rule governing unilateral price determinations in such sales. It also investigates the consumer's fundamental rights to disclosure of information and fair, just and reasonable terms and conditions. Legal uncertainties and issues arising from the provisions of the CPA are identified. Finally, a comparative study with English law is undertaken which provides a comparative basis from which possible solutions are extracted and proposals made to address the uncertainties and issues emanating from the CPA.
