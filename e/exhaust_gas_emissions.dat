50|$|The {{software}} {{is based on}} the stochastic reactor model (SRM), which is stated in terms of a weighted stochastic particle ensemble. SRM is particular useful in the context of engine modelling as the dynamics of the particle ensemble includes detailed chemical kinetics whilst accounting for inhomogeneity in composition and temperature space arising from on-going fuel injection, heat transfer and turbulence mixing events. Through this coupling, heat release profiles and in particular the associated <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> (Particulates, NOx, Carbon monoxide, Unburned hydrocarbon etc.) can be predicted more accurately than if using the more conventional approaches of standard homogenous and multi-zone reactor methods.|$|E
50|$|The only {{moving parts}} inside simple {{two-stroke}} engines are the crankshaft, the connecting rod, and the piston. It {{is the same}} simplicity in design, however, that causes a two-stroke engine to be less fuel-efficient and produce high specific levels of undesirable <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions.</b> At {{the bottom of the}} power stroke, the transfer ports, which deliver fresh fuel, are open {{at the same time as}} the exhaust port. This can allow a significant amount of fresh fuel to run straight through the engine without ever being available for power production. Properly designed exhaust systems help minimize the amount of raw fuel loss in the exhaust process, but a two-stroke engine will always waste some fuel (modern direct injected engines being an exception to this).|$|E
5000|$|Compression Ignition Direct Injection (CIDI) {{combustion}} is {{a well-established}} means of controlling ignition timing and {{heat release rate}} and is adopted in diesel engine combustion. Partially Pre-mixed Charge Compression Ignition (PPCI) also known as Premixed Charge Compression Ignition (PCCI) is a compromise offering the control of CIDI combustion with the reduced <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> of HCCI, specifically lower soot. The heat release rate is controlled by preparing the combustible mixture {{in such a way}} that combustion occurs over a longer time duration making it less prone to knocking. This is done by timing the injection event such that a range of air/fuel ratios spread across the combustion cylinder when ignition begins. Ignition occurs in different regions of the combustion chamber at different times - slowing the heat release rate. This mixture is designed to minimize the number of fuel-rich pockets, reducing soot formation. The adoption of high EGR and diesel fuels with a greater resistance to ignition (more [...] "gasoline like") enable longer mixing times before ignition and thus fewer rich pockets that produce soot and ...|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{the study}} is the {{automated}} computation of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> from timerelated measuring data sets. For the determination of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> in real world conditions, the test vehicle was equipped with a new On Board Measurement (OBM) system. The raw data provided by the OBM must be post processed to describe the vehicle performance. It is required to find out faulty data sets, to correct them, then to calculate necessary variables and to draw diagrams. In order to decrease the required time, all of these procedures have been automated. The data sets coming from the OBM system and the experimental data achieved during the driving tests are used to compute <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions,</b> the driving resistance, characteristic engine curves, fuel consumption et. All of these computations were automated using a website script interface in Matlab Simulink. For the identification and correction of the erroneous measured data, m-files with Matlab code were also written. As a result of this post-processing calculation several diagrams has been implemented. It is important to visualize gained information with diagrams, for this reason the procedures to obtain necessary diagrams were also automated. It can be concluded that the use of automated functions enables a more efficient study of the vehicle performance from real-world data. The real-world measurements of an Opel Zafira 1. 6 CNG ECOTEC with manual gearbox were used as a sample to calculate the engine characteristic maps.

40|$|In a first paper (part I), {{prechamber}} ignition in cogeneration {{natural gas}} engines {{has been shown}} to significantly intensify and accelerate the combustion process, offering a further potential to reduce the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> while keeping efficiency at a high level. This second part discusses the influence of the engine operating parameters (spark timing and load) and the turbocharger characteristics with the objective of evaluating the potential to reduce the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions,</b> particularity the CO emissions, below the Swiss limits (NOx and CO emissions: 250 and 650 mg/m 3 N, 5 % O 2, respectively), without exhaust gas after treatment. The advantage of using an unscavenged prechamber is conditioned by a significant delay of the spark timing in order to generate substantial gas jets. This results in a large decrease in peak cylinder pressure and in an important reduction of NOx, CO and THC emissions. Minimum emissions are achieved at a spark timing of about 8 °CABTDC. In comparison with the direct ignition, the prechamber ignition yields approximately 40 % and 55 % less CO and THC emissions, respectively. However, this also leads to about 2 %-point lower fuel conversion efficiency. The optimisation of the turbocharger results in a recovery of about 1 %-point in fuel conversion efficiency, but a consequent change in the exhaust manifold gas dynamics attenuates the reduction in THC emissions. At the rated power output (150 kW), the prechamber ignition operation fulfils the Swiss requirements for <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> and still achieves a fuel conversion efficiency higher than 36. 5 %...|$|E
