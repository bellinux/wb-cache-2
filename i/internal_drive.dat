5|$|The Mac Pro's Xeon {{processors}} generated {{much less}} heat {{than the previous}} dual-core G5s, so {{the size of the}} internal cooling devices were reduced significantly. This allowed the interior to be re-arranged, leaving more room {{at the top of the}} case and doubling the number of <b>internal</b> <b>drive</b> bays. This also allowed the elimination of the large clear plastic air deflector used as part of the cooling system in the Power Mac G5. Less heat also meant less air to move out of the case for cooling during normal operations; the Mac Pro was very quiet in normal operation, quieter than the much noisier Power Mac G5, and proved difficult to measure using common sound pressure level meters.|$|E

The Bandai ATMARK-PD {{was designed as a}} direct replacement of the original ATMARK footprint, and would have included an <b>internal</b> <b>drive</b> that can read a standard CD-ROM disc, as well as read/write to a magneto optical WORM PD disk with 600 MB of storage capacity.|$|E

50|$|Fan <b>drives</b> can be <b>internal</b> or external. <b>Internal</b> <b>drives</b> {{have the}} motor inside the {{autoclave}} in an unheated chamber. A thick wall of insulation keeps the heat out, and the motor is under full autoclave pressure. External drives require a shaft seal {{to carry the}} drive shaft through the pressure vessel wall. <b>Internal</b> <b>drives</b> are simpler, result in slightly less floor space taken, and impose a small but essential cooling load; external drives require more elaborate drive shaft arrangements and use high pressure seals.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>internal</b> <b>drives</b> are {{designed}} with parallel ATA interfaces, with SATA becoming more readily available. External drives almost always use USB 2.0 or IEEE 1394, with eSATA becoming an option as well.|$|R
25|$|The {{aspect of}} {{motivation}} within a person's personality may predict creativity {{levels in the}} person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an <b>internal</b> <b>drive</b> within a person to participate or invest {{as a result of}} personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.|$|E
500|$|Firstly {{conceived}} and still used today for optical storage devices (CD-RW drives, DVD drives, etc.), several manufacturers offer external portable USB hard disk drives, or empty enclosures for disk drives. These offer performance comparable to internal drives, {{limited by the}} current number and types of attached USB devices, and by the upper limit of the USB interface (in practice about 30MB/s for USB 2.0 and potentially 400MB/s or more for USB 3.0). These external drives typically include a [...] "translating device" [...] that bridges between a drive's interface to a USB interface port. Functionally, the drive appears to the user much like an <b>internal</b> <b>drive.</b> Other competing standards for external drive connectivity include eSATA, ExpressCard, FireWire (IEEE 1394), and most recently Thunderbolt.|$|E
2500|$|A {{small part}} of the {{workings}} of the drives is revealed in Galactic North. [...] The drive has six manual control dials that allow the power of the drive to be varied. [...] As the drive power is increased, so does the risk of an uncontrolled, ship destroying explosion. [...] Lighthuggers mount a pair of Conjoiner drives, both of which are controlled by a disembodied Conjoiner brain that performs rapid calculations to control the <b>internal</b> <b>drive</b> reactions. [...] If the turbulence within the drive exceeds the ability of the brain, the drive will explode. The drive is also designed to explode if non-Conjoiners attempt to open it for reverse engineering, or if the gap between two drives on the same ship grows too large. [...] This occurs because the Conjoiner brain is housed within one of the engines and controls the other remotely; once the other drive passes out of the brain's control, the internal reactions quickly spiral out of control.|$|E

50|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>drive</b> {{propulsion}} {{is a form}} {{of marine}} propulsion commonly used in recreational boating. Like other forms of motorized boating, <b>internal</b> <b>drive</b> propulsion employs a motor that turns a propeller to move the boat forward. The primary difference between <b>internal</b> <b>drive</b> boats and stern drive boats is that the propeller is enclosed inside the hull of an <b>internal</b> <b>drive</b> boat whereas the propeller is exposed outside the hull of a stern drive boat.|$|E
