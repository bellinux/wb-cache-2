The high purity copper bun ingots from the found in Late Bronze Age Britain and the Mediterranean seem to have undergone a secondary refining procedure between ...|$|E
40|$|Key words: The layer structure; {{different}} {{content of}} WC; wear resistance Abstract: In this paper, the WC and high-Cr Cast Iron layer were obtained {{on the surface}} of ZG 30 Cr steel by casting-penetrating process, the organization and wear properties of penetrating layer were studied. The results show that the layer is <b>dense,</b> without pores, <b>slag</b> and other defects, the penetrating layer and substrate are metallurgical bonding. When 20 %WC and 80 % Cr-Fe with are added to permeability agent, the penetrating layer has the best wear resistance, is 11. 3 times the matrix materials. Introductions The casting penetration is a new technology for using pouring liquid metal solidifying heat on the casting surface to form a special organization and performance of the composite layer [1 - 3]. By cast-chromized technology forms penetrating layer on the wear casting parts, It can not change the original composition of casting based on structure,not only ensure sufficient castings strength...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The WC and high-Cr {{cast iron}} layer were {{obtained}} {{on the surface}} of ZG 30 steel by infiltration casting process, so the surface alloying of ZG 30 steel was realized. The microstructures and phase structures of penetrating layer were studied by SEM, TEM, XRD, the hardness of the test material was measured by the hardness tester, and the wear resistance was tested by wear test machine. The mechanism of alloyed layer forming was analyzed. The effects of WC contents on the wear resistance of alloyed layer were studied. The results show that the layer is <b>dense,</b> without pores, <b>slag</b> and other defects, the thickness of the alloyed layer is about 6 - 7 mm, and the penetrating layer and matrix are metallurgical bonding. The maximum hardness of the alloyed layer surface is 820 Hv. When the content of WC is 15 %, the penetrating layer has the highest wear resistance which is 18. 8 times as high as the matrix...|$|R
