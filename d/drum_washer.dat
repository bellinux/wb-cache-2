5000|$|More advancements {{were made}} to washing machine {{technology}} {{in the form of}} the rotative drum design. Basically, these early design patents consisted of a <b>drum</b> <b>washer</b> that was hand-cranked to make the wooden drums rotate. While the technology was simple enough, it was a milestone in the history of washing machines, as it introduced the idea of [...] "powered" [...] washing drums. As metal drums started to replace the traditional wooden drums, it allowed for the drum to turn above an open fire or an enclosed fire chamber, raising the water temperature for more effective washes.|$|E
5000|$|The first English patent {{under the}} {{category}} of Washing machines was issued in 1791. [...] A drawing of an early washing machine appeared in the January 1752 issue of The Gentlemen's Magazine, a British publication. Jacob Christian Sch√§ffer's washing machine design was published 1767 in Germany. In 1782, Henry Sidgier issued a British patent for a rotating <b>drum</b> <b>washer,</b> and in the 1790s Edward Beetham sold numerous [...] "patent washing mills" [...] in England. One of the first innovations in washing machine technology was the use of enclosed containers or basins that had grooves, fingers, or paddles to help with the scrubbing and rubbing of the clothes. The person using the washer would use a stick to press and rotate the clothes along the textured sides of the basin or container, agitating the clothes to remove dirt and mud. [...] This crude agitator technology was hand-powered, but still more effective than actually hand-washing the clothes.|$|E
50|$|Thor {{invented the}} tilt-a-whirl {{system in which}} the agitator, {{typically}} in the shape of disk, tilted back and forth within the <b>washer</b> <b>drum</b> while simultaneously rotating. The early 1930s tilt-a-whirl design was the first agitator to move water in both a horizontal and vertical motion. The 1936 version of the Thor tilt-a-whirl incorporated sculpted hands embossed on the agitator. At the time, some Thor dealers painted the fingernails of the hands on demonstration machines.|$|R

Beal was garbage {{collector}} for the town of Cambria in the 1940s and 1950s and made good use of what Cambrians were throwing away, {{as well as the}} natural materials on the property, in the nearby pine forests, and on the area's beaches. Some parts are also reportedly remnants from Hearst Castle where he supposedly worked for a time. Other common building materials are beer cans, abalone shells, and concrete.

40|$|Washing {{of brown}} stock pulp {{is done to}} recover cooking chemicals, remove {{impurities}} such as metal ions and bleaching chemical consumptive ingredients from the pulp suspension and to salvage organic matter that {{can be turned into}} energy by burning. Washing stage performance can be evaluated by the dilution factor, which determines the water amount used for pulp ton, and washing loss, which determines the amount of washable components in pulp discharged with pulp to bleaching that could not be washed away. This study focused on utilization of brown stock washing stage upper level control, which was based on the real time online measurement of total dry solids of the pulp suspension and washer filtrates in several points of the process. Online measurements were used to determine the chemical state of the process and adjustments to dilution factor made accordingly. Trial runs including feed consistency, <b>washer</b> <b>drum</b> torque, washing water temperature and dilution factor were made to examine the effect of different variables to washing result. A longer test period was also made to determine the upper level effect on the chlorine dioxide consumption. According to results, improvements to upper level control were made to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the washing stage. Utilization of the upper level control was successful as it became the primary way of operating the washing stage. Upper level control was found to optimize wash water usage, level out process fluctuations and thereby decrease the washing loss and chlorine dioxide consumption significantly. Possibility to define precise dilution factor for the whole washing stage decreases evaporation plant load and enables more stable washing result...|$|R
40|$|The {{closure of}} the liquid system in a pulp mill has {{increased}} the concentration of metal ions in the process as compared to traditional plants. These ions {{commonly referred to as}} non-process elements, NPE, enter the pulp mill with the wood chips, the water supply and the pulping chemicals. The presence of these ions may lead to various problems, e. g. incrust formation, filtration failures and reduced bleaching efficiency and the objective of the pulp washing operation is to remove a major part of these metal ions from the pulp. The objective of this work was to study the influence of sorption of metal ions on the simulation of pulp washing. A process simulator, ASPEN Plus, has been used to describe the different steps in a displacement <b>drum</b> <b>washer.</b> In order to take account of the sorption of metal ions on the pulp fibres blocks with FORTRAN subroutines have been developed and included. The simulations studies show that the washing results are quite similar for all models at high concentration levels. Hence, the adsorption does not contribute significantly except for low concentration cases. The influence of the sorption model and thus also the choice of model is important only in washing stages where the concentration of ions is very low. Comparison with data for an industrial displacement <b>drum</b> <b>washer</b> indicated the usefulness of the simulation model in evaluation of the operation. It was found that the displacement-washing step was far from ideal probably due to uneven liquid distribution and formation problems. For washing of solids other than paper pulp, e. g. lime mud, the effect of sorption metal ions on the washing result is less pronounced and a simpler model can be used with good results...|$|E
40|$|The {{reconfiguration}} of {{an existing}} five-stage bleaching D 0 E 1 D 1 E 2 D 2 sequence is proposed to ensure the minimal formation of organochlorine compounds, expressed as AOX, in the bleach plant of a kraft pulp mill processing Eucalyptus globulus wood. This reduction of the load of AOX in the effluents can be achieved without introducing new and expensive technologies in the bleaching process. In practice, this goal {{can be achieved by}} eliminating the washing step between the D 0 and the E 1 stages. With this strategy, the total AOX in the liquid effluent of the bleach plant can be reduced by almost 65 % while maintaining a level of 90 % ISO brightness of the pulp and even diminishing the degradation of its polysaccharides. With this process redesign, the total AOX discharge from the bleach plant can be decreased from 1. 2 to 0. 42 kg/t prior to any biological treatment. Furthermore, the proposed modified (D 0 E 1) D 1 E 2 D 2 sequence enables the reduction of the total flow rate of effluent to be treated and also the total consumption of water, which is quite critical in these types of plants. Moreover, with this strategy, one is able to move the first <b>drum</b> <b>washer</b> of a conventional bleaching sequence to the entrance of the bleach plant. This gives rise to a cleaner pulp and therefore to lower requirements of chlorine dioxide, which in turn will enable further reductions in the global AOX generation. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on seven {{publications}} dealing with separation processes applied in the manufacturing of chemical pulp. The first part discusses the correlation of mass transfer phenomena in the ultrafiltration of spent cooking liquor. The second part focuses on the fiber mat formation {{that takes place in}} pulp washers and thickeners. The main interest throughout the thesis is to develop useful and scientifically justified methods for correlating mass transfer and filtration mechanisms in order to interpret the phenomena taking place in the studied unit operations. The methods presented can be used in the designing and dimensioning of industrial-scale equipment and systems. Two types of basic mass transfer models, the film model and a more complete approach utilizing an integral solution for two-dimensional diffusion, have been introduced for the calculation of the macrosolute concentration at the surface of the ultrafiltration membrane. A pilot-scale test rig was used to measure ultrafiltration of spent cooking liquor. Mass transfer correlations to estimate the permeate flux have been developed based on both models to be used for plant design calculations. The modeling studies indicated that the integral solution method gave a physically more realistic behavior for the macrosolute concentration at the membrane wall than the widely used film model. It was further shown that dynamic programming may be effectively used to optimize a multistage industrial-scale ultrafiltration-diafiltration process. This method required a shorter calculation time and resulted in slightly better optimal conditions than the direct search algorithm. The studies on mat formation during pulp washing showed that the washing tester is a useful tool to obtain the required information for the washer. A calculation procedure has been developed to obtain design parameters for the dimensioning of industrial pulp washers. The suggested theory was based on Darcy's law under the conditions of constant pressure filtration of incompressible beds and reasonable accuracy was obtained for purposes of washer design. A more accurate approach for the modeling of the mat formation stage was formulated on the fundamental filtration theory of compressible fiber beds. Two such methods were discussed. In the more general model of mat formation, the equation of continuity during filtration was also taken into account. This model was then used for evaluating the effect of various operational parameters on <b>drum</b> <b>washer</b> performance. This model was also able to predict earlier generated experimental test data rather well. A new method for considering the additional filtration resistance due to suspended gases (e. g. air) was also suggested. reviewe...|$|E
50|$|Vitreous enamel {{has many}} useful properties: it is smooth, hard, {{chemically}} resistant, durable, scratch resistant (5-6 on the Mohs scale), has long-lasting colour fastness, {{is easy to}} clean, and cannot burn. Enamel is glass, not paint, so it does not fade under ultraviolet light. A disadvantage of enamel {{is a tendency to}} crack or shatter when the substrate is stressed or bent, but modern enamels are relatively chip- and impact-resistant because of good thickness control and coefficients of thermal expansion well-matched to the metal. The Buick automobile company was founded by David Dunbar Buick with wealth earned by his development of improved enamelling processes, c. 1887, for sheet steel and cast iron. Such enameled ferrous material had, and still has, many applications: early 20th century and some modern advertising signs, interior oven walls, cooking pots, housing and interior walls of major kitchen appliances, housing and <b>drums</b> of clothes <b>washers</b> and dryers, sinks and cast iron bathtubs, farm storage silos, and processing equipment such as chemical reactors and pharmaceutical process tanks. Structures such as filling stations, bus stations and Lustron Houses had walls, ceilings and structural elements made of enamelled steel. One of the most widespread modern uses of enamel is in the production of quality chalk-boards and marker-boards (typically called 'blackboards' or 'whiteboards') where the resistance of enamel to wear and chemicals ensures that 'ghosting', or unerasable marks, do not occur, as happens with polymer boards. Since standard enamelling steel is magnetically attractive, it may also be used for magnet boards. Some new developments {{in the last ten years}} include enamel/non-stick hybrid coatings, sol-gel functional top-coats for enamels, enamels with a metallic appearance, and new easy-to-clean enamels.|$|R
40|$|Abstract There {{are many}} aspects {{on how to}} improve the paper pulping process. In the washing {{sequence}} improvements to decrease the discharge to the environment can be achieved by closure of the liquid system and recycling liquid from other parts pulp process. The objective of the pulp washing operation is to remove the liquor containing organic material such as dissolved lignin, and also inorganic material including the so called non-process elements. Cations, for example iron, manganese, magnesium etc. fall under the category non-process elements. These cations are very important to remove in the washing sequence since they cause problems during bleaching by decomposing the bleaching chemicals. The cations also cause filtration failure and incrust formation in the evaporator system. The washing should be performed with minimum amount of water to avoid diluting the liquor that is later evaporated before it is burnt in the recovery boiler. To investigate various aspects of pulp washing a simulation model is helpful. Using a process simulator such as ASPEN Plus the different steps in a displacement <b>drum</b> <b>washer</b> can be described. In order to take account for the sorption of cations ions on the pulp fibres, blocks with an equilibrium model has to be included. The equilibrium model is encoded using FORTRAN. In the literature different models have been presented to take account for the sorption effects, the Langmuir isotherm, the Donnan model and the distribution coefficient model. In the presentation a comparison between these models is be made and how the simulation results are be influenced. Comparing the three adsorption models, The Donnan model was found to need the most data for the specific set of pulp and ions, second in that aspect is the Langmuir isotherm, and least amount of data are required for the distribution constant model. Results from the simulation show that the influence of the sorption model and thus also the choice of model is important only in washing stages where the concentration of ions is very low. One way to decrease the water consumption {{and at the same time}} decrease the release of process water to the environment is to use condensate as washliquid. Condensates are produced in the cooking section and in the evaporator system. Depending on the origin of condensates they contain different amount of impurities, methanol, COD and sulfite substances for example. Sulfite substances have a very strong odour even at low concentration levels and can therefore cause problems both in the process and in the final product. Condensates do, however, have very low concentration of cations and are therefore suitable as washliquid. To investigate the possibility of using condensate as washliquid washing experiments were performed on bleached and unbleached pulp. The two pulps were washed with four condensates with different concentration of COD. The washing results were consistently good but some unexpected results were obtained for the case where the condensate with the highest concentration of COD was used. The characteristic of the pulp was then investigated by an adsorption study including manganese, calcium and magnesium.
