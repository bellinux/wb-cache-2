500|$|Since {{its last}} eruptive {{activity}} in the mid-19th century, Mount St. Helens had been largely dormant. Seismographs were not installed until 1972. This period of more than 100 years of inactivity ended in early 1980. On March 15, a cluster of tiny earthquakes rocked {{the area around the}} mountain. For six days, more than 100 earthquakes clustered around Mount St. Helens, an indication that magma was moving. There was initially some doubt as to whether the earthquakes were precursors to an eruption. By March 20, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake shook the wilderness around the volcano. The next day, seismologists installed three seismic recorder stations. By March 24, volcanologists at the USGS—including Johnston—became more confident that the seismic activity was a sign of an impending eruption. After March 25, seismic activity drastically increased. By March 26, more than seven earthquakes over magnitude 4.0 had been recorded, and the next day, <b>hazard</b> <b>warnings</b> were publicly issued.

40|$|<b>Hazard</b> <b>warning</b> {{is an area}} of {{research}} that requires both <b>hazard</b> evaluation and <b>warning</b> dissemination. At present, no such system carrying out both <b>hazard</b> evaluation and <b>warning</b> communication directly to the user community exists. Thus, there has been a need to develop an automated integrated system to categorize <b>hazard</b> and issue <b>warning</b> that reaches users directly. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop an integrated, independent, generalized, and automated geo-hazard warning system, making use of geo-spatial data under popular usage platform. Thus, in this paper, development of GEOWARNS, an automated geo-spatial <b>hazard</b> <b>warning</b> system, has been elaborated. Testing and validation of the developed system has been carried out for landslide hazard evaluation and its warning dissemination pertaining to a comprehensive case study in Italy. The functionality of GEOWARNS is modular in architecture, having input, understanding, rainfall prediction, expert, output, and warning modules. The categories of hazard zones that have been evaluated by GEOWARNS show discrepancy of 5. 9 % in high hazard zones, nearly approximately 1. 1 and 3. 8 % in moderate- and low-hazard zones, respectively, in comparison with the in situ expert evaluation. Further, the message dissemination through local cellular network has been found to be immediate with a maximum time lag recorded of 50 s, a minimum of 5 s, and an average of 15 s within the acceptable limits as indicated by the authorities in the United Nations (UN). Thus, it can be concluded that an automated <b>hazard</b> <b>warning</b> system has been developed. However, other scopes are needed to develop it furthe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{research}} {{describes the}} implementation of a novel and stand-alone system for dynamic <b>hazard</b> <b>warning.</b> The system uses all existing infrastructure already in place like mobile networks, a laptop/PC and the small installation software. The geospatial dataset are the maps of a region which are again frugal. Hence {{there is no need to}} invest and it reaches everyone with a mobile. A novel architecture of <b>hazard</b> assessment and <b>warning</b> introduced where major technologies in ICT interfaced to give a unique WebGIS based dynamic real time geohazard warning communication system. A never before architecture introduced for integrating WebGIS with telecommunication technology. Existing technologies interfaced in a novel architectural design to address a neglected domain in a way never done before – through dynamically updatable WebGIS based warning communication. The work publishes new architecture and novelty in addressing <b>hazard</b> <b>warning</b> techniques in sustainable way and user friendly manner. Coupling of hazard zonation and <b>hazard</b> <b>warning</b> procedures into a single system has been shown. Generalized architecture for deciphering a range of geo-hazards has been developed. Hence the developmental work presented here can be summarized as the development of internet-SMS based automated geo-hazard warning communication system; integrating a warning communication system with a hazard evaluation system; interfacing different open-source technologies towards design and development of a warning system; modularization of different technologies towards development of a warning communication system; automated data creation, transformation and dissemination over different interfaces. The architecture of the developed warning system has been functionally automated as well as generalized enough that can be used for any hazard and setup requirement has been kept to a minimum.

The functionality of the system is modular in architecture having input, understanding, expert, output and warning modules. Thus, the system provides flexibility in integration between different types of hazard evaluation and communication systems leading to a generalized <b>hazard</b> <b>warning</b> system.
