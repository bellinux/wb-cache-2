5|$|Dam asked Vann, who was {{circling}} the battlefield aboard an L-19 reconnaissance aircraft, to reconnoiter possible landing zones {{on the east}} and west sides of Ap Bac, where additional reinforcements could be inserted to launch their attacks. In response, Vann asked his pilot to make low passes over the trees which covered Ap Bac. Although he could not see any Viet Cong positions, Vann <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> well-fortified position {{at the south end of}} the hamlet, due to the impact of the Viet Cong's firepower on the Civil Guards since the battle's inception. As Vann's L-19 aircraft flew over the western tree line, the Viet Cong watched from their foxholes, but held their fire because they knew the aircraft was trying to draw fire in order to mark their positions. Although Vann was suspicious, he decided it was a better landing zone because the area was tranquil despite the heavy fighting elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Within Attorney General Palmer's Justice Department, the General Intelligence Division (GID) {{headed by}} J. Edgar Hoover {{had become a}} {{storehouse}} of information about radicals in America. It had infiltrated many organizations and, following the raids of November 1919 and January 1920, it had interrogated thousands of those arrested and read through boxes of publications and records seized. Though agents in the GID <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> gap between what the radicals promised in their rhetoric {{and what they were}} capable of accomplishing, they nevertheless told Palmer they had evidence of plans for an attempted overthrow of the U.S. government on May Day 1920.|$|E
25|$|Frost {{concluded}} {{the decision to}} sign construction contracts {{so close to the}} November 2014 state election was imprudent and exposed the state to significant cost and risk when it <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> significant risk that legal challenges would prevent it from proceeding. He said the project’s business case had not clearly established the need for the investment; {{had not been able to}} demonstrate the accuracy and plausibility of the assumed wider economic benefits; had not addressed major concerns by peer reviewers over traffic modelling raised; and had not provided a sound basis for prioritising the eastern section over other sections of the road. Frost said the decision to start work first on the eastern section had been a government policy decision rather than being based on cost-benefit analysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{house had}} a major roof leak that forced {{an end to the}} house tours in 1998. An {{architectural}} assessment was performed on the house and the cost to reconstruct the house was estimated between $116,020 and $126,220. Before the roof was repaired, there was a broken pipe in the dining room. The break happened in January 1999. It dumped 500,000 gallons of water through the first floor and into the basement. The rising basement waters extinguished the furnace, causing the water in the pipes and the radiators to freeze, then burst. City water meters <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> problem somewhere in the city, but no one could find the source of the leak. A volunteer at the house discovered the leak. The volunteer arranged for a heating repairman to stop the flooding. When the repairman left, he slammed the door closed. The door frame was so swollen that the volunteer was stuck inside. She had to go upstairs and call for help through a front window.|$|E

These troops were loyal to their supreme commander twenty years ago, so why shouldn't they be so today." [...] Himmler awarded both Malkoč and Schweiger the Iron Cross Second Class for thwarting the mutiny. Five soldiers were also decorated.|$|E
500|$|On July 30, 2011, Davis {{was traded}} with pitcher Tommy Hunter to the Baltimore Orioles for {{reliever}} Koji Uehara. Davis became expendable because the Rangers felt Moreland {{was a better}} option at first base; Rangers' general manager Jon Daniels said {{the day of the}} trade that he <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> possibility Davis could turn into a high-impact offensive player and [...] "If he does, we'll live with it." [...] Opinions differ as to Davis's inability to hold a consistent starting role with the Rangers; while one popular theory is that it was because of his many strikeouts and low batting average, Orioles' manager Buck Showalter believes it was due to the presence of Moreland and Adrián Beltré in Texas. Davis said, [...] "I'm glad to get the opportunity to come here", citing his desire to play every day.|$|E
500|$|Phantasmagoria was {{the first}} Sierra On-Line game script to be written like a film screenplay. During the writing stage, Williams was under {{pressure}} to ensure Phantasmagoria was a commercial success for Sierra. She also faced concerns from her husband Ken Williams, the company president and co-founder of Sierra, who wanted the company {{to focus more on}} lower-cost, combat-oriented animated games, and was also concerned about the level of violence in Phantasmagoria. Williams said she knew the rape scene in particular would be controversial, but she felt it was essential to the plot because it was a turning point that made Adrienne realize something was deeply wrong with Don. She felt {{the rest of the story}} [...] "would make no sense" [...] without the scene, but also <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> chance it would be cut from the game before production ended.|$|E

500|$|Through {{the tour}} Mars {{and his band}} mates used Sennheiser microphones, with the former relying on the Sennheiser SKM 5200-II {{wireless}} transmitter and MD 5235 capsule. James Berry, monitor engineer for Bruno Mars, remembered [...] "When I took on the Bruno Mars gig over two to half a year ago (The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour), he and the background singers were using a competitor's model. I just <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> better microphone and capsule combination for him". Over the time, every vocalist on the band changed the microphones they used, {{it all started with}} the background singers, followed by [...] "the front-of-house guy" [...] and finally Bruno Mars. The same brand of equipment was used for the wireless audio during the tour. Derek Brener, in charge of Wireless Touring Rig, is the front of house engineer for three to half a year ago.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong {{prepared}} {{his famous}} epigram on his own. In a post-flight press conference, {{he said that}} he decided on the words [...] "just prior to leaving the LM [...]" [...] In a 1983 interview in Esquire Magazine, Armstrong explained to George Plimpton: [...] "I always <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good chance of being able to return to Earth, but I thought the chances of a successful touchdown on the moon surface were about even money—fifty–fifty... Most people don't realize how difficult the mission was. So it didn't seem to me there was much point in thinking of something to say if we'd have to abort landing." [...] In 2012, brother Dean Armstrong claimed that Neil had shown him a note with a draft of the line months before the launch, although historian Andrew Chaikin, who had interviewed the astronaut in 1988 for his book A Man on the Moon, disputed that he had ever claimed coming up with the line spontaneously during the mission.|$|E
500|$|With {{the loss}} of the ship the transcontinental plans were abandoned, and the focus shifted to that of survival. [...] Shackleton's {{intention}} now was to march the crew westward, to one or other of several possible destinations. His first thought was for Paulet Island, where he <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> hut containing a substantial food depot, because he had ordered it 12years earlier while organising relief for Otto Nordenskiöld’s stranded Swedish expedition. Other possibilities were Snow Hill Island, which had been Nordenskiöld’s winter quarters and which was believed to contain a stock of emergency supplies, [...] or Robertson Island. Shackleton believed that from one of these islands {{they would be able to}} reach and cross Graham Land, and get to the whaling outposts in Wilhelmina Bay. He calculated that on the day Endurance [...] was abandoned they were 346 miles from Paulet Island. Worsley calculated the distance to Snow Hill Island to be , with a further [...] to Wilhelmina Bay. He believed the march was too risky; they should wait until the ice carried them to open water, and then escape in the boats. Shackleton overruled him.|$|E

500|$|On 19 January 1915 the expedition's ship, the Endurance, was beset in the Weddell Sea pack ice. In {{the early}} efforts to free her, Crean {{narrowly}} escaped being crushed {{by a sudden}} movement in the ice. The ship drifted in the ice for months, eventually sinking on 21 November. Shackleton informed the men that they would drag the food, gear, and three lifeboats across the pack ice, to Snow Hill or Robertson Island, [...] away. Because of uneven ice conditions, pressure ridges, and the danger of ice breakup which could separate the men, they soon abandoned this plan: the men pitched camp and decided to wait. They hoped that the clockwise drift of the pack would carry them [...] to Paulet Island where they <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> hut with emergency supplies. But the pack ice held firm as it carried the men well past Paulet Island, and did not break up until 9 April. The crew then had to sail and row the three ill-equipped lifeboats through the pack ice to Elephant Island, a trip which lasted five days. Crean and Hubert Hudson, the navigating officer of the Endurance, piloted their lifeboat with Crean effectively in charge as Hudson appeared to have suffered a breakdown.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E
