Approximate <b>field</b> <b>matching</b> is the key solution to resolve the problem by identifying semantically equivalent string values in syntactically different representations. This paper considers token-based solutions and proposes a general <b>field</b> <b>matching</b> framework to generalize the <b>field</b> <b>matching</b> problem in different domains. By introducing a concept of String Matching Points (SMP) in string comparison, string matching accuracy and efficiency are improved, compared with other commonly-applied <b>field</b> <b>matching</b> algorithms.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the accuracy of <b>field</b> <b>matching</b> in patients treated by irradiation of the breast and adjacent lymph nodes. <b>Field</b> <b>matching</b> is performed by the radiographers during each session on a match line drawn on the patient's skin. Field edge positions were assessed in the cranial match plane of tangential breast fields and supraclavicular-axillary fields using an electronic portal imaging device and match line markers placed on the skin of the patients. The mean gap/overlap of the four fields for individual patients during each treatment session, derived from 374 marker projections, was + 0. 5 mm indicating that no systematic gap or overlap was observed. The uncertainty in the position of the four fields with respect to the match plane ranges from 3. 1 to 5. 1 mm (1 SD) for the individual patients. Gaps and overlaps between fields were also related to an absolute match line position, found by comparison of simulator and portal images, showing a small systematic uncertainty of 2. 4 mm and a standard deviation of 3. 3 mm. It can be concluded that the use of an electronic portal imaging device in combination with match line markers is a good method to quantify the accuracy of <b>field</b> <b>matching</b> in vivo. The results showed good stability and reproducibility in the <b>field</b> <b>matching</b> region for this treatment technique of breast cancer irradiation...|$|E

40|$|Two {{approaches}} for calculating the compensating feed array complex excitations are namely, the indirect conjugate <b>field</b> <b>matching</b> (ICFM) and the direct conjugate <b>field</b> <b>matching</b> (DCFM) approach. In the ICFM approach the compensating feed array excitations {{are determined by}} considering the transmitting mode and the reciprocity principle. The DCF, in contrast calculates the array excitations by integrating directly the induced surface currents on the reflector under a receiving mode. DCFM allows the reflector to be illuminated by an incident plane wave with a tapered amplitude. The level of taper can effectively control the sidelobe level of the compensated antenna pattern. Both approaches are examined briefly...|$|E

40|$|In {{magnetic}} resonance imaging, rapidly switching magnetic fields {{are used to}} spatially encode the signal. The temporal change of these fields induces eddy currents in nearby conducting structures of the scanner. These eddy currents, in turn, generate a secondary magnetic field that opposes and distorts the desired gradient field. Eddy current compensation methods are generally applied assuming that the primary and secondary magnetic field gradients possess similar spatial characteristics in the imaging volume (<b>field</b> <b>matching).</b> In this work an optimization method is used to deform {{the shape of the}} coil support and/or a highly conductive passive shield in order to improve the <b>field</b> <b>matching</b> and reduce the inductive coupling between the gradient coil and the passive shield. Using the residual field after eddy current compensation as the objective function, the coil support and/or conducting surfaces were deformed to obtain passively shielded x- and z-gradient coils with improved <b>field</b> <b>matching</b> and eddy current compensation. Assuming a single frequency, quasi-static simulation, it was demonstrated that the residual field was reduced up to 24 times by reshaping the coil and passive shield surfaces due to the improved <b>field</b> <b>matching.</b> However, using transient analyses we showed {{that in the case of}} the passively shielded x-gradient coil the residual field may only be reduced by five times from a cylindrical coil configuration. A bulge shape is created in the conducting surface as a mechanism of matching the field and at the same time reducing the mutual inductive coupling between the coil and the passive shield. An actively shielded coil with control over the magnetic field produced by the induced current was used as a reference coil that produces the minimal residual field. The actively shielded gradient coil produces minimal residual field for short and long pulses in the transient analyses. Â© 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|E

40|$|The {{main problem}} of craniospinal {{irradiation}} (CSI) is the matching of the fields. The {{use of a}} suitable technique is very important because matching of the fields is necessary to use for the optimal cancer irradiation of the long planning target volume (PTV). Since 2007, 8 patients have received CT-based, 3 D-planned conformal CSI in our Institute. Patient immobilization was made in prone position in a vacuum bed, using skull and pelvis masks. Organ-at-risk (OAR) contours were made by radiographers. PTV was contoured by radiation oncologists. The prescribed dose to the PTV was 36 Gy with 1. 8 Gy dose per fraction. In the planning process the following aspects were taken under consideration: all points of the PTV had to receive at least 95 % of the prescribed dose (according to ICRU 50, 62); at junction field edges the overlapping parts were eliminated using a multisegmental technique, where the adjacent segment ends of the neighbouring fields were shifted two times 2 cm, so that the three equally weighted segments used in one field had 2 - 2 cm distance from each other. In the CSI planning {{the shape of the}} patient and so the length of the PTV has made a big emphasis on determining the number of <b>field</b> <b>matching.</b> Thus in some cases instead of two, only one <b>field</b> <b>matching</b> was sufficient - this could be achieved by increasing the source-to-skin distance (SSD) of the fields. The verification made with a solid-water phantom justified the precision of the <b>field</b> <b>matching.</b> The offset used at junction field edges in between one treatment facilitates the verification of <b>field</b> <b>matching</b> - and so the patient positioning. Thus the possibility of having overdosed regions could be reduced, which was very important from a radiation biological point of view. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{directivity}} of a reflector antenna deteriorates as {{the feed}} {{moves away from}} the focal point for beam scanning. This deterioration can be substantially reduced if a cluster feed instead of single feed is used to control a beam. A closed-form solution is presented for the cluster excitation to achieve the optimum directivity. For an offset 108 lambda parabolic reflector scanning 10 beamwidths, the optimum directivity achieved by a 19 -element (seven-element) cluster is 12 dB (8 dB) higher than that of a single element. Comparison of the optimum-directivity design and the popular conjugate <b>field</b> <b>matching</b> design is made. When the cluster spacing d is greater than 1 lambda, it is found that the optimum directivity is higher than that of conjugate <b>field</b> <b>matching</b> (CFM) scheme by an insignificant amount, although the excitations of two designs can be quite different. For d less than 0. 5 lambda, the optimum design may exhibit the supergain phenomenon, namely extremely high directivities achieved by an oscillatory cluster excitation...|$|E
