AD has been more used by developing countries than developed countries between 1995 and 2005. China has been the main target of AD practices and metal sector has been the main concern of AD practices by the WTO Members.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} WTO Appellate Body Report on United States-Anti-Dumping Measures on Oil Country Tubular Goods (OCTG) from Mexico (WT/DS 282 /AB/R 2 November 2005). This dispute {{concerns}} the disciplines {{imposed by the}} Anti-Dumping Agreement on WTO Members seeking to extend their anti-dumping measures beyond the original five-year period through a so-called sunset review. Our analysis focuses on the Appellate Body's finding {{in this case that}} no causation analysis is required in sunset reviews, and addresses the AB's approach towards the legal instrument that provides for the US policy in terms of sunset reviews, the Sunset Policy Bulletin. We conclude that the Anti-Dumping Agreement, as interpreted by the Appellate Body in this and other similar cases, imposes only minimal disciplines of a general nature on Members wishing to extend the anti-dumping measure beyond its original five-year period. We argue that the ‘textual' argument relied on to support this deferential approach is weak and has resulted in undermining the practical effect of, what was considered to be, one of the major achievements of the Uruguay Round Anti-Dumping Agreement: limiting the life span of an anti-dumping measure to five years. From an economic perspective, Panels and the Appellate Body are simply debating the wrong type of questions. The prospective nature required by a sunset review analysis raises questions such as why exporters engaged in dumping in the first place, and what the conditions of the industry were so that the <b>dumped</b> <b>imports</b> caused injury.

40|$|Despite {{its other}} successes, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) {{has been criticized}} as being {{anything}} but successful in the antidumping arena. In particular, industries in the United States argue that GATT has failed to control dumping effectively and that alternative forms of relief are needed to counteract this unfair trade practice. The root of their concerns is the prospective nature of the existing remedy. Since antidumping duties are assessed only after a violation has been detected, dumping is essentially a risk-free, no-lose proposition, giving foreign exporters a free 2 ̆ 2 first bite at the apple. 2 ̆ 2 The absence of monetary damages for injuries sustained {{as a result of}} dumping compounds manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 difficulties. In response to the growing sentiment that American trade laws do not reflect the realities of international commerce, Congress has introduced several initiatives seeking to strengthen these laws to combat unfair trade practices more effectively. One specific proposal, which has received a flood of congressional interest but little scholarly attention, is the establishment of a private right of action to counteract illegal dumping. In contrast to the current procedure that requires an administrative proceeding to determine the propriety of imposing an antidumping duty, such a proposal would give United States industries direct access to federal courts to recover monetary damages for any injury caused by dumping and, in some cases, to receive injunctive relief halting the entry of <b>dumped</b> <b>imports.</b> Despite its favorable implications, a private right of action raises grave concerns over its compatibility with the United States 2 ̆ 7 s international obligations under GATT.

40|$|The United States {{and other}} {{countries}} enforce their antidumping regulations in roughly the same way. There is a difference, however. The United States–but not other countries [...] now uses ‘zeroing’ in its determination of whether <b>imports</b> are <b>dumped.</b> The use of ‘zeroing’ will almost always increase the level of any antidumping duty, and will sometimes create a duty where none would have been imposed, had the methodology not been used. All countries test for dumping by attempting to determine whether imports are being sold at less than ‘normal’ value. Other countries do this by simply comparing the average price at which the product is sold {{in the country of}} production with the average price at which the same product is sold in the importing market. If the average of the observed prices in the importing country is lower than the average price in the country of production (the ‘normal’ value), then the foreign firm is said to be dumping. Using zeroing, however, the U. S. treats import price observations above the ‘normal’ value as if they occurred at the ‘normal’ value (rather than at their observed level). Transactions at prices below the normal value are treated at their observed levels. The result of zeroing has been to make the U. S. antidumping laws more restrictive than they might appear, with a positive antidumping margin potentially being found if any single transaction occurs below ‘normal’ value, even if the average of the import prices in the U. S. is much higher than the ‘normal’ value. The U. S. practice of zeroing has recently been challenged at least six times before the World Trade Organization (WTO), and has generally been found to be inconsistent with the WTO obligations of the United States. The net impact of the zeroing methodology on the United States (compared to antidumping enforcement without zeroing) depends inter alia on the dispersion of the U. S. prices obtained by foreign exporters under dumping investigation. No real estimates of this dispersion exist, but the paper discusses some related evidence which may permit an inference. This evidence is itself quite dispersed, and, therefore, an estimate of the impact and cost of zeroing to the United States has a broad range of uncertainty. But it is plausible that zeroing could add perhaps 3 - 4 % to the typical U. S. antidumping duty with a cost to the U. S. of around $ 150 million per year when all existing U. S. antidumping orders were determined by zeroing. Trade, <b>Dumping,</b> <b>Import,</b> Zeroing, United States, WTO...|$|R
40|$|The {{launching}} of the T-FTA in June 2015 presents {{an opportunity for}} accelerating regional integration in Africa towards {{the establishment of a}} single market through deepening COMESA-EAC-SADC integration. This milestone can contribute positively to African development. Nevertheless, it faces different structural and technical challenges, including the risk of aggressive export strategies and unfair trade practices, which may wipe away a substantial part of the integration gains. This could undermine African integration plans and the largely infant industries in Africa, especially since many African countries lack sufficient technical skills, institutional capacity, and the legal framework to deal efficiently and effectively with unfair trade practices and to respond to situations which may require the application of emergency tools to better adapt to economic challenges. Apart from Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa and Zambia national Trade Defence Instruments (TDIs) are not well developed. This could further constrain the ambitious African plans of economic integration. The thesis concludes that, although an effective TDI system is crucial for African integration as it can provide the required protection for African infant industries and unlock the potentials of African economic integration, the current African TDI systems are not effective. This is confirmed by the limited resort to TDIs in the African continent and the general perception that an effective TDI system is not a priority on the integration agenda. The concluded T-FTA TDI legal regime is not supportive for African integration plans in the long run. Africa should envisage how to upgrade its TDI system to make better use of the tools available under the WTO to deal with unfair trade measures, including anti-dumping to face <b>dumped</b> <b>imports,</b> countervailing measures to face subsidized imports, and safeguard measures to temporarily suspend concessions in the face of surge in imports. Africa can improve its national and regional TDIs system by learning from more developed TDI systems incorporated by other economic blocks such as the EU, NAFTA, Mercosur, and ASEAN. This thesis submits that the EU TDIs system is the most suitable to the African integration objectives. This submission is made while recognising the different level of development on both sides. The thesis submits that the long-term objective of the T-FTA is to have a regional investigating authority. It draws several recommendations to enhance African TDI system by working on five main categories: (A) The strategic direction; (B) The institutional framework; (C) Enhancing engagements; (D) Application of TDIs; and (E) The supportive factors.

No entanto, desde o GATT 1947 há preocupação com o uso abusivo de tais medidas, podendo ser o mecanismo utilizado não apenas para possibilitar a recuperação da indústria doméstica prejudicada pelas importações objeto de dumping, objetivo do Acordo Antidumping (AAD), mas com o fim de proteger a indústria nacional da concorrência estrangeira. Desta forma, o objetivo do presente trabalho é apresentar as principais características do AAD firmado ao final da Rodada Uruguai que culminou na constituição da Organização Mundial do Comércio (OMC), incluindo seus antecedentes históricos e a possibilidade de aplicação discricionária, demonstrando como uma norma surgida no plano internacional em decorrência de um acordo multilateral vem sendo utilizada pelo Brasil, com a finalidade de se demonstrar a possibilidade de uso das medidas antidumping como barreira à entrada no mercado brasileiro. Confirmada a possibilidade de uso abusivo desse instrumento de defesa comercial, ainda que no plano teórico, uma vez que não é possível analisar os efeitos reais das medidas aplicadas, serão apresentadas as formas de contrabalanço ao protecionismo atualmente existentes no próprio AAD e sua incorporação e utilização pelo Brasil bem como a possibilidade de questionamento de tais medidas como práticas anticompetitivas com fundamento na legislação antitruste perante as autoridades de defesa da concorrência. Serão ainda analisadas outras possibilidades de contrabalanço ao uso exacerbado das medidas antidumping em debate e viabilidade das mesmas no cenário atual em que se verifica, de um lado, o aumento de uso de tais medidas pelos países Membros da OMC, destacando-se o Brasil e, de outro lado, impasse nas negociações multilaterais, cabendo aos Membros tomarem decisões unilaterais sobre a aplicação de tais medidas, seu grau de intensidade e forma de aplicação a depender da proteção que se pretende garantir à indústria nacional.

Additional possibilities under debate and their feasibility to counterbalance the abuse in the use of the antidumping measures will also be analyzed in the actual scenario where, on one hand, there is the increase of such measures by WTO Members in general and mainly Brazil and, on the other hand, there is an impasse in the multilateral negotiations.

40|$|The report {{identifies}} {{concerns with}} the EU anti-dumping instrument, as applied today, {{regardless of the}} fact that the investigation procedures and methods might be in line with the current regulation and practice. The report's arguments are based on the recent anti-dumping investigation – and imposition of anti-dumping measures – on imports of ceramic tiles from China, but the observations and conclusions from the analysis are valid for most EU anti-dumping investigations. The report observes that price dumping is evaluated differently depending on whether the product is manufactured in the EU or imported from third countries. What is considered to be price <b>dumping</b> when <b>imported</b> is considered normal competition for a product manufactured in the EU. This is due to the fact that spatial price differentiation within the EU is covered by competition rules, and that competition rules have higher requirements for market share and price undercutting than the anti-dumping legislation. The report, accordingly, advocates that the criteria for imposing anti-dumping duties should be harmonized to the EU competition rules in order to ensure fair competition on the EU market. In the absence of a reformed anti-dumping regulation, the anti-dumping measures will most likely only contribute to a distorted competition where the complaining EU manufacturing industry will be protected to the detriment of the consumers. ...|$|R

Therefore the sustainable growth of the agriculture sector, facilitated by some protection, is necessary for equitable economic development. As the country budget restricts domestic support, the SP and SSM modalities would be the most suitable protective tools.

Zeroing, therefore, may increase the cost to the U. S. of import protection without any corresponding benefit. The net impact of the zeroing methodology on the United States (compared to antidumping enforcement without zeroing) depends inter alia on the dispersion of the U.

Force curve and force value of each key point in the sub-frame was obtained under unloaded condition by simulation of unloading operation. The {{results showed that the}} strength and stiffness of the sub-frame under pure bending condition and the initial stage of unloaded condition meet the requirements；In critical slipped stage of cargo, the maximum stress of the rear rotating shaft of sub-frame is greater than the yield limit of the materials, and its position is consistent with fault location in the practical application...|$|R

During the late 1950s OAF trucks were {{imported from the}} West, and Berliet T60 <b>dump</b> trucks were <b>imported</b> in 1969 to open the mine and ore-processing plant of Ai in the Orenburg Oblast. Tractors from Volvo and Mercedes-Benz NG were imported during the 1970s for the road-transport organization Sovtransavto. Unic-Fiat tractors were imported in the mid-1970s for the port of Leningrad, and Unit Rig and International Harvester Paystar dump trucks and cement mixers {{were used for the}} construction of irrigation canals from 1979 to 1983. Fawn ballast tractors were imported from 1970 to the 1980s, and Komatsu dump trucks began to be imported in 1979. Magirus bonneted flatbed trucks and dump trucks were used in 1975 for the construction of the Baikal-Amur Mainline (BAM).|$|R
40|$|Dumping {{is a part}} of a pricing {{strategy}} that is driven by market structures, business cycles or the characteristics of products that are manufactured. It is rarely an anti-competitive practice because most forms of dumping have a clear strategic dimmension and are generally common and beneficial, not only to consumers or an exporting company but also to any economy where domestic price systems are distorted. However, in practice it is underselling that importing-competing firms consider unfair, which reflects their inability or unwillingness to meet the price set by a foreign competitor. Does dumping have any adverse effects? What are the main economic outcomes of this kind of competition? Can dumping be beneficial to the economy of any importing country? The aim of this article is an attempt to answer these questions and present a brief summary of the economic effects of <b>dumping</b> regarding an <b>importing</b> and exporting country economy.

40|$|Since {{its passage}} in 2000, the Byrd Amendment {{has been the}} focal point of ongoing {{disputes}} over the acceptable scope of antidumping laws and fair protection of domestic industry. Most countries possess antidumping laws that allow for duties to be placed on <b>imported</b> <b>dumped</b> goods. The Byrd Amendment seeks to extend such policies by mandating the redistribution of collected antidumping duties to "affected domestic producers" in the form of "offset" payments. The United States was immediately taken to the WTO by 11 countries who contend that the Byrd Amendment constitutes an unfair "double protection" of domestic industry. This article reviews the history of the dispute, negotiations between the parties, the arguments put forth by each party to the WTO, the WTO's findings and rulings, and retaliations taken by the affected countries. Further, this study shows that the effects of dumping are effectively neutralized by the antidumping duties, and that the payment of offsets introduced by the Byrd Amendment is an unnecessary double protection of U. S. domestic industry. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
