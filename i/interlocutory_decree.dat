5000|$|The Emergency Price Control Act engendered {{significant}} controversy regarding {{delegation of}} Congressional power, executive wartime authority, and Congressional control of federal jurisdiction. Much of this {{stemmed from the}} Act's creation of the Emergency Court of Appeals, an Article III court which had all [...] "the powers of a district court {{with respect to the}} jurisdiction conferred on it," [...] except it lacked the ability to issue temporary restraining orders or <b>interlocutory</b> <b>decrees</b> that would stay the effectiveness of any order, regulation, or price schedule issued by the Price Administrator of the Act. The Emergency Court had exclusive jurisdiction to hear complaints relating to actions of the Administrator except those relating to enjoining violations of the act/securing orders of compliance, treble damage actions, and criminal prosecutions for willful violations. For these, the Emergency Court shared jurisdiction with state courts. If anyone disagreed with an action taken by the Administrator (such as a price set), she would file a protest with the Administrator and if that was denied, she had thirty days to file a complaint with the Emergency Court. She could not file in any other district court, and the Emergency Court decisions were appealleable directly to the Supreme Court.|$|R
