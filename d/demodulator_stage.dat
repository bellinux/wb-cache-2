25|$|The {{received}} {{signal is}} now processed by the <b>demodulator</b> <b>stage</b> where the audio signal (or other baseband signal) is recovered and then further amplified. AM demodulation requires the simple rectification of the RF signal (so-called envelope detection), {{and a simple}} RC low pass filter to remove remnants of the intermediate frequency. FM signals may be detected using a discriminator, ratio detector, or phase-locked loop. Continuous wave (Morse code) and single sideband signals require a product detector using a so-called beat frequency oscillator, {{and there are other}} techniques used for different types of modulation. The resulting audio signal (for instance) is then amplified and drives a loudspeaker.|$|E
50|$|An FM radio {{receiver}} usually {{has at least}} one stage of amplification for this purpose. It provides a constant level of signal to the FM <b>demodulator</b> <b>stage,</b> reducing the effect of signal level changes in the output. If two or more signals are received at the same time, a high performance limiter stage can greatly reduce the effect of the weaker signals on the output. This is commonly referred to as the FM capture effect.|$|E

40|$|A {{phase and}} {{polarization}} diversity receiver {{in conjunction with}} balanced detection is operated in a 565 Mbit/s DPSK optical transmission system. A compact bulk optical hybrid provides all optical signals for both diversity operations and for balanced detection in a single unit. A multiplier IC in the <b>demodulator</b> <b>stage</b> gives the required dynamic range for both diversity operations. The receiver is almost completely insensitive to polarization variations...|$|E
