40|$|Abstract: Many {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} in order to accelerate the visualization of large triangle meshes. Level of Detail techniques {{can be used to}} create view-dependent approximations of wide range scenes with low occlusion, such as landscapes. For highly occluded scenes there exist many occlusion culling techniques, which discard occluded parts of the scene before rendering. This can drastically speed up the visualization of such scenes but will not improve rendering of wide non-occluded scenes. In this paper we will combine both acceleration methods. We present a new approach, which combines the benefits of Level of <b>Detail</b> <b>rendering</b> and of Occlusion Culling, in order to minimize their drawbacks. The technique adds occlusion as a view-dependence criterion for Level of <b>Detail</b> <b>rendering</b> and is even able to optimize the refinement of self occluding meshes. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} pinhole camera model that allows {{modulating}} the sampling rate {{over the field}} of view with great flexibility. This flexible pinhole camera or FPC is defined by a viewpoint (i. e. eye) and by a sampling map that specifies the sampling locations on the image plane. The sampling map is constructed from known regions of interest with interactive and automatic approaches. The FPC provides an inexpensive 3 -D projection operation which allows rendering complex datasets quickly, in feed-forward fashion, by projection followed by rasterization. The FPC supports many types of data, including image, height field, geometry, and volume data. The resulting image is a coherent non-uniform sampling (CoNUS) of the dataset that matches the local variation {{of the importance of the}} dataset. We demonstrate the advantages of CoNUS images in the contexts of remote visualization, of focus-plus-context, and of acceleration of expensive rendering effects such as rendering of surface geometric detail and of specular reflections.

40|$|Abstract—Seeding {{streamlines}} in 3 D flow fields {{without considering}} their projections in screen space can produce visually cluttered rendering results. Streamlines will overlap or intersect {{with each other}} in the output image, which makes it difficult for the user to perceive the underlying flow structure. This paper presents a method to control the seeding and generation of streamlines in image space to avoid visual cluttering and allow a more flexible exploration of flow fields. In our algorithm, 2 D images with depth maps generated by a variety of visualization techniques can be used as input from which seeds are placed and streamlines are generated. The density and rendering styles of streamlines can be flexibly controlled based on various criteria to improve visual clarity. With our image space approach, it is straightforward to implement the level of <b>detail</b> <b>rendering,</b> depth peeling, and stylized rendering of streamlines to allow for more effective visualization of 3 D flow fields.

40|$|A new {{screening}} {{technology from}} Artwork Systems, Concentric screening, was evaluated against conventional AM and FM Staccato screening. The main feature of Concentric screening {{is to have}} very small concentric white circles inside AM halftone dots. Test targets were used {{in order to get}} information about different aspects of screening, such as: sensitivity to changes in ink film thickness; color gamut size, particularly for pastel colors; and <b>detail</b> <b>rendering.</b> A comparison was made between AM, FM, and Concentric screening. The results indicate that Concentric tints are more resistant to ink variation than conventional AM screening. Thus, the dot gain stability behavior was closer to FM Screening than to AM screening when ink levels are increased. Regarding color gamut, although there were differences in the expected direction, conclusions are uncertain because of inking variability between the press runs. However, micro-photographs from tints indicate that high resolution screens (FM and Concentric) have a thinner layer of ink on the dots when compared to AM screening. This results in improved color saturation and insensitivity to inking changes. Finally, in terms of contrast and resolution, results show no visually significant differences between the different screenings...|$|E
