5|$|Introduced in HDMI 1.4, HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel (HEAC) adds a {{high-speed}} bidirectional data communication link (HEC) {{and the ability}} to send audio data upstream to the source device (ARC). HEAC utilizes two lines from the connector: the previously unused Reserved pin (called HEAC+) and the <b>Hot</b> <b>Plug</b> Detect pin (called HEAC−). If only ARC transmission is required, a single mode signal using the HEAC+ line can be used, otherwise, HEC is transmitted as a differential signal over the pair of lines, and ARC as a common mode component of the pair.|$|E
25|$|Windows Vista aims {{to simplify}} the detection, configuration, and {{installation}} of external displays and projectors by introducing a standardized setup procedure and interface. The WDDM architecture in Windows Vista enables <b>hot</b> <b>plug</b> detection of external displays and alerts the new Transient Multimon Manager (TMM) when an external display is connected to a system, which then presents an Aero Wizard interface for the configuration and setup of the display. In previous versions of Windows, installation routines for displays often varied based on hardware configurations such as function keys and specific manufacturer requirements, and typically required separate software interfaces. When possible, the TMM also saves user preferences for individual displays to improve mobility scenarios as these preferences can then be restored when a display is reconnected at a different time or location. The aforementioned improvements are intended to enable a display connectivity experience that provides the ease of use observed with plug and play peripherals.|$|E
500|$|The Alternate Mode reconfigures {{the four}} SuperSpeed {{differential}} pairs present in USB-C {{to carry the}} three HDMI TMDS channels and the clock signal. The two Sideband Use pins (SBU1 and SBU2) are used to carry the HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel and the <b>Hot</b> <b>Plug</b> Detect functionality (HEAC+/Utility pin and HEAC−/HPD pin). As {{there are not enough}} reconfigurable pins remaining in USB-C to accommodate the DDC clock (SCL), DDC data (SDA), and CEC – these three signals are bridged between the HDMI source and sink via the USB Power Delivery 2.0 (USB-PD) protocol, and are carried over the USB-C Configuration Channel (CC) wire. This is possible because the cable is [...] electronically marked (i.e., it contains a USB-PD node) that serves to tunnel the DDC and CEC from the source over the Configuration Channel to the node in the cable, these USB-PD messages are received and relayed to the HDMI sink as regenerated DDC (SCL and SDA signals), or CEC signals.|$|E

50|$|The terms <b>hot</b> <b>plug</b> {{and cold}} plug {{can be taken}} to mean two {{different}} things, depending on the context. In a more generic context, <b>hot</b> <b>plug</b> is the ability to add or remove hardware without powering down the system, while cold plug is the inability to do so. In the context of comparing certain hot-pluggable devices, however, <b>hot</b> <b>plug</b> {{can be taken to}} mean the ability of the system to autonomously detect the addition or removal of hardware as it occurs, while cold plug can be taken to mean the ability to add or remove devices without powering down or rebooting the system, but the inability of the system to detect these changes, in which case the system operator would have to tell the system software that the change has occurred.|$|E
50|$|The AMC {{standard}} {{differs from}} other mezzanine card standards such as PCI Mezzanine Card (PMC), PCIexpress Mezzanine Card XMC and FMC - FPGA Mezzanine Card by the 0 degree instead of 90 degree orientation of its connector enabling <b>hot</b> <b>plug</b> of the AMC.|$|E
50|$|Hot {{swapping}} and <b>hot</b> <b>plugging</b> is replacing or adding components {{without stopping}} or {{shutting down the}} system. More specifically, hot swapping describes replacing components without interruption to the system, while <b>hot</b> <b>plugging</b> describes the addition of components that would expand the system without significant interruption to {{the operation of the}} system. Once the appropriate software is installed on the computer, a user can plug and unplug the component without rebooting. A well-known example of this functionality is the Universal Serial Bus (USB) that allows users to add or remove peripheral components such as a mouse, keyboard, or printer.|$|R
5000|$|A {{glow plug}} engine must be {{operated}} {{with the correct}} glow plug temperature. Large engines can operate with lower temperatures, while smaller engines radiate heat to the air more quickly and require a <b>hotter</b> glow <b>plug</b> to maintain the correct temperature for ignition. The ambient temperature also dictates the best glow plug temperature; in cold weather, <b>hotter</b> <b>plugs</b> are needed. Since glow plug engines are air-cooled, an engine that [...] "runs hot" [...] can sometimes benefit from a lower plug temperature, although this may cause rougher idling and difficulty in tuning. The operating speed of the engine must also be considered; if the engine is to run at consistently high RPM, such as with an airplane or a car on a mostly straight track, a lower plug temperature is more efficient. If the engine is to operate at lower RPM, combustion will not heat the engine as much, and a <b>hotter</b> <b>plug</b> is required.|$|R

(A too <b>hot</b> <b>plug</b> may, however, indirectly lead to a runaway pre-ignition condition that can increase engine temperature.) Rather, {{the main effect of}} a [...] "hot" [...] or [...] "cold" [...] plug is to affect the temperature of the tip of the spark plug.|$|E

5000|$|As no {{commercial}} {{devices were}} released supporting ZIPI, the sufficiency of MIDI for most applications {{and the introduction}} of the [...] "FireWire" [...] (IEEE1394) as the alternative physical layer soon led to the practical demise of the project. ZIPI web site at CNMAT asserts that IEEE1394 [...] "supersedes ZIPI in every respect," [...] mainly because it has simpler interface requirements: it does not require a hub, supports <b>hot</b> <b>plugging</b> (devices may be added or removed more conveniently), and includes an isolated power distribution scheme.|$|R
5000|$|It {{soon became}} clear that the PCMCIA card {{standard}} needed expansion to support [...] "smart" [...] I/O cards to address the emerging need for fax, modem, LAN, harddisk and floppy disk cards. It also needed interrupt facilities and <b>hot</b> <b>plugging,</b> which required the definition of new BIOS and operating system interfaces. This led to the introduction of release 2.0 of the PCMCIA standard and JEIDA 4.1 in September 1991, which saw corrections and expansion with Card Services (CS) in the PCMCIA 2.1 standard in November 1992.|$|R
50|$|A.b was {{an attempt}} to {{reproduce}} these qualities in a new standard for the PC and workstation market. It had two additional advantages over ADB; <b>hot</b> <b>plugging</b> (plug-n-play) and the ability for the devices to have their own host controllers so devices could be plugged together without the need for a host computer to control the communications. Philips also suggested that the ability to plug any A.b device into any computer meant that people with special devices, like mice designed for people with disabilities, might carry their device from machine to machine.|$|R
50|$|In May 2007, version 2.0 of {{the driver}} (xorg-video-intel) was released, which added support for the 965GM chipset.

This version added support for automatic video mode detection and selection, monitor <b>hot</b> <b>plug,</b> dynamic extended and merged desktops and per-monitor screen rotation. These features are built into the X.Org 7.3 X server release and will eventually be supported across most of the open source X.Org video drivers.

50|$|Serial ATA (SATA, {{abbreviated}} from Serial AT Attachment) is {{a computer}} bus interface that connects host bus adapters to mass storage devices such as hard disk drives, optical drives, and solid-state drives. Serial ATA succeeded the older Parallel ATA (PATA) standard, offering several advantages over the older interface: reduced cable size and cost (seven conductors instead of 40 or 80), native hot swapping, faster data transfer through higher signaling rates, and more efficient transfer through an (optional) I/O queuing protocol. Although, a number of <b>hot</b> <b>plug</b> PATA offering were first invented and marketed by Core International {{beginning in the late}} 1980s for the Micro Channel architecture bus controllers.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{slightly}} differing {{meanings of}} the term hot swapping. It may refer only {{to the ability to}} add or remove hardware without powering down the system, while the system software may have to be notified by the user of the event in order to cope with it. Examples include RS-232 and lower-end SCSI devices. This is sometimes called cold plugging. However, if the system can detect and respond to addition or removal of hardware, it is referred to as true <b>hot</b> <b>plugging.</b> Examples include USB, FireWire and higher-end SCSI devices.|$|R
5000|$|The {{release of}} Windows 98 {{was preceded by}} a notable press {{demonstration}} at COMDEX in April, 1998.

The method integrates well with the TTP/A protocol and is implementable in standard TTP/A slave and master nodes. Even though configuration of new components is normally not time critical, our method inherites a deterministic timing behavior from the TTP/A protocol and can be used in parallel with real-time traffic for <b>hot</b> <b>plug</b> and play of new nodes...|$|E
