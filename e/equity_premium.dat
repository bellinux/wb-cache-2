25|$|A {{specific}} {{example of}} this criticism appears in some explanations of the <b>equity</b> <b>premium</b> puzzle. It is argued that the cause is entry barriers (both practical and psychological) and that returns between stocks and bonds should equalize as electronic resources open up the stock market to more traders. In response, others contend that most personal investment funds are managed through superannuation funds, minimizing {{the effect of these}} putative entry barriers. In addition, professional investors and fund managers seem to hold more bonds than one would expect given return differentials.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} {{discount}} rate is subjective. A smaller rate values future generations equally {{with the current}} generation. Larger rates (e.g. a market rate of return) reflects humans' attraction to time inconsistency—valuing money that they receive today more than money {{they get in the}} future. The choice makes a large difference in assessing interventions with long-term effects. One issue is the <b>equity</b> <b>premium</b> puzzle, in which long-term returns on equities may be rather higher than they should be. If so then arguably market rates of return should not be used to determine a discount rate, as doing so would have the effect of undervaluing the distant future (e.g. climate change).|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to determine the level of implied <b>equity</b> risk <b>premiums</b> from two models and to analyse their explanatory power in terms of future realized <b>equity</b> risk <b>premiums.</b> The paper studies a new method to estimate implied premiums and validates the results by a comparison to an established model. Luoma and Sahlström (2009) presented their model to estimate implied <b>equity</b> risk <b>premiums</b> by looking at an earn back period calculated from analysts' earnings forecasts, the current market price and the risk-free rate. Their model has not been empirically tested before. To evaluate the validity of the numbers obtained from their model, a similar test is executed employing an established model presented by Claus and Thomas (2001) that estimates implied premiums by using book values and earnings forecasts. The sample firms are constituents of the S&P 500 index that is based on the market capitalizations of 500 largest companies publicly traded in the U. S. stock market. The dataset consist of a sample of 6710 firm-year observations including 824 different firms during 1985 to 2010. Using the firm-year observations, implied <b>equity</b> risk <b>premiums</b> are calculated for the two models. To gain understanding on the explanatory power of the two methods in terms of future realized <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium,</b> cross-correlations and regressions are built. A self-financing trading strategy is employed to determine the economic significance of the implied <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium.</b> I find that the implied <b>equity</b> risk <b>premiums</b> from the two models are below the historical <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium</b> estimates. Implied <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium</b> from Luoma-Sahlström model is 2. 35 percent. Implied premium obtained from the Claus-Thomas model is 4. 56 percent. Analysis shows that the both models have statistically significant explanatory power. There is a positive link between implied premiums and future realized <b>equity</b> <b>premiums.</b> The significance is stronger in the Luoma-Sahlström model. A self-financing trading strategy built to capitalize on the explanatory power shows that portfolios containing stocks {{with a high level of}} implied <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium</b> outperform the portfolios containing stocks with a low level of implied <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium</b> by 2. 0 percent.

This <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium</b> is determined by GDP volatility and price inflation. In a lesser extent, the share of U.

40|$|Academic {{research}} relies {{extensively on}} macroeconomic variables to forecast the U.

Our paper fills this gap by comparing the predictive ability of technical indicators with that of macroeconomic variables. Technical indicators display statistically and economically significant in-sample and out-of-sample predictive power, matching or exceeding that of macroeconomic variables. Furthermore, technical indicators and macroeconomic variables provide complementary information over the business cycle: technical indicators better detect the typical decline in the <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium</b> near business-cycle peaks, whereas macroeconomic variables more readily pick up the typical rise in the <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium</b> near cyclical troughs. Consistent with this behavior, we show that combining information from both technical indicators and macroeconomic variables significantly improves <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium</b> forecasts versus using either type of information alone. Overall, the substantial counter cyclical fluctuations in the <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium</b> appear well captured by the combined information in technical indicators and macroeconomic variables...|$|R

40|$|Examinations of long-run {{trends in}} the stock market usually {{concentrate}} on markets in the United States. This paper builds on these studies by examining the <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium</b> in Canada over the 1923 - 2001 period. Two methodologies are used to gauge the expectations of investors with regard to the <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium.</b> The first is the one developed and implemented by Arnott and Bernstein (2002) for the United States. The second methodology estimates the <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium</b> implicit in the discount rate that equates forecasted dividend payments to present market valuations. The empirical results show that actual risk premiums either met or exceeded the future <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium</b> expectations of Canadian investors over the studied time period. On balance, it would appear that investors realized more than they expected in terms of risk premium over the studied period, although this excess {{does not appear to be}} as pronounced as that found by Arnott and Bernstein (2002) for the United States. Moreover, evidence is presented that the effect of the stock exchange (namely, the Toronto Stock Exchange and Montreal Exchange) used to measure stock returns is important when investors form their expectations regarding future <b>equity</b> <b>premiums.</b> However, the latter result may be due to the lower quality of the data available for the Montreal Exchange...|$|R

50|$|Edward C. Prescott and Rajnish Mehra first {{proposed}} the <b>Equity</b> <b>Premium</b> Puzzle in 1985. In 1988, Rietz suggested that large and infrequent economic shocks {{could explain the}} <b>equity</b> <b>premium</b> (the premium of securities over fixed income assets). However, it was not deemed feasible at the time, because it seemed that such events were too rare and could not occur in reality. The theory was forgotten until 2005, when Robert Barro provided evidence of nations {{from around the world}} from the 19th and 20th century, showing that these events were possible and have happened. Since his papers, others have submitted different ideas regarding rare disasters' impact on other economic phenomenon. However, many economists remain skeptical of how much rare disasters really explain the <b>equity</b> <b>premium</b> and Mehra still expresses doubt as to the validity of the theory.|$|E

40|$|There {{are very}} few {{estimates}} of a time-varying <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium</b> based on models that satisfy a no-arbitrage condition. The main aim {{of this paper is}} to estimate the US and UK equity risk premia implied by a number of well-known asset pricing models using monthly data for 1975 - 2001. The models include consumption-based CAPM with power utility, the Epstein-Zin general equilibrium model with time non-separable preferences, CAPM, and the SDF model. We show that most of the theoretical models of the <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium</b> that have been proposed in the literature are special cases the SDF model. We explain why some of them are unable to do this as formulated. In addition to examining existing theories of the <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium,</b> we use the SDF model to generate new theories. We find that macroeconomic variables not previously considered, and not consistent with standard general equilibrium theory, such as production, appear to be priced for the <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium.</b> This suggests that traditional general equilibrium considerations may not be the sole explanation for the equity risk premium; other short-term factors associated with pure price risk may also be involved. A related, and rapidly growing, literature adopts a more statistical approach. It focusses on the empirical relation between the return on equity (or the Sharpe ratio) and return volatility. We use SDF theory to show that this relation is misconceived. The reason for the absence of estimates of the <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium</b> is the difficulty of estimating it. Most of the empirical evidence on these asset pricing models is based on calibration, or the estimation of the Euler equation by GMM, neither of which delivers an estimate of the risk premium. We use a new empirical approach that does produce estimates of the risk premium and allows tests of the theories. As a result we provide the first estimates of the <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium</b> for some of these models. We then use our estimates to investigate the importance of different components of the <b>equity</b> risk <b>premium</b> including, amongst others, return volatility. ...|$|R
