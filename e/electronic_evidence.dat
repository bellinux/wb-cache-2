2500|$|On May 6, 2015, the NFL {{published}} a 243-page report regarding the deflation of footballs {{used in the}} previous season's AFC Championship Game. The report concluded that, more likely than not, Brady was at least generally aware of the intentional deflation. On May 11, Brady was suspended for four games by the NFL for his involvement based on [...] "substantial and credible evidence" [...] that Brady knew Patriots employees were deflating footballs and that he failed {{to cooperate with the}} investigators. On May 11, Troy Vincent—NFL Executive Vice President of Football Operations—penned a letter to Brady that stated in part: [...] "Your actions as set forth in the report clearly constitute conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in the game of professional football." [...] Vincent's letter further stated: [...] "With respect to your particular involvement, the report established that there is substantial and credible evidence to conclude you were at least generally aware of the actions of the Patriots' employees involved in the deflation of the footballs and that it was unlikely that their actions were done without your knowledge. Moreover, the report documents your failure to cooperate fully and candidly with the investigation, including by refusing to produce any relevant <b>electronic</b> <b>evidence</b> (emails, texts, etc.), despite being offered extraordinary safeguards by the investigators to protect unrelated personal information, and by providing testimony that the report concludes was not plausible and contradicted by other evidence."

40|$|Non-repudiation {{is one of}} most {{important}} security services in electronic transactions. It provides protection from denial {{by one of the}} entities involved in a communication of parties participating in all or part of communication. In practice, a non-repudiation property is an important evidence for accounting for or tracking a system or tracking to illegal connections. However, a password-based communication system does not provide the non-repudiation property for connection evidence. In this paper, a dynamic session key policy (DSKP) with a non-repudiation signature scheme for secure mobile networks authentication is proposed. The proposed non-repudiation signature scheme is a mixed method which combines a one-way hash function and a traditional digital signature technique. Since computational cost usually is an important issue in a mobile environment, the proposed scheme can provide additional non-repudiation properties satisfying the future needs of <b>electronic</b> <b>evidences</b> such as accounting, auditing, logging, and tracking of connections to a mobile network system at the expense of a small additional computing load for the mobile devices. Besides, it can also achieve the same security services from a security and performance analysis point of view. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
