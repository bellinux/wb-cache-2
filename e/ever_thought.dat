5|$|William was re-elected to York after Murdac's {{death in}} 1153. When William {{attempted}} to enter York on 9 May 1154, Robert, along with Osbert de Bayeux, tried to prevent his entry, but their attempt was unsuccessful and they {{then went to}} Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and appealed in vain against William's actions. It is possible that Robert feared that William would remove Robert from the deanship. After William's death, Robert, once more acting with Osbert, pressured the cathedral chapter of York to elect Stephen's choice of Roger de Pont L'Évêque as the new Archbishop of York. Osbert was later accused of poisoning William, and was deprived of his office and clerical status when he could not clear himself from the accusation. Although Robert was associated with Osbert's opposition to William, {{there is no evidence}} that Robert was <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> to have been involved in the possible poisoning of William.|$|E

25|$|It {{is unclear}} whether the {{recording}} industry <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> that revenue from royalties would compensate for revenues lost to the first generation copying authorized by the AHRA. Given their willingness to block all distribution of all digital audio recording media and devices in the United States, {{that the combination of}} SCMS and the price premium imposed by royalties was intended to cripple the market. It is also possible that given a new technology, and the Act's unprecedented provisions (royalties, legislative mandates for copy protection), they could not predict the impact of the AHRA on adoption of the new technology.|$|E
25|$|After feeling jilted by Bianca {{a second}} time in what she {{believes}} to be Bianca having chosen Babe as a lover, she enters into a romantic relationship with bad boy Jonathan Lavery. Maggie, unaware when finding Bianca in bed with Babe earlier {{that it was a}} ploy to trap JR into confessing that he framed Jamie, wraps herself deeply into Jonathan's life. It is not long before Jamie goes on the run with Babe, leaving Maggie without a roommate. She has Jonathan move in with her. Everything goes well with Jonathan at first, their relationship seeming to be more about sex in the beginning. Jonathan is even aware of Maggie's sexual confusion and asks her how she could have <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> she was gay. Maggie says she was wrong. Although Bianca and Maggie share a second kiss together, Maggie stresses to Bianca that she is not a lesbian. Things begin to fall apart for Jonathan and Maggie's romance when she finds him destroying the shirt Bianca wore the night Miranda was born. Jonathan convinces Maggie that the shirt would have provided the evidence needed to prove that the Cambias heir, Ethan, is really a Cambias, and would have resulted in Jonathan's brother, the current heir to the Cambias fortune, Ryan, to lose everything. Maggie covers for him with Bianca.|$|E

500|$|Like most {{politicians}} of his time, Harding accepted that patronage and graft {{would be used}} to repay political favors. He arranged for his sister Mary (who was legally blind) to be appointed asa teacher at the Ohio School for the Blind, although there were better-qualified candidates. In another trade, he offered publicity in his newspaper in exchange for free railroad passes for himself and his family. According to Sinclair, [...] "it is doubtful that Harding <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> there was anything dishonest in accepting the perquisites of position or office. Patronage and favors seemed the normal reward for party service in the days of Hanna." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{widespread}} Arab {{campaign to}} protest against presumed Jewish intentions and designs to {{take possession of}} the Al Aqsa Mosque swept the country and a [...] "Society for the Protection of the Muslim Holy Places" [...] was established. The Vaad Leumi responding to these Arab fears declared {{in a statement that}} [...] "We herewith declare emphatically and sincerely that no Jew has <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> of encroaching upon the rights of Moslems over their own Holy places, but our Arab brethren should also recognise the rights of Jews in regard to the places in Palestine which are holy to them." [...] The committee also demanded that the British administration expropriate the wall for the Jews.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Cogman described some of the thought process he had when writing the reunion between Samwell and his family, saying, [...] "As much as Sam has gone through, I love exploring those family dynamics. His mother and sister and brother are all fundamentally decent people but his father is just a cold hearted bastard {{when it comes to}} his distant son. There's a painful part of the scene where his father just unloads on him and tells him every hateful thing he <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> about him and Sam can't defend himself. We found that fascinating – Sam has killed a man, he's killed a White Walker, he's emerged as such a great hero, but he still can't stand up to his dad." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{plot and}} nature of the episode bear a {{striking}} resemblance to the film Predator (1987), in which a creature that is able to perfectly camouflage itself, {{almost to the point of}} complete invisibility, stalks several humans in a dense jungle. While camping in the woods overnight, Scully sings [...] "Joy to the World" [...] by Three Dog Night while Mulder rests so that he can know she is awake and on guard. Originally, Scully was supposed to sing [...] "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry", a 1949 country song by Hank Williams. However, series creator Chris Carter requested something more [...] "off the wall". Spotnitz, instead, chose [...] "Joy to the World" [...] and later said, [...] "in retrospect, the song was perfect". When talking, Mulder admits that the only time he has <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> about [...] "seriously dying" [...] was at the Ice Capades.|$|E
500|$|In a {{positive}} review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau highlighted the band's {{ability to create}} unexpected noises, which he described as [...] "marks of flesh-and-blood creatures thinking and feeling things neither you nor they have <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> or felt before. If they can't quite put those things into words, that's what unexpected noises are for." [...] Unlike previous Sonic Youth albums, Experimental Jet Set was not ranked in the Top 40 of The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1994, but Christgau placed it at No. 3 in his own [...] "Dean's List". In a retrospective review for About.com, 90s rock expert Melissa Bobbitt wrote: [...] "Though {{it might not be}} as universally celebrated as 1988's Daydream Nation or Dirty, this record represented the triumphant rise of the Alternative Nation and its progressive nature." [...] In 2014, Guitar World placed Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star at No. 44 in their [...] "Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994" [...] list.|$|E
500|$|In the song's first verse, [...] "Belle articulates how her {{attraction}} to [...] stems from his shut-off demeanor," [...] singing, [...] "There's something sweet/And almost kind/But he was mean/And he was coarse and unrefined/But now he's dear/And so unsure/I wonder why I didn't see it there before." [...] The Beast's verse reads, [...] "when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw." [...] According to Laurence E. MacDonald, {{author of the}} book The Invisible Art of Film Music: A Comprehensive History, Benson [...] "shocked many filmgoers with his richly resonant baritone." [...] Finally, Belle sings the song's bridge, which reads, [...] "New and a bit alarming/Who'd have <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> that this could be?/True, that he's no Prince Charming/But there's something in him that I simply didn't see." [...] According to the Los Angeles Times, by the end of [...] "Something There", [...] "the audience understands what Belle and Beast feel and how disconcerting those emotions seem." ...|$|E

500|$|TJ of Neon Limelight gave a mixed review, {{calling it}} [...] "sassy" [...] but [...] "would work better {{for an artist}} {{at least a decade}} younger than Aguilera", with its [...] "painfully {{adolescent}} lyrics". Becky Bain of Idolator wrote, [...] "It's one of those pandering songs that will no doubt have young girls singing along, particularly the chorus, but it's a lazy one that leaves rubs us the wrong way." [...] Bradley Stern from MuuMuse named it a [...] "filler, including the noisy, childish chant." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commented that [...] "it's the kind of trite glitter-disco might've dispensed", while comparing it to Spice Girls' songs. Eric Henderson gave to the song a negative review, writing, [...] "Considering 'I Hate Boys' is closer than I <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> Christina would ever come to recording a Daphne Aguilera track, it's ironically also one of many tracks on Bionic that sound tailor-made to accompany the opening credits of Johnny Weir's forthcoming reality show." ...|$|E
500|$|As a final {{tribute to}} Pauline and Wendy Richard, the BBC aired a special {{television}} programme, EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline, which provided an emotional {{look back at}} Pauline's pivotal storylines during her time in Walford. It also reunited Wendy Richard with prior cast-mates Todd Carty and James Alexandrou (Mark and Martin respectively), and featured character commentary and tributes from television critics and EastEnders actors such as Anna Wing and Pam St. Clement (Lou and Pat). During the programme—which aired on New Year's Day, 2007—Wendy Richard reflected upon how [...] "proud" [...] she was of her character, commenting: [...] "Pauline had everything in life thrown at her and I think she coped with it very well. It showed how people deal with their problems... She wasn't always grumpy... she did have lots of laughs, but sadly people don't seem to remember that, which is a shame... they still harp on about her wearing her cardigans and Pauline stopped wearing cardigans three years after EastEnders started. She is a good woman, she's a kind woman, a loving woman and all she <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> about was her family. That {{was the most important}} thing in her life." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} {{scouting}} handbook, Aids to Scouting (1899), Baden-Powell published {{many of the}} lessons he learned from Burnham and this book was later used by boys' groups {{as a guide to}} outdoor fun. At the urging of several youth leaders, Baden-Powell decided to adapt his scouting handbook specifically to training boys. While Baden-Powell went on to refine the concept of Scouting, publish Scouting for Boys (1908), and become the founder of the international Scouting movement, Burnham has been called the movement's father. James E. West, Chief Scout Executive for the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), summarized Burnham's historical relevance to Scouting: [...] "There is an especial significance for those of us in Scouting in this man's list, for he was engaged for this work by Lord Baden Powell, who was then connected with the British Army in Africa, and who had unbounded admiration for the scouting methods of Frederick Burnham. So these two pioneers, each of whom was to have such immeasurable influence in restoring the old traditions of American youth, met in Africa, years before the Scouting movement was <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> of." ...|$|E
