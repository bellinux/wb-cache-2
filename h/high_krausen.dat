A very few breweries still use wooden vats for fermentation but wood {{is difficult to}} keep clean and infection-free and must be repitched often, perhaps yearly. After <b>high</b> <b>kr√§usen,</b> {{the point at which}} fermentation is most active and copious foam is produced, a valve known in German as the spundapparat may be put on the tanks to allow the carbon dioxide produced by the yeast to naturally carbonate the beer. This bung device can regulate the pressure to produce different types of beer; greater pressure produces a more carbonated beer.|$|E
