By 08:00, Africaine was a dismasted hull and Corbet was dead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> of the ship, although the exact manner of his death was to cause lasting controversy. By 10:00, Boadicea had been joined by Otter and Staunch and bore down on the French ships and their prize, so that by 15:30 Bouvet was persuaded to abandon Africaine and tow the damaged Iphigénie back to Port Napoleon. By 17:00, Boadicea pulled alongside Africaine and the French prize crew surrendered. Rowley later reported that a number of British sailors leaped into the sea at his approach and swam to Boadicea, requesting that they be allowed to pursue the French ships in the hope of capturing one.|$|E
5|$|The Arbiter {{is saved}} by the tentacled {{creature}} and meets the Master Chief <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> of the installation. The creature, Gravemind, {{is the leader of}} the Flood on Installation 05. The Gravemind reveals to the Arbiter that the Great Journey would destroy Flood, humans, and Covenant altogether, and sends both the Arbiter and Master Chief to different places to stop Halo's activation. The Master Chief is teleported into High Charity, where a civil war has broken out among the Covenant; In Amber Clad crashes into the city, and Cortana realizes that Gravemind used them as a distraction to infest In Amber Clad and spread the Flood. As the parasite overruns the city, consuming the Prophet of Mercy in the process, the Prophet of Truth orders Tartarus to take Keyes, Johnson, and Guilty Spark to Halo's control room and activate the ring. The Master Chief follows Truth aboard a Forerunner ship leaving the city; Cortana remains behind to destroy High Charity and Halo if Tartarus succeeds in activating the ring.|$|E

25|$|A {{shocking}} {{series of}} incidents {{occurred in the}} locality of Hessilhead, starting on 19 July 1576 when the Lady of Hessilhead slapped one Robert Kent, servant to Gabriel, brother of John Montgomerie.

John advised him to seek revenge {{and the next morning}} Gabriel and Robert gained entry into Hessilhead Castle where they found the lady alone, upon which they grabbed her by the hair, pulled her onto the floor, kicked her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowels,</b> and bruised her shamefully. Gabriel intended to shoot the Laird, however the whole household was now awake and the two only just managed to escape by stealing a horse and locking the castle gate from the outside. The Laird, Hew Montgomerie, hastened to Thirdpart where John and Gabriel came out with pistols and drawn swords and attacked Hew Montgomerie, injuring him on various parts of his body and leaving him for dead. He was rescued by some neighbours who took him to Hessilhead castle where he recovered from his wounds.|$|E

25|$|Douglas {{argued that}} the {{tabernacle}} ran horizontally toward the most sacred area, Mount Sinai went up vertically to the summit, and the sacrificial pile started with the head underneath {{and went up to}} the entrails, and one can interpret each by reference to the others. Douglas noted that in mystical thought, “upper” and “inner” can be equivalent. The pattern is always there throughout creation, with God in the depths or on the heights of everything. Likening the tabernacle to a body, the innards corresponded to the Holy of Holies, for the Bible locates the emotions and thought in the innermost parts of the body; the loins are wrung with remorse or grief; God scrutinizes the innermost part; compassion resides <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowels.</b> The Tabernacle was associated with creation, and creation with fertility, implying that the innermost part of the Tabernacle was a Divine nuptial chamber, depicting the union between God and Israel. Douglas concluded that the summit of the mountain was the abode of God, below was the cloudy region that only Moses could enter, and the lower slopes were where the priests and congregation waited, and analogously, the order of placing the parts of the animal on the altar marked out three zones on the carcass, the suet set around and below the diaphragm corresponding to the cloud girdling the middle of the mountain.|$|E

500|$|The Flood make {{a return}} {{appearance}} in Halo 2, first after being released on a Forerunner facility near Halo, {{and again on}} Installation 05 or [...] "Delta Halo". The Flood on Delta Halo are led by the Gravemind, a massive creature that dwells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> of the ring. Gravemind brings together the Master Chief and the Arbiter and tasks them with stopping the Covenant leadership from activating the ring. In the meantime, Gravemind infests the human ship In Amber Clad and crashes it into the Covenant space station of High Charity. Once there, the Flood sweep through the city, before Gravemind appears and questions Cortana. As the Flood spread across Halo and infect High Charity in , the Covenant form a blockade {{in an effort to}} prevent the parasite from leaving its prison.|$|E

500|$|The Gravemind is a parasitic, hive mind {{intelligence}} in the Halo universe. While only one Gravemind is ever seen in the games, the title {{is given to the}} final stage of Flood evolution, in which the Flood becomes a superorganism. [...] The Flood is a highly-infectious parasite which is released several times during Halos story. The Chief and the Arbiter (Thel'Vadam, during the course of Halo 2 and Halo 3) are captured during their separate missions on Delta Halo, or Installation 05, by a Gravemind, which resides <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> of the ancient Forerunner ringworld, where the Flood creature forges an alliance between the two foes in order to stop the activation of the ringworld — an event which would destroy all sentient life, and, therefore, starve the Flood. The character is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.|$|E
500|$|Gravemind (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) {{is one of}} {{the primary}} antagonists in the Halo series. The Gravemind is a large, sentient {{creature}} of Flood origin, created by the parasite to serve as its central intelligence once a critical biomass has been achieved. It was introduced during the events of Halo 2, where the creature saves both the Master Chief and Arbiter from their deaths, bringing the two face to face <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> of Delta Halo. Gravemind reveals to the Arbiter that the [...] "sacred rings" [...] are actually weapons of last resort; a fact the Master Chief confirms. In order to stop Halo from being fired, Gravemind teleports the Master Chief and Arbiter to separate locations, but also uses them as a distraction; Gravemind infests the human ship In Amber Clad, and uses it to invade the Covenant city of High Charity. Capturing Cortana, Gravemind brings High Charity to the Ark in an effort to stop the High Prophet of Truth from activating the Halo network. Although the Master Chief destroys High Charity, Gravemind survives the blast and attempts to rebuild itself on the incomplete Halo. When Halo is activated, Gravemind accepts his fate, but insists that the activation of the ring will only slow, not stop, the Flood. In Halo Wars 2: Awakening the Nightmare, the Gravemind's warning is validated when the Banished inadvertently unleash a number of Flood infection forms that survived Halo's activation. It is also mentioned in the game's menu that while the Gravemind's [...] "most recent physical avatar" [...] was destroyed by the Master Chief, it is [...] "only {{a matter of time before}} it rises again".|$|E
500|$|Another {{established}} literary trope {{found in}} the plot of Conan the Barbarian {{is the concept of}} death, followed by a journey into the underworld, and rebirth. [...] Donald E. Palumbo, the Language and Humanities Chair at Lorain County Community College, noted that like most other sword and sorcery films, Conan used the motif of underground journeys to reinforce the themes of death and rebirth. [...] According to him, the first scene to involve all three is after Conan's liberation: his flight from wild dogs sends him tumbling into a tomb where he finds a sword that lets him cut off his chains and stand with newfound power. [...] In the later parts of the film, Conan experiences two underground journeys where death abounds: <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> of the Tower of Serpents where he has to fight a giant snake and {{in the depths of the}} Temple of Set where the cultists feast on human flesh while Doom transforms himself into a large serpent. [...] Whereas Valeria dies and comes back from the dead (albeit briefly), Conan's ordeal from his crucifixion was symbolic. [...] Although the barbarian's crucifixion might evoke Christian imagery, associations of the film with the religion are roundly rejected. [...] Milius stated his film is full of pagan ideas, a sentiment supported by film critics such as Elley and Jack Kroll. [...] George Aichele, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and Religion at Adrian College, suggested the filmmaker's intent with the crucifixion scene was pure marketing: to tease the audience with religious connotations. [...] He, however, suggested that Conan's story can be viewed as an analogy of Christ's life and vice versa. [...] Nigel Andrews, a film critic, saw any connections to Christianity related more to the making of the film. The crucifixion is also reminiscent of Odin being nailed to Yggdrasil.|$|E

30|$|An {{elevation}} of the blood ammonia levels may result from the diversion of the urinary stream to the intact intestine, which provides an additional amount of ammonia that must be absorbed, especially when there is urine stasis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowel.</b> Urea <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> is converted by urea-splitting bacteria to form ammonia.

Even with a normal liver function, urease-producing bacteria may form large amounts of ammonia, thereby, leading to hyperammonemia.|$|R

500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has toured {{numerous}} places in the world, including Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS Titanic in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> of the ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came out that we found out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone," [...] said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.|$|E
2500|$|Assange {{stated that}} he {{registered}} the domain leaks.org in 1999, but [...] "didn't do anything with it."

Everyone's overseas phone calls are or may soon be tapped, transcribed and archived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> of an unaccountable foreign spy agency." [...] Systematic abuse of technology by governments against fundamental freedoms of world citizens remained an abiding concern— {{more than a decade}} later, in the introduction to Cypherpunks (2012), Assange summarised: [...] "the Internet, our greatest tool for emancipation, has been transformed into the most dangerous facilitator of totalitarianism we have ever seen".|$|E
2500|$|After informing {{him of his}} fate, the Devil {{explains}} to Sam that he must serve as his bounty hunter (or [...] "Reaper"), tracking down souls that have escaped from Hell and sending them back using his new powers (which include telekinesis) and [...] "vessels", varied objects {{said to have been}} hand-made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> of perdition by the iniquitous and the vile. Vessels appear inside a long wooden box sent for Sam to open (with the Italian inscription [...] "Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch'entrate" [...] , as was written on the entrance to Hell in Dante's Inferno), and are specially designed for each job.
