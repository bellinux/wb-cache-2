50|$|There {{has been}} {{organized}} Islamic religious life in Macedonia {{since the time}} when Ottoman Empire started administering this region. All Muslims {{who lived in the}} Ottoman Empire were part of the Muslim community headed by the sultan, who replaced the role of the caliph. During the reign of the Sultan Murad II the competences of the caliph were transferred to the grand mufti. Since then, the grand mufti was titled Sheykhul-Islam and was considered the highest religious authority within the Ottoman Empire. However, every region inhabited by Muslims had its own mufti, who was <b>in</b> <b>lower</b> <b>position</b> than the Sheykhul-Islam. After the First World War, Macedonia was under the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The Islamic community of the Kingdom was headed by Reis-ul-ulama, whose office was in Sarajevo. The Reis-ul-ulama responsibility was to organize the Islamic Religious life in Bosnia and Hezegovina, Croatia and Slovenia, whereas in Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia and Kosovo the Islamic Religious life was organized by the Supreme Mufti (that was in a lower position than the Reis-ul-ulama), whose office was in Belgrade.After the creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the competences of the Supreme Mufti were transferred to the Ulama Majlis in Skopje and the competences of the Reis-ul-ulama were transferred to the Ulama Majlis in Sarajevo. The newly formed Ulama Majlises formed the Rijaset of Islamic Community with its head office in Sarajevo. After the Second World War the Islamic Community of Macedonia became part of the Islamic Community of Yugoslav Federation (Rijaset), with its office in Sarajevo. After the Breakup of Yugoslavia and the independence of Macedonia, this community continues to act as an independent religious community in Macedonia, based in Skopje.|$|E

40|$|There {{is no need}} to {{say that}} as a half of the human population, women play an {{unmatched}} Role in the developing process of each country, but global statistics indicate that they are <b>in</b> <b>lower</b> <b>position</b> in comparison with men. Women are faced with various discriminations in different areas, such as education, employment, health, nourishment, politics, family life and individual and social freedom which have caused them to get less individual and social progressive opportunities than men.

The achieved results indicate that in Iran labor market, women are not in an entirely desirable opposition, especially considering some other social components such as education, fertility rate, marriage age and so on, while the changing process had promoted the situation in favor of them. But the acceleration of these changes is low and the necessity of more drastic changes is clearly understandable.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} gender earnings gaps in Hong Kong {{using the}} 2006 by-census data. To explore {{the sources of}} gender earnings gaps, we decompose the gaps using the method proposed by Machado and Mata (2005). We have three major findings. First, gender earnings gaps are larger both <b>in</b> <b>lower</b> <b>positions</b> and <b>in</b> higher positions in the earnings distribution. Both the "glass ceiling effect" and the "sticky floor effect" exist in Hong Kong. Second, gender earnings gaps in higher positions are much explained by gender differentials in productivity-related characteristics; however, gender earnings gaps <b>in</b> <b>lower</b> <b>positions</b> are barely explained by these characteristics. Third, the effect of occupational segregation on gender earnings gaps depends on specific positions in the earnings distribution. <b>In</b> <b>lower</b> <b>positions,</b> occupational segregation {{is not a big}} problem and has little impact on gender earnings gaps; in higher positions, however, occupational segregation favors male workers and enlarges gender earnings gaps.

40|$|Two {{recombinant}} {{inbred line}} (RIL) populations, one {{derived from a}} cross between Zhongyouzao 8 (indica) and Toyonishiki (japonica) and the other from a cross between Qishanzhan (indica) and Akihikari (japonica), were grown in Liaoning and Sichuan Provinces, China, to study the panicle type index (PTI, the ratio {{of a number of}} node position on panicle axis where the secondary branch with the most numerous secondary branch grains is located to the number of primary branches) and its relationships with subspecies characteristics and yield traits. With continuous distribution of PTI and numerous of lines with different PTIs in the progenies, indica-japonica hybridization could be a method for breeding cultivars with ideal panicle type. PTI was significantly influenced by environments, with a significant decrease from Liaoning to Sichuan. A significantly negative correlation was found between PTI and most of subspecies characteristics. PTI varied remarkably with different subspecies types. As a whole, it showed a trend of indica (H) >indicalinous (H') >japonicalinous (K') >japonica (K). However, it is not appropriate to regard PTI as a parameter for subspecies classification in rice because it was recombined in the filial generations of cross between indica and japonica rice. The negative correlations were found between PTI and most of panicle characteristics, as well as yield-related traits. Based on PTI, most of lines from the two populations were middle dominant panicle type (the number of grains on the secondary branch is numerous in middle position of the panicle) and lower dominant panicle type (the number of grains on the secondary branch is numerous <b>in</b> <b>lower</b> <b>position</b> of the panicle and becomes less towards the top of panicle) with significant yield advantages...|$|E
40|$|Studying genetically defined syndromes {{associated}} with increased risk for psychopathology may help in understanding neurodevelopmental mechanisms related to risk for psychopathology. Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) {{is one of the}} most common sex chromosomal aneuploidies (1 in 650 male births) and {{associated with}} increased vulnerability for psychopathology, including psychotic symptoms. Yet, it remains unknown whether this increased risk is associated with underlying psychophysiological mechanisms that are typically deficient in individuals with psychotic disorders. The present study assessed three "classic" psychophysiological markers of psychosis in Klinefelter syndrome (KS) : smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM), prepulse inhibition (PPI) and P 50 suppression. Fourteen adults with KS and 15 non-clinical adults participated in the study. Data on SPEM (reflecting visuo-motor control) as well as PPI and P 50 suppression (reflecting sensory gating) were collected. Dysfunctions in SPEM were observed in individuals with KS, with less smooth pursuit as expressed <b>in</b> <b>lower</b> <b>position</b> gain. Also, reduced sensory gating in individuals with KS was suggested by significantly reduced prepulse inhibition of the startle response (PPI) (effect size 1. 6). No abnormalities were found in suppression of the P 50 (effect size 0. 6). We speculate that impairments in these psychophysiological mechanisms may reflect core brain dysfunctions that may also mediate the described increased vulnerability for psychotic symptoms in KS. Although speculative, such deficit specific, rather than disorder specific, psychophysiological dysfunctions in KS might convey vulnerability to other types of psychopathology as well. As KS already can be diagnosed prenatally, the predictive value of childhood impairments in prepulse inhibition and smooth pursuit for development of psychopathology later in life could be assessed. In sum, studying individuals with KS may prove to be an avenue of research leading to new hypotheses and insights into "at risk" pathways to psychopathology...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which position in the occupational hierarchy is predictive of declines in perceived health status over a 48 month period in a representative sample of the Canadian labor force. We hypothesized that the proportion of workers reporting a decline in health status would be greater among persons <b>in</b> <b>lower</b> <b>position</b> in the occupational hierarchy, and that these differences in risk would primarily be explained by characteristics of the psychosocial work environment and secondarily by the baseline prevalence of adverse health behaviors. The study cohort was defined as labor force participants aged 18 - 64 who reported good, very good or excellent health in the 1994 baseline wave of Canada's National Population Health Survey and who participated in the 1998 follow-up survey. Between 1994 and 1998, 16. 6 % of labor force participants reporting excellent, very good or good health status at baseline reported a decline in perceived health status. For men, the age-adjusted odds of decline in perceived health status were 1. 80 (95 % CI: 1. 24 - 2. 63) and 1. 74 (95 % CI: 1. 19 - 2. 54) for the two lowest occupational classes relative to the highest occupational class. There was no association between position in the occupational hierarchy and the prospective risk of health status decline for women. For men, the association between position in the occupational hierarchy and decline in perceived health status was moderately reduced but remained statistically significant following adjustment for baseline health, health behaviors and psychosocial work exposures. Adjustment for household income did not alter these findings. When stratified by gender, position in the occupational hierarchy was associated with the prospective risk of health status decline for men but not for women. Among men, the collective influence of health behaviors and psychosocial work exposures explained a moderate component of the decline in perceived health status. A more robust measurement of the characteristics of labor market experiences would be expected to improve understanding of the relationship between work and health in this sample.
