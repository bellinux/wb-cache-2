40|$|In the Netherlands, the {{standard}} {{form of the}} opinion paragraph of the auditor's report refers to the financial statements giving a getrouw beeld, a phrase which in its literal meaning and material content closely resembles the British 'true and fair view'. However, in <b>Dutch</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>law,</b> the central overriding criterion is worded differently. According to the law, the financial statements are to give an 'insight' into financial position and results. The co-existence of these two phrases, which pre-dates the Fourth Directive, is an interesting departure from practice in other European countries. In this paper, we present an historical analysis of this phenomenon. We {{argue that it is}} related to a number of central concerns of the Dutch audit profession, in particular its desire to stay abreast of international developments and its attempts to define a proper balance between auditor responsibility and legal requirements. ...|$|R

The z-score is a risk-adjusted performance measure with benchmark settings predefined by <b>Dutch</b> <b>law.</b> We find that pension funds as a group cannot beat their self-selected benchmarks consistently. Applying a cross-sectional portfolio approach we find evidence that the largest pension funds outperform the smallest funds...|$|R

5000|$|The art company [...] "Inspire Art Ltd" [...] {{claimed that}} the <b>Dutch</b> <b>law</b> {{requirement}} for a minimum capital {{to operate in the}} Netherlands was an unjustified restriction on its right to freedom of establishment (now under TFEU article 49). The company was incorporated in the United Kingdom, which accords to the [...] "incorporation theory" [...] rather than the [...] "real seat theory" [...] of establishing a business in conflict of laws. It wished to carry out business in the Netherlands, running an Amsterdam art studio. <b>Dutch</b> <b>law,</b> however, applied to pseudoforeign companies to impose minimum capital requirements on businesses operating within the country. When the Dutch authorities required the company to comply with <b>Dutch</b> <b>law,</b> the question was whether that disproportionately interfered with Inspire Art Ltd's right to freedom of establishment.|$|R

40|$|Both English <b>law</b> and <b>Dutch</b> <b>law</b> contain {{general rules}} {{that result in}} the {{invalidity}} of contracts that conflict with morality or public policy. Working {{on the premise that}} each country has its own unique set of factors shaping public interests, this article highlights methodological aspects of identifying the extent to which convergences and divergences exist in the English and Dutch approaches towards the invalidity of contracts on grounds of public policy and good morals. Case patterns dealing with contracts affecting the institution of marriage under both English <b>law</b> and <b>Dutch</b> <b>law</b> are used as an example in this paper. They are analysed using a new methodology: the 'principle-policy clarification' methodology. Subsequently, the results are comparatively examined. The outcome reveals that English <b>law</b> and <b>Dutch</b> <b>law</b> converge to a significant degree as far as contracts affecting matrimony are concerned...|$|R
