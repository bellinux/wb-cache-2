500|$|Scheyer was 7th in the ACC in {{free throw}} {{percentage}} (.841) for the season, 8th in minutes per game (32.8), tied for 8th in steals per game (1.6) and three-point field goals made per game (2.1), and 18th in {{points per game}} (14.9). [...] In the team's 36 games, Scheyer led the Blue Devils in minutes, free throws, free throw percentage, 3-point field goals, 3-point field goal percentage (.395), assists, and assists per game (2.8). [...] He was named the MVP of the 2009 ACC Tournament after scoring 29 points in the championship game. Krzyzewski said after the season: [...] "He's a great competitor. [...] He handles the ball real well. He scores—he scored more when he was bringing the ball up than when he didn't bring the ball up. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> the ball is in Jon's hands, the better." [...] Reflecting his off-the-court accomplishments, Scheyer was a 2009 ACC Academic Honor Roll selection.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2002, {{appearing}} on CNN's Crossfire, Fossella argued for partly privatizing Social Security and allow {{some of the}} funds be placed on Wall Street investments. He said [...] "I happen to think the President {{is on the right}} side of history here. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> you empower American people, the more you give them the opportunity to invest on their own and being in control of their own destiny and their own retirement, the better off we'll be." [...] In a standardized constituent letter in February 2005, Fossella said [...] "We need to examine the viability of voluntary personal savings accounts in which young people would have the opportunity to invest a small portion of their savings." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Revolutionary War {{began in}} 1775, {{he joined a}} Connecticut militia and was elected first {{lieutenant}} within five months. His militia unit participated in the Siege of Boston, but Hale remained behind. It {{has been suggested that}} he was unsure as to whether he wanted to fight, or whether he was hindered because his teaching contract in New London did not expire until several months later, in July 1775. On July 4, 1775, Hale received a letter from his classmate and friend Benjamin Tallmadge, who had gone to Boston to see the siege for himself. He wrote to Hale, [...] "Was I in your condition, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> extensive service would be my choice. Our holy Religion, the honor of our God, a glorious country, & a happy constitution is what we have to defend." [...] Tallmadge's letter was so inspiring that, several days later, Hale accepted a commission as first lieutenant in the 7th Connecticut Regiment under Colonel Charles Webb of Stamford.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "good Wolf, and {{you shall}} be remembered also for your day's work; and <b>I</b> will <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> {{of you for}} having {{preserved}} {{the life of a}} creature so beautiful." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'And I hope {{we shall}} not {{separate}} so soon,' said Coningsby; 'I was much struck with what you said just now about the Reform Bill. Do {{you know that the}} more <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> I am perplexed by what is meant by Representation?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{does this}} really comfort you, mamma?" [...] said Henrietta, as {{she pressed the}} spring, and gazed thoughtfully on the portrait. [...] "O, I cannot fancy that! the more <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> I try to realize what it might have been, think what Uncle Geoffrey is to Beatrice, till sometimes, O mamma, I feel quite rebellious!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> do not <b>think</b> {{that in this}} I {{confess to}} any unusual temperament. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>more</b> closely mentally {{animated}} people scrutinize their motives the less is the importance they will attach to mere physical and brute urgencies and <b>the</b> <b>more</b> to curiosity.|$|R
60|$|They both laughed; indeed, quite a dimpled, bright-eyed, rosy, {{innocent}} pair, though <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Leonidas was <b>the</b> <b>more</b> maidenly.|$|R

6000|$|... "Perhaps you mistake their feeling, good woman; a thing <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> probable, as {{you seem}} to fancy money {{the source of their}} pride, at the very moment you deny their having any. Money is a thing on which few persons of {{cultivated}} minds pride themselves. The purse-proud are, almost invariably, the vulgar and ignorant." ...|$|E
6000|$|P.S.--The more <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> desperate {{does our}} {{position}} seem. I see no possible hope of our return. If {{there were a}} high tree {{near the edge of}} the plateau we might drop a return bridge across, but there is none within fifty yards. Our united strength could not carry a trunk which would serve our purpose. The rope, of course, is far too short that we could descend by it. No, our position is hopeless--hopeless! ...|$|E

I'm no better nor a tilted bottle, I ar'n't,--I can't stop mysen when once I begin. But you look rarely, Miss; it does me good to see you. What do you say now, Prissy?"--here Bob turned to his wife,--"Isn't it all come true as I said? Though there isn't many sorts o' goods as I can't over-praise when I set my tongue to't." ...|$|E

60|$|Answ. God {{knows best}} what we need. Paul was as righteous before {{conversion}} as any that can pretend to civility now, I suppose; {{and yet that}} notwithstanding he was made to shake, and was astonished at himself at his conversion. And truly <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> righteous any is in his own eyes before conversion, the more need he has of heart-breaking work, in order to his salvation; because a man is not by nature so easily convinced that his righteousness is to God abominable, as he is that his debauchery and profaneness is.|$|E
6000|$|She {{bowed her}} head, and replied, [...] "I {{have come to}} explain and to tell you three things. First, that all these stories are false except that about the singing. Secondly, that whoever is {{responsible}} for them has made it impossible that I should live in Monksland, so I am going to London to earn my own living there. And, thirdly, that I hope you will excuse my absence from dinner as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> I keep to myself until we go to-morrow, the better; though I reserve to myself {{the right to speak}} to Mr. Monk on this subject and to say good-bye to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 11. And {{the more}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> I bewilder myself; for these bushes, which are pruned and clipped by the deathless Gardener into these lowly {{thickets}} of bloom, do not strew {{the ground with}} fallen branches and faded clippings in any wise,--it is the pining umbrage of the patriarchal trees that tinges the ground and betrays the foot beneath them: but, under the heather and the Alpine rose.--Well, what is under them, then? I never saw, nor thought of looking,--will look presently under my own bosquets and beds of lingering heather-blossom: beds indeed they were only a month since, a foot deep in flowers, and close in tufted cushions, and the mountain air that floated over them rich in honey like a draught of metheglin.|$|E
6000|$|... "If only {{he finds}} Uncle Barnaby," [...] sighed Paul. [...] "Do you know, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> become {{convinced}} that something dreadful {{has happened to}} him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has told}} me nothing," [...] Lady Grace said--"or else told me quite other things. But <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of them <b>the</b> <b>more</b> it comes {{to me that he}} feels urged or tempted--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... ‘My dear fellow,’ replied Zero, {{with an air}} of some complacency, ‘I am well {{accustomed}} to these human weaknesses. Disgust? I have felt it myself; it speedily wears off. I think none the worse, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> of you, for this engaging frankness. And in the meanwhile, what are you to do? You find yourself, if I interpret rightly, in very much the same situation as Charles the Second (possibly the least degraded of your British sovereigns) when he was taken into the confidence of the thief. To denounce me, is out of the question; and what else can you attempt? No, dear Mr. Somerset, your hands are tied; and you find yourself condemned, under pain of behaving like a cad, to be that same charming and intellectual companion who delighted me last night.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|Two {{hours after}} noon they halted {{in a green}} nook, near a {{beautiful}} cascade that descended in a mist down a sylvan cleft, and poured its pellucid stream, for their delightful use, into a natural basin of marble. The men picketed their horses, and their corporal, who {{was a man of}} the country and their guide, distributed their rations. All vied with each other in administering to the comfort and convenience of Theodora, and Lothair hovered about her as a bee about a flower, but she was silent, which he wished to impute to fatigue. But she said she was not at all fatigued, indeed quite fresh. Before they resumed their journey he could not refrain from observing on the beauty of their resting-place. She assented with a pleasing nod, and then resuming her accustomed abstraction she said: [...] "The more <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> I am convinced that the battle is not to be fought in this country, but in France." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me we have hardly {{considered}} the matter {{enough to be able to}} say much. But I think that school would be awfully dry and dismal without--ahem!--any young ladies to make it nice. I wouldn't give a pin to go if there was only a crowd of fellows, though I like a good game as well as any man. I pity any boy who has no sisters," [...] continued Ed, warming up as he thought of his own, who loved him dearly, as well they might, for a better brother never lived. [...] "Home wouldn't be worth having without them to look after a fellow, to keep him out of scrapes, help him with his lessons, and make things jolly for his friends. I tell you we can't do without girls, and I'm not ashamed to say that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> we see of them, and try to be like them in many ways, the better men we shall be by and by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On mine honour," [...] said Peveril, [...] "you both take it {{with great}} coolness. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Countess <b>the</b> <b>more</b> {{composed}} of <b>the</b> two; for, except her movement hither, she exhibited no mark of alarm, and, moreover, seemed no way more anxious to communicate the matter to your lordship than decency rendered necessary." ...|$|R
5000|$|Palmer said, [...] "They {{apologized for}} the way they {{deviated}} from the book. Hugh Grant has turned the protagonist into a character he can live with, but {{the nature of the}} character hasn't changed. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about it, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> it seems like my book." ...|$|R
5000|$|Reas {{has said}} of his work that [...] "I would say I {{photograph}} people but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> pictures are <b>more</b> about systems people find themselves in, people shopping in supermarkets, but it’s about consumerism and how we are caught up in that. I never set anything up. Everything I photograph is as it happens".|$|R
6000|$|... "Hugh!" [...] she exclaimed, and I was silent. [...] "You don't understand," [...] {{she went}} on, a little breathlessly, [...] "what I mean by {{punishment}} is deterioration. Do you remember once, long ago, {{when you came}} to me before I was married, I said we'd both run after false gods, and that we couldn't do without them? Well, and now this has come; it seems so wonderful to me, coming again like that after we had passed it by, after we thought it had gone forever; it's opened up visions for me that I never hoped to see again. It ought to restore us, dear--that's what I'm trying to say--to redeem us, to make us capable of being what we were meant to be. If it doesn't do that, if it isn't doing so, it's the most horrible of travesties, of mockeries. If we gain life only to have it turn into death--slow death; if we go to pieces again, utterly. For now there's hope. The more <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> clearly I see that we can't take any step without responsibilities. If we take this, you'll have me, and I'll have you. And if we don't save each other--" ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{not at all}} {{pleased with}} Murray for showing the MS.; and I am certain Gifford must {{see it in the}} same light that I do. His praise is nothing to the purpose: what could he say? He could not spit in the face of one who had praised him in every {{possible}} way. I must own that I wish to have the impression removed from his mind, that I had any concern in such a paltry transaction. The more <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> it disquiets me; so I will say no more about it. It is bad enough to be a scribbler, without having recourse to such shifts to extort praise, or deprecate censure. It is anticipating, it is begging, kneeling, adulating,--the devil! the devil! the devil! and all without my wish, and contrary to my express desire. I wish Murray had been tied to Payne's neck when he jumped into the Paddington Canal, [3] and so tell him,--that is the proper receptacle for publishers. You have thought of settling in the country, why not try Notts.? I think there are places which would suit you in all points, and then you are nearer the metropolis. But of this anon.|$|E
60|$|The {{budget of}} last year I cannot admit {{to have been an}} error. People say it should have been smaller. My belief is that {{if it had been a}} smaller boat it would not have lived in such a sea. I speak of the period of the session before the China war became certain. When it did so, we were in a great strait about the paper duty. We felt the {{obligation}} incurred by the vote on the second reading, and we construed it according to the established usage. We took the more arduous, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> honourable course for a government to pursue. Had we abandoned the bill, I know not how we could have looked in the face those who had acted and invested on the faith of an unbroken practice. I admit that political motives greatly concurred to recommend the budget {{of last year}}. It was a budget of peace, and peace wanted it. The budget of this year followed from the budget of last, given the other circumstances. At the same time I can understand how the claim of tea could be set up, but not well after the occurrences of last year how it could be supported.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{like the}} English {{tailor-made}} dresses well enough for walking, Mr. Stephens," [...] said Miss Sadie from behind them. [...] "But {{for an afternoon}} dress, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> French have <b>more</b> style than <b>the</b> English. Your milliners have a more severe cut, and they don't do the cunning little ribbons and bows and things in the same way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And thought I was lost," [...] {{continued}} {{the man of}} science too much bent on his own ideas, to understand her interruption. [...] "Little danger of that! I made my own base, knew {{the length of the}} perpendicular by calculation, and to draw the hypothenuse had nothing to do but to work my angle. I supposed the guns were fired for my benefit, and changed my course for <b>the</b> sounds--not that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> sense <b>more</b> accurate, or even as accurate as a mathematical calculation, but I feared that some of the children might need my services." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You forget," [...] said Olive, [...] "that I {{told you}} I {{have not made}} up my mind yet. But {{although}} I have not come to a decision, I have a leaning toward one of them. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> incline in the direction of my old love." ...|$|R
