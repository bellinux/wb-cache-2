In {{the present}} study, an {{amphiphilic}} chitosan-polylactide (CS-PLA) graft copolymer was synthesized through grafting polylactide (PLA) onto water-soluble chitosan (CS), and the chemical structure of this newly developed copolymer {{was confirmed by}} FT-IR, 1 H NMR and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Stable flusilazole-loaded nanoparticles (NS), with a size near 280. 3 nm and a loading content (LC) of 29. 0 %, were prepared for the fungicide delivery using a nanoprecipitation method. Moreover, size, size distribution and the <b>flusilazole</b> LC {{as well as the}} in vitro release profile of flusilazole-loaded NS were investigated. In conclusion, the NS could provide a controlled release of <b>flusilazole</b> and enhance the penetration of <b>flusilazole</b> in the plant compared with classical <b>flusilazole</b> emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulation due to their small particle size.

In our study, we hypothesized that comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of rat embryos exposed to six azoles (<b>flusilazole,</b> triadimefon, ketoconazole, miconazole, difenoconazole and prothioconazole) {{could lead to a}} better mechanism-based understanding of their embryotoxicity and pharmacological action. For evaluating embryotoxicity, we applied the total morphological scoring system (TMS) in embryos exposed for 48 h. The compounds tested showed embryotoxicity in a dose-response fashion. Functional analysis of differential {{gene expression}} after 4 h exposure at the ID 10 (effective dose for 10 % decreased TMS), revealed the sterol biosynthesis pathway and embryonic development genes, dominated by genes in the retinoic acid (RA) pathway, albeit in a differential way. <b>Flusilazole,</b> ketoconazole and triadimefon were the most potent compounds affecting the RA pathway, while in terms of regulation of sterol function, difenoconazole and ketoconazole showed the most pronounced effects. Dose-dependent analysis of the effects of <b>flusilazole</b> revealed that the RA pathway related genes were already differentially expressed at low dose levels while the sterol pathway showed strong regulation at higher embryotoxic doses, suggesting that this pathway is less predictive for the observed embryotoxicity. A similar analysis at the 24 -hour time point indicated an additional time-dependent difference in the aforementioned pathways regulated by <b>flusilazole.</b> In summary, the rat WEC assay in combination with transcriptomics could add a mechanistic insight into the embryotoxic potency ranking and pharmacological mode of action of the tested compounds...|$|E

40|$|Amphibians are {{regarded}} as sensitive sentinels of environmental pollution due to their permeable skin and complex life cycle, which usually involves reproduction and development in the aquatic environment. Fungicides are widely applied agrochemicals and {{have been associated with}} developmental defects in amphibians; thus, it is important to determine chronic effects of environmentally-relevant concentrations of such contaminants in target cells. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy has been employed to signature the biological effects of environmental contaminants through extracting key features in IR spectra with chemometric methods. Herein, the Xenopus laevis (A 6) cell line was exposed to low concentrations of carbendazim (a benzimidazole fungicide) or <b>flusilazole</b> (a triazole fungicide) either singly or as a binary mixture. Cells were then examined using attenuated total reflection Fouriertransform IR (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy coupled with multivariate analysis. Results indicate significant changes in the IR spectra of cells induced by both agents at all concentrations following single exposures, primarily in regions associated with protein and phospholipids. Distinct differences were apparent in the IR spectra of cells exposed to carbendazim and those exposed to <b>flusilazole,</b> suggesting different mechanisms of action. Exposure to binary mixtures of carbendazim and <b>flusilazole</b> also induced significant spectral alterations, again in regions associated with phospholipids and proteins, but also in regions associated with DNA and carbohydrates.

40|$|Developmental {{toxicity}} can {{be caused}} through a multitude of mechanisms and can therefore not be captured through a single simple mechanistic paradigm. However, {{it may be possible}} to define a selected group of overarching mechanisms that might allow detection of the vast majority of developmental toxicants. Against this background, we have explored the usefulness of retinoic acid mediated regulation of neural tube and axial patterning as a general mechanism that, when perturbed, may result in manifestations of developmental toxicity that may cover a large part of malformations known to occur in experimental animals and in man. Through a literature survey, we have identified key genes in the regulation of retinoic acid homeostasis, as well as marker genes of neural tube and axial patterning, that may be used to detect developmental toxicants in in vitro systems. A retinoic acid-neural tube/axial patterning adverse outcome pathway (RA-NTA AOP) framework was designed. The framework was tested against existing data of <b>flusilazole</b> exposure in the rat whole embryo culture, the zebrafish embryotoxicity test, and the embryonic stem cell test. <b>Flusilazole</b> is known to interact with retinoic acid homeostasis, and induced common and unique NTA marker gene changes in the three test systems. Flusilazole-induced changes were similar in directionality to gene expression responses after retinoic acid exposure. It is suggested that the RA-NTA framework may provide a general tool to define mechanistic pathways and biomarkers of developmental toxicity that may be used in alternative in vitro assays for the detection of embryotoxic compounds.

We then compare this to concentrations of these pesticides found in pollen collected by honey bees and in pollen and adult bees sampled from bumble bee colonies placed on arable farms. We also compared this with levels found in bumble bee colonies placed in urban areas. Pollen of oilseed rape was heavily contaminated with {{a broad range of}} pesticides, as was the pollen of wildflowers growing nearby.

The first major release of L. maculans ascospores was earlier in 2000 (26 September) and 2001 (18 September) than in 2002 (21 October). Consequently, the autumn phoma leaf spot epidemic was also earlier in 2000 and 2001 than in 2002. The resulting stem canker epidemics were severe by harvest (July) in 2001 and 2002 but not in 2003.

Potential chemical risks of eight fungicides (for wheat treatments) for A. bisporus: mancozeb, carbendazim, thiophanate-methyl,carbendazim+cyproconazole, carbedazim+flusilasole, captan, chlorothalonil and trifloxystrobinare disscused. Only the value of maximum residue level of flusilasole and its formulation was evaluated as higher than medium effective concentration of the fungicide for A. bisporus. As a conclusion, <b>flusilazole</b> treatment could be a limiting factor for using straw for composting and mushroom cultivation...|$|E
40|$|Secondary {{exposure}} to pesticide residues on the external surfaces of sprayers does not currently {{form part of}} the risk assessment process. A measure of {{the ease with which}} residues may be transferred from the sprayer surface to the operator would enhance the accuracy of any such assessment. This study quantified the dislodgeability of six pesticides from sprayer surfaces in order to calculate the transfer efficiencies. The transfer efficiency was compound dependent, ranging from 80 % for azoxystrobin to < 25 % for <b>flusilazole</b> and tebuconazole. When the washed and unwashed surfaces were analysed separately, more pendimethalin and isoproturon residues were removed from the wet surface compared with the dry surface. The variation in results for the different compounds highlights the need to consider a range of compounds to form generic statements to support guidelines regarding operator {{exposure to}} pesticide residues on sprayers...|$|E
40|$|Protection of wounds against {{infection}} by trunk disease pathogens is {{the most}} efficient and cost-effective means to prevent grapevine trunk diseases. Studies done to determine the effectiveness of chemical pruning wound protectants have mostly focused on the control of Eutypa lata. However, other important wound pathogens, such as Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, Phaeoacremonium spp., Phomopsis spp. and species of Botryosphaeriaceae (including Botryosphaeria and aggregate genera), pose just as significant a threat to sustainable grape production. Fungicide sensitivity {{studies have been conducted}} for Pa. chlamydospora, P. viticola and E. lata. However, no such studies have been conducted for the pathogenic species of Botryosphaeriaceae from grapevines in South Africa. Ten fungicides were, therefore, tested in vitro for their efficacy on mycelial inhibition of the four most common or pathogenic species of Botryosphaeriaceae in South Africa, 'B. ' obtusa, Neofusicoccum australe, N. parvum and Lasiodiplodia theobromae. Iprodione, pyrimethanil, copper ammonium acetate, kresoxim-methyl and boscalid were ineffective in inhibiting the mycelial growth at the highest concentrations tested (20 mu g/mL for copper ammonium acetate, 5 mu g/mL for other agents tested). Benomyl, tebuconazole, prochloraz manganese chloride and <b>flusilazole</b> were the most effective fungicides with EC 50 values for the different species ranging from 0. 36 - 0. 55, 0. 07 - 0. 17, 0. 07 - 1. 15 and 0. 04 - 0. 36 mu g/mL, respectively. These fungicides, except prochloraz manganese chloride, are registered for use on grapes in South Africa and were also reported to be effective against Pa. chlamydospora, P. viticola and E. lata. Results from bioassays on 1 -year-old Chenin Blanc grapevine shoots indicated that benomyl, tebuconazole and prochloraz manganese chloride were most effective in limiting lesion length in pruning wounds that were inoculated with species of Botryosphaeriaceae after fungicide treatment. The bioassay findings were, however, inconclusive due to low and varied re-isolation incidences. Benomyl, tebuconazole, prochloraz manganese chloride and <b>flusilazole</b> can be identified as fungicides to be evaluated as pruning wound protectants in additional bioassays and vineyard trials against species of Botryosphaeriaceae {{as well as the other}} grapevine trunk disease pathogens...|$|E
40|$|From {{winter wheat}} and winter {{triticale}} stems with distinct disease lesions 123 isolates of eyespot agent - Tapesia yallundae fungus were obtained. Stems {{were collected in}} 1999 - 2001, from no-treatment and protected with fungicides fields, which were situated in three provinces of Poland (małopolskie, mazowieckie, śląskie). Obtained isolates were classified {{on the basis of}} morphology on PDA, sporulation on water agar and sensitivity to carbendazim and prochloraz 51 isolates (i. e. 41, 5 % of all) represent R- growth type of fungus. To this type belong 28 % and 71 % strains obtained from wheat and triticale stems, respectively. Only seven isolates ofR-type fungus (i. e. 13, 7 %) were resistant to carbendazim. These strains originated from two protected with carbendazim winter wheat fields and two no-protected winter triticale crops. All isolates of R-type were sensitive to prochloraz. This compounds appears in vitro more effective than <b>flusilazole,</b> propiconazole and azoxystrobin...|$|E
40|$|In 1999 - 2001, {{studies were}} carried out in spring barley with the aim to {{evaluate}} the efficacy as well as practical and economic effectiveness of fungicide application to control fungal diseases. The following fungicides were used: prochloraz 30 % + carbendazim 8 %; <b>flusilazole</b> 12, 5 % + carbendazim 25 %; azoxystrobin 25 %; kresoxim-methyl 12, 5 % + epoxyconazole 12, 5 %; tridemorf 37, 5 % + epoxyconazole 12, 5 %; fluquinconazole 10 %; metconazole 6 %. The infection of barley leaf surface with fungal diseases ranged from 41, 3 % to 60, 1 %. The tested chemicals showed high effectiveness amounting to 31, 6 % - 92, 3 %, On average, to 73, 9 %. All applied fungicides contributed to the seed yield increase from 0, 32 t/ha to 1, 28 t/ha, on average, to 0, 8 t/ha. The defrayal index ranged from 0, 9 to 2, 4, while the index of chemical treatment profitability - from 2, 7 to 9, 2...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a general}} perception, amongst farmers and researchers, that post-application {{residues}} on the external surfaces of sprayers are negligible compared with residues remaining on the internal surfaces, {{although there have been}} few attempts to verify this assumption. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate, using cotton glove sampling, operator exposure resulting from three typical operations: entering and working in the cab, general handling of the sprayer and maintenance practices. Samples were analysed for azoxystrobin, carbendazim, chlorothalonil, cyanazine, cypermethrin, epoxiconazole, <b>flusilazole,</b> isoproturon, kresoxim-methyl, metaza-chlor, pendimethalin, pirimicarb and tebuconazole. Isoproturon, pendimethalin, chlorothalonil and carbendazim were detected> 1 mg per glove pair on the cotton gloves, but on the whole there was variability in residue levels between and within compounds. Comparison of results with occupational exposure limits indicated that residues were such that they may not neces-sarily be considered insignificant. It may therefore be prudent to develop more efficient meth-ods for the external decontamination of sprayers and/or raise awareness of the findings...|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} Gompertz {{model was}} derived {{to describe the}} fractional decline in green area of wheat flag leaves in field experiments where green leaf area at time t= 100 exp[-exp(-k(t-m)) ]. Curves fitted over time to visual assessments of green leaf area (% of total leaf area) throughout flag leaf life {{accounted for more than}} 98 % of variation in 45 of 48 wheat cultivar ? fungicide treatment (+/?) comparisons. This data set spanned 17 yr and therefore included cultivars of contrasting parentage and age. In the absence of fungicide, green leaf area decline was associated with drought or infection with a number of foliar pathogens including Septoria tritici (sexual stage Mycospherella graminicola), Erysiphe graminis and Puccinia striiformis. Fungicides applied to the flag leaf included propiconazole, propiconazole plus tridemorph, <b>flusilazole</b> or azoxystrobin. Fungicide effects on m (i. e. time to 37 % green area) were closely related to fungicide effects (% of untreated) on mean grain weight (variation accounted for (VAF) = 80 %) and grain yield (VAF = 85 %) ...|$|E

In addition, 1 and 2 displayed comparable potencies in respect of sterol biosynthesis inhibition in Sacclulromycopsis üpolytica and Pyricularia oryzae, the mode of action being primarily an inhtbition of oxidative C 14 -demethylation...|$|E
40|$|Commonly used as {{antifungal}} {{agents in}} agriculture and medicine, triazoles {{have been shown}} to cause teratogenicity in a diverse set of animal models. Here, we evaluated the dose-dependent impacts of <b>flusilazole,</b> cyproconazole and triadimefon, on global gene expression in relation to effects on embryonic development using the rat whole embryo culture (WEC) model. After 4 h exposure, we identified changes in gene expression due to triazole exposure which preceded morphological alterations observed at 48 h. In general, across the three triazoles, we observed similar directionality of regulation in gene expression and the magnitude of effects on gene expression correlated with the degree of induced developmental toxicity. Significantly regulated genes included key members of steroid/cholesterol and retinoic acid metabolism and hindbrain developmental pathways. Direct comparisons with previous studies suggest that triazole-gene signatures identified in the WEC overlap with zebrafish and mouse, and furthermore, triazoles impact gene expression in a similar manner as retinoic acid exposures in rat embryos. In summary, we further differentiate pathways underlying triazole-developmental toxicity using WEC and demonstrate the conservation of these response-pathways across model systems...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{zebrafish}} embryotoxicity test (ZET) is a {{fast and}} simple method to study chemical toxicity after {{exposure of the}} complete vertebrate embryo during embryogenesis in ovo. We developed a novel quantitative evaluation method to assess {{the development of the}} zebrafish embryo based on specific endpoints in time, the general morphology score (GMS) system. For teratogenic effects a separate scoring list was developed. The relative effects of eight glycol ethers and six 1, 2, 4 -triazole anti-fungals were evaluated in this system and results were compared with in vivo developmental toxicity potencies. Methoxyacetic acid and ethoxyacetic acid appeared as the most potent glycol ether metabolites, inducing growth retardation and malformations. Other glycol ethers showed no developmental toxicity. <b>Flusilazole</b> appeared the most potent triazole, followed by hexaconazole, cyproconazole, triadimefon, myclobutanil and triticonazole, respectively. In general, the potency ranking of the compounds within their class in the ZET was comparable to their in vivo ranking. In conclusion, the ZET with the GMS system appears an efficient and useful test system for screening embryotoxic properties of chemicals within the classes of compounds tested. This alternative test method may also be useful for the detection of embryotoxic properties of other classes of chemicals...|$|E
