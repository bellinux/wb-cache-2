5|$|Since it is {{impossible}} to entirely eliminate pest insects from the <b>human</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain,</b> insects are inadvertently present in many foods, especially grains. Food safety laws in many countries do not prohibit insect parts in food, but rather limit their quantity. According to cultural materialist anthropologist Marvin Harris, the eating of insects is taboo in cultures that have other protein sources such as fish or livestock.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease may}} be most {{frequently}} transmitted to humans by eating food contaminated with the brain, spinal cord, or digestive tract of infected carcasses. However, the infectious agent, although most highly concentrated in nervous tissue, {{can be found in}} virtually all tissues throughout the body, including blood. When it has been transmitted to humans, it is known as new Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD or nvCJD), and by June 2014 it had killed 177 people in the United Kingdom, and 52 elsewhere, primarily in western Europe. Between 460,000 and 482,000 BSE-infected animals had entered the <b>human</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain</b> before controls on high-risk offal were introduced in 1989.|$|E
25|$|For {{many of the}} vCJD patients, direct {{evidence}} exists that they had consumed tainted beef, and this {{is assumed to be}} the mechanism by which all affected individuals contracted it. Disease incidence also appears to correlate with slaughtering practices that led to the mixture of nervous system tissue with ground meat (mince) and other beef. An estimated 400,000 cattle infected with BSE entered the <b>human</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain</b> in the 1980s. Although the BSE epizootic was eventually brought under control by culling all suspect cattle populations, people are still being diagnosed with vCJD each year (though the number of new cases currently has dropped to fewer than five per year). This is attributed to the long incubation period for prion diseases, which is typically measured in years or decades. As a result, {{the full extent of the}} human vCJD outbreak is still not known.|$|E

2500|$|Cycads are {{gymnosperms}} (naked seeded), meaning their unfertilized {{seeds are}} open to the air to be directly fertilized by pollination, as contrasted with angiosperms, which have enclosed seeds with more complex fertilization arrangements. Cycads have very specialized pollinators, usually a specific species of beetle. They have been reported to fix nitrogen in association with various cyanobacteria living in the roots (the [...] "coralloid" [...] roots). These photosynthetic bacteria produce a neurotoxin called BMAA that is found in the seeds of cycads. This neurotoxin may enter a [...] <b>human</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain</b> as the cycad seeds may be eaten directly as a source of flour by humans or by wild or feral animals such as bats, and humans may eat these animals.

40|$|The main {{conclusions}} {{of this report}} are that antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are transmitted to <b>humans</b> through the <b>food</b> <b>chain,</b> although the contribution of this transmission pathway to the overall problem of AMR in humans is not readily quantified. Measures aimed at reducing or eliminating bacteria from food, e. g. cooking, good hygiene practice, {{can be expected to}} substantially reduce the risk of transmission of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria through the <b>food</b> <b>chain.</b> Antimicrobial resistance is driven by antimicrobial consumption; there is intense use of antimicrobials in at least some sectors of primary food production in Ireland, and there is scope to reduce use. This is required as part of an all-sector response to reduce and improve antimicrobial use, and the National Interdepartmental Antimicrobial Resistance Consultative Committee is a key structure to manage this process. There are gaps in current systems for surveillance of antimicrobial use in food production and of AMR in the <b>food</b> <b>chain,</b> and integration and analysis of human and non-human antimicrobial resistance data are lacking. A key recommendation includes reducing the demand for antimicrobial use in primary production by improving preventive measures. When required, prudent use of antimicrobial agents should be supported by improving training and therapeutic guidelines, equivalent regulatory control of all antimicrobial formulations, developing targets and incentives for each animal sector to drive more prudent use and by developing systems that allow more targeted delivery of antimicrobial agents to the animals that actually need to receive them. Systems to improve surveillance of antimicrobial use and of AMR should be further developed and findings published annually as an integrated <b>human</b> and <b>food</b> <b>chain</b> report...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. This study {{assessed}} the sustainable food procurement {{of members of}} the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA). It also considered the inconsistencies between their animal and <b>human</b> <b>food</b> supply <b>chains,</b> as well as between between their procurement priorities and practices. Design. A quantitative, cross-sectional approach was employed, involving the use of a web-based questionnaire to gather data from 41 BIAZA members across 21 indicators of food sustainability. The results were considered within a Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) framework. Findings. There was considerable variation amongst the issues considered by zoos during the SFP process for their animal and <b>human</b> <b>food</b> operations. For both, local expenditure, nutritional content and packaging reduction were some of the highest scoring indicators in practice and as priorities. The overall levels of SFP were found to be equal between the <b>human</b> and animal <b>food</b> supply <b>chains.</b> Significantly low levels of inconsistency were found between the two, practically and in terms of procurement aspirations.

Soil and plant samples were collected from the Group 61 area at the Joliet Army Ammunition Plant and analyzed {{to determine the extent}} to which 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) and its degradation products are taken up by existing vegetation and crops growing on contaminated soils. Neither TNT nor its degradation products was detected in any of the aboveground plant organs of existing vegetation. Oat (Avena sativa L.) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) were planted on TNT-contaminated soils amended with three levels of chopped grass hay. Extractable TNT concentrations in hay-amended soils were monitored for almost 1 year. Crop establishment and growth improved with increased levels of hay amendment, but TNT uptake was not affected or detected in any aboveground crop organs. Evidence was found to indicate that soil manipulation and hay addition may reduce extractable TNT concentration in soils, but the wide variations in TNT concentrations in these soils prevented development of conclusive evidence regarding reduction of extractable TNT concentrations. Results from this study suggest that vegetation grown on TNT-contaminated soils is not a major health concern because TNT and its degradation products were not detected in aboveground plant organs. However, low concentrations of TNT, 4 -amino- 2, 6 -dinitrotoluene, and 2 -amino- 4, 6 -dinitrotoluene were detected in or on some existing vegetation and crop roots. 21 refs., 10 figs., 26 tabs...|$|R
30|$|The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} environmental pollution, especially soil contamination with heavy metals {{has led to}} their uptake in the <b>human</b> <b>food</b> <b>chains</b> through plant parts. Accumulation and magnification of heavy metals in human tissues through consumption of herbal remedies can cause hazardous impacts on health. Therefore, chemical profiling of nine heavy metals (Mn, Cr, Pb, Fe, Cd, Co, Zn, Ni and Hg) was undertaken in stem and leaf samples of ten medicinal plants (Acacia nilotica, Bacopa monnieri, Commiphora wightii, Ficus religiosa, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Hemidesmus indicus, Salvadora oleoides, Terminalia bellirica, Terminalia chebula and Withania somnifera) collected from environmentally diverse regions of Haryana and Rajasthan states in North-Western India. Concentration of all heavy metals, except Cr, was within permissible limits in the tested stem and leaf samples. Leaf samples had consistently more Cr compared to respective stem samples with highest concentration in leaf samples of Bacopa monnieri (13.19 [*]±[*] 0.0480 ppm) and stem samples of Withania somnifera (4.93 [*]±[*] 0.0185 ppm) both collected from Bahadurgarh (heavy industrial area), Haryana. This amount was beyond the permissible limit of 2.0 ppm defined by WHO for raw herbal material. Other two most perilous metals Pb (2.64 [*]±[*] 0.0260) and Cd (0.04 [*]±[*] 0.0274) were also recorded in Bahadurgarh region, although below permissible limits. Concentration of Hg remained below detectable levels in all the leaf and stem samples tested. These results suggested that cultivation of medicinal plants and other dietary herbs should be curtailed near environmentally polluted especially industrial areas for avoidance of health hazards.|$|R
40|$|Strategies to {{investigate}} the possible existence of sporadic bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) require systematic testing programs to identify cases in countries considered to {{have little or no}} risk for orally acquired disease or to detect a stable occurrence of atypical cases in countries in which orally acquired disease is disappearing. To achieve 95 % statistical confidence that the prevalence of sporadic BSE is no greater than 1 per million (i. e., the annual incidence of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [CJD] in humans) would require negative tests in 3 million randomly selected older cattle. A link between BSE and sporadic CJD has been suggested on the basis of laboratory studies but is unsupported by epidemiologic observation. Such a link might yet be established by the discovery of a specific molecular marker or of particular combinations of trends over time of typical and atypical BSE and various subtypes of sporadic CJD, as their numbers are influenced by a continuation of current public health measures that exclude high-risk bovine tissues from the animal and <b>human</b> <b>food</b> <b>chains.</b> Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was first recognized in 1986 in the United Kingdom and quickly reached epidemic proportions, affecting> 30, 000 cattle per year by 1992.
