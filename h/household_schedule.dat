40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the development of}} sport in county Westmeath between 1850 and 1905. The subject is an unexplored one in the Irish context but by extensive use of contemporary newspapers and the census enumerators' <b>household</b> <b>schedule</b> forms of 1901, an attempt is made to re-create the sporting and recreational world of Victorian and early Edwardian Westmeath. The thesis is organised thematically in that selected sports are examined individually on a chronological basis within each chapter. The development of a club institution, the fmancing of the activity {{and the development of}} a competitive structure within the sporting discipline are key issues explored. The study is inclusive in that a wide range of sports is examined, as well as the recreational habits and social networks of the different socio-occupational classes. The role of sport in the lives of women and the importance of the military in recreational development are also explored. Quantification, and classification is an essential feature of this study. The number of events organised are measured, a sample of individual participants in the different sports are identified and are classified into one of four different social classes. As a result of this methodology a key fmding that emerges from the study is the extent to which sporting involvement was a product of the class structure of Westmeath society. The importance of sports participation to the socialisation process is also explored and the manner in which sport became a conduit for socialisation is documented. In its entirety, the thesis makes a major contribution to the history of sport and social interaction in Ireland, and demonstrates how in the context of Westmeath, sport developed as a major focus for people's live...|$|E

Study Design: Random sampling technique has been used to collect household data. It has been purpossively selected 28 villages. The criteria selecting this villges are that they are close to the uranium mining site. Around 719 households from these 28 villages were covered for the present study. Data collected from households have been analysed for each village separately. Data are calculated in excel and for frequencies are used in SPSS software. Separate layers of data have been mapped for each of the demographic parameters for which the household information has been collected through a structured <b>household</b> <b>schedule</b> canvassed through an interview method. Mapping technique has been employed on a GIS platform to get a comprehensive demographic picture of each of the sample villages in each of the distance zone. Place and Duration of Study: West Khasi Hills District, Meghalaya, N. E. India between 2009 and 2011. Methodology: Data for the present researchhas been collected from a number of villages located around Domiasiat village which is the locus of the proposed uranium mining. The health conditions and the disease prevalence in the area around this village have been assessed by collecting useful information from households in 28 villages {{selected on the basis of}} distance criterion. Results: A study of the morbidity pattern reveals the dominance of communicable diseases as reported by the respondents. The types of sicknesses recorded during the survey shows that the most prevalent type of sickness is malaria that afflicted more than 45. 27 percent adult males, 41. 20 percent adult females, and 33. 18 percent children of the population interviewed. Diarrhea/dysentery affected 32. 03 percent of the children, 29. 62 percent of the adult males and 28. 93 percent of the adult females.

40|$|Natural {{resources}} {{are an integral}} part of all human civilization. Again, natural resources that can either be renewable or non-renewable, affords adequate atmosphere towards economic development. Coal as a form of non-renewable natural resource is obtainable through excavation. But in the process, it is often regarded as a socially and environmentally stubborn substance. In India, the process of globalization has encouraged the industrial giants to mine the natural resources which have witnessed a virtuous symbol of economic activity since then. By introducing this resource-extraction industry, the unindustrialised realms are earning substantial section of foreign exchange and at the same time subsidising obviously to the growth of gross domestic product. At the onset, the new mining projects necessitated massive acres of land to execute their operation and started convincing the mass by providing a better income earning environment as well as the infrastructural developments like well-connected roads, electricity, health care facilities etc. But the fruit of development cannot be fortified by overlooking the source and means of living of the project affected communities. Moreover, the by-products of coal mining such as loss of agro-based livelihood, decrease of natural capital, pollution and ill health are becoming the matter of concern globally. In this background the present study was undertaken by taking three specific objectives: first, to analyse the impact of coal mining on the local communities and their livelihood with special reference to Ib Valley coalfield; second, to explore the impact of coal mining on the rural social structure; and finally, to assess the adverse effects of coal mining on the health condition of rural people. To attain these objectives, the present research was carried out in the Ib Valley Coalfield, a subsidiary of Mahanadi Coalfields Limited. Much before the instigation of field work a pilot study was conducted and on the basis of that pilot study, six mining affected villages and two control villages were selected in the same district and within the same agro-climatic zone. While mining affected villages were selected within the vicinity of three kilometres from mining, control villages were selected around twenty kilometres distance from the active mining region. Using the systematic random sampling method, a sample of 50 households from each village was undertaken. Thus a total of 400 such households (300 from mining affected villages and 100 from control villages) were taken as sample for the study. Data were collected by employing both qualitative and quantitative techniques. Primary data were collected using <b>household</b> <b>schedule,</b> case study, observation methods and some unstructured questionnaires. Discussions were organized with public and other stakeholders. In depth interview was also held with officials from the Mahanadi Coalfields Limited, State Government, NGO personnel, and local leaders. For secondary information, government records, newspaper articles and other available literatures were reviewed. Then the data were analysed by using SPSS software. The findings of the research conclude that mining has given rise to positive implications on financial capital and can be held responsible for mixed impacts on human and physical capital. In one aspect, it is providing a wider atmosphere for diversified sources of livelihood generation; on the other aspect it has alienated the project affected rural communities from their traditional agro-based livelihoods. Subsequently, with the introduction of mining projects, the network ties among the mining affected mass is getting disturbed and the traditional base of structural aspect has lost its significance. Results also indicate that along with improved infrastructure, it has ironically created conducive condition for pollution of air, water and noise that in turn are responsible for varied health issues. Though the provision of medical assistance is available, it is only restricted to the workforce of MCL and others are not fortunate enough to avail any benefit...|$|E

40|$|The lack of multi-day {{data for}} {{household}} travel and vehicle capability requirements is {{an impediment to}} evaluations of energy savings strategies, since 1) travel requirements vary from day-to-day, and 2) energy-saving transportation options often have reduced capability. This work demonstrates a survey methodology and modeling system for evaluating the energy-savings potential of household travel, considering multi-day travel requirements and capability constraints imposed by the available transportation resources. A stochastic scheduling model is introduced – the multi-day <b>Household</b> Activity <b>Schedule</b> Estimator (mPHASE) – which generates synthetic daily schedules based on “fuzzy” descriptions of activity characteristics using a finite-element representation of activity flexibility, coordination among <b>household</b> members, and <b>scheduling</b> conflict resolution. Results of a thirty-household pilot study are presented in which responses to an interactive computer assisted personal interview were used as inputs to the mPHASE model in order to illustrate the feasibility of generating complex, realistic multi-day <b>household</b> <b>schedules.</b> Study vehicles were equipped with digital cameras and GPS data acquisition equipment to validate the model results. The synthetically generated schedules captured an average of 60 percent of household travel distance, and exhibited many {{of the characteristics of}} complex household travel, including day-to-day travel variation, and <b>schedule</b> coordination among <b>household</b> members. Future advances in the methodology may improve the model results, such as encouraging more detailed and accurate responses by providing a selection of generated schedules during the interview. Finally, the Constraints-based Transportation Resource Assignment Model (CTRAM) is introduced. Using an enumerative optimization approach, CTRAM determines the energy-minimizing vehicle-to-trip assignment decisions, considering trip schedules, occupancy, and vehicle capability. Designed to accept either actual or synthetic schedules, results of an application of the optimization model to the 2001 and 2009 National Household Travel Survey data show that U. S. households can reduce energy use by 10 percent, on average, by modifying the assignment of existing vehicles to trips. Households in 2009 show a higher tendency to assign vehicles optimally than in 2001, and multi-vehicle households with diverse fleets have greater savings potential, indicating that fleet modification strategies may be effective, particularly under higher energy price conditions...|$|R

Despite this, very little fundamental research has been conducted into the underlying scheduling process to improve our understanding and ability forecast travel. The experimental survey approach presented in this paper attempts to fill this gap. At the core of the survey is a Computerized <b>Household</b> Activity <b>Scheduling</b> (CHASE) software program. The program is unique in that it runs for a week long period during which time all adult household members login daily to record their scheduling decisions as they occur over time. An up-front interview is used to define a household's activity agenda and mode availability. A sample of 41 households (66 adults and 14 children) was used to assess the performance of the survey. Analysis focuses on times to completion, daily scheduling steps, activity-travel patterns, and scheduling time horizons. Overall, the results show that the computer-based survey design was successful in gathering an array of information on the underlying process, while minimizing the burden on respondents. The survey was also capable of tracing traditionally observed activity-travel outcomes over a multi-day period with minimal fatigue effects. The paper concludes with a detailed discussion on future survey design, including issues of instrument bias, use of the Internet, and improved tracing of spatial behaviour.

The {{main purpose of}} this design is to offset the weakness inherent within one method with {{the strengths of the}} other method (Creswell et al. 2006; Teddlie and Tashakkori 2003). The study adopted a survey method conducted during the ‘reverse migration’ cycle from summer higher grazing pastures (dhoks), and included 250 structured <b>household</b> <b>schedules.</b> These schedules incorporated both sedentarized and migratory populations with a sample size of 150 and 100 households, respectively. Mountain passes are the traditional migration routes with a fixed schedule of departures. Three transhumance routes, i.e. Pir Ki Gali Pass, Jamiyan Gali Pass and Nurpur Pass, were selected to obtain qualitative information pertaining to barriers for access to higher pastures. Maximum information was collected through 100 semi-structured schedules. A snowball sampling technique of identifying households was used for quantitative information, and samples for qualitative inquiry based on willingness to participate were selected. Further, to corroborate the quantitative findings, 10 focused group discussions were conducted with the help of Jirgas (Tribal Panchayats). Discussions and interviews were conducted in the Gojri local dialect, and saturation and redundancy of information were used to frame the discussion. Also, a facility survey encompassing 12 primary health centres, three community health centres and two district hospitals was conducted, coupled with administrative data from government offices to unravel the impact of supply-side factors on access and utilization. The norms considered for minimum service coverage, human resource, equipment and infrastructure were taken to be symptomatic of the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) and were used to derive the dimension score and overall health facility readiness score.|$|R

An integrated land use - transport model is being developed to estimate the change in residential location choice and travel behaviour in the cities of Kitchener and Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Within this model, there must be a representation of the daily travel decisions made by households to determine when and how people travel to activities. This decision is constrained by the availability of travel resources, such as vehicles or chaperones (for households with members that cannot travel on their own) This research proposes a model for these daily travel decisions that allocates travel resources to household members so that they are able to achieve their desired activities in a day. The output of the model is a set of scheduled tours and activities for each member of the household. The model is informed by a survey of 14 households within the Region of Waterloo, and tested against 9 <b>household</b> <b>schedules</b> that are located within the cities of Kitchener and Waterloo. The result of the model tests show that it performs relatively well in the scheduling of activities and the creation of tours if there is some level of time constraint associated with the discretionary activities. As well, the model is able to predict the mode choice for most tours, but some mode preferences are not entirely captured. Furthermore, this model is able to complete the travel resource allocation in an average time of 36 milliseconds per household. This research serves as the foundation for a model of household transport decisions that may be incorporated into the broader integrated land use - transport model for Kitchener and Waterloo...|$|R

Within the RTE Act, special attention is given to Section 12 (1) (c), the free private school seats provision. The argument is {{that in order to}} fully analyze education progress, research must advance beyond focusing on physical access to exploring indicators of meaningful access. This thesis discusses the construction of a quantitative variable, ‘silent exclusion’, as a composite drawn from wider qualitative research. The first available data from the Insights into Education household survey in Delhi are analyzed using statistical and econometric techniques. It was found that private unaided recognized schools remain inaccessible for the most marginalized households. Child’s sex was not found to {{have a significant effect on}} school management choice, and both boys and girls attended privately and publically managed elementary schools in the sample. Four access issues pertaining to the free seat provision were identified: public awareness; reaching intended beneficiaries; low success rates for applicants; and continuing financial challenges for households accessing a free seat. In terms of children’s schooling experiences, low levels of silent exclusion were reported overall. Explicit displays of discrimination and exclusion were not found in the sample; however, less visible displays of exclusion were noted, such as a lack of leadership opportunities for children from lower income <b>households,</b> <b>scheduled</b> castes/tribes, and children attending government-managed schools. A lack of political and social pressure to fully implement the RTE Act at the local level is evident, which raises the question of how much a law in itself can bring about social change in the education sector...|$|R

Using mixed-methods, the research looks at the travel activities and employment geographies of different socio-economics across the Tyne & Wear metropolitan area. It considers the actual and perceived mobilities of households in a specific area (West Gateshead, encompassing the wider MetroCentre area and some of Britain's most deprived communities), and the relationships between mobility, access to employment, education/training, and other basic services. The employment destination patterns of different socio-economic groups across a large urban area were analysed using kernel probability analysis of the Tyne & Wear Household Travel Survey, in combination with key socioeconomic data-sets. This analysis shows that different communities have markedly different employment geographies. This is related to availability of suitable work that can be accessed within the often-narrow time-geographies imposed by inadequate transport systems and the complexities of <b>household</b> <b>scheduling.</b> Using focus groups, whose participants were drawn from deprived neighbourhoods •of Tyne & Wear, and included both those in work, jobseekers, and full-time carers, the issues of barriers to mobility and the resilience of household travel mobility in the face of changing circumstance were explored. Using time-geographic analysis of household trips and service provision, combined with activity-travel diaries and qualitative interviews, this study highlights (a) household strategies within a time-geographic framework, for obtaining a sufficient level of mobility to access employment and services across an urban area, and (b) how households maintain resilience and respond in the face of major changes, such as having children, and economic crises, such as the loss of a job or a loss of resources required for travel.

40|$|Abstract. An {{operational}} {{model of}} <b>household</b> activity <b>scheduling</b> is proposed. The model {{is based on}} a theory entailing behavioral principles of how persons acquire, represent, and use information from and about the environment. Choices of destinations and departure times are consequences of the scheduling of a set of activities to be executed in a given time cycle. Illustrative computer simulations of the operational model show realistic effects of work hours, living in or outside the center, and travel speed. Several necessary improvements of the theory and operational model are discussed, such as incorporating learning effects and choice of travel mode for home-based trip chains. Strategies outlined for empirical tests include comparisons with existing models, psychological experiments illuminating basic assumptions, and the use of geographical information systems to process traveldiary data for single cases...|$|R

The outcomes suggest that egalitarian role expectations and higher female work status {{lead to a more}} balanced allocation of work and households tasks between spouses. More traditional role views and increased time pressure lead to more specialisation and inequality between spouses. Interestingly, households under time pressure apply day-to-day specialisation to arrive at balanced weekly allocation totals. ...|$|R

30|$|The closest {{neighborhood}} to Jardim Canaã is DR, home to 450 families. DR's <b>households</b> were <b>scheduled</b> {{to join the}} Papel Passado program in 2012. Such a particular geographic location provides a unique context for our analysis. For example, during the first semester of 2008 a new elementary school {{was built in the}} area. Households from both communities have benefited from this new public policy initiative. Further, Jardim Canaã and DR have similar economic and social characteristics. There is no physical border between the two neighborhoods since they are geographically contiguous, they are both located 2.5 miles from downtown Osasco, and they have precisely the same access to Osasco’s main economic center. On the other hand, the geographical context increases the possibility of spillover effects (externalities of economic activity or processes that affect those who are not directly involved in Papel Passado).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} state level political reservation for two minority groups 9 ̆ 6 Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes 9 ̆ 6 on child labor in India. We estimate the effect of political reservation on child labor by exploiting the state variation in the share of seats reserved {{for the two groups}} in state legislative assemblies mandated by the Constitution of India. Using data from state and household level surveys on fifteen major Indian states, we find that at the <b>household</b> level, <b>Schedule</b> Tribe reservation decreases the incidence of child labor, while Scheduled Caste reservation increases the total number of children working. Our results survive a variety of robustness checks and potential explanations for the differential impact of SC and ST political reservation are also explored, including geographic isolation, caste fragmentation, support for the Congress Party, and decentralization of power...|$|R
40|$|The Census Bureau has {{proposed}} dropping the long census form from the 2010 census. Detailed data formerly {{collected on the}} long form would be collected in a very large ongoing survey: the American Community Survey (ACS). Full implementation of the ACS in three million <b>households</b> was <b>scheduled</b> to begin in 2003, {{but at this point}} may be postponed. The first national-level pilot test of the ACS was conducted with 700, 000 households over the calendar year of 2000. This ACS pilot test was called the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey, or C 2 SS. If the ACS is to replace the census long form, estimates for demographic characteristics that it collects should be consistent with estimates from the census. To test for consistency, staff compared estimates for demographic variables from the C 2 SS and Census 2000. Unexpectedly large differences were found betwee...|$|R
