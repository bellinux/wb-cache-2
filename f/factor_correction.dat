In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.|$|E
25|$|When {{households}} are not charged for the reactive power they consume {{there is almost}} no monetary incentive for them to install power <b>factor</b> <b>correction</b> equipment. This is generally the case today, as household electric meters do not measure apparent power but only real power. Adding power <b>factor</b> <b>correction</b> merely affects the reactive power supplied or drawn and not real power, so utility costs are unaffected. However if there are high-resistance lines connected between the utility meter and a relatively high load then the power as measured by the meter can be reduced by a small amount with power <b>factor</b> <b>correction.</b> Any such savings are usually insignificant.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} the fourth in a series on {{friction}} factors for sprinkler laterals. The widely used friction <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> F was developed by Christiansen for the hydraulic analysis of sprinkler laterals. A significant modification to this factor was the adjusted friction <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> Fa. The adjusted friction <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> can be used when the first sprinkler is {{a fraction of a}} full spacing from the lateral inlet. To design laterals with outlets and outflow at the downstream end, friction <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> G was developed with the corresponding adjusted friction <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> Ga. To calculate the average pressure head along a lateral, the average <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> FAVG and GAVG were developed.

40|$|Biliary {{clearance}} (CL b) {{is often}} underestimated by in vitro – in vivo extrapolation from sandwich‐cultured hepatocytes (SCHs). The {{objective of this}} study was to compare the performance of a universal <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> with transporter‐based <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> in correcting underestimation of CL b. The apparent in vitro CL b of a training set of 21 compounds was determined using the SCH model and extrapolated to apparent in vivo CL b (CL b, app). A universal <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> (10. 2) was obtained by a linear regression of the predicted CL b, app and observed in vivo CL b of training set compounds and applied to an independent test set (n = 20); the corrected CL b predictions of 13 compounds were within twofold error of observed values. Furthermore, two transporter‐based <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> (Organic anion transporting polypeptides/multidrug‐resistance‐related protein 2 and diffusion/P‐glycoprotein) were estimated by linear regression analysis of training set compounds. The applications of the two <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> to the test set resulted in improved prediction precision. In conclusion, both the universal <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> and transporter‐based <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> provided reasonable <b>corrections</b> of CL b values, which are often underestimated by the SCH model.

The <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> (defined to be the ratio of the line flux that would be observed neglecting scattering, to the actual observed line flux) is a function of position within the filament.
