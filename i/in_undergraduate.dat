40|$|Abstract: Mechanical {{engineering}} field requires engineers {{with more}} practical problem-solving experience and skills of thinking, working and acting creatively. But, {{how can we}} develop and encourage these important skills <b>in</b> <b>undergraduates?</b> This article describes a case of nurturing creativity <b>in</b> <b>undergraduates</b> through cooperation with enterprises. Through the study of cognitive learning and creativity, a series of educational procedures and strategies are presented, they involved in basic training of fostering creativity and higher-level training of developing creativity based on commercial projects. Questionnaires from students and the actual results demonstrate that the above strategies and methods for fostering creativity <b>in</b> mechanical engineering <b>undergraduates</b> have yielded good results and students benefit from them...|$|R

5|$|The {{synthesis}} of aspirin {{is classified as}} an esterification reaction. Salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride, an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's hydroxyl group into an ester group (R-OH → R-OCOCH3). This process yields aspirin and acetic acid, which is considered a byproduct of this reaction. Small amounts of sulfuric acid (and occasionally phosphoric acid) are almost always used as a catalyst. This method is commonly employed <b>in</b> <b>undergraduate</b> teaching labs.|$|E
5|$|Columbia {{is home to}} two pioneers <b>in</b> <b>undergraduate</b> campus radio broadcasting, WKCR-FM and CTV. WKCR, {{the student}} run radio station that {{broadcasts}} to the Tri-State area, {{claims to be the}} oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with Major Edwin Armstrong. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the very first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR wasn't a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room. The station has its studios {{on the second floor of}} Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at 4 Times Square in Midtown Manhattan. Columbia Television (CTV) is the nation's second oldest Student television station and home of CTV News, a weekly live news program produced by undergraduate students.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the relationship of self-resilience, academic self-concept and test anxiety <b>in</b> <b>undergraduates.</b> Method: The participants were 403 <b>undergraduates</b> <b>in</b> H, C University in G City, and K University in S City. Data were collected from March 1 to April 30, 2012, and analyzed using SPSS/WIN 18. 0. Results: The mean score per item for self-resilience was 2. 77. The mean academic self-concept score was 3. 17 and the mean score for test anxiety was 2. 38. Self-resilience showed a negative correlation with test anxiety (r=-. 186, p<. 001) and a positive correlation with academic self-concept (r=. 312, p<. 001). Academic self-concept showed a negative correlation with test anxiety (r=-. 353, p<. 001). Conclusion: The findings {{of this study indicate that}} self-resilience and academic self-concept enhancement programs should be developed to reduce test anxiety <b>in</b> <b>undergraduates</b> and that further study should be done on the effects of such programs...|$|R

5|$|With {{unprecedented}} {{growth in}} the 1960s, particularly <b>in</b> <b>undergraduate</b> numbers, the Student's Union eventually acquired larger premises in a new building in the Clifton area of the city, in 1965. This building was more spacious than the Victoria Rooms, which were now given over to the Department of Music. The new Union provides many practice and performance rooms, some specialist rooms, as well as three bars: Bar 100; the Mandela (also known as AR2) and the Avon Gorge. Whilst spacious, the Union building is thought {{by many to be}} ugly and out of character compared to the architecture {{of the rest of the}} Clifton area, having been mentioned in a BBC poll to find the worst architectural eyesores in Britain. The university has proposed relocating the Union to a more central location as part of its development 'masterplan'. More recently, plans for redevelopment of the current building have been proposed.|$|E
