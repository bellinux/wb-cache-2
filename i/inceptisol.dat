In a pot experiment, we measured the leaf SPAD value (i. e. an estimate of leaf chlorophyll concentration) of lupin and strawberry sequentially grown on a soil–sand mixture previously flooded for 30 days (SPADf value) and on a non-flooded (control) mixture (SPADc value). The amount of Fe 2 + released by the soil at day 58 {{and the increase in}} oxalate-extractable Fe (Feo) upon incubation in vials were larger on average for the <b>Inceptisols</b> than for the Vertisols.

All soils are usually rich in organic carbon, dystric at the Great Group level, with saturation base from 72 to 10 %, and with pH from subalcaline to acidic. Allophanic <b>Inceptisol</b> appears more intensely weathered than non-allophanic Inceptisols. Volcanic glass content is, in any case, negligible.

On the whole, the results emphasize the role of topography and the importance of Al-, Fe-amorphous compounds in expressing soil andic properties and allophane content versus the volcanic origin of parent material and the insufficiency of volcanic glass. The results also suggest that the occurrence of soil with andic properties and significant allophane content in hot and dry environments, like the Mediterranean climate in Sardinia, may be more widespread than expected...|$|E
50|$|Natchez {{soils are}} in the <b>Inceptisols</b> soil order. <b>Inceptisols</b> soils have {{developed}} in relatively young material that have an Ochric epipedon is rich in weatherable minerals. The term coarse-silty indicates that the subsoil has less than 18 percent clay with less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine. The term mixed suggests that no one mineral is over 60 percent. Thermic refers to an average annual soil temperature between 15 and 22 degrees Celsius (59 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit) and differs more than 5 degrees Celsius (9 °F) between winter and summer at 50 cm (20 inches) below the surface.|$|R

40|$|Long-term field {{experiments}} (3 – 4 years) {{were conducted}} to evaluate the residual effect of boron (B) fertilizer for oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) in an intensive crop rotation including two rice (Oryza sativa) crops per year. Experiments were conducted on four sites where the soil types were sandy, silty and clayey <b>Inceptisols,</b> and an Ultisol, located in the Zhejiang Province, Southeast China. Application of B fertilizer at rates of 1. 1, 1. 65 and 3. 3 kg B/ha {{in the first year}} showed a different residual effect on oilseed yield in successive years, but had only small positive effects on the rice grain yield at two sites. The residual effect of 1. 1 kg B/ha remained fully effective in correcting B deficiency in oilseed rape for 2 years in the <b>Inceptisols,</b> whereas the residual effect of 1. 65 kg B/ha continued to correct B deficiency for at least 3 years in both the <b>Inceptisols</b> and the Ultisol. Foliar application of B fertilizer generally corrected B deficiency for oilseed rape but showed limited residual effect in the following years after application. The decline in residual values of B from a single fertilizer addition was closely related to the soil and leaf B concentration. Soil available B also decreased dramatically with the advance of rotation, but a larger decrease was found at a depth of 20 – 40 -cm for the <b>Inceptisols</b> and the Ultisol. Thus, a more detailed understanding of the B cycling in the system is now needed to optimize management of B fertilizer...|$|R
