5|$|A {{division}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates nearly {{all aspects of the}} trucking industry. Truck drivers are limited by the number of daily and weekly hours they may drive, the roads and highways they may drive upon, and a lower legal definition of drunkenness. The Federal Highway Administration has established 0.04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be <b>driving</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of alcohol. States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers.

40|$|Ethnic/racial {{minorities}} in the United States are overrepresented in fatalities from motor vehicle crashes (MVC). Growing evidence indicates that there are differences among racial/ethnic groups in risk of involvement in fatal crashes.

Using data from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) and the FR 300 P Police Crash Report, this project explores differences in variables associated with traffic safety behavior and traffic law obedience between non-White and White road users (drivers, passengers, and pedestrians). Results indicate that there is a significant association between race/ethnicity and <b>driving</b> while <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of alcohol/drugs (DUI).

5000|$|The {{imminent}} threat to safety doctrine also constitutes exigent circumstances. The {{sole purpose of}} the blood alcohol *337 test is to facilitate prosecution of those <b>driving</b> while <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of an intoxicant. See sec. 343.305(2) (a) and 346.63(1), Stats. 1977. Further, sec. 345.24, Stats. 1977, provides that a person arrested for <b>driving</b> while <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of an intoxicant [...] "may not be released until four hours have elapsed."11 This severe treatment is dramatic evidence of the legislature's intent and recognition {{of the need to}} protect the public from drunken drivers. Undoubtedly, this provision was enacted to prevent drunken drivers from returning to the road while intoxicated. Presumably, this four-hour statutory limitation sought to provide an adequate time allowance for the arrested intoxicant's blood alcohol content to metabolize to a safer level, equal to or less than [...]05 percent. Restraining those drivers who pose a danger to themselves and the public for the four-hour statutory period constitutes a preventive measure, designed to promote public safety.|$|R
