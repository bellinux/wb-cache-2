5|$|The Submitting country column {{indicates}} {{the country that}} officially submitted the film to the Academy, and is not necessarily indicative of the film's main country of production. The original titles of the films are also mentioned, {{as well as the}} names of the directors and the languages used in the <b>dialogue</b> <b>track,</b> even though none of these elements is officially included in the nomination.|$|E
25|$|The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film {{is one of}} the Academy Awards {{handed out}} {{annually}} by the U.S.-based Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). It is given to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States of America with a predominantly non-English <b>dialogue</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The boxed set {{received}} an enthusiastic 4/5 review from Allmusic, citing its eclectic blend of genres and an appeal going beyond anime fans to [...] "any adventurous listener", but also {{mentioned that the}} spoken <b>dialogue</b> <b>tracks</b> detracted from its accessibility.|$|R
25|$|As known, all films {{produced}} {{inside the}} United States have been ineligible for {{consideration for the}} Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film regardless {{of the language of}} their <b>dialogue</b> <b>track.</b> This fact also included films produced in U.S. overseas possessions. However, Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States and used to be eligible due to Puerto Ricans having had American citizenship since 1917. Their best success in this award was receiving a nomination for Santiago, the Story of his New Life (1989). However, as of 2011, the Academy had decided not to allow submissions from the territory anymore.|$|E
25|$|Once {{production}} has finished, the film undergoes post production (provided a Post Production Building has been erected), where music, sound effects, subtitles, speech and titles {{can be added}} to the movie. Cuts and changes can also be made to the length and order of the scenes, making editing the film easier. The player can also record sounds and a <b>dialogue</b> <b>track</b> for each character in that particular scene. The game allows for lip-synching, matching the speech to the actors. However, this only works for short sound files, and only shows basic lip movements. Once the movie has been completed, it can be saved in a proprietary file format for transferring to other PC users, or WMV format for online sharing. Outstanding player-made films can be nominated for a Stanley, a version of the Oscars. Once the player has reached Level 3 in story mode, the publicity office becomes available. This allows actors to hold press conferences and organizes marketing for the player's movie. Once a publicity office is built, players can also choose an advertising budget when releasing a film. A heavily-advertised movie can make much more money, but using too much advertising can result in the movie being 'over-exposed'.|$|E

50|$|Colpix {{released}} Woody Allen's two standup albums (including {{two minutes}} of pantomime—all the listener hears is silence, laughter, silence), and also released a soundtrack album of Hanna-Barbera cartoons. It included actual <b>dialogue</b> <b>tracks</b> from Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear, and Pixie and Dixie, and the recording was narrated by Daws Butler, speaking {{in the voice of}} Huckleberry Hound.|$|R
25|$|When it was {{discovered}} that original production sound recordings had been lost, new dialogue and foley were recorded, but since Captain Kidd Brewer had died of a self-inflicted gunshot before he could return to re-loop his dialog, producers and editors had to lift his original <b>dialogue</b> <b>tracks</b> from the remaining optical-sound prints of the dailies. The Special Edition was therefore dedicated to his memory as a result.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} two <b>dialogue</b> state <b>tracking</b> models {{competing in the}} 2012 <b>Dialogue</b> State <b>Tracking</b> Challenge (DSTC). First, we detail a novel discriminative dialogue state tracker which directly estimates slot-level beliefs using deterministic state transition probability distribution. Second, we present a generative model employing a simple dependency structure to achieve fast inference. The models are evaluated on the DSTC data, and both significantly outperform the baseline DSTC tracker. ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Dialogue</b> <b>tracks</b> for the film, {{now being}} {{referred}} to as just Nasrudin, were recorded at this time. Actor Vincent Price was hired to perform {{the voice of the}} villain, Anwar (later renamed [...] "Zigzag"), originally assigned to Kenneth Williams. Sir Anthony Quayle was cast as King Nod. Price was hired to make the villain more enjoyable for Williams, as he was a great fan of Vincent Price's work and ZigZag was based on two people Williams hated.|$|R

50|$|The {{two films}} were edited down into one 95-minute feature {{courtesy}} of American International Pictures and {{released in the}} US in 1959 as Journey to the Lost City - with Seetha's dance scenes heavily trimmed, courtesy of the Hays Office. The negatives of Fritz Lang's original films {{were thought to be}} lost, but recently a set was rediscovered. Fantoma Films restored them to DVD format, producing one disc for each film. The discs contain both German and English <b>dialogue</b> <b>tracks,</b> plus other extras. They were released by Image Entertainment in 2001.|$|R

5000|$|Muppets Most Wanted: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack is a soundtrack album {{released}} by Walt Disney Records on March 18, 2014 for the musical comedy film Muppets Most Wanted. The soundtrack features six original songs, two re-recordings of popular Muppet songs ("The Muppet Show Theme" [...] and [...] "Together Again"), three cover versions of existing songs (Allen Toussaint's [...] "Working in the Coal Mine", Maroon 5's [...] "Moves Like Jagger", and Los del Río's [...] "Macarena (Bayside Boys Mix)"), an orchestral suite by Christophe Beck, five demos by Bret McKenzie, and eight <b>dialogue</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Animatics are a more {{elaborate}} {{version of a}} storyboard and include <b>dialogue,</b> sound <b>tracks</b> and voice overs that are intended to represent a more polished version of the final creative execution.|$|R
500|$|The CD itself {{contains}} short dialogue {{clips and}} musical tracks, {{some of which}} are remixes, from all the Rocky films. Notable though is that only three of its nineteen total tracks are from the Rocky Balboa film: two <b>dialogue</b> <b>tracks</b> and the Three 6 Mafia song [...] "It's a Fight" [...] (the UK version contains the additional track [...] "Still Here" [...] by Natasha Bedingfield). This has led some to categorize the CD as a compilation while others suggest that it is a soundtrack and that the use of past material simply reflects the film's extensive use of flashbacks.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Australian <b>dialogue</b> <b>track</b> {{was finally}} released in North America in 2000 {{in a limited}} theatrical reissue by MGM, the film's current rights holders. It has since been released in the US on DVD with the US and Australian soundtracks on separate tracks.|$|E
50|$|The Muppets are {{physically}} performed {{live in the}} show by the park's in-house puppeteers in synchronization to a pre-recorded <b>dialogue</b> <b>track.</b> The Muppets Studio and Muppet performers Steve Whitmire, Eric Jacobson, and Dave Goelz provided consultation, as well as recording the voices for their respective characters.|$|E

50|$|While this is {{a silent}} film, a version with post-synchronized <b>dialogue</b> <b>tracks</b> {{provided}} by voice actors — not Stan's or Ollie's actual voices — was created in 1969. L&H mimic Chuck McCann plays both Stan and Ollie in the talking version. McCann had his own local TV show in New York in the sixties where he used puppets of Stan and Ollie to entertain kids. He was also seen in the 1970s and 1980s television commercial for Amco windshield wipers, playing Oliver Hardy opposite Jim McGeorge, who played Stan(McGeorge did the Oliver Hardy voice in the Hanna-Barbera cartoon program of the 1960s).|$|R

50|$|The Cowboy Bebop Boxed Set {{includes}} four regular size CDs, one bonus Mini CD, and a 52-page booklet (in Japanese). The booklet includes interesting trivia, track listing, interviews, and lyrics. Disks 1, 2 and 3 contain new and previously released tracks from the series, performed by Seatbelts. Disk 4 contains live tracks from Seatbelts on tour, {{as well as}} some unreleased movie <b>tracks.</b> The <b>dialogue</b> <b>tracks</b> are not songs, rather, they are vocal samples taken directly from the Japanese version of the series. It was released on June 21, 2002, and is now out of production.|$|R
50|$|The British Film Institute, {{through their}} Flipside arm, will release the film on DVD and Blu-ray on 21 April 2014, with the {{original}} Glaswegian <b>dialogue</b> <b>track</b> restored.

50|$|On January 10, 2012, Shadowland Productions {{released}} the Phantom of the Opera: Angel of Music Edition, a two-disc DVD set featuring a newly recorded <b>dialogue</b> <b>track</b> with sound effects and original musical score. The film was also re-edited, combining elements from the 1925 version with the 1929 re-release. A 3D anaglyph version was included {{as an additional}} special feature.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, Ryan {{gathered}} multiple awards from Amazon.com for {{his work}} with Amazon Studios. These include Best Actor {{for his work}} for the lead character in Z-Man, {{as well as a}} dozen other side characters. He also won Best <b>Dialogue</b> <b>Track</b> for his direction and production of the film's acted dialogue, and earned another Semi-Finalist spot for Best Actor.|$|E
50|$|The soundtrack {{has been}} {{released}} on CD four times, the first two releases using the original LP masters rather than {{going back to the}} original music masters to compile a more complete soundtrack album with underscoring and complete versions of songs. The 1997 Rykodisc release included several quick bits of dialogue from the film between some of the tracks and has gone out of circulation. On 24 February 2004, a few short months after MGM released the movie on a 2-Disc Special Edition DVD, Varèse Sarabande reissued a newly remastered soundtrack album without the <b>dialogue</b> <b>tracks,</b> restoring it to its original 1968 LP format.|$|R
5000|$|A track will {{generally}} contain only one [...] "type" [...] {{or group of}} sound. A <b>track</b> that contains <b>dialogue</b> only contains <b>dialogue,</b> a <b>track</b> that contains music should only contain music. Many tracks may carry all the sound for one group.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{models for}} <b>dialogue</b> state <b>tracking</b> using recurrent neural networks (RNN). We present experiments {{on the standard}} <b>dialogue</b> state <b>tracking</b> (DST) dataset, DSTC 2. On the one hand, RNN models became {{the state of the}} art models in DST, on the other hand, most state-of-the-art models are only turn-based and require dataset-specific preprocessing (e. g. DSTC 2 -specific) in order to achieve such results. We implemented two architectures which can be used in incremental settings and require almost no preprocessing. We compare their performance to the benchmarks on DSTC 2 and discuss their properties. With only trivial preprocessing, the performance of our models is close to the state-of- the-art results.
