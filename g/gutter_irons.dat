50|$|Cast <b>iron</b> <b>gutters</b> were {{introduced}} in the late 18th century {{as an alternative to}} lead. Cast <b>iron</b> enabled eaves <b>gutters</b> to be mass-produced: they were rigid and non-porous while lead could only be used as a liner within timber gutters. Installation was a single process and didn't require heat. They could be attached directly to the fascia board. Cast <b>iron</b> <b>gutters</b> are still specified for restoration work in conservation areas, but are usually replaced with cast aluminium made to the same profile. Extruded aluminium gutters can be made to a variety of profiles from a roll of aluminium sheet on site in lengths of up to 30m. They feature internal brackets at 400mm spacing.|$|R
50|$|The Quay Lane {{elevation}} is not rendered, but has {{a similar}} composition of regularly spaced engaged piers with paired sash windows to each bay. The ground floor has four loading bays, three of which have cast <b>iron</b> <b>gutter</b> covers which are embossed with the firm's name.|$|R
50|$|The lantern lights {{running along}} the ridge line of each gabled roof consist of box-like {{structures}} with curved roofs of corrugated iron. Three reversible casement windows face both north and south on each lantern. Walls {{to the east and}} west are clad in ripple <b>iron.</b> <b>Gutters</b> are quad-profile.|$|R
2500|$|The initial Herty system {{utilized}} two v-shaped galvanized <b>iron</b> <b>gutters</b> {{to collect}} the resin. [...] The simplicity of the method allowed it to be taught to the existing workforce in the turpentine industry. Herty's method yielded more resin that was also higher in quality; however, the most important success of [...] this new method was that it lengthened the useful lifetime of the pine trees from {{only a few years}} to decades. This extended use not only saved the trees but the naval store industry as well. [...] Herty's less destructive collection method also allowed the trees to eventually be milled as lumber. Herty subsequently moved from an <b>iron</b> <b>gutter</b> to a ceramic one, and his involvement with the Chattanooga Pottery Company in the production of the ceramic gutters eventually {{led to the creation of}} the Herty Turpentine Cup Company in 1909.|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} dynamic {{simulation model}} of the molten iron flow field was presented in the paper with Fluent simulation software. Different operating parameters combinations, including different oxygen lance locations, oxygen pressures and oxygen flows, different arrangements of bottom blowing holes, hole sizes, nitrogen pressures and nitrogen flows were studied. It is shown that the relative optimum value of the distance from top-blow gun to the molten iron surface is 1500 mm, and bottom blowing hole diameter is 20 mm, {{there is no significant}} difference of the blowing effects found when comparing single ring arrangement with double rings arrangement of 8 bottom blowing holes with only bottom-blow, and the bottom-blow of inner ring is disturbed by top-blow when top and bottom combined blow. Optimized design results have been applied to the design and manufacture of the actual converter, the converter has been successfully used in plant. The actual production results indicate that the desiliconization precision can reach 0. 05 %, the content of Cr 2 O 3 in the slag after reduction can be less than 2 %, better than the technical requirements of 3 %, and improve the recovery rate of the chromium. Compared with traditional desiliconization method by <b>iron</b> <b>gutter</b> and <b>iron</b> ladle, desiliconization by converter does not use compression residue agents and reduce the amount of desiliconization agents and slag, and improve the desiliconization efficiency and productivity...|$|R
50|$|The Bosworth {{estate was}} {{purchased}} in 1885 by Charles Tollemache Scott, who made numerous {{improvements to the}} building and added his initials {{to some of the}} <b>iron</b> <b>guttering,</b> which can still be seen to this day. Among other changes Tollemache Scott made, the cellar gates were replaced with cell doors from the Newgate Prison in London. The gate is still there, situated {{at the entrance to the}} Newgate bar.|$|R
50|$|Waterproofing usually {{includes}} {{the use of}} bitumous asphalt, galvanized iron flashing, copings and a layer of corrugated metal roofing under the tiles. Although tarpaulin sheets and other waterproofing membranes can be commonly found spread over tile roofs and weighed down by bricks or timber members as an expedient measures. Galvanized <b>iron</b> <b>gutters</b> and downpipes complete the water removal system of traditional roofs. Water from the roofs are eventually drained off to the open surface drains.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the structural and glazing systems, {{a variety of other}} materials were used for the base of the building, the waterproofing, ornament, and other secondary functions. Bluestone, Buff Bedford Stone, North River brick, and Tennessee marble were used for the masonry work. For leaders and gutters throughout most of the building, copper flashing was used. In some areas cast iron was used for the <b>gutter</b> system. Cast <b>iron</b> was also used for sills, friezes, columns, railings, mullions, transom bars, and snowguards.|$|R
50|$|The {{one story}} {{structure}} is built in an English motif and served mostly as a waiting shelter. Doors and windows {{are made of}} wood with steel lintels. The tile roof has galvanized <b>iron</b> <b>gutters</b> and a brick chimney. The building features a wood cornice. The station could be heated by a wood-burning fireplace and had electric lighting. Windows are found on all sides and two doors are on the north, leading to the platform. The interior was originally furnished with wood benches and flip-top seats.|$|R
50|$|The house's southwesterly {{gable wall}} {{contains}} a thin engaged chimney flue that enabled the occupants {{to benefit from}} fireplaces in the cellar and on the main floor. This is also a rare example of such construction although it {{is known to have}} once been common throughout the region. The doorway at the corner leading to a cellar kitchen is original to the house as are the garret and granary window openings and frames. Wrought-iron fleur-de-lis beam anchors on both gables and <b>iron</b> <b>gutter</b> hangers are also distinctive surviving features.|$|R
50|$|The {{residence}} at 98 Mt Crosby Road has a short-ridge pyramid roof and is sheeted in corrugated iron. The front verandah has been removed. A section of side verandah {{on the southern}} {{side of the house}} remains with its iron lace balustrade, its posts, brackets and capitals, and an acroterian remains on at least one corner of the roof <b>guttering.</b> The <b>iron</b> lace is similar to or identical with that of the earlier house, Oaklands, at 100 Mt Crosby Road, and the brackets are similar or identical with those on the later house, Wrightson, at 106 Mt Crosby Road. Walls facing the former front verandah are single-skin, vertically-jointed boards with horizontal bracing. Under the main roof are 5 bedrooms, a sleepout, study, formal lounge with marble and tiled fireplace, dining room, living room, and a kitchen. A small hip-roof structure at the right of the house is sheeted in corrugated iron and may originally have functioned as a service wing or business office.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s {{the company}} {{focused more on}} {{rainwater}} and drainage products and a PVC underground drainage system {{was added to the}} portfolio in 1971. Hunters quickly gained a reputation for its superior rainwater systems and was the first company to launch gutter fittings that did not rely on adhesive to hold the rubber seals in place. By 1972 Hunter Plastics employed 364 staff. Throughout the 1970s Hunter was very successful - at the time PVCu was displacing traditional materials cast <b>iron</b> <b>gutters</b> and soil pipes, lead waste pipes, earthenware soil pipes and so the business grew every year as traditional materials lost market share.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of residential {{properties in the}} area are late Victorian and Edwardian back-to-back brick terraces or face onto wide streets with communal access alleyways at the rear. A small area of 1980s council housing lies between Hyde Park Road and Woodsley Road, these replaced terrace housing demolished due to slum clearance. Main roads are cambered and some still retain original Yorkstone pavements and <b>iron</b> <b>guttering.</b> However, Leeds City Council have been removing much of the stone paving and granite kerbs to be replaced by modern tarmac and concrete. A large number of houses in Hyde Park are owned by private landlords who rent to students.|$|R
50|$|Born in Holstebro {{in central}} Jutland, Hvidberg was a self-taught artist. In the early 1960s, he first painted in a Constructivist style {{inspired}} by Gunnar Aagaard Andersen {{and other members}} of the Linien II artists association. His sculptural creations were mobiles made of roof <b>gutters,</b> plexiglass and <b>iron</b> driven by electric motors with shining lights. One, developed together with William Soya, also had a sound and light component, predating later installations. His 1965 POEX exhibition combined avant-garde developments in art, poetry and drama. Hvidberg sought to give his mobiles associations with the cosmos and with ancient civilisations. While in Rome in the early 1979s, he again became interested in Symbolism which had characterized his early works with crosses and swastikas.|$|R
5000|$|Finlock gutters, a {{proprietary}} name for concrete gutters, {{can be employed}} on a large range of buildings. There were used on domestic properties in the 1950s and 1960s, {{as a replacement for}} cast <b>iron</b> <b>gutters</b> when there was a shortage of steel and surplus of concrete. [...] They were discredited after differential movement was found to open joints and allow damp to penetrate, but can be fitted with an aluminium and bitumastic liner. [...] Finlock concrete gutter units are made up of two troughs - one is the visible gutter and the other sits across the cavity wall. The blocks which can range from 8 to 12 in can be joined using reinforcing rods and concrete, to form lintels for doors and windows.|$|R
2500|$|Buxhall Mill had a domed {{cap with}} a gallery. It was [...] {{diameter}} and [...] high internally. The four Patent sails [...] had eleven bays of three shutters, and spanned [...] They were carried on stocks of [...] long, [...] square at the poll end. The sails were [...] long and [...] long. They were fitted with Catchpole's Air Brakes. These provided extra power in light winds, but acted {{as an effective}} air brake in strong winds. The windshaft weighed 38 cwt (1,930kg) and cost £38. 0. 0. new in 1860. The cap was winded by an eight bladed fantail. An unusual feature of this mill was the cast <b>iron</b> <b>gutter</b> around the curb, which collected rainwater from the cap and delivered {{it to the ground}} via a downpipe {{on the outside of the}} mill.|$|R

5000|$|The former Burns Philp {{building}} is a large timber-framed structure elevated on masonry and timber stumps and clad in vertically fixed corrugated iron sheeting. Behind a distinctive curved triple-fronted parapet facing south-east to Landsborough Street, the {{building is}} divided into three bays of varying width, each with a gabled roof and valley gutters running the length of the building. Two roof ventilators are positioned along the ridge of the middle bay. A timber-framed corrugated iron clad awning with ogee eaves gutter supported on posts (one early timber post survives) extends over each footpath. Two entrances are located on Caroline Street accessed by stairs and a connecting ramp. The kerbing to both streets is made from local stone and cast <b>iron</b> <b>gutter</b> covers inscribed with the words [...] "Normanton Municipal Council" [...] span the channel between the asphalt concrete road surface and concrete path to the footpath.|$|R
5000|$|The {{industrial}} revolution introduced {{new methods of}} casting-iron and the railways brought a method of distributing the heavy cast-iron item to building sites. The relocation into the cities created a demand for housing {{that needed to be}} compact. Dryer houses controlled asthma, bronchitis, emphysema as well as pneumonia. In 1849 Joseph Bazalgette proposed a sewerage system for London, that prevented run-off being channelled into the Thames. By the 1870s all houses were constructed with cast <b>iron</b> <b>gutters</b> and down pipes. The Victorian gutter was an ogee, 115mm in width, that was fitted directly to the fascia boards eliminating the need for brackets. Square and half-round profiles were also available. For a brief period after the first world war asbestos-cement guttering became popular due to it being maintenance free: the disadvantages however ensured this was a short period: it was more bulky and fractured on impact ...|$|R
50|$|This is a low-set, single-storeyed, timber-framed {{structure}} with hardwood slab walls and floors and a hipped roof of unlined corrugated iron. Adzed timber rafters and tie beams with few battens support this roof, and the galvanised <b>iron</b> <b>guttering</b> is of early half-round profile. The principal uprights are morticed and tenoned to {{a bottom plate}} and carry a top plate, and the whole rests on timber stumps. Split hardwood slabs, both vertical and horizontal, provide the infill between the frames. There are no internal doorways. Slab partitions to ceiling height divide the structure into three rooms, each of which opens onto a verandah which runs {{the length of the}} building on the southwest side. The outer edge of the verandah floor is carried by a ground log. The former kitchen features a cooking alcove and chimney of corrugated iron attached to the end wall. This alcove is clad externally with vertical slabs and has a stone floor. Beyond the kitchen a small iron-roofed lean-to supported by timber posts is attached {{to the rear of the}} fireplace. The building remains substantially intact and has been furnished as a private museum, illustrating a typical bedroom and kitchen of the pioneer era.|$|R
5000|$|From late 1889 {{until about}} 1895, {{there was a}} {{depression}} in Queensland. North Queensland suffered especially, due to a significant downturn in sugar production, and a drought, which peaked in 1889. This had a severe impact on the regional mining industry because the crushing mills needed water. Charters Towers and Croydon were affected and this had a flow-on effect for Burns Philp. Robert Philp had speculated on mining and real estate and had to sell his company shares and resign from the Board in 1893. It suffered a substantial decline in profitability, which in 1893 James Burns blamed on [...] "insane overstocking of Normanton five years ago" [...] with mining supplies. This included 300 pairs of bellows which {{are used in the}} dry-processing of gold. Despite the downturn, approval was given for the addition of a strongroom to the Normanton building, in late 1892. In January 1893 Burns Philp wrote to the Normanton Municipal Council requesting kerb and gutter be installed adjoining their store on Landsborough and Caroline Streets. The tender of £24 from local contractors Copeland and Cant for stone and concrete kerbing was accepted in February. It was installed ten feet past the side entrance to the Burns Philp store in Landsborough Street and {{to the end of the}} veranda in Caroline Street. The Council then requested the installation of spouting and gutters on the Burns Philp store. The cast <b>iron</b> <b>gutter</b> coves on the kerb were not tendered for at this time, and presumably were added later, reportedly manufactured at the Croydon foundry, operated by Messer's Stuart and Mackenzie between 1891 and 1912.|$|R
5000|$|By 1950, {{more than}} 2,000 {{families}} lived in temporary accommodation in Queensland paying rents per week ranging from 12 shillings and 6 pence ($1.25) for a one bedroom house {{to up to}} 27 shillings and 6 pence ($2.75) for a four bedroom house. In 1950, the average weekly wage was nearly £10 ($20). As well as establishing temporary camps, the Queensland Housing Commission was building new houses to try and meet the growing demand. Because of the limited supply of materials available locally, the Commission resorted to importing them. Cement was ordered from Czechoslovakia, iron sheeting from Belgium, timber from Finland and Sweden, and from England, roofing plus [...] "2,000 baths of excellent quality". Despite {{the efforts of the}} Queensland Government, the time taken to complete a single house contract, normally six to eight weeks, often exceeded six months because of the shortage of labour and building materials. The contract price for one of the first houses built to rent was £840 ($1,680). The quote covered land clearing, construction of a building of fibro-cement, a laundry, clothes line, built-in shelving and cupboards of 'first grade cypress pine', fences, water tank, polished hardwood floors, paint work and connection of water, gas and electricity. Because of the world-wide material shortages, builders sought help from the Queensland Government in securing scarce materials such as nails, roofing <b>iron,</b> <b>guttering</b> and galvanised piping. By mid-1945, the Commission had built 198 homes for rent. This had increased to 1,241 homes by mid-1948, but it was still not enough to overcome the crisis. The concept of importing houses pre-cut and ready to be erected was proposed and implemented. In 1958 a European termite was discovered in some of the imported timber 'pre-fab' houses. The risk of allowing the bug to spread throughout Queensland and Australia was too great. The Commission relocated thousands of families to fumigate their houses. In total, 2,643 houses were fumigated. Families had to be relocated into temporary accommodation while their homes were wrapped in canvas in preparation for fumigation. Eradicating the termite problem takes 17 months to complete and costs around £350,000 ($700,000).|$|R
