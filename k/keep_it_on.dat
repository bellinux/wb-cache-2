25|$|However, {{this was}} during {{an era of}} rapid shifts within the {{aviation}} industry. The winding-down of major purchases to feed the Vietnam War and Project Apollo was forcing the major aerospace firms to seek ways to diversify, and the government was actively funding a number of mass transit projects in partnership with them. Rivers changed the focus to be a show about any form of transit, not just aircraft, and the size and cost started to increase. He won an initial appropriation of $3 million for the show, but {{had to return to}} Congress for another $2 million to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> track as its scale rapidly increased. Critics, notably William Proxmire, attacked the event and claimed that the actual costs would be closer to $10 million when industry input was considered.|$|E
25|$|For a bead sliding on a {{frictionless}} wire subject only {{to gravity}} in 2d space, the constraint on the bead can be {{stated in the}} form f(r) = 0, where {{the position of the}} bead can be written r = (x(s), y(s)), in which s is a parameter, the arc length s along the curve from some point on the wire. This is a suitable choice of generalized coordinate for the system. Only one coordinate is needed instead of two, because the position of the bead can be parameterized by one number, s, and the constraint equation connects the two coordinates x and y; either one is determined from the other. The constraint force is the reaction force the wire exerts on the bead to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the wire, and the non-constraint applied force is gravity acting on the bead.|$|E

25|$|The first {{skirmish}} {{establishing the}} Texas Revolution began in early October 1835, at the Battle of Gonzales. The Texians would be {{challenged by the}} Mexican army, {{when they tried to}} retake possession of an artillery piece at Gonzales, Texas. It was a small cannon, formerly given them by Mexico, which had been used for security against the Native Indians. Texians considered this action as an infringement of their right to bear arms and were determined to <b>keep</b> <b>it.</b> <b>On</b> October 2, they would show that determination. During this time, a meeting would be held at Salvador Flores Ranch that would organize a volunteer force of Texas ranchers that would favor the impending revolution. Soldiers continued gathering, immigrants, colonists, native Texans. The Texian Army would become a mixture of all peoples, interested in freedom from the oppressive policies of Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Creep" [...] {{is set in}} {{the time}} {{signature}} of common time with a moderate tempo of 96 beats per minute. It was composed in the traditional verse–chorus form in the key of C minor with Watkins and Thomas' vocals ranging from the chords of C4 to F5. [...] "Yes, it's me again / And, I'm back," [...] Watkins introduces herself while opening the track in a [...] "husky" [...] voice. She then repeats the lines [...] "oh-I, oh-I, oh-I", which was compared by Spin Terry Sutton to Watkins finding [...] "a spiritual instruction in vowel sounds," [...] before going to the first verse of the song. In the first verse, the singer counts her relationship's [...] "twenty-second of loneliness" [...] and expresses how she still loves her boyfriend even acknowledging that he has been cheating on her. Moving on to the song's bridge, she suddenly uses a lower register to [...] "nonchalantly" [...] reveal: [...] "I'll never leave him down, though I might mess around / It's only cause I need some affection." [...] "So I creep / Yeah / And I'll just <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the down low," [...] she low-key sings the hook as if she is [...] "confessing to a chosen few." [...] Opening up the second verse, Watkins again counting her [...] "twenty-third of loneliness" [...] and still talks about her love for the partner despite signs of a broken romance. After performing the chorus again, her fellow member Thomas joins in to [...] "sweetly" [...] reveal the reason why's she cheating around is because she needs some attention from her lover. Watkins finally ends the track with the lines [...] "I creep around because I need attention / I don't mess around with my affection" [...] while fading out with the heavy beat and the horn sample. Billboard Larry Flick said the two's vocals in the track were [...] "tightly woven" [...] and [...] "rife with raspy grit," [...] which gave a nice contrast to the song's horn sample and funk guitars.|$|E

500|$|Time magazine, {{music critic}} Robert Christgau and AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine all {{declared}} the track {{as one of}} CrazySexyCool best. [...] "In many ways, TLC at least musically, were best when {{they were the most}} subtle," [...] commented Complex Michael Arceneaux. In addition, the writer also found the track's content to be [...] "refreshing" [...] for displaying women [...] "muddy up right and wrong in a relationship." [...] From the same publication, Benjamin Chesna and Edwin Ortiz gave credits to the song for making infidelity sound [...] "empowering" [...] while praising Austin's [...] "silky smooth production," [...] concluding their article with a claim: [...] " [...] forced you into the arms of another lady, now you just have to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the down low." [...] Slant Magazines editor Sal Cinquemani was reviewing the greatest hits album 20 when he observed that both of the girls' [...] "finest" [...] singles, [...] "Creep" [...] and [...] "Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg", had them [...] "proudly flipping accepted modes of female sexual behavior and consent on their heads." [...] To boot the idea, Idolator journalist Robbie Daw explained the song's [...] "staying power" [...] was perhaps owed {{to the fact that it}} was a [...] "provocative" [...] track dared to expose the [...] "taboo, down-low" [...] aspects of a relationship. In the 2014 biopic CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story, [...] "Creep" [...] was served as the backdrop to a dramatic scene where Lopes' character set her then-boyfriend Rison's bathtub filled with tennis shoes on fire and destroyed their joint mansion due to his infidelity. Vibe Clover Hope watched the whole scene and realized how [...] "perfectly sexy and unapologetic" [...] the song was at the time of its first releasing. In contrary, one of Pitchfork contributors, Jess Harvell, felt its lyrics were [...] "unconscionable," [...] instead, he praised the song's groove that was [...] "so seductive you barely register what you're singing along to." [...] Harvell continued to say that Austin even managed to make scratching, [...] "that emblem of noisy hip-hop ruckus", sound [...] "smooth." [...] "No mean feat.," [...] he gave out an endnote. With Charles Aaron's review for Spin, he fictionalized a short story:After that, Aaron also went on to call the track as a whole a [...] "commercial/artistic apex" [...] for the producer. Including it on her list of best tracks that make people dance, Bernadette McNulty from The Telegraph claimed: [...] "The Dallas Austin groove on this is so deep, it might give you vertigo." [...] Ebony writer Michael A. Gonzales agreed, he said the girls' song [...] "put the sonic scientist that much closer to [...] dreams of making tracks as enticing and sexy as the ones his hero Prince created for Vanity 6 and Apollonia 6." [...] Music critic Smokey Fontaine even named the track Austin's best work: [...] "Here, the harmonies worked, the bass line was hard enough to compete in a hip-hop world, and for a moment, R didn't need a guest rapper." ...|$|E
