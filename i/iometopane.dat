50|$|The {{radiopharmaceutical}} {{forms of}} RTI-55, {{in which the}} iodine atom is radioiodine so that the drug {{can be used in}} single-photon emission computed tomography, are called <b>iometopane</b> I 123 (USAN) or <b>iometopane</b> 123I (INN) and <b>iometopane</b> I 125 (USAN) or <b>iometopane</b> 125I (INN). The 123I and 125I isotopes are favored because they are very-high-energy Î³-ray emitters.|$|E
50|$|AEME is {{also used}} in {{scientific}} research for the manufacture of phenyltropane analogues such as troparil, dichloropane, <b>iometopane,</b> and CFT. Methylecgonidine could also theoretically be used to produce cocaine and so may be a controlled substance in some countries.|$|E
5000|$|RTI-55 {{is mainly}} used in {{scientific}} {{research into the}} dopamine reuptake transporter. Various radiolabelled forms of RTI-55 (with different radioactive isotopes of iodine used depending on the application) are used in both humans and animals to map the distribution of dopamine transporters and serotonin transporters in the brain. [...] The 123I derivative is known as <b>iometopane.</b>|$|E
5000|$|RTI(-4229)-55, {{also called}} RTI-55 or <b>iometopane,</b> is a phenyltropane-based {{psychostimulant}} used in {{scientific research and}} in some medical applications. This drug was first cited in 1991. RTI-55 is a non-selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor derived from methylecgonidine. However, more selective analogs are derived by conversion to [...] "pyrrolidinoamido" [...] RTI-229, for instance. Due to the large bulbous nature of the weakly electron withdrawing iodo halogen atom, RTI-55 is the most strongly serotonergic of the simple para-substituted troparil based analogs. In rodents RTI-55 actually caused death at a dosage of 100 mg/kg, whereas RTI-51 and RTI-31 did not. Another notable observation is the strong propensity of RTI-55 to cause locomotor activity enhancements, although in an earlier study, RTI-51 was actually even stronger than RTI-55 in shifting baseline LMA. This observation serves to highlight the disparities that can arise between studies.|$|E
