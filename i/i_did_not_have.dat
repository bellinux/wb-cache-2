5|$|George I died on 11/22 June 1727 {{during one}} of his visits to Hanover, and George II succeeded him as king and elector at the age of 43. The new king decided not to travel to Germany for his father's funeral, which far from {{bringing}} criticism led to praise from the English who considered it proof of his fondness for England. He suppressed his father's will because it attempted to split the Hanoverian succession between George II's future grandsons rather than vest all the domains (both in Britain and Hanover) in a single person. Both British and Hanoverian ministers considered the will unlawful, as George <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the legal power to determine the succession personally. Critics supposed that George II hid the will to avoid paying out his father's legacies.|$|E

I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E

500|$|In the season-ending RAC Rally in Great Britain, Mouton {{continued}} her good performances by running third at half distance, despite having been uncomfortable about competing in a rally where pacenotes and practice are not allowed. However, her Quattro later incurred gearbox problems and she retired from fifth place after sliding {{off the road}} into a snow-filled ditch. Mouton would later state: [...] "For me, rallying is England. No pacenotes – just you in the car having to do the fastest time. This, to me, is rallying. OK, {{it was not easy}} for me because <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> experience there of the British championship, but it is really rallying. I like it very much."

500|$|In {{the moment}} of surrender, I let go of all the {{theological}} or social questions which had kept me from [...] for countless years. I simply let them go. There was the sense, profound and wordless, that if He knew everything <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to know everything, and that, in seeking to know everything, I'd been, all of my life, missing the entire point. No social paradox, no historic disaster, no hideous record of injustice or misery should keep me from Him. No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment {{over the fate of}} this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand between me and Him. The reason? It was magnificently simple: He knew how or why everything happened; He knew the disposition of every single soul. He wasn't going to let anything happen by accident! Nobody {{was going to go to}} Hell by mistake." ...|$|E

It rapidly intensified after its upgrade, and reached its peak intensity of [...] late on September 21. The storm was small with an asymmetric wind field, and wind shear displaced the circulation from the deep convection. Increasing wind shear prevented Helene from attaining hurricane status, and the storm began weakening on September 22 as it approached the northern Gulf Coast. By 0900UTC that day, strong wind shear moved the convection away from the center and toward the north and northeast.

500|$|Much of {{her early}} career {{is filled with}} near misses in casting, as she was up for {{significant}} roles in films such as 1997's The Postman and The Devil's Advocate and 2000's Meet the Parents, which eventually went to other actresses. In an interview in 2012, Watts said, [...] "I came to New York and auditioned {{at least five times}} for Meet the Parents. I think the director liked me but the studio didn't. I heard every piece of feedback you could imagine, and in this case, it was 'not sexy enough'." [...] Watts recalled her early career in an interview in 2002, saying, [...] "It is a tough town. I think my spirit has taken a beating. The most painful thing has been the endless auditions. Knowing that you have something to offer, but not being able to show it, is so frustrating. As an unknown, you get treated badly. I auditioned and waited for things <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any belief in, but I needed the work and had to accept horrendous pieces of shit."

500|$|Percy {{has been}} {{variously}} {{described as a}} belligerent and eccentric man, with [...] "surges of wild energy subsiding into sloth". [...] The Jesuit priest Father John Gerard wrote that in his youth Percy had [...] "been very wild more than ordinary, and much given to fighting", while the Jesuit Oswald Tesimond thought he had been [...] "rather wild and given to the gay life, a man who relied much on his sword and personal courage." [...] According to both men, Percy's conversion to Catholicism was a calming influence, but biographer Mark Nicholls, who calls Percy [...] "a pugnacious character", says that this was only true to a point. [...] His excesses did not prevent him from joining Northumberland during his command in the Low Countries, held from 1600–1601, {{for which he was}} rewarded with £200. [...] The earl also appointed Percy his receiver of rents in Cumberland and Northumberland, in 1603. [...] Henry Percy was considered a supporter of the Catholic cause, and on several occasions before 1603, suspecting that Queen Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> long to live, he entrusted Thomas with the delivery of secret correspondence to and from her probable successor, King James VI of Scotland. [...] Northumberland's uncle had been executed for his involvement in the Rising of the North, a plot to replace Elizabeth with James's mother, Mary, Queen of Scots. [...] He planned to make up for his family's disgrace by building a strong relationship with James, but also wished to counter the influence of Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, whose father (it was rumoured) James believed had been responsible for Mary's death.|$|E

2500|$|The {{unsolicited}} screenplay {{was written}} by two novice writers, actor Gregory Fleeman and documentarian Robert T. Megginson. Producer Jack Wiener read their script, which was submitted as a low-budget television movie, and felt {{that it should be}} made into a theatrical release. Wiener and his co-producer Dodi Fayed hired Robert Mandel, an Off-Broadway director. They did not want to hire an action director, but instead wanted a director who would bring a realistic touch to the film and make the audience care about the main character. Mandel accepted the job because he wanted to dispel the perception that he was a [...] "soft, arty director". Initially he was not impressed with the film's screenplay, which he felt was not well-crafted but felt that it provided for [...] "a lot of action and a lot of things <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> under my belt".

2500|$|In 1966, Bhosle's {{performances}} in the duets from one of music director R.D. Burman's first soundtracks, for the movie Teesri Manzil, won popular acclaim. Reportedly, when she first heard the dance number [...] "Aaja Aaja", she felt {{she would not be}} able to sing this westernised tune. While Burman offered to change the music, she refused, taking it as a challenge. She completed the song after ten days of rehearsals, and [...] "Aaja Aaja", along with such other songs as [...] "O Haseena Zulfonwali" [...] and [...] "O Mere Sona Re" [...] (all three duets with Rafi), became successful. Shammi Kapoor, the film's leading actor, was once quoted as saying– [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> Mohammad Rafi to sing for me, I would have got Asha Bhosle to do the job". Bhosle's collaboration with Burman resulted in numerous hits and a marriage. During the 1960-70s, she was the voice of Bollywood's actress and dancer, Helen, on whom [...] "O Haseena Zulfon Wali" [...] was picturised.
