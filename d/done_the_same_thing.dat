5|$|In 1534, Cromwell {{initiated}} a Visitation of the Monasteries ostensibly {{to examine their}} character, but in fact, to value their assets {{with a view to}} expropriation. The Crown was undergoing financial difficulties, and the wealth of the church, in contrast to its political weakness, made appropriation of church property both tempting and feasible. Suppression of monasteries to raise funds was not unknown previously.

5|$|Krug {{strongly}} opposed {{the notion that}} libraries ought to censor the material that they provide to patrons. She supported laws and policies protecting the confidentiality of library use records. When the United States Department of Justice used {{the authority of the}} USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 to conduct searches of once-confidential library databases, Krug raised a public outcry against this government action. When shortly after the September 11 attacks a Florida librarian told police that one of the attackers had been using the Delray Beach public libraryalthough Florida law guarantees confidentiality to library patronsKrug criticized the action. She stated she wished the librarian had adhered to Florida law, but empathized with the situation and said that most individuals would likely have <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E

Harley Quinn has the Joker sent back to the prime universe after realizing that he does not care about her, Green Lantern hands over his counterpart and Sinestro to the Guardians of the Universe to stand trial, and Wonder Woman dethrones her counterpart. The dictator Superman is placed in a prison emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless, and his prime counterpart admits that if he were placed in the same position, he might have <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> The alternate Batman tells Superman that he hopes that Superman never has to learn what he could be capable of if he turns evil, and warns him that if something ever happens to him, causing him to go down the path of his counterpart, he will come after him. As they walk away, the alternate Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he still has some degree of his powers.|$|E

25|$|Kürd Mehmed {{took for}} himself Abaza Hasan's former post as voyvoda of the Yeni Il Türkmen, and {{subsequently}} sought to undermine Ibşir Pasha's other former supporters. One {{of these was}} Seydi Ahmed Pasha, who had recently been appointed governor of Karaman. While Seydi {{was on his way}} to the provincial capital, Konya, Kürd Mehmed entered the city and convinced the population to resist the incoming governor, warning of his tyranny. Thus when Seydi arrived, he found the city armed against him with Kürd Mehmed organizing its defense. This led to an alliance between Seydi Ahmed and Abaza Hasan, as the two of them besieged Konya together, driving Kürd Mehmed out of the city. Yet by this time, orders had arrived from Istanbul removing Seydi from his post and assigning him to Aleppo instead. When Seydi and Abaza Hasan arrived, they found that Kürd Mehmed had <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> there as well, rallying the population of Aleppo to defend the city against them. Ultimately, Aleppo fell into Seydi's hands and Kürd Mehmed fled to Adana, where he and his men were killed.|$|E

500|$|Producer Ron Hauge came up {{with the}} idea of someone {{shooting}} a bird and feeling guilty about it. Hauge told the staff a few weeks before Cohen started writing the episode that when he was 13 or 14 years old, he accidentally killed a bird after he got a Wrist Rocket slingshot, and took a shot at a bird that he thought was [...] "far, far away". Hauge said his friends were excited about it, but he was [...] "dying inside". For the scene in which the bird is killed, Cohen received further inspiration from an episode of The Andy Griffith Show entitled [...] "Opie the Birdman". The writers were trying to figure out a way to have Bart kill the bird without actually wanting to kill it, and decided to give the gun a crooked sight that Bart would be unaware of, so when Bart intentionally takes a shot at the right of the bird to avoid it, the bullet still hits the bird. After Bart kills the mother bird, he imagines himself before a bird court with a vulture, an eagle, and a toucan as judges. This sequence was added to [...] "liven up the visuals", because the writers thought the episode tended too heavily towards extreme realism and because most of the scenes in the episode were taking place in and around the Simpsons' house. Then-show runner Mike Scully had <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> with an episode he wrote for season seven called [...] "Marge Be Not Proud". In that episode, Bart gets caught shoplifting, and writer Bill Oakley suggested the addition of a fantasy sequence to get away from the realism in the episode.|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} is often asked, how {{the cab and}} omnibus proprietors take to these innovations. Of course not very kindly, but experience shows that these individuals are more frightened than hurt. At first {{there is a little}} loss of revenue to the cabmen, but in the end the result is no worse, as people get educated to riding everywhere, and cabs get a fair share. The railways were said to have struck a death-blow at the ordinary vehicle traffic, but such did not prove to be true, and, wherever tramways have opened there has been no decrease in the numbers of cabs - Leicester for instance. Since the company have been running per timetable, the bus proprietors have <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> along St. Ann's Well-road, and with good result. For the comfort of the shareholders of the company, it may be stated that the directors will no doubt pay in July (with the interim dividend paid in February), a dividend at the rate of six per cent per annum. When this is taken into full consideration - that is to say, when all the difficulties are duly allowed for, and it is remembered that only a portion of the line is as yet opened - the result is most satisfactory. Indeed all the shares are now quoted at two per cent premium with few vendors. As to the character of the company, I think it is not undue flattery {{to say that it is}} efficiently and economically managed as the staff is limited to the mere necessary officials, and the directorate is small. Considering the rail employed is one that is sure to result in great saving to the shareholders, seeing that there will be little or no cost of repairs, and taking into consideration also the fact that the tramway route is populous, and the working expenses small, there is every reason to prophecy success to the company [...] [...] [...] As far as we can make out the estimated weekly receipts of the Tramway Company amount to about £350, and in Whit week we believe as much as £430 was taken, for which upwards of 50,000 people were carried. Taking £350 as the average weekly receipts gives a total of over £17,000 in a year, which is a very large sum indeed for the present branch of tramway service in a town of such proportions as Nottingham [...] [...] [...] There are 212 cabs in the town, so that estimating the earnings at but £2 per week there is a total of £424 weekly, or £20,000 a year. Taking the above as a very moderate estimate, and making a little allowance for omnibuses, 'carriers' carts, , it is fair to suppose that at least £40,000 a year is spent in Nottingham for passenger traffic.|$|E
