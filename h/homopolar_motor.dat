40|$|Abstract. The U. S. Navy {{has been}} {{developing}} superconducting <b>homopolar</b> <b>motors</b> for ship propulsion since 1969, initially using conventional NbTi superconducting material for the magnets. With the advent of high critical temperature (high Tc) superconductors, NbTi {{has been replaced by}} bismuth-strontium-calcium-copper-oxide (BSCCO). Performance of these motors depends critically on the properties of the superconducting material specifically of the magnitude of the current density and its stability with time. Flux creep is a major concern in these materials, since it limits high Tc superconductor performance at temperatures above about 30 K. As is well known these properties are strongly influenced by the high Tc superconductor microstructure. The level of current transport in a given high Tc superconductor depends upon several intrinsic microstructure-property relationships. In the typical orthorhombic crystal structure, superconducting current flows primarily in the a-b planes. In polycrystalline materials, superconducting current drops off as grain boundary misorientation increases. High current densities in polycrystalline materials needs strong c-axis alignment where current is expected to flow through those grains connected by low angle boundaries. When a magnetic field is applied, the flux vortices may shift due to the force from the current or to thermal activation, resulting in a loss of superconducting properties known as flux creep. Flux vortices may be pinned by microstructural defects such as grain boundaries or dislocations, if present in sufficient quantities, hence the importance of microstructure. The present paper deals with the microstructural aspects of superconductivity, specifically the role played by microstructure in determining superconducting properties. Examples from both the low and high Tc materials will be cited and future trends discussed...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{preliminary}} analytical and numerical study of one of the simpler members of a hierarchy of N (where N ≥ 1) coupled self-exciting Faraday disk <b>homopolar</b> dynamos, incorporating <b>motors</b> as additional electrical elements driven by the dynamo-generated current, as proposed by Hide (1997). The hierarchy is a generalisation of a single disk dynamo (N = 1) with just one electric motor in the system, and crucially, incorporating effects due to mechanical friction in both the disk and the motor, as investigated by Hide et al. (1996). This is describable by a set of three coupled autonomous nonlinear ordinary differential equations, which, due to the presence of the motor, has solutions corresponding to co-existing periodic states of increasing complexity, as well as to chaotic dynamics. We consider the case of two such homopolar dynamos (N = 2) with generally dissimilar characteristics but coupled together magnetically, with the aim of determining the extent to which this coupled system differs in its behaviour from the single disk dynamo with a series motor (Hide et al. 1996). In the case when the units are identical, the behaviour of the double dynamo system (after initial transients have decayed away) is identical to that of the single dynamo system, with solutions (including "synchronised chaos") locked in both amplitude and phase. When there is no motor in the system and the coefficient of mechanical friction in the disks is small, these transients resemble the well-known 'non-synchronous', but structurally unstable Rikitake solution.
