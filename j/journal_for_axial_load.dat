40|$|In this work, a {{mathematical}} model is developed for simulating the vibrations of a single flexible cylinder under crossflow. The flexible tube is subjected to an <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> and has loose supports. The equation governing {{the dynamics of the}} tube under the influence of fluid forces (modeled using quasi-steady approach) is a partial delay differential equation (PDDE). Using the Galerkin approximation, the PDDE is converted into a finite number of delay differential equations (DDE). The obtained DDEs are used to explore the nonlinear dynamics and stability characteristics of the system. Both analytical and numerical techniques were used for analyzing the problem. The results indicate that, with high <b>axial</b> <b>loads</b> and <b>for</b> flow velocities beyond certain critical values, the system can undergo flutter or buckling instability. Post flutter instability, the amplitude of vibration grows until it impacts with the loose support. With a further increase in the flow velocity, through a series of period doubling bifurcations the tube motion becomes chaotic. The critical flow velocity is same with and without the loose support. However, the loose support introduces chaos. It was found that when the <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> is large, the linearized analysis over-estimates the critical flow velocity. For certain high flow velocities, limit cycles exist <b>for</b> <b>axial</b> <b>loads</b> beyond the critical buckling load...|$|R

The seismic problem is described by a linear partial differential equation of seismic motion with variable coefficients. This equation is decoupled by using the exact vibration modes which are obtained by applying the Frobenius method. By this way, the seismic response can be evaluated in terms of superposition of modal contributions. The proposed formulation is applied to the seismic analysis of a realistic slender bridge pier.

The accuracy of the numerical results will depend not only on roundoff and algorithmic errors, but additionally on the approximations made in computing the incremental (second order) work associated in computing the change of configuration from the unbuckled to the buckled state. Here we show that, particularly for orthotropic thick sandwich structures, large errors can be incurred in computing buckling loads with available commercial software, unless the proper work conjugate measures of stress and strain with their stress-dependent tangential moduli are used in the buckling formulation.

In this paper, the potential of active buckling control of an imperfect beam-column with circular cross-section using piezo-elastic supports is investigated numerically.

With the piezo-elastic supports, active bending moments in arbitrary directions orthogonal to the beam-column's longitudinal axis can be applied at both beam- column's ends. The imperfect beam-column is loaded by a gradually increasing axial compressive force resulting in a lateral deformation of the beam-column. First, a finite element model of the imperfect structure for numerical simulation of the active buckling control is presented.

40|$|Buckling of axially loaded beam-columns {{represents}} a critical design constraint for light-weight structures. Besides passive solutions {{to increase the}} critical buckling load, active buckling control provides a possibility to stabilize slender elements in structures. So far, buckling control by active forces or bending moments has been mostly investigated for beam-columns with rectangular cross-section and with a preferred direction of buckling. The proposed approach investigates active buckling control of a beam-column with circular solid cross-section which is fixed at its base and pinned at its upper end. Three controlled active lateral forces are applied near the fixed base with angles of 120 ° to each other to stabilize the beam-column and allow higher critical <b>axial</b> <b>loads.</b> The beam-column is subject to supercritical static <b>axial</b> <b>loads</b> and lateral disturbance forces with varying directions and offsets. Two independent modal state space systems are derived for the bending planes in the lateral y- and z-directions of the circular cross-section.

It {{has been reported that}} about 75 % of aerospace structures fail due to fatigue cyclic loading. The civil-structural components are subjected to some form of <b>axial</b> and transverse <b>loading</b> which continuously deteriorates the health of the structure.

Thus for ACM structures, effective monitoring through-out the entire life is required as these often involve public life and huge investments. Owing to such necessity, researchers around the world are continuously working on the development of smart sensor based effective monitoring techniques. Piezo electric (PZT) transducer based electromechanical impedance (EMI) is one such technique which was developed for structural health monitoring (SHM). In this technique, PZT transducers are usually attached to the structure to be monitored and are then subjected to unit sinusoidal electric voltage to generate the electromechanical (EM) admittance signatures when interrogated to the desired frequency range of excitations. These signatures consist of real (conductance) and imaginary (susceptance) parts which serve as indicator to predict the structural health.
