REA typing {{was performed by}} two extraction methods for 1, 965 C. difficile isolates obtained from patients with symptomatic C. difficile disease, asymptomatic patients who were C. difficile culture positive, and environmental surfaces. This isolate collection yielded 206 unique REA types, which were organized into 75 groups. A reference strain representing each unique REA type was chosen for DNA band pattern comparisons, cytotoxin testing, and plasmid analysis. The DNA band patterns utilizing a guanidine thiocyanate-EDTA-Sarkosyl DNA extraction method were 94 % reproducible, while the original and sporadically problematic <b>diethyl</b> pyrocarbonate-sodium dodecyl <b>sulfate</b> DNA extraction method was 98 % reproducible when readable patterns were obtained. Reference strains from 43 of the 75 groups were cytotoxin positive, 28 groups were cytotoxin negative, and 4 groups included both toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains. Cytotoxicity of isolates with a particular REA type was always consistent with the toxicity of the reference strain for that type. REA typing was able to discriminate strain differences within types identified by the immunoblot (89 isolates), bacteriophage-bacteriocin (44 isolates), and ribotyping (23 isolates) methods.

40|$|Cultured Chinese hamster ovary {{cells were}} treated with ethylating agents. DNA lesions giving rise to single-strand breaks (ssb) or alkali-labile sites were {{measured}} by centrifugation in alkaline sucrose gradients after lysis in alkali. 4 agents with different tendencies to ethylate preferentially either at N or O atoms were compared, namely N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG), N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS) and diethyl sulphonate (DES). The compounds differed greatly in their potency to induce the lesions measured when compared on a molar basis, but comparison at equicytotoxic doses showed relatively small differences. Upon prolonged incubation of the DNA in alkali, the number of ssb increased considerably. DNA from untreated cells showed biphasic kinetics: slow ssb formation for about 10 h, then the rate increased and remained constant for up to 40 h. Treated cells showed an accelerated, dose-dependent linear generation of ssb for 10 h, followed by a short plateau; then ssb were formed again at a constant rate, somewhat higher than that in controls. Ssb formed in the initial phase are ascribed to phosphotriester hydrolysis, those after the plateau to unidentified causes. Zero intercepts {{appeared to be a}} measure of apurinic sites generated intracellularly. A 24 -h repair period preceding lysis reduced the ENNG intercept, but not that of DES. Rapid degradation of DES during the 1 -h treatment occurred, so most 'apurinic-site lesions' were induced in the beginning of exposure and possibly were already repaired at the end. The types of lesion distinguished (reparable and non-reparable apurinic sites, phosphotriesters) appeared of little consequence for cell survival.
