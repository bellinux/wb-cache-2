2500|$|Suppose some fixed, {{external}} {{potential energy}} [...] generates a conservative force [...] (for example, an electric force) on a particle located {{at a given}} position [...] We assume that the particle would respond by moving with velocity [...] Now assume {{that there are a}} large number of such particles, with local concentration [...] {{as a function of the}} position. After some time, equilibrium will be established: particles will pile up around the areas with lowest potential energy , but still will be spread out to some extent because of diffusion. At equilibrium, there is no net flow of particles: the tendency of particles to get pulled towards lower , called the drift current, perfectly balances the tendency of particles to spread out due to diffusion, called the <b>diffusion</b> <b>current</b> (see drift-diffusion equation).|$|E
50|$|It is {{necessary}} to consider the part of <b>diffusion</b> <b>current</b> when describing many semiconductor devices.

40|$|The Lifshitz {{theory of}} {{dispersion}} forces leads to thermodynamic and experimental inconsistencies when {{the role of}} drifting charge carriers {{is included in the}} model of the dielectric response. Recently modified reflection coefficients were suggested that take into account screening effects and <b>diffusion</b> <b>currents.</b> We demonstrate that this theoretical approach leads to a violation of the third law of thermodynamics (Nernst's heat theorem) for a wide class of materials and is excluded by the data from two recent experiments. The physical reason for its failure is explained by the violation of thermal equilibrium, which is the fundamental applicability condition of the Lifshitz theory, in the presence of drift and <b>diffusion</b> <b>currents.</b> Comment: 22 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|Single cycle THz {{emission}} from unbiased {{semiconductor devices}} after ultrafast carrier excitation {{can be attributed}} to surge currents {{on the surface of the}} device. These currents are due to either drift currents where carriers are accelerated by an internal electric field perpendicular to the surface (surface field effect) or <b>diffusion</b> <b>currents</b> where a separation of charge forms due to electrons and holes having different mobilities (photo-Dember effect). This surface emission is difficult to out couple from the semiconductor device as the emission is parallel to the surface of the semiconductor. This difficulty in out coupling led to a decline in interest for these types of emitters in preference to photoconductive emitters which today are the standard type of emitters used in THz time domain spectroscopy. In recent years a new type of surface emitter based on lateral <b>diffusion</b> <b>currents</b> (lateral Dember currents) has been proposed and demonstrated. This work acted as the initial inspiration for the work described within this thesis. The emission was attributed to net <b>diffusion</b> <b>currents</b> that formed from an initially asymmetrical carrier distribution that formed due to partially masking the pump spot with a metal mask. Simulations of the situation revealed that diffusion alone cannot account for the observed THz emission from these devices. From this I have extended the mechanism taking into account lateral <b>diffusion</b> <b>currents</b> and dipole suppression under a metal mask. Along with theoretical arguments experimental evidence is given that supports this new theory. These devices are further explored experimentally giving insights into the nature of the emission and how it depends on different pump parameters and external electric fields. Based on this new interpretation I present the design, fabrication, and testing of multiplex emitters that are are comparable with commercial photoconductive emitters in both power and band-width...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the mechanism of}} optical switching and the possible utilisation of the metal tunnel-insulator n-p+ silicon device in optical communication systems. The pertinent design approaches are described. Under optical excitation, photo holes and electrons generated in the surface depletion region, or within diffusion range, will eventually be separated by the electric field and produce an increment in the forward current. Those hole-electron pairs generated in the junction region, or within diffusion range, produce a photovoltaic increase in the p+-n junction bias. Switching is induced optically, as it is electrically, by the build up of holes at the insulator-semiconductor interface. This paper employs the 1 -dimensional diffusion equation to derive the light generated minority Carrier distributions and <b>diffusion</b> <b>currents</b> in the neutral n and p+ regions, together with the currents in the surface and p+-n junction depletion regions. The calculated values of both the drift and <b>diffusion</b> <b>currents</b> compare favourably with those observed experimentally...|$|R

50|$|No {{external}} {{electric field}} across the semiconductor {{is required for}} a <b>diffusion</b> <b>current</b> to take place. This is because diffusion takes place due to the change in concentration of the carrier particles and not the concentrations themselves. The carrier particles, namely the holes and electrons of a semiconductor, move from a place of higher concentration {{to a place of}} lower concentration. Hence, due to the flow of holes and electrons there is a current. This current is called the <b>diffusion</b> <b>current.</b> The drift current and the <b>diffusion</b> <b>current</b> make up the total current in the conductor. The change in the concentration of the carrier particles develops a gradient. Due to this gradient, an electric field is produced in the semiconductor.|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} the contact mechanism from electrical {{properties of the}} ZnS TFTs, ZnS was fabricated on SiOC as a gate insulator on a Si substrate. Ohmic contact without a potential barrier increased the leakage current, but Schottky contact decreased the leakage current because of a Schottky barrier (SB). The ZnS TFTs prepared on SiOC with a Schottky contact improved the stability {{with respect to the}} reduction of drain voltages. The structural matching between ZnS and SiOC increased the height of SB such as ZnS annealed at 200 °C, which made ZnS become an amorphous structure. ZnS/SiOC films with a low SB increased the capacitance and leakage current. The crystallinity orientation of ZnS localized defect states and the drift current owing to the impurity charge carriers caused the leakage current through low SB near zero voltages. But the increment of <b>diffusion</b> <b>currents</b> in a depletion layer increased the SB and then decreased the leakage current. So the electrical properties of devices were improved by a tunneling effect of <b>diffusion</b> <b>currents...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{reports on}} the investigation of two related topics, the (in) -organic electronic ratchet and the organic solar ratchet. These are two implementations of the electronic ratchet device that will first be introduced. The electronic ratchet generates electrical current and voltage by rectifying an external perturbation, {{in the present case}} an oscillating voltage. The oscillation is rectified by a periodic, asymmetric potential in which electronic charges are placed. The external perturbation drives the system away from equilibrium, causing detailed balance to be broken; consequently the periodic asymmetry of the potential leads to a net motion of the charges, comparable to the net motion of marbles on a shaking washboard. Note that under equilibrium conditions no (spontaneous) current will flow in any potential. In this presentation we show that the generated current {{as a function of the}} frequency of the driving signal can be scaled onto a universal profile, covering many orders of magnitude in frequency. Simulations show that this profile is predominantly dependent on drift (as opposed to <b>diffusion)</b> <b>currents</b> in the ratchet. Experimentally this is verified by combining measurements on three different disordered semiconducting materials. IGZO (Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide) as an inorganic amorphous electron semiconductor and Pentacene and P 3 HT/PCBM as organic hole semiconductors. The combined scaled current profile shows a consistent behavior for the three materials over at least seven orders of magnitude of (scaled) frequency. The solar ratchet is a lateral solar cell which can in lowest order be seen as multiple solar cells in series, which is comparable to a multi-junction tandem solar cell. The goal is to create a large open circuit voltage with the intention to create a more efficient solar cell. Simulation of this device turned out to be troublesome due to numerical problems related to the calculation of <b>diffusion</b> <b>currents</b> and of bimolecular recombination. However the first version of the simulation tool, in which drift and <b>diffusion</b> <b>currents</b> are calculated sequentially, shows the possible behavior of the solar ratchet. The second version, in which the drift and <b>diffusion</b> <b>currents</b> are simultaneously calculated using the Boltzmann transport equation, predicts the solar ratchet to be non-functional due to zero recombination. However, the depletion length of the recombination zones can be calculated. On basis of this an analogy can be made with the recombination zone in the pn-junction in a conventional tandem solar cell. As the tandem solar cell is known to work the solar ratchet is predicted to work as well. Experimental proofs of principle of the ratchet solar cell were tried to be made but unfortunately no suitable solar ratchet was produced due to various problems that will be discussed.
