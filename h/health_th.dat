40|$|Globalisation and {{regional}} economic imperatives {{have no doubt}} led to modern work environments increasingly characterised by ‘too much work’, ‘not enough work ’ and ‘no work’ rather than optimal ‘healthy-productive ’ work. Besides negative implications for national economies, {{there is a strong}} belief that mental health problems and stress-related disorders are the biggest overall cause of premature death in Europe (WHO 2001; Levi, 2002). Income inequality arising from such disparate work states seems to have negative health consequences for all members of society as social cohesion that characterises healthy egalitarian societies progressively breaks down (Wilkinson, 1996). This paper explores the various work states, and draws upon a range of work stress and unemployment theories and empirical evidence to describe possible relationships between the meaning of work, work states, their features, and mental health. It also explores the ‘holy grail’: the balance between healthy work and productivity.

40|$|Abstract — Aims: To {{investigate}} the awareness {{and knowledge of}} hazardous drinking limits among the general population in Sweden {{and the extent to}} which people estimate their alcohol consumption in standard drinks to assess their level of drinking. Methods: A population-based study involving 6000 individuals selected from the total Swedish population was performed. Data were collected by means of a postal questionnaire. The mail survey response rate was 54. 3 % (n = 3200) of the net sample of 5891 persons. Results: With regard to drinking patterns, 10 % of the respondents were abstainers, 59 % were sensible drinkers and 31 % were classified as hazardous drinkers. Most of the abstainers (80 %), sensible drinkers (64 %) and hazardous drinkers (56 %) stated that they had never heard about the standard drink method. Familiarity with the hazardous drinking concept also differed between the three categories although ~ 61 % of sensible and hazardous drinkers expressed awareness of the concept (46 % of the abstainers). Knowledge about the limits for sensible drinking was very poor. Between 94 and 97 % in the three categories did not know the limit. There was a statistically significant association between having visited health care within the last 12 months and being aware of the standard drink method and the hazardous drinking concept, but not with knowing the hazardous drinking limits. Similarly, there was a significant association between having had at least one alcohol conversation in health care within the last 12 months and being aware of the standard drink method and the hazardous drinking concept, but not with knowing the hazardous drinking limits. Conclusion: The results can be seen as a major challenge for the health-care system and public health authorities because they imply that a large proportion of the Swedish population does not know when alcohol consumption becomes a threat to their <b>health.</b> <b>Th...</b>|$|E
40|$|For {{many years}} it was {{suspected}} that a specific immune response develops {{in the course of}} infection with Treponema pallidum, but despite attempts by many investigators to demonstrate specific antibodies, only recently have such efforts been successful. Work on this problem led to the discovery of the Wassermann reaction which together with its various modifications that employ lipoid antigens has been found to have a high degree of accuracy in the detection of syphilitic and related infections. However, it is now generally believed that these so called standard serologic tests for syphilis (STS) 1 do not reveal a specific antibody to Treponona pallidum. Moreover, in recent years it has been demonstrated that these tests give positive reactions with sera from a number of individuals who have no history of syphilis or other treponemal disease (1). The development of specific immunity in treponeme infections was first demonstrated by means of neutralization experiments in rabbits (2, 3) by a method which was too time consuming and expensive to be of practical value. Later, the development of the treponemal immobilization test (4) provided for the first time an in ~itro method for the detection of specific treponemal antibodies. However, the technical difficulties of this test have limited its application to a few specially equipped laboratories, and there still remains a great practical need for a simple, specific immunological test {{that can be used in}} the general diagnostic bacteriological laboratory. Numerous unsuccessful attempts have been made to develop a diagnostic test that employs treponemes as the antigen for an agglutination reaction. Hoffman (5) and Zabolotny and Maslakowetz (6) were among the first to demonstrate that T. pallidum expressed from syphilitic lesions were agglutinated by the sera of syphilitic individuals. Their findings were confirmed by others (7 - 11) but most investigations of this problem * These studies were supported jointly by grants from the National Institute of <b>Health,</b> <b>Th...</b>|$|E
40|$|To be poor is by {{definition}} to have less {{of the good things}} in life, including health and longevity. Obtaining equal access to care is a major step in improving health, however, improved access to health services {{is only part of the}} solution for advancing health, avoiding illnesses and enhancing well-being. Th e fact remains that people at the bottom of society are faced with the worst living conditions and report the worst health outcomes. Regardless the country these poor people live in, what type of health insurance they have or do not have, and the level of health care they receive, they still have the worst health of all. These disparities cannot be explained by biological differences. The World Health Organization holistically viewed the social determinants of health, concluding that global health and illness follow a social gradient; lower socioeconomic positions are consistently correlated with poorer <b>health.</b> <b>Th</b> ese avoidable health inequalities arise because of the circumstances in which people are born, live, work, and age, including the adequacy of health care systems. Th e conditions in which people live and die are, in turn, shaped by social and economic forces. Together, the structural determinants and conditions of daily life constitute the socioeconomic determinants of health. These are responsible for a major part of health inequities between and within countries, and constitute one form of social injustice. Global action focused on the socioeconomic determinants of health is necessary to achieve health equity. Since neighbourhoods and communities are amendable to intervention, they are the most appropriate social levels at which to improve the health of populations. Most human development programs seek as a primary goal to improve the subjective well-being of those most aff ected by poverty. In 2000, 189 countries signed the United Nations Millennium Declaration, which set eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to be achieved by 2015. Th ese MDGs aim to decrease poverty, inequality and improve health and subjective well-being; the latter is increasingly recognized as an important additional source for the evaluation of broad societal and economic development. Communities and neighbourhoods with high levels of subjective well-being are essential for health equity. An accumulating body of knowledge has shown that subjective well-being is a strong predictor of physical health and longevity, spurring growing interest in this factor...|$|E
