Gavrilović during the mid-twentieth century last, by various intensity, until the present time. A many decades work on the research of these issues pointed to some shortcomings of the existing methodology, and thus the need for its innovation. In this sense, R. Lazarević made certain adjustments of the empirical methodology of S. Gavrilović by changing the tables for determination of the coefficients Φ, X and Y, that is, the tables for determining the mean <b>erosion</b> <b>coefficient</b> (Z). The main objective {{of this paper is}} to update the existing methodology for determining the <b>erosion</b> <b>coefficient</b> (Z) with the empirical methodology of S. Gavrilović and amendments made by R. Lazarević (1985), but also with better adjustments to the information technologies and the needs of modern society.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the meandering phenomenon as {{it occurs in}} media throughout terrestrial, glacial, atmospheric, and aquatic environments. Analysis of the minimum energy principle, along with theories of Coriolis forces (and random walks to explain the meandering phenomenon) found that these theories apply at different temporal and spatial scales. Coriolis forces might induce topological changes resulting in meandering planforms. The minimum energy principle might explain how these forces combine to limit the sinuosity to depth and width ratios that are common throughout various media. The study then compares the first order analytical solutions for flow field by Ikeda, et al. (1981) and Johannesson and Parker (1989 b). Ikeda's et al. linear bank erosion model was implemented to predict the rate of bank erosion in which the bank <b>erosion</b> <b>coefficient</b> is treated as a stochastic variable that varies with physical properties of the bank (e. g., cohesiveness, stratigraphy, or vegetation density). The developed model was used to predict the evolution of meandering planforms. Then, the modeling results were analyzed and compared to the observed data. Since the migration of a meandering channel consists of downstream translation, lateral expansion, and downstream or upstream rotations several measures are formulated {{in order to determine}} which of the resulting planforms is closest to the experimental measured one. Results from the deterministic model highly depend on the calibrated <b>erosion</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Since field measurements are always limited, the stochastic model yielded more realistic predictions of meandering planform evolutions.

Furthermore, investigations were performed on the validity of quasisteady approximation based on shortterm events, revealing various useful characteristics. A study was also conducted on the capability of mixed-quasisteady-unsteady simulation in comparison to the validated fully-unsteady simulation, by setting criteria for the assumption of long quasisteady steps. The result indicated that quasisteady simulation can well be implemented with large time step △T, for flows lower than the critical erosion discharge (around 200 m 3 /s) without major discrepancy in the sense of long-term simulation. The relative amount of cumulative sediment deposition of the overestimated and underestimated steps converged gradually in the long-term simulation. The peak flows were separately treated as the averaging dampened the erosive effect of flows. Fully-unsteady simulation or quasisteady step of short time step △T can be implemented at peaks, of which, the fully-unsteady simulation were used in this study. The study also compared bed evolution prediction for 2025 using fully-unsteady and mixed-quasisteady-unsteady simulation, resulting in a good agreement.

Indeed different soils can erode at different rates. However, the relationship between the erosion parameters and the geotechnical and chemical properties of soils remains largely unknown. The jet erosion test appears to be an efficient and simple means for quantifying the two erosion parameters involved. The first parameter is the critical stress while the second parameter is the <b>erosion</b> <b>coefficient.</b> A simplified model of this test has been drawn up by G.

The aim {{of this study is to}} simulate the impinging jet and to take into account the erosion of the soil by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical modelling. The key point was the time dependence of the problem, due to erosion processes, however the turbulent flow could be considered as steady because of the assumption of low kinetics erosion assumption. The results of the present modelling study are compared to the simplified model and to experimental data.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Coal {{power is}} the {{prominent}} source {{of energy in the}} United States (U. S.) and around the world. The byproducts of coal power contain many of the same radioactive nuclides that are found in the local environment just in higher concentrations. With so much of this ash being stockpiled, the amount of radioactive material in one location can be staggering. 	Currently, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations covering disposal of coal ash are focused on protection of the environment and the general public from the risks associated with heavy metals like mercury and arsenic, but not specifically for radionuclides. However, in the case of decommissioning of nuclear power facilities, both the EPA and U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulations for environmental protection are quite stringent. Comparisons of the risk basis for the regulatory oversight of residual radiation from the two different sources of power are needed to bring the radiation levels into context. 	 Utilizing the software package RESRAD simulations of the annual radiation dose were made to hypothetical members of the general public residing in an area contaminated by the coal ash residue from two coal-fired power facilities. The first is the Kingston facility operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the second is Portland General Electric's (PGE, Boardman coal-fired plant. The methodology used in this assessment is the state of practice followed by the nuclear power industry as it decommissions its facilities.

The coal ash quantities, quality, and type were obtained from data TVA and applied to the PGE site. 	Results from the simulation suggested elevated radiation levels to occupants residing on either site.

40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed September 14, 2010) Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 24 - 25) Sediment runoff from areas of disturbed soil, such as those common on construction sites, {{is an issue of}} great concern both from an environmental impact standpoint and as a regulatory compliance issue for construction site mangers. In order to address these concerns and to help develop appropriate mitigating strategies, it is first necessary to be able to quantify the expected sediment runoff for a given site. To this end, this study will build on work performed by the Soil Erosion Research Laboratory (SERL) of San Diego State University in order to assess the effectiveness of using a physically based model of sediment transport to accurately predict sediment discharge due to erosion. While there are empirical models such as the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) that are widely used, such approaches remain limited in that they draw strictly from observed phenomenon. While extensive research has been conducted, the charts and tables associated with RUSLE are not all inclusive and cannot, as the name would imply, be ???universally??? applied. By using a physically based model it is hoped {{that as long as the}} physical characteristics of given soil/site are known, a single model would be sufficient to make accurate predictions of sediment runoff. Using the KINEROS 2 software developed by the U. S. Department of Agriculture, it has been possible to run numerous iterations of a simulated rain event on a small watershed based on the kinematic wave theory of sediment transport. Simulations were conducted on an 8 meter by 2 meter (L x W) plane at three separate grades and were intended to mimic the conditions of experiments performed by SERL.

Critical shear stress and erosion rates are predominant variables in transport mechanics. This study presents {{a comparison between}} in situ and laboratory measurements of sediment erodibility. The main goal was to assess the reliability of critical shear stress of erosion determined in a laboratory flume. The laboratory experiment allowed us to define the erodibility of sediments sampled at a reference station in the Gulf of Fos. This site is frequently influenced by Rhône river inflows. Two different values of critical shear stress of erosion were determined, the lowest (τc 1 = 0. 02 ± 0. 002 N m− 2) related to the erosion of the fluff layer, and the highest (τc 2 = 0. 05 ± 0. 005 N m− 2) to a more consolidated layer or to coarser particles. These values of critical shear stress were very close to commonly in situ based estimates of fluff critical shear stresses, which ranged between 0. 02 and 0. 05 N m− 2. The comparison with acoustic backscatter data recorded during a field cruise in autumn attested in a qualitative way to the reliability of the critical shear stress of erosion determined in our laboratory flume. The <b>erosion</b> <b>coefficients</b> determined during this study, varying between 3. 4 10 − 6 and 7. 5 10 − 6 kg m− 2 s− 1, were used to calculate in situ erosion rates. Between 6 and 9 October, the mean erosion rate at the reference station was 20 g m− 2 h− 1 and maximum values reached 65 g m− 2 h− 1. The calculated erosion rates were used to predict in situ variations in suspended sediment concentration (SPM).

40|$|In {{this study}} the river {{migration}} model MIANDRAS {{has been applied}} to simulations of the planform changes of the river Allier, a tributary of the river Loire in France. The Allier is a very dynamic and natural river system with braided and meandering river sections. Two meandering reaches of the Allier, located between Varennes-sur-Allier and Moulins, have been examined in the present study. MIANDRAS is a numerical model that simulates meandering processes in shallow alluvial rivers with erodible banks. In MIANDRAS the river is schematised as a single meandering channel, as the floodplains are assumed non-conveying. For the prediction of river planform changes, the rate and direction of bank erosion are computed by coupling a steady-state flow and bed topography model with a time-dependent bank erosion model. Sediment gradation, timedependent variations of the bed topography (i. e. migrating bars) and flow exchanges between the main channel and the floodplains are not taken into account. MIANDRAS did not perform satisfactorily in predicting the planform changes of the Allier. The 2 (and 3 -) dimensional flow processes in flood periods, caused by floodplain constrictions and flow exchange between the main channel and the floodplains, appeared to be an important feature influencing the bank erosion. Therefore, the influence of overbank flow was studied in more detail. The 3 -dimensional flow model DELFT 3 D-FLOW (TRISULA) was used to simulate overbank flow processes in one of the examined reaches of the Allier. The results of the MIANDRAS computations can be explained reasonably well from the results of the overbank flow computations. Near the upstream floodplain constriction, where high bank erosion rates were observed in the prototype river, high velocities occurred in the overbank flow computations. At this location high bank <b>erosion</b> <b>coefficients</b> had to be adopted in the MIANDRAS computations. The relatively low erosion rates at the downstream boundary {{can be explained by the}} low velocities occurring in overbank flow. These are due to backwater effects near the downstream floodplain constriction. The small erosion rates at this location resulted in small erodibilities in the MIANDRAS computations. Floodplain bed roughness appears to have a significant influence on velocity directions and magnitudes. The velocity field is correlated to the flow exchange between the main channel and the floodplains. This flow exchange strongly decreases in the case of a higher floodplain bed roughness. These results agree with the results of scale model experiments performed in the Flood Channel Facility at HR Wallingford, England. The results of this study give new indications for the range of applicability of MIANDRAS. Besides the possibility to use MIANDRAS in case of rivers with mainly inbank flow, the model can also be applied to rivers with overbank flow periods, provided that the flow exchange between the main channel and the floodplains is small. A small flow exchange occurs in case of a high floodplain bed roughness, a straight floodplain and main channel, or relatively small flood discharges.

The solid phase {{consists of a}} granular assembly where dynamics of each solid particle is described with the discrete element method. In the inter-particle space the fluid flow is solved with the lattice Boltzmann method. Interactions between the solid phase and the fluid phase result from the integration, over the solid particle boundary, of the momentum exchange between solid and fluid phases. Consequently, assumptions about fluid-solid interactions are very limited with such a coupling. To illustrate abilities and limits of the coupled method {{in the framework of}} internal soil erosion, a two-dimensional model of piping erosion is considered (inspired from the hole erosion test). Direct simulations of erosion of a cohesive- frictional granular matter have been performed for different values of water pressure gradient and inter-particle cohesion. As classically found experimentally, the mass rate of erosion follows a relation of the kind of Shield's law, with a linear dependency on the hydraulic shear stress. A critical hydraulic shear stress, below which detachment of particles does not occur, can be identified and {{is directly related to the}} inter-particle cohesion.

40|$|Abstract: Risk and {{reliability}} analysis is presently being performed {{in almost all}} fields of engineering depending upon the specific field and its particular area. Probabilistic risk analysis (PRA), also called quantitative risk analysis (QRA) is a central feature of hydraulic engineering structural design. Actually, probabilistic methods, which consider resistance and load parameters as random variables, are more suitable than conventional deterministic methods to determine the safety level of a hydraulic structure. In fact, hydraulic variables involved in plunge pools, such as discharge, flow depth, and velocity, are stochastic in nature, which may be represented by relevant probability distributions. Therefore, the optimal design of a plunge pool needs to be modelled by probabilistic methods. The main topic {{of this paper is}} concerned with the reliability-based assessment of the geometry of the plunge pool downstream of a ski jump bucket. Experimental data obtained from a model of a flip bucket spillway has been used to develop a number of equations for the prediction of scour geometry downstream from a flip bucket spillway of a large dam structure. The accuracy of the developed equations was examined both through statistical and experimental procedures with satisfactory results. In addition, reliability computations have been carried out using the Monte Carlo technique. The main conclusions are that structural reliability analysis {{can be used as a}} tool in the dam safety risk management process and that the most important factors for further analysis are <b>erosion,</b> friction <b>coefficient,</b> uplift and self-weight...|$|R

These properties, namely the critical shear stress for erosion and the <b>erosion</b> rate <b>coefficient,</b> are crucial for reproducing the short-term and long-term sediment dynamics of the system. Methods to parameterize these properties involve either specialized laboratory measurements on sediment samples or optimization by model calibration. Based on observations of regular patterns in the variation of suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) over the tidal cycle in a small, narrow estuary, an alternate approach, {{referred to as the}} entrainment flux method, for quantifying the erosion properties of surficial bed strata is formulated and applied. The results of this method are shown to be analogous to the erosion data used to formulate the standard linear erosion formulation developed by various authors. The erosion properties inferred from the entrainment flux method are also compared to direct measurements of erodibility on sediment samples from the same site using the Gust microcosm apparatus. The favorable comparison of the two approaches suggests that the entrainment flux method can be used to infer and quantify the erodibility of surficial sediment strata in similar small and narrow estuaries.

40|$|International audienceEarthen dams can be {{overtopped}} during extreme {{events that}} reach flow discharges above the design discharge. Breaching models can simulate {{the erosion of}} the embankment and can be coupled with 1 -D or 2 -D shallow water equations for propagating the dam break wave. Alternatively, sediment transport models can be used for both processes. In order to evaluate the influence of the choice of the model and of the main parameters of each model, two series of tests are used. The first ones concern one field test including a 6 m high embankment; the second ones deal with laboratory experiments in which the embankment height is about 0. 6 m. Comparing the flow hydrograph at breach site, the higher differences come from the calculation method of the erosion rate or more simply from the value of the <b>erosion</b> <b>coefficient.</b> However, for the selected experiments, these differences are essentially outside the period with high velocities which means that the peak discharges are very similar and that the main differences are found {{in the evolution of the}} breach shape leading, for instance, to very different final breach width...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study {{focuses on}} the {{numerical}} modelling of concentrated leak erosion of a cohesive soil by a turbulent flow in axisymmetrical geometry, with application to the Hole Erosion Test (HET). The numerical model is based on adaptive remeshing of the water/soil interface to ensure accurate description of the mechanical phenomena occurring near the soil/water interface. The erosion law governing the interface motion is based on two erosion parameters: the critical shear stress and the <b>erosion</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The model is first validated {{in the case of}} 2 D piping erosion induced by a laminar flow. Then, the numerical results are compared with the interpretation model of the Hole Erosion Test. Three HETs performed on different soils are modelled with a rather good accuracy. Lastly, a parametric analysis of the influence of the erosion parameters on erosion kinetics and evolution of channel diameter is conducted. Finally, after this validation by comparison with both the experimental results and the interpretation of Bonelli et al. [2], our model is now able to reproduce accurately the erosion of a cohesive soil by a concentrated leak. It also gives access to a detailed description of all the averaged hydrodynamic flow quantities. This detailed description is essential in order to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} erosion processes...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Internal {{soil erosion}} {{is a real}} threat for {{hydraulic}} infrastructures. In&# 13; its final stage it develops in piping involving the formation and progression of a continuous void&# 13; inside the soil between the upstream and downstream sides. The hole erosion test was introduced to&# 13; characterize kinematics of piping {{in terms of the}} time left to rupture. Actual modeling approaches of&# 13; this test are essentially one dimensional. The wall shear stress generated by the flow is assumed to be&# 13; uniform, so that erosion rate is also uniform along the hole length. Experimental observations show&# 13; however an irregular profile of the eroded hole. Approach: In this study an axisymmetric extension&# 13; representation of the hole erosion test was performed. The biphasic flow at the origin of surface&# 13; erosion occurring in the porous soil sample was modeled by means of the renormalization group&# 13; based k-&# 949; turbulence equations. Fluent software package was used to perform the numerical&# 13; modeling. Results: This had enabled to estimate the wall shear stress which was found to be non&# 13; uniform along the hole length. Erosion rate was then estimated by using a classical law. Its variations&# 13; as affected by the applied gradient pressure, fluid density as well as the actual fluid/soil interface&# 13; roughness were analyzed. In particular, wall roughness and clay concentration were found to&# 13; increase noticeably the erosion rate. Conclusion/Recommendations: Predicting erosion rate at the&# 13; start of piping formation can be done by the proposed model. Flow features are however very&# 13; complex in the real HET configuration. In particular, clay concentration does not vary equally along&# 13; the hole length. The <b>erosion</b> law <b>coefficients</b> are variable. Transport phenomenon of some soils&# 13; particles that detach is present in the problem. Further investigations including these aspects should&# 13; be performed in order to render more profoundly the complex physics involved in this experiment...|$|R
40|$|A {{short-term}} {{swash zone}} beach profile change model focusing on berm formation and erosion proposed by Suzuki and Kuriyama (2010) was improved. The model was developed using a 2. 5 -year data set of beach profiles and offshore waves observed at the Hasaki coast, Ibaraki, Japan, facing the Pacific Ocean. The distributions of cross-shore {{sediment transport rate}} for berm formation and erosion were determined using the curve slopes at the inflection points. The curve slopes for berm formation and erosion were estimated by using the wave energy flux, and {{the product of the}} wave height of long-period wave and berm height, respectively. The investigation area was set from the maximum wave run-up position to the shoreline position at the mean tide level. The both models were applied to the calculation of the beach profile change for three months, which results were compared with observed data. It is found that the present model well predicts not only the shoreline change, but also the beach profile change, including the berm formation and <b>erosion.</b> The correlation <b>coefficient</b> (R) of shoreline position at the high tide level between the numerical results and observed data is 0. 70, which is 0. 37 higher than the previous model.

40|$|Problems {{associated}} with erodible soils {{have been reported}} in Australia and {{many parts of the world}} since the early 1970 s. Significant soil loss from embankments, internal erosion and piping are some of the problems that practicing engineers face during the construction and maintenance phase of earth structures constructed with erodible soils. It is therefore necessary to identify appropriate stabilisation techniques to control erosion. This study considers chemical stabilisation as an erosion control method and a rigorous testing program has been conducted to investigate how effectively two chemical agents (general purpose Portland cement and lignosulfonate) control the erosion rate of two natural erodible soils (a silty sand and dispersive clay). In this study, a Process Simulation Apparatus for Internal Crack Erosion (PSAICE) has been designed and built to conduct tests on chemically treated and untreated soil samples. The effect of the degree of compaction and moulding water content on erosional behaviour of soils has also been addressed. In addition, the tensile stress-deformation characteristics of chemically treated soil samples have been investigated using a uniaxial tensile testing apparatus, designed and built at University of Wollongong for this current research study. One of the main objectives was to develop an analytical model for the erosion rate that incorporates the tensile stress-deformation characteristics of the soil. The model has been developed based on the law of the conservation of energy and validated using the results of erosion and uniaxial tensile tests conducted on chemically stabilised soil samples. The results of the tests indicated that the erosion rate changes linearly with the hydraulic shear stress; slope of the line that represents the <b>coefficient</b> of soil <b>erosion.</b> The <b>coefficient</b> of soil <b>erosion</b> decreases, while the critical shear stress increases with an increasing amount of stabiliser, irrespective of the soil type. It was also found that the <b>coefficient</b> of soil <b>erosion</b> of chemically treated soil has a strong relationship with its critical shear stress. Uniaxial tensile tests on chemically treated saturated samples showed that both stabilisers increase the tensile strength with a decrease in the displacement at failure. Model validation demonstrated that only a fraction of flow energy (i. e. efficiency index) is used for the erosion process, and it depends on the hydraulic conditions of flow. Moreover, the proposed model can be used to predict the erosion rate of chemically treated erodible soils, if the tensile stress-deformation characteristics, mean particle diameter, dry density, and mean flow velocity through the crack are known...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Jet Erosion Test (JET) is an {{experimental}} device increasingly used {{to quantify the}} resistance of soils to erosion. This resistance is characterised by two geotechnical parameters: the critical shear stress and the <b>erosion</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The JET interpretation model of Hanson and Cook (2004) provides an estimation of these erosion parameters. But Hanson's model is simplified, semi-empirical and several assumed hypotheses can be discussed. Our aim {{is to determine the}} relevance of the JET interpretation model. Therefore, we developed a numerical model able to predict the erosion of a cohesive soil by a turbulent flow. Our numerical model is first validated on a benchmark: erosion of an erodible pipe by a laminar flow. The numerical results are satisfactorily compared with the theoretical solution. Then, three JETs are modelled numerically, with values of erosion parameters obtained experimentally. A parametric study is also conducted to validate the accuracy of the numerical results and a good agreement is observed. The erosion parameters found experimentally permit to predict numerically the evolution of the erosion pattern within good accuracy. This result contributes to the validation of the JET's semi-empirical model. The numerical model also gives a complete description of the flow, including vortices which can be observed in the cavity created by erosion. The whole erosion pattern evolution is given by the numerical results. Our numerical model gives information that is not available otherwise...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of erosion of a riverbank {{is not easy}} to analyze and each sediment particle is under influence of number of forces. Among all these forces, force of cohesion between the particles plays a very dominant and significant role, and, till date, not much progress has been made to analyze this force in a deterministic manner. A particle is bound to its neighboring particles under this force of cohesion. In this paper, the analysis of forces acting on a particle on a riverbank has been made with a model called the Truncated Pyramid Model. A particle requires a certain velocity to escape from the riverbank and determination of the escape velocity can pave the way for finding out other parameters like entrainment rate, <b>erosion</b> <b>coefficient</b> and so on. Calculation and estimation of riverbank erosion rate is an important aspect of river basin management. In this paper {{it has been shown that}} the escape velocity is dependent on certain micro-level parameters like inter-particle distance and volume of the water bridge between two adjacent particles. Also, for saline water the particle requires less velocity to escape compared to the pure-water scenario. The findings of the present paper exactly fall in line with the results of another paper where the researchers showed that cohesive force between the particles decreases as water turns from pure to impure...|$|E
40|$|Wind erosion in Lithuania, as {{also the}} {{neighbouring}} Baltic countries, occurs mainly {{in areas where}} the natural plant cover has been replaced by agriculture. In the years of Soviet power, the formation of vast continuous tilled fields (up to 1000 ha) and extinction of agroplantations and individual farmsteads, contributed greatly to intensification of wind erosion. As a result of soil drainage and wind erosion (the wind no longer meets obstacles on its way) in some years up to several tons of light soils would be blown out in a few days (e. g., 1982, 1988, 1989). A group of scientists from the Institute of Geography in Vilnius (R. Morkunaite, S. Paskauskas, M. Beconis, V. Minkevicius, headed by the author of the present article) investigated the processes of wind erosion in 1986 - 1991. The field investigations were carried out using various sediment samplers [2, 3]. These investigations were supplemented by a physical modeling of wind erosion processes in the wind tunnel [1]. From the data obtained a mathematical model was worked out, which expresses the dependence of wind erosion on the major determining factors: D = - 1798 ± 450 v- 357 g- 105 h- 45 m where wind <b>erosion</b> <b>coefficient</b> (R) = 0. 69, D is the volume of blown soil, t/ha/h; v = wind speed, m/s; g = diameter of equivalent soil aggregates, mm; h = humus, %; m = content of physical clay...|$|E

Four models were used for providing working units` maps by integration of data layers including A. plant cover, geology and slope B. land use, geology and slope C. land use, rocks erodibility and slope and D. land use, rocks erodibility and land units. The surface, rill and gully erosion intensity in the 314 spot were controlled to provide ground truth map from each of these erosion features. Soil erosion type`s map obtained from the integration of these truth maps and then this map was crossed by the maps A to D. Results indicated that the integration of land use, rocks erodibility and land units layers is a better model for providing erosion types map than other models from an economic and executive regards. The cross of the map D with the ground truth maps of surface, rill and gully erosions showed the greatest and least accuracy are related to providing gully erosion and erosion features maps, respectively. The greatest precision of model was related to providing gully <b>erosion</b> map (with <b>coefficient</b> of variation 17. 8 %) and the least precision (with 40. 5 % coefficient of variations) was related to providing erosion features map.

40|$|Results from on-farm {{measurements}} of surface overland flow of both runon (Ron) and runoff (Roff) are presented for a continuously cutivated pearl millet (#Pennisetum glaucum$ (L.) R. Br.) field, along a characteristic catena, in the Sahel (Niger). Despite the deep sandy soil along the studied hillslope, {{classified as a}} Typic Haplustult, non-negligible depths of Roff was measured during two rainy seasons : 12 - 13 % of total rainfall for the upslope position and 6 - 8 % for the downslope position. This was explained {{by the presence of}} surface crusts with low infiltrability. Upslope, more than 30 % of the soil surface was covered with <b>erosion</b> crusts (runoff <b>coefficient</b> (Kr) = 60 - 70 % for moist soil conditions) during 40 % of the rainy season. The mean coverage of erosion crusts for two rainy seasons was 26 % upslope, compared with 11 % and 15 % midslope and downslope, respectively. Weeding, carried out manually with hand hoes, had a very positive effect on soil infiltrability. The destruction of surface crusts resulted in zero Roff (Kr = 0) for rainstorms directly following weeding operations. However, surface crusts were quickly re-established {{as a result of the}} erosive effect of the following storms. Large volumes of runon (Ron) water were measured at the upslope limit of the field (14. 4 m 3 /m in 1995, corresponding to a rainfall depth of 47. 5 mm if redistributed over the 8. 5 ha millet field). Small volumes were registered downslope (Ron = 0. 75 m 3 /m), indicating redistribution of Ron along the hillslope. The Ron originated from the upstream degraded fallow zone and the adjacent sparsely vegetated plateau, which in effect functioned as water-harvesting zones. Roff was modelled based on field observations of surface coverage of soil crusts, data on hydraulic characteristics for the observed crusts, rainfall data and estimates of antecedent soil moisture [...] .

40|$|Executive SummaryThis report {{presents}} a catchment sediment and nutrient {{budget for the}} Northern Territory’s Daly River catchment. A catchment sediment or nutrient budget accounts for the major sources, transport pathways and sinks of sediments and nutrients within a catchment. A catchment sediment or nutrient budget {{is not something that}} can be directly measured, consequently a modelling framework is required to bring the individual components of the budget (which themselves are sub-models) together in a coherent manner. The SedNet and ANNEX models have been used in this case; these models have been widely applied in tropical Queensland settings and elsewhere in Australia. Each sediment budget term comprises its own sub-model and here, a combination of national-scale models (e. g. terrain hillslope erosion, surface soil nutrient concentrations), and locally-derived models (bank erosion, floodplain extent) have been used for input data. For some aspects of the model, such as sub-soil sediment generation from “gully erosion” processes, no catchment-wide local data was available and values have been inferred from comparisons between model predictions and observational data. The model predicts budgets for fine sediment readily transported in suspension, and dissolved and particulate nutrients. The model has been calibrated to (a) station-based load estimates at three locations, (b) geochemical tracer data indicating relative tributary contributions at river confluences, and (c) fallout radionuclide tracer data indicating the proportion of surface soil in-transit at a variety of locations. Calibration to these observational data sets are critical to obtaining realistic model results. The calibration process involved capping predicted hillslope erosion rates, reducing the hillslope sediment delivery ratio, modifying the bank erosion and overbank sediment settling velocity terms, applying a spatially uniform rate of sub-soil sediment generation from gully erosion and modifying sub-soil nitrogen concentrations. The model was consequently able to predict erosion intensity moderately well for two of the three load estimate stations, was able to correctly predict the dominant tributary contributions, and predicted surface-soil to be a minor component of the transported load, consistent with the tracer data. Predicted floodplain deposition rates were consistent with eight floodplain aggradation rate measurements from the catchment. The calibrated model predicts 503 kt per year of fine sediment export from the catchment. Bank erosion is predicted to be the main sediment input term, exceeding the combined estimates of hillslope and gully erosion. Bank erosion also contributes strongly to the sediment load exported from the catchment. Sediment deposition upon floodplains accounts for approximately 81 % of the catchment sediment supply. Areas strongly contributing to sediment export from the catchment are predominantly located in the north-west of the catchment (including the Douglas River) and along the stems of the major channels. The upper Dry River and Katherine Rivers are predicted to contribute relatively modestly to the catchment export. Sensitivity modelling of load variations to spatially uniform variations in sediment supply indicated a percentage change in hillslope and gully erosion applied across the catchment yielded ∼ 0. 16 percentage variation in sediment load at the catchment outlet, whereas for bank <b>erosion,</b> this <b>coefficient</b> was ∼ 0. 65. This reflects the high rate of sediment input from bank erosion and the strong contribution of this input to the catchment export. The high rate of bank erosion is likely a product of a shift to wetter conditions since 1996, with runoff estimated to be 66 % higher than the mean for previous decades, resulting in systematic channel widening along at least the main stem of the Daly River, however this remains to be confirmed by more detailed field investigations. The modelled nutrient budgets indicated 855 – 1369 and 178 t/yr of nitrogen and phosphorus export respectively. In the case of phosphorus this is approximately evenly split between dissolved and particulate phosphorus, though nitrogen may comprise a particulate-dominated load, depending on model parameterisation. The spatial pattern of nutrient contribution to catchment export is again dominated by input from the north-west of the catchment...|$|R
