5|$|Caligari had its Los Angeles premiere at Miller's Theater on 7 May 1921, but {{the theatre}} {{was forced to}} pull it due to demonstrations by protestors. However, the protest was {{organized}} by the Hollywood branch of the American Legion due to fears of unemployment stemming from the import of German films into America, not over objections {{to the content of}} Caligari itself. After running in large commercial theatres, Caligari began to be shown <b>in</b> <b>smaller</b> theatres and film societies in major cities. Box office figures were not regularly published in the 1920s, so it has been difficult to assess the commercial success or failure of Caligari in the United States. Film historians Kristin Thompson and David B. Pratt separately studied trade publications from the time in an attempt to make a determination, but reached conflicting findings; with Thompson concluding it was a box office success and Pratt concluding it was a failure. However, both agreed it was more commercially successful in major cities than in theatres <b>in</b> <b>smaller</b> communities, where tastes were considered more conservative.|$|E

40|$|Background and aim: One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in learning is ignoring the teaching <b>in</b> <b>small</b> group discussion. So, today, teaching in student-based methods such as work <b>in</b> <b>small</b> group is emphasized. Nevertheless, this method is not used for teaching physiotherapy students. This study was performed {{to determine the effect}} of teaching <b>in</b> <b>small</b> group on satisfaction and learning level of second- year students in physiotherapy in comparison with lecture teaching. Materials and methods: An experimental study was performed on 29 physiotherapy students. The students were randomly classified into two groups; lecture (14 people) and work <b>in</b> <b>small</b> group (15 people). Students were educated for 4 sessions. Two separate questionnaires were used to assess learning and satisfaction levels. Results: Overall satisfaction <b>in</b> <b>small</b> group was significantly greater than lecture group (P 0. 05). 86. 7 % of students <b>in</b> <b>small</b> groups preferred to be educated in the future semesters using this teaching method. Conclusion: This study showed the role of small group teaching on increasing students' satisfaction level. Due to increased satisfaction <b>in</b> <b>small</b> group, despite the lack of significant difference between the two methods of learning, learning process can be facilitated. Thus this method is recommended for education of the undergraduate students...|$|R

Also, C.disseminatus has smaller spores than C.impatiens, typically 6.6–9.7 by 4.1–5.8μm. C.eurysporus is similar to C.disseminatus but usually grows in groups on fallen branches, and has broader spores that measure 8.3–10.3 by 6.7–8.4µm. C.hiascens usually grows in small dense clumps, has narrower spores (typically 9–11 by 4.5–5.5μm, and produces smaller fruit bodies.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} moderating role of attempted dietary restraint {{on the amount}} of food consumed from <b>small</b> food <b>in</b> <b>small</b> packages versus large food in large packages.

For restrained eaters, overconsumption of the <b>small</b> food <b>in</b> <b>small</b> packages results from a lapse in self-control caused by the stress of perceiving conflicting food information: the <b>small</b> food <b>in</b> <b>small</b> packages is perceived as both diet food and high in calories.

30|$|Results {{reveal that}} in general, the {{association}} between minimum wages and firms’ actual wages, for both production workers and non-production workers, is robust and significant. For production workers, a 10 percent increase in real minimum wages {{is associated with a}} 1.8 percent increase <b>in</b> wages <b>in</b> <b>small</b> firms, but only 0.8 percent increase in wages in large firms. For non-production workers, a 10 percent increase in real minimum wages is associated with a 1.65 percent increase <b>in</b> wages <b>in</b> <b>small</b> firms, but only 1.2 percent in larger firms. The association between minimum wages and actual wages is significant, of large magnitude <b>in</b> <b>small</b> firms, but less so in larger firms. This suggests that wages <b>in</b> <b>small</b> firms are more sensitive to changes in minimum wages, which is consistent with the fact that on average, wages <b>in</b> <b>small</b> firms are significantly lower. <b>In</b> other words, <b>small</b> firms are more likely to raise their wages in response to an increase in minimum wages because their wages are more binding.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} role of {{syndicated}} loan markets in financial market development in 24 European countries.

Syn-dicated loans play a different role <b>in</b> large versus <b>small</b> financial systems. <b>In</b> <b>small</b> markets, loan syndications are a substitute for missing public debt markets, while in large financial markets loan syndicates enable arrangers to spread risk more efficiently. Foreign banks tend to reinforce this effect. <b>In</b> <b>small</b> markets, they transfer external finance across borders and in large markets they tend to take on more risky projects. Consequently, we find that characteristics of loan contracts arranged by foreign banks <b>in</b> <b>small</b> versus large markets differ considerably...|$|R
