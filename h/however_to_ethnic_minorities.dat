40|$|Despite {{anti-discrimination}} {{legislation and}} the potential for hefty fines, labor market discrimination remains an issue for <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> and women, particularly in the recruitment and screening process. The apparent failure of legal and voluntary interventions has created a call for anonymous application procedures (AAP), in which key identifying data is hidden from recruiters in the initial recruiting process. Using unusually rich Swedish data on actual applications and recruitments, the authors show that AAP increased the chances of both women and individuals of non-Western origin of advancing to the interview stage. In addition, results show that women experienced an increased probability of being offered a job under AAP. <b>However,</b> applicants belonging <b>to</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> were equally disadvantaged in terms of job offers under conventional and anonymous hiring procedures, suggesting that racial and ethnic discrimination may be harder to circumvent than gender discrimination...|$|R

40|$|The {{recruitment}} of respondents belonging <b>to</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> poses important challenges {{in social and}} health research. This paper reflects on the enablers and barriers to recruitment that we encountered in our research work with persons belonging <b>to</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities.</b> Additionally, we applied the Matching Model of Recruitment, a theoretical framework concerning minority recruitment, to guide our reflection. We also explored its applicability as a research design tool. In assessing our research experience, we learned that minority recruitment in social and health research {{is influenced by the}} social context of all key players involved in the research. Also, there are enablers and barriers within that social context facilitating or delaying the recruitment process. The main enablers to recruit respondents belonging <b>to</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> include working with community agencies and gatekeepers who share a common vision with researchers and the latter's ability to gain the trust of potential respondents. The main barriers include demanding too much from these same community agencies and gatekeepers and ignoring factors that could delay the completion of the research. Although we found the Matching Model of Recruitment to be an effective tool in assessing the processes of recruiting respondents belonging <b>to</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities,</b> further empirical research is needed to explore its usefulness during the research planning phase...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} different institutions on ethnic minorities’ political participation. Based {{on the results of}} a hierarchical cross-country comparison, we found that individuals belonging <b>to</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> were less likely to participate in national elections than members of the majority groups within the same country. We tested whether this negative effect of belonging <b>to</b> an <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> group on political participation could be attenuated by inclusive institutions such as suffrage rights, horizontal power-sharing institutions (Proportional electoral system PR, effective proportionality, the number of government parties) or vertical power-dividing institutions in terms of federalism (subnational elections and subnational authority) attenuated the negative effect of belonging <b>to</b> an <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> group. The results of multilevel analyses showed that suffrage rights attenuate the negative effect of minority status on political participation. In contrast, power dividing enhances the negative effect of belonging <b>to</b> an <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> group on political participation...|$|R
