5|$|The Battle of the Olive <b>Grove</b> <b>of</b> Kountouras {{took place}} in the summer of 1205, in Messenia in the Peloponnese peninsula, between the Frankish Crusaders and the local Greeks, {{resulting}} in a victory of the Frankish knights and the collapse of the local resistance.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the Greeks of Laconia and Arcadia, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of a certain Michael, tried to stop the Franks at the olive <b>grove</b> <b>of</b> Kountouras in northeastern Messenia. Modern scholars have traditionally identified this Michael with Michael I Komnenos Doukas, founder of the Despotate of Epirus, but this identification has been questioned more recently by Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, as the fragile nature of his control over Epirus would have made a departure to aid the Moreote Greeks a major and unlikely gamble.|$|E
5|$|Galen Clark {{retired as}} the state grant's {{guardian}} in 1896, leaving Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa <b>Grove</b> <b>of</b> Big Trees under ineffective stewardship. Pre-existing problems in the state grant worsened and new problems arose, but the cavalry could only monitor the situation. Muir and the Sierra Club continued to lobby the government and influential people {{for the creation of}} a unified Yosemite National Park. The Sierra Club began to organize annual trips to Yosemite in 1901 in an effort to make the remote area more accessible.|$|E
60|$|<b>Groves</b> <b>of</b> {{babies in}} arms; <b>groves</b> <b>of</b> mothers and other sick women in bed; <b>groves</b> <b>of</b> lunatics; jungles {{of men in}} stone-paved down-stairs day-rooms, waiting for their dinners; longer and longer <b>groves</b> <b>of</b> old people, in up-stairs Infirmary wards, wearing out life, God knows how - this was the scenery through which the walk lay, for two hours. In some of these latter chambers, there were {{pictures}} stuck against the wall, and a neat display of crockery and pewter {{on a kind of}} sideboard; now and then it was a treat to see a plant or two; in almost every ward there was a cat.|$|R

5|$|Hemingway's stories {{typically}} position {{nature as}} a source of refuge and rebirth. His characters are often shown retreating to the country in search of regeneration. Nature acts as the setting for hunters' or fishermen's existential moment of transcendence—especially at the moment when prey is killed. In Big Two-Hearted River, Nick walks away from a ruined town, and enters the woods to hike toward the river, unharmed by the fire. His journey is motivated by absolution; the river is described as two-hearted because it gives life in the form of food (fish) and offers redemption. In the woods, Nick stops in a <b>grove</b> <b>of</b> trees that is described as chapel-like, a description that echoes Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage in which Henry Fleming flees to a chapel-like <b>grove</b> <b>of</b> trees. In the grove Nick sleeps well {{for the first time since}} the war, and there he begins the healing process. The next morning he goes to the river, wading into the water to fish. At first the strength of the current frightens him, and for some moments he has difficulty controlling himself.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, settler Galen Clark {{discovered}} the Mariposa <b>Grove</b> <b>of</b> giant sequoia at Wawona, an indigenous encampment {{in what is}} now the southwestern part of the park. Clark completed a bridge over the South Fork of the Merced River in 1857 at Wawona for traffic headed toward Yosemite Valley and provided a way station for travelers on the road the Mann brothers built to the valley.|$|E

40|$|Sacred <b>groves</b> are patches <b>of</b> {{vegetation}} preserved due to  {{religious or}} cultural tradition.   They are protected through spiritual beliefs.   Sacred groves provide an excellent abode to the biodiversity {{of the region}} where they are located.   Scientific exploration of fauna from sacred <b>groves</b> <b>of</b> India is few and far between.   The present {{study was conducted to}} explore the bird diversity and abundance in 15 selected sacred <b>groves</b> <b>of</b> northern Kerala, eight from Kannur District and seven from Kasargod District each.   A total of 111 bird species were observed belonging to 49 families and 16 orders.   The sacred <b>groves</b> <b>of</b> northern Kerala support many of the ‘forest-birds’ such as the Grey Junglefowl Gallus sonneratii, Asian Fairy-bluebird Irena puella, Tickell’s Blue-flycatcher Cyornis tickelliae, Malabar Trogon Harpactes fasciatus, Heart-spotted Woodpecker Hemicircus canente, Malabar Whistling-Thrush Myophonus horsfieldii, Little Spiderhunter Arachnothera longirostra, etc.   The sacred <b>groves</b> <b>of</b> northern Kerala also support two endemic bird species of the Western Ghats, such as the Malabar Grey Hornbill Ocyceros griseus and Rufous Babbler Turdoides subrufa. Five species of raptors and four owl species were reported from the sacred <b>groves</b> <b>of</b> north Kerala during the present study.   The breeding of the White-bellied Sea-Eagle has been reported at Edayilakadu Kavu, a sacred grove in Kasargod District.   The sacred <b>groves</b> <b>of</b> northern Kerala also supported 17 species of long distant migratory birds.   Thazhe Kavu, recorded the Black-headed Ibis Threskiornis melanocephalus, a Near-Threatened bird according to IUCN.  </div...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, a Crusader {{force of}} between 500 and 700 knights {{under the command}} of William of Champlitte and Geoffrey I of Villehardouin {{advanced}} into the Peloponnese to deal with Byzantine resistance. In the Olive <b>Grove</b> <b>of</b> Kountouras in Messenia, they confronted an army of around 5,000 Peloponnesian Greeks {{under the command of}} a certain Michael. In the ensuing battle, the Crusaders emerged victorious, forcing the Byzantines to retreat and crushing resistance in the Peloponnese. This battle {{paved the way for the}} foundation of the Principality of Achaea.|$|E
5|$|Pressure from Starr King and Olmsted, {{photographs}} by Carleton Watkins, and geological {{data from the}} 1863 Geological Survey of California prompted legislators to take action. Senator John Conness of California introduced a park bill in 1864 to the United States Senate to cede Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa <b>Grove</b> <b>of</b> Big Trees to California.|$|E
5|$|Simple lodgings, {{later called}} the Lower Hotel, were {{completed}} soon afterward; the Upper Hotel, later renamed Hutchings House and eventually known as Cedar Cottage, was opened in 1859. In 1876, the more substantial Wawona Hotel {{was built to}} serve tourists visiting the nearby <b>grove</b> <b>of</b> big trees and those {{on their way to}} Yosemite Valley. Aaron Harris opened the first campground business in Yosemite in 1876.|$|E

5|$|Supporting a large {{population}} of salmon and trout, the Chetco's water is of very high quality. The watershed is home to many other species, including several that are endemic to the Siskiyou Mountains area. The northernmost <b>grove</b> <b>of</b> Redwoods—the tallest trees on Earth—grow in the southern region of the Chetco's drainage basin. In total, the river is home to over 200species of animals, and 97percent of the watershed is forested.|$|E
5|$|The {{survivors}} of Marsyas fell {{back to a}} sacred <b>grove</b> <b>of</b> Zeus at Labraunda and deliberated whether to surrender to the Persians or to flee Asia altogether. However, while deliberating, {{they were joined by}} a Milesian army, and with these reinforcements resolved instead to carry on fighting. The Persians then attacked the army at Labraunda, and inflicted an even heavier defeat, with the Milesians suffering particularly bad casualties.|$|E
5|$|Wawona was an Indian encampment {{in what is}} now {{the southwestern}} part of the park. Settler Galen Clark {{discovered}} the Mariposa <b>Grove</b> <b>of</b> giant sequoia in Wawona in 1857. He had simple lodgings built, and roads to the area. In 1879, the Wawona Hotel was built to serve tourists visiting Mariposa Grove.

5|$|A <b>grove</b> <b>of</b> {{enormous}} incense cedars exists near Diamond Lake, {{and there}} is a forest of ponderosa pine at the nearby Emile Big Tree Trail. The Umpqua National Forest features swordferns and Douglas firs. Rocky Mountain elks, pronghorns, and mule deer, bobcats, black bears, and mountain lions live in the Fremont–Winema National Forest. The forest's rivers support populations of trout, and the lakes contain fish such as the largemouth bass. The forest is inhabited by avian species such as mallards, American bald eagles, Canada geese, and whistling swans. Peregrine falcons and Warner suckers also infrequently enter its boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Freshmen were {{expected}} to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth. For almost two decades, the students constructed Bonfire from debris and wood acquired through various, sometimes illicit, means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912. In 1935, a farmer reported that students carried off his entire barn as fuel for Bonfire. To prevent future incidents, the university made Bonfire a school-sanctioned event. The following year, for the first time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for the students and pointed them toward a <b>grove</b> <b>of</b> dead trees {{on the edge of}} town.|$|E
5|$|In 1864, Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa <b>Grove</b> <b>of</b> {{giant sequoia}} trees were {{transferred}} from federal to state ownership. Yosemite pioneer Galen Clark became the park's first guardian. Conditions in Yosemite Valley were made more hospitable {{to people and}} access to the park was improved in the late 19th century. Naturalist John Muir and others became increasingly alarmed about the excessive exploitation of the area. Their efforts helped establish Yosemite National Park in 1890. Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were added to the national park in 1906.|$|E

The security forces soon set up a guard post and a fence around the grove. They then obtain an order to uproot the lemon trees.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{location}} of the olive <b>grove</b> <b>of</b> Kountouras in Messenia is unknown; the Greek version of the Chronicle records, apart from the owner's name (Kountouras or the variant form Koundouron), a location name Kepeskianous (Κηπησκιάνους), while a variant form is recorded as Kapsikia (Καψικία). Efforts {{have been made to}} identify the locality, with some linking it with the modern village of Kapsia west of Mantinea in Arcadia, but this is too far from the reported area of the battle based on the sources, and furthermore olive trees do not grow in the region.|$|E
5|$|Heathen rites {{often take}} place in non-public spaces, {{particularly}} in a practitioner's home. In other cases, Heathen places of worship have been established on plots of land specifically purchased for the purpose; these can represent either a hörg, which is a sanctified place within nature like a <b>grove</b> <b>of</b> trees, or a hof, which is a wooden temple. The Heathen community has made various attempts to construct hofs {{in different parts of}} the world. In 2014 the Ásaheimur Temple was opened in Efri Ás, Skagafjörður, Iceland, while in 2015 a British Heathen group called the Odinist Fellowship opened a temple in a converted 16th-century chapel in Newark, Nottinghamshire. Heathens have also adopted archaeological sites as places of worship. For instance, British practitioners have assembled for rituals at the Nine Ladies stone circle in Derbyshire, the Rollright Stones in Warwickshire, and the White Horse Stone in Kent. Swedish Heathens have done the same at Gamla Uppsala, and Icelandic practitioners have met at Þingvellir.|$|E
