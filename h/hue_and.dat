5|$|On March 17, the North Vietnamese High Command {{predicted}} that South Vietnamese units could withdraw into {{the cities of}} <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> Da Nang, so the following orders were issued to North Vietnamese field commanders: General Lê Tự Đồng's forces were to capture Phu Bai Air Base to prevent aerial transportation, and cut off a section of Highway 1 north of <b>Huế,</b> <b>and</b> General Nguyen Huu An's 2nd Army Corps must secure Highway 1 south of the city, {{with the aim of}} isolating both <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> Da Nang {{from the rest of the}} country.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} season of 1975, the Vietnam People's Army High Command in Hanoi made the {{decision}} to seize the major South Vietnamese cities of <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> Da Nang, and also destroy the various South Vietnamese units in I Corps Tactical Zone, led by ARVN General Ngô Quang Trưởng. Originally, the campaign was planned to take place over two phases; during the seasons of spring-summer and autumn. However, as the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces rolled over South Vietnamese defences on the outskirts of <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> Da Nang, President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu ordered General Trưởng to abandon all territories under his control, and pull his forces back to the coastal areas of I Corps. However, the South Vietnamese withdrawal quickly turned into a rout, as the North Vietnamese 2nd Army Corps picked off one South Vietnamese unit after another, until <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> Da Nang was completely surrounded. By March 29, 1975, North Vietnamese troops had full control of <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> Da Nang, while South Vietnam lost all territories in I Corps and most of the units belonging to the ARVN 1st Brigade.|$|E

5|$|General Trưởng was {{recalled}} to Saigon on 19 March {{to brief}} Thiệu on his withdrawal plan. The general developed two contingency plans: The first was predicated on government control of Highway 1, {{which would be}} utilized for two simultaneous withdrawals from <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> Chu Lai to Da Nang; The second course presupposed PAVN interdiction of the highway {{and called for a}} withdrawal into three enclaves: Huế, Da Nang, and Chu Lai. This was to be only an interim measure, however, since the forces that withdrew to <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> Chu Lai would then be sea-lifted to Da Nang by the navy. The president then stunned the general by announcing he misinterpreted his previous orders: The old imperial capital of Huế was not to be abandoned. Making matters worse, Trưởng discovered that his force was to be reduced by the removal of the Marine Division.|$|E

5|$|The {{struggle}} for <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> Da Nang had cost South Vietnam its entire army corps, namely the {{units of the}} ARVN 1st Brigade, I Corps Tactical Zone. According to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam's official history, apart from the 16,000 soldiers and civilians who managed to escape, over 120,000 South Vietnamese soldiers were killed, wounded or captured {{after the fall of}} <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> Da Nang. In their attempt to abandon the territories of I Corps, the South Vietnamese military left behind vast quantities of U.S.-supplied military hardware. The North Vietnamese claimed to have captured 129 aircraft of different models, 179 tanks and armoured vehicles, 327 artillery pieces, 184 transport vehicles and 47 naval crafts. More than 10,000 tons of bombs, ammunition, grenades, food supplies, combat rations, and other materials were also captured. Total North Vietnamese and Viet Cong casualties are largely unknown.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of March 25, the North Vietnamese had secured all major points {{surrounding}} <b>Huế,</b> <b>and</b> South Vietnamese units that failed to escape were completely surrounded. Consequently, the North Vietnamese claimed to have captured large numbers of South Vietnamese prisoners and military hardware. In all, a total of 58,722 South Vietnamese soldiers became prisoners of war, with one colonel and 18 lieutenant-colonels amongst the ranks, as well as about 14,000 South Vietnamese government officials and employees, who reported to the North Vietnamese military authorities. The South Vietnamese military in Huế also surrendered vast quantities of weaponry, which included 140 tanks and armoured vehicles.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the very}} next day, Thiệu ordered Trưởng and General Lâm Quang Thi to abandon <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> to {{concentrate}} only sufficient numbers of South Vietnamese units to hold Da Nang. On March 29, as Trưởng was about to board the navy transport ship HQ-404, he {{received a phone call}} from Thiệu, who ordered him to turn back and retake Da Nang from the North Vietnamese forces. By then, however, South Vietnamese units in I Corps had virtually disappeared, and their commanding officers had fled from their posts.|$|E

5|$|In another project, {{the village}} of La Vang in Quảng Trị Province near the border with North Vietnam, {{was the scene of}} a female {{apparition}} in the late 19th century. Buddhists claimed that the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (also known as Kuanyin; Vietnamese: Quan Âm) performed the miracle. Diệm's brother, Ngô Đình Thục, was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> the foremost religious figure in South Vietnam's nepotistic regime. Thục declared that the apparition was the Virgin Mary, and ordered that a cathedral be built in place of the makeshift Buddhist pagoda that occupied the site. Thơ made notable financial donations to the project for political reasons.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Nguyễn Ánh {{had stayed}} in Siam with a {{contingent}} of troops until August 1787. His soldiers served in Siam's war against Bodawpaya of Burma (1785–86). Having consolidated their hold on southern Vietnam, the Tây Sơn decided to move north to unify the country. However, the withdrawal of troops from the Gia Định garrison weakened them their hold on the south. This was compounded by reports that Nguyễn Nhạc was being attacked near Qui Nhơn by his own brother Nguyễn <b>Huệ,</b> <b>and</b> that more Tây Sơn troops were being evacuated from Gia Dinh by their commander Dang Van Tran in order to aid Nguyễn Nhạc. Sensing Tây Sơn vulnerability in the south, Nguyễn Ánh assembled his forces {{at home and abroad}} in preparation for an immediate offensive.|$|E
5|$|The Ho Chi Minh Campaign {{commenced}} on March 9, 1975 and by mid-March the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) {{had withdrawn}} from the Central Highlands. The Republic of Vietnam Air Force 6th Air Force Division had been given only 48 hours to evacuate its aircraft and personnel from Pleiku Air Base leaving 64 aircraft intact, including 36 aircraft in flyable storage, and no attempt were made to put those aircraft into commission. On March 27 with South Vietnamese forces of I Corps facing imminent defeat, Republic of Vietnam Air Force Brigadier-General Nguyen Duc Khanh, commander of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force 1st Air Force Division, was ordered to evacuate all flyable aircraft from <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> Da Nang.|$|E

5|$|The fall of <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> Da Nang did not {{spell the}} end of the misery {{suffered}} by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. On March 31, ARVN General Phạm Văn Phú—commander of II Corps Tactical Zone—attempted to form a new defensive line from Qui Nhơn to cover the retreat of the ARVN 22nd Infantry Division into the Mekong Delta, but they too were destroyed by the North Vietnamese. By April 2, South Vietnam had lost control of the northern provinces, as well as two army corps.|$|E
5|$|Vietnamese {{documentation}} {{challenges the}} French assertions. The imperial records, written communications between Gian and Định, and {{the account of}} the southern insurgency written by a resistance figure named Nguyen Thong support the contention that Định's guerrillas operated independently of <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> in violation of its orders. The imperial records hold that Tự Đức immediately ordered the insurgents to disband, fearing that their actions were an obstacle to his plan of negotiating the return of the lost territory. The records assert that Tự Đức ordered his officials to prevent the insurgents from returning to independent Vietnamese land and to arrest those who did so. Messengers were sent from Huế into the south with the intention of discouraging the insurgents, rather than fomenting resistance.|$|E
5|$|According to many academics, both in Vietnam {{and in the}} West, {{the major}} factor which contributed to the rapid {{collapse}} of South Vietnamese defences in 1975 was the numerous and contradictory orders issued by President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. During the various phases of the South Vietnamese retreat from the northern provinces, namely in I and II Corps Tactical Zones, Thiệu had at least three different plans and decisions laid out before him, and all lacked consistency or simply contradicted one another. For example, on March 13, Thiệu ordered General Ngô Quang Trưởng to abandon I Corps, and return the elite Airborne Division to the Mekong Delta region of III Corps. Soon afterwards, similar orders were issued to Major-General Phạm Văn Phú to evacuate from the Central Highlands. On March 17, with intervention from General Cao Văn Viên, Thiệu contradicted his previous orders when he approved Trưởng's defensive plan to hold the major cities of <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> Da Nang.|$|E

Despite some {{speculation}} at the time, no member of Huang Chung was actually a member of Blanket of Secrecy — that band consisted of Roger Bechirian, Andrew Howell and Pete Marsh, operating under the pseudonyms Tinker, Soldier, and Tailor.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, the North Vietnamese {{offensive}} {{was slowly}} rolling over ARVN opposition {{north and south}} of Da Nang. General Dong's plan called for attacks on the area from the west, north, and south that would drive South Vietnamese forces into Da Nang, where they could be destroyed. The highway between <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> Da Nang was cut at Phu Loc after severe fighting on 22 March. South of Da Nang, the 2nd ARVN Division barely managed to contain a North Vietnamese drive toward Tam Kỳ and the coastal plain. On the morning of 24 March, however, the 711th Division, backed by armored elements, seized Tam Kỳ, driving the population north toward Da Nang by the thousands. PAVN forces then cut Highway 1 between Quảng Ngãi and Chu Lai, a move to which the 2nd ARVN Division was too battered to respond. With Corps approval, South Vietnamese troops from Quảng Ngãi fought their way northward, but only a few managed to reach Chu Lai. In a single day the situation in I Corps had deteriorated beyond control.|$|E
5|$|On February 21, 1975, North Vietnamese field commanders from Tri-Thien Military Zone and the 2nd Army Corps held {{a conference}} to {{establish}} their objectives, which were planned to occur in two phases; the spring-summer phase that would begin in March and probably conclude in May, and the autumn phase to last from July to August 1975. The North Vietnamese objective was {{to take control of}} Quảng Trị Province, isolate the city of <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> if the opportunity presents itself, they would capture the entire Tri Thien-Huế area. To isolate Huế, the North Vietnamese 2nd Army Corps would move against their target from the north-west direction along Route 12 down to the south-west along Highway 14, thereby isolating the region from South Vietnamese forces in II Corps Tactical Zone.|$|E
5|$|South Vietnamese {{military}} forces in <b>Huế</b> <b>and</b> Da Nang belonged to the ARVN 1st Brigade, I Corps Tactical Zone. Commanded by Lieutenant General Ngô Quang Trưởng, the South Vietnamese I Corps {{was considered to be}} the strongest amongst all the military formations of South Vietnam. It had three infantry divisions (1st, 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions), the Airborne Division (led by Major General Le Quang Luong), the Marine Corps Division (led by Major General Bui The Lan), and four ranger groups (11th, 12th, 14th and 15th Ranger Groups). The Airborne and Marine Corps Division each had an assigned strength of four brigades. In addition to the infantry units, there were also the 5th Armoured Brigade, five squadrons of armored vehicles (4th, 7th, 11th, 17th and 20th Armored Squadrons), 13 armored companies, and 21 artillery battalions.|$|E
