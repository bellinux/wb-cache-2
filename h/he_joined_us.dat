5|$|Henry is of Antillean heritage: his father, Antoine, is from Guadeloupe (La Désirade island), and his mother, Maryse, is from Martinique. He {{was born}} and raised in Les Ulis suburb of Paris which, despite {{sometimes}} being seen as a tough neighbourhood, provided good footballing facilities. As a seven-year-old, Henry showed great potential, prompting Claude Chezelle to recruit him to the local club CO Les Ulis. His father pressured him to attend training, although the youngster was not particularly drawn to football. <b>He</b> <b>joined</b> <b>US</b> Palaiseau in 1989, but after a year his father fell out with the club, so Henry moved to ES Viry-Châtillon and played there for two years. US Palaiseau coach Jean-Marie Panza, Henry's future mentor, followed him there.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, Wattenberg joined Schenley Industries, a {{distiller}} of whiskey, {{where he}} performed spectroscopic analysis. <b>He</b> <b>joined</b> <b>US</b> Steel in 1940. The consequential increase in salary and reduction in working hours to 30 {{hours per week}} enabled {{him to go back}} to graduate school at Columbia University to get his PhD. In 1941, his studies were interrupted by World War II. Enrico Fermi asked him to join the group at Columbia working on the nuclear fission of uranium that also included Herbert L. Anderson, Bernard T. Feld, Leo Szilard and Walter Zinn. Wattenberg learned how to build and maintain the Geiger counters and photon and neutron detectors.|$|E
25|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century, the U.S. Government had begun sending {{surveying}} expeditions into the newly incorporated territories of the American West. Albert Bierstadt ventured {{on at least}} two of these expeditions, which, along with other trips in the West, would inspire an incredible amount of his creative output. On his first expedition in 1859, <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>U.S.</b> explorer Frederick W. Lander, taking photographs of Native Americans and painting field sketches of the landscape. They traveled through Kansas, Nebraska, and into the Wind River Range of the Rocky Mountains in Wyoming. This expedition resulted in paintings such as On the Sweetwater Near the Devil's Gate, Nebraska; Sunset Light, Wind River Range of the Rocky Mountains; Thunderstorm in the Rockies; and most notably, two works similarly titled The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak.|$|E

2500|$|He {{worked for}} the Kansas City Royals from 1993 to 1994 and for the Baltimore Orioles in 1995. Phil Regan, who had been friends with Boros since the 1950s, hired Boros at Baltimore and later recalled, [...] "When I became the manager at Baltimore in 1995, {{one of my first}} calls was to Steve and <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> as my third-base coach. Steve was one of the finest baserunning {{instructors}} of his time. He {{was one of the first}} guys to always have a stop watch in his hand to clock both runners and the time it takes for a pitcher to throw to first base." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 28 December 2010, Ichilov Hospital {{declared}} that Cohen was brain dead. His brain death {{was confirmed by}} his son Tamir later the same day. Paying tribute to Cohen, Kenny Dalglish said [...] "Avi was a lovely man who will be remembered fondly by everyone at Liverpool who knew him. He quickly integrated himself into the football club when <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> and {{spent a lot of}} time learning English which really made him popular. He was well liked by all the lads and although he didn't spend a long time at the club, he certainly left his mark and no-one will forget how he helped us win the league against Aston Villa. My thoughts and those of everyone connected to the club are with Avi's family." [...] Ally McCoist said [...] "we knew his situation was bad but never for a second did we think it would come to this" [...] before going on to say it was [...] "so sad to hear that he has passed away." ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{presence}} as <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> there Banished our words of warmth away; We felt, with cloudings of despair, [...] What Love must lose that day.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{graduation}} from University of Mississippi, <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Navy. <b>He</b> was commissioned an ensign.|$|R
50|$|In June 1918, <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Navy as a {{hospital}} apprentice, and served until January 1919.|$|R
50|$|Ten {{months before}} the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> the <b>US</b> Army in March 1941.|$|R
60|$|When {{the bear}} and I, {{with the rest}} of the party, were fairly out of sight of the house, we stopped and waited for Mr. Larramie, and it was not long before <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E
60|$|Before we {{had come}} to an end of our eating it was {{possible}} to hear the outer door swung to with no little force, and there was a look of satisfaction upon Griffin's face as <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> at the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "We are short-handed {{enough as}} it is," [...] he told me, when <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> on the poop. [...] "We can't {{afford to lose}} him {{even if he is}} crazy. We need him. He's a good sailor most of the time." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 1951 <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Air Force for a {{four-year}} {{tour of duty}} and reenlisted for another four-year term in 1955.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well then, M. Chapeau," [...] (he had learnt Chapeau's name), [...] "I cannot {{say that}} I do exactly {{know how he}} was {{generally}} called before <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> in Brittany. You know {{so many people have}} different names for different places. What used you to call him now when you knew him?" ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{had promised}} I {{prepared}} to do as I was told, and giving my hand to the lady, I escorted her, {{by the light of}} the moon, to the place of which the prince had spoken. We had barely reached it when <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> himself, carrying a small vessel of water, a pickaxe, and a little bag containing plaster.|$|E
60|$|At the old boat-house <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> again. I {{will put}} down the {{conversation}} that ensued when we were all settled in our places exactly as it passed. It is an important conversation, so far as I am concerned, for it has seriously disposed me to distrust the influence which Count Fosco has exercised over my thoughts and feelings, and to resist it for the future as resolutely as I can.|$|E
60|$|And while Bill or Jerry or Tom is {{beginning}} to unlimber his thinking and speaking apparatus, I suggest that <b>he</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> in the drink. Then discussions arise about the advisability of this road or that, what the best stopping-places may be, what running time I may expect to make, where the best trout streams are, and so forth, in which other men join, and which are punctuated with more drinks.|$|R
6000|$|... "We have {{a trained}} army at our disposal," [...] Monsieur de Founcelles continued, [...] "who numerically, {{as well as}} in intelligence, outnumber the whole force of gendarmes in Paris. No {{criminal}} from any other country can settle down here and hope for success, unless <b>he</b> <b>joins</b> <b>us.</b> An exploit which is inspired by us cannot fail. Our agents may count on our protection, and receive it without question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother imagines that I am the slavish echo of {{my brother}} Victor. It is not so. He {{understand}}s me better than I can understand him. When <b>he</b> <b>joins</b> <b>us</b> and you come to know him you will see what an exceptional soul it is." [...] She paused. [...] "He is not a strong man in the conventional sense, you know," [...] she added. [...] "But his character is without a flaw." ...|$|R
6000|$|Reached Walmer Castle about 6.30. Found Gladstone {{lying in}} [...] {{blankets}} on the ramparts eating his dinner, looking still very [...] ill.... <b>He</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> at night full of intelligence. His fierce [...] vigour {{all the better}} for being a little tempered.... Much [...] interesting conversation {{about the state of}} the church and [...] morality in Wales, also about leading ecclesiastics. I gather that [...] he will certainly nominate Temple for a bishopric.(185) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And Pensilo, the Spanish Don! A great captain, {{but a man}} {{absolutely}} without {{bowels of}} compassion. When first <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> and saw our mark upon the foreheads of our dead, wishing to out-Herod Herod, he marked the living which fell into his hands with a red hot iron, branding a great P upon each cheek and burning out the right eye completely. Wouldst like to feel, Father, that Don Piedro Castro y Pensilo ranged free through forest and hill of England? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By Saint Bugo, dear Karl, I say sooth. The {{fellow was}} known i' the camp of the crusaders--disreputably known. Ere <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> in Palestine, he had sojourned in Constantinople, and learned {{the arts of}} the Greek. He is a cogger of dice, I tell thee--a chanter of horseflesh. He won five {{thousand}} marks from bluff Richard of England {{the night before the}} storming of Ascalon, and I caught him with false trumps in his pocket. He warranted a bay mare to Conrad of Mont Serrat, and the rogue had fired her." ...|$|E
50|$|David Gonzales was a {{semi-skilled}} {{machine shop}} worker in Los Angeles when <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Army at the San Pedro, California in March 1944.|$|R
50|$|Holland {{was born}} in Inchicore, Dublin. A skilled {{association}} football player, he spent time in the United States, where <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> the <b>US</b> Marine Corps.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> the <b>US</b> voice cast of Thomas & Friends as Thomas the Tank Engine {{starting}} with Thomas & Friends: The Adventure Begins.|$|R
60|$|We {{went into}} the hotel, {{and a few minutes}} later <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us.</b> Now that we were {{actually}} at the table, I confess that the idea of breakfast was by no means repugnant to me. The keen air and the exercise had given me an appetite, and it was some little time before I was able to assure the waiter definitely that he could cease bringing orders of scrambled eggs. The others having finished also, I suggested a move. I was anxious to get the match over and be free to go home.|$|E
60|$|Another person {{interrupted}} us, whom I {{recognized as}} the elder brother of Monsieur Bonnefoy--already mentioned in these pages, {{under the name of}} Uncle David. Having left France for political reasons, the old republican had taken care of his niece after her father's death, and had accepted the position of Jeanne's business manager in her relations with the stage. Uncle David's object, when <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> in the garden, was to remind her that she was wanted at rehearsal, and must at once return with him to the theater. We parted, having arranged that I was to see the performance on that night.|$|E
60|$|Apart {{from a very}} {{complete}} {{staff of}} servants there were only four {{of us in the}} household. These were Miss Witherton, who was at that time four-and-twenty and as pretty--well, as pretty as Mrs. Colmore is now--myself, Frank Colmore, aged thirty, Mrs. Stevens, the housekeeper, a dry, silent woman, and Mr. Richards, a tall military-looking man, who acted as steward to the Bollamore estates. We four always had our meals together, but Sir John had his usually alone in the library. Sometimes <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> at dinner, but on the whole we were just as glad when he did not.|$|E
