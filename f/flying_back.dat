According to security officials, {{the man was}} planning attacks for Hezbollah in Cyprus and admitted this after questioning. The police were alerted about the man due to an urgent message from Israeli intelligence. The Lebanese man was in possession of photographs of Israeli targets and had information on Israeli airlines <b>flying</b> <b>back</b> and forth from Cyprus, and planned {{to blow up a}} plane or tour bus. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Iran assisted the Lebanese man with planning the attacks.|$|E
5|$|Waugh {{managed to}} extend his leave until June 1944. Soon after his return to duty he was {{recruited}} by Randolph Churchill to serve in a military mission to Yugoslavia, and, early in July, flew with Churchill from Bari, Italy, to the Croatian island of Vis. There, they met Marshal Tito, the Communist leader of the Partisans, who was leading the guerrilla fight against the occupying Axis forces with Allied support. Waugh and Churchill returned to Bari before <b>flying</b> <b>back</b> to Yugoslavia to begin their mission, but their aeroplane crash-landed, both men were injured, and their mission was delayed for a month.|$|E
5|$|In May 1932, Kalep {{traveled}} from France to New York on the steamship SS Paris {{with the intention}} of <b>flying</b> <b>back</b> to Europe across the Atlantic Ocean; at the time, no woman had made a solo transatlantic flight. She befriended American aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart, who, unbeknownst to Kalep, was planning a similar feat. After Earhart's successful flight from Canada to Ireland on 20 May, Kalep decided {{that it would not be}} worthwhile to make her own attempt at flying across the Atlantic, since she would no longer be the first woman to do so. She continued to encourage other women to enter the field of aviation, however, and became a member of the Ninety-Nines, an international organisation for women pilots which was founded by Earhart and 98 other female aviators. In August 1932, Kalep planned to fly with Roger Q. Williams from Los Angeles to Athens to celebrate the former city's hosting of the 1932 Summer Olympics, but their flight was canceled. Soon after, it was reported that Kalep had remarried to W. E. Hutton-Miller, an American stockbroker.|$|E

5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} feeds mainly on insects caught in flight, {{although}} it will occasionally {{feed on the}} ground. Breeding birds often feed close to their nesting territory, <b>flying</b> <b>back</b> and forth along a rock face catching insects in their bills. Cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. Crag martins exploit the area close to the cliff when they hunt, relying on their high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns. When not breeding, they may also hunt low over open ground. The insects caught depend on what is locally available, but may include mosquitoes, flies, Hymenoptera, ants and beetles. This martin often feeds alone, but sizeable groups may gather at grass fires to feast on the fleeing insects, and outside the breeding season flocks of up to 300may form where food is abundant, such as agricultural areas, wetlands and sewage works. The pale crag martin drinks in flight as it skims the water surface, although {{at least some of}} its water requirement is obtained from the insects it consumes. Wintering hirundines of other species are not normally found in the dry, rocky areas in which the pale crag martin nests, so there is little competition for food.|$|E

25|$|In 1942, a {{new field}} {{commander}} was required in the Middle East, where Auchinleck was fulfilling both the role of Commander-in-chief Middle East Command and commander Eighth Army. He had stabilised the Allied position at the First Battle of El Alamein, but after a visit in August 1942, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, replaced him as Commander-in-chief with General Sir Harold Alexander and William Gott as commander of the Eighth Army in the Western Desert. After Gott was killed <b>flying</b> <b>back</b> to Cairo Churchill was persuaded by Brooke, who by this time was Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), to appoint Montgomery, who had only just been nominated to replace Alexander as commander of the British ground forces for Operation Torch.|$|E
25|$|After she has {{fixed the}} {{position}} of the nest, she begins to build the nest. She repeats the procedure of bringing in a pulp, attaching it to the nest to form a spindle and <b>flying</b> <b>back</b> out to bring in more pulps. During this process, the queen clings to the nest with her two posterior pairs of legs and attaches the pulp using her anterior legs and mouth parts. She builds 20–30 cells before initial egg-laying, fashioning a petiole and producing a single cell at the end of it. Six further cells are then added around this to produce the characteristic hexagonal shape of the nest cells. One egg is laid in each cell, and as it hatches, each larva holds itself in the vertical cell by pressing its body against the sides.|$|E
