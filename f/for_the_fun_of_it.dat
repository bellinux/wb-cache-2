25|$|Another curiosity is his Hidden Mickeys. Rosa is only {{interested}} in creating stories featuring the Duck family, but he often hides small Mickey Mouse heads or figures in the pictures, sometimes in a humiliating or unwanted situation. An {{example of this is}} in the story The Terror of the Transvaal where a flat Mickey can be seen under an elephant's foot. This is mostly a gag done <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Rosa has admitted to neither liking nor disliking Mickey Mouse, but being indifferent to him.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1998, Dan Nastasi & John Milnes {{joined forces}} with former Mucky Pup and Dog Eat Dog bandmates Dave Neabore & Sean Kilkenny to become All Boro Kings. The project was {{a throwback to the}} early days of Dog Eat Dog as it focused on the {{hardcore}} style that Dog Eat Dog had originally displayed on their first two releases. The band quickly signed with Century Media Records who released their debut album Just <b>For</b> <b>The</b> <b>Fun</b> <b>Of</b> <b>It</b> in 2002. The album was released exclusively in Europe due to the strong European fan base the members had in their other bands. The band would also appear on several compilation albums. The band played most of their shows in and around New Jersey before embarking on one European tour with Biohazard, Agnostic Front, Hatebreed, Discipline, Death Threat and Born From Pain, as part of the Eastpak Resistance Tour. In 2004, All Boro Kings quietly disbanded.|$|E

500|$|Russian poet, {{novelist and}} {{composer}} Mikhail Kuzmin (1872–1936) {{is known to}} have patronized bathhouses. Some of the bathhouses in St. Petersburg at the time became known as friendly to gay men and provided [...] "attendants", who might provide sexual services for a fee.

2500|$|Coming Up for Air, {{his last}} novel before World War II {{is the most}} [...] "English" [...] of his novels; alarms of war mingle with images of idyllic Thames-side Edwardian {{childhood}} of protagonist George Bowling. The novel is pessimistic; industrialism and capitalism have killed the best of Old England, and there were great, new external threats. In homely terms, Bowling posits the totalitarian hypotheses of Borkenau, Orwell, Silone and Koestler: [...] "Old Hitler's something different. So's Joe Stalin. They aren't like these chaps {{in the old days}} who crucified people and chopped their heads off and so forth, just <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>it...</b> They're something quite new – something that's never been heard of before".|$|E
2500|$|His {{first stage}} {{appearance}} was at age 13 but his early hopes {{of becoming a}} serious actor were dashed when he failed an audition for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He began to entertain during World War II service in the British Army. It was {{at this time that}} he adapted his surname to Howerd [...] "to be different". In 1944 he became a bombardier in Plymouth, was promoted to sergeant, and on 6 June 1944 was part of the D-Day effort but was stuck on a boat off Normandy. Despite suffering from stage fright, he continued to work after the war, beginning his professional career in the summer of 1946 in a touring show called <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>It.</b>|$|E

2500|$|After {{almost four}} years, Elliott {{came out of}} {{retirement}} {{on the national level}} on Saturday October 28, 1989, when she raced the ABA's Fall National in Yorba Linda, Californiaapparently <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> due to her ABA BMX Hall of Fame induction the following November. She probably thought she would be at the ABA Grand Nationals anyway for her acceptance speech, why not race as well? Other reports have it that Elliott was lured out of retirement by the Bicycle Center bicycle shop as a [...] "spoiler" [...] to better position other Bicycle Center racers to take various titles. Whatever the reason, prior to the Fall Nationals she was seen practicing at the Roseville, California Oak Creek BMX track. She dominated the 15 & Over girls' class at the Fall Nationals on Saturday. However, she slipped her pedals in the Main and finished in seventh place—last, in this case—in the main. On Sunday, she again came in last (out of six) in the main.|$|E
