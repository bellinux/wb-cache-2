She played an engaged woman who develops a one-sided attraction to her commitment-phobic co-worker. Khan said about Kapoor's craft, [...] "We'd be shooting {{a scene from}} multiple angles—for {{three or four hours}} you're doing the same scene, the same lines—and <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> person [...] who brings consistency to her work, from the way she talks, to her accent." [...] Although Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express called Kapoor's performance [...] "stiff and rehearsed", Daily News and Analysis Johnson Thomas found her [...] "likeable and believable". I Hate Luv Storys was Kapoor's first commercial success, earning [...] worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Various interpretations {{have been}} {{suggested}} for the feather present at the opening and conclusion of the film. Sarah Lyall of The New York Times noted several suggestions made about the feather: [...] "Does the white feather symbolize the unbearable lightness of being? Forrest Gump's impaired intellect? The randomness of experience?" [...] Hanks interpreted the feather as: [...] "Our destiny is only defined by {{how we deal with}} the chance elements to our life and that's kind of the embodiment of the feather as it comes in. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications that are really huge." [...] Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: [...] "It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there. Was it planned or was it just perchance?" [...] Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: [...] "It can mean so many things to so many different people." ...|$|E
