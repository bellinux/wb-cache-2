25|$|Dynamic {{programming}} algorithms {{are often}} used for optimization. A dynamic programming algorithm will examine the previously solved subproblems and will combine their solutions to give the best solution for the given problem. In comparison, a greedy algorithm treats the solution as some sequence of steps and picks the locally optimal choice at each step. Using a greedy algorithm does not guarantee an optimal solution, because picking locally optimal choices {{may result in a}} bad <b>global</b> <b>solution,</b> but it is often faster to calculate. Some greedy algorithms (such as Kruskal's or Prim's for minimum spanning trees) are however proven to lead to the optimal solution.|$|E

Scientists have to acknowledge yet another threat: that of biological devolution, turning men and women into oversized mollusks. Decision-makers are incapable of finding a <b>global</b> <b>solution,</b> but coalesce into competing factions. Two engineers personify that trend: Whitt suggests moving civilization closer to the inner molten regions; Xavier, inventor of nuclear propulsion, wants spacecraft to resettle humans on another planet. While Whitt and his secretary dig into the seafloor, Xavier and his concubine Olivia (collectively dubbed X-O) make a solitary escape into the cosmos.|$|E

25|$|In fiber-optic communication, {{the path}} {{coloring}} {{problem is the}} problem of assigning colors (frequencies of light) to pairs of nodes that wish to communicate with each other, and paths through a fiber-optic communications network for each pair, subject to the restriction that no two paths that share a segment of fiber use the same frequency as each other. Paths that pass through the same communication switch but not through any segment of fiber are allowed to use the same frequency. When the communications network is arranged as a star network, with a single central switch connected by separate fibers to each of the nodes, the path coloring problem may be modeled exactly as a problem of edge coloring a graph or multigraph, in which the communicating nodes form the graph vertices, pairs of nodes that wish to communicate form the graph edges, and the frequencies that may be used for each pair form the colors of the edge coloring problem. For communications networks with a more general tree topology, local path coloring solutions for the star networks defined by each switch in the network may be patched together to form a single <b>global</b> <b>solution.</b>|$|E
500|$|Since Harper's {{government}} {{took office in}} 2006, Canadian greenhouse gas emissions fell from 749 to 726Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq). From 1993 until 2006, during the previous Liberal government greenhouse gas emissions increased from 600 to 749Mt of CO2 eq. The reduction corresponded Canada's decreased economic output during the Great Recession and emissions began increasing slightly in 2010, when the economy began recovering. Other significant factors in Canada's decreased emissions during Prime Minister Harper's time in office are initiatives such as the carbon tax in British Columbia, the cap and trade system in Quebec, Ontario's coal-fired power plants, and the Clean Air Regulatory Agenda which regulates emissions for automobiles and light trucks. In 2006, Canada's Clean Air and Climate Change Act was introduced to address air pollution as well as greenhouse gas emissions; it never became law. In 2006, the Clean Air Regulatory Agenda (CARA) was established to [...] "support Government of Canada efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions {{in order to improve}} the environment and health of Canadians". In December 2011, the Harper administration announced that Canada would formally withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol. Then Environment Minister Peter Kent stated, [...] "It's now clear that Kyoto is not the path forward for a <b>global</b> <b>solution</b> to [...] climate change. In December 2012, Canada became the first signatory to formally withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol. / ...|$|E

[...] argue that branchwidth works better than treewidth in the development of fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms on planar graphs, for multiple reasons: branchwidth may be more tightly bounded by a function of the parameter of interest than the bounds on treewidth, it can be computed exactly in polynomial time rather than merely approximated, and the algorithm for computing it has no large hidden constants.|$|E
