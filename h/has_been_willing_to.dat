5|$|As such, such trusts are not {{enforceable}} {{because they}} are invalid. Equity <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> accept their validity in the common law to prevent the trustee committing fraud and keeping the property; justifications for this acceptance are debated.|$|E
25|$|When {{it comes}} to {{contracts}} where one party disputed whether it had been properly formed, rather than the validity of a formed contract, the Court <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> let a court decide the issue. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for a unanimous court in First Options v. Kaplan that upheld a district-court decision reversing an arbitration award where {{it was not clear}} that the respondents had agreed to submit the arbitrability of the question to the arbitrator.|$|E
2500|$|The {{amount of}} {{information}} the United States government <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> provide regarding Area 51 has generally been minimal. The area surrounding the lake is permanently off-limits to both civilian and normal military air traffic. Security clearances are checked regularly; cameras and weaponry are not allowed. Even military pilots training in the NAFR risk disciplinary action if they stray into the exclusionary [...] "box" [...] surrounding Groom's airspace. Surveillance is supplemented using buried motion sensors. Area 51 is a common destination for Janet, the de facto name of a small fleet of passenger aircraft operated {{on behalf of the}} United States Air Force to transport military personnel, primarily from McCarran International Airport.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{ruled that}} the first two {{requirements}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> satisfied, and that the guideline <b>had</b> not <b>been</b> rigidly enforced because the PSA <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> consider representations from cruise operators like the plaintiff, and, if the circumstances required, the PSA <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> grant {{an exception to the}} 30% restriction rule. Moreover, a number of concessions <b>had</b> in fact <b>been</b> made by the PSA.|$|R

60|$|Q. How {{if a man}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> {{lose all}} that he hath, but is not now, will not God accept of his {{willingness}} in time past, though he be otherwise now?--A. No; for the true disciple must deny himself daily, take up his cross daily, and go after Jesus Christ (Luke 9:23).|$|E
60|$|The reinsurer, the optimist of ill-luck and disaster, slaps {{his pocket}} with satisfaction. The underwriter, {{who had been}} trying to {{minimize}} the amount of impending loss, regrets his premature pessimism. The ship has been stauncher, the skies more merciful, the seas less angry, or perhaps the men on board of a finer temper than he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take for granted.|$|E

[...] "The fact that your wife <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> return here to you, whilst still subject to that hallucination, is {{a view of the}} matter which I can neither discuss nor understand. I am here to-night, though, to lay a charge upon you.

60|$|One very {{important}} {{result of the}} Washington Conference is the agreement not to fortify islands in the Pacific, with certain specified exceptions. This agreement, if it is adhered to, will make war between America and Japan very difficult, unless we were allied with America. Without a naval base somewhere near Japan, America could hardly bring naval force {{to bear on the}} Japanese Navy. It had been the intention of the Navy Department to fortify Guam with a view to turning it into a first-class naval base. The fact that America <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> forgo this intention must be taken as evidence of a genuine desire to preserve the peace with Japan.|$|E

50|$|A 2013 {{article in}} the Los Angeles Times said that Alan Waxman, the chief of nuclear {{medicine}} at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> collaborate with Tobinick on a study that evaluated brain scans following etanercept injections for Alzheimer's disease. The article said that the widower of a woman Tobinick had treated for five years before her 2011 death <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay the $60,000 required to fund the study. Tobinick refused {{to participate in the}} study. He cited scientific inadequacies of the proposed study and said that he wanted to study the drug in stroke patients instead.|$|R
6000|$|What the Letters of Vetus treated of I do not know; doubtless {{they ran}} upon Napoleon, Catholic Emancipation, true methods of {{national}} defence, of effective foreign Anti-gallicism, and of domestic ditto; which formed the staple of editorial speculation at that time. I have heard in general that Captain Sterling, then and afterwards, advocated [...] "the Marquis of Wellesley's policy;" [...] but that also, what it was, I have forgotten, {{and the world}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> forget. Enough, {{the heads of the}} Times establishment, perhaps already the Marquis of Wellesley and other important persons, had their eye on this writer; and it began to be surmised by him that here at last was the career he had been seeking.|$|E

If it be as you say, {{he will have}} shown himself noble, and his nobility will have {{consisted}} in this, that he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take that which he does not want, in order that he may succour one whom he loves. I also will succour one whom I love, as best I know how." [...] Then she walked on quickly before her friend, and Lily {{stood for a moment}} thinking before she followed her. They were now on a field-path, by which they were enabled to escape the road back to Allington for the greater part of the distance, and Grace had reached a stile, and had clambered over it before Lily had caught her.|$|E

He began with nothing; he had neither blood nor money; and God knows he had no social merits to recommend him. He is as vulgar as a hog, as awkward as an elephant, and as ugly as an ape. I believe he never had a friend, and was known at his club to be the greatest bore that ever came out of Scotland; and yet for thirteen years he has lived on the fat of the land; for five years he has been in Parliament, his wife has gone about in her carriage, and every man in the city <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> shake hands with him.' ...|$|E

What passed between us I need not mention. I took up my botanizing case and hurried away along the cliffs, and afterward was met by Mr. Thurwell's servant, with whom I returned once more to look upon my work. Then came the time when suspicion commenced to fall upon my son. I implored him to leave the country. He refused. At last he was arrested. For the father whom he can only despise he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> die. To-night I had made up my mind to leave a confession of my guilt and fly. My plans are changed. Only a few hours ago I looked into the face of one whom I had never thought to see again in this world. Her advice I am now following. To her care I entrusted my confession, and to your ears I have detailed it. My story is done, gentlemen. Sir Philip Roden, I place myself in your hands." ...|$|E
60|$|But the {{arguments}} {{on the other}} side are equally cogent, and so much more alluring! And they are used by the same man with reference to the same passion, and are intended by him to put himself right in his conduct in reference to the same dear girl. Only the former line of thoughts occurred to him on a Saturday, when he was ending his week rather gloomily, and this other way of thinking on the same subject has come upon him on a Monday, as he is beginning his week with renewed hope. Does this young girl of his heart love him? And if so, their affection for each other being thus reciprocal, is she not entitled to an expression of her opinion and her wishes on this difficult subject? And if she be willing to run the risk and to encounter the dangers,--to do so on his behalf, because she is willing to share everything with him,--is it becoming in him, a man, to fear what she does not fear? If she be not willing let her say so. If there be any speaking, he must speak first;--but she is entitled, as much as he is, to her own ideas respecting their great outlook into the affairs of the world. And then is it not manifestly God's ordinance that a man should live together with a woman? How poor a creature does the man become who has shirked his duty in this respect, who has done nothing to keep the world going, who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> ignore all affection so that he might avoid all burdens, and who has put into his own belly every good thing that has come to him, either by the earning of his own hands or from the bounty and industry of others! Of course there is a risk; but what excitement is there in anything in which there is none? So on the Tuesday he speaks his mind to the young lady, and tells her candidly that there will be potatoes for the two of them,--sufficient, as he hopes, of potatoes, but no more. As a matter of course the young lady replies that she for her part will be quite content to take the parings for her own eating. Then they rush deliciously into each other's arms and the matter is settled. For, though the convictions arising from the former line of argument may be set aside as often as need be, those reached from the latter are generally conclusive. That such a settlement will always be better for the young gentleman and the young lady concerned than one founded on a sterner prudence is more than one may dare to say; but we do feel sure that that country will be most prosperous in which such leaps in the dark are made with the greatest freedom.|$|E
