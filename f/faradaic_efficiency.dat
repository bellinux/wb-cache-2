Ru was sys-tematically chosen because of its previously demonstrated catalytic activity at lower tem-peratures (~I 00 ~ for promoting the gas phase conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 (3).

It is of interest to note that CO 2 reduction to formic acid at amal-gamated Cu electrodes in aqueous Na 2 SO 4 has been shown(6) to occur with 18 % Faradaic effi-ciency and increase to 80 % upon addition of NaHCO 3 to the electrolyte.

50|$|One of the {{greatest}} drawbacks to galvanic cells, like fuel cells and various forms of electrolytic cells, {{is that they can}} suffer from high activation barriers. The energy diverted to overcome these activation barriers is transformed into heat. In most exothermic combustion reactions this heat would simply propagate the reaction catalytically. In a redox reaction, this heat is a useless byproduct lost to the system. The extra energy required to overcome kinetic barriers is usually described in terms of low <b>faradaic</b> <b>efficiency</b> and high overpotentials.

50|$|Faradaic losses {{describe}} the efficiency losses that are correlated to the current, that is supplied without leading to hydrogen at the cathodic gas outlet. The produced {{hydrogen and oxygen}} can permeate across the membrane, referred to as crossover. Mixtures of both gases at the electrodes result. At the cathode, oxygen can be catalytically reacted with hydrogen on the platinum surface of the cathodic catalyst. At the anode, hydrogen and oxygen do not react at the iridium oxide catalyst. Thus, safety hazards due to explosive anodic mixtures hydrogen in oxygen can result. The supplied energy for the hydrogen production is lost, when hydrogen is lost due to the reaction with oxygen at the cathode and permeation from the cathode across the membrane to the anode corresponds. Hence, {{the ratio of the}} amount of lost and produced hydrogen determines the faradaic losses. At pressurized operation of the electrolyzer the crossover and the correlated <b>faradaic</b> <b>efficiency</b> losses increase.|$|E

The main challenges include high cell overpotentials, low <b>faradaic</b> <b>efficiency,</b> low current densities, and electrocatalyst deactivation [78]. Because the thermodynamic potential for CO 2 reduction is similar to that of water splitting (1.23  V), the process results in low <b>faradaic</b> <b>efficiency,</b> given the competition to generate hydrogen.

In this study, we combined electrochemical methods, electron microscopy and Fe measurements to systematically examine the interdependent effects of current density (i), anodic interface potential (EA) and solution chemistry on the <b>Faradaic</b> <b>efficiency.</b> We found that Fe(0) oxidation was favored (<b>Faradaic</b> <b>efficiency</b> > 0. 85) in chloride and bromide solutions at all i, whereas carbonate, phosphate, citrate, and nitrate solutions lead to Faradaic efficiencies < 0. 1. The anodic reaction (i. e. Fe(0) oxidation or O 2 evolution) only depended on i in the sulfate and formate solutions. Experiments in binary-anion solutions revealed that molar ratios of [HCO 3 −]/[Cl−] near 100 and [NO 3 −]/[Cl−] near 20 separated the electrochemical domains of Fe(0) oxidation and O 2 evolution in the EC system.

Highest formic concentration (2.6  mM) and highest <b>faradaic</b> <b>efficiency</b> (15  %) was also attained at pH 3.87.

At pH 3.87, it was also interesting to detect formic acid at low overpotential (0.65  V vs. RHE) and achieve significant <b>faradaic</b> <b>efficiency,</b> since HPLC results in Fig.  4 show almost no formic acid formation. This difference between HPLC-coupled voltammetry and HPLC-coupled electrolysis indicates that formic acid production is affected by the electrolysis time which maybe due to the possible copper dissolution and complexation with P 4 VP in the acidic environment [34].|$|E

40|$|Electrolysis {{of molten}} copper (I) sulfide (Cu 2 S) in a sulfide-based {{electrolyte}} {{is being investigated}} {{for use as a}} direct path for copper extraction to replace the conventional process of smelting and electrorefining [1]. The allure of an electrolysis process for metals extraction can be enhanced by increasing its <b>faradaic</b> <b>efficiency,</b> through, for example, decreasing the electronic transference number of the electrolyte. This thesis compares two methods of determining the electronic transference number in Cu 2 S - barium sulfide (BaS) electrolytes to determine whether one or both methods are wellsuited for use with these high-temperature electrolytes. The first method is a stepped potential chronoamperometry method, in which the electronic transference number is determined from the decay of the current after a voltage step. The second method is a <b>faradaic</b> <b>efficiency</b> method, where the ionic transference number is determined from the efficiency with which ions can be transported from one electrode to the other. The stepped potential chronoamperometry method estimates electronic transference numbers between 0. 73 and 0. 85, while the <b>faradaic</b> <b>efficiency</b> method estimates values between 0. 12 and 0. 34 for the same electrolyte. Three differences between the experiments are investigated: (1) the work functions of the electrodes used, (2) the additional alloying driving force in <b>faradaic</b> <b>efficiency</b> experiments, and (3) the tin impurities in the electrolyte. This analysis suggests that the difference between the work function of the electrode and the electron affinity of the electrolyte may be the dominant cause of the experimental discrepancy. Therefore, it is suggested that electrodes and electrolytes be chosen to maximize this difference to enhance the <b>faradaic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of copper extraction from Cu 2 S.

A two-step mechanism is suggested for the ZrQ formation: generation of hydroxyl ions (OH) at the cathodic substrate by reduction of NO ~ and dissolved O 2, and then reaction of the hydroxyl ions with zirconyl ions present in the solution to form the hydroxide Zr(OH) 4, which in turn decomposes on drying to yield zirconia (ZrQ). <b>Faradaic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of 20 - 50 % were found, attributable to reduction reactions that do not produce hydroxyl ions, {{as well as to}} formation of the hydroxide at sites removed from the cathodic substrate due to diffusion of the hydroxyl ions. The effects of current density, time, and hydrodynamic conditions on coating weight, cell voltage, temperature, and pH of the solution were studied. Ceramic coatings are currently of much interest for ap-plications in high-temperature and severely corrosive en-vironments. A variety of methods are available for their production, including plasma spraying (1, 2), chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and sputtering (1), and sol-gel pro-cesses (3 - 5).
