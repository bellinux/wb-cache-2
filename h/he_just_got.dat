Regarding the artwork, Frusciante noted: [...] "My girlfriend's father offered to do the album art, so we sent him rough mixes of eight songs, and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> the vibe of the album from that. He said that he wouldn't be offended if we didn't like it, but we loved what he did. He's also given us great covers for all the singles. He's a true artist." ...|$|E

Earnhardt was quick to forgive him for the last-lap accident: [...] "He didn't wreck anyone on purpose. He was trying to push the 48. I don't think he thought, 'Oh, here's my chance to knock them both out.' <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> excited trying to push the 48." [...] Johnson was less sanguine: [...] "We had a great chance to make up some points and got crashed by a teammate... I was real patient until the white flag was up. I got a good run inside the 8 and got a lot of help from behind — too much help... Knowing the situation we're all in, I would hope someone would be a little more patient."

500|$|Back in Scranton, Jim and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) {{have been}} named the {{reluctant}} heads of the Party Planning Committee by Michael due to previous fights between Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) and Angela (Angela Kinsey). Jim and Dwight prove terrible at the job, especially when an upset Kelly (Mindy Kaling) chastises them for forgetting her birthday. They {{try to make it}} up to her by throwing a party but they do a poor job, choosing horrible decorations and forgetting Kelly's age. Dwight reads her file and learns Kelly spent time in juvenile hall, but is disappointed to learn it does not affect her job performance. Meanwhile, Andy (Ed Helms) finds himself attracted to Julia, a female potential client who is talking with Stanley (Leslie David Baker). Andy repeatedly acts awkwardly in front of Julia, and accidentally sets off her car alarm while trying to look inside and find out what music she likes. Andy admits his attraction to her to Stanley, who then gives the potential client over to Andy in exchange for two of his clients. [...] After walking her out to the car, Andy tries to kiss her, but is immediately rebuked. Andy apologizes and mentions that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> out of a relationship. The client claims she also just got out of a relationship and Andy starts feeling a connection, but she still rejects him and he loses the account.|$|E
500|$|During the 2003–04 season, {{his fourth}} with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting {{for a record}} five teams in a single campaign. After being named player of the tournament in four {{international}} pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games. Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French Winger Ludovic Giuly explained how a teenage Leo caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: [...] "He destroyed us all... They were kicking him {{all over the place}} to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien." [...] At 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, he made his first team debut when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against José Mourinho's Porto on 16 November 2003. His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team. After his first training session with the senior squad, Barça's new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself. Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi, whom he called [...] "little brother", which greatly eased his transition into the first team.|$|E

500|$|The New York {{magazine}} {{said that}} the film's premise of four high-school friends videotaping their senior year [...] "sounds like a fluffy reality show"; Bill Weber of Slant Magazine said, [...] "putting the trials of MTV reality-show prima donnas in perspective, the middle-class quartet will be relatable to this BBC/HBO production's audience in their easy embrace of Western kid stuff ... Directors Ivan O'Mahoney and Laura Winter balance [...] an everyday sense of the adolescents' wartime anxiety with the more commonplace juvenile relief." [...] Similarly, The Huffington Post raised comparisons with MTV reality shows, but {{was pleased to see}} that the Iraqi boys did not play to the cameras because they had not been exposed to programmes such as [...] or The Paper. That juvenile relief was commented on by many; The Washington Post highlighted Mohammad's adoption of an unwelcome mouse in the house. Hale described a scene where Mohammad and Ali act like hostage and captor. [...] "Suddenly Ali is holding a large knife. 'He's being naughty!' Mohammad says. Ali holds the knife near Mohammad and says, a little too unemotionally: 'Allah! This is the first hostage. I'm going to slaughter him this way.' Mohammad tells him to stop fooling around. Ali relents. 'O.K. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> a presidential pardon. He can live'." [...] Reuters also commented on this, and more banter between Ali and Mohammad. [...] "Ali is shown making a pretend hostage video with Mohammad, and then teasing his friend for his smelly feet.

He later appears in another episode when Bob interacts with Manny from Handy Manny after they get into a fender bender and get into an {{argument}} with Bob saying [...] "Stop copying my show!" [...] He leaves then someone tells Manny <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> built.

In the episode, Andrew W.K. of Destroy Build Destroy, is portrayed as being a jerk towards Bob. Andrew destroys everything Bob builds. In the end, Bob transforms his construction vehicles into Build-Tron (a parody of Voltron).

2500|$|Children of Bodom's {{first world}} tour began in 2003 and lasted until late 2004. The tour had many sold-out concerts and marked the {{consolidation}} of the band in North America, but was also accompanied by an unexpected announcement: Kuoppala decided to quit Children of Bodom for personal reasons {{right in the middle}} of the tour without giving previous warning. In an interview, when Laiho was asked why Kuoppala left the band, he stated that, [...] "Well, I try to be careful about what I say about him because there is no bad blood between us. He told me that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> sick of touring and the whole band/rock 'n roll lifestyle living in hotels and tour buses and stuff. For me it was really weird because he was always the one who was SO into it! He was a die hard rock 'n roller and suddenly he made a quick 180 turn in his whole life. This whole situation involves a new girlfriend." [...] Griffin's guitarist Kai Nergaard was invited by Laiho to replace Kuoppala, but did not accept the offer. Thus, Alexi's bandmate from Sinergy, Roope Latvala (founding member of Stone, one of the bands which started the heavy metal movement in Finland) assumed the guitars as a session player, until a more permanent solution could be found. This formation was introduced in Moscow on 16 August.|$|E

2500|$|Whenever {{shooting}} {{was taking place}} there was pressure on everyone involved, but the cast had a positive experience.

[...] Because of this, Stone said the director {{was able to get}} the best out of the cast, saying [...] " [...] creates this sort of fury in you, and then you end up realizing that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> so much out of you that you didn't even know you had". Naomi Watts commented that the atmosphere [...] "felt emblematic of how it feels onstageat least my long-time memories from long ago". Andrea Riseborough, meanwhile, described the process as [...] "wonderful", mentioning how it was possible to hear the filming of a sequence from far away before the camera arrived and then [...] "the magic happens with you, and then everything leaves you, and everything's silent". Once they successfully completed a take though, it was obvious to everybody involved.
