40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the most important}} research findings {{on the issue of}} lifelong learning strategy in Russia and some economically developed countries of the world. The term lifelong learning is not new. In the Soviet Union there were schools of extended studies for top officials and specialists, and <b>in-plant</b> <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> for workers. In the USA, as well as in Great Britain, France, Germany and some other countries qualified workers are trained within the system of two, five or even more year’s apprenticeship. There is also a net of national, public and private schools and <b>in-plant</b> <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> for adults. Russian educators mean education level continuation (from basic through secondary to higher vocational education), when talking about lifelong learning. The 2020 Long-term Social and Economic Development Strategy of the Russian Federation demands development of the high-tech sector of economy, alongside with creation of high-tech working places for new skilled specialists. Qualified specialists might be trained through the new programs of applied baccalaureate that guarantee practice-based training. A model of an integrated practice-based applied baccalaureate training program, which is currently being realized at Yurga Institute of Technology (affiliated) National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University, is specified. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Physicians require {{specific}} communication skills, {{because the}} face-to-face {{contact with their}} patients is {{an important source of}} information. Although physicians who perform work disability assessments attend some communication-related <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> during their professional education, no specialised and evidence-based communication skills <b>training</b> <b>course</b> is available for them. Therefore, the objectives of this study were: 1) to systematically develop a <b>training</b> <b>course</b> aimed at improving the communication skills of physicians during work disability assessment interviews with disability claimants, and 2) to plan an evaluation of the <b>training</b> <b>course.</b> Methods A physician-tailored communication skills <b>training</b> <b>course</b> was developed, according to the six steps of the Intervention Mapping protocol. Data were collected from questionnaire studies among physicians and claimants, a focus group study among physicians, a systematic review of the literature, and meetings with various experts. Determinants and performance objectives were formulated. A concept version of the <b>training</b> <b>course</b> was discussed with several experts before the final <b>training</b> <b>course</b> programme was established. The evaluation plan was developed by consulting experts, social insurance physicians, researchers, and policy-makers, and discussing with them the options for evaluation. Results A two-day post-graduate communication skills <b>training</b> <b>course</b> was developed, aimed at improving professional communication during work disability assessment interviews. Special focus was on active teaching strategies, such as practising the skills in role-play. An adoption and implementation plan was formulated, in which the infrastructure of the educational department of the institute that employs the physicians was utilised. Improvement in the skills and knowledge of the physicians who will participate in the <b>training</b> <b>course</b> will be evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. Conclusions The feasibility and practical relevance of the communication skills <b>training</b> <b>course</b> that was developed seem promising. Such a course may be relevant for physicians in many countries who perform work disability assessments. The development of the first <b>training</b> <b>course</b> of this type represents an important advancement in this field. </p...|$|R
