2500|$|The 2004 {{renovation}} of the infield, headed by design firm HNTB, {{was the first major}} {{renovation of}} the infield {{in the history of the}} track. In addition to the fanzone, a new vehicle and pedestrian tunnel was built under turn 1. [...] The tunnel posed a challenge to engineers because it was to be built under the water table. Another challenge came during construction when three named hurricanes passed by the track, flooding much of the excavation work. The infield renovation involved landscaping and hardscaping, such as a new walkway along the shore of Lake Lloyd, and the construction of 34 new buildings, including garages and fueling stations, offices and <b>inspection</b> <b>facilities,</b> and a club. The renovation project received a 2005 Award for Excellence from Design-Build Institute of America. Following the success of the UNOH Fanzone at Daytona, Las Vegas Motor Speedway and Kansas Speedway each built a similar infield fanzone. On December 9, 2016, the speedway announced that the University of Northwestern Ohio purchased entitlement rights to the fanzone, and that the area will be named 'UNOH Fanzone'.|$|E
