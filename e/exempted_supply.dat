40|$|The {{treatment}} of financial services under the VAT {{has been one}} of the most contentious VAT issues since the origin of the VAT. Due to theoretical and measurement complexities, most countries opt to exempt financial services under the VAT. Exemption is the cause of all the controversy. <b>Exempting</b> <b>supplies</b> under the VAT compromises one of the corner-stones of the VAT – neutrality. South Africa is one of many countries that exempts most financial services under VAT. Credit card suppliers in South Africa offer a bundle of financial services comprising fee-based-charges and interest earned. The credit card user is usually only charged for the interest. Interest is an <b>exempt</b> <b>supply</b> under VAT. This gives rise to many distortions for South African credit card users and financial intermediaries. Exhaustive research has been conducted on the {{treatment of}} financial services under the VAT around the world. This study only focusses on the VAT treatment of interest margins of credit cards in South Africa. Firstly, it was determined that credit card offerings in South Africa include bundled offerings which is impractical to separate on a transaction-for-for transaction-basis due to valuation complexities and market conditions. Secondly, it was determined that VAT doesn’t play a major role in credit card suppliers’ decision on how offerings are structured. It is mostly guided by the competition and legislation. Thirdly, it was determined that administrative burden and compliance cost caused by apportionment in South Africa is highly underplayed in the literature. Lastly, it was proposed that full taxation of all financial services with implicit charges at a lower rate or full taxation of fee-based charges with exemption of financial services with a partial input recovery, to be the best alternatives for South Africa to consider to tax financial services under VAT.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of Goods and Services Tax (GST) is often attributed {{as the main}} cause of the rising prices of goods and services. The main objective {{of this study is to}} estimate the extent of GST implementation impact on the costs of production, which in turn have implication on households' living costs. To achieve these objectives, the input-output price model is developed with modifications to take into account three different tax categories namely standard-rated supplies, zero-rated <b>supplies</b> and <b>exempt</b> <b>supplies.</b> The study finds that the {{implementation of}} the GST tends to benefit the economy. GST has the potential to reduce the prices of goods and services by 7. 4 % compared to only 2. 0 % expected price increase. The impact of this 5. 4 % price reduction not only increases the purchasing power of household but also has the potential to narrow the consumption gap between ethnic groups and income classes.

40|$|GST is a {{substantial}} revenue raiser for New Zealand. It has been internationally acclaimed and adopted by other countries. The framework for the tax is prescribed by the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the Act”). Under the Act, GST is charged on a supply {{of goods and services}} made in New Zealand on or after 1 October 1986 by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity which is not an <b>exempt</b> <b>supply.</b> 2 Given the fiscal significance of GST, the Act is a significant piece of legislation. How is this significant legislation to be read and applied? This paper interprets some of the leading court decisions. It is, of course, the role of the courts to interpret and apply the Act. The higher the court the more authoritative the decision, and the more likely its reasoning is to be applied in subsequent cases. The decisions of the highest court – the Privy Council and, more recently, the Supreme Court – should therefore be accorded great weight when interpreting GST law. The paper therefore analyses threshold decisions of the Privy Council and the Supreme Court on the Act...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{alternatives to}} the exempt VAT treatment of public bodies, non-profit organizations and charitable organizations (public service bodies). It focuses in particular on the Canadian VAT (the federal Goods and Services Tax) and its treatment of transactions involving public service bodies, including government to government transactions. Under the Canadian Goods and Services Tax rebate system, most supplies made by public service bodies are exempt but such bodies may claim a rebate for GST paid on purchases made to render such supplies. The rebate schedule is flexible and rebate rates may {{vary according to the}} nature of the activities and jurisdiction of operation (in the case of subnational VATs such as the Harmonized Sales Tax). The Canadian system therefore provides some compensation for VAT paid in purchases made in the course of providing <b>exempt</b> <b>supplies</b> and mitigates some of the inefficiencies and distributional impacts of a blanket exemption. Tax expenditure data for Canada suggest that this support is important. When compared to alternatives to exemption, the Canadian system lies between the extremes of the New Zealand and EU models. In New Zealand, nearly all transactions involving public service bodies are subject to VAT in the normal way, whereas nearly all such transactions are exempt in the EU, subject to an array of complex rules. The paper closes by arguing that the Canadian rebate system is more efficient and predictable than the EU system and should be given serious consideration as an alternative to that system, assuming that applying a New Zealand-style solution in the EU is far too radical a reform to contemplate...|$|R

40|$|As VAT {{becomes an}} {{increasingly}} important source of tax revenue world-wide, tax policy makers should be well aware of its strengths and weaknesses. In academia, there is strong consensus that tax exemptions rank among the most problematic features of VAT. The very concept of exemption is already a misrepresentation, because it normally entails the loss of entitlement to an input VAT credit; <b>exempt</b> <b>supplies</b> are therefore actually “input-taxed”. It is generally accepted that this particular form of occult taxation detrimentally affects economic efficiency and increases administrative complexity. Moreover, VAT as an indirect and impersonal tax on consumption {{is intended to be}} borne by final consumers but it is imposed on business. It will therefore often be questionable who really benefits from the intended relief, and whether there are superior alternatives to VAT exemptions to attain their underlying policy objectives. Even where they can be defended, exemptions are often implemented in an inconsistent fashion. All of these aspects are particularly troublesome in the EU VAT system that suffers from legislative eurosclerosis. The present paper discusses these topics with special emphasis on the EU constitutional and institutional framework. It offers an overview of the current array of exemptions and lays out the relevant economic and legal benchmark for their critical assessment. The paper identifies eight main rationales for tax exemptions and analyzes their merits in the light of those benchmarks. Particular attention is given to considerations of tax equity and social policy, and to exemptions of so-called “hard to tax”-supplies. In a separate section, the paper discusses the detrimental effects of the corresponding denial of input VAT deduction and its eventual justifications. Policy makers are thus provided with clear legal guidance as to which exemptions are required, which are tolerable, and which should be abolished within the framework of EU VAT, and how the defendable ones should be amended. ...|$|R
40|$|Apportionment {{of input}} VAT and the {{mechanisms}} {{used to calculate}} apportionment have been a challenging issue {{since the inception of}} the Value-Added Tax Act No. 89 of 1991 in South Africa. This requirement to apportion input VAT has particular relevance to the retail industry due to the increase in the extension of credit which results in the receipt of taxable supplies (ordinary sales) and <b>exempt</b> <b>supplies</b> (interest income). As retailers are therefore making mixed supplies, they are required to apportion the input VAT paid on expenses. At present the standard method for input VAT apportionment in South Africa is the turnover basis however this method is not perceived as equitable by credit retailers. After an in-depth analysis of the retail industry in South Africa, its relevance to the South African economy and the impact of the requirement to apportion input VAT using the turnover method on listed companies within the South African retail industry, this paper analyses the treatment of VAT apportionment by the South African Revenue Service {{within the context of the}} Value-Added Tax Act No. 89 of 1991 and relevant South African case law. Recommendations for South Africa are then sought by studying the mechanisms for input VAT apportionment used in countries with VAT systems similar to that of South Africa. Included in this study are those countries which employ traditional VAT systems such as European Union member states and Mexico; and those countries which have implemented modern VAT systems such as New Zealand, Singapore, Australia and Canada. In addition, alternative approaches to address the root cause of the requirement to apportion input VAT used internationally are researched to the extent that these mechanisms have application to the retail industry in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|The general mindset of most vendors {{is that if}} {{they have}} a valid tax invoice, they can claim all their input VAT. They are, however, not aware of the {{requirements}} of section 17 (1) of the Value-Added Tax Act. Section 17 (1) explains that vendors cannot claim all their input tax if their expense relates to both taxable and non-taxable supplies and that, consequently, input tax need to be apportioned in some or other way. There are several methods of apportionment available to vendors of which the turnover-based method is the only approved method by the South African Revenue Service (SARS) for which no ruling is necessary. This study investigates the most common methods used by vendors, how these methods function and also under which circumstances these methods are recommended. The sectors that are influenced the most by this provision in the Value-Added Tax Act are banks, universities and municipalities. These sectors have large amounts of <b>exempt</b> <b>supplies</b> but also taxable supplies with expenses incurred that cannot be allocated specifically to a certain income. Therefore, a method of apportionment should be used to allocate the input VAT. Information was obtained through financial reports and questionnaires from 29 entities in South Africa. The information was used to calculate an average percentage of apportionment in each sector and also to establish which method of apportionment is the most commonly used method of apportionment in each sector. The conclusion was drawn that there might, under certain circumstances, be uncertainty on whether some income should be included or excluded in the apportionment calculation. Under these circumstances, it is recommended that a ruling should be obtained from SARS to avoid problems in the future. CopyrightDissertation (MCom) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|Statistics {{demonstrate}} {{the diversity of}} EC agriculture. Agriculture in southern Europe is characterized by many small farms, most of which emphasize crop production. In northern Europe, farms are larger {{and more likely to}} emphasize livestock production. More than 70 percent of all EC farms are in southern Europe, but northern Europe accounts for more than 60 percent of all agricultural production and public expenditures on agriculture. The proposed Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform would reduce agricultural support prices and impose additional supply control measures. Small-scale producers would be <b>exempt</b> from <b>supply</b> control provisions and would receive direct payments to compensate for reduced market returns. Large-scale producers would receive compensation payments on only a portion of their production. Given the distribution of land and livestock in the European Community, less than 10 percent of all farms are too large to receive full compensation, but these farms account for approximately 50 percent of all crop acreage and 40 percent of dairy and beef animals. These large farms are concentrated in northern Europe, which helps explain the opposition of several northern European agricultural ministers to the reform proposal. ...|$|R
40|$|If a {{value-added}} tax (VAT) {{were chosen to}} supplement or replace some portion of the revenue from the income tax, a choice would likely be made between the credit-invoice method and the subtraction-method for calculating VAT liability. Credit-invoice method VATs and subtraction-method VATs are, at a conceptual level, very similar taxes. The key substantive difference between most subtraction-method VAT proposals and extant credit-invoice method VATs is that subtraction-method VAT proposals generally do not impose an invoice requirement. The invoice requirement substantially reduces tax avoidance opportunities in the VAT, and also ensures the ability to provide appropriate treatment for exports while remaining consistent with international trade obligations under the World Trade Organization (WTO). Further, the perceived difference between the subtraction-method VAT, as a tax on an entity, and the credit-invoice method VAT, as a tax on specific goods could affect policy decisions with respect to important design features. The relevant design features include whether to <b>exempt</b> certain <b>supplies</b> of goods or services by certain entities, whether to tax supplies of some goods or services at lower rates, the taxation of nonprofit organizations, state and local government, real estate, financial services, and small business, and how to treat imports, exports, and negative taxable value-added. On balance, credit-invoice method VATs seem more likely than subtraction-method VATs to be adopted with VAT design best practices...|$|R
50|$|The Brighton General Gas Light Company {{was formed}} in 1825. Although {{production}} of coal gas was notorious for the smell it produced, the company acquired land in the fields between Hove Street and St. Andrew's Church, and in 1832 built a gasworks on a two-acre site. The process required substantial tonnage of coal, delivered by horse-drawn cart on the unmade tracks in the vicinity, and removal of by-products including coke, coal tar, sulphur and ammonia. An industrial site such as this, with a tall chimney and two gasometers next to the churchyard was a considerable intrusion on the populace of Hove, but not for still-distant and rapidly growing Brighton, the main centre of consumption. Being situated in Hove it avoided the duty of £1 per 8 tons levied on coal by the Brighton Town Act of 1773. A gasworks built east of Brighton in 1819, and therefore similarly <b>exempt,</b> was <b>supplied</b> by sailing brigs grounding at high tide, the crew tipping the coal down chutes into horse-drawn carts then re-floating on the next tide. This method, inherently dirty and disruptive, would have been used at Hove until {{the arrival of the}} railway in 1840. By 1861 the site had doubled in size and there were now five gasometers, ranging in size from small to large. Due to spiralling demand a large new works was opened in Shoreham Harbour at Portslade-by-Sea in 1871, and by 1885 all gas manufacture in Brighton and Hove had been transferred there. The Hove site, in a by now primarily residential area, was then used for storage only.|$|R
25|$|The mid-13th century saw {{the start}} of the abbey's decline, with a {{succession}} of financial problems and scandals. In 1253, its creditors were prevented from seizing its flocks, if the debt could be settled by another means. In 1275, the abbey's debts were so great that its management was assigned to the Lord Chancellor and Bishop of Bath and Wells, Robert Burnell, and the following year it was placed under royal protection for two years. Edward I's war against Wales of 1282–83 drew heavily on Cheshire and placed additional strain on the monastery; it ran so low on food stores in 1283 that it was <b>exempted</b> from providing <b>supplies</b> for the army and once again removed from the abbot's management. Burnell contributed £213 towards the abbey's needs – a sum considerably in excess of its annual income, estimated in 1318 at £130 14s 11d – receiving lands in Monks Coppenhall (now Crewe) in return. Royal custody was renewed in 1315–21, from 1328, and again from 1412; the 15th-century custodians included Henry Beaufort, the Bishop of Winchester. The abbey's impoverished state persisted throughout the 14th and 15th centuries; in 1496, it was exempted from tax for this reason.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the unification or rather harmonization potential of European requirements concerning documentary evidences. These evidences are necessary to <b>exempt</b> intra-Community <b>supplies</b> from value-added tax (VAT). The analysis concerns not only the concrete differences in the national requirements but also the fulfillment of European and entrepreneurial conditions and the existence of potential best solutions. The results of the analysis are not only interesting for entrepreneurs but also for researches. The former ones benefit from this thesis as an overview of the differences is provided and along coming difficulties as additional efforts are studied. For the latter group this thesis contributes to research in general as no European-wide comparison is available and in particular as internationalization decisions are influenced or even affected by the design of documentary evidences in the respective EU Member States. Hence, the review of literature, the VAT Directive, Council Directives and decisions of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) provide a theoretical basis that shows the need for documentary evidences, the reason for the national differences and their potential design. Furthermore, this basis is used to establish a catalogue of criteria that includes the EU as the initiator of the requirements and the entrepreneur as the person responsible for fulfilling these requirements {{in order to be able}} to compare and analyze the national differences. The study of different national law texts and a survey aiming on the collection of further national requirements led to the comparison and analysis of 16 Member States. Hence, it was possible to conclude that the differences in the requirements on documentary evidences are partly striking but that a common requirement basis would be possible. This was also supported by the facts that none of the countries fulfills both the European and the entrepreneurial requirements and that no country provides a best solution. Therefore, a harmonization proposal is provided that takes also the national wish for sovereignty into account. This study is restricted by certain limitations concerning formal requirements, facilitating definitions, quality of data and ignorance of further factors. Anyhow, the results that were drawn are valid and important in the limits of this thesis. They do not only indicate that a basic harmonization of requirements on documentary evidences would be advantageous but also that further research potential is available and necessary.

40|$|EU VAT {{authorities}} {{are close to}} turning the tables on missing traders. For many years organized fraudsters have been stealing huge amounts of VAT on the domestic re-sale of <b>exempt</b> cross-border <b>supplies.</b> Losses have been enormous whether the transactions are in goods (notably cell phones and computer chips) or in tradable services (CO 2 permits and VoIP). No market has been safe from the fraudsters. Answers are developing, but these answers may look more like Armageddon than measured enforcement. Solutions are so draconian, and so all-encompassing that very few intra-community traders will feel safe from the gathering storm. The situation is not optimal, but {{it appears to be}} where we are headed. This paper discusses the alignment of (1) the joined cases of Axel Kittel v. Belgium and Belgium v. Recolta Recycling SPRL; (2) the Criminal Proceedings against R; and (3) the Council Directive 2010 / 24 /EU of 16 March 2010 concerning mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to taxes, duties, and other measures. A concluding section presents a series of six hypothetical fact patterns that apply these imperatives. In a nutshell, the argument presented through these hypotheticals is that Kittel is not for domestic-only application. Kittel responds just as effectively to multi-jurisdictional missing trader fact patterns as it does to domestic patterns. Secondly, it argues that “R” is an effective backstop to Kittel when tax authorities attack missing trader fraud across Community borders. Third, it argues that MARC provides sweeping cross-jurisdictional investigative assistance to any Member State that is pursuing recovery from a fraudster, or group of fraudsters. And finally, it argues that because Member States are under an affirmative obligation to pursue missing traders throughout the Community to protect the common system of VAT from assault by criminals, these tools are being readied for use in a wide-ranging wave of MTIC enforcement efforts throughout the Community. MARC’s enhanced investigative and enforcement powers allow/compel an easy flow of information, notification and protective measures among the member States. Multiple recoveries are a very distinct possibility. The EU VAT does not have a mechanism that assures one recovery, and neither the ECJ nor the judiciary of the member States seem anxious to find one. This may all be the result of the severity of the missing trader problem coming home to roost, but it is not good for legitimate business. Unfortunately we may witness a perfect storm. One cannot help but {{think that there is a}} better way forward...|$|R
