This study aimed to develop the first comprehensive description of the epidemiology of dialysis-treated ESKD in Libya. Methods Structured demographic and clinical data were obtained regarding all adult patients treated at all maintenance dialysis facilities (n= 39) in Libya from May to September 2009. Subsequently data were collected prospectively on all new patients who started dialysis from September 2009 to August 2010. Population estimates were obtained from the Libyan national statistics department. The age and <b>gender</b> <b>breakdown</b> of the population in each region was obtained from mid- 2009 population estimates based on 2006 census data. Results The prevalence of dialysis-treated ESKD was 624 per million population (pmp). 85 % of prevalent patients were aged Conclusions Libya has a relatively high prevalence and incidence of dialysis-treated ESKD. As the country prepares to redevelop its healthcare system it is hoped that these data will guide strategies for the prevention of CKD and planning for the provision of renal replacement therapy. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The study {{aimed to}} {{consider}} the value of nitrate prescriptions issued by general practices {{as an indicator of}} coronary heart disease and to compare this with the use of coronary heart disease registers. DESIGN: The study was a cross sectional survey. A self completed questionnaire was used by general practices to indicate an age and <b>gender</b> <b>breakdown</b> of the total practice population, the number of patients taking nitrates, and details of patients recorded on a coronary heart disease register. SUBJECTS: All 48 general practices registered with Wakefield Family Health Services Authority were sent a questionnaire. MAIN RESULTS: The prevalence of angina in the sample population of 164796 was 3. 1 %. The prevalence of angina as assessed by coronary heart disease registers was significantly higher at 4. 3 %. CONCLUSIONS: Using questionnaires to assess how many patients are taking nitrates and therefore have angina may provide a quick, "snapshot" view of the prevalence of angina but the methodology is not a robust epidemiological tool. It is likely to provide errors in estimates of true prevalence and risks some under estimation when compared with coronary heart disease registers...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. The aim of {{this study}} is to discuss {{personal}} and demographic factors that influence the relationship between physical activity and awareness of one's own body, as well as the pain response (threshold and tolerance of pain), situational anxiety and personality. In the study 38 healthy individual- volunteers, students in Trakia University - Stara Zagora were selected. All participants were divided into two groups: actively involved in individual or team sport (n = 19) and healthy normaly active subjects (non-athletes, n = 19). The age of the study participants ranged between 18 and 39 years, while the <b>gender</b> <b>breakdown</b> was as follows: men - 22 women – 16. Methods: Psychological Questionnaires: Body Awareness Questionnaire that asks subjects to rate, on a 4 point scale, the degree to which they were currently experiencing symptoms of sympathetic arousal, State Trait Anger Scale, and State Trait Anxiety Scale. Objective methods (cold pressure test) are used only to determine the pain sensation and pain tolerance thresholds. The results of investigation support significant differences between athletes and non-athletes in pain thershold, body awareness and anxiety.

40|$|As a concept, {{ecotourism}} sells both ‘authentic’ {{nature and}} ‘authentic’ local culture and experience. Ecotourism has long invited debate surrounding a standard {{definition of the}} term itself. Most definitions and descriptions of ecotourism do not directly mention authenticity. When connected to authenticity, ecotourism can be defined as the rarity of the experience, in natural and pristine global environments free from the plunder of human development. Unnaturalness and human interference are eschewed by ecotourists, who wish to avoid any visible exploitation. A survey of households in the Central Queensland region was undertaken as one part of a larger survey: the 2009 Central Queensland Social Survey. The sample of questionnaire respondents included 1, 273 persons, aged 18 years or older, who had experienced an ecotourism tour or holiday. The <b>gender</b> <b>breakdown</b> of respondents was 50. 2 percent male and 49. 8 percent female. Respondents were more favourable in their judgements of ecotourism if they had some previous ecotourism experiences. Women were more favourable towards ecotourism than men.

40|$|Our {{purpose in}} {{this paper is to}} show the {{circumstances}} and consequences of the extensive growth in employment in the Swiss financial sector that occurred in the 1980 s, which are to a large extent responsible for the current patterns of restructuring and dismissal in Swiss banks. Four study areas were chosen: Switzerland as a whole; the city of Zurich; its surrounding suburban regions; and one particular suburban region. All these areas are highly identified with the financial sector. First we evaluate the changes in numbers of employees between 1980 and 1990 and the <b>gender</b> <b>breakdown</b> within different occupational categories in the three study areas. The data for the analysis were gained from the Swiss censuses of 1980 and 1990. Second, we look at the circumstances that caused the suburbanisation of bank back-office functions and the impact on office employment, putting special emphasis on women occupied in clerical - secretarial work. The focus is on one suburban zone around Zurich which experienced the most noticeable growth in office employment of all suburban regions over the last two decades. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} the Swiss banks are a male bastion. Women are mainly found in the lower qualified occupations, such as clerical - secretarial work. Moreover, the suburban belt is characterised by a high percentage of women in pink-collar jobs whereas the city is dominated by male employees. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the relationship between gender and the individual and social aspects of expatriate work, emphasising how issues external to the organisation impact on the experience of female expatriates. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 102 male respondents and 44 female respondents were surveyed in order to test the perceived organisational support, career satisfaction, and expatriate social support. Findings – Significant gender-related differences were identified in all three areas with notable contradiction in the perception and practice of how multinational corporations (MNCs) manage their expatriates. While earlier research suggested that organisations perceived their treatment of female expatriates to be equivalent to that of men, the results indicate that female international managers do not perceive equal treatment on international assignments. Research limitations/implications – Although based on a smaller sample than other international studies, the <b>gender</b> <b>breakdown</b> was sufficient for moderated regression testing. Practical implications – As the expatriate social support construct is largely exploratory in nature, future research could examine the effect of perceived expatriate social support on other related workplace behaviours, both domestically and internationally, including work-life balance and diversity management. Originality/value – While other studies have provided a rich descriptive picture of the gendered nature of expatriation, little research has attempted to quantify the reasons behind the phenomenon...|$|R
