5|$|Silicon is {{a common}} {{impurity}} in diamond films grown by chemical vapor deposition and it originates either from silicon substrate or from silica windows or walls of the CVD reactor. It was also observed in natural diamonds in dispersed form. Isolated silicon defects have been detected in diamond lattice through the sharp optical absorption peak at 738nm and electron paramagnetic resonance. Similar to other large impurities, the major form of silicon in diamond has been identified with a Si-vacancy complex (semi-divacancy site). This center is a <b>deep</b> <b>donor</b> having an ionization energy of 2 eV, and thus again is unsuitable for electronic applications.|$|E

40|$|The red (1. 8 eV) {{photoluminescence}} (PL) band often {{observed in}} Mg-doped GaN {{has been suggested}} {{to be due to}} a recombination process involving vacancy-related deep defects. To identify the defects concerned, optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) experiments have been combined. A correlation between the PL spectra, the ODMR signals and the PAS data has been observed in as-grown layers as the magnesium doping level is increased. The experiments provide strong evidence that the origin of the red PL is recombination of electrons from both shallow and <b>deep</b> <b>donors</b> with holes at deep acceptors, the <b>deep</b> <b>donors</b> being complexes formed from nitrogen vacancies associated with substitutional magnesium ions and the deep acceptors being gallium vacancies or related center...|$|R

40|$|The {{decrease}} in the measured Hall free-electron concentration with decreasing temperature near 300 K is often observed for thin high-purity GaAs layers. This has previously been interpreted as electron freezeout on <b>deep</b> <b>donor</b> sites. However, it can be quantitatively described by the {{decrease in}} carrier concentration per unit area associated with increasing surface and interface depletion region thicknesses. It is shown that when these depletion regions {{are included in the}} analysis of the Hall-effect data, the measured free-electron freezeout behavior can be accurately described by a simple shallow donor. If necessary, a <b>deep</b> <b>donor</b> may be included in the modeling.

40|$|Deep level {{transient}} spectroscopy (DLTS) {{has been}} applied to study electron and hole traps in InPBi alloys with 2. 2 and 2. 4 % Bi grown by molecular beam epitaxy. One donor-like trap with the activation energy of 0. 45 - 0. 47 eV and one acceptor-like trap with activation energy of 0. 08 eV have been identified in DLTS measurements. For the reference sample (InP grown at the same temperature), the <b>deep</b> <b>donor</b> trap has also been observed, while the acceptor trap was not detected. According to the literature, the <b>deep</b> <b>donor</b> level found in InP(Bi) at 0. 45 - 0. 47 eV below the conduction band has been attributed to the isolated P-In defect, while the second trap, which is observed only for Bi containing samples at 0. 08 eV above the valence band can be attributed to Bi clusters in InPBi. This acceptor level was proposed to be responsible for the observed partial compensation of native free electron density in InPBi layers. It is also shown that the <b>deep</b> <b>donor</b> traps are active in photoluminescence (PL). A strong radiative recombination between donor traps and the valence band are observed in PL spectra at energy 0. 6 - 0. 8 eV, i. e. similar to 0. 47 eV below the energy gap of InPBi, which is determined by contactless electroreflectance...|$|E
40|$|Exchange {{interactions}} among defects in semiconductors are commonly treated within effective-mass theory using a scaled hydrogenic wave-function. However such a wave-function {{is only applicable}} to shallow impurities; here we present a simple but robust generalization to treat <b>deep</b> <b>donors,</b> in which we treat the long-range part of the wavefunction using the well established quantum defect theory, and include a model central-cell correction to fix the bound-state eigenvalue at the experimentally observed value. This allows us to compute the effect of binding energy on exchange interactions as a function of donor distance; this is a significant quantity given recent proposals to carry out quantum information processing using <b>deep</b> <b>donors.</b> As expected, exchange interactions are suppressed (or increased), compared to the hydrogenic case, by the greater localization (or delocalization) of the wavefunctions of <b>deep</b> <b>donors</b> (or `super-shallow' donors with binding energy less then the hydrogenic value). The calculated results are compared with a simple scaling of the Heitler-London hydrogenic exchange; the scaled hydrogenic results give the correct order of magnitude but fail to reproduce quantitatively our calculations. We calculate the donor exchange in silicon including inter-valley interference terms for donor pairs along the { 100 } direction, and also show the influence of the donor type on the distribution of nearest-neighbour exchange constants at different concentrations. Our methods can be used to compute the exchange interactions between two donor electrons with arbitrary binding energy. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figures, RevTeX...|$|R

We confirm the role of the <b>deep</b> <b>donor</b> as the dominant nonradiative recombination center, but we show here that the acceptor concentration is equally crucial for the determination of the carrier lifetime as the <b>deep</b> <b>donor</b> concentration. Using the number of acceptors as the only adjustable parameter in our model, we are able to simulate the carrier lifetime for the growth and annealing conditions used in our experiments and to reproduce all the characteristics of the carrier recombination dynamics in LT-GaAs, such as nonexponential transients and the influence of the illumination intensity.

40|$|The {{properties}} of thin film InVO 4 photoanodes for water splitting have been studied. Compact films of InVO 4 were prepared by spray pyrolysis and {{are found to}} be stable between pH 3 – 11. Although the indirect bandgap is 3. 2 eV, a modest amount of visible light absorption is observed. The origin of this absorption is attributed to the presence of <b>deep</b> <b>donor</b> states at ~ 0. 7 eV below the conduction band. Shallow donors are absent in this material, in contrast to what is normally observed for metal oxides. The <b>deep</b> <b>donor</b> model explains the much stronger visible light absorption of powders compared to thin films, and is supported by photoluminescence data.

The HSE 06 functional provides a realistic value for the band gap, which ensures a correct classification of dopants as shallow or <b>deep</b> <b>donors</b> or acceptors. Defect formation energies and thermodynamic transition levels are calculated {{taking into account the}} constraints imposed by the stability of TiO 2 and the solubility limit of the impurities. Nb, Ta, W and Mo are identified as shallow donors. Although W provides two electrons, Nb and Ta show a considerably lower formation energy, in particular under O-poor conditions. Mo donates in principle one electron, but under specific conditions can turn into a double donor. V impurities are <b>deep</b> <b>donors</b> and Cr shows up as an amphoteric defect, thereby acting as an electron trapping center in n-type TiO 2 especially under O-rich conditions.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of using deep level impurities to obtain 'semi-insulating' Czochralski silicon of near-intrinsic resistivity for microwave applications has been analysed.

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{mechanisms}} of drain current collapse and gate leakage currents in the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure field effect transistor (HFET), detailed electrical properties of the ungated portion and Schottky-gated portion of the device were investigated separately, using a gateless HFET structure and an AlGaN Schottky diode structure. The gateless device was subjected to plasma treatments and surface passivation processes including our novel Al 2 O 3 -based surface passivation. dc I–V curves of gateless HFETs were highly nonlinear due to virtual gating by surface states. After drain stress, air-exposed, H 2 plasma-treated and SiO 2 -deposited gateless HFETs showed an initial large-amplitude exponential current transient followed by a subsequent smaller, slow, and highly nonexponential response. The former was explained by emission from <b>deep</b> <b>donors</b> at Ec– 0. 37 eV, and the latter by emission from surface states. Capture transients with stress-dependent capture barriers were also observed. An x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study indicated that 0. 37 eV-deep donors are N-vacancy related. On the other hand, no current transients took place in N 2 plasma treated and Al 2 O 3 -passivated samples. Temperature dependences of I–V curves of Schottky diodes were extremely small and reverse currents were anomalously large. They were explained by the "thin surface barrier" (TSB) model where thermionic field emission and field emission through the TSB region formed by <b>deep</b> <b>donors</b> produce leakage current paths. By combining the results on gateless HFETs and Schottky diodes, a new unified model of near-surface electronic states for the free surface and Schottky interface of AlGaN is proposed. It consists of a U-shaped surface state continuum and N-vacancy related near-surface discrete <b>deep</b> <b>donors.</b> The model can explain the observed large gate leakage and drain current collapse in AlGaN/GaN HFETs in a unified way.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed serious deterioration such as stoichiometry disorder and nitrogen deficiency (N deficiency) at the AlGaN surfaces processed by high-temperature annealing, H 2 -plasma cleaning, dry etching in CH 4 /H 2 /Ar plasma and deposition of SiO 2.
