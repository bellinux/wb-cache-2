5000|$|Sir Humphrey meets {{for lunch}} with Sir Desmond Glazebrook, the Chairman of Bartlett's Bank, {{who happens to}} be an old friend. Sir Desmond is unsympathetic to Bradley's predicament but Sir Humphrey {{suggests}} that the bank takes over his part of the contract and goes into partnership with the government itself. However, Sir Desmond reminds him that it is up to his Board, and the outcome is far from certain. Changing the subject, Sir Desmond enquires if there are any chairmanships of quangos currently available. Sir Humphrey finds it difficult to think of a suitable position, as by Sir Desmond's own admission he is a banker and therefore knows [...] "nothing". Sir Humphrey vainly uses their restaurant location to inspire various commissions and authorities on which Sir Desmond might sit. This culminates in a steak being flambéed at the next table and suggesting the Fire Services Examination Board. Ultimately the only job that takes his interest is on a new <b>Industrial</b> <b>Co-Partnership</b> Commission, which is in Hacker's gift.|$|E
5000|$|Back in {{his office}} with Bernard, he tries to {{question}} Sir Humphrey on the matter, but is frustrated by {{not knowing what to}} ask. They are joined by Frank Weisel, Hacker's political advisor. He has prepared a paper on quangos, with the aim of taking all appointments away from ministers and handing them to a Select Committee instead. Hacker is enthusiastic and cites as a case for change the recent recommendation of the [...] "blithering idiot" [...] Sir Desmond Glazebrook for the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Co-Partnership</b> Commission. He refuses point blank to appoint him. Sir Humphrey begs him to reconsider and finally decides to show Hacker the Solihull report. The Minister is mortified by its contents and despatches Bernard to stop the BBC broadcast; however, he is too late. Sir Humphrey advises that all may be well if Bartlett's Bank agrees to take over the contract — but this is contingent on Sir Desmond Glazebrook getting his desired quango. Hacker now accepts the appointment with alacrity and furthermore, recommends that Joe Morgan be his deputy.|$|E
40|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>co-partnership</b> schemes have, in the British context, been {{previously}} presented in two ways. On the one hand, co-pa~~ership has {{been regarded as}} a labour policy practised by a significant minority of Victorian employers. This body of opinion also maintains that the policy did not {{attract the attention of}} government, indeed, it remained a purely extra-parliamentary issue. In contrast, co-partnership has also been interpreted as the product of enlightened government planning [...] a novel element of the reconstruction plans laid-down during the Great War. The primary concern of the present study if to demonstrate that co-partnership aroused considerable interest in parliamenta~J and government circles in the immediate pre-war period. The identification of a significant degree of official pre-war interest in co-partnership will, it is hoped, be of value in relation to at least two areas of research. Firstly the present study sheds some much-needed light on a crucial turning point in the relationship betwee...|$|E
40|$|William T. Thornton's {{contribution}} to developments in {{late nineteenth century}} political economy is generally associated with his criticism of John Stuart Mill's 'supply and demand' theory of value and his attack on Henry Fawcett's version of the wage fund doctrine. In a Fortnightly Review article (published in May and June 1869) on Thornton's book, On Labour, Mill publicly deferred to Thornton's criticism of the wage fund doctrine but did not accept his criticism {{of the theory of}} value. There is another aspect of Mill's review article, however, which historians of economic thought seem to have overlooked: his enthusiastic discussion of Thornton's treatment of trade union efficacy and <b>industrial</b> <b>co-partnership.</b> The question explored in this paper is whether Thornton's work on labour relations, trade union efficacy and cooperativism helped shape Mill's own thinking on these subjects during the 1860 s. We begin by documenting Thornton's views on trade unionism and then examine Mill's evolving sympathy toward trade unions-an important feature of his social reform program. It is sometimes claimed that nineteenth century economists tended to ignore the role played by trade unions in industrial society. This paper points out that Mill and Thornton, two leading economists {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century, did not oppose trade unions and were favourably impressed with the advantages for society of labour combinations. Nonetheless, they looked forward to the gradual supplanting of the system of collective bargaining by 'higher' cooperation. ...|$|E
