5000|$|Anger {{is defined}} in Buddhism as: [...] "being unable to bear the object, or the {{intention}} to cause harm to the object." [...] Anger is seen as aversion with a stronger exaggeration, and is listed {{as one of the}} five hindrances. Buddhist monks, such as Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetans in exile, sometimes get angry. However, there is a difference; most often a spiritual person is aware of the emotion and the way it can be handled. Thus, in response to the question: [...] "Is any anger acceptable in Buddhism?' the Dalai Lama answered: Buddhism in general teaches that anger is a destructive emotion and although anger might have some positive effects in terms of survival or moral outrage, I do not accept that anger of any kind as (sic) a virtuous emotion nor aggression as constructive behavior. The Gautama Buddha (sic) has taught that there are three basic kleshas at the root of samsara (bondage, illusion) and the vicious cycle of rebirth. These are greed, hatred, and delusion—also translatable as attachment, anger, and ignorance. They bring us confusion and misery rather than peace, happiness, and fulfillment. It is in our own self-interest to purify and transform them. Buddhist scholar and author Geshe Kelsang Gyatso has also explained Buddha's teaching on the spiritual imperative to identify anger and overcome it by transforming difficulties:When things go wrong in our life and we <b>encounter</b> <b>difficult</b> situations, we tend to regard the situation itself as our problem, but in reality whatever problems we experience come {{from the side of the}} mind. If we responded to difficult situations with a positive or peaceful mind they would not be problems for us. Eventually, we might even regard them as challenges or opportunities for growth and development. Problems arise only if we respond to difficulties with a negative state of mind. Therefore if we want to be free from problems, we must transform our mind.The Buddha himself on anger:An angry person is ugly & sleeps poorly. Gaining a profit, he turns it into a loss, having done damage with word & deed. A person overwhelmed with anger destroys his wealth. Maddened with anger, he destroys his status. Relatives, friends, & colleagues avoid him. Anger brings loss. Anger inflames the mind. He doesn't realize that his danger is born from within. An angry person doesn't know his own benefit. An angry person doesn't see the Dharma. A man conquered by anger is in a mass of darkness. He takes pleasure in bad deeds as if they were good, but later, when his anger is gone, he suffers as if burned with fire. He is spoiled, blotted out, like fire enveloped in smoke. When anger spreads, when a man becomes angry, he has no shame, no fear of evil, is not respectful in speech. For a person overcome with anger, nothing gives light.|$|E

30|$|Researchers {{indicate}} the explicit evidence on corporate foresight for companies and organizations still {{suffering from the}} lack of a framework to encounter future economic conditions as well as assuring all relevant external changes and providing proper responses. Many researchers have attempted to provide such framework for foresight.

Therefore, it is necessary to utilize foresight in corporations to <b>encounter</b> <b>difficult</b> future conditions, to forecast future trends, and to identify and interpret weak signals and entry into new markets. On the other hand, there are some barriers for the successful execution of foresight models such as future inaccessibility, changes in forecasts, contribution increases, keeping different insights, data collection, cost reduction, and needs for new methods. These barriers need to be taken into consideration to develop foresight capacities in organizations [27].|$|E

30|$|Second, we {{investigated}} the joint effect of person and item characteristics on disengagement using explanatory item response models. At the person level, {{we tested the}} effects of educational attainment, language, gender, age, and cognitive skill on individual test-taking disengagement in literacy, numeracy, and problem solving. Given previous research, we expected that educational attainment, fluency in the test language, being female and cognitive skill would be negatively related to test-taking disengagement. We had no hypothesis with regard to age. We further investigated how item characteristics affect disengagement. Given previous findings, we expected items completed {{in the second part}} of the PIAAC assessment to be associated with significantly greater disengagement than the same items completed in the first part. Furthermore, in accordance the informed disengagement hypothesis presented above, we assumed that disengagement would increase with item difficulty across all three domains. This effect was hypothesized to be moderated by individual cognitive skill such that the negative effect of item difficulty on disengagement would be smaller for stronger participants. Put simply, strong test-takers stay engaged when they <b>encounter</b> <b>difficult</b> items, whereas poor test-takers give up quickly.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Reflective {{practice}} {{is considered to}} play an important role in students ’ learning as they <b>encounter</b> <b>difficult</b> material. However, students in this situation sometimes do not behave reflectively, but in less productive and more problematic ways. This paper investigates how educators can recognize and analyze students ’ confusion, and determine whether students are responding reflectively or defensively. Qualitative data for the investigation comes from an upper-level undergraduate software engineering and design course that students invariably find quite challenging. A phenomenological analysis of the data, based on Heidegger’s dynamic of rupture, provides useful insight to students ’ experience. A comparison between that approach and a sampling of classic sources in scholarship on learning, reflectiveness, and defensiveness has implications for teaching and education research in software design – and more generally. In addition, a clearer understanding of the concepts presented in this paper should enable faculty to bring a more sophisticated analysis to student feedback, and lead to a more informed and productive interpretation by both instructor and administration...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{prevalence}} of difficult psychiatrist-patient interactions of 20 psychiatrists in the South Texas Psychiatric practice-based research network, determine what characteristics were associated with “difficult ” patients, and compare findings with previous studies in primary care. Methods: During a 2 -month observational study, psychiatrists collected patient information on set-ting, demographics, diagnoses, and medications and rated the patients using the Difficult Doctor-Patient Relationship Questionnaire, which had previously been used and validated in the primary care setting. Results: A total of 905 valid data cards were collected. Difficult patients were identified in 15 % of the sample. Diagnoses of schizophrenia, alcohol/substance abuse, and personality disorder were associated with difficulty. Psychiatrists least burdened by difficult patients were older and in a solo practice and worked 51 to 55 hours per week. Conclusions: This cross-sectional study demonstrates that psychiatrists <b>encounter</b> <b>difficult</b> patients at a rate (15 %) {{similar to that of}} primary care physicians.

Cognitive style is a term to explain human natural preferences in gathering and processing information.

Regulated facilities must implement a RMProgram and submit a RMPlan before 21 June 1999. The RMP regulations will require most Flexible Polyurethane Foam (FPF) manufacturing {{facilities to}} register and submit an RMPlan because they use or store toluene diisocyanate (TDI) in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities specified in the RMP regulations. In developing the RMProgram many FPF manufacturers will <b>encounter</b> <b>difficult</b> business decisions {{due to the lack}} of complete and timely guidance from EPA, the unique properties of TDI, and the methods used to handle TDI at the FPF manufacturing facilities. This paper discusses the issues associated with developing a RMProgram for a FPF manufacturing facility. The paper is based on the experience obtained while developing a RMP guideline document for TDI for the Polyurethane Foam Manufacturing Association (PFA) 1. The RMP regulations require an offsite consequence analysis be conducted for the worst-case release of the regulated chemical(s). This analysis may be conducted using dispersion modeling techniques or EPA “look-up ” tables.

As health care becomes increasingly complex, these providers <b>encounter</b> <b>difficult</b> ethical issues in patient care, perceive limited respect in their work, and are increasingly dissatisfied. However, the link between ethics-related work factors and job satisfaction and intent-to-leave one's job has rarely been considered. In this paper, we describe how nurses {{and social workers}} in the US view the ethical climate in which they work, including the degree of ethics stress they feel, and the adequacy of organizational resources to address their ethical concerns. Controlling for socio-demographics, we examined {{the extent to which}} these factors affect nurses and social workers' job satisfaction and their interest in leaving their current position. Data were from self-administered mail questionnaires of 1215 randomly selected nurses and social workers in four census regions of the US. Respondents reported feeling powerless (32. 5 %) and overwhelmed (34. 7 %) with ethical issues in the workplace and frustration (52. 8 %) and fatigue (40 %) when they cannot resolve ethical issues. In multivariate models, a positive ethical climate and job satisfaction protected against respondents' intentions to leave as did perceptions of adequate or extensive institutional support for dealing with ethical issues. Black nurses were 3. 21 times more likely than white nurses to want to leave their position. We suggest several strategies to reduce ethics stress and improve the ethical climate of the workplace for nurses and social workers.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the course "Doing Economics with the Computer" we taught since 1999 at the University of Bern, Switzerland. "Doing Economics with the Computer" is a course we designed to introduce sophomores playfully and painlessly into computational economics. Computational methods are usually used in economics to analyze complex problems, which are impossible (or very difficult) to solve analytically. However, our course only looks at economic models, which can (easily) be solved analytically. This approach has two advantages: First, relying on economic theory students have met {{in their first}} year, we can introduce numerical methods at an early stage. This stimulates students to use computational methods later in their academic career when they <b>encounter</b> <b>difficult</b> problems. Second, the confrontation with the analytical analysis shows convincingly both power and limits of numerical methods. Our course introduces students to three types of software: spreadsheet and simple optimizer (Excel with Solver), numerical computation (Matlab) and symbolic computation (Maple). The course consists of 10 sessions, we taught each in a 3 -hour lecture. In the 1 st part of each session we present the economic problem, sometimes its analytical solution and introduce the software used. The 2 nd part, in the computer lab, starts the numerical implementation with step-by-step guidance. In this part, students work on exercises with clearly defined questions and precise guidance for their implementation. The 3 rd part is a workshop, where students work in groups on exercises with still very clear defined questions but no help on their implementation. This part teaches students how to practically handle numerical questions in a well-defined framework. The 4 th part of a session is a graded take home assignment where {{students are asked to}} answer general economic questions. This part teaches students how to translate general economic questions into a numerical task and back into an economically meaningful answer.

40|$|Motivated by the {{aesthetics}} of contemporary Young Adult fiction, we seek to examine the potential that these novels contain concerning processes of personal formation, education and identity. Many young individuals <b>encounter</b> <b>difficult</b> subjects such as responsibilities, friends, misunderstandings, sex and intoxications, {{at a much higher}} level than they have yet experienced. Regarding these subjects, young individuals will contemplate others in order to make sense of society, and take position in it. However, ‘others’ need not be real, as the choices that fictional characters make also can be weighted. Some novels even contain protagonists going through the same particular stage in life, offering the young individual an opportunity to reflect upon various possibilities of identity, and the consequences of these. The genre is called Young Adult fiction, and is the subject focused upon in the following project. This project contains an analysis on the three Danish Young Adult novels, Dig og mig ved daggry by Sanne Munk Jensen & Glenn Ringtved, Komatøs by Ronnie Andersen and Louis 121092 - 2922 by Johanne Algren. Starting out, we seek to investigate the genre of current Danish contemporary realistic Young Adult novels. In doing this, our primary theoreticians are Lone Billeskov Jansen, Ayoe Quist Henkel, Martin Blok Johansen and Bodil Kampp. Thereafter, we examine whether the novels fit into these definitions. In order to analyze the novels, we use text analytic theory from Annemette Hejlsted, and point out some deficiencies regarding the theory. Having classified the novels we add a psychological perspective on what potential the three novels hold in helping young readers forming an identity, borrowing theories from Bernt Gustavsson, Wolfgang Klafki and Erik Homburger Erikson. Finally, we conclude that all three novels invite the young readers to consider {{the aesthetics}} and values of identity. Concerning the potential in helping to develop a young readers we find that Dig og mig ved daggry and Komatøs holds more potential than Louis 121092 - 2922...|$|E
