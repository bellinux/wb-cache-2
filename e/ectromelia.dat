Bioinformatics indicated that <b>ectromelia</b> virus, the causative agent of lethal mousepox, encoded four proteins, EVM 002, EVM 005, EVM 154, and EVM 165, containing putative F-box domains. In contrast to cellular F-box proteins, the <b>ectromelia</b> virus proteins contain C-terminal F-box domains in conjunction with N-terminal ankyrin repeats, a combination {{that has not been}} previously reported for cellular proteins. These observations suggested that the <b>ectromelia</b> virus F-box proteins interact with SCF (Skp 1, cullin- 1, and F-box) ubiquitin ligases. We focused our studies on EVM 005, since this protein had only one ortholog in cowpox virus. Using mass spectrometry, we identified cullin- 1 as a binding partner for EVM 005, and this interaction was confirmed by overexpression of hemagglutinin (HA) -cullin- 1. During infection, Flag-EVM 005 and HA-cullin- 1 colocalized to distinct cellular bodies. Significantly, EVM 005 coprecipitated with endogenous Skp 1, cullin- 1, and Roc 1 and associated with conjugated ubiquitin, suggesting that EVM 005 interacted with the components of a functional ubiquitin ligase.

40|$|Poxviruses contain large dsDNA genomes {{encoding}} numerous open reading frames that manipulate cellular signalling pathways and {{interfere with}} the host immune response. The NF-κB signalling cascade is an important mediator of innate immunity and inflammation, and is tightly regulated by ubiquitination at several key points. A critical step in NF-κB activation is the ubiquitination and degradation of the inhibitor of kappaB (IκBα), by the cellular SCFβ-TRCP ubiquitin ligase complex. We show here that upon stimulation with TNFα or IL- 1 β, Orthopoxvirus-infected cells displayed an accumulation of phosphorylated IκBα, indicating that NF-κB activation was inhibited during poxvirus infection. <b>Ectromelia</b> virus is the causative agent of lethal mousepox, a natural disease that is fatal in mice. Previously, we identified {{a family of four}} <b>ectromelia</b> virus genes (EVM 002, EVM 005, EVM 154 and EVM 165) that contain N-terminal ankyrin repeats and C-terminal F-box domains that interact with the cellular SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. Since degradation of IκBα is catalyzed by the SCFβ-TRCP ubiquitin ligase, we investigated the role of the <b>ectromelia</b> virus ankyrin/F-box protein, EVM 005, in the regulation of NF-κB. Expression of Flag-EVM 005 inhibited both TNFα- and IL- 1 β-stimulated IκBα degradation and p 65 nuclear translocation. Inhibition of the NF-κB pathway by EVM 005 was dependent on the F-box domain, and interaction with the SCF complex. Additionally, <b>ectromelia</b> virus devoid of EVM 005 was shown to inhibit NF-κB activation, despite lacking the EVM 005 open reading frame.

Poxviruses are the only family of viruses known to encode multiple BTB/kelch proteins, suggesting that poxviruses may modulate the ubiquitin pathway through interaction with cullin- 3. <b>Ectromelia</b> virus encodes four BTB/kelch proteins and one BTB-only protein. Here we demonstrate that two of the <b>ectromelia</b> virus-encoded BTB/kelch proteins, EVM 150 and EVM 167, interacted with cullin- 3. Similar to cellular BTB proteins, the BTB domain of EVM 150 and EVM 167 was necessary and sufficient for cullin- 3 interaction. During infection, EVM 150 and EVM 167 localized to discrete cytoplasmic regions, which co-localized with cullin- 3.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Ectromelia</b> virus, {{a member}} of the Orthopox genus, is the causative agent of the highly {{infectious}} mousepox disease. Previous studies have shown that different poxviruses induce cell-cell fusion which is manifested by the formation of multinucleated-giant cells (polykaryocytes). This phenomenon has been widely studied with vaccinia virus in conditions which require artificial acidification of the medium. Results We show that <b>Ectromelia</b> virus induces cell-cell fusion under neutral pH conditions and requires the presence of a sufficient amount of viral particles on the plasma membrane of infected cells. This could be achieved by infection with a replicating virus and its propagation in infected cells (fusion "from within") or by infection with a high amount of virus particles per cell (fusion "from without"). Inhibition of virus maturation or inhibition of virus transport on microtubules towards the plasma membrane resulted in a complete inhibition of syncytia formation. We show that in contrast to vaccinia virus, <b>Ectromelia</b> virus induces cell-cell fusion irrespectively of its hemagglutination properties and cell-surface expression of the orthologs of the fusion inhibitory complex, A 56 and K 2. Additionally, cell-cell fusion was also detected in mice lungs following lethal respiratory infection. Conclusion <b>Ectromelia</b> virus induces spontaneous cell-cell fusion in-vitro and in-vivo although expressing an A 56 /K 2 fusion inhibitory complex.

40|$|To {{understand}} the correlates of protective immunity against primary variola virus infection in humans, {{we have used}} the well-characterized mousepox model. This is an excellent surrogate small-animal model for smallpox in which the disease is caused by infection with the closely related orthopoxvirus, <b>ectromelia</b> virus. Similarities between the two infections include virus replication and transmission, aspects of pathology, and development of pock lesions. Previous studies using <b>ectromelia</b> virus have established critical roles for cytokines and effector functions of CD 8 T cells in the control of acute stages of poxvirus infection. Here, we have used mice deficient in B cells to demonstrate that B-cell function is also obligatory for complete virus clearance and recovery of the host. In the absence of B cells, virus persists and the host succumbs to infection, despite the generation of CD 8 T-cell responses. Intriguingly, transfer of naive B cells or <b>ectromelia</b> virus-immune serum to B-cell-deficient mice with established infection allowed these animals to clear virus and fully recover. In contrast, transfer of <b>ectromelia</b> virus-immune CD 8 T cells was ineffective. Our data show that mice deficient in CD 8 T-cell function die early in infection, whereas those deficient in B cells or antibody production die much later, indicating that B-cell function becomes critical after the effector phase of the CD 8 T-cell response to infection subsides. Strikingly, our results show that antibody prevents virus from seeding the skin and forming pock lesions, which are important for virus transmission between hosts...|$|E

40|$|Renewed {{interest}} in smallpox {{and the need}} for safer vaccines have highlighted our lack of understanding of the requirements for protective immunity. Since smallpox has been eradicated, surrogate animal models of closely related orthopoxviruses, such as <b>ectromelia</b> virus, have been used to establish critical roles for CD 8 T cells in the control of primary infection. To study the requirements for protection against secondary infection, we have used a prime-challenge regime, in which avirulent <b>ectromelia</b> virus was used to prime mice that were then challenged with virulent <b>ectromelia</b> virus. In contrast to primary infection, T cells are not required for recovery from secondary infection, since gene knockout mice deficient in CD 8 T-cell function and wild-type mice acutely depleted of CD 4, CD 8, or both subsets were fully protected. Protection correlated with effective virus control and generation of neutralizing antibody. Notably, primed mice that lacked B cells, major histocompatibility complex class II, or CD 40 succumbed to secondary infection.

40|$|Poxviruses produce {{complement}} regulatory proteins {{to subvert}} the host's immune response. Similar to the human pathogen variola virus, <b>ectromelia</b> virus has a limited host range and provides a mouse model where the virus and the host's immune response have coevolved. We previously demonstrated that multiple components (C 3, C 4, and factor B) of the classical and alternative pathways are required to survive <b>ectromelia</b> virus infection. Complement's role in the innate and adaptive immune responses likely drove {{the evolution of a}} virus-encoded virulence factor that regulates complement activation. In this study, we characterized the <b>ectromelia</b> virus inhibitor of complement enzymes (EMICE). Recombinant EMICE regulated complement activation on the surface of CHO cells, and it protected complement-sensitive intracellular mature virions (IMV) from neutralization in vitro. It accomplished this by serving as a cofactor for the inactivation of C 3 b and C 4 b and by dissociating the catalytic domain of the classical pathway C 3 convertase. Infected murine cells initiated synthesis of EMICE within 4 to 6 h postinoculation. The levels were sufficient in the supernatant to protect the IMV, upon release, from complement-mediated neutralization. EMICE on the surface of infected murine cells also reduced complement activation by the alternative pathway. In contrast, classical pathway activation by high-titer antibody overwhelmed EMICE's regulatory capacity. These results suggest that EMICE's role is early during infection when it counteracts the innate immune response. In summary, <b>ectromelia</b> virus produced EMICE within a few hours of an infection, and EMICE in turn decreased complement activation on IMV and infected cells...|$|E
40|$|Poxviruses {{subvert the}} host immune {{response}} by producing immunomodulatory proteins, including a complement regulatory protein. <b>Ectromelia</b> virus provides a mouse model for smallpox where the virus and the host’s immune response have co-evolved.

By multiple inoculation routes, <b>ectromelia</b> virus caused increased mortality by 7 to 10 days post-infection in C 57 BL/ 6 mice that lack C 3, the central component of the complement cascade. In C 3 2 / 2 mice, <b>ectromelia</b> virus disseminated earlier to target organs and generated higher peak titers compared to the congenic controls. Also, increased hepatic inflammation and necrosis correlated with these higher tissue titers and likely contributed to the morbidity in the C 3 2 / 2 mice. In vitro, the complement system in naïve C 57 BL/ 6 mouse sera neutralized <b>ectromelia</b> virus, primarily through the recognition of the virion by natural antibody and activation of the classical and alternative pathways. Sera deficient in classical or alternative pathway components or antibody had reduced ability to neutralize viral particles, which likely contributed to increased viral dissemination and disease severity in vivo. The increased mortality of C 4 2 / 2 or Factor B 2 / 2 mice also indicates that these two pathways of complement activation are required for survival.

Using ex vivo virus immune Tc cells, we have previously shown that granzyme B is able to activate several independent pro-apoptotic pathways, including those mediated by Bid/Bak/Bax and caspases- 3 /- 7, in target cells pulsed with Tc cell determinants. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Here we analysed the physiological relevance of those pro-apoptotic pathways in <b>ectromelia</b> infection, by incubating ectromelia-immune ex vivo Tc cells from granzyme A deficient (GzmB(+) Tc cells) or granzyme A and granzyme B deficient (GzmAxB(-/-) Tc cell) mice with ectromelia-infected target cells. We found that gzmB-induced apoptosis was totally blocked in <b>ectromelia</b> infected or peptide pulsed cells lacking caspases- 3 /- 7. However <b>ectromelia</b> inhibited only partially apoptosis in cells deficient for Bid/Bak/Bax {{and not at all}} when both pathways were operative suggesting that the virus is able to interfere with apoptosis induced by gzmB in case not all pathways are activated. Importantly, inhibition of viral replication in vitro, as seen with wild type cells, was not affected by the lack of Bid/Bak/Bax but was significantly reduced in caspase- 3 /- 7 -deficient cells. Both caspase dependent processes were strictly dependent on gzmB, since Tc cells, lacking both gzms, neither induced apoptosis nor reduced viral titers.

The protein recognized by the three MAbs was synthesized by all 11 orthopoxviruses tested: eight strains of vaccinia virus (including modified vaccinia virus Ankara) and one strain each of cowpox, rabbitpox, and <b>ectromelia</b> viruses. The observation that the protein synthesized by <b>ectromelia</b> virus-infected cells reacted with {{only one of the}} three MAbs provided a means of mapping the gene encoding the glycoprotein. By transfecting vaccinia virus DNA into cells infected with <b>ectromelia</b> virus and assaying for MAb reactivity, we mapped the glycoprotein to the A 33 R open reading frame. The amino acid sequence and hydrophilicity plot predicted that the A 33 R gene product is a type II membrane protein with two asparagine-linked glycosylation sites. Triton X- 114 partitioning experiments indicated that the A 33 R gene product is an integral membrane protein. The <b>ectromelia</b> virus homolog of the vaccinia virus A 33 R gene was sequenced, revealing 90 % predicted amino acid identity. The vaccinia and variola virus homolog sequences predict 94 % identical amino acids, the latter having one fewer internal amino acid. Electron microscopy revealed that the A 33 R gene product is expressed on the surface of extracellular enveloped virions but not on the intracellular mature form of virus. The conservation of this protein and its specific incorporation into viral envelopes suggest that it is important for virus dissemination...|$|E
