5|$|<b>Hypersensitivity</b> is {{an immune}} {{response}} that damages the body's own tissues. They {{are divided into}} four classes (Type I– IV) based on the mechanisms involved and {{the time course of}} the hypersensitive reaction. Type I <b>hypersensitivity</b> is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I <b>hypersensitivity</b> is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen.|$|E
5|$|Immune {{complexes}} (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) {{deposited in}} various tissues trigger Type III <b>hypersensitivity</b> reactions. Type IV <b>hypersensitivity</b> (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type <b>hypersensitivity)</b> usually takes {{between two and}} three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy). These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|Type II <b>hypersensitivity</b> {{occurs when}} {{antibodies}} bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) <b>hypersensitivity,</b> and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies.|$|E

5|$|Many topical {{treatments}} for dentin <b>hypersensitivity</b> are available, including desensitizing toothpastes and protective varnishes that coat the exposed dentin surface. Treatment {{of the root}} cause is critical, as topical measures are typically short lasting. Over time, the pulp usually adapts by producing new layers of dentin inside the pulp chamber called tertiary dentin, increasing the thickness between the pulp and the exposed dentin surface and lessening the <b>hypersensitivity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{classification}} distinguishes two types. The {{first is}} a <b>hypersensitivity</b> caused by a reaction to photoallergens located only in people with SU; while the second is caused by photoallergens {{that can be found}} in both people with SU and people without it.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} {{doubt about the}} cause of the skin lesions, a biopsy of the skin may be {{performed}} to distinguish the purpura from other diseases that cause it, such as vasculitis due to cryoglobulinemia; on microscopy the appearances are of a <b>hypersensitivity</b> vasculitis, and immunofluorescence demonstrates IgA and C3 (a protein of the complement system) in the blood vessel wall. However, overall serum complement levels are normal.|$|E
40|$|Auditory <b>hypersensitivities</b> are {{a common}} feature of autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD). In the present study {{the effectiveness of a}} novel intervention, the Listening Project Protocol (LPP) was evaluated in two trials conducted with children diagnosed with ASD. LPP was developed to reduce auditory <b>hypersensitivities.</b> LPP is based on a theoretical neural exercise model that uses computer altered acoustic stimulation to recruit the neural regulation of middle ear muscles. Features of the intervention stimuli were informed by basic research in speech and hearing sciences that has identified the specific acoustic frequencies necessary to understand speech, which must pass through middle ear structures before being processed by other components of the auditory system. LPP was hypothesized to reduce auditory <b>hypersensitivities</b> by increasing the neural tone to the middle ear muscles to functionally dampen competing sounds in frequencies lower than human speech. The trials demonstrated that LPP, when contrasted to control conditions, selectively reduced auditory <b>hypersensitivities.</b> These findings are consistent with the Polyvagal Theory, which emphasizes the role of the middle ear muscles in social communication...|$|R

5|$|On {{the basis}} of symptoms, it is {{possible}} to distinguish HSP from <b>hypersensitivity</b> vasculitis (HV). In a series comparing 85 HSP patients with 93 HV patients, five symptoms were found to be indicative of HSP: palpable purpura, abdominal angina, digestive tract hemorrhage (not due to intussussception), hematuria and age less than 20. The presence of three or more of these indicators has an 87% sensitivity for predicting HSP.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} symptoms of withdrawal from benzodiazepines are insomnia, gastric problems, tremors, agitation, fearfulness, and muscle spasms. The less frequent effects are irritability, sweating, depersonalization, derealization, <b>hypersensitivity</b> to stimuli, depression, suicidal behavior, psychosis, seizures, and delirium tremens. Severe symptoms usually {{occur as a}} result of abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal. Abrupt withdrawal can be dangerous, therefore a gradual reduction regimen is recommended.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precaution}} if used {{in children and}} in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals. Particular care should be taken in pregnant or elderly people, people with substance abuse history (particularly alcohol dependence), and people with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The use of alprazolam should be avoided or carefully monitored by medical professionals in individuals with: myasthenia gravis, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, severe liver deficiencies (e.g., cirrhosis), severe sleep apnea, pre-existing respiratory depression, marked neuromuscular respiratory, acute pulmonary insufficiency, chronic psychosis, <b>hypersensitivity</b> or allergy to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines, and borderline personality disorder (where it may induce suicidality and dyscontrol).|$|E
5|$|The {{immune system}} is a remarkably {{effective}} structure that incorporates specificity, inducibility and adaptation. Failures of host defense do occur, however, and fall into three broad categories: immunodeficiencies, autoimmunity, and <b>hypersensitivities.</b>|$|R

Immunostimulatory treatment has increasingly been used as adjuvant therapy in the last few years, in patients with melanoma and other cancer forms, often with an induction of autoimmunity as a consequence of a successful treatment.

30|$|Patients with Sjogren’s {{syndrome}} (SS) {{frequently have}} irritable bowel like symptoms (IBS). Some have celiac sprue. The current studies {{were designed to}} examine the presence of food <b>hypersensitivities</b> in a population of patients with SS and IBS.|$|R
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precaution}} if {{used in the}} elderly, during pregnancy, in children, in alcohol- or other drug-dependent individuals or those with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Additional caution is required in critically ill patients, as accumulation of midazolam and its active metabolites may occur. Kidney or liver impairments may slow down the elimination of midazolam leading to prolonged and enhanced effects. Contraindications include <b>hypersensitivity,</b> acute narrow-angle glaucoma, shock, hypotension, or head injury. Most are relative contraindications.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is used {{primarily}} to treat anaerobic infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, including dental infections, and infections of the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissue, and peritonitis. In people with <b>hypersensitivity</b> to penicillins, clindamycin {{may be used}} to treat infections caused by susceptible aerobic bacteria, as well. It is also used to treat bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Topical application of clindamycin phosphate can be used to treat mild to moderate acne.|$|E
5|$|Occlusal trauma {{results from}} {{excessive}} biting forces exerted on teeth, which overloads the periodontal ligament, causing periodontal pain and a reversible increase in tooth mobility. Occlusal trauma may occur with bruxism, the parafunctional (abnormal) clenching and grinding of teeth during sleep or while awake. Over time, {{there may be}} attrition (tooth wear), which may also cause dentin <b>hypersensitivity,</b> and possibly formation of a periodontal abscess, as the occlusal trauma causes adaptive changes in the alveolar bone.|$|E
30|$|The {{current study}} was an {{observational}} study made {{on a group of}} patients with SS derived from a University autoimmune disease clinic that also specializes in metabolic muscle diseases. It is therefore a very selected group of patients. Nonetheless, these patients presented with symptoms that are common to SS patients everywhere and often ascribed to IBS, bloating, diarrhea, joint pain and fatigue (Bengtsson et al. 2011; Daniels et al. 2011). Patients were identified to have various food <b>hypersensitivities</b> by IgG reactivity to these foods. Diets eliminating these foods led to resolution of symptoms that recurred with re-introduction of the foods. Resolution of fatigue required attention to not only the food <b>hypersensitivities</b> but also to metabolic disorders.|$|R
50|$|Auditory {{integration}} training (AIT) aims {{to address}} the sensory problems such as hearing distortions and hyperacusis (oversensitive hearing), which are said to cause discomfort and confusion in people with learning disabilities, including autism spectrum disorders. These <b>hypersensitivities</b> are believed to interfere with a child’s attention, comprehension, and ability to learn.|$|R
50|$|While H1-antihistamines help {{against these}} effects, they work only if taken before {{contact with the}} allergen. In severe allergies, such as {{anaphylaxis}} or angioedema, these effects may be of life-threatening severity. Additional administration of epinephrine, often {{in the form of}} an autoinjector (Epi-pen), is required by people with such <b>hypersensitivities.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{first-line}} {{psychiatric treatment}} for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, which {{can reduce the}} positive symptoms of psychosis in about 7 to 14 days. Antipsychotics, however, fail to significantly improve the negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. In those on antipsychotics, continued use decreases the risk of relapse. There is little evidence regarding effects from their use beyond two or three years. However use of anti-psychotics can lead to dopamine <b>hypersensitivity</b> increasing the risk of symptoms if antipsychotics are stopped.|$|E
5|$|Rabies {{has been}} linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a {{neurologist}} at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in Neurology. The susceptibility to garlic and light {{could be due to}} <b>hypersensitivity,</b> which is a symptom of rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.|$|E
5|$|The chief complaint, and {{the onset}} of the complaint, are usually {{important}} in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous pain in the latter. History is also important in recent filling or other dental treatment, and trauma to the teeth. Based on the most common causes of toothache (dentin <b>hypersensitivity,</b> periodontitis, and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of the pain, and factors that make the pain worse.The various qualities of the toothache, such as the effect of biting and chewing on the pain, the effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of the pain on sleep, are verbally established by the clinician, usually in a systematic fashion, such as using the Socrates pain assessment method (see table).|$|E

Its use in those concurrently receiving pimozide or thioridazine is also advised against.|$|R
5|$|The {{sycamore}} is {{susceptible to}} sooty bark disease, caused by the fungus Cryptostroma corticale. This causes wilting of the crown {{and the death of}} branches. Rectangular patches of bark become detached exposing thick layers of black fungal spores. The fungus may be present in the heartwood without symptoms for many years, working its way towards the bark following long, hot summers. The spores are hyper-allergenic and cause a condition called maple bark stripper’s disease, a <b>hypersensitivity</b> pneumonitis. Less serious is the fungus Rhytisma acerinum which often forms the disease known as tar spot, in which black spots with yellow margins form on the foliage. The leaves may fall prematurely but the vigour of the tree is little affected. Sycamore leaf spot, caused by the fungus Cristulariella depraedans, results in pale blotches on leaves which later dry up and fall. This disease can cause moderate leaf loss but trees are little affected in the long run.|$|E
5|$|Cracked tooth {{syndrome}} {{refers to}} a highly variable set of pain-sensitivity symptoms that may accompany a tooth fracture, usually sporadic, sharp pain that occurs during biting or with release of biting pressure, or relieved by releasing pressure on the tooth. The term is falling into disfavor and {{has given way to}} the more generalized description of fractures and cracks of the tooth, which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms, and prognosis for traumatized teeth. A fracture of a tooth can involve the enamel, dentin, and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically. Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms, including dentin <b>hypersensitivity,</b> pulpitis (reversible or irreversible), or periodontal pain. Accordingly, there is no single test or combination of symptoms that accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth, it's highly suggestive of the disorder. Vertical fractures can be very difficult to identify because the crack can rarely be probed or seen on radiographs, as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how the split between two adjacent panes of glass is invisible when facing them).|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, Swiss {{physician}} René Flammer {{discovered an}} antigen within the mushroom that stimulates an autoimmune reaction causing the body's immune cells to consider its own {{red blood cells}} as foreign and attack them. Despite this, {{it was not until}} 1990 that guidebooks firmly warned against eating P.involutus, and one Italian guidebook recommended it as edible in 1998. The relatively rare immunohemolytic syndrome occurs following the repeated ingestion of Paxillus mushrooms. Most commonly it arises when the person has ingested the mushroom {{for a long period of}} time, sometimes for many years, and has shown mild gastrointestinal symptoms on previous occasions. The Paxillus syndrome is better classed as a <b>hypersensitivity</b> reaction than a toxicological reaction as it is caused not by a genuinely poisonous substance but by the antigen in the mushroom. The antigen is still of unknown structure but it stimulates the formation of IgG antibodies in the blood serum. In the course of subsequent meals, antigen-antibody complexes are formed; these complexes attach to the surface of blood cells and eventually lead to their breakdown.|$|E
50|$|Many {{food allergies}} {{are caused by}} <b>hypersensitivities</b> to {{particular}} proteins in different foods. Proteins have unique properties {{that allow them to}} become allergens, such as stabilizing forces in their tertiary and quaternary structures which prevent degradation during digestion. Many theoretically allergenic proteins cannot survive the destructive environment of the digestive tract, thus do not trigger hypersensitive reactions.|$|R

25|$|Other {{cellular}} <b>hypersensitivities</b> include cytotoxic T {{cell mediated}} auto-immune disease, {{and a similar}} phenomenon; transplant rejection. Helper T cells are required to fuel {{the development of these}} diseases. In order to create sufficient auto-reactive killer T cells, interleukin-2 must be produced, and this is supplied by CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells can also stimulate cells such as natural killer cells and macrophages via cytokines such as interferon-gamma, encouraging these cytotoxic cells to kill host cells in certain circumstances.|$|R
