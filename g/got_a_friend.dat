[...] "Ben", however, received far more mixed commentary, and several reviewers felt it was odd to, as Chaney put it, sing a song about a rat [...] "to a guy who isn't named Ben and was wearing an eye patch", which Futterman called [...] "a little creepy" [...] and VanDerWerff, more bluntly, [...] "fucking weird". Despite this, Chaney gave the song a [...] "B", one of her highest grades of the night, {{in part because it}} gave Colfer [...] "an excuse to hit those 'You’ve <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> in me' high notes", while Futterman noted that he [...] "does well in the high range", and praised the verses by Rachel and Finn. Bell, however, called the song [...] "a snooze-fest", and Slezak was very unhappy with the [...] "interminable rendition" [...] which he graded a [...] "D". In December 2012, TV Guide listed the rendition as one of Glee worst performances.|$|E

Terry played bass and some sparse keyboards, and it was there." [...] In addition to Johnson, guitarist Dave Barry was asked to contribute after previously providing guitar on [...] "You Can Be Mine" [...] from Jackson's prior album. Barry stated, [...] "I wanted it to be authentic rock and roll. I rocked it out, then Janet and I got together to do the vocals. Janet is a very nice, warm person, and she was receptive to my ideas." [...] Jackson sang the song in an alternate tone, quickly adjusting her vocals in a single take. Johnson described, [...] "One night I told her I wanted her to sound like a rock and roll queen on it–she usually uses one of her other voices [...]. this, you wanted to be funky, but more rocked out. She did it in one or two takes." [...] Jam added, [...] "I tried to get her to sing a couple of the other vocals in her natural [...] with kind of an edge on it; she [...] didn't like the way her voice sounded, but for Black Cat, that was exactly what was needed." ...|$|E
