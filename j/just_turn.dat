500|$|... "Open Your Heart" [...] has a {{continuous}} percussion filled structure and a chorus sounding like Belinda Carlisle, according to author Rikky Rooksby {{in his book}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna. Lyrically, [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] is a simple love song. According to Professor Mavis Tsai, the phrase [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] {{is a metaphor for}} the act of being vulnerable that corresponds to the behavior involved in developing an intimate or close relationship. The following lines in the song, [...] "Open Your Heart, I'll make you love me; It's not that hard, if you <b>just</b> <b>turn</b> the key" [...] illustrate this metaphor vividly. The concept of the song places Madonna as a victim of love.|$|E

The Who {{was the first}} group that inspired him to write songs and play the drums. Peart is distinguished for playing [...] "butt-end out", reversing stick orientation for greater impact and increased rimshot capacity. [...] "When I was starting out", Peart said, [...] "if I broke the tips off my sticks I couldn't afford to buy new ones, so I would <b>just</b> <b>turn</b> them around and use the other end.

500|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} by American record producer Jude Cole, Lifehouse, and John Fields. Lifehouse started recording Who We Are without any demos, and only had lyrics from Jason Wade when they entered the studio. When asked about creating a song for the album, Lifehouse lead percussionist Rick Woolstenhulme, Jr. said, [...] "Nobody really knew what they would be playing. We just cut it, listened to it and realized it was pretty electric… the kind of song where you <b>just</b> <b>turn</b> up the radio." [...] The album focused on the different emotions of love, bliss, struggles, and pain. Musically, the album {{was a combination of}} rock, alternative, and adult alternative. After being asked about the title of the album, Wade stated, [...] "We established camaraderie on the road and gelled as a unit. This record defines 'Who We Are,' which is why that’s the title. The sound fits where we’re at right now." ...|$|E

Community lead Brian Jarrard attributed some of the fan backlash to a discord between the game's marketing and the actual gameplay. [...] "I think, {{even more so than}} playing as the Arbiter, the thing that people were disappointed with and angry about is that they were promised this experience, through the marketing, of being really backs against the wall, Earth's under siege, we're going to do all we can to save our home planet... In reality, the game only had two missions that actually did that." [...] Referring to Halo 2s cliffhanger ending, Griesemer said, [...] "I think if we'd been able to finish that last couple of missions and get you properly back on Earth, a lot of the reaction would have been placated." ...|$|E

500|$|Like {{other black}} {{players in the}} 1940s and 1950s, Motley faced racist attitudes {{both on and off}} the field. Paul Brown would not {{tolerate}} discrimination within the team; he wanted to win and would not let anything get in his way. Motley and Willis, however, were sometimes stepped on and called names during games. [...] "Sometimes I wanted to just kill some of those guys, and the officials would just stand right there," [...] Motley said many years later. [...] "They'd see those guys stepping on us and heard them saying things and <b>just</b> <b>turn</b> their backs. That kind of crap went on for two or three years until they found out what kind of players we were." [...] Motley and Willis did not travel to one game against the Miami Seahawks in the Browns' early years after they received threatening letters. Another time in Miami, Motley and Willis were told they were not welcome at the hotel where the team was staying. Brown threatened to relocate the entire team, and the hotel's management backed down.|$|E
500|$|... "Blah Blah Blah" [...] is a midtempo electropop song; {{the song}} {{utilizes}} synthesizers and drum machines in its production. According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing, the single {{is set in}} compound time with a moderate beat rate of 120 beats per minute. It is written in the key of D minor and Kesha's vocal range in the song spans from the note of D3 to the note of D5. Lyrically, [...] "Blah Blah Blah" [...] depicts a woman who would rather have sex than listen to a man speak as the singer finds talkative men annoying; blatant come-ons such as [...] "show me where your dick's at" [...] and [...] "I wanna be naked" [...] leave this literal meaning unambiguous. Kesha herself has been frank about this straightforward interpretation of the lyrics. The lyrics have been interpreted as {{a shot at the}} way men objectify women by speaking about them the way that they do in the music industry. [...] " [...] Andrew Burgess of MusicOMH felt that the line [...] "I don't really care where you live at, <b>just</b> <b>turn</b> around boy, let me hit that. Don't be a little bitch with your chit-chat; just show me where your dick's at" [...] was a way of belittling her male peers.

Sassone enjoyed Kenneth and Tracy's stories here, and was glad that Jack and Avery have {{remained}} a couple. Verne Gay of Newsday noted that this episode of 30 Rock was a [...] "spectacular piece of television, and comedy writing, and acting". Scott Eidler of The Cornell Daily Sun called Tracy's plot [...] "very believable", and opined that [...] "any reservations I have had about this show being less than completely real are gone" [...] after watching this episode. Meredith Blake of the Los Angeles Times deemed this a stellar episode, explaining that the Tracy, Liz, and Jack characters had storylines that allowed them [...] "to strut their comedic stuff". Time contributor James Poniewozik reported that [...] "When It Rains, It Pours" [...] {{was a very good}} episode. He noted that Jack's storyline was the [...] "simplest recipe for comedy: <b>just</b> <b>turn</b> on a camera and let Alec Baldwin be hilarious. But it came within the story of his accepting having a [...] assessing his mortality, and trying to distill what matters in his life". Poniewozik was positive towards Liz's plot with Giamatti, reporting that her plot [...] "involved one of the best guest roles in a sometimes too guest-heavy role" [...] and enjoyed the traits from Giamatti's Ritchie.|$|E

500|$|The Guardians Andrew Pulver {{was less}} enthusiastic, calling the film {{a mix of}} [...] "wafer-thin psychodrama" [...] and [...] "plot-generator dialogue". Times Richard Corliss said the action was let down by [...] "inert" [...] drama, {{describing}} the film as [...] "45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome." [...] Justin Chang of Variety criticized it as loud and lacking the nuance and subtlety of del Toro's previous films. The New Yorkers Anthony Lane's verdict read as [...] "It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered—long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant." [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Mike LaSalle reacted extremely negatively by stating [...] "If {{this is the best}} we can do in terms of movies—hoif something like this can speak to the soul of audiences—maybe we should <b>just</b> <b>turn</b> over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with… Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us Pan's Labyrinth not too many years ago, used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. But too often he gets lost in his computer…Why go to the movies to look at somebody else's computer after looking at your own all week?… The actors can't make Pacific Rim any better. They can only relieve some of the pain." [...] Slant Magazines Ed Gonzalez, who said the film lacked poignancy, compared it to a video game: [...] "a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle". The Wraps Alonso Duralde criticized the choice to set most battles at night or during the rain, feeling it detracted from the action, and said the comic relief actors—Day, Gorman, and Perlman—stole the film from the less interesting leads. Jordan Hoffman of Film.com identified Hunnam as the weak link in the cast, calling him a [...] "charisma black hole". Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald was particularly critical of the film, awarding the action sequences [...] "five IQ points out of five" [...] as he described the film as an hour and twenty minutes of fight sequences vaguely connected by ten minutes of story.|$|E
