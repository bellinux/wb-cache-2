25|$|Since neutrinos {{could not}} be {{accurately}} tracked to the specific protons producing them, an averaging method had to be used. The researchers added up the measured proton pulses to get an average <b>distribution</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> of the individual protons in a pulse. The time at which neutrinos were detected at Gran Sasso was plotted to produce another distribution. The two distributions were expected to have similar shapes, but be separated by 2.4milliseconds, {{the time it takes}} to travel the distance at light speed. The experimenters used an algorithm, maximum likelihood, to search for the time shift that best made the two distributions to coincide. The shift so calculated, the statistically measured neutrino arrival time, was approximately 60nanoseconds shorter than the 2.4milliseconds neutrinos would have taken if they traveled just at light speed. In a later experiment, the proton pulse width was shortened to 3nanoseconds, and this helped the scientists to narrow the generation time of each detected neutrino to that range.|$|E
60|$|The {{anomalies}} and eccentricities in {{the natural}} history of Celebes which I have endeavoured to sketch in this CHAPTER, all point to an origin in a remote antiquity. The history of extinct animals teaches us that their <b>distribution</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> and in space are strikingly similar. The rule is, that just as the productions of adjacent areas usually resemble each other closely, so do the productions of successive periods in the same area; and as the productions of remote areas generally differ widely, so do the productions of the same area at remote epochs. We are therefore led irresistibly to the conclusion, that change of species, still more of generic and of family form, is a matter of time. But time may have led to a change of species in one country, while in another the forms have been more permanent, or the change may have gone on at an equal rate but in a different manner in both. In either case, the amount of individuality in the productions of a district will be to some extent a measure of the time that a district has been isolated from those that surround it. Judged by this standard, Celebes must be one of the oldest parts of the Archipelago. It probably dates from a period not only anterior to that when Borneo, Java, and Sumatra were separated from the continent, but from that still more remote epoch when the land that now constitutes these islands had not risen above the ocean.|$|E

However, the probabilistic analysis is usually simplified to a computationally feasible form. Advancing the probability <b>distribution</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> would be done exactly in the general case by the Fokker-Planck equation, but that is unrealistically expensive, so various approximations operating on simplified representations of the probability distributions are used instead. If the probability distributions are normal, they can be represented by their mean and covariance, which gives rise to the Kalman filter. However it is not feasible to maintain the covariance because of the large number of degrees of freedom in the state, so various approximations are used instead.|$|E

Rational estimating of its results should be preceded with knowledge of complex wave field <b>distribution</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> and space. As a result one can estimate the blast load <b>distribution</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> In considered conditions, the values of blast load are estimating using the empirical functions of overpressure <b>distribution</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> (Δp(t)). The Δp(t) functions are monotonic and are the approximation of reality. The distributions of these functions are often linearized due to simplifying of estimating the blast reaction of elements.

The main scope of this paper is getting the ability to make more realistic the Δp(t) functions. An explicit own solution using Finite Volume Method was used.
