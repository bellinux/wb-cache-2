5|$|Many {{animals are}} <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> to motion; for example, frogs readily detect small moving dark spots but ignore {{stationary}} ones. Therefore, motion signals {{can be used}} to defeat camouflage. Moving objects with disruptive camouflage patterns remain harder to identify than uncamouflaged objects, especially if other similar objects are nearby, even though they are detected, so motion does not completely 'break' camouflage.|$|E

5|$|Genital herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E

5|$|Giant otter muzzles {{are short}} and sloping {{and give the}} head a ball-shaped appearance. The ears are small and rounded. The nose (or rhinarium) is {{completely}} covered in fur, with only the two slit-like nostrils visible. The giant otter's <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> whiskers (vibrissae) allow the animal to track changes in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey. The legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. Well suited for an aquatic life, it can close its ears and nose while underwater.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, a {{paramyxovirus}} {{with some}} antigenic similarity to Newcastle disease was {{isolated from the}} brain of a turquoise parrot in the Netherlands.

It is one of many species of parrot that can host the nematode Ascaridia platyceri.|$|E
5|$|Long, <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> {{whiskers}} {{and front}} paws help the sea otter find prey by touch when waters are dark or murky. Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly {{when the wind}} is blowing towards the animals, indicating the sense of smell is more important than sight as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, although not as good as that of seals. Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.|$|E

An inquiry determined that modifications to the windscreen had contributed to the accident but the main factor had been the pilot's handling of the <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> controls.

5|$|Population declines of 50% in the Terre Adélie {{region have}} been {{observed}} due to increased adult mortality, especially of males, during an abnormally prolonged warm period in the late 1970s, which resulted in reduced sea-ice coverage. On the other hand, egg hatching success rates declined when the sea-ice extent increased. The species is therefore considered to be <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> to climatic changes. In 2009, the Dion Islands colony, which has been extensively studied since 1948, {{was reported to have}} disappeared at some point over the previous decade, the first confirmed loss of a colony.|$|E

Although she had been modernized in the 1930s, some of the Mutsus original electrical wiring may have remained in use. While fire in the secure magazines was a very remote possibility, a fire in an area adjacent to the No. 3 magazine could have raised the temperature to a level sufficient to ignite the <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> black-powder primers stored in the magazine and thus cause the explosion.|$|E

5|$|Although B.cuneata {{was first}} {{collected}} before 1880, {{it was not}} until 1981 that Australian botanist Alex George formally described and named the species. There are two genetically distinct population groups, but no recognised varieties. This Banksia is classified as endangered, surviving in fragments of remnant bushland in a region which has been 93% cleared for agriculture. As Banksia cuneata is killed by fire and regenerates from seed, it is <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> to bushfire frequency—fires recurring within four years could wipe out populations of plants not yet mature enough to set seed. Banksia cuneata is rarely cultivated, and its prickly foliage limits its utility in the cut flower industry.|$|E
5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} and pollution are major threats to their conservation; river otters are <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> to pollution and readily accumulate {{high levels of}} mercury, organochloride compounds, and other chemical elements. The species is often used as a bioindicator because of its position {{at the top of}} the food chain in aquatic ecosystems. Environmental disasters, such as oil spills, may increase levels of blood haptoglobin and interleukin-6 immunoreactive protein, but decrease body mass. Home ranges of river otters increase in size on oiled areas compared to unoiled areas, and individual otters also modify their habitat use. Declines in the richness and diversity of prey species may explain these changes.|$|E

5|$|Linezolid is a {{completely}} synthetic drug: it does not occur in nature (unlike erythromycin and many other antibiotics) and was not developed by building upon a naturally occurring skeleton (unlike most beta-lactams, which are semisynthetic). Many approaches are available for oxazolidinone synthesis, and several routes for the synthesis of linezolid {{have been reported in}} the chemistry literature. Despite good yields, the original method (developed by Upjohn for pilot plant-scale production of linezolid and eperezolid) is lengthy, requires the use of expensive chemicals—such as palladium on carbon and the <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> reagents methanesulfonyl chloride and n-butyllithium—and needs low-temperature conditions. Much of the high cost of linezolid has been attributed to the expense of its synthesis. A somewhat more concise and cost-effective route better suited to large-scale production was patented by Upjohn in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Most Proteaceae and all Banksia species, {{including}} B.aemula, have proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters of}} short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These roots are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. A study of six wallum species, including B.aemula, found they have adapted to very low levels of phosphorus and are <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> to increased levels of the element, leading to phosphorus toxicity. Some evidence suggests they are efficient at using potassium, and sensitive to calcium toxicity as well. A field study on North Stradbroke Island noted increased root growth in autumn (around April), but that overall root growth was more constant than other species looked at, possibly because its deeper roots had more regular access to groundwater.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{conducted}} off the Florida {{coast and}} the Bahamas {{have shown that}} silky sharks are <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> to sound, in particular low-frequency (10–20Hz), irregular pulses. Experiments in which these sounds were played underwater attracted sharks from hundreds of meters away. Silky sharks likely orient to these sounds because they {{are similar to the}} noise generated by feeding animals such as birds or dolphins, thus indicating promising sources of food. These studies have also demonstrated that a silky shark attracted by one sound will quickly withdraw if that sound abruptly changes in amplitude or character; this change need not be a sound produced by a predator to evoke the reaction. Over repeated exposures, silky sharks habituate to the sound change and stop withdrawing, though it takes them much longer to do so compared to the bolder oceanic whitetip shark.|$|E
