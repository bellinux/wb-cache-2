2500|$|Testing {{is often}} edited due to time {{constraints}} of a televised episode. It can often {{seem as if}} the teams draw results from fewer repetitions and a smaller data set than they actually have. During the Outtakes Special, they specifically stated that while they are, in fact, very thorough in testing myths and repeat experiments many times in many different configurations, it is simply impossible to display all of it during a program. Beginning in the fifth season, episodes typically contain a prompt for the viewer to visit the show's homepage to view outtake footage of either additional testing, or other facets of the myths being tested. However, Savage himself has acknowledged that they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>purport</b> always to achieve a satisfactorily large enough set of results to overcome definitively all bias. In response to criticisms they receive about their methods and results in previous episodes, the staff produced several [...] "Myths Revisited" [...] episodes, in which the teams retest myths {{to see if the}} complaints have merit. These episodes have sometimes resulted in overturning results of several myths, as well as upholding some results for different reasons than originally concluded.|$|E

50|$|The {{existence}} of logical truths {{has been put}} forward by rationalist philosophers as an objection to empiricism because they hold {{that it is impossible}} to account for our knowledge of logical truths on empiricist grounds.

5000|$|One major {{characteristic}} of norms is that, unlike propositions, {{they are not}} descriptively true or false, since norms <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>purport</b> to describe anything, but to prescribe, create or change something. Some people say they are [...] "prescriptively true" [...] or false. Whereas the truth of a descriptive statement is purportedly based on its correspondence to reality, some philosophers, beginning with Aristotle, assert that the (prescriptive) truth of a prescriptive statement is based on its correspondence to right desire. Other philosophers maintain that norms are ultimately neither true or false, but only successful or unsuccessful (valid or invalid), as their propositional content obtains or not (see also John Searle and speech act).|$|E

5000|$|In {{line with}} how {{a lot of}} theorizing has gone in the last century, {{comparative}} research does not tend to investigate [...] "grand theories," [...] such as Marxism. It instead occupies itself with middle-range theories that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>purport</b> to describe our social system in its entirety, but a subset of it. A {{good example of this}} is the common research program that looks for differences between two or more social systems, then looks at these differences in relation to some other variable coexisting in those societies to see if it is related. The classic case of this is Esping-Andersen's research on social welfare systems. He noticed there was a difference in types of social welfare systems, and compared them based on their level of decommodification of social welfare goods. He found {{that he was able to}} class welfare states into three types, based on their level of decommodification. He further theorized from this that decommodification was based on a combination of class coalitions and mobilization, and regime legacy. Here, Esping-Andersen is using comparative research: he takes many western countries and compares their level of decommodification, then develops a theory of the divergence based on his findings.|$|E

5000|$|It must be {{intended}} {{that the}} defendant objected to the admission of the deposition because of some alleged informality, but what that was is not set forth {{in connection with the}} objection; nor is it stated what the informality was on account of which the court ruled out the deposition. The deposition appears to be regular in form. It was taken under a commission issued by the court, and executed by the commissioner named. The interrogatories forming part of it were put and answered under a sufficient oath, administered before the answers were taken. The answers are not in narrative form, nor {{in the form of an}} affidavit, but each is an answer to the specific interrogatory of corresponding number. The place where the deposition was taken sufficiently appears. The fact that there were no cross-interrogatories cannot affect the regularity, because, under the order for the commission, made twelve days before it issued, and providing for the taking of the testimony [...] "on the interrogatories and cross-interrogatories filed herein," [...] it was for the defendant to show distinctly that there were cross-interrogatories filed which had not been annexed to the commission. In the absence of any apparent informality, if the objection made by the defendant to the admission of the deposition was made on the ground of an informality, that ground, to avail him here, should appear in the bill of exceptions, with a sufficient statement to enable this Court to see that the ground was a valid one, and the informality on which the deposition was ruled out should, to avail him, be stated in the bill of exceptions, with sufficient other matter to enable this Court to say that the identical informality on which the ruling of the court proceeded existed, and was good ground for the ruling. As the defendant made the objection to the admissibility of the deposition, and it was excluded, it was incumbent on him to make it appear, by the bill of exceptions, what the ground of objection was, and that it was a valid ground. The evidence, in the excluded deposition, as to the new promise, was material, and ought to have been before the jury, as tending to show an absolute promise by the defendant to the plaintiff, made within three years before the bringing of the suit, to pay to the plaintiff the money in question, as money then in the hands of the defendant, and due to the plaintiff. As the direction of a verdict for the defendant appears to have been rested on the instruction that there was not sufficient evidence, to be submitted to the jury, of a new promise to take the case out of the statute of limitations, and as, if the jury had found that there was such new promise, there was evidence on both sides for the consideration of the jury on the other issues, under proper instructions, and the bills of exceptions <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>purport</b> to set out all the evidence on such other issues, a new trial must be had.|$|E
