25|$|Immediately {{after the}} fight, Baroni contended {{that he did}} not submit and in the {{confusion}} struck Landless in the face twice. Baroni maintained that it was a verbal miscommunication and <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> for the fight to be stopped. To quell the controversy, the UFC agreed to give Baroni a rematch at UFC 48.|$|E
25|$|On January 16, 1961, Mantle {{became the}} highest-paid player in {{baseball}} by signing a $75,000 ($ today) contract. DiMaggio, Hank Greenberg, and Ted Williams, {{who had just}} retired, had been paid over $100,000 in a season, and Ruth had a peak salary of $80,000. Mantle became the highest-paid active player of his time. Mantle's top salary was $100,000, which {{he reached for the}} 1963 season. Having reached that pinnacle in his 13th season, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> for another raise.|$|E
25|$|While {{some of his}} men thought Oates to be too {{aggressive}} {{for his own good}} and theirs, most admired his courage and affirmed that he was always to be found at the front of his men, in the thick of combat, and that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> them to go anywhere that he was not willing to go himself. A political rival, Alexander Lowther, would replace Oates as regimental commander in July 1864 after allegedly engineering Oates' removal from command. It was Oates, however, who led the 15th Alabama into its most noted engagement of the war, at Little Round Top on July 2, 1863, during {{the second day of the}} Battle of Gettysburg.|$|E

6000|$|... "This isn't right!" [...] cried Larry. [...] "Dick is my friend, {{and let me}} say <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>asks</b> any cadet to knuckle under to him, {{unless the}} cadet did {{something}} that wasn't on the level." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He.</b> <b>Never</b> <b>ask</b> a man {{his opinion}} of a woman's dress when he is desperately and abjectly {{in love with the}} wearer. Let me look. Like {{everything}} else of yours it's perfect. Where did you get it from? ...|$|R
500|$|The {{surviving}} group regroups on {{the highway}} {{which they had been}} taking to reach Fort Benning {{at the start of the}} season, and assume Andrea is dead. With their remaining vehicles, they travel on back roads to avoid hordes, until one runs out of gas. They camp for the night, where Daryl pressures Rick on how Randall's body had reanimated without a walker bite. Rick reveals what Dr. Edwin Jenner whispered in his ear: they are all infected carriers of the walker pathogen, and become walkers if they die for any reason. Rick also reveals that he had been forced to kill Shane, and Carl had shot his reanimated form, shocking Lori. As they continue to debate, the others, save for Daryl and Hershel, start to lose their faith in Rick as a leader. A noise echoing in the distance places the group on high alert, but Rick does not allow anyone to investigate. Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride) urges Rick to take action, causing Rick to snap, saying that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> that he be put in charge, and blurting out that he had killed Shane for their sake. He dares anyone to leave the safety of the camp. When nobody leaves he issues a final warning: [...] "If you're staying, this isn't a democracy anymore," [...] establishing his position as leader of the group. Afterwards it is shown that the group is unknowingly camped near a prison.|$|E
2500|$|The Rev. Moon has a {{very good}} sense of humor. It's hard for me to think of a person as being mean or {{brainwashing}} people with the sense of humor he has. He truly loves people. I mean, he likes being with them. He likes being kidded-he likes being teased. I never saw a mean act on his part. [...] <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> for special treatment. He mopped floors and cleaned tables, and he helped other people when he was finished with his job.|$|E
2500|$|Hatch was {{reportedly}} beloved by Michigan athletes. [...] All-American Albert Wistert {{told a story}} about Hatch's kindness to him. [...] Wistert's older brothers, Francis [...] "Whitey" [...] and Alvin, had also played for Michigan, and had been All-Americans wearing the No. 11 jersey. [...] The youngest Wistert said <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> for the No. 11 jersey, but Hatch had saved it for him. [...] When Wistert picked up his uniform in 1940, Hatch reached under the counter {{and pulled out the}} No. 11 jersey. [...] Wistert later recalled, [...] "I never needed a pep talk after that. [...] Every time I put on that jersey, that was all I needed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He was too good," [...] said a Greenvale man crustily. [...] "He {{just let}} himself be imposed upon all his life. There's {{dozens of people}} owes him and <b>he's</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> for a cent from them. And he's always had some shiftless critter or other hanging round and devouring his substance." ...|$|R
60|$|AUGUSTA, Yes. I {{happen to}} know that he has very little money. He makes none, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>asks</b> anyone for a bill. He spends what he has on this kind of thing--{{research}}, for the benefit of humanity, as he thinks,--but very little research work succeeds, and even then it doesn't pay.|$|R

2500|$|Religion is a {{fundamental}} fact of life to Henry, who is presented as truly pious. Shakespeare may have taken this aspect of Henry's character from Edward Hall's description of him: [...] "He did abhor of his own nature, all the vices, as well of the body as of the soul; and from his very infancy he was of honest conversation and pure integrity; no knower of evil, and a keeper of all goodness; a despiser of all things which were wont to cause the minds of mortal men to slide or appair. Besides this, patience was so radicate in his heart {{that of all the}} injuries to him committed (which were no small number) <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> vengeance nor punishment, but for that rendered to Almighty God, his Creator, hearty thanks, thinking that by this trouble and adversity his sins were to him forgotten and forgiven." ...|$|E

25|$|At home, Laura is met by Mr. Boast and Mr. Brewster, who ask Laura if {{she would}} be {{interested}} in a teaching position at a settlement led by Brewster twelve miles (19km) from town. The school superintendent, George Williams, comes and tests Laura (though she is two months too young, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>asks</b> her age), and she is awarded a third-grade teaching certificate.|$|R

6000|$|... "Not exactly;--because <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> me. For {{the moment}} I was weak, and so I {{let him have}} another chance. I shall {{not have been a}} good friend to him if it ends in his marrying this Yankee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> for {{personal}} indulgences,' said the Earl. His further speech {{was interrupted by}} a quick step, a slow opening of the door, and the entrance of James Frost, who grasped his outstretched hand with a breathless inquiry.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I don't {{recollect}} that he did," [...] said Norman; [...] "but I observed <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> directly {{after her}} {{if he could}} help it, but always was trying to lead, in some round-about way, to hearing what she was doing." ...|$|E

60|$|Ellen {{watched her}} father eat {{and waited for}} him to speak. It occured to her strangely that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> about the sheep or the new-born lambs. She divined with a subtle new woman's intuition that he cared nothing for his sheep.|$|E
6000|$|... "But he isn't {{especially}} interested. He didn't probe {{far enough}} into the case. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> why {{the key to}} Alora's door was missing, yet the maid found the door ajar--half open," [...] said Mary Louise. [...] "Would she take the key and leave the door open?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know how}} it was at first between him and me. He objected to me violently,--I mean openly, to my face.

That was strange." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{always seems}} to make Jack blue and grumpy when I talk like that. I suppose {{that is one reason}} why <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> me to settle down in life as a country doctor's wife. Another was, no doubt, that I always nipped his sentimental sproutings religiously in the bud.|$|E
6000|$|Lady Laura {{paused a}} moment, {{thinking}} what reply she should make;--and {{then she told}} a fib. [...] "No; <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> me."
