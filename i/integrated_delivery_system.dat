5000|$|An <b>integrated</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> (IDS) is {{a network}} of health care {{organizations}} under a parent holding company.

Two key concepts in global theory, risk and episodic management, are introduced, and utilized to show how IDSs addressed these fundamental properties inappropriately.

40|$|Implementation {{of disease}} {{management}} programmes within an <b>integrated</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> (IDS) requires a multipronged approach utilising education, process changes, tools and communication to overcome barriers. Implementation {{efforts should be}} directed toward {{every member of the}} staff who comes in contact with the patient, not just the physician. Successful implementation of disease management programmes using the above approaches has made it easy for those within the Lovelace Health System IDS to do the `right things' for and by the patient. In this IDS, processes are embedded and transparent. Clinical data are presented at a patient level and are actionable. The horizontal and vertical integration of this IDS has facilitated the relative ease of disease management programme implementation.
