Chicago construction worker Marc Smith turned urban poetry performance into audience-judged competitions in 1984. Poetry slams emphasize a style of writing that is topical, provocative and easily understood.

25|$|In Sweden {{during this}} period the Protectionist Party had been established, gaining ground in 1885–1886 due to {{downward}} price pressure on Swedish crops, especially barley. Demands for duties on imported foodstuffs to benefit Swedish farmers were opposed by pro free-trade prime minister Robert Themptander. Events took an unexpected turn. The disqualification of Stockholm's 22 pro free-trade members of the democratically elected Lower House on a technicality (one member's non-payment of 11.58 kr in taxes a few years previously) and the appointment, in their place, of 22 protectionist members tipped {{the balance of power}} and brought about Themptander's resignation, opening the <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new leader.|$|E

25|$|Arthur's post-retirement work {{in theater}} was intermittent, {{somewhat}} curtailed by her unease and discomfort about working in public. Capra claimed she vomited in her dressing room between scenes, yet emerged each time {{to perform a}} flawless take. According to John Oller's biography, Jean Arthur: The Actress Nobody Knew (1997), Arthur developed a kind of stage fright punctuated with bouts of psychosomatic illnesses. A prime example was in 1945, when she was cast in {{the lead of the}} Garson Kanin play, Born Yesterday.

25|$|Players have to {{complete}} various puzzles {{in order to}} gain access to previously restricted areas. The majority of these puzzles require players to retrieve an object from a certain location in order to bypass an obstacle in another location. For example, an early puzzle involves locating a key in order to open the locked <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cabin. Occasionally puzzles {{take the form of a}} quick time event (QTE), in which players must swipe across the screen in a certain direction in a short span of time, or else the puzzle is failed and must be retried. Players can only complete puzzles in a certain order, meaning the game world opens up gradually as the story progresses. Upon completion of the story a free roam option is unlocked, allowing players to freely explore the game world.|$|E

500|$|NdegéOcello's 1993 {{debut album}} Plantation Lullabies was later {{credited}} {{as the beginning}} of neo soul; according to Renee Graham of The Boston Globe, it was [...] "arguably the first shot in the so-called 'neo-soul' movement", The success of Tony! Toni! Toné!'s 1993 album Sons of Soul was also viewed as a precursor to the soul music revival in the mid-1990s. Cheo Hodari Coker said in 1997 that the album [...] "largely sparked the soul music revival that has opened the <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new generation of singers who build on the tradition of Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder". Allmusic editor Leo Stanley wrote that by the release of Tony! Toni! Toné!'s follow-up album House of Music in 1996, [...] "their influence was beginning to be apparent, as younger soul singer-songwriters like Tony Rich and Maxwell began reaching the R charts. Like Tony! Toni! Toné!, Rich and Maxwell relied on traditional soul and R values of songwriting and live performances, discarding the synth-heavy productions of the late '80s and early '90s". Malcolm Venable of Vibe cited the early work of hip hop group The Roots, who used live instrumentation, as a precursor to neo soul's commercial breakthrough in the mid-1990s.|$|E

500|$|When Jason Takes Manhattan {{failed to}} perform {{successfully}} {{at the box}} office, Sean Cunningham decided {{that he wanted to}} reacquire the rights to Friday the 13th and start working with New Line Cinema on Freddy vs. Jason, as New Line owned the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. The concept of a fight between Freddy and Jason was not new, since Paramount had approached New Line about filming a crossover years before the latter had gained the licensing rights to Friday the 13th. At that time, both companies wanted the license to the other's character so that they could control the making of the film. Negotiations on the project were never finalized, which led Paramount to make The New Blood. After Jason Takes Manhattan was released in 1989, the rights reverted to Scuderi, Minasian, and Barsamianto, who sold them to New Line. Before Cunningham could start working on Freddy vs. Jason, Wes Craven returned to New Line to make New Nightmare. This effectively put Freddy vs. Jason on hold, but allowed Cunningham the chance to bring Jason back into the spotlight with Jason Goes to Hell. The ninth installment [...] "turned a healthy profit", though it was only intended to open the <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> crossover with Freddy Krueger rather than to start a new series for New Line. Ultimately, the film series would go through another sequel before that would happen. Cunningham's [...] "frustration" [...] with the delayed development of the Freddy vs. Jason project forced him to create another sequel {{in an effort to keep}} the franchise in the minds of audiences. Based on Jason Takes Manhattans concept of taking Jason away from Crystal Lake, the 10th film would put the titular character in space. The film suffered from the loss of its biggest supporter, President of Production Michael De Luca, when he resigned from his position. Lack of support forced the finished film to sit for two years before finally being released on April 26, 2002, and it would go on to become the lowest-grossing film in the franchise at the domestic box office. It also held the distinction of having the largest budget of any of the previous films at that time.|$|E
