40|$|Kinetics of {{lipoxygenase}} (LOX) inactivation in <b>green</b> <b>peas</b> (Pisum sativum) by temperature and/or {{pressure was}} studied {{at different levels}} of food complexity, namely in <b>green</b> <b>pea</b> juice and in intact vegetables (insitu study). Pea LOX in both matrices was irreversibly inactivated either by thermal or by combined pressure-temperature treatment, and the inactivation followed a first-order reaction. Pressure levels below 200 MPa retarded thermal inactivation of LOX at temperatures above 60 degreesC. Moreover, above 60 degreesC, enzyme activation under pressure occurred prior to inactivation. At elevated pressure, LOX inactivation rate could be accelerated by a temperature increase above 10 degreesC as well as by a temperature decrease below 10 degreesC. The pressure-temperature dependence of the LOX inactivation rate constants both in <b>green</b> <b>pea</b> juice and in intact <b>green</b> <b>peas</b> was described successfully using the same mathematical model. On the basis of this mathematical model, an iso-rate contour diagram for LOX inactivation in <b>green</b> <b>pea</b> juice and in intact <b>green</b> <b>peas</b> was constructed. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>Peas</b> are nearby analogs of high-redshift Lyα-emitting galaxies. To probe their Lyα escape, {{we study}} the spatial {{profiles}} of Lyα and UV continuum emission of 24 <b>Green</b> <b>Pea</b> galaxies using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We extract the spatial profiles of Lyα emission from their 2 D COS spectra, and of UV continuum {{from both the}} 2 D spectra and NUV images. The Lyα emission shows more extended spatial profiles than the UV continuum in most <b>Green</b> <b>Peas.</b> The deconvolved Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of the Lyα spatial profile is about 2 to 4 {{times that of the}} UV continuum in most cases. Since <b>Green</b> <b>Peas</b> are analogs of high-z LAEs, it suggests that most high-z LAEs likely have larger Lyα sizes than UV sizes. We also compare the spatial profiles of Lyα photons at blueshifted and redshifted velocities in eight <b>Green</b> <b>Peas</b> with sufficient data quality, and find the blue wing of the Lyα line has a larger spatial extent than the red wing in four <b>Green</b> <b>Peas</b> with comparatively weak blue Lyα line wings. We show that <b>Green</b> <b>Peas</b> and MUSE z= 3 - 6 LAEs have similar Lyα and UV continuum sizes, which probably suggests starbursts in both low-z and high-z LAEs drive similar gas outflows illuminated by Lyα light. Five Lyman continuum (LyC) leakers in this sample have similar Lyα to UV continuum size ratios (1. 4 - 4. 3) to the other <b>Green</b> <b>Peas,</b> indicating their LyC emission escape through ionized holes in the interstellar medium.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Green</b> <b>pea</b> is {{regarded}} as an important constituent of a human diet, especially for vegetarians. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the amino acids content in <b>green</b> <b>pea</b> {{and the quality of}} pea protein. The study covered raw seeds; fresh seeds cooked to consumption consistency; and two kinds of frozen products prepared for consumption: frozen seeds obtained using the traditional method and frozen seeds of the ready-to-eat type. Compared with the raw material, cooked fresh pea contained more isoleucine (15 %), valine (14 %) and arginine (24 %) but less tyrosine (17 %); cooked pea from the traditional frozen product contained less sulphur-containing amino acids (12 %) and alanine (13 %); while pea from the frozen product of the ready-to-eat type contained a similar or higher amount (from 12 % to 38 %) of amino acids, except for sulphur-containing amino acids (less 12 %). The protein of <b>green</b> <b>pea</b> was of very good quality, both in raw seeds and in those prepared for consumption. In comparison with the FAO/WHO/ 1991 standard, the CS indexes exceeded 100. It was only for sulphuric amino acids that the CS for the ready-to-eat product was 98.
