40|$|Construction {{projects}} are generally {{designed as a}} general contract or a complete contract. In a general contract the commercial contract {{that is being used}} is AB 04 and related advice and instructions, AMA AF 07. In AB 04 there is an <b>insurance</b> <b>requirement</b> that stipulates that the contractor shall take all risks and liability insurance for the contract where the client must be co-insured. Construction law is almost exclusively regulated by the various standard contracts, one of those is AB 04. The Construction Contracts Committe is an organization that has published the standard contracts in this area of law and also the advice and instructions to help the parties to understand the agreements. The <b>insurance</b> <b>requirement</b> occurs in an area of law that is complex and the meaning of the concept is not entirely clear, nor which of the parties’ interests and responsibilities that are covered by the types of insurances that are provided by the <b>insurance</b> <b>requirement.</b> This can create problems for the contractor and his client because the possibility exists that neither party knows what protection, or the extent of that protection, that the insurance obligation provides for the contract. The essay investigates the meaning and consequence of the insurance obligation by discussing how the insurance obligation is portrayed by the literature that is published in this field of law. To investigate the meaning of the insurance obligation it is in my opinion important to also describe the meaning of the insured interest, some of the different types of liability that the parties may have and also the meaning of minimum coverage that are possible to have with the two types of insurance. Insurance terms from two different insurance companies, If and Zurich, is compared with the minimum of coverage possible in AMA AF 07 to determine wheter the insurance terms are compatible whit AMA AF 07 and the consequences that occur for the policyholder in the event that the insurance terms are not compatible...|$|R

[...] Penalties for not purchasing insurance vary by state, but often include a substantial fine, license and/or registration suspension or revocation, and possible jail time. Usually, the minimum required by law is third party insurance to protect third parties against the financial consequences of loss, damage or injury caused by a vehicle.|$|R
40|$|Cognitive decline · Long-term care <b>insurance</b> <b>requirement</b> · Older Japanese adults · Prospective {{cohort study}} Aim: The {{purpose of this}} {{prospective}} cohort study is to examine whether cognitive decline is an independent predictor of new long-term care <b>insurance</b> (LTCI) <b>requirement</b> certifications in Japan. Methods: A total of 5, 765 community-dwelling older Japanese adults who, at base-line, were independent {{in terms of their}} activities of daily living participated in this study and were followed up for 18 months. The outcome measure was the number of new LTCI require-ment certifications during the 18 -month period of the study. We collected demographic in-formation through questionnaires and assessed cognitive skills with the Cognitive Perfor-mance Scale (CPS). The participants were divided into 3 groups according to CPS scores (0, 1, and 2 or greater). Results: During the 18 -month period, 399 subjects (6. 9 %) became newly certified for LTCI services. In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, older participants with a CPS score of 1 (adjusted HR: 1. 39, 95 % CI: 1. 08 – 1. 77) and 2 or greater (adjusted HR: 2. 27, 95 % CI: 1. 74 – 2. 96) {{were significantly more likely to}} receive an LTCI certification compare...|$|R

25|$|Residents of Massachusetts {{must have}} health {{insurance}} coverage under Chapter 58. Residents must indicate on their tax forms if they had insurance on December 31 of that tax year, had a waiver for religious reasons, or had a waiver from the Connector. The Connector waiver can be obtained if the resident demonstrates {{that there is no}} available coverage that is defined by the Connector as affordable. In March 2007, the Connector adopted an affordability schedule that allows residents to seek a waiver. If a resident does not have coverage and does not have a waiver, the Department of Revenue will enforce the <b>insurance</b> <b>requirement</b> by imposing a penalty. In 2007, the penalty was the loss of the personal exemption. Beginning in 2008, the penalty is half the cost of the lowest available yearly premium which will be enforced as an assessed addition to the individual's income tax.|$|R

5000|$|If borrowers {{have less}} than the 20% downpayment needed to avoid a {{mortgage}} <b>insurance</b> <b>requirement,</b> {{they might be able}} to make use of a second mortgage (sometimes referred to as a [...] "piggy-back loan") to make up the difference. Two popular versions of this lending technique are the so-called 80/10/10 and 80/15/5 arrangements. Both involve obtaining a primary mortgage for 80% LTV. An 80/10/10 program uses a 10% LTV second mortgage with a 10% downpayment, and an 80/15/5 program uses a 15% LTV second mortgage with a 5% downpayment. Other combinations of second mortgage and downpayment amounts might also be available. One advantage of using these arrangements is that under United States tax law, mortgage interest payments may be deductible on the borrower's income taxes, whereas mortgage insurance premiums were not until 2007. In some situations, the all-in cost of borrowing may be cheaper using a piggy-back than by going with a single loan that includes borrower-paid or lender-paid MI.|$|R
40|$|Important {{problems}} have been frequently encountered {{in connection with the}} insurance covers of projects in the Arab Gulf Area. An attempt to investigate such problems and recommend solutions thereto is given in this thesis. The investigation started by a study of the economic and the legal background, the legal liabilities of the parties to the construction project and the insurance market background and practices in the area. Analysis of the <b>insurance</b> <b>requirement</b> contract conditions forms used in the ambiguities, shortfalls etc. therein, lack of insurance awareness, resulted ance covers asked for and led to most clauses in the main area, revealed many which, in addition to in inadequate insurproblems encountered. Investigation of 453 losses showed that in many claims, inadequate covers asked for and obtained resulted in amounts claimed being either much reduced or wholly repudiated. Delays in settlements following disputes were therefore frequent. In some cases significant losses occurred, seriously affecting contractors with limited means, as the losses were totally or partially not covered under the CAR policies they asked for. Analysis of 1573 CAR/EAR policies showed the present low adequacy of cover. A system adopted in some cases, for checking CAR policies, improved their protection level, to the benefit of contractors, principals and insurers. To assist engineersf accountants etc., who are not insurance experts but deal with CAR policies, an index has been formulated in the thesis to measure adequacy of cover thereunder. A limited random sample survey among contractors, employers and consulting engineers showed that they think the index would be very useful and they welcomed the idea. The study confirmed that insurers are losing a sizable portion of the market left uninsured whether totally or partially. If properly arranged, these additional covers would widen insurers' market base and protect employers and contractors at relatively small cost. To remedy the position, recommendations are given in the thesis for a suggested new wording of the <b>insurance</b> <b>requirement</b> clauses in the contract conditions. The new wording seeks clarity and adequate protection for contractors and employers without departing from normal insurance practices. Other recommendations given suggested implementing some practical steps for improvement, including the use of the aforementioned index to initiate better understanding and increased demand for more adequate construction insurance covers...|$|R
