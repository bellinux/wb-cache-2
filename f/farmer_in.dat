40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore how the mood of {{managers}} of small family owned firms influence on involvement from other family members, relations with business consultants, and the decision to maintain production. We randomly drew a sample of 90 dairy farmers who were visited and interviewed.

Our results show that <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> a happy mood get more help from the rest of the family in farming activities than <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> a neutral or bad mood. <b>Farmers</b> <b>in</b> a bad mood are less satisfied with the consultancy service than <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> a happy or neutral mood.

40|$|In {{terms of}} the working quality of {{agricultural}} production and the working quality of non-agricultural production, the evaluation index system of the working quality of farmers is established. By using integrated furry method based on AHP, we determine the weight of each index, and establish membership matrix of this evaluation index system. Taking Jilin Province as an example, we select developed regions, underdeveloped regions and comparatively developed regions respectively to conduct survey. By using the data from survey, according to the established evaluation index system, we conduct empirical analysis of the working quality of farmers. The {{results show that the}} working quality of <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> the developed regions is relatively high, the working quality of <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> the comparatively developed regions is ordinary, and the working quality of <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> the underdeveloped regions is relatively low; the physical quality, educational quality and technological quality of <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> the developed regions are high; the operation quality of agricultural production of <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> the underdeveloped regions is high; the operation quality of non-agricultural production of <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> the comparatively developed regions is high; the working quality of agricultural production of <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> the comparatively developed regions and underdeveloped regions is higher man the working quality of non-agricultural production of <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> the comparatively developed regions and underdeveloped regions; the working quality of non-agricultural industries of <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> the developed regions is higher than the working quality of agricultural production.

5|$|He {{applied for}} another patent on an alloy he called {{stainless}} steel, {{now known as}} martensitic stainless steel. The Patent Office rejected his application {{saying that it was}} not a new alloy. Haynes conceded their point, but submitted a second application and supplied a sample showing the stainlessness of his alloy when created using his exact proportions of metals, and it was granted. At the urging of his wife, he created the first set of stainless steel silverware for her personal use. The first piece of stainless steel was forged by Homer Dan <b>Farmer</b> <b>in</b> Haynes laboratory. It was a large meat knife and was donated to the Haynes Museum by the family of Dan Heflin, grandson of Homer Dan <b>Farmer.</b> <b>In</b> later years he claimed to have created stainless steel because she did not enjoy polishing their silver tableware. British metallurgist Harry Brearley independently produced an identical alloy around the same time and applied for an American patent and found that one already existed. Brearley had also created other innovations for the metal, but they were of little value without the stainless steel patent. He sought out Haynes and the two decided to pool their findings in a single company to produce the alloy. Haynes sold his stainless steel patent in 1918 to the American Stainless Steel Company, a company Brearley had created with the assistance of investors in Pennsylvania. In exchange he and his estate received royalties on its production until the patent expired in 1930. The stock he received as payment allowed him to gain a seat among the company's board of directors and he installed his son, March, to represent him. The income from the transaction led Haynes to begin the accumulation of a large fortune.|$|E

40|$|The {{transfer}} of family businesses {{from one generation}} to the next can be considered as an event with far-reaching effects for the business. Investments and decisions about restructuring the business are closely tied to succession considerations. This paper analyzes successions plans in the primary sector using a survey conducted in 2003 of 348 <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> Schleswig-Holstein (Northern Germany) and 278 <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> Austria. Three samples were obtained: full time <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> Schleswig-Holstein, full time <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> Austria and part time <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> Austria. The structure of the farm sector in both countries differs <b>in</b> several ways: <b>Farmers</b> <b>in</b> Schleswig-Holstein operate on larger scales, are more market oriented and use more intensive production technologies than their Austrian counterparts. <b>In</b> addition, Austrian <b>farmers</b> have distinct traditional attitudes in farming and are likely located in disadvantaged areas on average. The analysis focuses on differences in succession plans and farm family characteristics in the three samples. This encompasses the fact that farms in Schleswig-Holstein have proportionally higher rates of identified successors and farm adjustment plans than in Austria. Results also show that there are not only significant differences in farm succession patterns, but also in value systems. [...] ...|$|R

After seven years he sold up to Peggy Greer, a farmer from Essex who visited only rarely and let the grazings out to local farmers. In 1951 she attempted to sell the island herself, but without success until 1955 when a local crofters' syndicate called the Barra Head Isles Sheepstock Company completed the purchase. The advent of motor boats made stocking the islands considerably easier and the company’s ownership continued for the next forty years.|$|E
