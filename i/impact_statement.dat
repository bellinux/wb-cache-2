40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} the current approach to victim <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> in New Zealand serves victims poorly. The primary purpose of victim <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> is {{to provide information about}} harm, in order to assist the sentencing judge to assess the seriousness of the offending. This limits the extent to which victim <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> can meet victims’ needs and protect their interests. This dissertation proposes a new role for victim <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> (with a focus on their use in sexual violence cases). It {{argues that the}} purpose of victim <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> should be to meet victims’ needs for recognition, acknowledgement and assistance with recovery, and to protect victims’ interests in reparation and prevention of further harm from the offender and from the sentence imposed on the offender. Meeting these needs and protecting these interests is necessary to provide justice for victims. Finally, this dissertation argues that victim <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> should not be used to assess the seriousness of the offending...|$|R

40|$|Emotional {{standards}} and hierarchies {{in the courtroom}} may affect judicial reactions to victim <b>impact</b> <b>statements.</b> Based on judicial conversations and courtroom observations in two judicial districts in Minnesota, we suggest that judges contrast emotion with reason {{in order to maintain}} control of their courtrooms; when faced with emotional expressions in victim <b>impact</b> <b>statements,</b> judges appreciate expressions of compassion and tolerate expressions of grief but are uncomfortable with expressions of anger. These judicial responses to emotional expression, however, must be contextualized; for example, the judges we spoke with often articulated different reactions to <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> given by victims of sexual assault, those who are strangers to the perpetrator, and <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> given by victims of domestic violence, those who are in a relationship with the perpetrator...|$|R

5|$|In February 2000, the Turnpike Authority {{gave in to}} {{the orders}} from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to have Route 92 undergo an {{environmental}} impact study, which could go up to two years, to help see if they should award the contract for construction. Opponents of the Route 92 project hailed this decision for {{the thought that the}} environmental <b>impact</b> <b>statement</b> (EIS) would back up their beliefs. Four months later, the Army Corps of Engineers held a meeting to decide what to take into account for the <b>impact</b> <b>statement</b> and held opinions from both the supporters and opponents of the freeway. Around this time, locals sent an editorial to News 12 New Jersey to say that Middlesex County Route 522, already a four-lane freeway, should become the primary freeway across the portion of Middlesex County. However, the Turnpike Authority replied citing that Route 522 would be inadequate to handle the amount of traffic by 2015 that Route 92 was to handle. In December 2003, the Army Corps of Engineers approved the statement and although agencies still disagreed on the wetlands issues, held public hearings in 2004.|$|E

5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and environmental organizations had voiced {{opposition to the}} pipeline project before 1970, {{the introduction of the}} National Environmental Policy Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project. Arctic engineers had raised concerns about the way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of Arctic engineering and permafrost in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an environmental <b>impact</b> <b>statement</b> turned those concerns into tools used by the Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E
5|$|As {{the highway}} would {{pass through the}} Hamersley National Park, the Environmental Protection Authority decided in 1983 that an Environment Review and Management Program report was {{required}} for the Newman to White Springs section. Consultants prepared the report for Main Roads, which found that the key risks were erosion, visual impact, and possible damage to flora. A detailed survey was carried out, which included the use of laser and infra-red measuring devices from within a helicopter, and numerous field trips to determine the final alignment and bridge sites. A comprehensive Environmental <b>Impact</b> <b>Statement</b> was then produced, and the project was approved in mid-1984.|$|E

5|$|In May 2011, Sussex County legislators {{proposed}} the U.S. Highway be upgraded fully along its current alignment, {{with the addition}} of a northeast bypass of Millsboro to connect US113 and DE24 that could be constructed mostly through state-owned land. Despite opposition to its preferred alternative, DelDOT completed the Draft Environmental <b>Impact</b> <b>Statement</b> for the Millsboro–South area in July 2013; the document recognized the significant opposition to the Blue Alternative. In 2015, DelDOT announced that the Blue Alternative was no longer being considered. Instead, US 113 would be upgraded along its current alignment as part of a Modified Yellow Alternative. However, unlike the original Yellow Alternative, which would upgrade US 113 to a freeway and featured several interchanges, US 113 would not become a freeway under the modified plan. Instead, only some crossroads would be eliminated, US 113 would be expanded to six lanes between its intersections with DE 20 on either side of Millsboro, and a two-lane northeast bypass of Millsboro proposed in 2011 would be built and connect with US 113 at a partial cloverleaf interchange near the northern US 113DE 20 junction. In December 2016, DelDOT completed a Supplemental Draft Environmental <b>Impact</b> <b>Statement</b> in which the Modified Yellow Alternative is the agency's preferred alternative.|$|E

5|$|The nearby Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel {{is being}} planned to connect northeastern New Jersey and Long Island, with portals in Brooklyn and in Jersey City, New Jersey.

As early as the 1920s, this tunnel had been planned to cross the entire New York Harbor rather than just the Narrows. As a precursor to the planned project, which could cost up to $11 billion to build, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) compiled a Tier 1 Draft Environmental <b>Impact</b> <b>Statement</b> (DEIS) in November 2014.|$|E

5|$|A {{railroad}} link to JFK Airport {{had been}} proposed since 1968 {{as part of}} the Program for Action, but was not actually implemented for almost three decades. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, various plans surfaced to try to build such a link. Meanwhile, the JFK Express subway service and shuttle buses provided an unpopular transport system to and around JFK. There were 21 failed proposals for rail links to New York City airports during this time. Serious planning for a dedicated transport system at JFK began in 1990. An environmental <b>impact</b> <b>statement</b> for a JFK light-rail system was released in 1997, and the current people-mover system started construction a year later. AirTrain JFK opened on December 17, 2003, despite being the subject of several lawsuits during construction and a death during one of the system's test runs.|$|E

5|$|Alyeska {{and the oil}} {{companies}} fought objections to the pipeline's construction in both the courts and in Congress, where debates about the pipeline's environmental <b>impact</b> <b>statement</b> continued through 1971. Objections about the caribou herds were countered by observations of Davidson Ditch, a water pipeline with the same diameter of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which caribou were able to jump over. To those who argued that the pipeline would irrevocably alter Alaska wilderness, proponents pointed to the overgrown remnants of the Fairbanks Gold Rush, most {{of which had been}} erased 70years later. Some pipeline opponents were satisfied by Alyeska's preliminary design, which incorporated underground and raised crossings for caribou and other big game, gravel and styrofoam insulation to prevent permafrost melting, automatic leak detection and shutoff, and other techniques. Other opponents, including fishermen who feared tanker leaks south of Valdez, maintained their disagreement with the plan.|$|E
5|$|Before the AirTrain was completed, {{there were}} already plans to extend it to Manhattan. Between September 2003 and April 2004, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the MTA, the Port Authority, and the New York City Economic Development Corporation {{conducted}} a feasibility study on the Lower Manhattan–Jamaica/JFK Transportation Project. This project would use the LIRR's Atlantic Branch to Downtown Brooklyn and a tunnel to Lower Manhattan. This would provide faster service to JFK via a one-seat ride and LIRR service to Lower Manhattan via a transfer at Jamaica (i.e. the same plan proposed by the RPA in 1999). Under this proposal, baggage could be checked in Manhattan and transferred directly to planes at the airport. The study examined several alternatives, including using the existing Cranberry Street Tunnel or Montague Street Tunnel under the East River, or building an entirely new cross-river tunnel. The project was halted in 2008 before an environmental <b>impact</b> <b>statement</b> could be created.|$|E
5|$|By 1973, {{construction}} was progressing {{on the western}} quadrant between I-15 in Murray and SR-201 (at the time US-40A/US-50A). Land acquisition was also taking place {{for the rest of}} the southeastern quadrant between 300 East in Murray and 4600 South in Holladay. However, a citizens' group named Cottonwood Inc. halted right-of-way acquirements due to the lack of an environmental <b>impact</b> <b>statement</b> (EIS). Also controversial was a proposed cloverleaf interchange at 2000 East. By mid-1975, an EIS was released with four main alternatives: a no-build alternative which would leave a gap in the southeast quadrant, building the road along the modern-day path (at about 6400 South), moving the southern portion southwest through Fort Union and Midvale to 7200 South, or extending the eastern portion further south to Sandy and then west along 9000 South. Cottonwood Inc. filed a lawsuit challenging the EIS. Meanwhile, I-215 from SR-201 in the western quadrant to 280 East in Murray opened in November 1976.|$|E

40|$|While {{scholars}} have {{written extensively about}} the victims’ rights movement in capital and criminal cases, there has been very little discussion about the intersection of victims’ rights and the juvenile justice system. Statutes that allow victims to attend juvenile hearings and present oral and written <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> have shifted the juvenile court’s priorities and altered the way judges think about young offenders. While judges were once primarily concerned with {{the best interests of}} the delinquent child, victims’ rights legislation now requires juvenile courts to balance the rehabilitative needs of the child with other competing interests such as accountability to the victim and restoration of communities impacted by crime. In this article, I contend that victim <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> move the juvenile court too far away from its original mission and ignore the child’s often diminished culpability in delinquent behavior. I also argue that victim <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> delivered in the highly charged environment of the courtroom are unlikely to achieve the satisfaction and catharsis victims seek after crime. To better serve the needs of the victim and the offender, I propose that victim <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> be excluded from the juvenile disposition hearing and incorporated into the child’s long-term treatment plan. Interactive victim awareness programs, such as victim-offender mediation and victim impact panels that take place after disposition, allow victims to express pain and fear to the offender, foster greater empathy and remorse from the child, and encourage forgiveness and reconciliation by the victim. Delaying victim <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> until after the child’s disposition also preserves the child’s due process rights at sentencing and allows the court to focus on the child’s need for rehabilitation...|$|R
