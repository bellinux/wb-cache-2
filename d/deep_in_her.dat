500|$|Hindus {{remember}} the panchakanya - the five virgins or [...] maidens in this daily prayer, [...] {{though none of}} them is considered an ideal woman who could be emulated. Mandodari, with Ahalya and Tara, belong to the Ramayana, while the rest are from the Mahabharata. Among the five elements, Mandodari is equated to water, [...] "turbulent {{on the surface and}} <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> spiritual quest". The writer Dhanalakshmi Ayyer says: ...|$|E
500|$|Because Queen Mary 2s {{propulsion}} machinery is electrically decoupled from her propellers, her propulsion arrangement may arguably be more accurately described as [...] "CODLAG electric" [...] (by analogy with turbo-electric and diesel-electric); however [...] "integrated electric propulsion" [...] {{is the term}} of art. The diesel {{engines and gas turbines}} drive electric generators, which provide the power to drive four [...] Alstom electrical motors located inside the podded propulsors (and thus entirely outside the vessel's hull). Unusually, Queen Mary 2s gas turbines are not housed along with her diesels in the engine room <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hull, but instead are in a soundproofed enclosure directly beneath the funnel. This arrangement allowed the vessel's designers to supply the oxygen-hungry turbines with air intakes without having to run air ducts the height of the ship, which would have wasted valuable interior space.|$|E
500|$|The {{positive}} fan {{reaction to}} Final Fantasy X convinced the developers {{to continue the}} story of Yuna and other characters with Final Fantasy X-2. Costume designer Tetsu Tsukamoto said that the radical design changes for Yuna from one game to the other reflected a huge cultural change. Producer Yoshinori Kitase added {{that they did not}} want to make Final Fantasy X-2 feel like an extension of its predecessor, so they changed the clothing of Yuna, Rikku and others' to make them seem more active. This was accomplished before the story and setting were created. Because Yuna, Rikku and Paine live in a more care-free world, the designers wanted them to be able to dress up, a feature which became key to the gameplay. Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima described her new outfit as a [...] "natural reaction to the heavy stuff she wore in FFX." [...] Yuna's singing performance was used to demonstrate the pop feel that the game incorporates. Final Fantasy X director Motomu Toriyama said her personality was the result of not having her bear the responsibility of being a summoner anymore. He added that while [...] "she could be seen as a completely different person, ... <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> heart, she is the same old Yuna." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No--no--no," [...] murmured Mildred, burying <b>her</b> face still <b>deeper</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mother's bosom, [...] "not {{while you}} live, can I be an orphan. Not now--another time--this is unseasonable--cruel--nay, {{it is not}} what I said."' ...|$|R

500|$|A Little More Personal (Raw) {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The album holds {{a score of}} 50 out of 100 based on 9 critical reviews, according to the music review aggregator Metacritic. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album three stars out of five, saying, [...] "Lindsay Lohan clearly spells out her ambition in the title to her second album, A Little More Personal (Raw) -- she's going to shed the glitzy trappings of her debut, Speak, and dig down <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> heart, letting feelings flood onto the page". Erlewine also stated that the album [...] "is far from being totally successful, it is an intriguing mash-up of heart and commerce. And it does suggest one thing that Speak never did: Lindsay Lohan may have an artistic vision as a recording artist, which is indeed a huge step forward". Entertainment Weekly 's Leah Greenblatt said, [...] "like so many pop records today, Personal has {{more than its share}} of filler, and like all teenagers, Lohan contradicts herself. [...] Perhaps Personal 's vulnerability is calculated, and its rawness a misnomer, or maybe she's really opening up. We'll probably never know. Lindsay may no longer be on the edge of 17, but being 19, troubled, and ridiculously famous can cut pretty deep, so props to her for letting us see her bleed — just a little".|$|E
2500|$|Flyer was {{designed}} to be the fastest propeller-driven vessel in the Pacific Northwest, and was very fine-lined, that is, tall and narrow. [...] Captain Scott was so proud of his new ship that he rode on her as she was launched into the Willamette River. This proved to be a mistake. [...] Neither boilers nor engines had been installed in Flyer before launch, and without their weight <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hull to act as ballast, she simply flopped over in the water, and Captain Scott had to exit by climbing out a window. After that, another hull was built around her with the hope of making her a little less top–heavy, but this was imperfectly sealed, so water sloshed around in between the hulls {{for the rest of the}} vessel's operational life. Surprisingly, this did not affect the Flyers speed, although she did acquire a permanent list to port, or at least the hint of a list. Once finally completed, the company sent Flyer to Puget Sound and brought Bailey Gatzert around to the Columbia River to run with the Telephone.|$|E
2500|$|After a time {{living in}} one of the {{imperial}} residences in the Crimea, she received reports that her sons, her daughter-in-law and her grandchildren had been murdered. However, she publicly rejected the report as a rumour. On the day after the murder of the Tsar's family, Maria received a messenger from Nicky, [...] "a touching man" [...] who told how difficult was the life of her son's family in Yekaterinburg. [...] "And nobody can help or liberate them - only God! My Lord save my poor, unlucky Nicky, help him in his hard ordeals!" [...] In her diary she comforted herself: [...] "I am sure they all got out of Russia and now the Bolsheviks are trying to hide the truth." [...] She firmly held on to this conviction until her death. The truth was too painful for her to admit publicly. Her letters to her son and his family have since almost all been lost; but in one that survives, she wrote to Nicholas: [...] "You know that my thoughts and prayers never leave you. I think of you day and night and sometimes feel so sick at heart that I believe I cannot bear it any longer. But God is merciful. He will give us strength for this terrible ordeal." [...] Maria's daughter Olga Alexandrovna commented further on the matter, [...] "Yet I am sure that <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> heart my mother had steeled herself to accept the truth some years before her death." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{had turned}} again {{when she came}} towards them across the lawn as though {{she did not see}} them, until, hearing their footsteps, she stopped abruptly. Nobody spoke for a moment or two, but she felt their eyes upon her, and the crimson grew <b>deeper</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> cheek as she turned to the elder lady.|$|R

50|$|First Profession of vows is only temporary, {{which brings}} the Sister to the Juniorate. The stage {{is at least}} three years long, during which the Sister {{annually}} renews her vows. She lives as a Professed Sister and continues to grow <b>deeper</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> life as a religious Sister. This is also the time she begins her work or studies. Additionally, she receives a black veil and a crucifix.|$|R
2500|$|Several album tracks gained notoriety {{within the}} {{entertainment}} industry, in particular [...] "Would You Mind" [...] {{due to its}} racy composition and explicit sexual content. Erotic Revolutionaries author Shayne Lee called the song [...] "a bold and proactive sexual maneuver for even a twenty-first century woman," [...] adding, [...] "she tells her man she's going to kiss, touch, lick, taste, bathe, ride, and feel him deep insider her. She ends the song by requesting that he come inside of her and let his juices flow <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> passion." [...] Its shock value was considered [...] "enough to make Donna Summer's [...] "Love to Love You Baby" [...] sound like Christian rock." [...] Its explicit lyrics caused the album to be banned in several conservative countries such as Singapore. The song was used in films such as stoner comedy How High. Its [...] "gravity defying and mouth watering" [...] live rendition was regarded among the most controversial performances of her career. In 2012, it was ranked the steamiest song of her discography; an anecdote saying, [...] "This song is so racy people {{use it as a}} euphemism when talking about what they did the night before when children are present." [...] "Trust a Try" [...] also received critical focus for its innovation, called a [...] "bold musical move" [...] which [...] "begins with the intricacies of a string quartet before falling into metal attack"; thought to be [...] "within spitting distance of the avant-garde." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} cinematic {{adaptation of}} the play is D.W. Griffith's eleven-minute The Taming of the Shrew, made for Biograph in 1908, starring Florence Lawrence as Katherina and Arthur V. Johnson as Petruchio. The blurb for the film stated [...] "if we could see ourselves as others see us what models we would become." [...] Also released in Italy in 1908 was the seven-minute La bisbetica domata, directed by Azeglio Pineschi and Lamberto Pineschi. There is no known cast list for this film. Unlike all other silent adaptations, this version retains the Katherina/Bianca sibling rivalry. In 1911, F.R. Benson directed a twelve-minute silent filmed extract from his own Shakespeare Memorial Theatre production, starring himself and his wife, Constance Benson. The film presented a heavily truncated pantomime version of the story, with pieces of Shakespeare's original text used as intertitles throughout. It is now believed lost, although several stills survive in the library archives of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. Also released in France in 1911 was La mégère apprivoisée, directed by Henri Desfontaines and starring Madeleine Barjac and Romauld Joubé. It {{is thought to be}} the first version to show scenes which take place off-stage in the play; in this case, the wedding and the journey to Petruchio's house. A 1913 Italian version, the twenty-two-minute La bisbetica domata, was directed by Arrigo Frusta and starred Gigetta Morano and Eleuterio Rodolfi. This version also shows scenes not in the play. Another English adaptation was released in 1915, directed by and starring Arthur Backner. This version is also lost. Intended more as a showcase for a new type of sound system than an {{adaptation of the}} play, the film consisted entirely of the scene where Petruchio and Katherina first meet. Shot using a process known as Voxograph, the actors spoke the complete text during filming, and when the film was played at the theatre, [...] "the same actors, one at each side of the screen but unseen, repeated the words in {{what was supposed to be}} synchronisation. It was expected that the operator, after rehearsal, would be able to project the film so that picture and voice would jibe." [...] The earliest surviving British filmic adaptation is Edwin J. Collins' 1923 version, adapted by Eliot Stannard, and starring Dacia Deane and Lauderdale Maitland. One of a series of forty-minute adaptations of classic texts released under the Gems of Literature banner, only the second half of the film survives, and the final scene is incomplete as a result of print damage. This version very much adopts Petruchio's perspective, and one of the intertitles reads [...] "by noon the next day, though famished and weary for want of food and rest, the Shrew <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> heart admired the man whose temper is greater than her own." ...|$|E
