25|$|Between 23 and 25 September 1969, King Faisal {{convened a}} conference in Rabat, Morocco, to discuss the arson attack on the Al Aqsa Mosque that had {{occurred}} a month earlier.

25|$|During the {{economic}} crisis of 1999–2002, approximately 4,400 Argentine Jews made aliyah <b>to</b> <b>Israel.</b> Following the 2003 economic recovery and subsequent growth, Argentine immigration <b>to</b> <b>Israel</b> leveled off, some who had left <b>for</b> <b>Israel</b> returned <b>to</b> Argentina.

25|$|On November 5 2013, HaKohen told {{students}} at Hunter College in New York City that {{peace in the}} conflict must be synonymous with unity and that Israel should embrace a more inclusive “Semitic identity.” He criticized the international community for aggressively pushing a two-state solution on Israelis and Palestinians and expressed particular frustration with Israel’s relationship with the United States, stating that Israel should stop “trying to be a Western satellite in the Middle East” and calling <b>for</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>to</b> integrate into the region by improving its relationship with its neighbors.|$|E
25|$|Ronald Lauder, {{writing in}} the German {{newspaper}} Die Welt, called <b>for</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>to</b> be admitted into the Western alliance NATO: “Israel needs real guarantees for its security.

He referred to the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia {{and said they were}} reminders of how “unpredictable” developments in the Middle East were. Israeli NATO membership “would send a strong signal to other countries not to take on Israel”, Lauder argued.|$|E

25|$|Goldmann was {{critical}} of <b>Israel,</b> <b>for</b> {{what he saw as}} an over-reliance on military might, and for not making more concessions after the 1967 Six-Day War, advocating a position that the only chance of long-term survival <b>for</b> <b>Israel</b> was <b>to</b> accept the rights of the Palestinians as a people.|$|R
25|$|The embargo was not uniform across Europe. Of {{the nine}} {{members of the}} European Economic Community (EEC), the Netherlands faced a {{complete}} embargo, the UK and France received almost uninterrupted supplies (having refused to allow America to use their airfields and embargoed arms and supplies to both the Arabs and the Israelis), while the other six faced partial cutbacks. The UK had traditionally been an ally of Israel, and Harold Wilson's government supported the Israelis during the Six-Day War. His successor, Ted Heath, reversed this policy in 1970, calling <b>for</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>to</b> withdraw to its pre-1967 borders.|$|E
25|$|The crisis had a {{major impact}} on {{international}} relations and created a rift within NATO. Some European nations and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from United States foreign policy in the Middle East to avoid being targeted by the boycott. Arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents. To address this, the Nixon Administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants. They arranged <b>for</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>to</b> pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. By January 18, 1974, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula. The promise of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria was enough to convince Arab oil producers to lift the embargo in March 1974.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier has {{damaged and}} threatens to damage {{a number of}} sites of {{interest}} to Palestinian archaeology {{in and around the}} Green Line, prompting condemnation from the World Archaeological Congress (WAC) and a call <b>for</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>to</b> abide by UNESCO conventions that protect cultural heritage. In the autumn of 2003, bulldozers preparing the ground for a section of the barrier that runs through Abu Dis in East Jerusalem damaged the remains of a 1,500-year-old Byzantine era monastery. Construction was halted to allow the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) to conduct a salvage excavation that recovered a mosaic, among other artifacts. Media reported that an IAA official media blamed the IDF for proceeding without procuring the opinion of the IAA.|$|E
