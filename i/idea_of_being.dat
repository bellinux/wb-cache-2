5|$|An overvalued idea is a {{false belief}} that is held with {{conviction}} but not with delusional intensity. Hypochondriasis is an overvalued idea that one is suffering from an illness, dysmorphophobia is an overvalued idea that a part of one's body is abnormal, and people with anorexia nervosa may have an overvalued <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> thin.|$|E
5|$|He {{assumed the}} worst in people and he brought out {{the worst in}} them... He clung to the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> 'tough'. He thought that was what had {{brought him to the}} edge of greatness. But that was what betrayed him. He could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness.|$|E
5|$|I {{asked him}} not {{to go into that}} field, that you were going there. He laughed at the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E
50|$|Costumes {{also serve}} as an avenue for {{children}} to explore and role-play. For example, children may dress up as characters from history or fiction, such as pirates, princesses, cowboys, or superheroes. They may also dress in uniforms used in common jobs, such as nurses, police officers, or firefighters, or as zoo or farm animals. Young boys tend to prefer costumes that reinforce stereotypical <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> male, and young girls tend to prefer costumes that reinforce stereotypical <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> female.|$|R

5|$|Lang {{continued}} to visit Oxford when time allowed {{and on a}} visit to All Souls in June 1893 he was offered the post of Dean of Divinity at Magdalen College. Other offers were open to him; the Bishop of Newcastle wished to appoint him vicar of the cathedral church in Newcastle and Benjamin Jowett wished him to return to Balliol as a tutor in theology. Lang chose Magdalen; the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> in charge of young men who might in the future achieve positions of responsibility was attractive to him and, in October 1893, with many regrets, he left Leeds.|$|E
5|$|Construction began before {{completion}} of the design for the gaseous diffusion process. Due to {{the large amount of}} electric power that the K-25 plant was expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own electric power plant. While the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) believed that it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about relying on a single supplier when a power failure could cost the gaseous diffusion plant weeks of work, and the lines to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure. The Kellex engineers were also attracted to the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> able to generate the variable frequency current required by the gaseous diffusion process without complicated transformers.|$|E
5|$|Trevor Francis, {{who joined}} Birmingham as a 15-year-old, {{became the first}} British footballer to be {{transferred}} for a fee of at least £1million when Brian Clough signed him for league champions Nottingham Forest in February 1979. The basic fee was below £1m – Clough claimed in his autobiography to have set the fee at £999,999 {{because he did not}} want the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> the first £1m player going to Francis's head – but VAT and the transfer levy raised the total payable to £1.18m. Within three months he scored the winning goal in the 1979 European Cup Final. Some four years earlier, Birmingham had also been involved in a British record transfer when they sold Bob Latchford to Everton, in part exchange for Howard Kendall and Archie Styles, the deal valuing Latchford at £350,000.|$|E

5|$|Max tracks down Stacey to a flat where Stacey {{explains}} {{that she was}} angry at Archie and was worried about what Bradley would do to him after he {{found out about the}} baby. A minute after Bradley confronted Archie, she found Archie on the floor and pushed the bust onto his head, but ran after his fingers twitched, fearing he would call the police. Max eventually tells Stacey that nobody else needs to know that she killed Archie and sends her home. Becca continues to live with Stacey, and tries to exclude Stacey's mother Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) from her life. However, when Jean reveals Becca's involvement in Bradley's death, Stacey slaps Becca, which causes her to have a meltdown leading to getting kicked out by Jean as Stacey tells her mother she can trust her again. Later, Stacey figures out that Ryan must be her baby's father but decides not to tell him so as to not complicate his rekindled relationship with Janine, even when he is with her in the hospital as she gives birth to her daughter Lily. Several months later, at Janine and Ryan's wedding reception, Stacey confesses her fear about Archie still being alive to Peggy, who tells Stacey that Archie is dead and that Bradley killed him, accidentally causing Stacey to confess the truth to her. Peggy wants to call the police but after a fire at The Queen Victoria, Peggy tries to convince Stacey to admit to arson as the sentence would be a lot less than that for murder. She leaves Walford while letting Stacey take care of Lily who needs her. Stacey also tells Ryan that he is Lily's father, and although he initially refuses to acknowledge her, he later bonds with her and gets used to the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a father while Janine and Stacey are arrested on a night out. Upset with this, Janine attempts to sabotage his relationship with Stacey, but her actions inadvertently cause them to realise their growing attraction to each other.|$|E

25|$|The film Romper Stomper (1992) shows a {{white power}} skinhead named Hando (played by Russell Crowe) expressing {{distress}} about the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a coolie {{in his own}} country. Also, the gang he directs makes frequent attacks at gangs of working class Vietnamese Australians.|$|E
5000|$|The {{teaching}} role often {{attributed to}} the half-man, half-horse figure of the Centaur in mythology {{does not appear in}} Mayo’s stories; the role of the warrior Centaurs does appear, mostly in the stories “The Centaur of the North” and “Conquistador.” However, the figure of the Centaur does body forth the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>beings</b> whose two heritages pull them in different directions, and in the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a mythology that still has the power to move us today.|$|R

25|$|Suetonius {{claims that}} Caligula, {{the son of}} Julia's {{daughter}} Agrippina and Tiberius's nephew Germanicus, loathed the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> grandson of Agrippa, who came from non-elite origins. Hence, Caligula invented the idea that his mother Agrippina {{was the product of}} an incestuous union between Julia and Augustus.|$|E

25|$|Writer Lawrence Miles {{has stated}} that he {{believes}} the Eighth Doctor has sex with I. M. Foreman between the events of his novels Interference – Book One and Interference – Book Two. In Book Two, the Doctor explains that he has become interested in romance and the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> close to someone in his current body, but that he is reluctant to explore these feelings with his companions because of the emotional baggage a relationship with him would bring.|$|E

5000|$|The AAT was {{established}} by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) as a hybrid between court and administrative agency. Among the tribunal's objectives {{is to provide a}} mechanism for review that upholds the <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> [...] "fair, just, economical, informal and quick." [...] The most significant underlying changes introduced with the AAT are the availability of review on the merits, and a right to obtain reasons for decisions.|$|R

25|$|Historians have {{emphasized}} that the sense of honor was a central concern of upper-class white Southerners. The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> treated like a second-class citizen was anathema {{and could not be}} tolerated by an honorable southerner. The abolitionist position held that slavery was a negative or evil phenomenon that damaged the rights of white men and the prospects of republicanism. To the white South this rhetoric made Southerners second-class citizens because it trampled what they believed was their Constitutional right to take their chattel property anywhere.|$|E
25|$|According to the non-canonical Gospel of the Nazarenes, the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> baptized by John {{came from}} the mother and {{brothers}} of Jesus, and Jesus himself, originally opposed, reluctantly accepted it. Benjamin Urrutia avers that this version {{is supported by the}} Criterion of Embarrassment, since followers of Jesus would not have invented an episode in which Jesus changes his mind and comes to accept someone else's plan. Plus, the story {{came from the}} community that included the family of Jesus, who would have guaranteed the authenticity of the narrative.|$|E
25|$|Because {{they are}} found nearly everywhere, {{convenience}} stores in Taiwan provide services on behalf of financial institutions or government agencies such as collection of the city parking fee, utility bills, traffic violation fines, and credit card payments.

The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> able to purchase food items, drink, fast food, magazines, videos, computer games, and so on 24 {{hours a day and}} at any corner of a street makes life easier for Taiwan’s extremely busy and rushed population.|$|E

25|$|When the Ververs {{retire to}} the country, Adam is noticeably distant. He {{suggests}} to Charlotte that {{they return to}} America to oversee the opening of his museum, though Charlotte is violently opposed to the idea. The tension grows worse after Amerigo and Maggie arrive with the Assinghams. Charlotte tries to convince Amerigo to run away with her, only to be rebuffed and told {{that he does not}} love her. Meanwhile Maggie and her father agree to separate for the sake of both their marriages. Although initially in great despair, Charlotte appears to reconcile to the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> with Adam, and the film ends with footage of the couple arriving to great fanfare in an unnamed American city.|$|E
25|$|Commonly, {{heterosexual}} men reject the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> receptive partners during anal sex {{because they believe}} it is a feminine act, can make them vulnerable, or contradicts their sexual orientation (for example, that it is indicative that they are gay). The BMJ stated in 1999, however:There are little published data on how many {{heterosexual men}} would like their anus to be sexually stimulated in a heterosexual relationship. Anecdotally, it is a substantial number. What data we do have almost all relate to penetrative sexual acts, and the superficial contact of the anal ring with fingers or the tongue is even less well documented but may be {{assumed to be a}} common sexual activity for men of all sexual orientations.|$|E
25|$|Louis I was {{succeeded in}} 1382 by his daughter, Mary. However, most noblemen opposed the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> {{ruled by a}} female monarch. Taking {{advantage}} of the situation, a male member of the dynasty, Charles III of Naples claimed the throne for himself. He arrived in the kingdom in September 1385. Although the Diet forced the queen to abdicate and elected Charles of Naples king, the queen's partisans murdered him in February 1386. Paul Horvat, Bishop of Zagreb initiated a new rebellion and declared his infant son, Ladislaus of Naples king. They captured the queen in July 1386, but her supporters proposed the crown to her husband, Sigismund of Luxemburg. Queen Mary was soon liberated, but she never again intervened in the government.|$|E
