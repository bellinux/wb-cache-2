30|$|This paper {{takes as}} its modest {{starting}} point, a re-investigation of two previously identified <b>ink</b> <b>marks</b> on bronze crossbow triggers from Terracotta Army Pit 1. In contrast to incised marks which are commonplace {{on a variety}} of weapons from the mausoleum [11, 12], <b>ink</b> <b>marks</b> have only very rarely been identified so far. In total, three black-painted marks have so far been identified on the over 200 crossbow triggers recovered from Pit 1 (with the characters Jia 甲 (1 st of the ten Heavenly Stems notation), Wu 武 (martial) and Jiu 九 (the number nine), while a red-painted mark (Sigong, 寺工, referring to the Qin central workshop) has also been found on a lance scabbard [12 – 14]. By applying a range of analytical techniques—multispectral photography, digital microscopy and Raman spectroscopy—we are however able both to shed further light on known instances of <b>ink</b> <b>marks</b> and to identify previously unrecognised, matching marks on other parts of the same triggers and to suggest what substance was used to make the ink. Additional spatial analysis of all known marks on the crossbow triggers in Pit 1, and further attention to crossbow trigger micro-style and Qin documentary sources, extend our previous conclusions about Qin artefact marking practices, imperial workshop organisation and product quality control in this crucial period of early Chinese political consolidation. These insights also fit into a long-term programme of collaborative research on Qin imperial logistics [11, 12, 15 – 20].|$|R

For the standard head, the needles protrude 2 mm when the gun is actuated; for the pediatric heads, the needles protrude 1 mm. Skin is cleaned with alcohol, then tuberculin (100,000 units/ml) is evenly smeared on the skin (about 0.1 ml); the gun is then applied to the skin and fired.

40|$|Context: The {{indelible}} ink that′s {{used in our}} elections was developed by National Physical Laboratories (NPL), Delhi in 1962, and has been used ever since. Though formulated by NPL, it is manufactured by Mysore Paints and Varnish Ltd. owned by the Karnataka Government. Earlier, the <b>ink</b> <b>mark</b> was applied on the cuticle but with effect from February 01, 2006 the ink is applied on the voter′s left index fingernail from the distal end proximally until the cuticle using an applicator. This idea of the <b>ink</b> <b>mark</b> applied during elections {{was used as a}} simple tool to measure the rate of nail growth in a busy outpatient department of a Tertiary Hospital in South India. Aims: To assess the feasibility of using the <b>ink</b> <b>mark</b> during elections as a method of obtaining data of nail growth across the spectrum of the entire country. Subjects and Methods: In 74 patients presenting to a hospital, the rate of nail growth was measured. The voter′s mark on the left index fingernail of patients during the recent elections was used as a marker for measuring the length of the nail. Results: The average rate of nail growth was 0. 113 mm/day. The rate of nail growth was found to be more in females, younger individuals, pregnancy, patients on nutritional supplementation, psoriasis. Conclusion: This study which was conducted on 74 patients using the election <b>ink</b> <b>mark</b> successfully confirmed the possibility of using it as an efficient tool in measuring the rate of nail growth. The findings revealed the slightly higher rate of nail growth as compared to a study done by Rani et al. However, the limited sample size in this study was the major limitation...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Small bowel {{adenocarcinoma}} {{is a rare}} tumor, with a {{still not}} well studied tumorigenesis process, and non-specific symptoms that cause a delay in the diagnosis and consequently a worst outcome for the patient. Videocapsule endoscopy (VCE) and double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) have revolutionized the diagnosis and management of patients with small bowel diseases. Surgery is the treatment of choice when feasible, while the chemotherapeutic approach is still not well standardized. Case reports. Two cases in 2 months (two women 52 and 72 -yr-old) of primary bowel adenocarcinoma is reported. The site of the tumor was in jejunum, instead {{of the most common}} site in duodenum. The patients underwent DBE with biopsy and <b>ink</b> <b>mark.</b> Laparoscopic-assisted bowel segmental resection was performed. The pathologic diagnosis was primary jejunum adenocarcinoma. No post-operative mortality or significant morbidities were noted. Conclusion.

40|$|South Korean Joint Investigation Group (JIG) [1] {{presented}} two "critical scientific evidence" {{that link}} {{the sinking of}} the South Korean navy corvette Cheonan on March 26, 2010 to the alleged explosion of a North Korean torpedo: the now-infamous "No. 1 " blue <b>ink</b> <b>mark</b> on the torpedo, and the electron-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and x-ray data of the three "adsorbed materials" extracted from the ship, the torpedo and a small-scale test-explosion. In our previous paper [2], we described the inconsistency of JIG's EDS and x-ray diffraction (XRD) data. Here we report our SEM, EDS, and x-ray experiments on an Al powder that underwent melting followed by rapid quenching, and our simulation of the EDS spectra of Al 2 O 3 and Al(OH) 3. We obtained an experimental value of 0. 25 for the EDS intensity ratio, I(O) /I(Al), and a simulation result of I(O) /I(Al) ~ 0. 23 for Al 2 O 3 formed {{on the surface of the}} adsorbed materials during an explosion. The JIG's EDS data, however, showed very different values of ~ 0. 9 for the same ratio. Interestingly, the high value of ~ 0. 9 is expected for "rusted" aluminum, such as Al(OH) 3, that can be formed by exposing Al to moisture or water. Our results indicate that the JIG's adsorbed materials taken from the ship and torpedo are not associated with any explosion, and that the JIG's EDS data of their test-explosion sample are most likely fabricated. Until the South Korean Joint Investigation Group (JIG) can convince the international scientific communities the validity of their data, their official conclusion that the torpedo sank the Cheonan ship should be discarded.

30|$|Multispectral imaging is {{increasingly}} important as an approach in archaeological and heritage materials science and for object-scale assessments in related subject {{areas such as}} conservation, digital humanities and art history [21, 22]. A full imaging survey of all the bronze weapons from the Terracotta Army pits—using one or more multispectral scanners spanning the visible, near- and short-wave infrared for example—is highly desirable in future. However, for the immediate and preliminary purposes of this paper, we have explored the potential of multispectral photography for characterising existing ink marks on the weapons and potentially identifying new ones, especially {{with a view to}} cheap flexible usage in a variety of laboratory and on-site settings. To achieve this, a specially-designed camera (Fujifilm IS Pro) was used with a sensor responsive to an unusually wide UV, visible and near infrared (VNIR) range of the electromagnetic spectrum (approximately 380 – 1000  nm). The following workflow was used for capture and processing: (1) an ordinary RGB photograph was taken by applying a UV/IR-cut ‘hot’ filter to the camera; (2) IR-pass filters were used to capture four infrared images of increasing spectral range. Then (3) slight adjustment of each image for tonal range and exposure, then creation of an image stack of all acquired images. (4) Because of the different focal lengths that pertain to different infrared filters, small spatial adjustments were made to each image in the stack to ensure accurate co-registration. (5) The background of all images was masked out to ensure it played no role in subsequent multivariate image processing. (6) An orthogonal transformation (ordinary PCA) of the image stack was conducted, and (7) a false colour composite produced using the two most insightful principal components. Given the preliminary nature of the sample, we have not formalised a predictive model discriminating ink versus non-ink surfaces, and have opted for PCA as a most widely-known ordination method, rather than cross-comparing many different approaches to multivariate discrimination. We also explored the potential of UV-excited florescence (via a UV torch and lamp) to study ink marks, corrosion and other variability on the weapon surfaces, but this proved to be of marginal added value. We studied six triggers in this manner, but focused on two that were already known to have one <b>ink</b> <b>mark</b> each. As a complement to the above results from multispectral photography, and alongside closer-range digital microscopy (with a Dino-Lite USB digital microscope), Raman spectroscopy was also performed with a Renishaw inVia Raman Microscope, using a 514  nm Nd:YAG laser for the full spectral range from 100 to 4500  cm− 1. Cosmic noise was removed, and manual baseline correction and normalisation applied. Finally, we mapped all types of crossbow marks across the easternmost trenches of Pit 1 in order to place the rare ink inscriptions in a wider context provided by the spatial distribution of incised crossbow marks that are found in larger numbers.|$|E
