For {{the rest of his}} life, he was repeatedly incapacitated with episodes of stomach pains, vomiting, severe boils, palpitations, trembling and other symptoms, particularly during times of stress, such as attending meetings or making social visits. The cause of Darwin's illness remained unknown, and attempts at treatment had little success.|$|E
5|$|In Bandung, Hasan {{works for}} the Japanese {{occupation}} government and lives an ascetic lifestyle, often fasting <b>for</b> <b>days</b> <b>on</b> <b>end</b> and dunking himself into a river to refresh his body between evening and morning prayers. While there, he meets his childhood friend Rusli, who introduces Hasan to his friend Kartini. Seeing that Rusli and Kartini are atheistic Marxist-Leninists, Hasan considers it his duty to return them to Islam. However, he finds himself unable to address Rusli's arguments against religion and begins doubting his faith. Soon Hasan becomes increasingly divorced from his religious upbringing, at one time skipping the mandatory maghrib prayer to watch a movie with Kartini. Through Rusli, Hasan is introduced to people from different ideologies, including the anarcho-nihilist playboy Anwar; he also begins courting Kartini.|$|E

25|$|Children's {{societies}} {{were one}} of the features of kibbutz life that most interested outsiders. In the heyday of children's societies, parents would only spend two hours a day, typically in the afternoon, with their children. In Kibbutz Artzi parents were explicitly forbidden to put their children to bed at night. As children got older, parents could go <b>for</b> <b>days</b> <b>on</b> <b>end</b> without seeing their offspring, other than through chance encounters somewhere in the grounds.|$|E
25|$|It is {{now known}} that the confessions were given only after great {{psychological}} pressure and torture had been applied to the defendants. From the accounts of former OGPU officer Alexander Orlov and others, the methods used to extract the confessions are known: such tortures as repeated beatings, simulated drownings, making prisoners stand or go without sleep <b>for</b> <b>days</b> <b>on</b> <b>end,</b> and threats to arrest and execute the prisoners' families. For example, Kamenev's teenage son {{was arrested and charged}} with terrorism. After months of such interrogation, the defendants were driven to despair and exhaustion.|$|E

25|$|Over the years, Luthor {{has made}} liberal use of kryptonite weapons capable of {{injuring}} Superman and other Kryptonians. Since the Bronze Age, {{he has also}} utilized various battlesuits in many stories. In current continuity, his suit grants him incredible superhuman strength and durability (enough to withstand a succession of nuclear blasts), and is equipped with rocket-boosters that enable him to fly <b>for</b> <b>days</b> <b>on</b> <b>end.</b> Additionally, it generates a powerful invisible energy shield that protects the entire suit from a majority of physical attacks. The suit is also armed with a collapsible kryptonite sword, axe and staff-cannon, along with dual kryptonite energy cannons. Consequently, Luthor has become extremely skilled in close-range combat.|$|E
500|$|By December 1828, {{like his}} father, George was almost {{completely}} blind from cataracts, and {{was suffering from}} such severe gout {{in his right hand}} and arm that he could no longer sign documents. In mid-1829, Sir David Wilkie reported the King [...] "was wasting away frightfully day after day", and had become so obese that he looked [...] "like a great sausage stuffed into the covering". The King took laudanum to counteract severe bladder pains, which left him in a drugged and mentally handicapped state <b>for</b> <b>days</b> <b>on</b> <b>end.</b> He underwent surgery to remove a cataract in September 1829, by which time he was regularly taking over 100 drops of laudanum before state occasions.|$|E
500|$|Before {{principal}} photography, {{the cast}} and crew bought season passes to both the Disneyland and Walt Disney World resorts. They spent ten days in Florida, then returned to California for two weeks at Disneyland, making the parks depicted in the film a combination of both resorts. Actors and crew entered the parks in small groups to avoid attracting attention. [...] "At one point, I even made the camera department shave off their facial hair and dress in tourist attire, which almost provoked a mutiny," [...] says Moore. Despite the actors wearing the same clothes <b>for</b> <b>days</b> <b>on</b> <b>end,</b> Moore told the Los Angeles Times, park personnel never appeared to notice them, save for one day near the end of filming when Disneyland security thought they were paparazzi harassing a celebrity family.|$|E

500|$|Hoppus {{considered}} his lyrical content relatively {{similar to the}} group's prior releases: [...] "The topics are universal. There {{is a lot of}} angst that could be teen angst or it could be angst of everyday life. I still have the same emotions I had 20 years ago – I get frustrated or I get excited. I still feel like I'm falling in love with my wife." [...] Hoppus considered common topics he wrote about to be [...] "miscommunication, loss of identity and questioning of identity which is a process we went through just by being in the studio, writing a new Blink record and having a new iteration of Blink." [...] Though in the past he preferred to ruminate on his lyrics <b>for</b> <b>days</b> <b>on</b> <b>end,</b> Feldmann's speedy process gave Hoppus little time to process them. Despite this, he felt he wrote [...] "some of the best lyrics I've written in a long time for this record, because I didn't have a chance to go and overthink things." [...] Hoppus's self-doubt on his own creative process is referenced in the opening lyrics of [...] "Cynical". [...] "I start every song with this fear, thinking I'm never going to write another good song," [...] he told Upset. Skiba said {{that at the time of}} writing the album, he and Hoppus were both reading books such as , Blood Meridian, and The Revenant, and he felt the prose impacted their lyrics: [...] "there were a lot of rushing rivers and the whole idea of using metaphors to describe loneliness, just like settler, Native American and Southern Gothic influence of literature, that was kind of our rhyming dictionary." ...|$|E
500|$|Sand {{and dust}} storms are natural events {{that occur in}} arid regions where the land is not {{protected}} by a covering of vegetation. Dust storms usually start in desert margins rather than the deserts themselves where the finer materials have already been blown away. As a steady wind begins to blow, fine particles lying on the exposed ground begin to vibrate. At greater wind speeds, some particles are lifted into the air stream. When they land, they strike other particles which may be jerked into the air in their turn, starting a chain reaction. Once ejected, these particles move {{in one of three}} possible ways, depending on their size, shape and density; suspension, saltation or creep. Suspension is only possible for particles less than 0.1mm (0.004in) in diameter. In a dust storm, these fine particles are lifted up and wafted aloft to heights of up to [...] They reduce visibility and can remain in the atmosphere <b>for</b> <b>days</b> <b>on</b> <b>end,</b> conveyed by the trade winds for distances of up to [...] Denser clouds of dust can be formed in stronger winds, moving across the land with a billowing leading edge. The sunlight can be obliterated and it may become as dark as night at ground level. In a study of a dust storm in China in 2001, it was estimated that 6.5 million tons of dust were involved, covering an area of [...] The mean particle size was 1.44 μm. A much smaller scale, short-lived phenomenon can occur in calm conditions when hot air near the ground rises quickly through a small pocket of cooler, low-pressure air above forming a whirling column of particles, a dust devil.|$|E
2500|$|Every NKVD {{local unit}} had a [...] "casework minimum" [...] of arrests to perform, {{and also of}} confessions to extract to [...] "unmask conspiracies." [...] The NKVD used {{uninterrupted}} interrogation <b>for</b> <b>days</b> <b>on</b> <b>end</b> and merciless beatings to force prisoners to confess their alleged [...] "counter-revolutionary" [...] crimes.
