50|$|The {{following}} year, Winslet {{auditioned for}} the role of Lucy Steele in the adaptation of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, featuring Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman. She was instead cast in the second leading role of Marianne Dashwood. Director Ang Lee admitted he was initially worried about the way Winslet had attacked her role in Heavenly Creatures and thus required her to exercise t'ai chi, read Austen-era Gothic novels and poetry, and work with a piano teacher to fit the grace of the role. Budgeted at US$16.5 million ($ million <b>in</b> <b>current</b> <b>year</b> dollars) the film became a financial and critical success, resulting in a worldwide box office total of $135 million ($ million) and various awards for Winslet, winning her both the BAFTA and Screen Actors Guild Award, and nominations for both the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award.|$|E

Human impact of soil salinization is analyzed with data from remote sensing, official data as well as fieldwork surveys and statistical analysis. The results showed that: (1) Using factorial analysis, we identified three main factors that impact soil salinization: effective irrigated areas, newly increased cultivated areas <b>in</b> <b>current</b> <b>year</b> and newly decreased cultivated areas <b>in</b> <b>current</b> <b>year.</b> (2) Using regression analysis to establish the function of human dimensions of soil salinization in the irrigation area, then it indicated that moderately and slightly salinized soil had positive correlation with effective irrigated areas and newly decreased cultivated areas in current year; {{and the relationship between}} severely salinized soil and human dimensions were not consanguineous, it indicated that severely salinized soil mainly distributed in the outline of oasis and the bottom of river's catchment area, and the development degree of severely salinized soil was low...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relation between}} equity prices and conditional conservatism and introduces a new measure of conservatism at the firm-year level. We show that the asymmetric properties of conservative accounting, the existence of non-accounting sources of information, and the properties of GAAP related to special items combine to generate a nonlinear relation between unexpected equity returns and earnings news (the shock to expected current and future earnings). Based on this model, we construct a conservatism ratio (CR) defined as {{the ratio of the}} current earnings shock to earnings news. CR measures the proportion of the total shock to expected current and future earnings recognized <b>in</b> <b>current</b> <b>year</b> earnings. Ranking firms according to CR, we show empirically that higher CR firms have more leverage, increased volatility of returns, more incidence of losses, more negative accruals, and increased volatility of earnings and accruals, consistent with the literature on conservative accounting...|$|E
