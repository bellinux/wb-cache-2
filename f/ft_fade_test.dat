40|$|Free-space optical (FSO) {{communication}} {{is a very}} attractive technology offering very high throughput without spectral regulation constraints, yet allowing small antennas (telescopes) and tap-proof communication. However, the transmitted signal has to travel through the atmosphere where it gets influenced by atmospheric turbulence, causing scintillation of the received signal. In addition, climatic effects like fogs, clouds and rain also affect the signal significantly. Moreover, FSO being a {{line of sight communication}} requires precise pointing and tracking of the telescopes, which otherwise also causes fading. To achieve error-free transmission, various mitigation techniques like aperture averaging, adaptive optics, transmitter diversity, sophisticated coding and modulation schemes are being investigated and implemented. Evaluating the performance of such systems under controlled conditions is very difficult in field trials since the atmospheric situation constantly changes, and the target scenario (e. g. on aircraft or satellites) is not easily accessible for test purposes. Therefore, with the motivation to be able to test and verify a system under laboratory conditions, DLR has developed a <b>fading</b> <b>testbed</b> that can emulate most realistic channel conditions. The main principle of the <b>fading</b> <b>testbed</b> is to control the input current of a variable optical attenuator such that it attenuates the incoming signal according to the loaded power vector. The sampling frequency and mean power of the vector can be optionally changed according to requirements. This paper provides a brief introduction to software and hardware development of the <b>fading</b> <b>testbed</b> and measurement results showing its accuracy and application scenarios...|$|R

The two strategies are developed as part of a wavelet-based signal processing platform, which can be used to enable reconfigurable radio transceivers. The approach taken is to recast standard discrete time-domain signal processing procedures into a DWT-based framework. To facilitate this, three equivalent techniques of DWT-based convolution that use both subband coding as well as polyphase filter implementations are devised. A DWT-based deconvolution procedure is derived analytically and is applied to perform estimation of several time-invariant multipath communications channels.

A very hard (<b>fading)</b> <b>test</b> has been used to evaluate the performances of the discs in terms of temperature distribution, stresses and strains.

The technique was initially developed in the mid 1980 ’s, to do pre proof printing. It soon became clear that, though the technique had many aesthetic qualities, it also had poor qualities when it came to stability. It lacked light fastness and was very sensitive to high relative humidity levels (RH) and changes in RH. Research and testing of digital printing techniques have always been done, but for the most part, only to develop new, qualitative and cost effective techniques for the industry. Poor lightning policies can have immense impact on all art prone to fading. The IRIS prints have shown to fade more than other digital printing techniques and since the printers are no longer in common use, all IRIS prints can be viewed as originals. Many IRIS prints are also printed on different fine art paper and with different ink-sets i. e. all IRIS prints are different. This thesis will conduct MFT (micro <b>fading</b> <b>testing)</b> of IRIS prints and inkjet model materials. Some results pointed to the fading of a newly produced print to a higher extent than when solvents had evaporated several days later.

30|$|The {{trend of}} plug-in hybrid {{electrical}} vehicles (PHEV) and battery electrical vehicles (BEV) is {{emerging in the}} automotive industries to address the environmental and sustainable issues [1]. Among all the rechargeable batteries, lithium-ion (Li-Ion) batteries have high energy density and a better cycle life [2], resulting in more attention from the researchers [3]. In hybrid and electrical vehicle applications, Li(NiMnCo)O and LiMPO in addition to LiCoO are popular as cathode material, due to their high energy density [4]. Li-Ion batteries are reported {{to be sensitive to}} the operating temperature. Further, internal degrading of cathode material is cited as the major reason for battery failure. Ramadass et al. conducted a capacity <b>fade</b> <b>test</b> for Sony’s LiCoO cell, when cycled at various operating temperatures. They identified that the loss of Li under LiCoO caused the capacity fade at temperatures more than 50  °C [5]. Similar experiments conducted by other researchers on thermal runaway and capacity fade have rendered similar conclusions [6]. Thus, controlling the operating temperature for better performance and health of Li-Ion batteries is crucial. To achieve a balance between the performance and life of lithium batteries, it is important that the batteries are maintained between 0 and 40  °C temperature and the temperature distribution among cells below 5  °C [7]. The state of health (SOH), life span and performance of Li-Ion batteries is dependent on temperature, as high temperatures can result in thermal runaway and degradation of cell material [8]. Li-Ion battery’s nature of sensitivity is highly associated with its state of charge (SOC). Past research works have developed mathematical models to simulate the heat generation rate of a Li-Ion cell. The overall heat generated comprises Joule heating and entropy change during the charge and discharge cycles [9, 10]. It is noticed from the mathematical models, low SOC has higher impact on heat generation and subsequently on the temperature rise of a battery cell. A dynamic measurement of accurate and reliable SOC and an efficient battery thermal management (BTMS) for a battery system used for PHEV and BEV are most essential to maintain the health, life and safety of Li-Ion battery.|$|R

PER is observed reduced by a test-dependant factor between 2 and 100 for such techniques. Techniques based on one RF-front end generally provides little performance improvement in dynamic environments, if any. Large spatial differences in received power were observed across distances {{on the order of}} a wavelength. A simple technique that switches receiver antenna when detecting an erroneously demodulated packet can exploit this property when RX and TX remain static and hence provide great reductions in PER. This fading mitigation technique is the least complex and power consuming among the ones analyzed and tested. </p...|$|R
40|$|Thermoluminescence {{has been}} {{successfully}} applied to the dating of pottery from archaeological sites and the good agreement obtained between the TL dates and the archaeologically known dates suggested that the basic assumptions concerning the build up and release of trapped charges were correct. In this thesis I report {{the results of a}} test programme I carried out on recent volcanic lava of known age: the TL ages were all far too young and hence it was apparent {{that at least one of}} the assumptions used in the dating of pottery was invalid when applied to lava. The most obvious differences between pottery and lava dating were studied, such as the effect of crushing such a hard material to obtain fine grains and the influence of the known occurrence of radioactive disequilibrium in recent lavas, but the cause of the low ages was found to be the breakdown of a far more basic assumption. The assumption that electrons in deep traps are capable of remaining in the traps over archaeological time is the basic tenet upon which the whole of TL dating is based. In the case of lava it is shown in this thesis that this does not hold; there was a loss of high temperature TL during storage at room temperature for a few hours. This effect was called 'anomalous fading' as it is in disagreement with thermal untrapping of electrons predicted by kinetic theory and widely accepted in the literature. The third part of this thesis describes the experiments carried out in an attempt to elucidate this phenomenon which was found to be exhibited by a variety of minerals that would normally be considered suitable for the application of TL dating. The same phenomenon has since been reported in the study of the TL of lunar samples and similar effects in other materials are also reported in the final chapter. Two models are suggested which are consistent with the experimental evidence accumulated. They both involve the tunnelling of an electron at low temperatures but differ in their explanation of the thermal dependence observed in experiments at room temperature. The implications of these models with regard to <b>testing</b> for anomalous <b>fading</b> are discussed and it is concluded that, when contemplating the application of TL dating to a new material, a test programme should be carried out on samples of known age and, furthermore, the agreement of the archaeological stability of electrons with that predicted by kinetic analysis of the TL peaks should also be demonstrated. Kinetic analysis carried out on one of the high temperature peaks in limestone agreed with the stability suggested by the geological age of the sample. This confirmed the absence of anomalous fading in this mineral as had been suggested by short-term <b>fading</b> <b>tests.</b> In similar studies on quartz the archaeological stability was found to be greater than that predicted by kinetic analysis using the initial rise method. This discrepency is shown to be due to the inapplicability of the initial rise method to samples in which thermal quenching is occurring. In the past the initial rise has been the most frequently used method of trap depth determination because of its independence of the untrapping kinetics; what has been completely overlooked is that in thermoluminescence the signal will also be affected by any temperature dependence of the luminescence centres. Once this had been allowed for the predicted stability again confirmed the absence of anomalous fading in quartz and hence its suitability for dating. </p...|$|R
