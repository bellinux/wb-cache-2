An earlier version, the Venucia E-Concept, was unveiled at the 2012 Beijing Auto Show. The car was initially scheduled for production in China by 2015. The Venucia e30 shares the bodywork, dimensions, electric-drive specifications and several {{other aspects of the}} Leaf. Dongfeng Nissan started pilot projects in 15 Chinese cities to promote the Venucia e30 with local governments. A total of 216 units were delivered in December 2013. These units were marketed as Venucia Morning Wind and they were badged Leafs since local production had not begun at the time. In April 2014 Dongfeng Nissan announced that retail sales of the Venucia e30 were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> ahead of schedule.|$|E

2500|$|M. Champfleury {{gives to}} the allegorical {{whiteness}} of Pierrot a wholly physical cause: {{it is the}} flour from the mill [...] that is sprinkled over {{the face of this}} pale and melancholy personage. [...] One could not find a more plausible means of giving probability to this white phantom ...: {{it is clear that the}} era of the Catholic art is closing for the pantomime and the era of the Protestant art beginning. [...] Authority and tradition no longer exist; the doctrine of independent inquiry is about to bear its fruits. [...] Goodbye to the naive formulas, the byzantine barbarities, the impossible complexions: analysis is opening its scalpel and is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> its dissections.|$|E

[...] Long-distance communication collapsed when the Skitters detonated their EMP attack {{at the start}} of the invasion six months ago, leaving the resistance to have to rely on sending scouts to physically run west to try to find out more information, and the runners have finally returned. [...] Porter reports that they contacted another human resistance militia in the outskirts of Chicago, who in turn told them that they had contacted other resistance cells in Oklahoma and Texas, with fuzzy reports of surviving human resistance cells as far away as California. [...] The Massachusetts resistance cell is no longer alone, and they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> coordinating a nationwide guerrilla war against the aliens. [...] Col. Porter says this means they have to start thinking tactically, gathering reconnaissance on Skitter tactics, technology, and troop deployments.|$|E

2500|$|Seen as {{a blow to}} XM's 100% commercial-free music channel status, XM Executive Vice President of Programming Eric Logan {{released}} a [...] to XM subscribers on the company's website that reiterated XM's commitment to commercial-free music while noting that XM still had the most commercial-free music and that more commercial-free music channels will be added {{in the near future}} to ensure that XM will still have more commercial-free music than competitor Sirius Satellite Radio. On April 17, 2006, XM launched US Country (XM17), Flight 26 (XM26), XM Hitlist (XM30) and Escape (XM78) to provide commercial free music in the formats of the Clear Channel programmed music channels which were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> airing commercials. In response, Sirius has advertised that they are the only satellite radio provider that has 100% commercial-free music channels.

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1899, Kočić {{enrolled}} into the University of Vienna's Department of Slavistics, and began writing prose. His first short story appeared in the publication Bosanska vila (Bosnian Fairy) in 1899. Soon, Kočić began taking part in South Slavic student demonstrations on campus, demanding {{freedom of the press}} and assembly in Bosnia. Despite living in the city and being well educated, Kočić took up the cause of the Bosnian Serb peasants. Most peasants were kmets, or serfs, and did not own the land they tilled. Though they were no longer legally referred to as serfs from 1878 onwards, the kmets farmland remained the property of the Muslim landowning class, which emerged from the Ottoman withdrawal largely unscathed. Kočić helped produce memoranda outlining the protesters' demands, which attracted the attention of the Austro-Hungarian authorities. Kočić understood that his political views would attract the ire of the Austro-Hungarians and potentially jeopardize his career, as demonstrated in a letter he wrote Milka in 1901: [...] "I shall spend perhaps the greater part of my life in jails and prisons, because all us students are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> a struggle against the , who plunder our nation, deprive it of its freedom, and destroy its happiness." ...|$|E

Comb sort compares elements separated by large gaps, and can move turtles extremely quickly before proceeding to smaller and smaller gaps to smooth out the list. Its average speed is comparable to faster algorithms like quicksort.|$|R
