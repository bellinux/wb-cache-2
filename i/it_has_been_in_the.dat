5|$|The {{rotational}} {{axis of the}} Moon lies within Shackleton, only a few kilometers from its center. The crater is 21km in diameter and 4.2km deep. From the Earth, it is viewed edge-on in a region of rough, cratered terrain. It is located within the South Pole-Aitken basin on a massif. The rim is slightly raised about the surrounding surface and it has an outer rampart that has been only lightly impacted. No significant craters intersect the rim, and it is sloped about 1.5° toward the direction 50–90° from the Earth. The age of the crater is about 3.6billion years and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proximity of the south lunar pole {{for at least the}} last two billion years.|$|E

25|$|From 1950, India ran {{continued}} {{trade deficits}} that increased in magnitude in the 1960s. Furthermore, the Government of India had a budget deficit problem {{and could not}} borrow money from abroad or from the private corporate sector, due to that sector's negative savings rate. As a result, the government issued bonds to the RBI, which increased the money supply, leading to inflation. In 1966, foreign aid, which had hitherto been {{a key factor in}} preventing devaluation of the rupee, was finally cut off and India was told it had to liberalise its restrictions on trade before foreign aid would again materialise. The response was the politically unpopular step of devaluation accompanied by liberalisation. Furthermore, The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 led the US and other countries friendly towards Pakistan to withdraw foreign aid to India, which necessitated more devaluation. Defense spending in 1965/1966 was 24.06% of total expenditure, the highest <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> period from 1965 to 1989 (Foundations, pp 195). Another factor leading to devaluation was the drought of 1965/1966 which resulted in a sharp rise in prices.|$|E

500|$|Gawsworth Old Hall is a GradeI listed {{country house}} {{in the village of}} Gawsworth, Cheshire, England. [...] It is a timber-framed {{house in the}} Cheshire {{black-and-white}} style. [...] The present house was built between 1480 and 1600, replacing an earlier Norman house. [...] It was probably built as a courtyard house enclosing a quadrangle, but much of it has been demolished, leaving the house with a U-shaped plan. [...] The present hall was owned originally by the Fitton family, and later by the Gerards, and then the Stanhopes. Since the 1930s <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> possession of the Richards family. [...] Raymond Richards collected a number of items from other historic buildings and incorporated them into the hall.|$|E

It has been described as [...] "the one surviving royal magnificence of the International Gothic age"; and according to Thomas Hoving, former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, [...] "of all the princely jewels and gold that have come down to us, this is the most spectacular—and that includes the great royal treasures." ...|$|E
500|$|Needing {{funds to}} pay for his new house and studio in Compton, Surrey, now the Watts Gallery, Watts {{produced}} further copies of Hope for private sale. A small [...] version was sold to a private collector in Manchester at some point between 1886 and 1890, and was exhibited at the Free Picture Exhibition in Canning Town (an annual event organised by Samuel Barnett and Henrietta Barnett in an effort to bring beauty into the lives of the poor) in 1897. It is now in the Iziko South African National Gallery, Cape Town. Another version, in which Watts included a rainbow surrounding the central figure to reduce the bleakness of the image, was bought by Richard Budgett, a widower whose wife had been a great admirer of Watts, and remained in the possession of the family until 1997. Watts gave his initial oil sketch to Frederic Leighton; <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> collection of the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool since 1923.

500|$|Taxon is the {{bi-monthly}} {{journal of}} the IAPT. The journal, which was initiated in 1951, publishes original papers and reviews dealing with systematic botany in the broadest sense. Preference is given to integrative papers combining the results of modern analysis with their consequences for classification. Taxon also contains matters related to botanical nomenclature, and is the medium for the publication of both proposals to conserve or reject names and proposals to amend the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN). Publication of such matters in Taxon satisfies the required submission to the General Committee. The journal also contains sections devoted to the International Organisation of Plant Biosystematics, reviews and notices of books and other publications, and news {{in the world of}} plant systematics. [...] Although the journal is [...] "devoted to systematic and evolutionary biology with emphasis on botany", <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past criticized for focusing overly on nomenclature and less on the principles and advancements made in the field of plant systematics.|$|E
