50|$|Res nullius (lit: nobody's thing) (also: Derelictio and Res derelictae is a Latin term {{derived from}} private Roman law whereby res (an {{object in the}} legal sense, {{anything}} that can be owned, even a slave, but not a subject in law such as a citizen nor land) is not yet the object of rights of any specific subject. Such items are considered ownerless property and are free to be acquired by means of occupatio. Examples of res nullius in the socio-economic sphere are wild animals (ferae naturae) or abandoned property (res derelictae). Finding can also be a means of occupation (i.e. vesting ownership), since a thing completely lost or abandoned is res nullius, and therefore belonged to the <b>first</b> <b>taker.</b> Specific legislation may be made, e.g. for beachcombing.|$|E
50|$|Celtic faced First Division Livingston at Celtic Park {{in their}} first match, a {{comfortable}} 4-0 victory was secured with goals from Glenn Loovens, Georgios Samaras and Scott Brown. Loovens headed into the net from a cross by Paul Caddis, Samaras added the second with a header from Loovens cross shortly after the hour. Brown added the third with a lob before Samaras got his second from the penalty spot, after Dave MacKay fouled Shaun Maloney in the penalty area. Celtic then travelled to Rugby Park to play Kilmarnock, Scott McDonald scored the opener after 10 minutes with a header, the matches first effort on goal from either side, Shunsuke Nakamura scored the second with a free-kick. Aiden McGeady ended the scoring from a Scott Brown pass, just 3 minutes after Danny Invincibile had given Kilmarnock a chance. The previous season's losing finalists Dundee United were Celtic's opponents in the Semi-final at Hampden, The match ended goalless after extra time and so was decided by a penalty shootout. An astonishing climax ensued with all 10 penalties being scored before going to sudden death. Lee Wilkie; who had missed the penalty in the previous season's final which allowed Rangers to win the cup, missed United's ninth penalty, Glenn Loovens therefore {{had a chance to}} win the match but could not score either. Another two penalties scored and it was goalkeeper time, Łukasz Załuska who would join Celtic the following season scored his and Artur Boruc did likewise, It was back to the <b>first</b> <b>taker</b> Willo Flood, who would join Celtic shortly after this match, could not convert and this time Celtic did take their chance to go through with Scott McDonald scoring the winning penalty.|$|E

40|$|Item {{response}} times can provide valuable information {{for assessing the}} degree to which an item pool has been compromised. Advance knowledge will tend to decrease the amount of time an examinee spends on the item. Increased advance knowledge should result in higher accuracy for rapid responses. We propose to conduct a study to explore NCLEX data for evidence of shifts in response time distributions and accuracy of rapid responses. We will compare pilot test data to data from a single, later time point using three sets of candidates: 10, 000 US-educated <b>first</b> time test <b>takers,</b> 10, 000 non-US educated <b>first</b> time test <b>takers,</b> and 10, 000 non <b>first</b> time test <b>takers.</b> Item responses, item identifiers, final score, and item {{response times}} will be needed for each candidate. Item responses that show rapid correct responding will be identified and accumulated. For any items for which rapid responding is more common that anticipated, the item will be checked against other item characteristics from field test results. The goal is to develop a procedure that measurement practitioners can use to assess {{the degree to which}} advance knowledge has compromised their CAT pools. The NCLEX program can then make more effective decision...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{challenges}} a foundational assumption about {{eminent domain}} - namely, that owners are systematically undercompensated because they receive only {{fair market value}} for their property. The Article shows that, in fact, scholars have overstated the undercompensation problem because they {{have focused on the}} compensation required by the Constitution, rather than on the actual mechanics of eminent domain. The Article examines three ways that Takers (i. e., non-judicial actors in the eminent domain process) minimize undercompensation. <b>First,</b> <b>Takers</b> may avoid taking high-subjective-value properties. Second, Takers frequently must pay more compensation in the form of relocation assistance. Third, Takers and property owners may voluntarily settle on above-market compensation during pre-condemnation negotiations. The Article concludes by reflecting upon current efforts to reform eminent domain legislatively. Prominent legal scholars recently have proposed compensation-based reforms as an alternative to constraints on the use of eminent domain. The final Part rejects this suggestion, arguing that there are two problems, unique to takings raising public use questions, that more money cannot solve: First, high compensation levels may undermine political resistance to questionable projects; second, private takings may generate non-instrumental harms that will persist even as compensation increases...|$|R

40|$|Financial {{markets are}} {{nowadays}} {{more important than}} ever. Financial crisis of the previous decade demonstrated their power to influence stability of the whole economy. Since the consensus blames weak regulation and considers the only solution to be its extension, this thesis tries to provide the proof of existence of other options. The focus is firstly aimed at the weaknesses of the fractional reserve banking, which does not follow the basic legal principles of a deposit contract. This practice results in price fluctuations and favoritism of <b>first</b> <b>takers</b> of newly created money. Moreover, the thesis develops a new method of analysis, which emphasizes the application of preferences in exchanges. Important outcome of this method is the demonstration that the public {{does not have to}} always prefer the most evolved form of institution. All institutions within commercial banks are then analyzed with the use of this method and the thesis shows where preference channels are being interfered with. This analysis also reveals another outcome of fractional reserve banking, which is that the newly created money is only used according to the preferences of commercial bankers. We suggest that circumvention of the true nature of a deposit contract leads to a similar outcome in loan banking, where funds gathered by loan [...] ...|$|R
