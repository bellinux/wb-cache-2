40|$|Abstract. The {{distribution}} of subpopulations of lymphocytes in lymph nodes and tumors from cattle with <b>enzootic</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>leukosis</b> (<b>EBL)</b> was examined by immunohistochemistry using {{a panel of}} monclonal antibodies against leukocyte differentiation molecules of EBL. The lesions in lymph nodes could be divided into three types based {{on the extent of}} infiltration and proliferation of neoplastic cells with provirus and differential expression of leukocyte differentiation molecules. The number of B-B 2 +, sIgM+ cells was reduced in frequency in follicles during the neoplastic cell proliferation. CD 4 - and CD 8 -positive a/ @ T cells and y/ 6 T cells positive for WC 1 (workshop cluster designation) were also reduced in frequency in areas infiltrated with neoplastic cells. Almost all neoplastic cells were B-B 2 - and IgM-positive. However, there were a few B-B 2 - and/or IgM-negative cells or cells stained faintly in all cases. WCI + cells were not observed in tumor tissues. However, CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells were observed throughout tumor tissues, suggesting a role for these cells in tumor immunity.

We used a partial-budget model, and incorporated risk and sensitivity analyses to identify the effects of uncertainty on costs. Total annual costs for an average, infected, 50 cow herd were: JD$ 2472; BVD$ 2421; neosporosis $ 2304; EBL$ 806. The stochastic nature of the proportion of infected herds and prevalence of infection within a herd were used to estimate probability distributions for these ex post costs. For all diseases, these distributions were right skewed. A sensitivity analysis showed the largest effect on costs was due to milk yield effects.

It proved to be a very sensitive technique, since it rapidly revealed the presence of the provirus, frequently at 2 weeks postinoculation and using a two-round procedure of nested PCR taking only 3 hours. Additionally, the primers used flanked a portion of the viral genome often employed to differentiate BLV type applying BamHI digestion.

However, this approach has shortcomings in the time taken to detect anti-BLV antibodies (three to four weeks after infection), and in the failure to detect antibodies in some animals. Clearly a technique such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which directly detects the presence of viral DNA, has advantages over methods designed to measure host antibodies. The use of PCR for the detection of proviral DNA in an affected DNA sample with as little as 10 μg of host DNA using agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining is described here. It was possible to improve the sensitivity of this assay by using hybridisation analysis with a BLV gene probe.

A slight insignificant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity and unchanged levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, calcium, magnesium, and TAS were demonstrated in EBL cows. As the TAS and vitamin C levels remained unchanged in EBL cows, it may be suggested that ruminants may compensate for the impaired oxidative/antioxidative balance. The results obtained also indicate that BLV may suppress AST and Cp synthesis or secretion in the liver through an unknown mechanism.

Lymphocyte counts were also measured in both BLV positive and negative groups. Telomerase activity was detected in all BLV infected animals with persistent lymphocytosis (PL), especially in older individuals. This study revealed that the cells undergo the natural telomerase shortening even in the presence of an existing viral infection. We also show that viral infection, especially during the PL phase of the disease, increases telomerase activity. A statistically significant interaction between age and viral infection was observed for telomere shortening during BLV infection. Older animals with BLV infection, especially those with persistent lymphocytosis or visible tumors, exhibited a sharp increase in telomerase activity. This study demonstrates that there is a significant interaction between BLV infection and telomerase up-regulation and lymphocytosis.

Every herd had a number of animals seropositive for BoHV- 1. From 278 analyzed samples, 54. 68 % (152 / 278) were responsive to BoHV- 1, 69. 70 % (194 / 278) to BVDV- 1, and 34. 33 % (97 / 278) to EBLV. The statistical analysis showed significant difference (á = 0. 01) in infection occurrence according to the type of herd and animal age. Dairy cattle were more sensitive to BoHV- 1 (81. 31 %) and to EBLV (49. 53 %), while in beef cattle the most frequent was BVDV- 1 (94. 74 %). Age was a risk factor only for BoHV- 1 and EBLV, the results showed that the older animals were more susceptible. The association analysis also indicated that among BVDV- 1 and/or EBLV infected herds the probability of finding BoHV- 1 is higher than among herds where these two infections do not occur...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Although several {{attempts}} have been made to control <b>enzootic</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>leukosis</b> (<b>EBL)</b> at the local level, a nationwide control program has not been implemented in Japan, except for passive surveillance. Effective control of EBL requires that the transmission routes of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection should be identified and intercepted based on scientific evidence. In this cross-sectional study, we examined the risk factors associated with within-herd transmission of BLV on infected dairy farms in Japan. Blood samples taken from 30 randomly selected adult cows at each of 139 dairy farms were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Information on herd management was collected using a structured questionnaire. Results Infected farms were defined as those with more than one ELISA-positive animal and accounted for 110 (79. 1 %) of the 139 farms in the study. Completed questionnaires obtained from 90 of these 110 farms were used for statistical analysis. Seroprevalence, which was defined as the proportions of animals that tested positive out of all animals tested on the farm, was 17. 1 %, 48. 1 %, and 68. 5 % for the 25 th, 50 th, and 75 th percentiles, respectively. A mixed logistic regression analysis implicated a loose housing system, dehorning, and a large number of horseflies in summer as risk factors (coefficient = 0. 71, 1. 11, and 0. 82; p = 0. 03, Conclusion Control of EBL in infected dairy farms in Japan will be improved by focusing particularly on these risk and protective factors. </p...|$|E
40|$|Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the {{etiologic}} agent of <b>enzootic</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>leukosis.</b> We previously identified several mutants of the BLV Tax protein with {{an ability to}} transactivate transcription via the BLV enhancer that is significantly {{greater than that of}} the wild-type Tax protein. Moreover, the mutant proteins also activated other viral enhancers, such as the enhancer of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, which cannot be activated by wild-type BLV Tax. In this study, we demonstrated that the mutant proteins but not wild-type protein activate the upstream sequence of the human c-fos gene, which contains two major cis-acting elements, the CArG box and cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE) motif. The mutant protein also strongly increased levels of endogenous c-fos mRNA in both human and bovine cell lines. On the other hand, the wild-type Tax protein has no activity to activate the expression of human c-fos, indicating that wild-type BLV Tax might discriminate between human and bovine c-fos promoter sequences. Deletion and point-mutational analysis of the cis-acting elements revealed that both the CArG box and the CRE motif were indispensable for the activation of c-fos by the mutant BLV Tax protein. Our results suggest that the mutant BLV Tax proteins might not only have the ability to enhance the production of virus particles but might also have increased ability to induce leukemia...|$|R
40|$|<b>Enzootic</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>leukosis</b> is a {{contagious}} disease of cattle {{caused by the}} retrovirus, bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and {{is the most common}} cause of malignant neoplasm in cattle. In order to facilitate surveillance of this disease in dairy herds, we developed a method to combine ELISA of milk collected during routine production testing with a prescribed sampling of cows that is independent of the proportion of cows within each lactation. In 113 Michigan dairy herds, milk samples from ten cows in each of the 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, and ≥ 4 th lactations were analyzed for anti-Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) antibodies by milk ELISA. For each herd, a BLV herd profile (BHP) was calculated as the simple average of the percent of BLV-positive cows within each of the four lactation groups. The mean BHP for all herds was 32. 8 %, with means of 18. 5, 28. 8, 39. 2, and 44. 8 % of 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, and ≥ 4 th lactation animals infected, respectively. In eight herds, we determined the correlation between the BHP, and true herd prevalence by testing the entire lactating herd (r = 0. 988, P < 0. 0001). The BHP allows discrimination of lactation-specific BLV prevalence within a dairy herd, to help identify risk factors and management plans that may be important in transmission of BLV...|$|R
