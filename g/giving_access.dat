In this paper, it is shown how to decide optimal linear codes (i. e., with the biggest information rate) realizing a <b>given</b> <b>access</b> structure over finite fields. It amounts to solving a system of quadratic equations constructed from the <b>given</b> <b>access</b> structure and the corresponding adversary structure. The system becomes a linear system for binary codes. An algorithm is also given for finding the adversary structure for any <b>given</b> <b>access</b> structure.

5|$|The Bridgewater Canal was {{extended}} from Worsley {{to the middle}} of Leigh in 1795. In 1819 the fifth Leeds and Liverpool Canal Act was passed for the construction of the Leigh Branch and by 1820 the Leigh branch canal was cut from the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Poolstock, Wigan to meet the Bridgewater at Leigh Bridge, <b>giving</b> <b>access</b> from Leigh to all parts of Lancashire, Yorkshire and the Midlands.|$|E
5|$|Chalukyan temples {{fall into}} two {{categories}} – the first being temples with a common mantapa (a colonnaded hall) and two shrines (known as dvikuta), and the second being temples with one mantapa and a single shrine (ekakuta). Both kinds of temples have two or more entrances <b>giving</b> <b>access</b> to the main hall. This format differs from both the designs of the northern Indian temples, which have a small closed mantapa leading to the shrine and the southern Indian temples which generally have a large, open, columned mantapa.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} central London Underground stations, Holborn was modernised {{in the early}} 1930s to replace the lifts with escalators. The station frontages on Kingsway and High Holborn were {{partially}} reconstructed to modernist designs by Charles Holden with the granite elements replaced with plain Portland stone façades perforated with glazed screens. The lifts were removed and a spacious new ticket hall was provided <b>giving</b> <b>access</b> to a bank of four escalators down to an intermediate concourse for the Central line platforms. A second bank of three escalators continues down to the Piccadilly line platforms.|$|E

5|$|York {{is linked}} to Manchester Airport by an hourly direct TransPennine Express train, <b>giving</b> <b>access</b> to the {{principal}} airport serving the north of England, with connections to many destinations in Europe, North America, Africa, and Asia. Leeds Bradford Airport is closer to York but the hourly York Air Coach service operated by First York was withdrawn as of April 2009. Leeds Bradford Airport provides connections to most major European and North African airports as well as Pakistan and New York City.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the more}} northerly (Bakerloo) part of the station is via the {{original}} building, while the exit is via a new extension next to Skipton House. Between the entrance and two shops is the entrance to South London House, an office block above the station. The BS station building remains much as originally constructed and is a typical Leslie Green structure. The main alteration is a modern glass-sided and glass-topped flat-roofed extension abutting the original western elevation, <b>giving</b> <b>access</b> to three of the six arches. These arches, in a classic deep-red faience style, formed the original perimeter: two are infilled with street-facing shops. As the station also functions as a drivers' depot, London Underground uses the offices above the station for administration and drivers' accommodation.|$|E
5|$|South Kensington is a London Underground {{station in}} the {{district}} of Kensington, south west London. It is served by the District, Circle and Piccadilly lines. On the District and Circle lines, the station is between Gloucester Road and Sloane Square, and on the Piccadilly line, it is between Gloucester Road and Knightsbridge. It is in Travelcard Zone 1. The main station entrance is located at the junction of Old Brompton Road (A3218), Thurloe Place, Harrington Road, Onslow Place and Pelham Street. Subsidiary entrances are located in Exhibition Road <b>giving</b> <b>access</b> by pedestrian tunnel to the Natural History, Science and Victoria and Albert Museums. Also close by are the Royal Albert Hall, Imperial College London, the Royal College of Music, the London branch of the Goethe-Institut and the Ismaili Centre.|$|E

5|$|The plan {{of attack}} was for the British raiding force to sink two {{obsolete}} cruisers in the canal mouth at Ostend and three at Zeebrugge, thus preventing raiding ships leaving Bruges. The Ostend canal was the smaller and narrower of the two channels <b>giving</b> <b>access</b> to Bruges and so was considered a secondary target behind the Zeebrugge Raid. Consequently, fewer resources were provided to the force assaulting Ostend. While the attack at Zeebrugge garnered some limited success, the assault on Ostend was a complete failure. The German marines who defended the port had taken careful preparations and drove the British assault ships astray, forcing the abortion of the operation at the final stage.|$|E
5|$|Fates was {{announced}} for all regions via a Nintendo Direct broadcast in January 2015. It {{was announced}} in Japan as Fire Emblem if. Its English title was revealed during Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015. Fates was released in multiple versions. Birthright and Conquest both received a physical release on June 25, 2015 in Japan, which was announced for a 2016 release in the west. Players who purchase a physical copy of either version can download the other version as DLC for a smaller price. Revelation was released exclusively as downloadable content on July 9, {{two weeks after the}} physical release of Fates. In addition to the standard releases was a special edition <b>giving</b> <b>access</b> to Conquest, Birthright and Revelation. The western release also follows the release pattern used in Japan. In North America, the physical versions were released first in February, with the third storyline coming later as DLC in March. In Europe, the physical editions were released on May 20, with Revelation following as DLC on June 9. A special edition, containing all three storylines and an art book, was made available in both regions alongside the initial physical releases. In Australia, the physical versions launched on May 21, while Revelation launched on June 10.|$|E
5|$|Ground {{was broken}} for the highway project in April 2006, with major {{construction}} beginning in May. Caltrans estimated completion in late 2009 for {{the completion of}} the four-lane expressway, including a new directional interchange at each end, at which State Route 70 and State Route 99 will exit and enter {{to the right of the}} main Oroville-Chico movement. Most access was closed, with Shippee Road providing the sole at-grade crossing of the expressway, and an overcrossing near State Route 70 <b>giving</b> <b>access</b> to local property. Shippee Road was relocated to the southeast, allowing for the future construction of an interchange. In addition, State Route 70 was relocated to the west between SR 149 and State Route 191, and local access on State Route 99 between SR 149 and the Durham Dayton Highway interchange was replaced by frontage roads. The entire project was completed in November 2008, at a cost of $125 million.|$|E
40|$|We posit that {{household}} decision-making over fertility {{is characterized}} by moral hazard {{due to the fact}} that most contraception can only be perfectly observed by the woman. Using an experiment in Zambia that varied whether women were <b>given</b> <b>access</b> to contraceptives alone or with their husbands, we find that women <b>given</b> <b>access</b> with their husbands were 19 % less likely to seek family planning services, 25 % less likely to use concealable contraception, and 27 % more likely to give birth. However, women <b>given</b> <b>access</b> to contraception alone report a lower subjective well-being, suggesting a psychosocial cost of making contraceptives more concealable...|$|R

5|$|The {{station at}} Chalfont Road was built with almost all {{facilities}} {{on the up}} side (the London-bound platform). As Chalfont St Giles, the largest nearby settlement, {{was on the other}} side of the tracks, most passengers travelling to and from the station were obliged to take a lengthy detour from the single exit. A footpath across the tracks was added in 1925, but an approach road <b>giving</b> <b>access</b> to the station from the southern side of the railway line was not built until 1933. The station had three platforms; one platform in each direction on the London–Aylesbury line, and a bay platform alongside the up platform for trains to Chesham. A run-around loop was built to allow locomotives reversing in the bay platform always to be at the front of their trains. It was built outside the station, meaning locomotives reversing on the Chesham line were obliged to push their trains out of the station before performing the manoeuvre.|$|E
