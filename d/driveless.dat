40|$|In {{the last}} few years the number of {{applications}} of autonomous mobile robots to outdoor and off-road tasks, like border surveillance and monitoring, search and rescue, agriculture, <b>driveless</b> mobility has been rapidly increasing. Among the huge number of functionalities that are required to make a vehicle an autonomous robot, localisation, path planning and trajectory tracking are the most important. This paper proposes a novel approach to solve the trajectory tracking problem of an Ackermann steering vehicle. A multi-body dynamic model of the vehicle is proposed as a mean to tune and validate the tracking controller. The proposal is supported by an experimental validation, that shows the effectiveness of the trajectory tracking controller and its performance in comparison with the accuracy of the localisation algorithm...|$|E
40|$|There {{the study}} objects are the rotary working heads, the {{machines}} of <b>driveless</b> and drive types for the surface cultivation of soil. The purposes are to substantiate by engineering, {{to develop and}} to introduce the set of rotary machines of new generation for the surface cultivation of soil with the high technical-an-economic and agrotechnical indicators. The general mechainsms of action of rotary working heads on the soil have been ascertained. The rational variables and the parts of surface cultivation process of soil, the mechanization aids for its execution have been substantiated. The set of rotary machines for the surface cultivation of soil with the decreased energy consumption, with the decreased material consumption and with risen output has been developed and has been introduced. FNSh- 1. 5 (2) soil cutters, BRK- 6, 2 KRVK- 3, PBL- 10 rotary implements, RVU- 6 and AKP- 6 combined assemblies are in use. The set of rotary machines provides for the decrease of energy consumption by 45 - 50 %, of material consumption 1, 5 - 2 times, the increase of labour intensiveness by 35 - 40 %Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|Self-driving {{cars are}} not a new concept. Indeed, a working model of an {{automated}} highway was the hit of the General Motors pavilion at the 1939 World's Fair in New York City. During the late 1950 s and 1960 s, researchers at General Motors went on to refine various <b>driveless</b> vehicles. They showed, for example, how robotic trucks could work in open-pit mines. Although these early attempts at automation were valuable research exercises, the results proved too crude to be truly workable. Yet by the late 1980 s, advances in microprocessors, wireless communications and various electronic sensors prompted many people to rethink the idea of automated highways. One group, which originally called itself Mobility 2000, convened in 1988 to consider the possibilities. It subsequently formed the Intelligent Vehicle Highway Society of America (later named the Intelligent Transportation Society of America), which now has more than 1000 organizations as members. Its mission is to foster the introduction of various 'intelligent' transportation systems, including automated highways', Rillings (1997). In 1997, a prototype system for an automated highway on a stretch of the California freeway showed how automation might allow existing highways to accommodate {{a larger number of}} vehicles, while ensuring a higher degree of safety. The developers target the year 2002 for a commercial introduction of the system. (orig.)

30|$|For the WC 55 Y shield hauler, {{a moving}} speed brake was developed, which {{integrates}} a planetary speed retarder {{and a large}} torque wetted multi-disc safe brake. Traditional brake concentrates on the high-speed end of wheel-side retarder, and is small in dimension. However, under a larger braking torque and repeated braking, the system generates large amount of heat and consistently fails. The working condition of the shield hauler is harsh. In the aspect of <b>driveless</b> axle hydraulic-driven design, {{there have been no}} successful braking studies anywhere in the world. Fully enclosed, high torque and large brake power, small in size, and high efficiency heat dissipation are the difficulties in the study. Meanwhile, the road underground is potholed, thus during the movement of heavy-loaded vehicles, the wheel-side retarder will withstand a greater shock load, and therefore must have enough strength. Otherwise, it will cause failures in the retarder’s bearing, such as broken parts. In response to these technical bottlenecks, a “modular integrated technology” was used to design a new planetary gear of wetted multiple-disc brake. Also, an integrated motor-cartridge wheel drive and brake retarder was invented. It is a wheel-side planetary retarder, and integrates all brake functions. The brake was designed as a fully closed wetted-type multi-disc brake with spring braking and hydraulic release. Through the spline, friction tablets and steel tablets are coupled with fixed parts and turned parts respectively. Through the motor input, retarder part input torque, delivered via a two level planetary deceleration device, the torque will be transmitted to the wheels. The brake cavity and retarder cavity are completely insulated by a pair of high reliable floating seals to avoid the interference of two different functions. The braking torque of the integrated brake-retarder is greater than 60, 000  N m, thermal equilibrium temperature is less than 90 C° under long term braking, and the average life of the friction disc is greater than 5000  h. Furthermore, it is safe, reliable, has good pollution resistance, and increases operational safety.|$|E
