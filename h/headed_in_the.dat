5|$|Shortly after departing Bodrum, UB-14 {{had just}} cleared the Greek island of Kos and {{was off the}} nearby island of Kandeloussa when von Heimburg sighted several {{potential}} victims. The first ship seen was the British hospital ship , headed to Alexandria from the Dardanelles. Von Heimburg, seeing the properly identified hospital ship, allowed Soudan to pass unmolested. The next ship was not so lucky, however. It was the unescorted , a Canadian ocean liner pressed into troopship duties. Royal Edward was <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction from Soudan: from Alexandria to the Dardanelles with reinforcements for the British 29th Infantry and a small group with the Royal Army Medical Corps, {{all of whom were}} destined for Gallipoli. Von Heimburg launched one of his two torpedoes from about a mile (2km) away and hit Royal Edward in the stern; the ship sank stern-first in six minutes, with a large loss of life. Soudan and several other ships were able to rescue nearly 700 men, but over 900 died. Royal Edward, at , was also among the largest ships hit by U-boats during the war.

Despite encountering resistance from a government force that held out until the afternoon, Sulayman's well-coordinated troops successfully occupied the city.

25|$|Lee next {{answered}} {{a question about}} homosexuality at a Young PAP meeting in 2007.

Chen referred to a controversial play about Singaporean porn actress Annabel Chong, which explored pornography and alternative sexuality. Lee was then asked if he believed homosexuality {{was a product of}} nature or nurture. He replied that he had asked doctors about homosexuality and had been told that it was caused by a genetic random transmission of genes.|$|E

25|$|The {{run for the}} Torres Strait {{was going}} without {{incident}} until an unknown destroyer and freighter were spotted on the 17th <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction and then on 18 February Don Isidro was attacked twice by a Japanese bomber, though without damage. That attack was decisive in the captain's decision to turn toward the friendly port of Darwin. On {{the morning of the}} 19th seven Japanese fighters strafed the ship while she was about 25 miles north of Bathurst Island. This attack holed the ship, destroyed all life boats and rafts and wounded a number of crew and defenders. In early afternoon, at about 1:30 (1330) the ship was again attacked by a single bomber and again escaped bomb damage.|$|E

25|$|DeBellevue {{picked up}} the MiGs on the Phantom's onboard radar and using Combat Tree, {{discovered}} that the MiGs were ten miles behind Olds flight, another flight of MiGCAP fighters returning to base. Ritchie called in the contact to warn Olds flight. Ritchie, concerned that MiGs might be at an altitude above them, made continuous requests for altitude readings to both Disco and Red Crown. He received location, heading, and speed data on the MiGs (now determined to be returning north at high speed to their base) but not altitude as Buick flight closed to within 15 miles of the MiGs. DeBellevue's radar then painted the MiGs dead ahead at 25,000 feet, and Ritchie ordered the flight to light afterburners. DeBellevue warned Ritchie they were closing fast and were in range. About the same time Ritchie saw the MiGs himself <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction.|$|E
25|$|Porter still {{dabbled in}} track racing and in 1963 {{performed}} {{well in the}} individual pursuit at Aldersley Stadium's Easter international meeting, before winning the final 10-mile scratch race. Encouraged, Porter began to consider contesting the national individual pursuit championship. In the meantime, he also raced in the national 25-mile individual time trial championship in Gloucestershire, finishing second. The individual pursuit championship was decided at Fallowfield Stadium; Porter was the fastest qualifier and, although <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{early stages of the}} final, soon eased into the lead to beat Harry Jackson and win his first individual national title. Porter then travelled to the Rocourt velodrome, near Liège in Belgium, for the 1963 world championship, where he reached the semi-final, to be pipped by 0.18 seconds by Belgian Jean Walschaerts for a place in the final. He won the third-place ride-off to take a bronze medal.|$|E
25|$|In a {{game where}} Leeds were {{generally}} {{seen to have}} had the best of the play — with winger Eddie Gray in particular giving David Webb a torrid time — the Yorkshiremen took the lead after 20 minutes when Jack Charlton's downward header from a corner did not bounce in the muddy pitch, defending Chelsea player Eddie McCreadie mis-timed his attempted clearance and the ball rolled over the line. Towards {{the end of the first}} half, Chelsea's Peter Houseman drove a low shot from , which goalkeeper Gary Sprake fumbled, and it, too, rolled over the line for the equaliser. Leeds appeared to have secured the game six minutes from full-time when an Allan Clarke header hit the post and Mick Jones reacted first to put the ball into the net, but two minutes later Ian Hutchinson <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> equaliser from John Hollins' cross. There were no more goals scored during the 30-minute extra time and the two squads took a joint lap of honour.|$|E
