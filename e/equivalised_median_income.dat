The indicators used are the proportion of households in each LSOA whose equivalised household income was below 60 % of the Welsh <b>median</b> <b>equivalised</b> household <b>income</b> in the appropriate year. The adjusted OECD scale was used to calculate equivalised income before (BHC) and after (AHC) housing costs and the results for these two variants are presented together with estimates of the % {{of children who are}} living in 'poor' households in each LSOA...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{changes in}} poverty in Britain since 1997. A poverty level of 60 percent of <b>median</b> <b>equivalised</b> <b>income</b> is used. The first part examines {{the changes that}} occurred between 1996 / 7 and 2000 / 1 {{as shown by the}} Family Resources Survey, on which government estimates of Households Below Average Income are based. There was a small reduction in poverty overall and a larger proportionate fall in child poverty. This fall was attributable in part to increased employment and in part to changes in benefits and tax credits which increased for some, particularly for families on low earnings with children, but fell relative to <b>median</b> <b>incomes</b> for many of those without children and not in employment. The second part assesses policy changes implemented or announced for the period 2000 / 1 to 2003 / 4 by means of a micro-simulation model, POLIMOD, using a sample from the Family Resources Survey. The impact of policy changes is to reduce poverty compared to its prospects under previous policies. But, relative to a poverty level that rises in real terms in step with <b>median</b> <b>incomes,</b> future reductions in poverty are likely to be small. In order to keep on track towards the goal of halving child poverty by 2010, further policy measures will be required. poverty, welfare policy...|$|R
30|$|Poverty is {{computed}} at {{the household}} level: if the household {{equivalised disposable income}} is below the poverty threshold (i.e. the 60  % of the national <b>median</b> <b>equivalised</b> disposable <b>income),</b> all the household members are poor. Coherently, also covariates are computed at the household level. In particular, we control for household-specific and main earner characteristics. The main earner is chosen because it is considered as the most representative of the household economic condition. However, the analyses are carried out at an individual level, for two main reasons. First, the PARP rate is computed as the share of individuals living in such a condition. Since {{we are interested in}} the analyses of the Europe 2020 indicator, as defined by Eurostat, we want to stay {{as close as possible to}} the original definition. Second, longitudinal weighs are provided at the individual level (i.e. they differ among the household members) because they correct for non-response at the individual level. Since all household members have the same characteristics, robust standard errors are provided.|$|R
40|$|Although {{economic}} growth has brought {{significant improvements in}} {{the standard of living}} in the UK over recent decades, there are still individuals living in poverty. Furthermore poverty in the UK is expected to rise. Although monetary poverty has wide ranging impacts such as poor health, low educational attainment and employability and reduced life expectancy, it does not (in the form of a poverty line at 60 % of the <b>median</b> <b>equivalised</b> household <b>income)</b> appear {{to have an impact on}} wellbeing when the threshold was tested. Instead, multidimensional poverty – that purported by the Capabilities Approach – is a more individually relevant measure of poverty. Using a list, developed by Nussbaum, of core capabilities seen as essential for human life, capability measures were taken from the British Household Panel Survey. In analysis, some are found to be significant determinants of wellbeing, individually and in sum. Furthermore, individuals within the dataset experience loss aversion to capabilities. This thesis concludes that poverty measurement should be meaningful at the individual level, and to that aim, the Capabilities Approach provides a richer and more relevant evaluation of what poverty really means...|$|R
30|$|The {{framework}} of Europe 2020, the European Union’s growth {{strategy for the}} decade, shows policymakers’ increasing interest in poverty issues: {{one of the five}} headline targets consists in reducing poverty or social exclusion, by lifting 20 million people out of poverty by 2020 (European Commission 2010). The definition of adequate policies, however, needs to rely not only on a measure of the level of poverty or social exclusion characterising a country but also on a clear knowledge of the underlying processes and trigger factors. For this reason, in the set of indicators used by the European Union (EU) to monitor social inclusion, the at risk of poverty (ARP) rate is complemented by the persistent at risk of poverty (PARP) rate that provides a more detailed picture of how consistently households experience poverty in time (Őzdemir and Ward 2010). According to Eurostat, the ARP is the share of people with an equivalised disposable income below the ARP threshold, which is set at 60  % of the national <b>median</b> <b>equivalised</b> disposable <b>income.</b> The PARP is then defined as the share of individuals at risk of poverty during the current year and at least two out of the three previous ones (Eurostat 2012).|$|R
40|$|The Working for Families (WFF) benefit {{reform package}} was the centrepiece of the 2004 Budget {{announcements}} of the Labour-led coalition government in New Zealand. The package is targeted at low-to-middle-income {{families with dependent}} children. One of its core goals is to improve income adequacy for these families {{as one of the}} key means of reducing child poverty over the next three years. In this regard, it {{is an example of the}} government implementing many of the poverty alleviation strategies outlined in the 2002 Agenda for Children, which committed to eliminating child poverty. This paper gives an account of a modelling and analysis exercise that provides estimates of the likely impact of the WFF reforms on income poverty through to 2007, with a major focus on the impact of the Family Income Assistance (FIA) component of the WFF on child poverty. It uses two internationally recognised poverty thresholds of 50 % and 60 % of the <b>median</b> <b>equivalised</b> <b>income</b> of households. The impact analysis finds that, when the WFF reforms are fully implemented in 2007, child poverty can be expected to have been reduced by the FIA by around 70 % and 30 % respectively at these two thresholds. A distinctive feature of the paper is the extensive sensitivity testing regarding the possible effect on the impact estimates of different assumptions and parameter settings that go into the construction of the poverty measures...|$|R
