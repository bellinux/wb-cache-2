In the present paper are reported the results of VOO cleaning through an enhanced sedimentation plant by hydrocyclone. Treatments have been compared by physical and chemical characterization of VOO both after 48 hours from extraction and after 180 days of shelf-life. The VOO cleaning by the enhanced sedimentation plant showed the capability to increase both processing capacity and VOO quality with respect to both VOO by vertical <b>disc</b> <b>stack</b> centrifuge and by natural sedimentation plant.

Research limitations/implications: It is important to provide a model functionality allowing for calculation of disc stacks supported by a coil spring and stack settings having the opening limiter. <b>Disc</b> <b>stack</b> stress and opening characteristics vs. applied pressure may be determined with simplified analytically derived model and full 2 D model including almost all significant forces and moments in a stack of circular plates.

40|$|Olive oil {{extraction}} is mainly carried out using continuous extraction by decanter centrifuge with efficiency of approximately 80 – 90 %. After centrifugal extraction, olive oil is generally cleaned using a vertical <b>disc</b> <b>stack</b> centrifuge separator, which {{is suspected of}} being the major cause of decreased final olive oil quality. Experiments were carried out at industrial scale to compare the olive oil properties after improved processes of sedimentation (Sedoil) or centrifugation (Cenoil) with respect to raw olive oil obtained at the decanter exit (Control). Peroxide, polyphenol, chlorophyll, carotenoid, turbidity and K 232 average values were significantly different between Sedoil and Cenoil, which confirmed {{that the use of}} <b>disc</b> <b>stack</b> centrifuges represents an important source of oxidative reactions. Analysis showed that storage time dramatically affects the oxidation level of the olive oil. All parameters used to monitor the oxidation level (i. e., free acidity, peroxide value and K 232) increased after 180 d of storage, and the content of natural antioxidants and pigments decreased as expected. The residual presence of water during long-term storage represented the most important source of oxidation, and an effective cleaning operation is necessary to preserve oil quality during its storage life. The analyses performed using 1 H and 13 C NMR showed that Sedoil was more similar in composition to Control than to Cenoil.

40|$|Cryogenic Solid Propellant (CSP) -technology {{is a new}} {{approach}} to develop more powerful rocket motors. CSPs include the advantages of classical solid propellants to save weight {{as well as those of}} a high energy content and safety of modern liquid propellants. The charges consist of liquid and/or gaseous fuels and oxidizers, both frozen. Two main versions of CSP-technology can be realised: 1. Mono-CSPs show the burning behavior of solid propellants. Experiments with mono-CSPs have been carried out under inert pressure conditions in a window bomb. Mono-CSPs have a stable burning behavior with a constant regression rate which follows the Vieille's law under varying pressure conditions. 2. The advantage of high safety is obtained by assembling oxidizer and fuel in sandwich configurations. The grain geometry governs the burning behavior. Such systems can be externally controlled, e. g. by the heat from a gas generator or they can work self-sustained. A Rod-in-Matrix burner shows self-sustained combustion in an inert pressure atmosphere with overall burning rates in a similar range as solid rocket propellants which obey also a Vieille-like pressure law. <b>Disc</b> <b>stack</b> burners have also been investigated, the combustion of which is strongly dependent on the disc thickness.

40|$|Selective isoelectric whey protein {{precipitation}} and aggregation {{is carried}} out at laboratory scale in a standard configuration batch agitation vessel. Geometric scale-up of this operation is implemented {{on the basis of}} constant impeller power input per unit volume and subsequent clarification is achieved by high speed disc-stack centrifugation. Particle size and fractal geometry are important in achieving efficient separation while aggregates need to be strong enough to resist the more extreme levels of shear that are encountered during processing, for example through pumps, valves and at the centrifuge inlet zone. This study investigates how impeller agitation intensity and ageing time affect aggregate size, strength, fractal dimension and hindered settling rate at laboratory scale in order to determine conditions conducive for improved separation. Particle strength is measured by observing the effects of subjecting aggregates to moderate and high levels of process shear in a capillary rig and through a partially open ball-valve respectively. The protein precipitate yield is also investigated with respect to ageing time and impeller agitation intensity. A pilot scale study is undertaken to investigate scale-up and how agitation vessel shear affects centrifugal separation efficiency. Laboratory scale studies show that precipitates subject to higher impeller shear-rates during the addition of the precipitation agent are smaller but more compact than those subject to lower impeller agitation and are better able to resist turbulent breakage. They are thus more likely to provide a better feed for more efficient centrifugal separation. Protein precipitation yield improves significantly with ageing, and 50 minutes of ageing is required to obtain a 70 - 80 % yield of α-lactalbumin. Geometric scale-up of the agitation vessel at constant power per unit volume results in aggregates of broadly similar size exhibiting similar trends but with some differences due to the absence of dynamic similarity due to longer circulation time and higher tip speed in the larger vessel. <b>Disc</b> <b>stack</b> centrifuge clarification efficiency curves show aggregates formed at higher shear-rates separate more efficiently, in accordance with laboratory scale projections.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was defined by a poorly characterised filtration train employed to clarify culture broth containing monoclonal antibodies secreted by GS-NSO cells: the filtration train blinded unpredictably and the ability of the positively charged filters to adsorb DNA from process material was unknown. To direct the development of an assay to quantify the ability of depth filters to adsorb DNA, the molecular weight of DNA from a large-scale, fed-batch, mammalian cell culture vessel was evaluated as process material passed through the initial stages of the purification scheme. High molecular weight DNA was substantially cleared from the broth after passage through a <b>disc</b> <b>stack</b> centrifuge and the remaining low molecular weight DNA was largely unaffected by passage through a series of depth filters and a sterilising grade membrane. Removal of high molecular weight DNA was shown to be coupled with clarification of the process stream. The DNA from cell culture supernatant showed a pattern of internucleosomal cleavage of chromatin when fractionated by electrophoresis but the presence of both necrotic and apoptotic cells throughout the fermentation meant that the origin of the fragmented DNA could not be unequivocally determined. An intercalating fluorochrome, PicoGreen, was elected for development of a suitable DNA assay because of its ability to respond to low molecular weight DNA. It was assessed for its ability to determine the concentration of DNA in clarified mammalian cell culture broths containing pertinent monoclonal antibodies. Fluorescent signal suppression was ameliorated by sample dilution or by performing the assay above the pI of secreted IgG. The source of fluorescence in clarified culture broth was validated by incubation with RNase A and DNase I. At least 89. 0 % of fluorescence was attributable to nucleic acid and pre-digestion with RNase A was shown to be a requirement for successful quantification of DNA in such samples. Application of the fluorescence based assay resulted in characterisation of the physical parameters governing adsorption of DNA by various positively charged depth filters and membranes in test solutions and the DNA adsorption profile of the manufacturing scale filtration train. Buffers that reduced or neutralised the depth filter or membrane charge, and those that impeded hydrophobic interactions were shown to affect their operational capacity, demonstrating that DNA was adsorbed by a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Production-scale centrifugation of harvest broth containing therapeutic protein resulted in the reduction of total DNA in the process stream from 79. 8 μg m 1 - 1 to 9. 3 μg m 1 - 1 whereas the concentration of DNA in the supernatant of pre-and post-filtration samples had only marginally reduced DNA content: from 6. 3 to 6. 0 μg m 1 - 1 respectively. Hence the filtration train was shown to ineffective in DNA removal. Historically, blinding of the depth filters had been unpredictable with data such as numbers of viable cells, non-viable cells, product titre, or process shape (batch, fed-batch, or draw and fill) failing to inform on the durability of depth filters in the harvest step. To investigate this, key fouling contaminants were identified by challenging depth filters with the same mass of one of the following: viable healthy cells, cells that had died by the process of apoptosis, and cells that had died through the process of necrosis. The pressure increase across a Cuno Zeta Plus 10 SP depth filter was 2. 8 and 16. 5 times more sensitive to debris from apoptotic and necrotic cells respectively, when compared to viable cells. The condition of DNA released into the culture broth was assessed. Necrotic cells released predominantly high molecular weight DNA in contrast to apoptotic cells which released chiefly low molecular weight DNA. The blinding of the filters was found to be largely unaffected by variations in the particle size distribution of material in, and viscosity of, solutions with which they were challenged. The exceptional response of the depth filters to necrotic cells may suggest the cause of previously noted unpredictable filter blinding whereby a number of necrotic cells have a more significant impact on the life of a depth filter than a similar number of viable or apoptotic cells. In a final set of experiments the pressure drop caused by non-viable necrotic culture broths which had been treated with DNase I or benzonase was found to be smaller when compared to untreated broths: the abilities of the enzyme treated cultures to foul the depth filter were reduced by 70. 4 % and 75. 4 % respectively indicating the importance of DNA in the blinding of the depth filter studied...|$|E
40|$|Restricted Access. Liquid {{crystals}} of disc-like molecules {{fall into}} two distinct structural types, the columnar and the nematic. The columnar phase in its simplest form consists of <b>discs</b> <b>stacked</b> a periodically in columns, the different columns constituting a two-dimensional array, whereas the nematic phase is an orientationally ordered arrangement of discs without any long-range translational order. After {{a brief review of}} the structures of the various mesophases, two topics are considered in somewhat greater detail., (i) An extension of McMillan's mean field model of smectic A to liquid crystals of disc-like molecules. The translational order is now assumed to be periodic in two dimensions. Calculations show that when the lattice is hexagonal, or departs from it only slightly, the transition from the columnar to the isotropic phase may take place either directly or via a nematic phase, depending on the model potential parameters a. Interpreting a to be a measure of the chain lengths as in McMillan's model, the theoretical phase diagram is shown to be in broad agreement with the experimental trends. As the asymmetry of the lattice is increased the theory predicts the occurrence of a smectic A phase as well. The new smectic A phase is biaxial. (ii) A theoretical study of fluctuations in the columnar liquid crystal. It is shown that the Frank elasticity of the liquid-like columns stabilizes the two-dimensional order, a result that was in fact envisaged by Peierls and Landau in the 1930 s. The mean- square fluctuation of the lattice as well as the Debye-Waller factor show a certain dependence on the linear dimensions of the sample...|$|R

40|$|The retina is {{a highly}} ordered tissue whose {{outermost}} layers are formed by subcellular compartments of photoreceptors generating light-evoked electrical responses. We studied protein distributions among individual photoreceptor compartments by separating the entire photoreceptor layer of a flat-mounted frozen retina {{into a series of}} thin tangential cryosections and analyzing protein compositions of each section by label-free quantitative mass spectrometry. Based on 5038 confidently identified peptides assigned to 896 protein database entries, we generated a quantitative proteomic database (a “map”) correlating the distribution profiles of identified proteins with the profiles of marker proteins representing individual compartments of photoreceptors and adjacent cells. We evaluated the applicability of several common peptide-to-protein quantification algorithms in the context of our database and found that the highest reliability was obtained by summing the intensities of all peptides representing a given protein, using at least the 5 – 6 most intense peptides when applicable. We used this proteome map to investigate the distribution of glycolytic enzymes, critical in fulfilling the extremely high metabolic demands of photoreceptor cells, and obtained two major findings. First, unlike the majority of neurons rich in hexokinase I, but similar to other highly metabolically active cells, photoreceptors express hexokinase II. Hexokinase II has a very high catalytic activity when associated with mitochondria, and indeed we found it colocalized with mitochondria in photoreceptors. Second, photoreceptors contain very little triosephosphate isomerase, an enzyme converting dihydroxyacetone phosphate into glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate. This may serve as a functional adaptation because dihydroxyacetone phosphate is a major precursor in phospholipid biosynthesis, a process particularly active in photoreceptors because of the constant renewal of their light-sensitive membrane <b>disc</b> <b>stacks.</b> Overall, our approach for proteomic profiling of very small tissue amounts at a resolution of a few microns, combining cryosectioning and liquid chromatography-tandem MS, can be applied for quantitative investigation of proteomes where spatial resolution is paramount...|$|R
