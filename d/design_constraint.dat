This renders the traditional manually tuned and chip-centered I/O designs suboptimal {{in terms of both}} turn around time and design quality. In this paper we formally introduce a set of <b>design</b> <b>constraints</b> suitable for chip-package co-design. We formulate a constraint-driven I/O planning and placement problem, and solve it by a multi-step algorithm based upon integer linear programming. Experiment results using real industry designs show that the proposed algorithm can effectively find a large scale I/O placement solution and satisfy all given <b>design</b> <b>constraints</b> in less than 10 minutes.

[...] The project {{was the first of}} its kind to be undertaken in Afghanistan and was allocated a budget of £3.5million. [...] The road designed was [...] long and [...] wide. [...] One <b>design</b> <b>constraint</b> was that the patrol bases had to be able to see straight along the route to prevent insurgents gaining unmonitored access to the road. [...] Another factor was a [...] wide wadi known as the Suf Mandah that consisted of two water bearing channels. [...] This provided agricultural irrigation for the local people and so could not be interrupted during construction because of its economic importance. [...] The design for this section included a floating roadway over the waterlogged ground and two box culverts for the irrigation channels. [...] The 17smaller culverts along the route were made from reinforced concrete and stone gabions. [...] The road itself was designed to be of unbound aggregate that could in the future be overlain with an asphalt surfacing.|$|E

40|$|<b>Design</b> <b>constraints</b> express {{essential}} behavioural {{properties of}} a software system. Two {{key elements of}} a scheme for enforcing <b>design</b> <b>constraints</b> are presented: a logic for describing the constraints, and an analysis {{that can be used}} both to explore the constraints in isolation (and thus gain confidence in their correctness), and to check that they are obeyed by an implementation. Examples of applications of the logic and its analysis at various levels of abstraction are given, from high-level designs to finding bugs in code. The challenge of bridging several levels, and checking code against abstract <b>design</b> <b>constraints,</b> is illustrated with a scenario from an air-traffic control system. Introduction Implementations often violate their <b>design</b> <b>constraints,</b> and consequently behave in a way that could not be predicted from the design alone.

40|$|As more {{processing}} {{elements are}} integrated {{in a single}} chip, embedded software design becomes more challenging: It becomes a parallel programming for non-trivial heterogeneous multi-processors with diverse communication architectures and <b>design</b> <b>constraints</b> such as hardware cost, power, and timeliness. In the current practice of parallel programming with MPI or OpenMP, the programmer should manually optimize the parallel code for each target architecture and <b>design</b> <b>constraints.</b> Thus <b>design</b> space exploration of MPSoC (Multi-Processor System-on-a-Chip) costs prohibitively large as software development overhead increases drastically. To solve this problem, we develop a parallel programming framework based on a novel programming model called Common Intermediate Code (CIC). In a CIC, functional parallelism and data parallelism of application tasks are specified independently of the target architecture and the <b>design</b> <b>constraints.</b> Then, the CIC translator translates the CIC into the final parallel code considering the target architecture and the <b>design</b> <b>constraints,</b> to make the CIC retargetable.
