5|$|In {{the later}} {{parts of his}} career and {{especially}} following retirement, Gascoigne's life became dominated by severe mental and emotional problems, particularly alcoholism. He has been jailed or sectioned on numerous occasions and his personal struggles receive regular coverage in the British press. He has frequently attempted to live without alcohol, though rehabilitation programmes have provided only temporary relief. His personal issues ended his coaching career, and he <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>worked</b> in football since being fired as the manager of Kettering Town in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The regular main {{composer}} for the Tales {{series is}} Motoi Sakuraba. His first {{work on the}} series was for Phantasia, and has since contributed to nearly every main entry since there in the capacity of a freelance composer. Sakuraba has become noted for his signature musical style, which {{is present in the}} majority of his Tales scores. He also frequently collaborates with Shinji Tamura. The entries Sakuraba <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>worked</b> on are Legendia, which was composed by Go Shiina, an in-house composer, and Innocence, whose composer was Kazuhiro Nakamura. Sakuraba and Shiina had collaborated on the score for Zestiria. Multiple titles in the series use licensed theme songs by multiple Japanese artists: among the artists are Garnet Crow (Eternia), Deen (Destiny/Hearts), Kokia (Innocence), Ayumi Hamasaki (Xillia/Xillia 2) and FLOW (Berseria). One recurring aspect of many earlier localizations was the removal of the Japanese theme song, such as with Symphonia, which had its theme song replaced with an orchestral version. The first western release of a Tales title to feature the theme song used in Japan was Vesperia.|$|E

Diana discovers that Paul is blackmailing Toadie into covering up his embezzlement. Paul tells Diana that he has sold PirateNet and that his money troubles will soon be over, before giving her cab fare to the airport. Diana tells Rosemary {{that she was the}} one who secured the deal to sell PirateNet and that she did the deal to protect Paul. Rosemary is grateful and tells Diana that she will book her a flight home. Diana asks Paul to comes to her hotel room and she tries to seduce him, but he pushes her away. Diana tells him that she is not going anywhere and that she will take everything from him. Paul goads Diana when she comes into Charlie's, he tells her that it was fun crushing her and Diana throws her drink in Paul's face. Diana is about to go home, when she hears that Paul has decided to put Declan in charge of Lassiter's for six months, so he can spend more time with his family. Diana asks Declan to help her bring Paul and Rosemary down and he agrees. Diana begins calling the board members in the hope that she can persuade them to vote Rosemary and Paul out. Paul discovers that Toadie and Declan are working against him and he tells Rosemary about Diana's plan. Diana goes to Declan's office and finds Paul waiting for her. He tells her that her plan <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>worked</b> and that Rosemary has fired her.|$|E

They point to near-defaults, defaults, and financial disasters not detected by the rating agencies' post-issuance surveillance, or ratings of troubled debt securities not downgraded until just before (or even after) bankruptcy. These include the 1970 Penn Central bankruptcy, the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis, the 1994 Orange County default, the Asian and Russian financial crises, the 1998 collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, the 2001 Enron and WorldCom bankruptcies, and especially the 2007–8 subprime mortgage crisis.|$|E

Maggie Roswell returned to The Simpsons in 2002 after reaching a deal with Fox to record her lines from her home, and Gaven <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>worked</b> for the show since that year.|$|E

500|$|Moser {{published}} Cortinarius Fr. und nahe verwandte Gattungen in Südamerika in 1975, {{which was}} coauthored by Egon Horak. The work, {{along with his}} earlier monograph on [...] "Phlegmacium", proved to be some of Moser's most important, serving to encourage others to engage with Cortinarius in a meaningful way. Cortinarius Fr. und nahe verwandte Gattungen in Südamerika was a study of Cortinarius, Dermocybe and Stephanopus, a new genus first described in that work, in South America, and was dedicated to Singer. The work contained descriptions of 276 new species. Alexander H. Smith stressed {{the significance of the}} work, saying [...] "Anyone who <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>worked</b> in the systematics of Cortinarius cannot fully appreciate the magnitude and importance of this work to the general subject of the distribution and speciation of the higher fungi." ...|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were as positive, however. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "C+" [...] and highly criticized the {{characterization}} of Michael. Largely, he felt that Michael's antics made him {{out to be a}} jerk because the series <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>worked</b> at showing that he truly [...] "isn’t a complete asshole". Adams noted that Michael [...] "could truly force Darryl and his staff to work on Saturdays, and he truly could fire them for winning the basketball game. But that would be an outrageous abuse of legitimate power, which isn’t funny." [...] Ultimately he argued that the basketball scenes went on for too long; he said the [...] "episode’s original cut ran too long to air, and it’s obvious where the basketball scenes boxed out other threads of the episode".|$|E

[...] Producer Ramesh Taurani responded negatively to the idea, saying, [...] "It is important for the film to be appreciated so that a sequel can be made." [...] Trade analyst Atul Mohan called the sequel [...] "a bad idea." [...] Conversely, others were supportive of the sequel. Producer Goldie Behl brushed aside arguments about the success of the first film, saying, [...] "If the people think that they can earn some more, then it doesn't matter how big or small the hit was." [...] Director Kunal Kohli also reacted positively, saying, [...] "Certain ideas naturally lend themselves to sequels. So why not use that investment of your time and effort to make a sequel that will take the brand further?" ...|$|E

500|$|In May 1999, Nicolas Anelka stated {{his desire}} to leave Arsenal and cited the English media {{as a reason for}} wanting to leave the club as they caused him [...] "enormous {{problems}} on a personal level". Lazio was interested in signing the player, but the Italian club refused to pay Arsenal's asking price of £23million. After Real Madrid reopened negotiations with Arsenal and Anelka, a deal was finally reached on 1 August 1999 and the player signed for the club, the next day. Arsenal sought to strengthen the squad's attacking options first by signing Davor Šuker from Real Madrid; the player was prepared to take a pay cut to join the club. The club then signed Juventus forward Thierry Henry for a club record fee of £11million. Wenger, who served as the player's protégé at Monaco, believed his best position was as a goalscorer: [...] "He was the top scorer in the Under-17s for France when I first had him and I think that, as well as having the qualities of youth, pace and power, he is a good finisher. That is something he <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>worked</b> on enough {{in the last two years}} because he has played more wide, but I think he can become a central striker again. That is what we will try to develop together." ...|$|E
500|$|Livingstone {{describes}} himself as a socialist. In 1987, he stated that [...] "politics is my religion. It's my moral framework. I believe a socialist society is inherently the best thing, and that's like an act of faith." [...] In 2007, he stated that [...] "I still believe one day that the idea that the main means of production are owned by private individuals... will be considered as anti-democratic as the idea serfs could be tied to the land. But I will not be alive when that day comes." [...] Livingstone had always worked towards a unified socialist front on the British left, and disliked the tendency towards splintering and forming rival factions, usually over issues of political theory, among the socialist community. Although rejecting Marxism, throughout his political career he has worked alongside Marxist far-left groups and has become involved with the [...] "politics of the street". He <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>worked</b> with those Marxist groups, such as the Socialist Workers Party and the Revolutionary Communist Party, who advocate the destruction of the Labour Party as the way forward for socialism, seeing their beliefs as incompatible with his own. Livingstone has consistently opposed the actions of the Israeli government. In a 2005 interview {{he said that he was}} not against the existence of Israel, but rather Ariel Sharon's government; he recalled that on his 1986 visit to the country he got on well with its left-wing politicians.|$|E

The pair, who had not spoken to one another since 1994, were spotted drinking in London just four days after Suede's final gig. In 2004, they resurfaced with a project named The Tears. The following year they released the album Here Come the Tears, which was well received by critics. Despite making the UK Top 15, it failed to generate broader interest beyond their hardcore fanbase. One review remarked that the record was not [...] "far from the records Suede made without their errant guitarist". The band <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>worked</b> since 2006. Anderson has released four solo albums: Brett Anderson (2007), Wilderness (2008), Slow Attack (2009) and Black Rainbows (2011); with the exception of his latest effort, his discography has garnered a mixed reaction. Butler has been working as a producer, collaborating with artists such as Black Kids, Sons and Daughters, Duffy and Kate Nash. Simon Gilbert played with local Bangkok band Futon, while Richard Oakes started working with Sean McGhee in a duo called Artmagic, whose debut album Become The One You Love, was released in 2012.
