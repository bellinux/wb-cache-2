500|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} with meiosis {{has been}} directly observed in all fungal phyla except Glomeromycota [...] (genetic analysis suggests meiosis in Glomeromycota as well). It differs in many aspects from sexual reproduction in animals or plants. Differences also exist between fungal groups {{and can be}} used to discriminate species by morphological differences in sexual structures and reproductive strategies. Mating experiments between fungal isolates may identify species on the basis of biological species concepts. The major fungal groupings have initially been delineated based on the morphology of their sexual structures and spores; for example, the spore-containing structures, asci and basidia, can be used in the identification of ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, respectively. Some species may allow mating only between individuals of opposite mating type, whereas others can mate and sexually reproduce with any other individual or itself. Species of the former mating system are called heterothallic, and of the latter <b>homothallic.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Among the 250 known {{species of}} aspergilli, about 33% have an {{identified}} sexual state. [...] Among those Aspergillus species that exhibit a sexual cycle {{the overwhelming majority}} in nature are <b>homothallic</b> (self-fertilizing). [...] Selfing in the <b>homothallic</b> fungus Aspergillus nidulans involves activation of the same mating pathways characteristic of sex in outcrossing species, i.e. self-fertilization does not bypass required pathways for outcrossing sex but instead requires activation of these pathways within a single individual. [...] Fusion of haploid nuclei occurs within reproductive structures termed cleistothecia, in which the diploid zygote undergoes meiotic divisions to yield haploid ascospores.|$|E
2500|$|When {{incubated}} {{with their}} bacterial food supply, heterothallic or <b>homothallic</b> sexual development can occur, {{resulting in the}} formation of a diploid zygote. [...] Heterothallic mating occurs when two amoebae of different mating types are present in a dark and wet environment, where they can fuse during aggregation to form a giant zygote cell. The giant cell then releases cAMP to attract other cells, then engulfs the other cells cannibalistically in the aggregate. The consumed cells serve to encase the whole aggregate in a thick, cellulose wall to protect it. This is known as a macrocyst. Inside the macrocyst, the giant cell divides first through meiosis, then through mitosis to produce many haploid amoebae that will be released to feed as normal amoebae would. <b>Homothallic</b> D. discoideum strains AC4 and ZA3A are also able to produce macrocysts. [...] Each of these strains, unlike heterothallic strains, likely express both mating type alleles (matA and mata). [...] While sexual reproduction is possible, it is very rare to see successful germination of a D. discoideum macrocyst under laboratory conditions. [...] Nevertheless, recombination is widespread within D. discoideum natural populations, indicating that sex is likely an important aspect of their lifecycle.|$|E
2500|$|The pileus or cap of the {{original}} wild species is a pale grey-brown in color, with broad, flat scales on a paler background and fading toward the margins. It is first hemispherical in shape before flattening out with maturity, and [...] in diameter. The narrow, crowded gills are free and initially, pink, then red-brown and finally a dark brown with a whitish edge from the cheilocystidia. The cylindrical stipe is up to [...] tall by 1–2cm wide and bears a thick and narrow ring, which may be streaked on the upper side. The firm flesh is white, although stains a pale pinkish-red on bruising. The spore print is dark brown. The spores are oval to round and measure approximately 4.5–5.5μm [...] 5–7.5μm, and the basidia usually two-spored, although two-tetrasporic varieties have been described from the Mojave Desert and the Mediterranean, with predominantly heterothallic and <b>homothallic</b> lifestyles, respectively.|$|E

5000|$|Sexual {{development}} can occur when amoeboid cells are starved for their bacterial food supply and dark humid conditions are present. [...] Both heterothallic and <b>homothallic</b> strains of Dictostelium can undergo mating. Heterothallic sexual {{development has been}} most extensively studied in D. discoideum, and <b>homothallic</b> sexual development has been most well studied in D. mucoroides. [...] Heterothallic matings are initiated by fusion of haploid cells (gametes) from two strains of opposite mating type.

5000|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} is usually heterothallic, but <b>homothallic</b> strains also exist.|$|E
5000|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} {{be either}} <b>homothallic</b> or heterothallic. <b>Homothallic</b> reproduction {{is characterized by}} the fusion of the asexual oogonium and antheridium. This fusion leads to the formation and release of sexual oospores, the primary inoculum for the next season. Heterothallic sexual reproduction is the fusion of sexual cells from two separate organisms, leading to [...] "outcrossing".|$|E
50|$|<b>Homothallic</b> {{species may}} likely have evolved from heterothallic {{ancestors}} (Lin and Heitman 2007). In Basidiomycota homothallism {{is not very}} common and in Agaricomycotina {{it is estimated that}} only 10% of species have <b>homothallic</b> mating behavior. For example, one subspecies of the ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycete Sistotrema brinkmannii is <b>homothallic,</b> although other subspecies have maintained their ability to outcross. Also, a variety of the edible mushroom Agaricus bisporus, (A. bisporus var. eurotetrasporus) produces haploid self-fertile basidiospores. Additionally, in the human pathogen C. neoformans known to outcross under laboratory conditions, both mating types are not normally distributed in natural populations, with the α mating type much more commonly found (>99%), suggesting homothallism is the most prevalent mode of sexual reproduction in ´C. neoformans in nature. Finally, the fungus causing witches’ broom in cacao, Moniliophthora perniciosa, has a primarily <b>homothallic</b> biology despite having A and B mating type-like genes in its genome.|$|E

[...] Heterothallic mating has been best studied in Dictyostelium discoideum and <b>homothallic</b> mating has been best studied in Dictyostelium mucoroides (strain DM7). In the heterothallic sexual cycle, amoebae aggregate in response to cAMP and sex pheromones, and two cells of opposite mating types fuse, and then begin consuming the other attracted cells. Before they are consumed, some of the prey cells form a cellulose wall around the entire group. When cannibalism is complete, the giant diploid cell is a hardy macrocyst which eventually undergoes recombination and meiosis, and hatches hundreds of recombinants. [...] In D. mucoroides (DM7) <b>homothallic</b> mating, cells are directed towards sexual development by ethylene.|$|E

A. fumigatus, a heterothallic (outcrossing) fungus that occurs in areas with widely different climates and environments, also displays little genetic variability either within geographic regions or on a global scale, again suggesting sex, in this case outcrossing sex, can be maintained even when little genetic variability is produced.|$|E

50|$|Most lichens produce {{abundant}} sexual structures. Many species {{appear to}} disperse only by sexual spores.

Instead, the lichen-forming fungi {{of these species}} reproduce sexually by self-fertilization (i.e. they are <b>homothallic).</b> This breeding system may enable successful reproduction in harsh environments.|$|E
50|$|In heterothallic species, the oogonia and antheridia {{are located}} on hyphal {{branches}} of different thallophyte colonies. Oogonia of this species can only be fertilized by antheridia from another colony and ensures that self-fertilization is impossible.

5000|$|Members of the Mycetozoa {{group are}} able to undergo sexual {{reproduction}} either by heterothallic or <b>homothallic</b> mating An analysis of meiosis-related genes in the Dictyostelium discoideum genome revealed that 36 of the 44 genes tested {{were present in the}} genome.

50|$|Some Mortierella {{species are}} <b>homothallic</b> (M. epigama, M. parvispora, M. nigrescens,M. rostafinskii, M. polycephala, M.renispora), {{but most are}} heterothallic (M. elongata, M. marburgensis, M. umbelata, M. capitata, M. indohi). The species Mortierella alpina {{was found to be}} <b>homothallic</b> and to form zygospores with a hyphal coat. Most Mortierella species {{have been found to be}} heterothallic and to produce naked zygospores with unequal suspensors. Very often sexual {{structures}} differ in size between mating types. The smaller suspensor, progametangium or gametangium does not enlarge during sexual development and may disappear soon after plasmogamy. The early development of such heterogametangic zygospores is illustrated in the heterothallic species, M. umbellata. In this species, hyphal coiling occurs at the contact site of sexually compatible mycelia. This is followed by development of progametangia which grow in parallel and close to each other. At the end of this development, one partner, the macroprogametangium will be larger than the other, the microprogametangium.|$|E
50|$|Phytophthora uliginosa is a non-papillate <b>homothallic</b> plant {{pathogen}} that mainly infects European oak.

P. Uliginosa is separated from P. europaea by its larger oogonia without tapering bases and its greater aggressiveness on Q. Robur.|$|E
50|$|During sexual reproduction, {{compatible}} strains form short, specialized hyphae called gametangia. At {{the point}} where two complementary gametangia fuse, a thick-walled, spherical zygosporangium develops. The zygosporangium typically contains a single zygospore.

They may germinate to form hyphae or a sporangium. Mucor includes both <b>homothallic</b> (self-compatible) and heterothallic species.|$|E
5000|$|Mating in fungi is {{a complex}} process governed by mating types. Research on fungal mating has focused on several model species with {{different}} behaviour.
