5|$|A {{parabolic}} trough {{consists of a}} linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's <b>focal</b> <b>line.</b> The receiver is a tube positioned right above {{the middle of the}} parabolic mirror and is filled with a working fluid. The reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. Parabolic trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology. The SEGS plants in California and Acciona's Nevada Solar One near Boulder City, Nevada are representatives of this technology.|$|E
5|$|Trough systems {{convert the}} heat from the sun into electricity. Because of their {{parabolic}} shape, trough collectors can focus the sun at 30-60 times its normal intensity on a receiver pipe located along the <b>focal</b> <b>line</b> of the trough. Synthetic oil circulates through the pipe and captures this heat, reaching temperatures of 390°C (735°F). The hot oil is pumped to a generating station and routed through a heat exchanger to produce steam. Finally, electricity is produced in a conventional steam turbine. The SEGS plants operate on natural gas on cloudy days or after dark, and natural gas provides 25% of the total output.|$|E

25|$|Parabolic troughs {{are used}} to {{concentrate}} sunlight for solar-energy purposes. Some solar cookers have been built that use {{them in the same}} way. Generally, the trough is aligned with its <b>focal</b> <b>line</b> horizontal and east-west. The food to be cooked is arranged along this line. The trough is pointed so its axis of symmetry aims at the sun at noon. This requires the trough to be tilted up and down as the seasons progress. At the equinoxes, no movement of the trough is needed during the day to track the sun. At other times of year, there is a period of several hours around noon each day when no tracking is needed. Usually, the cooker is used only during this period, so no automatic sun tracking is incorporated into it. This simplicity makes the design attractive, compared with using a paraboloid. Also, being a , the trough reflector is simpler to construct. However, it suffers from lower efficiency.|$|E
2500|$|German {{physicist}} Heinrich Hertz {{constructed the}} world's first parabolic reflector antenna in 1888. The antenna was a cylindrical parabolic reflector made of zinc sheet metal {{supported by a}} wooden frame, and had a spark-gap excited dipole as a feed antenna along the <b>focal</b> <b>line.</b> [...] Its aperture was 2 meters high by 1.2 meters wide, with a focal length of 0.12 meters, and was used at an operating frequency of about 450MHz. [...] With two such antennas, one used for transmitting {{and the other for}} receiving, Hertz demonstrated the existence of radio waves which had been predicted by James Clerk Maxwell some 22 years earlier. [...] However, the early development of radio [...] was limited to lower frequencies at which parabolic antennas were unsuitable, and they were not widely used until after World War 2, when microwave frequencies began to be exploited.|$|E

50|$|A {{parabolic}} trough {{is a type}} of solar thermal collector that is straight in one dimension and curved as a parabola in the other two, lined with a polished metal mirror. The energy of sunlight which enters the mirror parallel to its plane of symmetry is focused along the <b>focal</b> <b>line,</b> where objects are positioned that are intended to be heated. For example, food may be placed at the <b>focal</b> <b>line</b> of a trough, which causes the food to be cooked when the trough is aimed so the Sun is in its plane of symmetry. Further information on the use of {{parabolic trough}}s for cooking {{can be found in the}} article about solar cookers.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe have {{investigated}} Focal Conic Domains (FCD) in several materials {{that have a}} transition from a SmA to a nematic phase (N) : the <b>focal</b> <b>lines</b> are seldom an ideal ellipse and an ideal hyperbola, and suffer large transformations (in shape and in size) when approaching {{the transition to the}} nematic phase, or appear imperfect on cooling from the nematic phase. Some examples of these transformations are shown, including the temperature dependence of the ellipse diameter. Contrari- wise, FCDs remain unchanged on heating up to or cooling down from the transition to the isotropic phase in materials that have a direct transition to the isotropic phase. We interpret the imperfections of the FCDs observed in nematogenic materials as due to the interactions of FCDs with dislocations.

5000|$|A point O (fig. 2) at {{a finite}} {{distance}} from the axis (or with an infinitely distant object, a point which subtends a finite angle at the system) is, in general, even then not sharply reproduced if the pencil of rays issuing from it and traversing the system is made infinitely narrow by reducing the aperture stop; such a pencil consists of the rays which can pass from the object point through the now infinitely small entrance pupil. It is seen (ignoring exceptional cases) that the pencil {{does not meet the}} refracting or reflecting surface at right angles; therefore it is astigmatic (Gr. a-, privative, stigmia, a point). Naming the central ray passing through the entrance pupil the axis of the pencil or principal ray, it can be said: the rays of the pencil intersect, not in one point, but in two <b>focal</b> <b>lines,</b> which can be assumed to be at right angles to the principal ray; of these, one lies in the plane containing the principal ray and the axis of the system, i.e. in the first principal section or meridional section, and the other at right angles to it, i.e. in the second principal section or sagittal section. We receive, therefore, in no single intercepting plane behind the system, as, for example, a focusing screen, an image of the object point; on the other hand, in each of two planes lines O' and O" [...] are separately formed (in neighboring planes ellipses are formed), and in a plane between O' and O" [...] a circle of least confusion. The interval O'O", termed the astigmatic difference, increases, in general, with the angle W made by the principal ray OP with the axis of the system, i.e. with the field of view. Two astigmatic image surfaces correspond to one object plane; and these are in contact at the axis point; on the one lie the <b>focal</b> <b>lines</b> of the first kind, on the other those of the second. Systems in which the two astigmatic surfaces coincide are termed anastigmatic or stigmatic.|$|R
