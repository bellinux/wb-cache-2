5|$|Van Gogh found respite {{and relief}} in {{interaction}} with nature. When {{the series of}} olive tree paintings was made in 1889 he was subject to illness and emotional turmoil, yet the paintings {{are considered to be}} among <b>his</b> <b>finest</b> works.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's speech {{received}} much less attention than his (now famous) remarks in Indianapolis and was largely forgotten {{by the news}} media. Regardless, several of his aides considered it to be among <b>his</b> <b>finest</b> orations. Journalist Jack Newfield was {{of the opinion that}} the address was a suitable epitaph for the senator, who was himself assassinated two months later.|$|E
5|$|The operas of his mature period, Jenůfa (1904), Káťa Kabanová (1921), The Cunning Little Vixen (1924), The Makropulos Affair (1926) and From the House of the Dead (after a {{novel by}} Dostoyevsky and premièred posthumously in 1930) are {{considered}} <b>his</b> <b>finest</b> works. The Australian conductor Sir Charles Mackerras became very closely associated with Janáček's operas.|$|E

50|$|In the 2000s, Williams {{returned}} to <b>his</b> <b>fine</b> arts roots, painting multiple series of abstract, geometric paintings. In the late 2000s, <b>his</b> <b>fine</b> art {{returned to}} figurative work, combining elements of 1960s comics with painting techniques.|$|R
5000|$|In Act V of Hamlet, Hamlet {{is in the}} graveyard, speculating on the {{possible}} former identities of the remains being removed from the grave: [...] "This fellow might be in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, <b>his</b> recognizances, <b>his</b> <b>fines,</b> <b>his</b> double vouchers, his recoveries: is this the <b>fine</b> of <b>his</b> <b>fines,</b> and the recovery of his recoveries, to have <b>his</b> <b>fine</b> pate full of fine dirt?" [...] In this instance, fine is used in four separate ways and recovery used in two.|$|R
5|$|Against Surrey on August 6, King was overpowering again. It {{was in this}} {{match that}} King gave what Barker called <b>his</b> <b>finest</b> {{first-class}} performance ever. Batting first, he scored 98 runs in the Philadelphian's first innings before being run out, and he then took 3 for 89 in Surrey's reply. In the second innings, he made 113 not out and then took 3 for 98. Surrey lost the match by 110 runs. Apparently, King was so exhausted after his performance that he fell asleep during a speech by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Alverstone at a banquet after the match.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, {{his return}} for England came against Scotland on 12 April 1947 at Wembley, in a match which {{finished}} as a 1–1 draw. In the summer he {{took part in}} England's tour of Switzerland and Portugal. Following a surprise defeat to the Swiss, England cantered to a 10–0 win over the Portuguese, with Matthews scoring the 10th. In September, he put in one of <b>his</b> <b>finest</b> performances in an England shirt as he set up all of England's five goals in a 5–2 victory over Belgium.|$|E
5|$|In 1971 the Wales {{national}} team entered {{what is considered}} their second 'Golden Age', with a team rich in experience and talent. John {{was part of the}} team that won the 1971 Five Nations Championship, the first time Wales had achieved a Grand Slam win since 1952. He then cemented his {{reputation as one of the}} sport's greatest players with his pivotal role in the British Lions winning tour over New Zealand in 1971. On the 1971 tour, John played in all four Tests, playing some of <b>his</b> <b>finest</b> rugby and finishing as the Lions' top Test scorer.|$|E

5|$|Neoclassicism {{continued}} to be a major style into the nineteenth century. William Henry Playfair (1790–1857) was the designer of many of Edinburgh's neoclassical landmarks in the New Town. Two of <b>his</b> <b>finest</b> works are the National Gallery of Scotland and the Royal Scottish Academy, which are situated in the centre of Edinburgh. However, the figure most associated with the classical style was Alexander 'Greek' Thomson (1817–75). Working mainly in Glasgow, he turned away from the Gothic style toward that of the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, {{as can be seen in}} the temple and columns that were part of the Caledonia Road Church (1856).|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Assaye {{was a major}} {{battle of}} the Second Anglo-Maratha War fought between the Maratha Empire and the British East India Company. It {{occurred}} on 23 September 1803 near Assaye in western India where an outnumbered Indian and British force {{under the command of}} Major General Arthur Wellesley (who later became the Duke of Wellington) defeated a combined Maratha army of Daulat Scindia and the Raja of Berar. The battle was the Duke of Wellington's first major victory and one he later described as <b>his</b> <b>finest</b> accomplishment on the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|The Kagawa Prefectural Government Hall on {{the island}} of Shikoku was {{completed}} in 1958. Its expressive construction could be likened to the Daibutsu style seen at the Tōdai-ji in Nara. The columns on the elevation bore only vertical loads so Tange was able to design them to be thin, maximising the surfaces for glazing. Although the hall has been called one of <b>his</b> <b>finest</b> projects, it drew criticism {{at the time of its}} construction for relying too heavily on tradition.|$|E

5|$|Van Meegeren was a {{prolific}} artist and produced thousands of original paintings {{in a number}} of diverse styles. This wide range in painting and drawing styles often irritated art critics. Some of his typical works are classical still lifes in convincing 17th century manner, Impressionistic paintings of people frolicking on lakes or beaches, jocular drawings where the subject is drawn with rather odd features, Surrealistic paintings with combined fore- and backgrounds. Van Meegeren's portraits, however, are probably <b>his</b> <b>finest</b> works.|$|E
5|$|After Cold Harbor, Lee and the Confederate {{high command}} {{were unable to}} {{anticipate}} Grant's next move, but Beauregard's strategic sense allowed {{him to make a}} prophetic prediction: Grant would cross the James River and attempt to seize Petersburg, which was lightly defended, but contained critical rail junctions supporting Richmond and Lee. Despite persistent pleas to reinforce this sector, Beauregard could not convince his colleagues of the danger. On June 15, his weak 5,400-man force—including boys, old men, and patients from military hospitals—resisted an assault by 16,000 Federals, known as the Second Battle of Petersburg. He gambled by withdrawing his Bermuda Hundred defenses to reinforce the city, assuming correctly that Butler would not capitalize on the opening. His gamble succeeded, and he held Petersburg long enough for Lee's army to arrive. It was arguably <b>his</b> <b>finest</b> combat performance of the war.|$|E
5|$|Although ecplised by Scots Baronial and Gothic forms, Neo-classicism {{continued}} to be a major style into the nineteenth century.

Two of <b>his</b> <b>finest</b> works are the National Gallery of Scotland and the Royal Scottish Academy, which are situated in the centre of Edinburgh.

5|$|Reviews of {{the soundtrack}} album were positive, with critics praising both {{the variety of}} styles {{and quality of the}} pieces. Several critics noted Mizuta's work as {{possibly}} <b>his</b> <b>finest</b> to date. Reviewers of the game were more mixed, with some feeling that some of the styles of music did not match where they were played in the game. Critics were also mixed in their opinions of the arranged album, feeling that several of the pieces were simply inferior versions of the original tracks. Both of the albums and the single sold well enough to place on the Japanese Oricon charts, with the original soundtrack album reaching a peak of #13 and remaining on the charts for eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, despite {{changing}} musical trends, Peerson's music {{showed significant}} roots in Renaissance polyphony. However, he was adept {{in the use}} of then-modern compositional procedures; this is evident in his often daring use of chromaticism, especially seen in word painting. Some of <b>his</b> <b>finest</b> music is contained in his set of 15 Latin motets, which was probably composed {{around the turn of the}} century. Existing only in a single copy, it originally consisted of five part-books but the Cantus book is lost. Richard Rastall, professor of historical musicology at the University of Leeds, spent 12 years reconstructing the missing part. The complete Latin motets have been published by Antico Edition, and a recording of their performance by Ex Cathedra entitled Peerson: Latin Motets was produced by Hyperion Records in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{broke his}} nose at Craven Cottage on {{the opening day of}} the 1962–63 season, in a 2–1 defeat by Fulham. Leicester went to chase a {{possible}} double, reaching the FA Cup semi-finals whilst lying top of the table in April. City beat Liverpool 1–0 at Hillsborough to reach the final, with Banks keeping a clean sheet despite his goal being under a near-constant siege from the Merseyside club. The News of the World reported that Liverpool had had 34 attempts on goal to Leicester's one, and Banks later stated that it was <b>his</b> <b>finest</b> performance at club level. Unluckily, Banks then broke a finger in a 2–1 defeat by West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns, and was out injured as Leicester lost their final three league games, ending the season in a disappointing fourth place. In the 1963 FA Cup Final Banks {{and the rest of the}} team underperformed, and lost the game 3–1 to Manchester United.|$|E

60|$|Although Harry Mulford {{was neither}} Puffendorf, nor Grotius, {{he had too}} much common sense, and too little {{prejudice}} in favour of even his own vocation, to swallow such a theory, had fifty Cherry Street lawyers sworn to its justice.

5|$|In early 1973, the Soviet studio Mosfilm {{approached}} the filmmaker {{to ask if}} he would be interested in working with them. Kurosawa proposed an adaptation of Russian explorer Vladimir Arsenyev's autobiographical work Dersu Uzala. The book, about a Goldi hunter who lives in harmony with nature until destroyed by encroaching civilization, was one that he had wanted to make since the 1930s. In December 1973, the 63-year-old Kurosawa set off for the Soviet Union with four of his closest aides, beginning a year-and-a-half stay in the country. Shooting began in May 1974 in Siberia, with filming in exceedingly harsh natural conditions proving very difficult and demanding. The picture wrapped in April 1975, with a thoroughly exhausted and homesick Kurosawa returning to Japan and his family in June. Dersu Uzala had its world premiere in Japan on August 2, 1975, and did well at the box office. While critical reception in Japan was muted, the film was better reviewed abroad, winning the Golden Prize at the 9th Moscow International Film Festival, as well as an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Today, critics remain divided over the film: some see it as an example of Kurosawa's alleged artistic decline, while others count it among <b>his</b> <b>finest</b> works.|$|E
5|$|Michael Kennedy characterises Vaughan Williams's {{music as}} a {{strongly}} individual blending of the modal harmonies familiar from folk‐song with the French influence of Ravel and Debussy. The basis of his work is melody, his rhythms, in Kennedy's view, being unsubtle at times. Vaughan Williams's music {{is often described as}} visionary; Kennedy cites the masque Job and the Fifth and Ninth Symphonies. Vaughan Williams's output was prolific and wide-ranging. For the voice he composed songs, operas, and choral works ranging from simpler pieces suitable for amateurs to demanding works for professional choruses. His comparatively few chamber works are not among his better known compositions. Some of <b>his</b> <b>finest</b> works elude conventional categorisation, such as the Serenade to Music (1938) for sixteen solo singers and orchestra; Flos Campi (1925) for solo viola, small orchestra, and small chorus; and his most important chamber work, in Howes's view—not purely instrumental but a song cycle—On Wenlock Edge (1909) with accompaniment for string quartet and piano.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the release}} of the game, Square Enix has {{published}} the 2011 four-disc soundtrack album, Final Fantasy XIII-2 Original Soundtrack, as well as an album of arrangements and alternate versions of tracks from the game, Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack PLUS, in 2012. The theme song for the game, , was released by singer Mai Fukui as a single in 2011, and the English version of the song, sung by Charice Pempengco and included in the non-Japanese versions of the game, was included on her 2012 album Infinity. Reviews of the soundtrack album were positive, with critics praising both the variety of styles and quality of the pieces. Several critics noted Mizuta's work as possibly <b>his</b> <b>finest</b> to date. Reviewers were mixed in their opinions of the arranged album, feeling that several of the pieces were simply inferior versions of the original tracks.
