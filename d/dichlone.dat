40|$|The {{permeability}} of the Chlorella pyrenoidosa membrane was {{studied by}} following the efflux of 14 C-intracellular material from cells which {{had been allowed to}} incorporate 14 CO 2 photosynthetically. It was observed that the efflux increased upon treatment with low concentrations (3 - 30 μM) of 2, 3 -dichloro- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone (<b>dichlone),</b> 2 -amino- 3 -chloro- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone (06 K-quinone), and 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrachloro- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (chloranil). <b>Dichlone</b> caused a greater loss of intracellular material than chloranil or 06 K-quinone. The rate of loss as well as the total loss of 14 C increased with an increase in the concentration of the quinones. In the dichlone-treated cells, the leakage was observed within 1 minute of the addition of the chemical and the effect on cell permeability was irreversible. Cells exposed to <b>dichlone</b> in the light or under anaerobic conditions released significantly greater amounts of 14 C-material than cells treated in the dark or under aerobic conditions. The aqueous ethanol-soluble fraction of the cell was found to be the source of the released material. The proportion of the ethanol-soluble 14 C that leaked out of the cell varied with the time of 14 C-assimilation prior to treatment with <b>dichlone.</b> In the dichlone-treated cells, practically all the 14 C-sucrose, alanine, glutamine, serine, and glycine leaked out, whereas glutamic, aspartic, succinic, and fumaric acids were lost only partially. Essentially no 14 C-lipids were lost from the cells during <b>dichlone</b> treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} quinone {{herbicides}} and fungicides on photosynthetic reactions in isolated spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplasts was investigated. 2, 3 -Dichloro- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone (<b>dichlone),</b> 2 -amino- 3 -chloro- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone (06 K-quinone), and 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrachloro- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (chloranil) inhibited ferricyanide reduction {{as well as}} ATP formation. Benzoquinone {{had little or no}} effect on these reactions. The two reactions showed a differential sensitivity to these inhibitors. <b>Dichlone</b> was a strong inhibitor of both photosystems I and II; photosystem I was more sensitive to 06 K-quinone than was photosystem II, whereas the reverse was true of chloranil. Chloranil and 06 K-quinone inhibited ferricyanide reduction and the coupled photophosphorylation to the same extent, whereas <b>dichlone</b> affected photophosphorylation {{to a greater extent than}} the ferricyanide reduction...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The voltammetric {{reduction}} behaviour of <b>Dichlone</b> {{has been}} carried out by d. c. polarography, cyclic voltammetry (CV), a. c. polarography and differential pulse polarography (DPP) in methanolic Britton-Robinson buffer of pH ranging 2. 0 - 12. 0. The nature of electrode process was studied, the number of electrons was evaluated and the reduction mechanism was proposed. Quantitive determination was carried out in the concentration range 1. 0 × 10 - 5 M to 2. 5 × 10 - 8 M using a DPP method with a lower detection limit of 2. 0 × 10 - 8 M. The proposed method was successfully applied in the determination of <b>Dichlone</b> in grains, soils and water samples...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} various quinone {{herbicides}} and fungicides on the photosynthetic 14 CO 2 fixation and {{the incorporation of}} 14 C among the products of photosynthesis in Chlorella pyrenoidosa was investigated. Addition of 30 μm 2, 3 -dichloro- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone (<b>dichlone),</b> 2 -amino- 3 -chloro- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone (06 K-quinone), or 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrachloro- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (chloranil) inhibited CO 2 fixation, whereas 1, 4 -benzoquinone had no effect. Treatment with 3 μm or higher concentrations of <b>dichlone,</b> 06 K-quinone or 1, 4 -benzoquinone also produced marked changes {{in the pattern of}} 14 C distribution. A noticeable effect was an increase in the proportion of 14 C in sucrose and glycine accompanied by a reduction in 14 C lipids and glutamic acid. These changes appear to occur as a result of shifts in the flow of carbon along various biosynthetic pathways of photosynthetic CO 2 fixation. It is suggested that inactivation of coenzyme A and shortage of reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide in the quinone-treated cells inhibited the synthesis of lipids and glutamic acid, thereby diverting more carbon into sucrose and glycine...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{discover}} new inhibitors of the DNA methyltransferase 3 A/ 3 L complex, {{we used a}} medium-throughput nonradioactive screen on a random collection of 1120 small organic compounds. After a primary hit detection against DNA methylation activity of the murine Dnmt 3 A/ 3 L catalytic complex, we further evaluated the EC(50) of the 12 most potent hits {{as well as their}} cytotoxicity on DU 145 prostate cancer cultured cells. Interestingly, most of the inhibitors showed low micromolar activities and little cytotoxicity. <b>Dichlone,</b> a small halogenated naphthoquinone, classically used as pesticide and fungicide, showed the lowest EC(50) at 460 nM. We briefly assessed the selectivity of a subset of our new inhibitors against hDNMT 1 and bacterial Dnmts, including M. SssI and EcoDam, and the protein lysine methyltransferase PKMT G 9 a and the mode of inhibition. Globally, the tested molecules showed a clear preference for the DNA methyltransferases, but poor selectivity among them. Two molecules including <b>Dichlone</b> efficiently reactivated YFP gene expression in a stable HEK 293 cell line by promoter demethylation. Their efficacy was comparable to the DNMT inhibitor of reference 5 -azacytidine...|$|E
40|$|The {{endocarp}} of {{the fresh}} pea pod incubated with solution or suspension of agricultural fungicides, phytotoxic metabolites of plant pathogenic fungi formed the pea phytoalexin, pisatin. Among the compounds tested, cycloheximide, triazine, <b>dichlone,</b> phenyimercury acetate, UV degradation product of phenylmercury acetate, triphenyltin fungicides, and 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methylisoxazole induced pisatin. Ophiobolin, a toxin from Cochliobolus mtyabeanus, and ascochitine, a toxic metabolite from Ascochyta fabae, also induced pisatin.

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} spectrophotometric method {{has been developed}} for the estimation of lomefloxacin hydrochloride in its marketed formulations. The method {{is based on the}} reaction between the drug and the <b>dichlone,</b> in the presence of crotonaldehyde in dimethylsulfoxide, which produces a blue chromogen with absorption maximum at 645 nm. The good agreement with Beer&#x 2032;s law was found in the concentration range of 5 - 100 &#x 00 B 5;g/ml. The optimum reaction conditions and other analytical parameters are evaluated. Statistical comparison of the results with those of reported method shows good agreement, and indicated no significant difference in precision.

40|$|Ba c k g r o u n d: Legislation at state, federal, and {{international}} levels is requiring rapid {{evaluation of the}} toxicity of numerous chemicals. Whole-animal toxicologic studies cannot yield the necessary throughput in a cost-effective fashion, leading to a critical need for a faster and more cost-effective toxicologic evaluation of xenobiotics. Objectives: We tested whether mechanistically based screening assays can rapidly provide information on the potential for compounds to affect key enzymes and receptor targets, thus identifying those compounds requiring further in-depth analysis. Met h o d s: A library of 176 synthetic chemicals was prepared and examined in a high-throughput screening (HTS) manner using nine enzyme-based and five receptor-based bioassays. Re s u l t s: All the assays have high Z ´ values, indicating good discrimination among compounds in a reliable fashion, and thus are suitable for HTS assays. On average, three positive hits were obtained per assay. Although we identified compounds that were previously shown to inhibit a particular enzyme class or receptor, we surprisingly discovered that triclosan, a microbiocide present in personal care products, inhibits carboxylesterases and that <b>dichlone,</b> a fungicide, strongly inhibits the ryanodine receptors...|$|E
40|$|Fungicides were {{screened}} for {{ability to control}} needle-cast of Pinus radiata D. Don caused by Cydaneusma minus (Butin) DiCosmo et al. Undetached shoots were dipped in water-based suspensions at fortnightly intervals for 20 months {{from the time of}} flush. Significant improvements in levels of needle retention were achieved with dodine (86 % retention), anilazine (76 %), benomyl (74 %), and <b>dichlone</b> (66 %), in comparison with untreated controls (39 %). Injections of acidified aqueous solutions of carbendazim into stems of 8 - to 10 -year-old trees resulted in reductions in foliage yellowing, needle loss, and numbers of C. minus colonies isolated from the foliage. Needle loss was reduced two- to three-fold on 0 - to 1 -year-old shoots after one season of injections; after 2 consecutive years, of injections needle loss was reduced seven-fold on 1 - to 2 -year-old shoots. Yellowing and defoliation were also reduced by injections of the non-fungicidal compounds ortho-phenylenediamine and L-arginine monohydrochloride, implying that not all the effects of carbendazim are a consequence of its fungicidal properties. Aerial applications of benomyl (0. 25 kg/ha) in an emulsion of water (6 litres/ha) and BP crop oil (4 litres/ha) in June and July failed to check the disease in a 10 -year-old P. radiata plantation...|$|E
