According to the study, India's inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy was {{responsible for most of}} the complaints that business executive <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> country. A paper prepared in 2012 by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions states that corruption is prevalent at all levels in civil services and it is institutionalised.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have also}} noticed that people {{demonstrate}} more optimistic bias when making comparisons {{when the other}} is a vague individual, but biases are reduced when {{the other is a}} familiar person, such as a friend or family member.

25|$|While {{the great}} {{subduction}} events release much energy (around magnitude 9), that energy is {{spread over a}} large area, and largely centered near the coast. The energy of the somewhat smaller Benioff earthquakes is likewise diluted over a relatively large area. The largest intra-crustal earthquakes <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same total energy (which is about one-hundredth of a subduction event), but since they re closer to the surface they will cause more powerful shaking, and, therefore, more damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{adult males}} look {{very similar to}} the females. They <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same body length, and the main {{differences}} include their antennae being completely dark brown, and having hair on the broad yellow plate (clypeus) at the front of their heads. They have more hair in other places as well. Also, their upper hind limbs (femoras) on their median legs are brown with a thin, long, yellow stripe. Lastly, the aedeagus (reproductive organ which is used to secrete sperm) is flattened and inflated at the apex.|$|E

The average density in these home ranges is 0.4 possums per hectare. Females live with one male in their home range, which are {{commonly}} marked by scent posts. To scent-mark, the rock-haunting ringtail possum rubs or presses their cloacal-caudal region or chest against the surface. While the possum also marked rock ledges and trees within its home ranges, scent marking was most vigorous around den sites.|$|E

25|$|Several {{factors are}} {{associated}} with states' decisions to accept or reject Medicaid expansion {{in accordance with the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Partisan composition of state governments is the most significant factor, with states led primarily by Democrats tending to expand Medicaid and states led primarily by Republicans tending to reject expansion. Other important factors include the generosity of the Medicaid program in a given state prior to 2010, spending on elections by health care providers, and the attitudes people in a given state tend to <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> role of government and the perceived beneficiaries of expansion.|$|E
25|$|After Suez, American Secretary of State John Foster Dulles {{perceived}} {{that there was}} a power vacuum in the Middle East, and thought the United States should fill it.

This was not in fact the case, and Nasser hated Israel far more than whatever reservations he might <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, and in any case preferred a situation where both superpower were competing for his favour instead of him becoming aligned with one superpower.|$|E
25|$|The {{youngest}} rock units {{consist of}} rough terra and smooth plains materials. Rough terra occurs as overlapping and intermixed ejecta blankets around dusters of large young craters {{in the eastern}} part of the quadrangle. The relief here appears to be higher than elsewhere in the map area, and the occurrence of dense arrays of fresh secondary craters produces a coarsely textured, hummocky surface at a scale of about 10–20km. The effect of roughness is highlighted by the low sun illumination angle. Ordinarily, rough terra material would be subdivided and mapped as individual ejecta blankets around and belonging to particular craters. In this eastern region, however, the closely grouped craters <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same age, and it has not been possible to distinguish the boundaries between their aprons in many places.|$|E

25|$|The {{application}} of Newton's law of gravity has enabled {{the acquisition of}} much of the detailed information we <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> planets in the Solar System, the mass of the Sun, and details of quasars; even the existence of dark matter is inferred using Newton's law of gravity. Although we have not traveled to all the planets nor to the Sun, we know their masses. These masses are obtained by applying the laws of gravity to the measured characteristics of the orbit. In space an object maintains its orbit because of the force of gravity acting upon it. Planets orbit stars, stars orbit galactic centers, galaxies orbit a center of mass in clusters, and clusters orbit in superclusters. The force of gravity exerted on one object by another is directly proportional to the product of those objects' masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the health}} {{services}} that exist, {{there are serious}} problems and deficiencies. As of 1997, life expectancy in the state was 71.5 years, 9 years higher than in 1990. The death rate has decreased from 5.79 deaths per thousand to 5.14. While much of Mexico's health care system struggles to meet needs, the system in Oaxaca, one of the country's poorest states, has it particularly bad. The relatively prosperous state of Nuevo León has 3,207 hospital beds, while Oaxaca has only 1,760, {{despite the fact that}} the two states <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same population. There is about the same ratio of doctors between the two states. Forty four percent of pregnant women receive pre-natal care from people who are not medically qualified. 70 women each year die from complications from pregnancy and childbirth, and most of these are avoidable, due to bleeding and eclampsia. For every 100,000 live births in Oaxaca, there are 95.1 maternal deaths, over the national average of 63.3, putting the state in the top five.|$|E
25|$|Element 118, oganesson, is {{the last}} element that has been synthesized. The next two {{elements}}, elements 119 and 120, should form an 8s series and be an alkali and alkaline earth metal respectively. Beyond element 120, the superactinide series is expected to begin, when the 8s electrons and the filling 8p1/2, 7d3/2, 6f5/2, and 5g7/2 subshells determine the chemistry of these elements. Complete and accurate CCSD calculations are not available for elements beyond 122 because of the extreme complexity of the situation: the 5g, 6f, and 7d orbitals should <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same energy level, and {{in the region of}} element 160 the 9s, 8p3/2, and 9p1/2 orbitals should also be about equal in energy. This will cause the electron shells to mix so that the block concept no longer applies very well, and will also result in novel chemical properties that will make positioning these elements in a periodic table very difficult. For example, element 164 is expected to mix characteristics of the elements of group 10, 12, 14, and 18.|$|E

500|$|Eta Carinae A is {{classified}} as a luminous blue variable (LBV) due to the distinctive spectral and brightness variations. This type of variable star is characterised by irregular changes from a high temperature quiescent state to a low temperature outburst state at roughly constant luminosity. LBVs in the quiescent state lie on a narrow S Doradus instability strip, with more luminous stars being hotter. In outburst all LBVs <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same temperature, which is near 8,000K.

500|$|Throughout {{the first}} years of her career, Carey's musical styles mainly {{involved}} pop influenced R. Additionally, her image was of a reserved and modestly dressed female, or as Carey's later described it [...] "the 90s version of Mary Poppins". As the 1990s wore on, Carey began featuring rappers on remixes, and began infusing hip-hop into her musical palette. As her music changed, so too did her image, which became more sexual, and aimed at younger audiences than the more contemporary appeal of her earlier works. According to Michael Paoletta from Billboard, [...] "Through the Rain" [...] was used not only as a vehicle for listeners to become more in-tune with Carey's personal struggles, but also as a means to [...] "re-capture" [...] her audience throughout the earlier stages of her career. A contemporary and pop ballad, he felt the song would find [...] "much embrace" [...] from her older fans, while her audience that grew accustomed to her hip-hop flavored music would feel [...] "lost and abandoned". In an interview with MTV News, the song's co-producer Jimmy Jam described why Carey chose to release it as the lead single: [...] "I think 'Through the Rain' {{is a great way to}} start the record, because it is emotional and it kind of speaks directly to the questions people might <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> last year of her life. It's a good idea to get that out of the way and move on to happy, less emotional songs." ...|$|E

[...] Game Informer and Next Generation agreed that the plot {{was one of the}} game's highlights, the former drawing comparisons to Star Wars, Star Blazers, the Old Testament, and many other Square games, making it [...] "a game every RPG fanatic must play." [...] IGN said the storyline is intricate, engrossing, [...] "deep, complex, {{and once in a while}} even confusing, until more of the real underlying plotline is uncovered." [...] GameSpot said the story is [...] "excellent" [...] and [...] "thought-provoking" [...] but said it can be [...] "a little preachy at times", but went on to say that the religious and existential themes [...] "enhance the story and [...] understanding of the game's deep characterizations". Game Revolution described the storyline as [...] "epic" [...] and [...] "fabulous" [...] with [...] "many twists and turns" [...] and a large cast of characters. RPGFan said [...] "the story is unique and probably the most complex and interesting of any RPG", giving it a 99% rating for the story. Retrospectively, Edge praised the plot's scope and ambition and the protagonist as the [...] "most complicated Freudian hero" [...] in video games, but said it has a [...] "flawed" [...] script and [...] "muddied" [...] translation, as well as too many cut scenes, especially on the second disc, where the use of the world map is restricted for an extended period and the amount of cut scenes increases. Years after the game's release, Jeremy Parish of Electronic Gaming Monthly called the game's plot [...] "one of the wackiest game plotlines ever", but said that it [...] "actually makes sense" [...] if the player ignores all of the sideplots.
