50|$|In May 1992 at the {{recommendation}} of the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Atlantic Command (USCINCLANT), CAPT Wilson was nominated for the flag-rank billet of USCINCLANT Director of Intelligence, J-2. He was subsequently chosen for that assignment and later that year selected by the Navy for promotion to Rear Admiral (Lower Half). RDML Wilson served as the CINCLANT J2 until November 1994, a period of time that was highlighted by the interdiction of unprecedentedly large Haitian and Cuban refugee boat flotillas toward United States territorial waters and the construction and occupation of equally unprecedented refugee camps in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; training for, deployment and execution of a USCINCLANT-led military intervention in Haiti; the implementation of many of the Desert Storm “lessons-learned” for enhanced electronic intelligence dissemination to operating forces; the transfer of most “echelon-above-corps” intelligence support resources from the military services to the combatant commands; and the transition of the United States Atlantic Command (USLANTCOM) mission from the near-total focus on its geographic area of responsibility to equal focus on joint force packaging, doctrine and training. This resulted in significant intelligence re-alignments and focus, as well the command being known as USACOM vs. USLANTCOM. Under Wilson’s leadership, USCINCLANT Intelligence conducted development and initial operational use of new intelligence dissemination and communications capability, along with the creation of the initial Joint Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTP) documents that governed their introduction into current operations. These capabilities included Atlantic Command versions of what would eventually become the widely <b>distributed</b> <b>Joint</b> Deployable Intelligence Support System (JDISS) and Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (JWICS). Both of these Atlantic Command-developed systems were used to provide intelligence support to operational forces engaged in the Haiti intervention in 1994. In what was to become standard operating procedure later in the 90’s and throughout {{the first decade of the}} 2000s, the Haiti intervention featured the first use of JWICS in a command and control function, including regular JWICS teleconferences between the President, Secretary of Defense, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, USCINCLANT and all of his component commanders (Forces Command, Air Combat Command, CINCLANTFLT, and COMARFORLANT), and operational commanders Haiti JTF Commander/18th Airborne Corps Commander/US SECOND Fleet Commander (all co-embarked on USS MOUNT WHITNEY), 10TH Mountain Division (embarked on USS DWIGHT D.

Our aim is {{the design of}} an efficient coding scheme for stereoscopic video communication over noisy channels that preserves the perceived visual quality while guaranteeing a low computational complexity.

This paper presents an approach to designing <b>distributed</b> <b>joint</b> source-channel (DJSC) codes for encoding correlated binary sources over a two-user GMAC, using systematic irregular low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. The degree profile defining the LDPC code is optimized for the joint source probabilities using extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) analysis and linear programming. A key issue addressed is the Gaussian modeling of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) generated by nodes representing the joint source probabilities in the combined factor graph of the two LDPC codes, referred to as source-channel factor (SCF) nodes. It is shown that the analytical expressions based on additive combining of incoming LLRs, as done in variable nodes and parity check nodes of the graph of a single LDPC code, cannot be used with SCF nodes. To this end, we propose a numerical approach based on Monte-Carlo simulations to fit a Gaussian density to outgoing LLRs from the SCF nodes, which makes the EXIT analysis of the joint decoder tractable. Experimental results are presented which show that LDPC codes designed with the proposed approach outperforms previously reported DJSC codes for GMAC. Furthermore, they demonstrate that when the sources are strongly dependent, the proposed DJSC codes can achieve code rates higher than the theoretical upper-bound for separate source and channel coding...|$|E

A shell element model, a beam element model, and two solid element models were established to investigate the effects of bolted joints and element types on low-order vibration modes of the compressor.
