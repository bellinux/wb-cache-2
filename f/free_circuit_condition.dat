Through this process, a general comparison is drawn out between the performance of either route in dealing with fault diagnosis of circuits. An illustrative example is considered, on which both the fuzzy and neural algorithms are tested, and their performance in fault diagnosis is compared. Further, the suitability of the fuzzy and neural techniques to various kinds of diagnosis problems depending upon the nature of data available is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Generally, routing {{methods can}} be {{implemented}} using centralized and decentralized methods. In order to improve the efficiency of a telecommunications network, we want a routing method to have the advantages of both centralized routing - optimal decision and decentralized routing - fast and less work load. The neural network routing uses the centralized routing as teacher, such that it can control with only the local information. We study the learning process of the neural network and use the Estimation and Maximization (EM) algorithm for learning. The result shows some improvements of neural network over previous work, {{and the performance of}} the improved neural network routing is almost the same as the EM algorithm of one hierarchy. By comparing different routing methods: Simplex Routing, Maximum <b>Free</b> <b>Circuit</b> Routing, Neural Routing, <b>Free</b> <b>Circuit</b> Ratio Routing, we can see that neural routing is better than typical decentralized routing.

40|$|We {{study the}} carbon {{nanotube}} Schottky barrier at the metallic electrode interface in polarized gases using an equivalent circuit model. The gas-nanotube interaction is often weak {{and very little}} charge transfer is expected [l]. This is the case with'oxygen, but the gas-electrode interaction is appreciable and makes the oxygen molecules negatively charged. In the closed <b>circuit</b> <b>condition,</b> screening positive charges appear in the nanotube {{as well as in}} the electrode, and the Schottky barrier is modulated due to the resultant electrostatic effects [2]. In the case of ammonia, both the gas-nanotube and gas-electrode interactions are weak, but the Schottky barrier can still be modulated since the molecules are polarized and align in the preferred orientation within the gap between the electrode and nanotube in the open <b>circuit</b> <b>condition</b> (dipole layer formation). In the closed <b>circuit</b> <b>condition,</b> an electric field appears in the gap and strengthens or weakens the preferred dipole alignment reflecting the nanotube Fermi level.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a five-phase permanent-magnet (PM) motor is analyzed under postfault conditions. Proper current control strategies are adopted {{so as to guarantee}} safe drive operation after any fault occurrence. This paper covers three fault types: the open <b>circuit</b> <b>condition</b> of a single phase, the open <b>circuit</b> <b>condition</b> of two nonadjacent phases, and the open <b>circuit</b> <b>condition</b> of two adjacent phases. Two motors with two different windings (with double and single layers, respectively) are compared under each fault type. This paper aims to highlight the difference in the motor {{performance of}} motors adopting these two different windings. A further novelty of this paper is that the proper current control strategies are derived analytically, including not only the fundamental harmonic of the flux-density distribution but also the higher harmonics. It is shown that these harmonics cause high torque oscillations. Owing to this analytical approach, the strategy can be applied to a variety of PM motors. In addition, the postfault current waveforms remain sinusoidal, making the current control easier. For each fault type, the results of both simulations and experimental tests are included. A good match between analytical predictions and experimental tests validates the proposed current control strategies...|$|R
