5|$|In August 2011, the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) {{designated}} the entire Western Ghats as an <b>Ecologically</b> <b>Sensitive</b> <b>Area</b> (ESA) and assigned {{three levels of}} Ecological Sensitivity to its different regions. The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel, headed by ecologist Madhav Gadgil, was a committee appointed by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests to assess the biodiversity and environmental issues of the Western Ghats. Gadgil Committee and its successor Kasturirangan Committee recommended suggestions to protect the Western Ghats. Gadgil report was criticized as being too environment-friendly and Kasturirangan report was labelled as being anti-environmental.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{enlighten}} land re-distribution in Yibin City, between {{land use and}} soil and water loss in Yibin City were explored {{with the support of}} GIS technology.

So the goal of land re-distribution is to avoid locating strong human activities in the <b>ecologically</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas</b> or to use land in these areas in a way which can withstand the sensitivity. The paper also find that the primary model, of spatial re-distribution of land use is to adjust the land use structure and use land in a more efficient way...|$|R
