The fact that relational schemas contain information about the self and information about others <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>previous</b> conceptions of working models. The unique contribution of relational schemas to working models is {{the information about the}} way interactions with attachments usually unfold. Relational schemas add the if–then statements about interactions to working models. To demonstrate that working models are organized as relational schemas, Baldwin and colleagues created a set of written scenarios that described interactions dealing with trust, dependency and closeness.

50|$|Early {{models of}} Mira stars {{assumed that the}} star {{remained}} spherically symmetric during this process (largely to keep the computer modelling simple, rather than for physical reasons). A recent survey of Mira variable stars found that 75% of the Mira stars which could be resolved using the IOTA telescope are not spherically symmetric, a result which <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>previous</b> images of individual Mira stars, so there is now pressure to do realistic three-dimensional modelling of Mira stars on supercomputers.|$|E

50|$|Geoneutrino {{detectors}} {{can detect}} {{the decay of}} 238U and 232Th and thus allow estimation of their contribution to the present radiogenic heat budget, while 235U is unobserved, and 40K is not detectable but is known to contribute 4 TW of heating. However, the decay of 235U and 40K contributed a large fraction of radiogenic heat flux to the early Earth, which was also much hotter than at present. Initial results from measuring the geoneutrino products of radioactive decay from within the Earth, a proxy for radiogenic heat, yielded a new estimate of half of the total Earth internal heat source being radiogenic, and this <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>previous</b> estimates.|$|E

50|$|The {{number of}} {{part-time}} workers jumped during 2008 and 2009 {{as a result}} of the recession, while the number of full-time workers fell. This pattern <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>previous</b> recessions. From November 2007 to January 2010, the number of part-time workers increased by 3.0 million (from 24.8 million to 27.8 million), while the number of full-time workers fell by 11.3 million (from 121.9 million to 110.6 million). Between 2010 and May 2016, the number of part-time workers fluctuated between approximately 27-28 million, while the number of full-time workers recovered steadily to 123.1 million, above the pre-crisis peak. In other words, nearly all of the post-recession job creation was full-time.|$|E
50|$|SMA in {{the monkey}} brain may {{emphasize}} locomotion, especially complex locomotion such as climbing or leaping. This suggestion {{was based on}} studies in which stimulation on a behaviorally relevant time scale evoked complex, full body movements that resembled climbing or leaping. This hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>previous</b> hypotheses, including the involvement of SMA in postural stabilization, in internally generated movements, in bimanual coordination, and in the planning of movement sequences, because all of these functions are heavily recruited in complex locomotion. The locomotion hypothesis {{is an example of}} interpreting the motor cortex in terms of the underlying behavioral repertoire from which abstract control functions emerge, an approach emphasized by Graziano and colleagues.|$|E
5000|$|Approximately 92% {{of women}} feel {{pressure}} {{to conform to}} the standards of beauty which the media perpetuates. After viewing images of women with [...] "ideal" [...] body weights, 95% of women overestimate their body size and 40% overestimate the size of their waist, hips, cheeks, or thighs. Those with eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, show a significant increase in overestimation of body size after viewing such images. Similarly males who are exposed to body-related advertisements show an increase in body dissatisfaction and depression. [...] Men shown advertisements containing images of exceptionally muscular men were shown to be dissatisfied with their own musculature, not their body fat, after viewing such advertisements.
