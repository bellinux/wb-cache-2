5|$|The {{heterodyne}} technique {{is used for}} (1) shifting an <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> into a new frequency range as well as (2) amplifying a weak <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> (assuming use of an active mixer). A weak <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> of frequency f1 is mixed with a strong reference frequency f2 from a local oscillator (LO). The nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals, one at the sum f1+f2 of the two frequencies, and the other at the difference f1−f2. These new frequencies are called heterodynes. Typically {{only one of the}} new frequencies is desired, and the other signal is filtered out of the output of the mixer. The output signal will have an intensity proportional to the product of the amplitudes of the input signals.|$|E
5|$|Some active subwoofers use a servo {{feedback}} mechanism {{based on}} cone movement which modifies the signal {{sent to the}} voice coil. The servo feedback signal is derived from {{a comparison of the}} <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> to the amplifier versus the actual motion of the cone. The usual source of the feedback signal is a few turns of voice coil attached to the cone or a microchip-based accelerometer placed on the cone itself. An advantage of a well-implemented servo subwoofer design is reduced distortion making smaller enclosure sizes possible. The primary disadvantages are cost and complexity.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} basic {{mechanisms}} of hysteretic delay and noise margin variations for floating-body Partially-Depleted SOI CMOS domino circuits in detail. Three cases, {{based on whether}} the <b>input</b> <b>signals</b> are “domino <b>input</b> <b>signals</b> ” from other domino circuits; “static <b>input</b> <b>signals</b> ” from static circuits or latches; {{or a combination of}} “domino and static <b>input</b> <b>signals</b> ” are examined and differentiated. It is shown that hysteretic delay variation is larger and noise margin worse for the later case with “mixed domino and static <b>input</b> <b>signals.</b> ” Although the delay and noise margin disparities between the three types of <b>input</b> <b>signals</b> are significant at beginning of the clock cycles, they converge as the circuit approaches steadystate...|$|R

25|$|To achieve optimum noise {{performance}} DFAs are {{operated under}} {{a significant amount}} of gain compression (10dB typically), since that reduces the rate of spontaneous emission, thereby reducing ASE. Another advantage of operating the DFA in the gain saturation region is that small fluctuations in the <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> power are reduced in the output amplified signal: smaller <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> powers experience larger (less saturated) gain, while larger input powers see less gain.|$|E
25|$|The {{dictionary}} learning framework, {{namely the}} linear decomposition of an <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> using a few basis elements learned from data itself, {{has led to}} state-of-art results in various image and video processing tasks. This technique {{can be applied to}} classification problems in a way that if we have built specific dictionaries for each class, the <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> can be classified by finding the dictionary corresponding to the sparsest representation.|$|E
25|$|A peak-sensing {{compressor}} {{responds to}} the instantaneous level of the <b>input</b> <b>signal.</b> While providing tighter peak control, peak sensing might yield very quick changes in gain reduction, more evident compression or sometimes even distortion. Some compressors apply an averaging function (commonly root mean square or RMS) on the <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> before comparing its level to the threshold. This produces a more relaxed compression that more closely relates to human perception of loudness.|$|E

By recursive use of this algorithm, extraction of all <b>input</b> <b>signals</b> can be achieved...|$|R
25|$|If two {{equivalent}} amplifiers {{are being}} compared, the amplifier with higher gain settings {{would be more}} sensitive as it would take less <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> to produce a given amount of power.|$|E
25|$|If a kernel is non-negative, such {{as for a}} Gaussian kernel, {{then the}} value of the {{filtered}} signal will be a convex combination of the input values (the coefficients (the kernel) integrate to 1, and are non-negative), and will thus fall between the minimum and maximum of the <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> – it will not undershoot or overshoot. If, on the other hand, the kernel assumes negative values, such as the sinc function, then {{the value of the}} filtered signal will instead be an affine combination of the input values, and may fall outside of the minimum and maximum of the <b>input</b> <b>signal,</b> resulting in undershoot and overshoot, as in the Gibbs phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|It {{also has}} {{properties}} that {{are useful for}} signal denoising since usually one can learn a dictionary to represent the meaningful part of the <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> in a sparse way but the noise in the input will have a much less sparse representation.|$|E

25|$|Although the DFA is {{essentially}} a polarization independent amplifier, {{a small proportion of}} the dopant ions interact preferentially with certain polarizations and a small dependence on the polarization of the <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> may occur (typically < 0.5nbsp&dB).

25|$|Positive {{feedback}} {{occurs when}} the fed-back signal is in phase with the <b>input</b> <b>signal.</b> Under certain gain conditions, positive feedback reinforces the <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> {{to the point where}} the output of the device oscillates between its maximum and minimum possible states. Positive feedback may also introduce hysteresis into a circuit. This can cause the circuit to ignore small signals and respond only to large ones. It is sometimes used to eliminate noise from a digital signal. Under some circumstances, positive feedback may cause a device to latch, i.e., to reach a condition in which the output is locked to its maximum or minimum state. This fact is very widely used in digital electronics to make bistable circuits for volatile storage of information.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to understand that when the compressor is lowering the signal to the desired ratio it is lowering the entire signal, so that the compressor is still working even after the <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> has fallen below the threshold, for an amount of time determined by the release.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a cumulant-based {{method for}} blind {{deconvolution}} of a multi-input multi-output system is proposed. The {{core of the}} method is an algorithm which extracts one of the <b>input</b> <b>signals</b> using the output signals as data only. This algorithm is a non-trivial generalization of the Shalvi-Weinstein algorithm for single-input single-output blind deconvolution and converges in super-exponential rate after {{a finite number of}} iterations. By using this algorithm recursively, all the <b>input</b> <b>signals</b> can be extracted. In its basic form, the algorithm applies when the <b>input</b> <b>signals</b> are non-Gaussian independent identical distributed. The algorithm is also extended to the case where the <b>input</b> <b>signals</b> are general regular processes. Computer simulation results are presented to demonstrate the convergence behavior of the proposed method as well as its efficacy for blind deconvolution. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V.
