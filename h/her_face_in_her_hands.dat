2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is an array of love songs, with songs such as [...] "My Boy" [...] and [...] "Girl" [...] portraying Duffy in a {{protective}} manner, with respect to her lover. On [...] "Breath Away", Duffy laments that her lover is [...] "taking her breath away." [...] "Hard for the Heart" [...] questions the difficulties involved with falling in love. Elsewhere, Duffy also took inspiration from her own life experiences. [...] "Too Hurt to Dance" [...] was subconsciously written about Duffy's friend who [...] "lost her mum aged ten". Duffy continued, [...] "she told me they played [...] "Unchained Melody" [...] at her mum's funeral. I now realise my lyric comes from seeing my friend at the school disco, shaking, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> while the other kids were smooching to this song". The following track, [...] "Keeping My Baby" [...] was written in a similar way, as Duffy only released the song is {{about the fact that}} [...] "one aunt told her she'd end up a single mother on benefits", as it is [...] "sung {{from the point of view}} of a pregnant girl".|$|E
