5|$|The {{return of}} royal burials to Thebes {{after the end}} of the Amarna period marks a change to the layout of royal burials, with the {{intermediate}} 'jogged axis' gradually giving way to the 'straight axis' of later dynasties. In the Western Valley, there is a tomb commencement that is thought to have been started for Akhenaten, but it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> gateway and a series of steps. The tomb of Ay, Tutankhamun's successor is close by. It is likely that this tomb was started for Tutankhamun (its decoration is of a similar style) but later usurped for Ay's burial. This would mean that KV62 may have been Ay's original tomb, which would explain the smaller size and unusual layout for a royal tomb.|$|E

25|$|The {{first and}} {{earliest}} view of Jesus in Islamic thought {{is that of}} a prophet; a human being chosen by God to present both a judgement upon humanity for worshipping idols and a challenge to turn to the one, true God, is foundational for all Muslims. From this basis reflected upon all previous prophets through the lens of Muslim identity, Jesus <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> messenger repeating the same message of the ages. Jesus is not traditionally perceived as divine, yet Muslim ideology is careful not to view Jesus as less than this, for in doing so would be sacrilegious and similar to rejecting a recognized Islamic prophet. The miracles of Jesus and the Qur'anic titles attributed to Jesus demonstrate the power of God rather than the divinity of Jesus—the same power behind the message of all prophets.|$|E
25|$|The {{inspiration}} for Thrushcross Grange {{has long been}} traced to Ponden Hall, near Haworth, which is very small. Shibden Hall, near Halifax, is perhaps more likely. The Thrushcross Grange that Emily describes is rather unusual. It sits within an enormous park, as does Shibden Hall. By comparison, the park at Chatsworth (the home of the Duke of Devonshire) is over two miles (3.2km) long but, as the house sits near the middle, it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> {{mile and a half}} (2.4km) from the lodge to the house. Considering that Edgar Linton apparently does not even have a title, this seems unlikely. There is no building close to Haworth that has a park anywhere near this size, {{but there are a few}} houses that might have inspired some elements. Shibden Hall has several features that match descriptions in the novel.|$|E

After Hitler leaves the conference room, Weidling firmly asks if it is truly possible for Wenck to attack; the generals all {{agree that it is}} impossible, but still resolve to never surrender. After midnight, Hitler dictates his last will and testament to Traudl, before marrying Eva Braun. Hitler orders Goebbels to leave Berlin, but Goebbels refuses.

500|$|It {{has been}} {{thought in the}} past that tornadoes moved almost {{exclusively}} in a northeasterly direction. This is false, and a potentially deadly myth which can lead to a false sense of security, especially for unaware spotters or chasers. Although the majority of tornadoes move northeast, this is normally due to the motion of the storm, and tornadoes can arrive from any direction. The expectation of northeasterly travel may be accurate in many cases, but <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> statistical observation about tornadoes in general that any particular tornado may defy at any time. A deadly F5 tornado that hit the city of Jarrell, Texas in 1997 moved to the southwest - directly opposite of commonly expected storm motion. Additionally, tornadoes can shift without notice due to storm motion changes or effects on the tornado itself from factors such as its rear flank downdraft. [...] This change of direction proved deadly in the 2013 El Reno, OK tornado in which a 2.6 mile wide tornado shifted from an east direction to a northeast direction killing at least 4 storm chasers.|$|E

From the amendment's repeal in 1985 to 1992 the U.S. {{government}} gave Savimbi $60million per year, a total of $420million. A sizable amount of the aid went to Savimbi's personal expenses. Black, Manafort filed foreign lobbying records with the U.S. Justice Department showing Savimbi's expenses during his U.S. visits. During his December 1990 visit he spent $136,424 at the Park Hyatt hotel and $2,705 in tips. He spent almost $473,000 in October 1991 during his week-long visit to Washington and Manhattan. He spent $98,022 in hotel bills, at the Park Hyatt, $26,709 in limousine rides in Washington and another $5,293 in Manhattan. Paul Manafort, a partner in the firm, charged Savimbi $19,300 in consulting and additional $1,712 in expenses. He also bought $1,143 worth of [...] "survival kits" [...] from Motorola.

500|$|Burwell and Fleming say the book's subtext {{is about}} aging, as {{symbolized by the}} writer's {{attraction}} to the younger fertile woman, and Hemingway used fertility imagery to symbolize [...] "the aging writer's anxiety {{about his ability to}} write". [...] The images of the old elephant symbolize the aging and unproductive writer, and Burwell approves Patrick Hemingway's decision to retain those pieces of the manuscript. Hemingway scholar Hilary Justice writes the work shows an emphasis on [...] "the writer not writing", [...] which for Hemingway would have been a fate worse than aging. Thus, she says, True at First Light invokes a paradox with [...] "an aging writer for whom writing is becoming increasingly difficult in the moment of writing about the not-writing author". Writing, for Hemingway, had always been difficult. He revised his work endlessly and stuck to the practice of writing [...] "one true sentence" [...] and stopping each writing session when he still had more to write. Tom Jenks, editor of an earlier posthumously published book The Garden of Eden, says Hemingway shows the worst of his writing in True at First Light: presenting himself as a [...] "self-pitying, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing" [...] persona in a book that <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> mass of fragmentary material. Jenks thinks Hemingway is simply aimlessly writing and the plot lacks the tension notable in his earliest works such as The Sun Also Rises. However, he thinks Hemingway had good material to work with and some skeletal thematic structures show promise.|$|E
500|$|In {{the opinion}} of Kathryn Griffith, [...] "The {{importance}} of Learned Hand's philosophy in terms of practical application to the courts lies generally in {{his view of the}} pragmatic origin of all law, but most specifically in his unique interpretation of the Bill of Rights." [...] Hand proposed that the Bill of Rights was not law at all but a set of [...] "admonitory" [...] principles to ensure the fair exercise of constitutional powers. He therefore opposed the use of its [...] "due process of law" [...] clauses as a pretext for national intervention in state legislation. He even advocated the removal of those clauses from the Constitution. In Hand's analysis, [...] "due process" [...] <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> stock phrase to cover a long tradition of common law procedure. He contended that the term had inflated in scope beyond the meaning intended in the Bill of Rights. The result was the misuse of due process to invade rights that the Constitution was designed to protect. For Hand, a law passed by an elected body should be presumed to meet the test of due process. A court that decides otherwise and strikes down such a law is acting undemocratically. Hand maintained this stance even when the Supreme Court struck down anti-liberal laws that he detested. His reasoning has never been widely accepted. Critics of his position included his colleague on the Second Circuit, Jerome Frank, who wrote: [...] "t seems to me that here, most uncharacteristically, Judge Hand indulges in a judgement far too sweeping, one which rests on a too-sharp either-or, all or nothing, dichotomy. ...Obviously the courts cannot do the whole job. But just as obviously, they can sometimes help to arrest evil popular trends at their inception." ...|$|E

Watching her try to look like Marilyn Monroe and sound like Betty Boop, though, is {{a sure sign that}} this film was a disaster in the making. At the same time, it seems inconceivable that anyone would sit down and plan something so dreadful." [...] Carole Kass of the Richmond Times-Dispatch felt that since [...] "Madonna is the idol of teen-agers. If they imitate her hair and her makeup, these 'wanna-bes' who want to be like Madonna and dress like Madonna may be cute. But, as a popular personality, Madonna has a responsibility to her fans. And shoplifting is something not to promote. Nor is smoking." [...] Dan Dinicola of The Schenectady Gazette felt that [...] "Who's That Girl is not simply an awful film, it is positively unbearable. It's a movie without a head or a brain, a picture of such crass stupidity that it can't even make you angry. Instead it numbs you to death with its moronic platitudes, its pretensions to comedy. [...] It's a vanity project which is so amateurly produced and conceived that it makes you want to cringe in shame. [...] Madonna <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> novelty item."
