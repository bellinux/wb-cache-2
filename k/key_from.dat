5|$|In {{addition}} to level keys, every level has one Primagen Key. The six Primagen Keys unlock {{the gate to}} the final boss in the hub area and require the player to use talismans to collect them. Talismans grant Turok special powers, such as allowing him to jump long distances or walk over lava. To use the power of a talisman, the player must collect a feather in a level and then take it to the talisman chamber from that level. There are five talismans in the game and every level, except for the first one, features a feather and a talisman chamber. The Primagen <b>key</b> <b>from</b> one particular level usually requires the player to use the talisman from the next level, except for the Primagen <b>key</b> <b>from</b> the last level, which requires the player to use four talismans. Therefore, the player needs to re-enter some levels more than once to collect all Primagen keys and complete the game.|$|E

5|$|Shortly afterwards, Bruno and George {{arrive at}} the same theatre, {{following}} Bruno's device to an energy source he was tracing. George decides to break in, finding Susarro, Petra, and Flap (who survived {{falling out of the}} train in Shadows of the Templars) interrogating Nico about her investigations; George quickly rescues her when Flap is left on his own with her, knocking him out in the process. After the pair reveal what led them to crossing paths with each other, they decide to continue searching the theatre, looking for the source of the energy Bruno detected. In the process, they find two keys - one in a safe, which is made of stone and decorated with crystals, and was the energy source Bruno detected, while the other, a stone, is found in a weird chamber, within a column of energy, bearing an omega symbol on it. Heading outside, after escaping from Susarro and Petra (who had been dealing with a mysterious, hooded man), George is tazed by an unknown assailant, who takes the strange energy <b>key</b> <b>from</b> him.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} Luigi having won a mansion in a contest. Despite not having entered any contest, he {{promptly}} told Mario about the mansion, {{and the two}} agreed to meet up outside it that evening. Luigi takes a flashlight {{with him and he}} follows the map to the mansion. Upon finally arriving at his new mansion, which looks much more sinister than the supplied photo, Mario is nowhere to be found. Luigi proceeds inside the mansion, entering the Parlor after he gains the <b>key</b> <b>from</b> a strange ghost-like shape. Upon entry, he is soon assaulted by a Gold Ghost, only to be saved by a little old man wielding a vacuum cleaner. The old man, however, is unable to reel in the ghost and is soon overpowered. After being helped to his feet by Luigi, the old man introduces himself as Professor Elvin Gadd. The two retreat from the mansion when more of the Gold Ghosts appear.|$|E

She lets down two long braids, allowing the Harajuku Girls to scale the building and cut off the braids. They meet Akon at a parking lot, and Stefani drives off with him. They are pursued {{by two of the}} Harajuku Girls as police officers, and the video closes with Stefani back in jail after two hours of chasing. The video is intercut with sequences of Stefani and Akon in front of a letter G in lights.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1882 Daimler moved to Cannstatt just outside of Stuttgart at that time, {{purchasing}} a cottage in Cannstatt's Taubenheimstrasse, with 75,000 Gold marks from the compensation from Deutz-AG. Maybach followed in September of that year. In the garden, they added a brick extension to the roomy glass-fronted summer house and this became their workshop. Their activities alarmed the neighbors who reported them to the police as suspected counterfeiters. The police obtained a <b>key</b> <b>from</b> the gardener and raided the house in their absence, but found only engines.|$|E

The faun gives Ofelia a mandrake root, which eases Carmen's illness. Accompanied by three fairy guides, Ofelia then completes the second task—retrieving a dagger from the lair of the Pale Man, a child-eating monster. Although she was warned not to consume anything there, she eats two grapes, awakening the Pale Man. He eats two of the fairies and chases Ofelia, but she manages to escape. Infuriated at her disobedience, the faun refuses to give Ofelia the third task.|$|E
25|$|Chigurh then ruthlessly tracks Moss down. The hotel {{confrontation}} between Moss and Chigurh plays out very {{differently in the}} film from the novel; rather than punching out the lock and wounding Moss, in the novel Chigurh apparently steals a <b>key</b> <b>from</b> a murdered clerk and quietly enters Moss's room, and Moss ambushes him and takes him captive at gunpoint, {{so they have a}} chance to see and know each other. Then Moss runs and the chase/shootout begins. As Chigurh and Moss face off in the hotel and the streets, they are interrupted by a group of Mexicans, all of whom Chigurh kills. In the film, this scene was cut to the point that only Moss and Chigurh fight.|$|E

25|$|What is now Virginia Key was the {{southern}} end of a barrier island that extended from the New River inlet in Fort Lauderdale to just north of Key Biscayne. Early accounts by Spanish explorers indicated the existence of one or more inlets somewhere on the long spit of land enclosing the northern end of Biscayne Bay, but such inlets open and close over time. At the beginning of the 19th century, there was no inlet through the barrier island between the New River Inlet and Bear Cut, at the northern end of Key Biscayne. Hurricanes in 1835 and 1838 opened a new inlet, Narrows Cut (now known as Norris Cut), separating Virginia <b>Key</b> <b>from</b> what is now Fisher Island {{at the south end of}} Miami Beach.|$|E
25|$|The {{aftermath}} of a Jigsaw game is discovered by a SWAT team. The victim, Troy, was meant to rip chains from his body in order to escape from a bomb. Lieutenant Daniel Rigg calls Detectives Mark Hoffman and Allison Kerry to the scene. Kerry, who is guilt-ridden over the disappearance of Eric, {{points out that the}} room's only exit was welded shut, breaking Jigsaw's modus operandi of giving his victims a chance to survive. That night, while reviewing the videotape, she is abducted and awakens in a harness that is hooked into her ribs. Kerry manages to retrieve the <b>key</b> <b>from</b> a suspended beaker of acid and unlock it before the timer expires, but it tears her rib cage apart anyway, killing her.|$|E
25|$|After Houdini's death, {{his friend}} Martin Beck {{was quoted in}} Will Goldston's book, Sensational Tales of Mystery Men, as admitting that Houdini was bested that day and had appealed to his wife, Bess, for help.

It was stated in the book The Secret Life of Houdini that the key {{required}} to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was 6 inches long, and {{could not have been}} smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water. Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the custom design of the handcuffs) that the Mirror challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure showmanship.|$|E
