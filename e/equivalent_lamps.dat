25|$|Diamond {{color is}} graded by {{comparing}} a sample stone to a master stone set of diamonds. Each master stone {{is known to}} exhibit the very least amount of body color that a diamond in that color grade may exhibit. A trained diamond grader compares a diamond of unknown grade against the series of master stones, assessing where {{in the range of}} color the diamond resides. This process occurs in a lighting box, fitted with daylight <b>equivalent</b> <b>lamps.</b> Accurate color grading can only be performed with diamond unset, as the comparison with master stones is done with diamond placed on its table facet and pavilion side facing upwards. When color grading is done in the mounting, the grade is expressed as an estimated color grade and commonly as a range of color. Grading mounted diamonds involves holding the mounted diamonds table close to the table facet of the master stone and visually comparing the diamond color under the same color conditions as unmounted diamond grading. The resulting grade is typically less accurate, and is therefore expressed as a range of color. While a grading laboratory will possess a complete set of master stones representing every color grade, the independent grader working in a retail environment works with a smaller subset of master stones that covers only the typical grade range of color they expect to encounter while grading. A common subset of master stones would consist of five diamonds in two grade increments, such as an E, G, I, K, and M. The intermediate grades are assessed by the graders judgement.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps {{give off}} about one-fifth {{the heat of}} <b>equivalent</b> {{incandescent}} <b>lamps.</b> This greatly reduces the size, cost, and energy consumption devoted to air conditioning for office buildings that would typically have many lights and few windows.|$|R
25|$|Typically a {{fluorescent}} lamp will last 10 to 20 {{times as long}} as an <b>equivalent</b> incandescent <b>lamp</b> when operated several hours at a time. Under standard test conditions general lighting lamps have 9,000 hours or longer service life.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} of voltage-fed piezoelectric transformers (PTs) driving cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs). It is shown that the non-linear <b>equivalent</b> <b>lamp</b> resistance can have a dramatic impact on the overall system performance, causing possible instabilities both at large and small signal level. The effects of the variable load resistance, with a negative small-signal value, are enhanced by the PT, that behaves like a high-Q resonant circuit, and {{by the presence of}} the coupling inductor, usually placed between the half-bridge inverter and the PT to ensure zero-voltage commutation of the inverter switches. Such instabilities are investigated considering a constant frequency inverter where the lamp current is controlled by varying the dc-link voltage. SPICE simulations and analytical models are employed to explain the unstable behaviors observed in different experimental prototypes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the behavior of}} power supplies for cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFL) employing piezoelectric transformers (PTs). It has been demonstrated that the non-linear <b>equivalent</b> <b>lamp</b> resistance interacts with the PT that behaves like a high-Q resonant circuit, giving rise to instabilities in the audible frequency range [Spiazzi, G. et al. 2004]. Moreover, when the PTs are driven by a voltage-fed inverter and its DC supply voltage is used to control the lamp voltage, {{the relation between the}} control variable and the lamp current can become nonmonotonic, depending also on the coupling network used between the inverter and the PT. This paper extends the analysis reported in Spiazzi, G. et al. (2004) by considering different coupling networks as well as considering the inverter switching frequency as the control variable for controlling the lamp current. SPICE simulations and analytical models are employed to explain the unstable behaviors observed in different experimental prototypes...|$|R
2500|$|Britain did not adopt bright {{headlights}} as {{they would}} affect night vision and so could mask the low-intensity oil lamps used in the semaphore signals and {{at each end of}} trains, increasing the danger of missing signals, especially on busy tracks. Locomotive stopping distances were also normally much greater than the range of headlights, and the railways were well-signalled and fully fenced to prevent livestock and people from straying onto them, largely negating the need for bright lamps. Thus low-intensity oil lamps continued to be used, positioned on the front of locomotives to indicate the class of each train. Four [...] "lamp irons" [...] (brackets on which to place the lamps) were provided: one below the chimney and three evenly spaced {{across the top of the}} buffer beam. The exception to this was the Southern Railway and its constituents, who added an extra lamp iron each side of the smokebox, and the arrangement of lamps (or in daylight, white circular plates) told railway staff the origin and destination of the train. On all vehicles, <b>equivalent</b> <b>lamp</b> irons were also provided on the rear of the locomotive or tender for when the locomotive was running tender- or bunker-first.|$|R
2500|$|While the {{purchase}} price of a CFL is typically 3–10 times {{greater than that of}} an <b>equivalent</b> incandescent <b>lamp,</b> a CFL lasts 8–15 times longer and uses two-thirds to three-quarters less energy. A U.S. article stated [...] "A household that invested $90 in changing 30 fixtures to CFLs would save $440 to $1,500 over the five-year life of the bulbs, depending on your cost of electricity. Look at your utility bill and imagine a 12% discount to estimate the savings." ...|$|R
50|$|Compact {{fluorescent}} lamps (CFLs) use less power than an incandescent lamp {{to supply the}} same amount of light, however they contain mercury which is a disposal hazard. Due to the ability to reduce electricity consumption, many organizations encourage the adoption of CFLs. Some electric utilities and local governments have subsidized CFLs or provided them free to customers as a means of reducing electricity demand. For a given light output, CFLs use between one fifth and one quarter the power of an <b>equivalent</b> incandescent <b>lamp.</b> Unlike incandescent lamps CFLs need a little time to warm up and reach full brightness. Not all CFLs are suitable for dimming.|$|R
2500|$|Because {{of their}} higher efficacy, CFLs use between one-seventh and {{one-third of the}} power of <b>equivalent</b> {{incandescent}} <b>lamps.</b> Fifty to seventy percent of the world's total lighting market sales were incandescent in 2010. Replacing all inefficient lighting with CFLs would save [...] per year, 2.5% of the world's electricity consumption. In the US, it is estimated that replacing all the incandescents would save 80 TWh yearly. Since CFLs use much less energy than incandescent lamps (ILs), a phase-out of ILs would result in less carbon dioxide (...) being emitted into the atmosphere. Exchanging ILs for efficient CFLs on a global scale would achieve annual [...] reductions of 230 Mt (million tons), more than the combined yearly [...] emissions of the Netherlands and Portugal.|$|R
40|$|With the {{interest}} to reduce electrical energy consumption {{there is an}} upcoming shift from the traditional incandescent lamps to more energy efficient types of lighting. This has raised a concern of a possible adverse effect on the power grid as we replace a resistive load with an electronic one. The main concerns include harmonic distortion, losses in the grid, and displacement power factor (cos). A set of measurements {{have been made in}} order to determent how a shift in lamps would affect a number of power quality parameters. The measurements have been conducted on a typical household base load consisting of a mix of lamps, TV, computers, heat and kitchen equipment. The measurements have been performed in the laboratory so as to have complete control over the load. A typical consumption pattern has been defined however so as to make the measurements both realistic and reproducible. In the initial stage the installation contains only incandescent lamps; in the final stage all incandescent lamps are replaced with a more energy efficient alternative. A second set of measurements have been made in a medium size hotel, with a load of over 500 incandescent lamps. The power quality has been monitored before, during and after all the lamps were replaced by 40 W <b>equivalent</b> LED <b>lamps.</b> This paper will focus on harmonic distortion up to 9 kHz as well as the affect a shift in lamps will have on the displacement power factor and on losses in the distribution grid.
