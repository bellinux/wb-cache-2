[...] Goldwater's parents were married in an Episcopal church in Phoenix; for his entire life, Goldwater was an Episcopalian, though on rare occasions he referred to himself as [...] "Jewish". While he did not often attend church, he stated that [...] "If a man acts in a religious way, an ethical way, then he's really a religious man—and it doesn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with how often he gets inside a church".|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{songs that}} I sing don't {{fall into that}} category, so I don't think about it at all. But I believe that music does {{influence}} people. It's a universal thing. Everybody listens to music and knows about it. I think that the lyrics can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with influencing whoever you're singing to. I think {{that as far as}} children are concerned, parents should have control over what they listen to. If they don't want them to listen to records that are very sexual or explicit or outrageous, they should have control over that situation. As for adults, they're going to buy whatever kind of music they want to hear, so if they buy music with explicit lyrics, they must like it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Damage to {{different}} areas of the brain can have varied effects on memory. [...] The temporal lobes, {{on the sides of the}} brain, contain the hippocampus and amygdala, and therefore <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with memory transition and formation. [...] Patients who have had injury to this area have experienced problems creating new long-term memories. [...] For example, the most studied individual in the history of brain research, HM, retained his previously stored long-term memory as well as functional short-term memory, but was unable to remember anything after it was out of his short-term memory. [...] A patient whose fornix was damaged bilaterally suffered severe anterograde amnesia but no effect on any other forms of memory or cognition. [...] In the fictional case of a patient with a cherry-sized tumor pressing on the temporal lobe of his brain, he temporarily suffered total retrograde amnesia, even after surgery was performed to remove the tumor. [...] However, with time, he was not only able to remember everything starting after the surgery, but childhood memories, up to age 12, all returned with clarity.|$|E

2500|$|Dawkins expresses {{concern about}} {{increasing}} religious influence in British schools with over 7,000 faith schools already {{and the government}} encouraging more, so {{over half of the}} new City Academies are expected to be sponsored by religious organizations. He says that the most worrying development is a new wave of private Evangelical schools that have adopted [...] the American Baptist Accelerated Christian Education curriculum, and as an example calls on Phoenix Academy in London. Dawkins is shown around the school by head teacher Adrian Hawkes and remarks on how the teaching material appears to mention God or Jesus on almost every page; such as a reference to Noah's Ark in a science textbook. Hawkes responds by saying that the stories could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with science if you believe in them, and that the science he was taught at school is laughable today. As an example, he mentions that he was taught that the moon came from the Earth's ocean and was [...] "somehow flung out into space" [...] {{during the early years of}} the Earth's life. Dawkins says that it should have been presented as a strong current theory. Another lesson talks about AIDS as being the [...] "wages of sin", so Dawkins inquires whether this might not be mixing health education with moralistic preaching. Hawkes responds that without a law-giver, [...] "Why is rape wrong? Why is pedophilia wrong?" [...] and that if people believe they can get away with committing bad deeds then they will tend to do them. Dawkins responds to this claim by asking Hawkes if the only reason he doesn't do these things is that he's frightened of God and subsequently suggests that this attitude is characteristic of the warped morality that religion tends to instill in people.|$|E
