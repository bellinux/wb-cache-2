40|$|Purpose : It is {{well known}} that trace {{elements}} and heavy metals {{play a significant role in}} human health and disease. These elements play an important role in different metabolic pathways of cells and tissues. Trace element deficiency or excess is implicated in the development or progression of some cancers. We present a study which investigates serum/ plasma levels of trace-heavy elements in metastatic colon cancer patients and healthy subjects. Methods : Blood sam ples were collected from 29 healthy subjects and 40 patients with metastatic colon cancer in Oncology Department of Medical School of Yuzuncu Yil University. In both groups, the serum levels of copper (Cu), magnesium (Mg), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), zinc (Zn) selenium (Se), manganese (Mn), and cadmium (Cd) were determined. Results : Higher levels of Cu, Mg, Pb, Cr, Zn, Mn and Cd were seen in patients with metastatic colon cancer compared to healthy subjects and these findings were statistically significant (p 0. 05). Se levels were noted to be lower in patients with colon cancer in comparison to healthy subjects and this finding was also statistically significant (p 0. 05). Conclusions : According to our findings there was significant <b>diffence</b> in trace elements and heavy metals levels between healthy sub jects and metastatic colon cancer patients. Therefore heavy metal and trace elements may have prognostic significance in complex disorders including colon cancer.

40|$|Patients with {{cerebral}} achromatopsia, a perceptual disorder {{caused by}} ventromedial occipital brain damage, can be completely unable to arrange colours in chromatic sequence and fail most conventional tests of colour blindness. A {{possible explanation for}} cerebral achromatopsia is that the colour-opponent parvocellular (P) channel has been selectively and totally destroyed {{at the level of}} visual cortex, leaving vision to be mediated by the broad-band magnocellular (M) channel. The persistence of normal occipital visually evoked potentials, and preserved sensitivity to isoluminant chromatic gratings indicates that if this hypothesis is correct the destruction must occur beyond the striate cortex. We have shown that an achromatopsic subject can detect chromatic borders and construct shape from colour, and that he can even perceive the apparent direction of motion of a phase shifted isoluminant chromatic grating where perceived direction depends on knowing the sign of the colour <b>diffence,</b> i. e., which colour is which in the stripes. This and other evidence suggests that perhaps only one part of the cortical P channel has been destroyed. Does the critical area involved in achromatopsia correspond to cortical area V 4 of monkeys, often implicated in processing wavelength? When Visual Area 4 is totally ablated in monkeys they have only a mild colour discrimination impairment and easily solve the colour ordering and colour selection tasks that an achromatopsic patient finds impossible. However, monkeys with ventromedial damage rostral to Area V 4 do perform like achromatopsic patients, suggesting that the role of V 4 in the perception of colour is still unclear and that the colour area of the human brain does not correspond to area V 4...|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} are {{to validate}} the noninvasive parameters, QT interval, QT dispersion, Tpeak-Tend interval, and the activation recovery time (ART) for estimation of global {{dispersion of ventricular repolarization}} (DVR), and to investigate the changes of repolarization sequence and DVR by altered ventricular pacing sites. The material consisted of 12 patients (Study I) and two series healthy pigs with 10 in each (Studies II and III; Studies IV and V). In Study I, endocardial MAPs and unipolar electrograms were recorded using the CARTO system in 12 patients. End of repolarization (EOR) times from the MAPs and ARTs from the unipolar electrograms were acquired and 3 -dimensional maps of global EOR and ART were reconstructed. The ART sequence was consistent with that of EOR and no significant <b>diffence</b> was found between EOR times and ART. A significant, positive correlation between the ART and the EOR time was also found in all maps. These findings suggest the usefulness of the ART in evaluation of global sequence and dispersion of ventricular repolarization. In Studies II and III, MAP mapping was performed over both the ventricular endo- and the epicardium using the CARTO system in 10 open-chest pigs, from which the EOR times over the epi- (EORepi), endocardium (EORendo) and over both (EORtotal) were obtained- 12 -lead ECG were recorded simultaneously. The QTpeak intervals were significantly smaller than the maximal EORepi. No significant difference was found between the maximal QTend interval and the maximal EORendo, between the maximal QTend interval and the maximal EORtotal nor between the minimal QTpeak interval and the minimal EORtotal, which suggests that not only the transmural gradients, but also the apico-basal repolarization gradients contribute to the genesis of the T wave. In addition, the maximal Tpeak-Tend intervals were consistent with the dispersion of EOR-total, and significantly correlated with the dispersion of EOR-total. However, the mean Tpeak-Tend intervals, and Tpeak-Tend intervals from lead II and V 5 were all significantly smaller than and poorly correlated with the dispersion of EOR-total, as were the QTpeak and QTend dispersions. These findings suggest that the maximal Tpeak-Tend interval may be used as a noninvasive estimate of the global DVR, but not the QTpeak and QTend dispersions, nor the mean Tpeak-Tend interval and that from a single lead. In Studies IV and V, global MAPs were recorded from the ventricular endocardium during right atrial (RA), RV apex endocardial (RVEndo) and LV laterobasal epicardial (LVEpi) pacing in 10 pigs, with ECG simultaneously recorded. During RA pacing, the EOR sequence followed the AT sequence in both ventricles. Strikingly, the EOR sequence was also consistent with the AT sequence in both ventricles during RVEndo and LVEpi pacing, even though the mapping was performed after an abrupt change of the pacing site. In all maps, there was a negative correlation between the MAP duration and the AT and a positive correlation between the EOR time and the AT under each pacing protocol. These findings suggest the importance of activation sequence in governing repolarization patterns. Significant changes in repolarization from an altered activation sequence may happen within a few hours in vivo, implying that electrical remodeling of the ventricles may be rapidly induced by altered activation sequence. In addition, the global dispersion of EOR times during LVEpi pacing was significantly greater than those during RA and RVEndo pacing, whereas no significant difference was found between those during RA and RVEndo pacing. In addition, the QT intervals, QT dispersion and Tpeak-Tend intervals during LVEpi pacing were all significantly greater than those during RA and RVEndo pacing These findings provide in vivo evidence supporting the involvement of increased DVR in the incidence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias in a subgroup of patients with biventricular pacing...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 201520. yüzyılda sanayileşme ve ekonominin gelişmesine bağlı olarak kentleşme büyük bir hızla artış göstererek, büyük kentler meydana gelmeye başlamıştır. Kentleşmenin önlenemez artışı sonucu yaşanan arsa krizleri, küçük alanlarda çok katlı binaların yapılmasına ve otopark gibi alanların yeraltına taşınmasına neden olmuştur. Böylelikle günümüzde sıkça kullanılmakta olan derin kazıların yapılması konusu mühendislik çalışmaları açısından önemli bir noktaya gelmiştir. Bu çalışma, derin kazı destek sistemlerinden biri olan diyafram duvarlı iksa perdelerinde meydana gelen deplasmanlar ile sahada ölçülen deplasmanların karşılaştırılması ve değişen zemin parametrelerinin deplasmanlar üzerindeki etkilerinin incelenmesi amacıyla hazırlanmıştır. Yapılan çalışmada, öncelikle derin kazı destek yöntemleri ana hatları ile açıklanmıştır. Daha sonra diyafram duvarlı iksa perdelerinden detaylı biçimde bahsedilmiştir. Destekli kazıların gözlemlenmesi amacıyla kullanılan yöntemler ile ilgili genel bilgeler verilmiştir. Özellikle inklinometreler ile iksa sisteminde meydana gelen deplasmanların gözlemlenmesi üzerinde durulmuştur. Tez kapsamında, incelenen iksa projesi ile ilgili bilgiler (kazı planı, zemin profili ve kesitler) verilmiştir. Sonlu elemanlar yöntemi ve Plaxis programından genel olarak bahsedilmiştir. Ardından Plaxis analizlerinden elde edilen deplasmanlar gösterilmiştir. Sahada ölçülen deplasmanlar verilerek, hesaplanan deplasmanlar ile karşılaştırılmıştır. Belirlenen ve ölçülen deplasman değerlerinin kesitlerin çoğunda birbirine yakın olduğu, birkaç kesitte ise Plaxis analizlerinden elde edilen deplasmanların ölçülenlere oranla daha fazla olduğu gözlenmiştir. Çalışmanın son kısmında tasarım aşamasında belirlenen zemin parametrelerini (içsel sürtünme açısı, elastisite modülü ve kohezyon) belirli oranlarda arttırarak parametrik bir çalışma yapılmıştır. Arttırılan zemin parametrelerine göre yeniden yapılan analizlerde, farklı deplasmanlar elde edilmiştir. Buna göre, zemin parametrelerinin değişiminin deplasmanlar üzerindeki etkileri değerlendirilmiştir. Deplasmanlar dışında zemin parametrelerinin değişimi sonucunda diyafram duvarda meydana gelen moment ve kesme kuvvetleri de incelenmiştir. Bu değerler dizayn aşamasında elde edilen moment ve kesme kuvvetleri ile karşılaştırılmış ve meydana gelen değişim gözlenmiştir. Urbanization is a {{phenomenon}} {{dating back to the}} early stages of humanity. Depending on the development of industrialization and urbanization, the economy has improved, so that large cities have occurred. In {{the first quarter of the}} twentyfirst century, urbanization move ahead of industrialization in Turkey. Uncontrolled urbanization has brought, with it increasing population growth, the need for land; land values have increased dramatically in order to meet the demand with the supply. Land crisis was able to take a breath as a result of construction of multi-storey buildings in small areas and construction of under ground structures via deep excavations. Therefore deep excavation has become one of the focal points of the geotechnical engineering. In order to perform deep excavations, shoring system is needed. Today, deep excavation can be made with different shoring systems. Most preferred ones are mini piles, bored piles, secant piles and diaphragm walls. Mentioned systems are vertical supports and as bearing system they are cantilever and can also be supported by prestressed anchors or struts. Taking into account the soil profile in the excavation region, groundwater level, depth of the excavation, neighboring structures and environmental factors, most accurate shoring system should be preferred to be safe and economical. Otherwise, the stress increase in the ground and settlements in neighboring buildings due to long-term draining of groundwater may occur. To design safe and economical shoring system, selected parameters and assumptions made should be close to reality. In result of the excavation of the multi-storey buildings with multiple basement, very high stresses occur. In this case, the diaphragm walls are one of the most safe system that can be preferred. Diaphragm walls are more rigid compared to the pile system and also allows observation of displacements that occurs during excavation. These displacement can be determined with inclinometers. Shoring system should be kept under control by comparing horizontal and vertical displacements obtained by instrumental observations made with inclinometers and the displacements specified during project. This study has been prepared to compare displacements that were calculated in shoring system with diaphragm walls, a type of deep excavation support system, with the displacements measured in the field; and to investigate the effect of changing soil parameters on the displacements. In this study, deep excavation support methods are outlined first. Then the support system used in this thesis which is diaphragm walls are discussed in detail. xxii General information about the methods used to observe the excavations has been given. In particular, the information focuses on monitoring the displacements that occurs in shoring systems via inclinometers. An example of a shoring application is analyzed by a finite element software program namely Plaxis. At this stage, general information about the project is given. The soil profile, the excavation depth and sectional properties are presented. In the thesis, the finite element method and Plaxis program are explained briefly. Then displacements obtained from Plaxis analysis are shown in different sections. Then displacements measured in the field are compared with the calculated displacements. In most of the sections, measured and calculated displacements are close to each other, in several sections, displacement results from Plaxis analysis are greater compared to the displacements measured in field. In the last part of the study, a parametric study conducted by proportionally inreasing the soil parameters (internal friction angle, elasticity modulus and cohesion) determined in the design phase. Different displacements were obtained according to the analysis with increased soil parameters. The effect of changes on soil parameters on displacements were investigated. Besides displacements, moments and shear forces occurred in diaphragm wall as a result of change of soil parameters are also investigated. These values are compared with the moments and shear forces calculated at the design stage and changes in the results are observed. During design process, idealized soil profile and determined soil parameters (internal friction angle, elasticity modulus and cohesion) and evaluation of the results obtained with great care is one of the most important factors of modeling close to reality. Otherwise over designed projects can be done and they can be uneconomical. Also under designed projects may result with hazardous situation threatening life and property. According to the analysis carried out within this thesis, it is observed that the calculated displacements and measured displacement were close to each other. But in some sections (Section 1, Section 2 and Section 4) displacements calculated by Plaxis program seem to be slightly higher compared to the measured displacements. In order to see the impact of changes of soil parameters on diplacements, internal friction angle, modulus of elasticity and cohesion values increased by 5 % 15 % 25 % and new analysis for all sections were made. The results of the analysis can be summarised as follows; - Increasing the angle of internal friction in the fill has caused decrease in the calculated displacements. - Increasing the modulus of elasticity of the fill did not cause a significant difference in the calculated displacements. - Increasing the angle of internal friction in rock did not cause a significant difference in the calculated displacements. - Increasing the elasticity modulus of the rock has caused decrease in the calculated displacements. - Increasing the cohesion of the rock did not cause a significant difference in the calculated displacements. xxiii With respect to the analysis on sections, for fill, internal friction angle, for rock, the modulus of elasticity can be effective on displacements. On the other hand the displacements obtained from parameters specified in the design phase and the displacement measured in field are close values. In some sections, it seems that the displacements measured in the field are smaller. Accordingly, it is seen that the system is generally formed in an economical and safe way. In addition, the effect of changes in soil parameters on shear forces and moments were investigated. According to the analysis; - Increasing the angle of internal friction in the fill has led to a reduction in moment and shear forces in Section 1, Section 4 and Section 4 a. - Increasing the modulus of elasticity in the fill has cause a decrease in moment, but no change in shear forces in Section 2, Section 3 and Section 5. - Increasing the angle of internal friction in rock did not cause a significant difference in shear forces and moments. - Increasing the elasticity modulus of the rock does not lead to a noticeable difference in the shear forces and moments. - Increasing cohesion in rock did not cause a significant difference in shear forces and moments. Increase in the cohesion of rock did not cause a significant <b>diffence</b> in shear forces and moments. During execution of deep excavations, occurring displacements should be observed with instruments to provide safety and to be able to project against any potential risks. Any loss of life or property can be avoided by taking precautions for risk factors as result of observations. In conclusion, the selection of the correct soil parameters at design state is essentially important for design to be realistic, safe and economical. Because in civil engineering applications soil conditions are known to have significant effect on engineering designs and construction methods. In order to determine the correct soil parameters, detailed soil surveys should be made primarily. Then, obtained data should be analyzed correctly and should be interpreted accordingly. Selection of the correct soil parameters is one the most important factors in the design state. Otherwise, the design would be devoid of the reality. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} years several {{relaxation}} approximations to partial differential equations {{of various types}} have been proposed, from the classical kinetic schemes for gas dynamics to the relaxation schemes for conservation laws and Hamilton-Jacobi equations and the diffusive relaxation schemes for convection-diffusion problems. In the present paper we review some basic results on numerical methods derived from relaxation approximations of differential equations and present some recent developments and open problems related to their extension to second- and fourth-order degenerate diffusion equations. We present a class of numerical schemes for the approximation of second-order degenerate diffusion (or convection-diffusion) equations. The schemes {{are based on a}} suitable relaxation approximation that permits to reduce the second-order diffusion equations to first-order semilinear hyperbolic systems with stiff terms. In a similar way we show how fourth-order diffusion equations can be approximated by second- or first-order relaxation systems with stiff terms. The numerical passage from the relaxation system to the nonlinear diffusion equation is realized by suitable semi-implicit or fully implicit time discretizations combined with upwind and central <b>diffences</b> in space. Applications to porous-media equations and thin-film equations in one and two space dimensions are presented...|$|R
30|$|Denise had {{established}} a criteria—edible and non-edible shell creatures. This criterion was relational with her ways of knowing. The group discussed what Denise had shown and explained that children learn about edible and non-edible shells when they were very young—one to two {{years of age and}} during times when families walked along the foreshores of the island and when fishing or playing in the water. Sorting activities assist with the promotion of understandings of grouping and similarities and <b>diffences.</b> Children and adults sort objects into groups using objects from their daily life experiences. They learn to identify sameness that defines the characteristics of groupings (Sousa 2008). The idea of creating and naming groups continues throughout life and is a way of creating and organising information and making connections with peoples’ experiences. Before young children can learn to count groups, they begin the process of defining a collection using the objects in their daily lives (Baroody and Benson 2001; Sousa 2008). Hence, they need experiences that have a rich variety of two- and three-dimensional objects. Noticing likenesses and differences among objects, children become aware of the features of different objects. They also become aware of grouping objects. Such an understanding paves the way for learning about partitioning.|$|R

40|$|Abstract only availableGalls are novel plant organs, {{produced}} {{under the}} insect's direction. These ecotopic organs provide {{food and shelter}} for the developing larvae. The cell of many galls are richer in starch and sugars than normal tissues and the insect uses this rich food to grow in a protected place. In a previous study of galls on grape leaves, the lab found that plant genes specifying the vegetative-to-reproductive transition and fruit and seed identity were expressed in developing galls. To fully test the hypothesis that insects make plant galls by upregulating fruit genes, one needs to block expression of the genes and show that a gall can't be made. This is difficult to do in grape but {{can be done in}} poplar, so we are working with galls on poplar leaves. In poplar leaves with or without galls, sectioned and stained using Toluene Blue O dye and examined under polarized light at 20 magnification, we identified changes that galls make in leaf development. We detected a number of histological changes in galled leaves, including patterning of xylem & phloem, palisade and spongy parenchyma. We prepared RNA from fruit, ungalled leaf and galled leaf to study <b>diffences</b> in their expression of meristem identity and carpel genes. Although we didn't have time to do the gene expression work, we predict that the expression of fruit genes will be elevated in the gall tissue compared to surrounding normal leaf tissue.

40|$|Isolation, {{cultivation}} {{and identification}} of Spirogyra morphotypes are fundamentals for a continued study on its infra- and interspecific relationships. The monographs published by Czurda (1932), Kolkwitz and Krieger (1941), Transeau (1951), Randhawa (1959) or Kadlubowska (1984) are {{based solely on}} morphological diacritical features of field collected material. However, Allen (1958) {{was the first to}} observe polyploidy in clonal cultures and therefore introduced the term “species complex” for derived groups with euploidal <b>diffences</b> and distinct morphology leading to multiple “traditional” species. A “species complex” in Spirogyra consists of a series of morphotypes of different ploidy emanating from a clonal morphotype. Hoshaw et al. (1985, 1987) confirmed polyploidy in Spirogyra and McCourt and Hoshaw (1990) focused on problems associated with species concepts in this genus. Richard et al. (1990) confirmed that polyploidy {{plays a major role in}} morphological diversity of Spirogyra filaments. Recently, cytological study of Kim et al. (2009) underlined the aneuploidy phenomenon in the genus. Summing up, the uncertain position of Spirogyra within the Zygnemataceae and its complex species structure can be resolved only by detailed studies of clonal cultures including traditional characters, karyology (Kim et al. 2009) and molecular markers as provided in this study. Knowledge of nuclear cytology in algae remains to be much improved, compared to that in higher plants and animals. We supposed that additional species complexes will be delimited and that polyploidy is widespread among Spirogyra. Special attention was paid to the different karyological methods...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{published}} data define cachexia {{just as a}} loss of certain amount of body weight in a certain time frame. Recently new definition was published and aside from this major criterion it demands fulfillment of 3 out of 5 addiotional clinical or laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of cachexia. The principal {{aim of this study}} was to establish if this new definition influences the prevalence of cachexia. The study shows that significant number of patients that met major criterion did not fulfill 3 out of 5 additional criteria which led to a significant reduction in prevalence of cachexia. Given the uniformity of definition and a general lack of comparative studies between patients diagnosed with diseases related to cachexia patients were divided into three subgroups: patients with solid hematological tumors, patients with other solid tumors and patients with congestive heart failure. Differences in presentations of additional diagnostic criteria, given by the new definition and considered to be fundamental to cachexia, were analysed between these subgroups and significant differences were found. Together with differences observed in some typical anthropometric variables one can conclude that there are indeed significant <b>diffences</b> between cachectic patients that are related to the disease that is responsible for cachexia. Value of measuring urea excretion in 24 -hour urin sample was investigated as a method for evaluation of enhanced proteolysis which is believed to be critical in development of cachexia. Data from this study show that measuring urea excretion in 24 -hour urin sample is not an adequate method for such evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 148 - 151. This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} develop image based animation methods using {{the technique of}} optic flow analysis developed for a moving planar object. Image based rendering {{is presented as a}} class of algorithm using two dimensional shortcuts to the problem of three dimensional animation. The optic flow field is used to develop an image based algorithm based on its use as a description of the <b>diffences</b> between consecutive frames of an animation. A Taylor analysis of the optic flow field is the underlying tool used, breaking the field up into a hierarchy of terms. For a moving planar object, we have considerably simplified the second order Taylor terms into a basis of just two independent terms, which can be related closely to a perspective transformation between frames. Perspective transformations capture exactly the optic flow of a moving planar object. Using the simplified decomposition of the flow field for a moving plane, we decompose the frame to frame transformation into a hierarchy of terms of increasing accuracy and cost. Depending on their accuracy we may choose any of these as transformation on an image between frames, instead of rerendering. The errors in the approximation can be tracked via the Taylor series. This dissertation develops the theory and presents an animation algorithm based on optic flow, and then presents the results of various tests of the algorithm in a variety of simple scenes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and the time saving achieved in animation...|$|R
40|$|We {{postulated}} that {{the variability of}} the phase shift (PS) between blood pressure (BP) and heart rate fluctuation around the frequency of 0, 10 Hz may be a useful marker {{in the assessment of}} autonomic circulatory control in health and disease. We tested this hypothesis in four groups of subjects: 28 young healthy individuals, 13 old healthy individuals, 25 patients with coronary heart disease and 19 patients with a planned or implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Data from continuous 5 min. measurements during free breathing and at two different controlled breathing frequencies (BF) (0, 10 and 0, 33 Hz) were used. Variability of PS was analyzed in a graphical form and numerically. Clear differences in variability of PS were evident between the ICD recipients and all the other groups. Furthermore, at a BF of 0, 10 Hz differences in baroreflex sensitivity also became evident, even though these differences were not apparent at the 0, 33 Hz BF. 0, 10 Hz represents a useful and potentially important frequency for controlled breathing, at which differences in BP-RR interactions become evident. These interactions, whether computed as variability of phase to define stability of the BP-heart rate interaction, or as baroreflex sensitivity to define the gain of the heart rate response to BP changes, are significantly different in patients at risk for sudden arrhythmic death. In young versus older healthy individuals, only baroreflex gain is different, with variability of PS similar in both groups. The 0, 10 Hz BF may represent a natural resonating frequency of the baroreflex, at which <b>diffences</b> in measurements of stability and gain are most manifest. These measurements of short-term circulatory control may provide important information on baroreflex physiology and cardiovascular stability and may help in risk stratification for sudden cardiac death.

40|$|Background: Heating {{process with}} {{autoclave}} {{is one of}} limb salvage modalities that are widely used. but the results are not satisfying, due to mechanical bone fragility. However, considering this treatment modality is widely accepted in terms of financial, religion and sociocultural aspects, we conducted a on study rats treated with resection and reconstruction with autoclave heating method to assess bone healing by sequential radiology, histopathologic osteoblasts count, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). Methods: Thirty six Sprague-Dawley rats {{were divided into two}} groups with one group being the autoclave group and others served as control group. In both groups, the tibial diaphysis was extracted en bloc for 7 mm. All groups were kept for 8 weeks and treated under the same condition except the autoclave group, where the extracted bones were put into autoclave at 134 °C for 15 minutes and refixed again with k-wire. We performed radiological examination at 5 th and 8 th week using Lane and Sandhu radiological score. After extraction, the tibial bones were inspected for histological pattern using Salked modified score, osteoblast quantity counting and BMP- 2 values. Results: There were statistically significant <b>diffences</b> between control and autoclave group on radiological score at 5 th (5. 12 ± 1. 6 g vs 3. 21 ± 2. 42, p = 0. 023) and 8 th week (6. 06 ± 1. 71 vs 4. 29 ± 2. 53, p = 0. 040), histological score between groups (6. 06 ± 1. 14 vs 4. 14 ± 1. 99, p = 0. 005), osteoblast count (p < 0. 001), and BMP- 2 expression,  respectively. Conclusion: Autoclave recycling autograft lowered the speed of graft incorporation and BMP- 2 expression. Therefore, autoclave recycling autograft as a method of limb salvage surgery must be reevaluated and not considered to be applied for treatment in bone malignancy.   </p...|$|R
