5|$|Lincolnshire has two school districts: Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103 and Adlai E. Stevenson High School District 125, {{although}} a <b>few</b> <b>students</b> {{living in the}} village also attend school in Aptakisic-Tripp Community Consolidated School District 102 in neighboring Buffalo Grove. District103, which feeds into District 125, is home to three schools: Laura B. Sprague Elementary School (K-2), Half Day Intermediate School (3–4), and Daniel Wright Junior High School (5–8); District125 comprises only Adlai E. Stevenson High School. Both are public school districts, funded by the government.|$|E
5|$|The Academy at Saint Petersburg, {{established}} by Peter the Great, {{was intended to}} improve education in Russia and to close the scientific gap with Western Europe. As a result, it was made especially attractive to foreign scholars like Euler. The academy possessed ample financial resources and a comprehensive library drawn from the private libraries of Peter himself and of the nobility. Very <b>few</b> <b>students</b> {{were enrolled in the}} academy in order to lessen the faculty's teaching burden, and the academy emphasized research and offered to its faculty both the time and the freedom to pursue scientific questions.|$|E
5|$|After his discharge, Robinson briefly {{returned}} to his old football club, the Los Angeles Bulldogs. Robinson then accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor Rev. Karl Downs to be the athletic director at Sam Huston College in Austin, then of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. The job included coaching the school's basketball team for the 1944–45 season. As it was a fledgling program, <b>few</b> <b>students</b> tried out for the basketball team, and Robinson even resorted to inserting himself into the lineup for exhibition games. Although his teams were outmatched by opponents, Robinson was respected as a disciplinarian coach, and drew the admiration of, among others, Langston University basketball player Marques Haynes, a future member of the Harlem Globetrotters.|$|E

5|$|David Margoliouth (professor 1889–1937) {{taught the}} {{syllabus}} {{for the final}} examinations in lectures over two years, forcing some students to tackle the more difficult texts {{in their first year}} of study. Successive professors had <b>few</b> <b>students</b> until after the Second World War, when numbers increased because of the reputation of the then professor, Gibb, and because some British students became interested in Arabic culture while serving in the Middle East during the war. Julia Bray, the Laudian Professor , was appointed in 2012 and is the first woman to hold the position. She is a member of Oxford's Faculty of Oriental Studies, based at the Oriental Institute.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at Cambridge Vaughan Williams {{continued}} his weekly lessons with Parry, and studied composition with Charles Wood and organ with Alan Gray. He graduated as Bachelor of Music in 1894 and Bachelor of Arts the following year. After leaving the university he returned to complete his training at the RCM. Parry had by then succeeded Sir George Grove {{as director of the}} college, and Vaughan Williams's new professor of composition was Charles Villiers Stanford. Relations between teacher and student were stormy. Stanford, who had been adventurous in his younger days, had grown deeply conservative; he clashed vigorously with his modern-minded pupil. Vaughan Williams had no wish to follow in the traditions of Stanford's idols, Brahms and Wagner, and he stood up to his teacher as <b>few</b> <b>students</b> dared to do. Beneath Stanford's bluster lay a recognition of Vaughan Williams's talent and a desire to help the young man correct his opaque orchestration and extreme predilection for modal music.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Marcella Saunders, a 23-year-old {{teacher at}} Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, found that her ninth-grade {{students}} {{were unable to}} read the short stories and poetry in the class textbook. She thought that, because her students were more familiar with television than poetry or short stories, she would have more success in teaching her students if she taught them {{by way of a}} television series. She found that her students liked Bewitched, Room 222, and Julia, so she contacted the corresponding television studios to tell them about her idea. Only Bewitched responded. Having gained an audience with Montgomery and her husband William Asher, Saunders told the couple that most students at the school were unable to read, write, or comprehend at a high school level, with 44% reading at a third grade level and very <b>few</b> <b>students</b> reading at a level much higher than that; less than 1% were reading at a ninth grade level. Saunders added that Bewitched was the students' favorite television series.|$|E

40|$|Professor Ian Young, the Chair of the Group of Eight Universities, {{has argued}} that fee {{deregulation}} will {{have a positive effect}} on all universities. The Group of Eight universities will take the opportunity to “downsize”, to teach <b>fewer</b> <b>students</b> whilst increasing the amount spent upon each student. As they enrol <b>fewer</b> <b>students,</b> those who might otherwise have enrolled or aspired to a Group of Eight university will be available to “lower tier” institutions and we will have a system in which everybody wins...|$|R

25|$|Most {{of these}} women {{received}} little or no recognition during their lives due to their lower professional standing {{in the field of}} astronomy.

25|$|VSU proponents further {{argue that}} <b>few</b> <b>students</b> {{participate}} in such political action, meaning that only ideologues will suffer {{as they will}} not be able to use others' money for their own causes. VSU opponents argue that the range of students involved in any one particular activity may be small, but the number of students involved in some combination of activities – political or otherwise – was high, and must be lower under VSU.|$|E
25|$|The {{schools were}} highly {{rejected}} by the more conservative Tabrizis, specially clerics, alleging that Roshdieh {{is trying to make}} the students quit Islam, mentioning the school ring and its similarity to church bells. This resulted in mobs destroying some of his schools (which resulted in a <b>few</b> <b>students</b> being killed or injured), unsuccessful assassination attempts using guns, and later a fatwa against the modern schools, which finally resulted in him fleeing Tabriz.|$|E

25|$|Around 8p.m., another rally {{was held}} on the campus Commons.

At 11:00p.m., the Guard announced that a curfew had gone into effect and began forcing the students back to their dorms. A <b>few</b> <b>students</b> were bayoneted by Guardsmen.|$|E
25|$|In 1925 the {{government}} adopted {{a plan to}} expand secular education, but ten years later there were only 8,000 students enrolled in twenty public schools.

25|$|Although {{the number}} of {{subjects}} offered was large, choices were limited as each school could offer only a few subjects on the list for budget constraints, restrictions on combinations of subjects and the actual time allowed to cover the large syllabus of different subjects. In addition, some of the subjects were unpopular. One could not tAle the A and AS of a subject at the same examination. Students could take a maximum of 7 AL and/or AS subjects in one examination, but only a <b>few</b> <b>students</b> actually took 7 subjects from 2004.|$|E
