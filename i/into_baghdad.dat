5|$|An Alid revolt led by Muhammad ibn Qasim {{broke out}} in Khurasan in early 834, but was swiftly {{defeated}} and Muhammad brought as a prisoner to the Caliph's court. He managed to escape during the night of 8/9 October 834, {{taking advantage of the}} Eid al-Fitr festivities, and was never heard of again. In June/July of the same year, 'Ujayf ibn 'Anbasa was sent to subdue the Zutt. These were people brought from India by the Sassanid emperors and settled in the Mesopotamian Marshes. The Zutt had rebelled against caliphal authority since , and had been regularly raiding the environs of Basra and Wasit since that time. 'Ujayf was successful in encircling the Zutt and forcing them to surrender after a seven-month campaign, making a triumphal entry <b>into</b> <b>Baghdad</b> in January 835 with his numerous captives. Many of the Zutt were then sent to Ayn Zarba on the Byzantine frontier, where they fell fighting against the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|From late 2001, Hercules began {{flying into}} Afghanistan {{to support the}} SAS {{squadron}} deployed as part of Operation Slipper, Australia's contribution to the War in Afghanistan. Five Hercules of Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons joined relief efforts following the Bali Bombings in October 2002. In February 2003, a detachment of Hercules from No.36 Squadron was deployed to the Middle East {{as part of the}} Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq. These aircraft arrived on 10February, and began flying transport sorties twelve days later. The C-130s were the main form of transport used to move Australian personnel and equipment in the theatre before and after the outbreak of fighting on 19March. During the invasion the Hercules supported SAS operations in western Iraq, one being the first Coalition aircraft to land at Al Asad Airbase after it was secured by special forces personnel on 12April. The C-130s transported supplies and equipment to airstrips in southern Iraq to support the operations of US and British forces. As {{the first phase of the}} war wound down, Australian Hercules flew medical supplies <b>into</b> <b>Baghdad</b> shortly after the city was captured. A rotating detachment of three Hercules was subsequently maintained in the Middle East to support the ongoing Australian contribution to the War in Afghanistan, as well as the forces stationed in Iraq. The aircraft assigned to this detachment amassed a total of 20,000operational flying hours by March 2010. An American contractor travelling on an Australian C-130 in Iraq was killed on 27June 2004 when the aircraft was struck by gunfire shortly after it took off from Baghdad.|$|E
25|$|Iraqi Kurds {{played an}} {{important}} role in the Iraq War. Kurdish parties joined forces against the Iraqi government during the war in Spring 2003. Kurdish military forces, known as Peshmerga, {{played an important}} role in the overthrow of the Iraqi government; however, Kurds have been reluctant to send troops <b>into</b> <b>Baghdad</b> since then, preferring not to be dragged into the sectarian struggle that so dominates much of Iraq.|$|E

There are two bridges that cross the Euphrates at Fallujah.|$|R
25|$|Three {{weeks into}} the invasion, U.S.-led Coalition forces moved <b>into</b> <b>Baghdad.</b> Units of the Iraqi Special Republican Guard led the defence of the city. The rest of the {{defenders}} were a mixture of Republican Guard units, regular army units, Fedayeen Saddam, and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. Initial plans were for Coalition units to surround the city and gradually move in, forcing Iraqi armor and ground units to cluster into a central pocket in the city, and then attack with air and artillery forces.|$|E
25|$|As in Afghanistan, the Air National Guard contributed {{significant}} {{airlift capability}} to Operation Iraqi Freedom. Thirteen of ANG's 25 airlift units participated, including 72 of 124 Air Force C-130s. Among their missions, Air National Guard C-130 crews airlifted {{elements of the}} 82d Airborne Division and the 3d Marine Expeditionary Force. Those crews also flew {{one of the first}} day/night airlift missions into an Iraq air base and delivered the first humanitarian supplies <b>into</b> <b>Baghdad</b> International Airport. During Operation Iraqi Freedom's first six months, Air National Guard C-130 crews airlifted 22,000 tons of cargo, 47,000 passengers, and flew 8,600 sorties in 21,000 hours.|$|E
25|$|While {{the fight}} around Musayib was raging on 3 April, other {{elements}} of the US 3rd ID had captured Baghdad International Airport. Before pushing deeper <b>into</b> <b>Baghdad,</b> US commanders decided to mop up the remnants of the Republican Guard Medina Division which were still present south of Baghdad. The intention was to catch the Medina Division from behind, while they were engaging other units to their front. The 2nd Brigade of the 3rd ID under Col. David Perkins was dispatched to the southwest towards Objective Saints, the codename for the intersection between highways 1 and 8. The interchange was defended by dismounted infantry, and during the fight for Objective Saints one US soldier was wounded and an M1 Abrams tank was disabled by an RPG round (it was later repaired).|$|E

50|$|During the Suez Crisis of 1956, {{after the}} {{invasion}} of the Sinai Peninsula by Israeli troops, and the intervention of British and French troops, martial law was declared in Syria. Later Syrian and Iraqi troops were brought into Jordan to prevent a possible Israeli invasion.

50|$|Between 1AM and 2AM {{local time}} on 26 June/June 27, 1993, 23 Tomahawk cruise {{missiles}} were launched by two U.S. warships <b>into</b> downtown <b>Baghdad.</b> These hit a building which {{was believed to}} be the headquarters of the Iraqi Intelligence Service in the Al Mansur district of Baghdad. Iraq claimed that nine civilians were killed in the attack and three civilian houses destroyed. The missiles were fired from the destroyer USS Peterson in the Red Sea and the cruiser USS Chancellorsville in the Persian Gulf.|$|R
500|$|In May, the 13th MEU {{moved into}} Tharthar, a [...] {{area that was}} AQI's last Anbar refuge. Their goal was to cut off insurgent travel between Anbar and Salahuddin Provinces <b>into</b> <b>Baghdad</b> and to uncover weapons caches. Resistance was light and many insurgents fled. The insurgents laid over 400 mines to slow the Marines down. In one operation, Marines found 18 tons of {{homemade}} explosives and [...] of ammonium nitrate fertilizer. They uncovered several mass graves, containing a total of over 100 victims left behind by AQI. Tharthar was cleared by August. Operation Alljah {{was one of the}} last significant Anbar offensives.

500|$|A {{total of}} 147 U.S. {{military}} personnel died in combat, and another 236 {{died as a}} result of accidents or other causes. Iraq agreed to a formal truce on March 3, and a permanent cease-fire on April 6. There was subsequent debate about whether UN Coalition forces should have driven as far as Baghdad to oust Saddam Hussein from power. Bush agreed that the decision to end the ground war when they did was correct, but the debate persisted as Hussein remained in power and rebuilt his military forces. Arguably the most significant debate concerned whether U.S. and Coalition forces had left Iraq too soon. In an April 15, 1994 interview with C-SPAN, Cheney was asked if the U.S. and UN forces should have moved <b>into</b> <b>Baghdad.</b> Cheney replied that occupying and attempting to take over the country would have been a [...] "bad idea" [...] and would have led to a [...] "quagmire", explaining that: ...|$|E

The riots were severe - foreign {{consulates}} were attacked and many people were killed and wounded throughout the country. The riots were quelled only with the military intervention of the Arab Legion and imposition of a curfew. As a result of the riots, the Majali government fell and the introduction of Jordan into the pact was cancelled.|$|R

50|$|A {{major reason}} why {{conservative}} Arab regimes felt threatened by Nasser {{during his first}} years in power was because his popularity had been demonstrated - even before the Suez crisis - {{when he became a}} leading critic of the 1955 Baghdad Pact. The Baghdad Pact was initially an alliance between Iraq and Turkey, which Britain supported with the goal of strengthening its power within the Middle East. Nasser considered the Baghdad Pact {{to be part of a}} British effort to split the Arab countries into differing groups, and to divide the region by escalating tension between them. The British later attempted to bring Jordan <b>into</b> the <b>Baghdad</b> Pact in late 1955 after Nasser agreed to purchase arms from Czechoslovokia in the Soviet bloc. The British were determined to bring Jordan <b>into</b> the <b>Baghdad</b> Pact and to apply pressure to try and force Jordan to join. Nasser had opposed the Baghdad Pact, and his successful effort to prevent Jordan from joining the pact is an example of his pragmatic diplomatic strategy. Nasser’s pragmatism towards Jordan meant that he aimed to force the Jordan regime to decline to join the pact, but he did not himself attempt to overthrow the regime. This stance was rewarded with Jordanian support for Egypt during the Suez Crisis the following year in 1956.|$|R

2500|$|Powell's {{position}} on the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 has been less consistent.

He stated: [...] "I am not persuaded that another surge of troops <b>into</b> <b>Baghdad</b> for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence, this civil war, will work." [...] Following his endorsement of Barack Obama in October 2008, however, Powell praised General David Petraeus and U.S. troops, as well as the Iraqi government, concluding that [...] "it's starting to turn around." [...] By mid-2009, he had concluded a surge of U.S. forces in Iraq should have come sooner, perhaps in late 2003. Throughout this period, Powell consistently argued that Iraqi political progress was essential, not just military force.|$|E
