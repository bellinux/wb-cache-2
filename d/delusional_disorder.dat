5|$|Psychotic {{symptoms}} may {{be present}} in several other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, drug intoxication, and drug-induced psychosis. Delusions ("non-bizarre") are also present in <b>delusional</b> <b>disorder,</b> and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than {{could be explained by}} chance, although {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia. A few people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may last a long time. It can resemble schizophrenia and be misdiagnosed as such.|$|E

40|$|<b>Delusional</b> <b>disorders</b> {{within a}} criminological context are often overlooked, {{misunderstood}} or simply dismissed as behavioural characteristics {{that do not}} belong {{within the field of}} criminology. However, case studies show {{that there is a need}} to understand how <b>delusional</b> <b>disorders</b> could lead to the committing of crime. To address this need a historical overview of <b>delusional</b> <b>disorders</b> is presented. Thereafter, the five criteria and seven subtypes of <b>delusional</b> <b>disorders,</b> as defined by the APA/DSM-IV-TR (2000), are discussed to provide a better understanding of these disorders. Five of the seven subtypes are also contextualised within the South African legal framework. Although the APA/DSM-IV-TR (2000) offers a comprehensive definition of these disorders, the limitations of the definition are discussed as well as types of <b>delusional</b> <b>disorders</b> that are not included in the definition. The aim is to explain the importance of <b>delusional</b> <b>disorders</b> within the field of criminology in the context of the APA/DSM-IV-TR (2000). Actual case studies and elements of particular crimes are used to highlight the relationship between <b>delusional</b> <b>disorders</b> and crime. Furthermore, the challenge related to criminal liability and determining whether individuals can be held accountable for their deluded actions, is discussed. Recommendations on how to treat and prevent potentially dangerous individuals from committing crimes while acting under these delusions are also dealt with...|$|R

25|$|Explaining {{the causes}} of {{delusions}} continues to be challenging and several theories have been developed. One is the genetic or biological theory, which states that close relatives of people with <b>delusional</b> <b>disorder</b> {{are at increased risk}} of delusional traits. Another theory is the dysfunctional cognitive processing, which states that delusions may arise from distorted ways people have of explaining life to themselves. A third theory is called motivated or defensive delusions. This one states that some of those persons who are predisposed might suffer the onset of <b>delusional</b> <b>disorder</b> in those moments when coping with life and maintaining high self-esteem becomes a significant challenge. In this case, the person views others as the cause of their personal difficulties in order to preserve a positive self-view.|$|E
25|$|Higher {{levels of}} {{dopamine}} {{qualify as a}} symptom of disorders of brain function. That they are needed to sustain certain delusions was examined by a preliminary study on <b>delusional</b> <b>disorder</b> (a psychotic syndrome) instigated to clarify if schizophrenia had a dopamine psychosis. There were positive results - delusions of jealousy and persecution had different levels of dopamine metabolite HVA and homovanillyl alcohol (which may have been genetic). These can be only regarded as tentative results; the study called for future research with a larger population.|$|E

25|$|In June 2004, a Federal {{court ruled}} that Schiff was liable for over $2 million in taxes, {{penalties}} and interest for the years 1979 through 1985. In that case, Schiff's attorney had filed a brief claiming a diminished capacity defense, contending that Schiff {{had been diagnosed with}} a chronic, severe <b>delusional</b> <b>disorder</b> relating to his beliefs about the federal income tax system. That was characterized by some of his opponents as a claim that those beliefs were the product of a delusion or even insanity and that Schiff had willingly allowed his defense counsel to raise such an argument.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{existence}} of ORS is generally accepted, there is some controversy {{as to whether it}} is a distinct condition or merely a part or manifestation of other psychiatric conditions, mainly due to the overlapping similarities. Similarly, there is controversy with regards how the disorder should be classified. As ORS has obsessive and compulsive features, some consider it as a type of obsessive compulsive spectrum disorder, while others consider it an anxiety disorder due to the strong anxiety component. It is also suggested to be a type of body dysmorphic disorder or, as it involves a single delusional belief, some suggest that ORS is a monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis (hypochondriacal type of <b>delusional</b> <b>disorder,</b> see monothematic delusion).|$|E
25|$|Some {{distinguish}} delusional and non-delusional {{forms of}} ORS. In the delusional type, there is complete {{conviction that the}} odor is real. In the non-delusional type, the individual is capable of {{some insight into the}} condition, and can recognize that the odor might not be real, and that their level of concern is excessive. Others argue that reported cases of ORS present a spectrum of different levels of insight. Since sometimes the core belief of ORS is not of delusional intensity, it is argued that considering the condition as a form of <b>delusional</b> <b>disorder,</b> as seems to occur in the DSM, is inappropriate. In one review, in 57% of cases the beliefs were fixed, held with complete conviction, and the individual could not be reassured that the odor was non existent. In 43% of cases the individual held the beliefs with less than complete conviction, and was able to varying degrees to consider the possibility that the odor was not existent.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, <b>delusional</b> <b>disorders</b> {{have emerged}} as a focus of {{clinical}} research and treatment innovation. Despite these advances, clinicians are still relatively ill informed about this group of disorders. The present review tries to up-date on historical aspects, current nosology, epidemiology, validity of the concept and treatment strategies for the delu-sional disorders. Over the years the concept of <b>delusional</b> <b>disorders</b> has been changing and has still not crystallized fully. The variation in diagnostic criteria {{over the years has}} hampered research in this field. The available research is mostly retrospective, with control groups of schizophrenia, and focusing more on demographic variables than the illness, treat-ment and outcome variables. There is a need for prospective studies with a variety of control groups and focus on a wide array of parameters that can help to validate <b>delusional</b> <b>disorders</b> as an independent diagnostic entity (German J Psy-chiatry 2006; 9 : 62 - 73) ...|$|R
