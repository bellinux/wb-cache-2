For the planetary <b>gear</b> <b>set,</b> it is complicated to model the misalignment error of carrier as, when this error is present, the planets and the carrier are tilted and contacts between sun–planet and ring–planet along tooth width are skewed. In this paper, a new lumped parameter model is set up to quasi-statically and dynamic analyze the planetary <b>gear</b> <b>set</b> with the position-dependent line of action due to the misalignment of the carrier. In the analytical model, each potential line of contact on the gear mesh is discretized into finite independent time-varying stiffness.
