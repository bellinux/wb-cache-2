50|$|For {{buildings}} with a <b>forced-air</b> <b>furnace,</b> a humidifier may be installed into the furnace. They can also protect wooden objects, antiques and other furnishings {{which may be}} sensitive to damage from overly dry air. In colder months, they may provide modest energy savings, since as humidity increases, occupants may feel warm at a lower temperature.|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{on three}} gas and two {{electric}} furnaces {{have been made}} to examine the field performance of these furnaces and their interactions with their forced-air distribution systems. The distribution systems were retrofitted as part of this study and the impact of retrofitting on furnace performance is discussed. In addition to field measurements, this paper will discuss how <b>forced-air</b> <b>furnace</b> systems are treated in proposed ASHRAE Standard 152 P, and applies the resulting equations to the systems tested in the field. The distribution system calculations in Standard 152 P are compared to the current methods employed in the “Furnaces ” chapter of ASHRAE’s HVAC Systems and Equipment Handbook, showing how the distribution system efficiencies calculated using Standard 152 P can be incorporated into the handbook.

40|$|To {{understand}} how propane combustion affected the {{indoor air quality}} of a construction site, various industrial hygiene sampling techniques were {{used to measure the}} level of carbon monoxide (CO) present. The levels of CO produced by two different heating sources on two separate days were compared to the OSHA construction industry Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 50 ppm. The CO values collected for a natural-gasfired, <b>forced-air</b> <b>furnace</b> and a propane-fueled, direct-fired heater were well below the statutory time weighted average (TWA) of 50 ppm. CO presents a non-apparent hazard in residential construction. Because the toxic gas is odorless and colorless, it is imperative that instrumentation be used to assess its presence. Within this study, a CO sampling methodology successfully quantified a CO risk, and simultaneously vetted the usefulness of five types CO sampling technology. Of the five instruments used to measure CO, two returned easily discernable data that are 1 ll recommended for use by residential contractors. The values were collected during the 06 / 07 winter construction season in Minnesota in a single family home under construction. I...|$|E
40|$|The common {{techniques}} used {{to heat the}} soil, such as buried tubing heated with circulating hot water or buried electric heating cables, are a substantial and expensive modification of the typical greenhouse. Additional heating and control systems are required. Such methods {{are unlikely to be}} used by growers if there is only marginal benefit in terms of increased yield. Here, we describe a simpler method for heating soil that makes use of the forced hot air furnace that is used to heat the greenhouse air. The only modification to the greenhouse was burial of air ducts underneath raised beds of soil. Experiments were conducted in a greenhouse at Malerba's Farm in Norwich CT. The greenhouse area was 30 x 96 ft, covered with a double layer of 6 -mil polyethylene film supported by steel hoops at 4 -ft spacing. It was heated by a 90 kilowatt oil-fired, <b>forced-air</b> <b>furnace</b> located in the south-west corner of the house. The furnace was activated by a thermostat if the air in the greenhouse cooled below 61 F. Fans for horizontal air flow helped maintain a uniform air temperature throughout the greenhouse. The soil was heated by blowing air from the furnace through buried air ducts (Figure 1). First, two 96 -ft lengths of 4 -in diameter, black polyethylene, corrugated drainage tubing were buried 1 ft deep and 2 ft apart centered under th...|$|E
40|$|The Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) {{evaluated}} {{heating and}} cooling system options for existing family housing at Fort Irwin, California. The purpose of this work was to quantify the energy conservation potential of alternative system types and to identify the most cost-effective technology available. The conventional residential heating/cooling systems at Fort Irwin are separate propane <b>forced-air</b> <b>furnaces</b> and central air conditioners. The options examined included air- and ground-source heat pumps, a natural gas furnace with central air conditioning, and a natural-gas-fired heat pump. The most cost-effective technology applicable to Fort Irwin {{was found to be}} the high-efficiency ground-source heat pumps. If all conventional units were replaced immediately, the net energy savings would be 76, 660 MBtu (80. 9 TJ) per year and a reduction in electrical demand of approximately 15, 000 kW-month. The initial investment for implementing this technology would be approximately $ 7. 1 million, with a savings-to-investment ratio of 1. 74...|$|R
