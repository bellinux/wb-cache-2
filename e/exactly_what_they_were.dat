5|$|Walt Disney Imagineering (WDI) built animatronic WALL-E's {{to promote}} the picture, which made {{appearances}} at Disneyland Resort, the Franklin Institute, the Miami Science Museum, the Seattle Center, and the Tokyo International Film Festival. Due to safety concerns, the 318kg robots were always strictly controlled and WDI always needed to know <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> required to interact with. For this reason, they generally refused to have their puppets meet and greet children at the theme parks in case a WALL-E trod on a child's foot. Those who {{wanted to take a}} photograph with the character had to make do with a cardboard cutout.|$|E
5|$|Kasche had not {{received}} a reply to his telegram of 17 March, so he sent a further telegram to von Ribbentrop on 26 March. In it he advised that two Partisan representatives had arrived in Zagreb for negotiations, and named them using their aliases. He {{pointed out that the}} Partisan interest in an armistice had increased, and emphasised that he considered this a significant development. By this time, Đilas and Velebit had returned to Zagreb, where they reiterated that the Partisans wanted recognition as a regular belligerent, and emphasised the futility of continued fighting. They effectively asked to be left alone to fight the Chetniks. According to Pavlowitch, it is not clear which side posed the question of what the Partisans would do if the British were to land in Yugoslavia without Partisan authorisation, but Đilas and Velebit said they would fight them as well as the Germans. They stated that their propaganda had been slanted towards the Soviet Union because {{they did not want to}} communicate with London. Their determination to fight the British if they landed was because they believed that the British would try to thwart their objective of seizing power in Yugoslavia. They further stated that the Chetniks would not fight the British because such a landing was <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> waiting for.|$|E
25|$|The {{rationing}} {{system also}} applied to clothing: leather was reserved exclusively for German army boots, and vanished completely from the market. Leather shoes {{were replaced by}} shoes made of rubber or canvas (raffia) with wooden soles. A variety of ersatz or substitute products appeared, which were not <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> called: ersatz wine, coffee (made with chicory), tobacco and soap.|$|E

25|$|Newspaper columnists {{subsequently}} exchanged mixed {{views about}} The Jeremy Kyle Show. Fiona Phillips, {{writing in the}} Daily Mirror, accused Judge Berg of being out of touch and claimed those appearing on the programme knew <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> letting themselves in for. However, Carole Malone at sister publication the Sunday Mirror claimed Kyle was only interested in helping his own ego.|$|E
25|$|Mercati {{examining}} {{the surfaces of}} the ceraunia noted that the stones were of flint {{and that they had}} been chipped all over by another stone to achieve by percussion their current forms. The protrusion at the bottom he identified as the attachment point of a haft. Concluding that these objects were not ceraunia he compared collections to determine <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were.</b> Vatican collections included artifacts from the New World of exactly the shapes of the supposed ceraunia. The reports of the explorers had identified them to be implements and weapons or parts of them.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2006, shortly {{after the release of}} the first demo, Seppälä and Kuri began searching for a female vocalist with high {{technical}} skills to replace Goodman, feeling he wasn't right for the music. Around the time they placed an ad, they found another for soprano vocalist Heidi Parviainen, who had grown tired of her keyboard duties of Iconofear. After listening to her samples, they decided to set up a demo with her and the band. It turned out that she was <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> looking for, due to her ability to both sing and contribute lyrics, after writing the lyrics to Passing Bells. This completed the band's lineup, now under the name of Amberian Dawn, the result of a day of brainstorming. In spite of having Goodman leave his position as singer, there were no hard feelings between him and the band, and he has made minor appearances on all three Amberian Dawn albums since.|$|E

5000|$|The reinterpretation {{he proposes}} is this. “Following nature means {{following}} the facts. It means getting {{the facts about}} the physical and social world we inhabit, and the facts about our situation in it ... before we deliberate about normative matters. It means facing those facts - accepting them for <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> no more and no less - before we draw normative conclusions from them. It means doing ethics from the facts constructing normative propositions a posteriori. It means adjusting those normative propositions to fit changes in the facts, and accepting those adjustments for <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> no more and no less. And it means living within the facts - {{within the realm of}} actual rather than hypothetical norm.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Newspapers were censored {{from the}} start, with papers often {{carrying}} articles written by Germans who {{purported to be}} editors. Printing <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> given, the bad English used in [...] "German" [...] articles gave away the propaganda items. During those months when {{it was possible to}} listen to the BBC openly it was also clear who was telling the truth. A Jersey paper written in Jersey French caused problems for the Germans as they could not translate it and it ceased production.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{distinguishing}} {{characteristics of}} White {{as a teacher}} was his encouragement of women as photographers. White sought out and personally coached many aspiring female photographers, who found his openness {{to a variety of}} styles and techniques <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> looking for {{at a time when most}} men had highly autocratic views. Ralph Steiner recalled that [...] "he didn't press hard for absolute perfection, but always found something to praise, [...] won him the worship of a lot of ladies." [...] By 1915 there were roughly twice as many women as men at the school. This ratio did not change until the 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} date had shifted to winter 2000, {{similarities}} were noted between {{the film and}} DreamWorks Animation's The Road to El Dorado. Marc Lument, a visual development artist on El Dorado, claimed [...] "It really was a race, and Katzenberg wanted ours out before theirs." [...] Lument also added that, [...] "We didn't know <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing, but we had the impression {{it was going to}} be very similar. Whoever came out second would face the impression that they copied the other." [...] Fullmer and Dindal denied the similarities with the latter commenting [...] "This version [...] was well in the works when that movie came out," [...] and further added [...] "Early on, when our movie got to be very comic, all of us felt that you can't be making this farce about a specific group of people unless we are going to poke fun at ourselves. This didn't seem to be a proper choice about Incas or any group of people. It was more of a fable." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Gamemakers' control center, {{about which}} Katniss can only {{speculate}} in the novel, was also developed as a location, helping to remind the audience of the artificial nature of the arena. Ross commented, [...] "so much of the film happens in the woods that it's easy to forget this is a futuristic society, manipulating these events {{for the sake of}} an audience. The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room." [...] Ross and visual effects supervisor Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal dei ex machina Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that [...] "we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [...] that just appear {{at the end of the}} movie? We wanted to find a way to introduce them without having to explain specifically and <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> and the game room was a really great opportunity for us to be able to do that." ...|$|E
