5|$|Hypothyroidism, {{also called}} underactive thyroid or low thyroid, {{is a common}} {{disorder}} of the endocrine {{system in which the}} thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> which is called cretinism.|$|E
5|$|Franklin was {{a pioneer}} in the field of archaeometry, which applies modern {{materials}} analysis to archaeology. She worked for example, on the dating of prehistoric bronze, copper and ceramic artifacts. In the early 1960s Franklin was {{one of a number of}} scientists who participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> Tooth Survey, a project founded by Eric and Louise Reiss along with other scientists such as Barry Commoner, which investigated levels of strontium-90—a radioactive isotope in fallout from nuclear weapons testing—in children's teeth. This research contributed to the cessation of atmospheric weapons testing. Franklin published more than a hundred scientific papers and contributions to books on the structure and properties of metals and alloys as well as on the history and social effects of technology.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Todd jumps bail and {{arrives in}} Port Charles upon {{learning}} that Starr {{has been involved}} in a car accident that resulted in the deaths of Cole and Hope. Todd thinks local mobster Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) is responsible for the deaths and seeks revenge. The charges against him for Victor's murder are dropped, due to a claim of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following his years in captivity, but Starr faces attempted murder charges for trying to kill Sonny. A pregnant Téa, who has been sought out by Blair to represent Starr, gets the charges dropped. In June, Todd is with Téa during an intense rainstorm when she goes into labor and gives birth to an unresponsive baby boy. Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) is also giving birth to a baby boy in a motel room. After Todd, searching for help, comes upon Heather Webber (Robin Mattson) in a shack, and she tells Todd that Téa's baby has died, he comes across Sam's son. An elated Téa sees the child and believes he is hers. Todd allows Téa to believe the child is hers, after Heather talks him out of telling Téa the truth. Todd forms a close relationship with Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright), Sonny's former wife, in the wake of yet another rejection from Blair, who is set to marry Tomás. Todd's role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> switch is eventually revealed. To make amends for almost killing her son, Steven, Heather lies to the judge and prosecutors about Todd's role in switching the babies. He is then released.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} plasma from newborn babies (cord blood) and adults to inhibit iron-induced lipid peroxidation was compared. The {{caeruloplasmin}} and transferrin concentrations, and latent iron-binding capacity were lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> (p less than 0. 001). The plasma {{of many of}} <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> had no latent iron-binding capacity and contained non-protein-bound iron (measured by the bleomycin assay). <b>The</b> <b>in</b> vitro ability of plasma to inhibit iron-induced liposome peroxidation by either ferroxidase antioxidant activity (caeruloplasmin) or iron-binding antioxidant activity (transferrin) was measured. <b>The</b> antioxidant activity <b>in</b> both assays was decreased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> (p less than 0. 001).

25|$|During breastfeeding, {{approximately}} 0.25–0.5grams per day of secretory IgA antibodies pass to <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> via milk. This {{is one of}} {{the important}} features of colostrum.

25|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, and a dry mouth. Serious side effects can include liver {{problems}} and regular monitoring of liver function tests is therefore recommended. Other serious risks include pancreatitis {{and an increased}} suicide risk. It is known to cause serious abnormalities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> if taken during pregnancy. Because of this it is not typically recommended in {{women of childbearing age}} who have migraines.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include vomiting, constipation, itchiness, lightheadedness, and drowsiness. Serious side effects may include {{breathing}} difficulties and addiction. It is unclear if {{its use in}} pregnancy is safe. Care should be used during breastfeeding as it may result in opiate toxicity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> Its use as of 2016 is not recommended in children. Codeine works following being broken down by the liver into morphine. How quickly this occurs depends on a person's genetics.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include feeling tired, tremor, nausea, and constipation. As {{amiodarone}} can have serious side effects, it is mainly recommended only for significant ventricular arrhythmias. Serious side effects include lung toxicity such as interstitial pneumonitis, liver problems, heart arrhythmias, vision problems, thyroid problems, and death. If taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding {{it can cause}} problems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> It is a class III antiarrhythmic medication.

25|$|According to some authorities, {{increasing}} {{evidence suggests that}} early skin-to-skin contact (also called kangaroo care) between mother and baby stimulates breastfeeding behavior <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> Newborns who are immediately placed on their mother’s skin have a natural instinct to latch on to the breast and start nursing, typically within one hour of birth. Immediate skin-to-skin contact may provide a form of imprinting that makes subsequent feeding significantly easier. In addition to more successful breastfeeding and bonding, immediate skin-to-skin contact reduces crying and warms the baby.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} pyloric {{stenosis}} is unclear. Risk factors in babies include birth by cesarean section, preterm birth, bottle feeding, and being first born.

25|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, {{abdominal}} pain, and constipation. It {{should not be}} used in those with an already slow heart rate and most of those with heart failure.

Propranolol may cause harmful effects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> if taken during pregnancy. Its use during breastfeeding is probably safe, but the baby should be monitored for side effects.

It is used in {{the treatment}} of many conditions, including rheumatic problems, a number of skin diseases, severe allergies, asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, croup, brain swelling, and along with antibiotics in tuberculosis. In adrenocortical insufficiency, it should be used together with a medication that has greater mineralocorticoid effects such as fludrocortisone. In preterm labor, it may be used to improve outcomes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> It may be taken by mouth, as an injection into a muscle, or intravenously. The effects of dexamethasone are frequently seen within a day and last for about three days.|$|E
25|$|Most {{babies are}} born head first; however about 4% are born feet or buttock first, known as breech.

While making a cut {{to the opening of}} the vagina, known as an episiotomy is common, it is generally not needed. In 2012, about 23 million deliveries occurred by a surgical procedure known as Caesarean section. Caesarean sections may be recommended for twins, signs of distress <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> or breech position. This method of delivery can take longer to heal from.|$|E
