50|$|Nigrini advocates two {{approaches}} to continuous transactions monitoring {{in his book}} on forensic analytics. The first approach is called the parallel scan where descriptive statistics related to the transactions {{in the current period}} are compared to the descriptive statistics for the prior periods. Large differences signal that something has changed. Had Knight Capital used such a metric on August 1, 2012 they would have seen, {{in a matter of minutes}} that their trading system was out of control. Nigrini also advocates risk scoring as a continuous monitoring methodology. Here <b>forensic</b> <b>units</b> (e.g., bank account customers, franchisees, travel agents, coupon redemptions, and locations) are scored on various predictors. The scores for the predictors are averaged and each unit ends up with a single risk score. High scores suggest a high risk of the behavior of interest and low scores are associated with a low risk. Audit activity would be directed towards those <b>forensic</b> <b>units</b> with high scores. The risk scoring approach can be programmed.|$|E

40|$|D. Cur. Abstract: In South Africa, {{the number}} of mental health care users in mental health {{institutions}} increases on daily basis. Most mental health care users are young, {{and the reasons for}} their admission are aggression and violent behaviours. This is supported by the study by Poggenpoel (2008 : 1), which found that there is great anger in schools in South Africa. Loots and Louw (2012 : 1) assert that the historical and contemporary social environments of South Africa have particular relevancy to the increase in aggression and violence. Most of these individuals who display aggression and violent behaviours commit serious criminal offences, and some of them end up being admitted to psychiatric institutions in <b>forensic</b> <b>units,</b> for care, treatment and rehabilitation. In almost all psychiatric institutions in South Africa, <b>forensic</b> <b>units</b> are full and a lot of mental health care users are cared for in prisons due to this lack of space. The mental health care users in <b>forensic</b> <b>units</b> are seldom discharged, as most of their families seem unwilling to have them back in their homes, and they end up being long-term mental health care users. Efforts are taken to contact families of mental health care users in <b>forensic</b> <b>units,</b> but family members fail to turn up for various reasons. This state of affairs tends to frustrate mental health care users in <b>forensic</b> <b>units,</b> and as a result, they quite often display hostility towards nurses who are caring for them, and they do so when it is least expected. This current study is based on the researcher’s previous study on the “Psychiatric nurses’ experience of hostile behaviour by mental health care users in a forensic unit” (Tema, 2010 : 33 - 46). The findings of the study revealed that psychiatric nurses in a forensic unit were distressed, and they needed to be assisted to have control and manage hostility in the forensic unit in a constructive manner. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a model to facilitate the mental health of the psychiatric nurses in a forensic unit to manage hostility constructively [...] ...|$|E

Aim: To capture patient’s perspectives of personal change through use of a psycho-education programme. Design: A purposive sample of (n = 20) participants were selected from two secure <b>forensic</b> <b>units</b> during the final year of a Randomised Controlled Trial. Structured interviews were completed using Repertory Grid. Results: Significant differences were apparent in three areas: have confidence to engage in groups, (z = - 2. 203, N = 18, p <. 05); understand my own illness and how it affects me, (z = - 2. 203, N = 18, p <. 05) and feel normal, (z = - 1. 997, N = 18, p <. 05). Themes emerging from field notes focussed on participant’s desire to ‘feel normal’. Feeling normal being closely correlated with feeling valued, having hope, feeling confident, understanding your illness and realising others have the same problems. Conclusions: Patient’s perceptions highlighted importance of feeling normal as part of their recovery journey...|$|E

40|$|Mental {{health service}} {{delivery}} in the UK has {{been subject to}} renewed policy scrutiny over the past decade. Mirroring moves in other countries, the focus of care has shifted from large institutions to community based services. There have been many benefits and some problems with this shift, not least in regard to public perceptions of the dangerousness of individuals with mental health problems. Concerns about discrimination and the social exclusion {{of the mentally ill}} are receiving attention by both central government and the devolved assemblies. The rise of the service user advocacy movement is evidenced by the increasing attention given to service user views in policy, research, education, service development and evaluation. Despite the clear rhetoric of involvement these changes have occurred in the face of calls and subsequent government moves to increase levels of compulsion and treatment of the mentally ill who are deemed dangerous.

40|$|The {{growth of}} digital storage {{capacities}} and diversity devices {{has had a}} significant time impact on digital forensic laboratories in law enforcement. Backlogs have become commonplace and increasingly more time is spent in the acquisition and preparation steps of an investigation as opposed to detailed evidence analysis and reporting. There is generally little room for increasing digital investigation capacity in law enforcement digital <b>forensic</b> <b>units</b> and the allocated budgets for these units are often decreasing. In the context of developing an efficient investigation process, {{one of the key}} challenges amounts to how to achieve more with less. This paper proposes a workflow management automation framework for handling common digital forensic tools. The objective is to streamline the digital investigation workflow - enabling more efficient use of limited hardware and software. The proposed automation framework reduces the time digital forensic experts waste conducting time consuming, though necessary, tasks. The evidence processing time is decreased through server-side automation resulting in 24 / 7 evidence preparation. The proposed framework increases efficiency of use of forensic software and hardware, reduces the infrastructure costs and license fees, and simplifies the preparation steps for the digital investigator. The proposed approach is evaluated in a real-world scenario to evaluate its robustness and highlight its benefits...|$|E

40|$|Aims.   This {{paper is}} a report of a study that {{compared}} relevant attitudinal dimensions of Registered Nurses and nursing aides working within a Young Offenders’ Institute and two young people’s <b>forensic</b> <b>units</b> in the United Kingdom towards young people in their care who self-harm. Background.   Nurses caring for young people within secure environments may engage at some point with patients who harm themselves. These staff often experience strong negative emotional reactions {{which can lead to}} antipathy and alienation. Methods.   Forty seven Registered Nurses and 22 nursing aides completed the Self-Harm Antipathy Scale, which consists of 30 attitudinal self-report items. The data were collected between June 2008 and December 2008, and analysed using spss version 17. Results.   Results displayed that age per se, length of service with self-harming clients, and whether the participant was a Registered Nurse or nursing aide, and number of self-harming clients worked with did not influence the Self-Harm Antipathy Scale score or any of its component sub-scores. However, field of nursing the nurse was registered under, previous study of self-harm, year first registered and gender showed significant effects. Conclusions.   Given that responses reflect a degree of both empathy and apathy it seems {{that there is a need}} to promote greater therapeutic alliances and communication; for example, the use of positive regard to help reduce the incidence of labelling and the negative effects this has upon relationships. There is a significant need for nursing staff working with young people who self-harm to have access to relevant educational programmes.

40|$|Background: Depression is a {{worldwide}} problem but {{studies have shown}} that after patients with depressive symptoms are in remission, difficulties in social relationships may persist. There is a need for future research on the relationship between social function and depressive symptoms in order to facilitate development of new clinical interventions. Objectives: This study aimed to identify what factors contribute to the relationship between depressive symptoms and social relationships and what factors predict improvement in depressive symptoms during psychiatric hospitalization. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study was based on a secondary analysis of RAI-MH data from the Ontario Mental Health Reporting System (OMHRS). Depressive symptoms were measured with the Depressive Symptoms Rating Scale (DRS) and social relationships difficulties were evaluated with the interRAI Social Relationships CAP. The sample comprised of 125, 120 patients from acute, long stay, addiction, psychiatric crisis units and <b>forensic</b> <b>units.</b> Sub-sample of patients with depressive symptoms and mood disorder was created (N = 38, 823). Results presented in a descriptive analysis for both samples and bivariate and multivariate analysis for the sub-sample. Logistic regression analysis was performed to predict rates of improvement of depressive symptoms. Results: The study revealed that many factors predict outcome of depressive symptoms. Difficulties in social relationships, older age, multi-morbidity, functional impairments, trauma, and poor physical health predict decreased odds of improvements but longer hospital stay, individual therapy and family/couples therapy predict increased odds of improvements. Conclusions: The interRAI Social Relationships CAP provides a valuable tool to address social issues in patient care, assist clinical staff in care planning and provide mental health authorities information for policy making...|$|E
40|$|Low secure {{forensic}} services {{have been identified}} as a common interface between inpatient care and care in the community. However, to date, no research has specifically explored the lived experience of discharge from such units. The present study aimed to address this by using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) to explore experience and sense making around community adjustment up to a year after discharge from two low secure <b>forensic</b> <b>units</b> in West Yorkshire. Theories of change, transition and identity, which were identified as potentially relevant to understanding the adjustment experience were incorporated into a semi-structured interview schedule, which was used to interview six people about their experiences. Three key findings emerged from the study. First, adjustment was characterised by both change and continuity. While to some extent participants were able to disengage from an inpatient role granted on the units, which was characterised by a loss of autonomy and identity, in other ways they remained changed by their experiences and struggled to move on towards a preferred identity or towards valued life goals following discharge. Secondly, ambivalence existed between participants seeing adjustment as a personal journey whilst simultaneously feeling internal and external pressure to strive for ‘normalcy. ’ Finally, in addition to presenting an adjustment challenge, discharge for many represented the first opportunity to work towards recovery, heightening the magnitude of the discharge experience. These findings have been discussed in relation to pertinent theories of identity and change. On the basis of the findings, recommendations have been made, including maximising retention of autonomy and valued aspects of service users’ identities during inpatient care and ensuring service users are at the centre of discharge planning to facilitate the adjustment process. In the context of these findings, further directions for clinical practice are discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
