At the local level, components of this service include: identifying populations that face barriers to accessing health services and addressing their personal health needs, assuring the linkage of these populations to appropriate health services by coordinating provider services, and developing and implementing interventions that address the barriers they face in attempting to access care. At the state and <b>governance</b> <b>levels,</b> components of this service include: assessing access to and availability of state health services; partnering with public, private, and non-profit sectors to provide a coordinated system of health care; assuring access to this coordinated health care system by using outreach efforts that link individuals to the health services they need; developing and implementing a continuous improvement process to assure the equitable distribution of resources for those in greatest need of these services.

40|$|Many {{issues in}} the water, energy and {{agricultural}} sector are in fact crosscutting issues, {{which can only be}} solved by a nexus approach. A nexus approach means that management solutions account for synergies and tradeoffs between the sectors. Critical issues emerging across the three sectors ask for different policies at different <b>governance</b> <b>levels.</b> However, at each level of policy making the impact at local level should be an important point of reference. In line with this, the case of the Aral Sea Basin in Central Asia exemplifies how international energy politics affect local farmers’ access to irrigation water. Moreover, a comparative study of three states in India shows that local differences in the implementation of the nexus approach can lead to different outcomes in terms of groundwater and electricity use for agriculture. These two examples underline that to implement a nexus approach; the local perspective should not be overlooked, even when policies are designed at higher <b>governance</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|E
40|$|The CDM has {{promoted}} GHG reduction activities in developing countries. There is, however, a controversial issue of an unequal distribution of CDM benefits among developing nations. To date, some emerging economies have been receiving {{the majority of}} CERs while most LDCs have few of them. This paper, hence, attempts to empirically identify determinants {{of the amount of}} CERs in order to suggest potential approaches for LDCs. Consequently, this paper finds that GHG reduction potentials, <b>governance</b> <b>levels,</b> and science and technical levels have significant positive effects on the amount of CERs. In contrast, looking at host countries in LDCs, ODA is the only factor having significant positive effects. This seems to show that CDM activities in LDCs have been implemented against the principle of market mechanism. Ultimately, this paper suggests that, LDCs ought to ameliorate their endogenous factors (i. e., <b>governance</b> <b>levels</b> and science and technical levels), and that international organization and advanced nations should further encourage LDCs by providing finance and capacity development programs. ...|$|E

Using a sample of 100 family-controlled listed companies, this dissertation explores large shareholder expropriation behavior in China's family-controlled firms. According to the empirical results, {{we have found that}} aggregate measure of large shareholder expropriation is significantly negatively corrected the overall corporate <b>governance</b> <b>level,</b> which means that companies with good corporate <b>governance</b> <b>level</b> tend to have less expropriation of minority shareholders. We also found that that aggregate measure of large shareholder expropriation is significantly negatively correlated with POA, suggesting that as large shareholders' expropriation activities, their holding companies' performance obviously decline.

Guidance is provided to those seeking to employ modeling techniques in an R&D enterprise for the purposes of understanding enterprise governance. Further, an example is modeled and explored for potential insight.

40|$|When firms {{compete in}} the {{managerial}} labor market, the choice of corporate governance by a firm affects (and is affected by) the choice of governance by other firms. Firms with weaker governance give higher payoffs to their management to incentivize them. This behavior forces firms with good governance to pay their management more than they would otherwise. This externality reduces the value to firms of investing in corporate governance and produces weaker overall governance in the economy. The effect is stronger the greater the competition for managers and the stronger the managerial bargaining power in setting their compensation. While regulatory standards can help raise governance towards efficient levels; market-based mechanisms such as (i) the acquisition of large equity stakes by raiders, and (ii) the need to raise external capital by firms can also improve <b>governance</b> <b>levels</b> {{not just in the}} firms that are directly affected by these mechanisms, but also in the competing firms. We characterize conditions under which such improvement is feasible and also when market mechanism may not suffice to improve <b>governance</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|E
40|$|We analyze {{simultaneously}} the {{determinants of}} governance, debt, and activist institutional ownership as a system of three equations. We find that governance relates positively to activist institutional ownership, but has no relation with leverage. Leverage is negatively related to governance and activist institutional ownership, and activist institutional ownership relates positively to governance but negatively to leverage. These results suggest that managers of firms with higher <b>governance</b> <b>levels</b> choose lower levels of debt. Furthermore, although managers have discretion over capital structure, they seem to consider <b>governance</b> <b>levels</b> as predetermined. Leverage and activist institutional ownership appear to be substitute devices. Activist institutions positively influence governance, but invest in firms with strong governance, possibly because stronger governance allows them to be “activists. ” Finally, we also find that larger firms and firms subject to greater public scrutiny {{have higher levels of}} governance, which highlights the importance of the firm’s environment in shaping corporate governance. Our analysis provides insights into how governance, leverage, and activist institutional ownership jointly form a system that monitors the firm...|$|E
40|$|An {{institution}} typically comprises constitutive rules, {{which give}} shape and meaning to social interactions and regulative rules, which prescribe agent behaviour in the society. Regulative rules guide social interaction, in particular {{when they are}} coupled with reward and punishment regulations that are enforced for (non-) compliance. Institution examples include legislation and contracts. Formal institutional reasoning frameworks automate ascribing social meaning to agent interaction and determining whether those actions have social meanings that comprise (non-) compliant behaviour. Yet, institutions do not just govern societies. Rather, in what is called multi-level governance, institutional designs at lower <b>governance</b> <b>levels</b> (e. g., national legislation at the national level) are governed by higher level institutions (e. g., directives, human rights charters and supranational agreements). When an institution design {{is found to be}} non-compliant, punishments can be issued by annulling the legislation or imposing fines on the responsible designers (i. e., government). In order to enforce multi-level governance, higher <b>governance</b> <b>levels</b> (e. g., courts applying human rights) must check lower level institution designs (e. g., national legislation) for compliance; in order to avoid punishment, lower <b>governance</b> <b>levels</b> (e. g., national governments) must check their institution designs are compliant with higher-level institutions before enactment. However, checking non-compliance of institution designs in multi-level governance is non-trivial. In particular, because institutions in multi-level governance operate at different levels of abstraction. Lower level institutions govern with concrete regulations whilst higher level institutions typically comprise increasingly vague and abstract regulations. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a formal framework with a novel semantics that defines compliance between concrete lower level institutions and abstract higher level institutions. The formal framework is complemented by a sound and complete computational framework that automates compliance checking, which we apply to a real-world case study...|$|E
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{a business}} concept that delivers technology “as a service”. Its lower cost of operation is the main economic driver for consumers and enterprises. The major obstruction to its adoption is security and governance risks inherent in its transnational nature.

The responsibility and authority of both the entities differs in each layer bifurcating influence of due care and due diligence. The existing internationally recognized security standards International Organization for Standardization (ISO 27001 / 2), Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) etc do not handle cloud computing domains from every aspect. Similarly, due to transnational nature of PCC, legislative acts of one country cannot get dejure recognition in different jurisdiction. These variations incapacitate PCC from achieving assurance and <b>governance</b> <b>level</b> to sustain cloud security.

40|$|There {{are many}} factors {{as to why}} Pasifika {{learners}} are not achieving alongside {{the rest of their}} social groups. Some factors may relate to socioeconomics, poverty, barriers to learning, and a school environment not conducive to Pasifika ways of being. School boards govern schools and one of their objectives is to provide quality education for all students. How is quality education being measured by the community? By different ethnic groups? Do school boards have a good representation of their community to ensure that students are attending school and receiving quality learning and support? The Ministry of Education (MoE) has targeted Maori and Pasifika as priority learners because of their lack of achievement compared to other groups. School boards are responsible for a strategic plan to ensure that their Maori and Pasifika learners are receiving quality education. It will be the Maori and Pasifika board members that have valuable insight into these cultures which can provide the beliefs and values that will create a learning environment ensuring a quality education for these students. Since the MoE have identified these priority learners they have the responsibility to ensure that schools have support systems in place to ensure that equitable teaching and learning opportunities are available for Maori and Pasifika learners. An important document that the MoE has published since 2001 to promote support systems for Pasifika learners is the Pasifika Education Plan and the main emphasis is the collaborative approach between the learner, family, community and the school towards bridging the gap between learners’ identity and culture and the school environment to foster positive learning outcomes. Another objective at <b>governance</b> <b>level</b> is support for the increase of Pasifika representation at <b>governance</b> <b>level</b> so therefore, a school with a high population of Pasifika students must have this same population reflected in the board representation of the school. A qualitative study with a culturally responsive conceptual framework and methodology was used when interviews were conducted with six Samoan board members in high schools with a large number of Pasifika students in South Auckland. Exploration of their perspectives pertaining to their role as board members {{and the use of the}} Pasifika Education Plan to inform their practice at <b>governance</b> <b>level</b> emerged during the interviews. The findings of this study centred around issues such as role satisfaction, recruitment of a wider representation of Pasifika, support for new board members, capability and capacity of members, cultural responsive leadership and maintaining culture, language, and identity of students in the schools. Samoan board members found their experiences in the role rewarding and they supported the need for a wider representation of Pasifika at <b>governance</b> <b>level</b> in order to inform the practice and policies to be more inclusive of the Pasifika learners to ensure that opportunities are available to support positive learning outcomes. Surprisingly, the Pasifika Education Plan was absent and not used to inform strategic plans and policy of the six schools. The exuberant passion and vision from these six Samoan board members was so energetic and powerful, it was evident that Pasifika learners’ needs are being discussed and debated at <b>governance</b> <b>level</b> in these schools so that they are more likely to receive the quality education they deserve...|$|R

The association between PFCG and PID ratings, measured by the rank correlation coefficient, is significant for the years 2004 and 2005 with the indication of stronger association for 2005 than for 2004. This may mean that rating criteria and the assessment methods for the two ratings are converging. It can also be confirmed that PID ratings are more stable and more rigid in assessing the corporate <b>governance</b> <b>level</b> in Polish listed companies. Results of the attempt {{to find out the}} relationship between the financial performance of companies and their ratings are mixed and disappointing. The representative ordered logit models for explaining the rating level of companies in terms of financial indicator variables have been estimated, with reasonable interpretation and, as expected, poor ex post forecast accuracy.
