5|$|Chelsea and Stuttgart faced <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{first time}} in European football. The English side were {{appearing}} in their second Cup Winners' Cup final, having won the tournament in 1971, while Stuttgart made their debut. Chelsea had met German clubs once, in the 1965–66 season of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup against 1860 Munich – Chelsea advanced to the next round after managing a 2–2 stalemate at the Grünwalder Stadion, and a 1–0 home win.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 2011–12 season, Salo {{suffered}} a minor groin injury that sidelined him on two separate occasions, costing him three games and one game, respectively. In January 2012, the Canucks and Bruins played against <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time since the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals. During the contest, Salo sustained a concussion after a clipping hit from opposing forward Brad Marchand. Salo left the game immediately, while Marchand received a five-minute major and game misconduct; he was later additionally suspended for five games following a hearing with the league.|$|E
5|$|On 23 August, dos Santos {{complained that}} the U.S. and South African governments {{continued}} to fund UNITA, warning such activity endangered the already fragile ceasefire. The next day Savimbi announced UNITA would no longer abide by the ceasefire, citing Kaunda's insistence that Savimbi leave the country and UNITA disband. The MPLA government responded to Savimbi's statement by moving troops from Cuito Cuanavale, under MPLA control, to UNITA-occupied Mavinga. The ceasefire broke down with dos Santos and the U.S. government blaming <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> resumption in armed conflict.|$|E

Although Alabama was a 40-point favorite as they entered the game, the Rams played the Crimson Tide close through the fourth quarter when a pair of late touchdowns gave Alabama a 31–6 victory. After both teams traded punts on their opening pair of possessions, Alabama took a 7–0 lead on a three-yard Kenyan Drake touchdown run.|$|E
5|$|On the July 27 {{edition of}} SmackDown!, Khali had his Championship Celebration which was {{interrupted}} by Batista. After Khali fled from the ring, Batista {{announced that he had}} challenged Khali to a match for the World Heavyweight Championship match. At SummerSlam, the two faced <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> World Heavyweight Championship in a match which Batista won by disqualification after Khali hit him with a chair. Since a championship cannot change hands via countout or disqualification, Khali retained the title.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats' success {{continued}} down the ballot. Meehan {{did not run}} for re-election, and the race for county sheriff pitted two incumbent city councilmen against <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> job: Democrat William M. Lennox and Republican Cornelius S. Deegan, Jr. The office of sheriff was another holdover county office. The sheriff, whose job differed {{from that of the}} chief of police, was the chief law enforcement officer of the court. Lennox came out ahead, and would hold the job for the next twenty years.|$|E

The Doctor and Idris work together to construct a makeshift TARDIS from scraps, and then pursue House.|$|E
5|$|The {{format for}} the Stanley Cup Final changed in 1922, with the {{creation}} of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). Three leagues competed for the Cup: two league champions faced <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> right to challenge the third champion in the final series. This lasted three seasons as the PCHA and the WCHL later merged to form the Western Hockey League (WHL) in 1925. After winning in the 1924–25 season, the Victoria Cougars became the last team outside the NHL to win the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry with}} Liverpool {{is rooted in}} {{competition}} between the cities during the Industrial Revolution when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while Liverpool was a major port. Manchester United and Liverpool are also the two most successful teams in England and, at many points in their history, they have battled <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> league title (most recently in the 2008–09 season). Their matches are usually considered by the players and their fans as the biggest in any given season.|$|E

Opposing players Renaldo Balkman and Linas Kleiza began arguing with each other after Balkman was called for a hard foul on Kleiza, but the {{incident}} was defused after Balkman was given a technical foul. Iverson, Anthony, and Marcus Camby were all removed early in the fourth quarter. Balkman and Kleiza later became teammates after Balkman was traded to the Nuggets in the 2008 off-season.|$|E
5|$|Three spacewalks were {{conducted}} by the crew of STS-97, {{all of which were}} completed prior to opening the hatch between shuttle and station. On 8 December, the hatch between the two was opened and the two crews greeted <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time. It had remained closed to maintain their respective atmospheric pressures. The Expedition 1 crew took this opportunity to leave the station and tour the inside of the space shuttle, which was thought to be good for their psychological well-being.|$|E
5|$|Capella A {{consists}} of two yellow evolved stars that have been calculated to orbit each other every 104 days with a separation of around 100 million km. The pair is a non-eclipsing binary—that is, as seen from Earth, neither star passes {{in front of the}} other. The orbit is known extremely accurately and can be used to derive an orbital parallax with far better precision than the one measured directly. The stars are not near enough to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Roche lobe of either star to have been filled and any significant mass transfer to have taken place, even during the red giant stage of the primary star.|$|E

5|$|Chris Sabin and Alex Shelley {{went back}} to {{competing}} in the tag team division as The Motor City Machine Guns before both transitioned into the X Division, challenging <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> vacant X Division Championship at TNA's Genesis PPV event on January11, 2009. However, they also continued as a tag team, with the two winning the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship on January4, 2009 by defeating No Limit (Tetsuya Naito and Yujiro) at New Japan Pro Wrestling's (NJPW) Wrestle Kingdom III in Tokyo Dome event. They then defended the NJPW championship in TNA against No Limit on the April 9, 2009 episode of Impact! successfully. The team defended it a second time in TNA, this time in a Three Way Six Sides of Steel Cage match with No Limit and The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide) at TNA's Lockdown PPV event on April19, 2009; they retained the championship at the show.|$|E
5|$|Fought at the {{junction}} of the east-west and north-south roads {{on the eastern side}} of the Black Forest, the day-long battle at Stockach and Engen pitted the two armies against <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second time in seven days. The Austrians still had the numerical superiority, but this time it was closer to two-to-one, instead of almost three-to-one. Jourdan had consolidated his force over a shorter line, and had the full Army of the Danube under his direct command. Charles, likewise, had shortened his line; although Hotze had not yet caught up with the archduke, he and his 10,000men were approaching from the Austrians' left rear.|$|E
5|$|Galatasaray and Arsenal met <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{first time}} in a European {{football}} competition, though the Turkish outfit had faced English clubs formerly on eight occasions. Their first was against Manchester United, in the 1993–94 Champions League second round, which they won 3–3 on away goals in a two-legged match. Both teams were reunited in the following season of the group stage, which concluded in a goalless tie and a Galatasaray blow. Other meetings include against West Bromwich Albion in the commencing round of the 1978–79 UEFA Cup, and Chelsea in this year's Champions League campaign. Arsenal by contrast ran into Turkish opposition twice, both of them against Fenerbahçe in the 1979–80 European Cup Winners' Cup first round; the home game was won by the English side 2–0, while the away leg ended in a 0–0 draw.|$|E

This was also the season that future Hall of Famer Clint Benedict became the Senators' top goaltender, taking over from Percy LeSueur. Former Wanderer Art Ross joined the Senators and helped Ottawa win in a two-game playoff, 4–1. The Senators then played in the first inter-league Stanley Cup final playoff series with the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast (PCHA) league. Cyclone Taylor, now of the Millionaires, haunted his old team, scoring six goals in three games as Ottawa lost three {{straight}} in Vancouver. Future Senator centreman Frank Nighbor played in this series for Vancouver and scored five goals.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the Yankees and Red Sox faced <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{first time}} in the ALCS. The Yankees were the {{defending}} World Series champions {{and in the midst of}} a run of three consecutive World Championships, while Boston had not appeared in the ALCS since 1990. The Yankees won the first game of the ALCS against the Red Sox on a 10th-inning walk-off home run by Bernie Williams off Boston reliever Rod Beck. The game was the first actual postseason meeting between the rivals because the one-game playoff in 1978 technically counted as a regular season game. Intensity built up due to this historic, first-ever postseason meeting between the two longtime rivals. The Yankees would win the first two games at home with 7th-inning comebacks.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the rain-affected practice and qualifying sessions, the track was dry {{for the duration of}} the race. All of the drivers except Jenson Button, Jarno Trulli and the two Red Bull drivers started on the softer option tyre. The first lap was eventful: Alonso started better than polesitter Massa and was able to take the inside line into turn one and gain the lead. Hamilton passed Räikkönen for third into the first corner, then drove round the outside of Massa into turn two to take second place. Meanwhile, the suspension on Adrian Sutil's Spyker failed at turn four, causing it to collide with Button's Honda and retire from the race. Button continued after making an early pitstop to repair the damage. Liuzzi and Sato also collided at turn four, causing Liuzzi to pit for a new front wing. After the race the drivers blamed <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> incident.|$|E
