Each unit is sponsored by a community organization as part of their youth program and is involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>and</b> community.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, another Hull House ghost story began circulating. According to this legend, after a man {{claimed that}} he would rather have the Devil in his house than a picture of The Virgin Mary, his child was born with pointed ears, horns, scale-covered skin, and a tail. The mother {{was said to have}} taken the baby to Hull House, where Addams was said to have {{attempted}} to have it baptized and wound up locking it in the attic. While initially annoyed about the story, which had no basis in fact, Addams became fascinated by the effect the episode had on old women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>and</b> used the episode as a basis for her book, The Long Road of Woman's Memory.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war David Sister and his family was evacuated to the left bank of the Volga River where he was appointed chief physician at the district hospital and a consultant of the nearby military hospital. The hospital was located in the open steppe between two villages and on the other side of Volga there was Stalingrad. The family lived there a few years. There were no other children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>and</b> Yulia had no friends to play with. But she was fascinated by the local nature and made observations of plants and animals. The inhabitants of the hospital could hear the cannonade from the other bank, and during the battle of Stalingrad it became particularly strong.|$|E

25|$|The Union-Miles Community Coalition {{had taken}} on an {{increasing}} number of tasks since its formation. Initially, it pressed the city to provide improved basic services, and to tear down abandoned, decrepit, or vandalized housing. It formed neighborhood watch programs and safety patrols, and it pushed local banks to establish branches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>and</b> provide more lending in the area. To enable it to take on increasingly complex problems requiring full-time staff and public and private financing, the coalition formed the nonprofit Union Miles Development Corporation (UMDC) on May 1, 1981. Working with the Center for Neighborhood Development, UMDC won passage of a new state law allowing nonprofit community development corporations to act as receivers for abandoned housing. UMDC also established the Cleveland Housing Receivership Project, which acted as a clearinghouse and advisory body to member neighborhood housing groups interested in using receivership to improve their Cleveland neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|Paul Wilson, {{chair of}} the Department of Criminology at Bond University, headed a pro bono team of lawyers making appeals on Stafford's behalf. Graeme Crowley, a private {{investigator}} and former police officer, led {{an investigation into the}} murder. Investigation revealed a possible sighting of Holland alive the day after Stafford said that he last saw her, other unsolved murders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> <b>and</b> two potential suspects not interviewed by police, one of them a mentally ill resident of a nearby caravan park who was found guilty of murdering another girl, Julie-Ann Lowe, a few weeks after Holland's killing. The DNA expert who had testified at the trial, Angela van Daal, also provided a statement that she believed the blood evidence inadequate for a conviction. With Wilson, Crowley published Who Killed Leanne? in 2005, and the investigation was featured on the ABC network series Australian Story in August 2007.|$|E
25|$|Her major investigative works include La noche de Tlatelolco (Massacre in Mexico) (1971), Fuerte es el silencio (Strong is Silence) (1975) and Nada nadie. Las voces del temblor (Nothing No one: The Voices of the Earthquake) (1988). The {{best known}} of these is La noche de Tlatelolco about the 1968 {{repression}} of student protests in Mexico City. She {{found out about the}} massacre on the evening of October 2, 1968, when her son was only four months old. Afterwards, Poniatowska went out on the streets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>and</b> began interviewing people while there was still blood on the streets and shoes strewn about and women searching for the children who had not come home. The books contains interviews with informants, eyewitnesses, former prisoners which are interspersed with poems by Octavio Paz and Rosario Castellanos, excepts from pre Hispanic texts and newspaper as well as political slogans. Massacre in Mexico was the only book published on the subject for twenty years, contradicting the government's account of the events and the number dead. The government offered her the Xavier Villaurrutia Award in 1970 for the work but she refused it.|$|E

Hauge suggested that Swartzwelder, who is an avid Western fan, would be the appropriate writer for the episode.

500|$|In 1966, the District of Columbia, the National Capital Planning Commission, and the Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA; a joint city-federal agency {{overseeing}} redevelopment in the city) {{announced the}} establishment of the Shaw Urban Renewal Area. [...] The 1968 riots caused only minor damage to the building, but the market did not reopen afterward. The closure of the market and many other nearby businesses caused a widespread decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> <b>and</b> left local residents without easy access to retail establishments. [...] In 1972, the Council of the District of Columbia approved a $30.4 million ($ million in [...] dollars) plan which, in part, provided for the purchase the O Street Market and its demolition. A modern shopping mall was planned for the site. The RLA purchased the property from the NLMC. Although neighborhood residents wanted the market torn down, the RLA declined to order its destruction. In 1974, the RLA proposed renovating the O Street Market and making it the retail centerpiece of a revived Shaw neighborhood. The agency awarded a $338,974 ($ in [...] dollars) contract in June 1974 to the firm of James Cox & Sons to renovate the structure.|$|E

500|$|Vick {{was born}} in Newport News, Virginia as the second of four {{children}} to Brenda Vick and Michael Boddie, then unmarried teenagers. His mother worked two jobs, obtained public financial assistance and had help from her parents, while his father worked long hours in the shipyards as a sandblaster and spray-painter. They were married when Michael was about five years old, but the children elected to continue to use their [...] "Vick" [...] surname. The family lived in the Ridley Circle Homes, a public housing project in a financially depressed and crime-ridden neighborhood located in the East End section of the port city. Local residents interviewed in a 2007 newspaper article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted that [...] "not much changed" [...] nearly a decade after Vick left. One resident {{said that there was}} drug dealing, drive-by shootings, and other killings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> <b>and</b> suggested that sports were a way out and a dream for many.

500|$|The Haymarket statue was vandalized {{with black}} paint on May 4, 1968, the 82nd {{anniversary of the}} Haymarket affair, {{following}} a confrontation between police and demonstrators at a protest against the Vietnam War. On October 6, 1969, shortly before the [...] "Days of Rage" [...] protests, the statue was destroyed when a bomb was placed between its legs. Weatherman took credit for the blast, which broke nearly 100 windows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>and</b> scattered pieces of the statue onto the Kennedy Expressway below. The statue was rebuilt and unveiled on May 4, 1970, to be blown up yet again by Weatherman on October 6, 1970. The statue was rebuilt, again, and Mayor Richard J. Daley posted a 24‑hour police guard at the statue. This guard cost $67,440 per year. In 1972, it {{was moved to the}} lobby of the Central Police Headquarters, and in 1976 to the enclosed courtyard of the Chicago police academy. For another three decades the statue's empty, graffiti-marked pedestal stood on its platform in the run-down remains of Haymarket Square where it was known as an anarchist landmark. On June 1, 2007, the statue was rededicated at Chicago Police Headquarters with a new pedestal, unveiled by Geraldine Doceka, Officer Mathias Degan's great-granddaughter.|$|E
500|$|Despite his popularity, {{the artist}} earned very little from his musical career. This {{was in part}} due to weak {{enforcement}} of copyright laws in Madagascar, which enabled the profits from illegally copied albums to go directly to pirates. Throughout his career as a professional musician he lived in the poor neighborhood of Anatihazo-Isotry in Antananarivo with 30members of his family. There he produced instruments and provided lessons in sodina performance. In the later years of his life, Rakoto Frah had over 80students at any given time. He was also a respected source of counsel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>and</b> was frequently visited by community members seeking his wisdom and advice. When based in Madagascar, the artist regularly accepted paid offers to perform on the sodina at traditional events such as famadihana (the Malagasy highland [...] "turning of the bones" [...] funerary tradition), circumcision ceremonies, weddings, engagement ceremonies, and traditional festivals held to celebrate the first rice harvest of the year. These events could last up to seven days, including performances throughout the night, and often required several days of travel to arrive at the site. Rakoto Frah was an avid fan of rugby, and he and his ensemble would regularly perform flute and drum music at national team matches. His final international festival performance was the Festival de Langon held in France in August 2001.|$|E
