25|$|According to the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks, {{the risk}} of <b>hearing</b> <b>damage</b> from digital audio players depends on both sound level and {{listening}} time. The listening habits of most users are unlikely to cause hearing loss, but some people are putting their hearing at risk, because they set the volume control very high or listen to music at high levels for many hours per day. Such listening habits may result in temporary or permanent hearing loss, tinnitus, and difficulties understanding speech in noisy environments.|$|E
25|$|The risk of <b>hearing</b> <b>damage</b> {{also depends}} on the {{exposure}} time. The higher the volume, the faster hearing loss occurs. According to OSHA work safety guidelines, workers should be exposed to 90dBA noise for a maximum of 8 hours to avoid hearing loss. An increase to just 95dBA cuts the safe exposure to only 4 hours. But {{there seems to be}} no specific consensus on the level of exposure. NIOSH has an 8-hour recommended exposure limit set to 85dBA. Additionally, an increase to 93dBA instead of 95dBA halves the safe exposure time to 4 hours.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a theory}} that vinyl records can audibly {{represent}} higher frequencies than compact discs. According to Red Book specifications, the compact disc has a frequency response of 20Hz up to 22,050Hz, and most CD players measure flat within {{a fraction of a}} decibel from at least 20Hz to 20kHz at full output. Turntable rumble obscures the low-end limit of vinyl but the upper end can be, with some cartridges, reasonably flat within a few decibels to 30kHz, with gentle roll-off. Carrier signals of Quad LPs popular in the 1970s were at 30kHz {{to be out of the}} range of human hearing. The average human auditory system is sensitive to frequencies from 20Hz to a maximum of around 20,000Hz. The upper and lower frequency limits of human hearing vary per person. High frequency sensitivity decreases as a person ages, a process called presbycusis. By contrast, <b>hearing</b> <b>damage</b> from loud noise exposure typically makes it more difficult to hear lower frequencies, such as three kHz through six kHz.|$|E

40|$|A modern {{hearing aid}} should be aesthetically {{appealing}} {{as well as}} offer sufficient and adequate signal amplification. Due to the small physical size of these devices, acoustical feedback (howling) is a major problem. Apart from the annoyance and potential <b>hearing</b> <b>damaging</b> effects that howling implies, it also reduces the supplied maximum Real Ear Aided Gain (REAG). This paper proposes a novel method for subband feedback detection and cancellation, based on the zero-crossing rate measure. After splitting the hearing aid input signal into subbands, the distances between subband zero-crossings are measured. A low distance variance in a particular subband indicates that howling has arisen. The variance measure is then used to adaptively and continuously steer subband gain functions which attenuate tonal infested subbands. The method {{has proven to be}} robust and simulation indicates that it offers additional REAG of about 15 dB...|$|R

500|$|The {{advantage}} of tactile transducers used for low frequencies {{is that they}} allow a listening environment that is not filled with loud low frequency waves. This helps the drummer in a rock music band to monitor his or her kick drum performance without filling the stage with powerful, loud low frequency sound from a 15" [...] (40cm) subwoofer monitor and an amplifier, which can [...] "leak" [...] into other drum mics and lower {{the quality of the}} sound mix. By not having a large, powerful subwoofer monitor, a bass shaker also enables a drummer to lower the sound pressure levels that they are exposed to during a performance, reducing the risk of <b>hearing</b> <b>damage.</b> For home cinema or video game use, bass shakers help the user avoid disturbing others in nearby apartments or rooms, because even powerful sound effects such as explosion sounds in a war video game or the simulated rumbling of an earthquake in an adventure film will not be heard by others. However, some critics argue that the felt vibrations are disconnected from the auditory experience, and they claim that that music is less satisfying with the [...] "butt shaker" [...] than sound effects. As well, critics have claimed that the bass shaker itself can rattle during loud sound effects, which can distract the listener.|$|E

2500|$|Pairing high {{sensitivity}} headphones {{with power}} amplifiers can produce dangerously high volumes and damage headphones. [...] The maximum {{sound pressure level}} {{is a matter of}} preference, with some sources recommending no higher than 110 to 120dB. [...] In contrast, the American Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends an average SPL of no more than 85dB(A) to avoid long-term hearing loss, while the European Union standard EN 50332-1:2013 recommends that volumes above 85dB(A) include a warning, with an absolute maximum volume (defined using 40–4000Hz noise) of no more than 100dB to avoid accidental <b>hearing</b> <b>damage.</b> [...] Using this standard, headphones with sensitivities of 90, 100 and 110dB (SPL)/V should be driven by an amplifier capable of no more than 3.162, 1.0 and 0.3162 RMS volts at maximum volume setting, respectively {{to reduce the risk of}} <b>hearing</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Using monitor {{speakers}} {{instead of}} in ear monitors typically results in an increase of stage volume, {{which can lead to}} more feedback issues and progressive <b>hearing</b> <b>damage</b> for the performers in front of them.

[...] The use of monitor loudspeakers, active (with an integrated amplifier) or passive, requires more cabling and gear on stage, resulting in an even more cluttered stage. [...] These factors, amongst others, have led to the increasing popularity of in-ear monitors.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{long-term}} {{risk factor}} from firefighting is exposure {{to high levels}} of sound, which can cause noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus. [...] NIHL is caused by exposure to sound levels at or above 85dBA according to NIOSH and at or above 90dBA according to OSHA. dBA represents A-weighted decibels. dBA is used for measuring sound levels relating to occupational sound exposure since it attempts to mimic the sensitivity of the human ear to different frequencies of sound. OSHA uses a 5-dBA exchange rate, which means that for every 5dBA increase in sound from 90dBA, the acceptable exposure time before a risk of permanent hearing loss occurs decreases by half (starting with 8 hours acceptable exposure time at 90dBA). NIOSH uses a 3-dBA exchange rate starting at 8 hours acceptable exposure time at 85dBA. [...] The time of exposure required to potentially cause damage depends on the level of sound exposed to..The most common causes of excessive sound exposure are sirens, transportation to and from fires, fire alarms, and work tools. Traveling in an emergency vehicle has shown to expose a person to between 103 and 114dBA of sound. According to OSHA, exposure at this level is acceptable for between 17 and 78 minutes and according to NIOSH is acceptable for between 35 seconds and 7.5 minutes [...] over a 24-hour day before permanent hearing loss can occur. This time period considers that no other high level sound exposure occurs in that 24-hour time frame. Sirens often output about 120dBA, which according to OSHA, 7.5 minutes of exposure is needed and according to NIOSH, 9 seconds of exposure is neededin a 24-hour time period before permanent hearing loss can occur. In addition to high sound levels, another risk factor for hearing disorders is the co-exposure to chemicals that are ototoxic. [...] The average day of work for a firefighter can often be under the sound exposure limit for both OSHA and NIOSH. The average day of sound exposure as a firefighter is often under the limit, but firefighters can be exposed to impulse noise, which has a very low acceptable time exposure before permanent <b>hearing</b> <b>damage</b> can occur due to the high intensity and short duration.|$|E

50|$|Loud sounds {{have long}} been known to cause damage to ears. In Norway, this fact was proved for coppersmiths {{as far back as}} 1731.Also {{acoustic}} instruments may represent a risk for <b>hearing</b> <b>damages,</b> especially with lengthy exercising in rooms with high reverberation. However, the sound level and the risk have increased with more powerful amplifiers and loudspeakers, and the volume at some concerts is far above the level which may induce such damages without ear protection. 115 dBA (Decibel-A) at average may be risky even after 30 seconds, and a 3 dB increase means doubling the sound level (an angle grinder at 1 m gives about 100 dBA, and in UK, Norway etc., it is strictly prohibited for workers to use it {{more than a few minutes}} without ear protection). The sound level claimed at some of Manowar's performances, may cause ear damages almost immediately; the phrase deafening sound should be taken literally. The Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005 introduced safety limits for daily noise exposure in the UK like 92 dBA as average during 30 minutes.|$|R
