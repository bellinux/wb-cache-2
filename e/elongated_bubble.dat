As a result of gravity, there is usually a thicker film of liquid {{on the bottom of the}} pipe as opposed to the top of the pipe.

Liquid holdup in this regime can be large but the gas velocities are low. [...] Stratified wave flow is similar to stratified smooth flow, but with a higher gas velocity. The higher gas velocity produces waves on the liquid surface. These waves may become large enough to break off liquid droplet at the peaks of the waves and become entrained in the gas. These droplets are distributed further down the pipe. [...] Slug flow is where large frothy waves of liquid form a slug that can fill the pipe completely.

40|$|Condensation {{of steam}} {{in a single}} microchannel, silicon test section was {{investigated}} visually at low flow rates. The microchannel was rectangular in cross-section with a depth of 30 pm, a width of 800 mu m and a length of 5. 0 mm, covered with a Pyrex glass to allow for visualization of the bubble formation process. By varying the cooling rate during condensation of the saturated water vapor, {{it was possible to}} control the shape, size and frequency of the bubbles formed. At low cooling rates using only natural air convection from the ambient environment, the flow pattern in the microchannel consisted of a nearly stable <b>elongated</b> <b>bubble</b> attached upstream (near the inlet) that pinched off into a train of elliptical bubbles downstream of the <b>elongated</b> <b>bubble.</b> It was observed that these elliptical bubbles were emitted periodically from the tip of the <b>elongated</b> <b>bubble</b> at a high frequency, with smaller size than the channel width. The shape of the emitted bubbles underwent modifications shortly after their generation until finally becoming a stable vertical ellipse, maintaining its shape and size as it flowed downstream at a constant speed. These periodically emitted elliptical bubbles thus formed an ordered bubble sequence (train). At higher cooling rates using chilled water in a copper heat sink attached to the test section, the bubble formation frequency increased significantly while the bubble size decreased, all the while forming a perfect bubble train flowing downstream of the microchannel. The emitted bubbles in this case immediately formed into a circular shape without any further modification after their separation from the <b>elongated</b> <b>bubble</b> upstream. The present study suggests that a method for controlling the size and generation frequency of microbubbles could be so developed, which may be of interest for microfluidic applications.
