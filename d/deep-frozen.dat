25|$|In late 2008 {{and early}} 2009 Knox-Johnston {{took part in}} a BBC {{programme}} called Top Dogs: Adventures in War, Sea and Ice. The programme saw him unite with fellow British legends Sir Ranulph Fiennes, the adventurer, and John Simpson, the BBC world affairs editor. The team went on three trips, each experiencing each other's adventure field. The first episode, aired on 27 March 2009, saw Knox-Johnston, Fiennes and Simpson go on a potentially very dangerous news-gathering trip to Afghanistan. The team reported from the legendary Khyber Pass and infamous Tora Bora mountain complex. The three also undertook a voyage around Cape Horn and an expedition hauling sledges across the <b>deep-frozen</b> Frobisher Bay in the far north of Canada.|$|E

40|$|The {{levels of}} soluble sugars, starch, pectin and {{insoluble}} fibre in blanched green beans, {{green beans and}} Padrón peppers were monitored during 12 months' <b>deep-freezing.</b> Blanching did not alter the pectin content of the beans, but reduced their soluble sugar and starch contents by 10 and 8 %, respectively. Nonetheless, levels of all these components of both vegetables were stable during <b>deep-freezing.</b> Blanching increased the insoluble fibre (IF) content of green beans by 45 %, thereby favouring hardening of the bean tissue and negatively affecting its organoleptic properties. <b>Deep-freezing</b> for periods longer than one month, especially in combination with vaccum packing, also increased the IF content of blanched beans, and likewise those of unblanched beans and Padrón peppers...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of various experimental {{conditions on the}} elastic modulus and hardness of human intertubular dentin was studied using instrumented nanoindentation at room temperature. The conditions studied were: dry (chemically dehydrated) versus wet (prepared and nanoindented under HBSS), the {{influence of}} long-term storage under HBSS at ca. 4 oC, {{and the influence of}} <b>deep-freezing</b> under dry and wet conditions, respectively. The reversibility of chemical dehydration and the consequences of multiple <b>deep-freezing</b> cycles were also investigated. Two premolars of a twelve-years-old human male were chosen for evaluation. The absolute values of the mechanical properties differed by a factor of ~ 2 and ~ 3 between dry and wet state, whereas trends were conserved. <b>Deep-freezing</b> wet dentin samples deteriorated their mechanical properties by about 20 to 28 %, whereas dehydrated samples suffered no damage.

40|$|A {{consolidated}} composite sorbent {{made from}} manganese chloride and expanded graphite was produced for sorption <b>deep-freezing</b> processes {{and used for}} cold production at a temperature as low as - 35 Â Â°C. Experimental {{results showed that the}} addition of a porous graphite matrix can prevent the agglomeration and the attenuation of sorption capacity of reactive salt. The composite sorbent could incorporate 0. 537 Â kg of ammonia per kg of reactive salt and the average specific cooling power (SCP) obtained varied between 200 Â WÂ kg- 1 and 700 Â WÂ kg- 1 when the evaporation temperature ranged from - 35 Â Â°C to 0 Â Â°C. The analysis of the data suggested that the heat transfer characteristic in the composite sorbent was strongly influenced by chemical reaction and the conversion rate was very sensitive to the constraint temperatures. The SCP and coefficient of performance (COP) of a simple sorption <b>deep-freezing</b> system were 350 Â WÂ kg- 1 and 0. 34, respectively, at the generation temperature of 180 Â Â°C, the heat sink temperature of 25 Â Â°C and the evaporation temperature of - 30 Â Â°C.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of thermodynamic performances of sorption systems (liquid absorption, adsorption, ammonia salts and metal hydrides) {{is carried out}} for typical applications (<b>deep-freezing,</b> ice making, air-conditioning and heat pumping) with either air-cooled or water-cooled heat sink. The results are given in terms of cooling coefficient of performance (COP) (heating COP or coefficient of amplification (COA) for the heat pump), cooling (heating) power versus reactor volume or weight and thermodynamic efficiency. LiBr-water systems show the best results for air-conditioning except when small units are required (metal hydride systems lead to more compact units). Other systems, however, show better results for other applications (chemical reaction with ammonia salts for <b>deep-freezing,</b> adsorption for heat pumping).

40|$|A simple routine {{procedure}} for testing frost hardiness of woody species has been worked out, using Pinus silvestris (L.) as the experimental plant. Shoots or twigs {{are placed in}} <b>deep-freezes</b> maintained at different temperatures. The rate of cooling of the plant tissues depends on {{the temperature of the}} <b>deep-freeze.</b> It is more rapid than the rates usually employed in freezing tests. The merits and disadvantages of this freezing method are discussed. The degree of injury is determined by a modification of the conductivity method. The procedure has been used for determining changes in frost hardiness of Scots pine from October to May.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to study the}} seed-borne fungi of faba bean that attack the plants and reduce their yield in Egypt. The results provide a database for further study to control the pathogens. Twenty-six seed samples representing six faba bean cultivars collected {{from different parts of}} Egypt were used in this investigation. The blotter and <b>deep-freezing</b> methods were used. Surface- and non-surface-sterilized faba bean seeds were tested to detect and isolate the associated seed-borne fungi. The following 20 fungal species belonging to 13 genera were observed and identified: Aspergillus flavus (Link ex. Gray), Aspergillus niger (Van Tieghem), Aspergillus ochraceus (Wilhelm), Penicillium digitatum (Pers. :Fr.) Sacc., Penicillium italicum (Wehmer), Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissler, Botrytis faba (Sardina), Cephalosporium sp., Cladosporium cladosporioides (Frensen. de Vries), Epicoccum nigrum (Link), Fusarium oxysporum (Schlechlendahl), Fusarium semitectum (Berkeley and Ravenel), Fusarium solani (Mart.) Sacc., Fusarium verticillioides (moniliforme) (Sheld), Rhizoctonia solani (Kühn), Rhizopus stolonifer (Ehr. ex Fr.), Stemphylium globuliferum (Vestergr.) E. G. Simmons), Trichothecium roseum (Pers.) Link, Verticillium dahliae (Ehrenp) Vuill. The blotter method yielded a greater number of fungi than the <b>deep-freezing</b> method on both surface and non-surface sterilized seeds, but the <b>deep-freezing</b> method was better for slow-growing fungi. The pathogenicity test revealed that the most commonly isolated fungi from pre- and post-emergence damping-off and stunted seedlings were F. verticillioides, R. solani, Cephalosporium sp. and V. dahliae. These fungi significantly reduced the photosynthetic pigments in faba bean leaves. Fusarium verticillioides caused the greatest reduction in chlorophyll content (A, B and total chlorophyll). Fusarium oxysporum and V. dahliae significantly reduced carotenoid content. R. solani significantly reduced total phenols content when compared with the other tested fungi...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} preparation of <b>deep-freeze</b> L. major (RHOM/IR/ 75 /ER) Promastigotes and their ability for producing skin lesions in appropriate animal model (outbred mice). Two hundred and thirty seven out bred mice were divided into two groups. Group 1 (135) was inoculated 0. 1 mL of Leishmania suspension subcutaneously. Group 2 (102) was injected by isotonic normal saline with the same procedure as control. The lesions were measured and parasitological examination performed too. Cutaneous lesions due to Leishmania major were manifested from one to six months post inoculation. Fifty eight of rest mice (63 %) from interventional group were leishmnial infected six months post inoculation versus none of the mice from control group showed any lesion. In interventional group, Leishmanin Skin Test (LST) conversion after 72 h was significantly higher than the control group (54. 1 vs. 4. 3 %, p < 0. 05).
