50|$|Cultivars of this grass include 'South African Robusta Blue', 'Witbank', 'Ermelo', 'Kromarrai', 'American Leafy', and 'Renner'. Cultivars may be {{selected}} for yield, palatability for livestock, and drought resistance. It is planted along waterways in Sri Lanka and mountainsides in Japan, {{and it is}} used for oversowing fields in Argentina. In the United States it is often planted alongside <b>Korean</b> <b>lespedeza.</b> It is planted as a nurse crop for sericea lespedeza, coastal panic grass, and switchgrass.|$|E
40|$|ALFALFA {{meals are}} {{generally}} used in- poultry rations {{as a source}} of vita-min A activity and riboflavin. The use of lespedeza meals in poultry feeding is not a common practice although the production of lespedezas has been increasing rapidly and their value as pasture, forage, and soil building crops is well recognized. Ringrose and Morgan (1940) reported that Korean and lespedeza sericea meals could be used to replace a similar amount of alfalfa leaf meal in poultry rations. Fur-ther work by these authors (1941) dem-onstrated that <b>Korean</b> <b>lespedeza</b> and lespe-deza sericea meals were excellent sources of vitamin A activity. They found that the carotenes of the lespedezas were as well utilized by the chick as those of dehy-drated alfalfa leaf meal. Ringrose and Morgan (1942) also re-ported on the use of lespedeza meals {{as a source of}} riboflavin for chicks. Slightly greater growth rates were obtained with <b>Korean</b> <b>lespedeza</b> meals (sun and shade cured) than with lespedeza sericea and de-hydrated alfalfa leaf meals when thes...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} Meloidogyne trifoliophila to gall 230 species and cultivars of plants was {{determined}} in a greenhouse. All clovers (Trifolium spp.) were severely galled regardless of species or cultivar. Most soybean cultivars were moderately to severely galled. Among other legumes, broad bean, garden pea, <b>Korean</b> <b>lespedeza,</b> sweetclover, and common vetch were good hosts, but alfalfa, bird's-foot trefoil, peanut, and pole bean were poor or nonhosts. Among other plant families, most Apiaceae (Umbelliferae) and Brassicaceae (Cruciferae) were galled, but Cucurbitaceae, Iridaceae, Malvaceae, Poaceae, and Solanaceae were {{rarely or never}} galled. Results for Amaryllidaceae, Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, and Liliaceae were variable. This nematode was not found {{in a survey of}} pasture and soybean fields in southwestern Tennessee...|$|E
40|$|Many {{letters are}} {{received}} annually by the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station requesting {{information on the}} different legumes and grasses. This publication has been prepared to answer the more important questions pertaining to the choice of legumes and grasses for different uses and conditions. 2 Legumes of greatest value for different uses or soil conditions in Iowa are (1) alfalfa, (2) medium red clover, (3) mammoth red clover, (4) alsike clover, (5) white clover, (6) the biennial white and yellow sweet clovers, (7) hubam clover, (the annual white sweet clover) (8) <b>Korean</b> <b>lespedeza,</b> (9) dalea and (10) soybeans. A discussion of soybeans is largely omitted in this publication since the growing of this crop is entirely {{different from that of}} the others. ...|$|E
40|$|Overseeding forage legumes into {{existing}} warm-season pasture {{may help}} to reduce cool-season forage deficit on small and resource-limited small farms in the southern Great Plains of the United States. Unimproved warm-season grass pastures were over-seeded with <b>Korean</b> <b>lespedeza</b> (Lespedeza stipulacea Maxim) or were not overseeded with summer legume. These same plots were subsequently overseeded with hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), crownvetch (Coronilla varia L.), black medic (Medicago lupulina L.) or ladino white clover (Trifolium repens L.) or, not overseeded with cool-season legume. Including lespedeza in a forage mixture increased total forage yield {{by an average of}} 15 %, or 1700 kg ha- 1 over 4 years. Overseeding with cool-season legumes provided a net benefit in total annual forage yield of 0. 75 kg for each 1. 0 kg o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Cessation {{of mining}} {{operations}} in Ducktown, TN, left 800 - 900 acres of barren copper mine tailings. Revegetation activities {{had met with}} limited success. In 1998, efforts for revegetation of the tailings materials began anew. The objective of this case history is to provide insight into decision making processes which resulted in conversion of 800 - 900 acres of barren mine tailings into a vegetated, productive landscape. Phase 1 began with intensive analyses of the tailings materials. Acid-base accounting registered a generally neutral to alkaline pH. Scattered areas were more acid with pH values measuring as low as 1. 9. Neutralization potential was adequate in most cases to counteract potential acid formation. Total elemental analysis indicated a maximum of 416 mg kg- 1 P (total) with essentially none plant available {{as measured by the}} bicarbonate P method. Utilizing these data, phase 2 was initiated with the installation of two one-acre plots with variables of 1) P treatments (0, 50, 100, and 200 lb acre- 1), 2) biosolid / non-biosolid applications, and 3) fescue / legumes (birdsfoot trefoil, sericea lespedeza, <b>Korean</b> <b>lespedeza,</b> and Kobe lespedeza). Korean and Kobe lespedeza/fescue on biosolids with 100 lb P acre- 1 were most productive...|$|E
