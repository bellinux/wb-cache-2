500|$|In 1976, Ontario singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot wrote, composed, and {{recorded}} the song [...] "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" [...] for his album Summertime Dream. On NPR's Saturday Morning Edition on February 14, 2015, Gordon Lightfoot {{said he was}} inspired to write the song {{when he saw the}} name misspelled [...] "Edmond" [...] in Newsweek magazine two weeks after the sinking; Lightfoot said he felt that it dishonored the memory of the 29 who died. Lightfoot's popular ballad made the sinking of Fitzgerald one of the better-known disasters in the history of Great Lakes shipping. The original lyrics of the song show a degree of artistic license compared to the events of the actual sinking: it states the destination as Cleveland instead of Detroit and, in light of new evidence about what happened, Lightfoot has modified one line for live performances, changing “When suppertime came the old cook came on deck / Saying ‘Fellas, it’s too rough to feed ya.’ / At 7 p.m. a main hatchway caved in / He said, ‘Fellas, it's been <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> ya.” to “When suppertime came the old cook came on deck / Saying ‘Fellows it’s too rough to feed ya.’ / At 7 p.m. it grew dark, it was then / He said, ‘Fellas, it's been <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> ya.’” The song has been covered by many performers. The Toronto rock band Rheostatics recorded it for their second album, Melville, and their live album Double Live. The Dandy Warhols also covered the song in their The Black Album in 2004.|$|E
500|$|May 3, 2006, was {{the premiere}} of Dylan's radio {{presenting}} career, hosting a weekly radio program, Theme Time Radio Hour, for XM Satellite Radio, with song selections revolving around a chosen theme. Dylan played classic and obscure records from the 1930s to the present day, including contemporary artists as diverse as Blur, Prince, L.L. Cool J and the Streets. The show was praised by fans and critics as [...] "great radio," [...] as Dylan told stories and made eclectic references with his sardonic humor, while achieving a thematic beauty with his musical choices. In April 2009, Dylan broadcast the 100th show in his radio series; the theme was [...] "Goodbye" [...] and the final record played was Woody Guthrie's [...] "So Long, It's Been <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> Yuh".

500|$|When first {{published}} in 1945, The North Ship received just one review, in the Coventry Evening Telegraph, which concluded [...] "Mr Larkin has an inner vision that must be sought for with care. His recondite imagery is couched in phrases that make up {{in a kind of}} wistful hinted beauty what they lack in lucidity. Mr Larkin's readers must at present be confined to a small circle. Perhaps his work will gain wider appeal as his genius becomes more mature?" [...] A few years later, though, the poet and critic Charles Madge came across the book and wrote to Larkin with his compliments. When the collection was reissued in 1966 it was presented as a work of juvenilia, and the reviews were gentle and respectful; the most forthright praise came from Elizabeth Jennings in The Spectator: [...] "few will question the intrinsic value of The North Ship or the importance of its being reprinted now. It is <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that Larkin could write so well when still so young." ...|$|E

On July 15, 2005, {{the school was}} awarded a $60,000 federal fund for energy efficiency 39% below the national energy threshold; this would save the New Brunswick government $115,193 per year, or an eventual $2 million over 20 years. The province's educational minister, Madelaine Dubé, said: [...] "It is <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that our schools can also contribute to protecting our environment." [...] The school held its inauguration ceremony with Bernard Lord present on September 30, 2005, despite its delayed opening {{a few days after}} the beginning of the 200506 school year. Lord spoke of his government's intention to add schools to the growing number of Francophone institutions in New Brunswick, as well as advancing the state of the province's education.

500|$|On 20 May, two {{flights of}} F-86 Sabres {{encountered}} multiple MiG-15s in MiG Alley, and through radio communications, two additional flights of F-86 Sabres joined the battle, including Jabara. In {{preparation for the}} oncoming battle, Jabara and the other F-86 Sabre pilots were ordered to jettison their auxiliary fuel tanks to improve their maneuverability. Jabara's fuel tank failed to separate from his wing, and protocol required he return to base as the aircraft would be impeded by the extra weight and imbalance, and limit his potential to match off with a MiG. However, Jabara decided to continue to the air battle, where {{he was able to}} still handle his aircraft well enough to be credited with shooting down two MiG-15s with [...]50 caliber machine gun fire. The first was in a group of three MiGs and the other was the last in a six-plane group. Jabara was able to see the first aircraft explode from his gunfire, but he only saw his second victory go into a tailspin as he was avoiding being targeted by another MiG. His fifth and sixth victories made Jabara the first American in history to use jet aircraft to become an ace. The Americans said the 20-minute air battle had included 36 F-86 Sabres against nearly 50 MiG-15s (Russian data shows 30 MiGs), and the American pilots recorded Jabara's two victories and another pilot's [...] "probable". While returning to base, Jabara's F-86 Sabre was so low on fuel, he turned off the engine and glided towards the base before turning it on prior to landing. Data-matching with Soviet records made available {{since the end of the}} Cold War has since shown that only one MiG was lost in the combat, and that Jabara's jet-versus-jet tally was four at best. Nevertheless, American military forces claimed that Jabara was the first jet-versus-jet ace. Jabara later stated in an interview, [...] "That was my bag for the day, and it made me feel pretty <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that I was the first jet ace in the history of aerial warfare." [...] The mission was his 63rd Korean mission of an eventual 163; he was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second-highest decoration.|$|E
500|$|Mark Schilling of The Japan Times {{rated the}} film 5 out of 5 stars and {{observed}} that Summer Wars [...] "may contain familiar elements, beginning with its bashful, moonstruck young hero, but it combines them in ways fresh, contemporary and dazzlingly imaginative". He {{also said that}} the film provides a social commentary on the differences between an [...] "analog world" [...] and a [...] "realm of digital devices". Schilling titled his article [...] "The future king of Japanese animation may be with us; Hosoda steps out of Miyazaki's shadow with dazzling new film". He praised Sadamoto, Aoyama and Nishida for producing [...] "scenes of animated spectacle that, in their dazzling fluency of motion and untethered brilliance of invention, makes the usual SF/fantasy anime look childish and dull". Twitch Film published a review by Guillem Rosset who also referenced Miyazaki noting that following The Girl Who Leapt Through Time [...] "cries went out immediately hailing him [...] as the heir apparent". He claimed that with Summer Wars, [...] "Hosoda is the new king, the best story teller working within the animated medium in Japan and– quite possibly– the world." [...] Rosset praised the film itself as [...] "richly detailed and beautifully written...gorgeous to look at." [...] and [...] "blessed with an extensive cast of stunningly detailed and authentic characters." [...] He concluded by saying [...] "Hosoda has perfectly balanced the need to entertain via the visuals with the rich and satisfying character work that separates him from the massive pack of quality technicians to establish himself as truly a master story teller." [...] He also noted that [...] "The wonderful cast of characters is one of the film's greatest strengths" [...] while also highlighting that, of the virtual world of OZ, [...] "Here the creative minds of Madhouse can let their imagination run wild." [...] With regards to the technical aspects, Rosset called the film [...] "a top class audiovisual show." [...] He concluded by writing [...] "Mamoru Hosada deserves a place {{as one of the top}} contemporary Japanese animators. And it's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that once the time comes for Miyazaki to retire (not too soon I hope!) there's people capable of following his steps." [...] The Korean newspaper Herald Business saw the film's fantasy theme and gorgeous animation as a differentiator from works produced by Hollywood studios.|$|E

The Eleventh Doctor's dismissal of the Tenth Doctor and War Doctor as [...] "Sandshoes and Grandad" [...] to mock their respective footwear and age echo the First Doctor's description of his two successors in The Three Doctors as [...] "a dandy and a clown". (The War Doctor's initial incredulous reaction upon seeing his future selves also reflects this moment.) Likewise, a Time Lord says, [...] "I didn't know when I was well-off. All twelve of them."

2500|$|May's public reticence {{during the}} {{referendum}} campaign resulted in tensions with David Cameron and his pro-EU team. Following the referendum and her election as party leader, May signalled {{that she would}} support full withdrawal from the EU and prioritise immigration controls over remaining within the single market, leading some to contrast this with her earlier remarks on the earlier economic arguments. She later {{went on to say}} before the 2017 UK general election that she would be willing to leave the EU without a deal, saying that [...] "no deal is better than a bad deal. We {{have to be prepared to}} walk out". The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said it was [...] "disappointing that Theresa May lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of Brexit. More disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge, she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self-harm on the UK economy by pulling Britain out of the single market." [...] Phil Wilson for the 'Open Britain' group said, [...] "It's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that privately Theresa May thinks what many of us have been saying publicly for a long time, leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy.

2500|$|In 1950, the Almanacs were reconstituted as the Weavers, {{named after}} the title of an 1892 play by Gerhart Hauptmann about a workers' strike (which {{contained}} the lines, [...] "We'll stand it no more, come what may!"). They did benefits for strikers at which they sang songs such as 'Talking Union', about the struggles for unionisation of industrial workers such as miners and auto mobile workers. Besides Pete Seeger (performing under his own name), members of the Weavers included charter Almanac member Lee Hays, Ronnie Gilbert, and Fred Hellerman; later Frank Hamilton, Erik Darling, and Bernie Krause serially took Seeger's place. In {{the atmosphere of the}} 1950s red scare, the Weavers' repertoire had to be less overtly topical than that of the Almanacs had been, and its progressive message was couched in indirect language—arguably rendering it even more powerful. The Weavers on occasion performed in tuxedos (unlike the Almanacs, who had dressed informally) and their managers refused to let them perform at political venues. The Weavers' string of major hits began with [...] "On Top of Old Smoky" [...] and an arrangement of Lead Belly's signature waltz, [...] "Goodnight, Irene", which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950 and was covered by many other pop singers. On the flip side of [...] "Irene" [...] was the Israeli song [...] "Tzena, Tzena, Tzena". Other Weaver hits included [...] "Dusty Old Dust" [...] ("So Long It's Been <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> You" [...] by Woody Guthrie), [...] "Kisses Sweeter Than Wine" [...] (by Hays, Seeger, and Lead Belly), and the South African Zulu song by Solomon Linda, [...] "Wimoweh" [...] (about Shaka), among others.|$|E

[...] Ciara then outlined plans for a mixtape to precede the album's release, in preparation she recorded remixes to Soulja Boy Tell 'Em's [...] "Pretty Boy Swag" [...] ("Pretty Girl Swag") and Waka Flocka Flame's [...] "Hard in Da Paint", {{as well as a}} cover of Young Jeezy's [...] "Lose My Mind". When asked by Gerrick D.

I one day look forward to being able to share with my fans (things that happen).' Right now, this is about living in a world of possibility and doing my best, [...]. Getting the record out there, I just want my fans to hear it. This album is really for my fans, and it's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the energy and the feedback has been great.

In addition to disagreeing with the label over single choices, Ciara personally funded the $100,000 video for her third single [...] "Gimmie Dat".

2500|$|The folk {{revival in}} New York City {{was rooted in}} the resurgent {{interest}} in square dancing and folk dancing there in the 1940s, which gave musicians such as Pete Seeger popular exposure. The folk revival more generally as a popular and commercial phenomenon begins with the career of The Weavers, formed in November 1948 by Pete Seeger, Lee Hays, Fred Hellerman, and Ronnie Gilbert of People's Songs, of which Seeger had been president and Hays executive secretary. People's Songs, which disbanded in 1948–49, had been a clearing house for labor movement songs (and in particular, the CIO, {{which at the time}} {{was one of the few}} if not the only union that was racially integrated), and in 1948 had thrown all its resources to the failed presidential campaign of Progressive Party candidate Henry Wallace, a folk-music aficionado (his running mate was a country-music singer-guitarist). Hays and Seeger had formerly sung together as the politically activist Almanac Singers, a group which they founded in 1941 and whose personnel often included Woody Guthrie, Josh White, Lead Belly, Cisco Houston, and Bess Lomax Hawes. The Weavers had a big hit in 1950 with the single of Lead Belly's [...] "Goodnight, Irene". This was number one on the Billboard charts for thirteen weeks. On its flip side was [...] "Tzena, Tzena, Tzena", an Israeli dance song that concurrently reached number two on the charts. This was followed by a string of Weaver hit singles that sold millions, including [...] ""So Long It's Been <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> You" [...] ("Dusty Old Dust") (by Woody Guthrie) and [...] "Kisses Sweeter Than Wine". The Weavers' career ended abruptly when they were dropped from Decca's catalog because Pete Seeger had been listed in the publication Red Channels as a probable subversive. Radio stations refused to play their records and concert venues canceled their engagements. A former employee of People's Songs, Harvey Matusow, himself a former Communist Party member, had informed the FBI that the Weavers were Communists, too, although Matusow later recanted and admitted he had lied. Pete Seeger and Lee Hays were called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1955. Despite this, a Christmas Weaver reunion concert in 1955 was a smash success and the Vanguard LP album of that concert, issued in 1957, was one of the top sellers of that year, followed by other successful albums.|$|E
