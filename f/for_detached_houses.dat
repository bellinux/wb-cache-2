Overall, many buildings are from the 1960 ’s or earlier having a relatively high energy demand, creating opportunities for large energy savings. The major means of heating are electricity <b>for</b> <b>detached</b> <b>houses</b> and district heating for multi dwelling houses and premises. Cooling needs are relatively low but steadily increasing, emphasizing the need to consider energy storage for both heat and cold. The thermal mass of a building is important for passive storage of thermal energy but this has not been considered much when constructing buildings in Sweden. Instead, common ways of storing thermal energy in Swedish buildings today is in water storage tanks or in the ground using boreholes, while latent thermal energy storage is still very uncommon.

The analysis includes the whole energy system, from the natural resource to the end user, with respect to primary energy use, emission and cost. The end-use technologies studied are heat pumps, resistance heaters and boilers. It was assumed that the base-load electricity, except for the cogenerated electricity, was produced in stand-alone power plants using wood chips or natural gas, while peak-load electricity and fuel used for transportation were produced from crude oil. The heat pump and district heating systems are found to be most energy efficient, followed by the local fuel-based systems. The wood-fuel-based systems emit about one tenth of the greenhouse gases emitted by the natural-gas-based systems. The sulphur and nitrogen oxide emission, however, is higher for wood-fuel-based systems. Systems based on natural gas are less expensive than the corresponding wood-fuel-based systems. Decarbonization and carbon dioxide sequestration, however, do not reduce the carbon dioxide emission to the low level of the wood-fuel-based systems and, in addition, make the natural-gas-based systems more expensive than the wood-fuel-based systems.

Wind power driven heat pumps have been considered as a sustainable measure to supply heat <b>for</b> <b>detached</b> <b>houses,</b> especially those that even don’t {{have access to the}} grid. This work is to investigate the dynamic performance of a heat pump system directly driven by a wind turbine. The heat demand of a detached single family house was simulated in details. According to the simulations, the wind turbine is not able to provide the electricity demanded bythe heat pump all the time due to the intermittent characteristic of wind power. To solve it, an electric energy storage system was included. Obviously, increasingthe size of battery can always reduce the probability of load loss. However, different from the energy storage system, increasing the capacity of wind turbines is not necessary to reducethe probability of load loss instead, due to the different start-up speedsfor different capacities of wind turbines. In order to maximize the system benefit, it is of great importance to optimize the capacity of the wind turbine {{and the size of the}} energy storage system simultaneously based on dynamic simulations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recently, {{there have}} been a lot of {{earthquakes}} in Japan. It is necessary to promote seismic isolation devices for buildings. The devices have been hardly diffused in attached houses, because the devices are very expensive. We should develop a low-cost seismic isolation device <b>for</b> <b>detached</b> <b>houses.</b> We suggested a new seismic isolation device which uses a two-layer circular tube as a unit. If hysteresis is produced in the two-layer circular tube under lateral compression load, we think that the two-layer circular tube can have energy absorbing capacity. It is necessary to contact the outer layer and the inner layer to produce hysteresis. We have previously reported how the inner layer comes in contact with the outer layer from a perspective of analysis used mechanics of materials. We have clarified that the inner layer comes in contact with the outer layer under a lateral compression load. In this paper, we explored contact area between the outer layer and the inner layer under a lateral compression load by using FEA. We think that changing the inner layer’s thickness is effective in increase the contact area. In order to change the inner layer’s thickness, we changed the shape of the inner layer. As a result, the contact area changes depending on the inner layer’s thickness. Additionally, we experimented to check whether hysteresis occurs in fact. As a consequence, we can reveal hysteresis in the two-layer circular tube under the condition. Keywords—Contact area, energy absorbing capacity, hysteresis, seismic isolation device. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{world is}} today facing major challenges, which of is the urgent {{replacement}} {{of fossil fuels}} to renewable alternatives. UN reports of serious consequences for our climate mainly caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases. The utilization of solar energy is considered as an important resource in the transition towards a more climate-neutral energy society. The usage of solar electricity has recently experienced great growth in Sweden while technology developed and price declined. The usage of solar heating system in Sweden has however not experienced the same increase in amount and attention. This master thesis is mainly purposed to investigate and compare different system of solar heating and solar electricity from the energy performance, economic and environmental perspective. The solar generated electricity could power a heat pump to meet the property´s heating demand, while a solar panel {{would be able to}} contribute a large amount of the property´s heating and hot water. The investigation shows a higher profitability for the solar heating systems compared to solar electricitysystems at current electricity price levels <b>for</b> <b>detached</b> <b>houses</b> {{in the northern part of}} Sweden. Solar heating systems show less environmental impacts and as well as better energy performance. A solar thermal system combined with a geothermal heat pump can result in economic profits as well as environmental benefits.

40|$|Air {{pressure}} {{conditions in}} typical Finnish residences are analysed {{using data from}} field measurements and computer simulations. Field measurements were conducted in three two-storey detached houses and in two five-storey apartment buildings. The effects of air tightness, ventilation performance, air leakage distributions, and outdoor environmental conditions on air pressure conditions in a detached house were simulated with a multi-zone simulation model using the IDA ICE simulation program. Despite of common design assumption, negative air pressure difference indoors, {{the results show that}} there is almost always a positive and negative air pressure difference across the building envelope in detached houses and apartment buildings. <b>For</b> <b>detached</b> <b>houses,</b> the design value of the air pressure difference across the building envelope for moisture convection analysis should be at least 10 Pa. In the most critical cases (airtight building envelope with unbalanced ventilation), the air pressure difference across the building envelope may rise up to 30 Pa. To control extremely high air pressure differences in airtight houses, balancing ventilation systems are very important. As in new low-energy houses the airtight building envelope and mechanical supply and exhaust ventilation become the standard solution; the interaction between HVAC systems and building envelope should be carefully designed. Practical application: Based on field measurements and computer simulations the design value of air pressure difference across the building envelope is determined for Finnish dwellings. Results underline the importance of balancing of ventilation in airtight house otherwise is not possible to control extremely high air pressure differences. If ventilation system should control the air pressure difference, building envelope should be airtight, because in normal and leaky houses (n 5044 1 /h) the differences in ventilation airflows are too small and they have only a minor influence on the air pressure difference. ...|$|E
