500|$|For one, Cobb has {{stressed}} the problems inherent <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> the “substantialist” worldview—ultimately derived from Classical Greek philosophy—that still dominates Christian theology, {{as well as}} most of western thought. [...] This [...] "substantialist" [...] way of thinking necessitates a mind-matter dualism, in which matter and mind are two fundamentally different kinds of entities. [...] It also encourages seeing relations between entities as being unimportant to what the entity is [...] "in itself." [...] In contrast to this view, Cobb follows Whitehead in attributing primacy to events and processes rather than substances. [...] In this Whiteheadian view, nothing is contained within its own sharp boundaries. [...] In fact, the way in which a thing relates to other things is what makes it [...] "what it is." [...] Cobb writes: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Wah-Wah" [...] {{was never}} {{offered to the}} Beatles once Harrison joined the {{proceedings}} at Apple Studio. The choice of Harrison songs that would {{end up on the}} Let It Be album in May 1970 – [...] "I Me Mine" [...] and [...] "For You Blue" [...] – has led some authors to speculate that he deliberately withdrew his higher-quality compositions rather than risk having them played without the attention they deserved. Leng lists [...] "Wah-Wah" [...] among a number of solo Beatles songs that are [...] "self-referential" [...] in their lyrical theme and serve as episodes <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> [...] "the Beatles soap opera". Harrison's bitterness at the restrictions imposed on him during the Beatles years resurfaced explicitly in [...] "Who Can See It", a song written in 1972.|$|E

500|$|Columbia Journalism Review {{gave the}} book a {{favorable}} review, noting, [...] "This is a lively, garrulous account by an activist who was {{deeply involved in}} turning back the threat of regulation and, {{at least for the}} time being, securing rights of free expression online." [...] The review described the latter portion of the book as [...] "a more intense personal chronicle of Godwin's deep involvement <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> the 'cyberporn panic' – the push to control Internet content." [...] Columbia Journalism Review concluded, [...] "Ultimately, Godwin shows, this strong response laid the groundwork for lawsuits that enabled the Supreme Court to declare the 'decency' amendment unconstitutional. He was in the thick of things throughout this effort, and his journal lets the reader relive the tension and uncertainty of trying to halt a media stampede before it crushed everything in its path." ...|$|E
500|$|Whitehead has {{had some}} {{influence}} on philosophy of business administration and organizational theory. [...] This has led {{in part to a}} focus on identifying and investigating the effect of temporal events (as opposed to static things) within organizations through an “organization studies” discourse that accommodates a variety of 'weak' and 'strong' process perspectives from a number of philosophers. [...] One of the leading figures having an explicitly Whiteheadian and panexperientialist stance towards management is Mark Dibben, who works <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> [...] "applied process thought" [...] to articulate a philosophy of management and business administration as part of a wider examination of the social sciences through the lens of process metaphysics. For Dibben, this allows [...] "a comprehensive exploration of life as perpetually active experiencing, as opposed to occasional – and thoroughly passive – happening." [...] Dibben has published two books on applied process thought, [...] (2008), and [...] (2009), as well as other papers in this vein in the fields of philosophy of management and business ethics.|$|E
500|$|The One Hot Minute tour began {{several days}} {{after the release of}} the album. The band opened the tour with a European leg. Kiedis felt that as a musician, he was {{becoming}} somewhat lackluster. The short European leg ended in early November, and the U.S. portion was scheduled to begin 10 days later; however, it was postponed until early February. A few shows into the commencement of the U.S. leg, Kiedis badly injured his leg while engaging <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> [...] "eyes-closed robotic dancing". He tripped over a monitor and fell off the stage, ending up hanging by his calf from his microphone cable, resulting in a cast which he wore for the next two months. Kiedis reflected that it [...] "was nice to see that people were still interested in coming out to see what we do", as there had been a four-year gap since the release of Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Following the conclusion of the U.S. tour, the Chili Peppers took two weeks off before several Australia and New Zealand performances. The band then played at the Tibetan Freedom Concert in San Francisco, before finishing the tour in Europe.|$|E

2500|$|In Truth and Narrative, he has deconstructed the essentialist {{conception}} of Islam projected by Orientalists and Islamists alike.

2500|$|Activist Warren Farrell {{has written}} of {{his views on}} how men are uniquely marginalized <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> their [...] "disposability", {{the manner in which}} the most {{dangerous}} occupations, notably soldiering and mining, were historically performed exclusively by men and remain so today. In his book, The Myth of Male Power, Farrell argues that patriarchal societies do not make rules to benefit men at the expense of women. Farrell contends that nothing is more telling about who has benefited from [...] "men's rules" [...] than life expectancy, which is lower in males, and suicide rates, which are higher in males.|$|E
2500|$|Working {{initially}} {{from research}} documents, texts or striking {{images in the}} popular press, Gerrard uses {{the internet as a}} research tool, <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> 'image wandering'. This subsequently leads to exploratory journeys, during which subjects are often discovered by chance. Once a structure is selected for a 'portrait', the artist takes a comprehensive set of several thousand photographs of surfaces and surroundings. These photographs are used in the studio as textures for a reconstructed, hand-built virtual 3d model of the structure, which in turn is then placed within a 'virtual world' that incorporates the passing of time and other environmental elements.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{philosophical}} {{investigations into}} death examine the healthcare's profession {{heavy reliance on}} science and technology (SciTech). This reliance is especially evident in Western medicine. Even so, Heidegger makes ang allusion to this reliance <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> the allure or [...] "character of exactness." [...] In effect, people are inherently attached to [...] "exactness" [...] because {{it gives them a}} sense of purpose or reason {{in a world that is}} largely defined by what appears to be [...] and irrationality. And as the moment of death is approaching, a moment marked by utter confusion and fear, people frantically attempt to pinpoint a final sense of meaning in their lives.|$|E
2500|$|Eliyahu M. Goldratt {{developed}} the Theory of Constraints {{in part to}} address the cost-accounting problems <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> the [...] "cost world." [...] He offers a substitute, called throughput accounting, that uses throughput (money for goods sold to customers) in place of output (goods produced that may sell or may boost inventory) and considers labor as a fixed {{rather than as a}} variable cost. He defines inventory simply as everything the organization owns that it plans to sell, including buildings, machinery, and many other things in addition to the categories listed here. Throughput accounting recognizes only one class of variable costs: the truly variable costs, like materials and components, which vary directly with the quantity produced ...|$|E
