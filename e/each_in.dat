40|$|We {{develop an}} {{integrated}} mixed-integer linear programming model for production-distribution and transportation planning in three-stage supply chains (SCs). The model has two versions, the fully optimized version (FOV) {{and the less}} fully optimized (LFOV). Each of the versions determines the optimal quantity of each product to be produced at <b>each</b> plant <b>in</b> <b>each</b> period, kept <b>in</b> inventory at <b>each</b> plant <b>in</b> <b>each</b> period, transported to each distribution centre (DC) from <b>each</b> plant <b>in</b> <b>each</b> period, subcontracted at <b>each</b> DC, kept <b>in</b> inventory at <b>each</b> DC, and transported from each DC to <b>each</b> retailer <b>in</b> <b>each</b> period. It also determines the optimal amount of extensions needed at <b>each</b> DC <b>in</b> <b>each</b> period. Examples given to test and compare the {{two versions of the}} model show that they work very well. In all the examples, the optimal objective-function values produced by the FOV are greater than those produced by the LFOV. The examples also show that using a single model to integrate and optimize all the stages and key components of a SC simultaneous can greatly enhance an organization’s operational efficiency and financial performance. </p...|$|R
