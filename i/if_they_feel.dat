5|$|Fishers {{have had}} a long history of contact with humans, but most of it has been to the {{detriment}} of fisher populations. Unprovoked attacks on humans are extremely rare, but fishers will attack <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> threatened or cornered. In one case, a fisher was blamed for an attack on a six-year-old boy. In another case, a fisher is believed to be responsible for an attack on a twelve-year-old boy.|$|E
5|$|Predators of the {{red panda}} include the snow leopard, mustelids, and humans. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> {{threatened}} or sense danger, they may try to escape by climbing a rock column or tree. If {{they can no longer}} flee, they stand on their hind legs to make themselves appear larger and use the sharp claws on their front paws to defend themselves. A red panda, Futa, became a visitor attraction in Japan for his ability to stand upright for ten seconds at a time.|$|E
5|$|Mallards {{are also}} preyed upon by other {{waterside}} apex predators, {{such as the}} grey heron, European herring gull, the wels catfish, and the northern pike. Crows (Corvus) are also known to kill ducklings and adults on occasion. Also, mallards may be attacked by larger anseriformes such as swans (Cygnus) and geese during the breeding season, and are frequently driven off by these birds over territorial disputes. Mute swans (C. olor) {{have been known to}} attack or even kill mallards <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> that the ducks pose a threat to their offspring.|$|E

Consumers were advised to stop using the products if they experience hives or itching, and to seek emergency medical attention <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> faint, or experience throat tightness, breathing problems, or swelling of the eyes, face, lips or tongue. The FDA noted that it remains unclear whether the reactions are caused by the active ingredients, inactive ingredients or a combination.|$|E

25|$|Individuals {{may also}} express latent dissent in {{response}} to functional and other-focused dissent-triggering. They determine to use latent instead of articulate when they believe that management is not receptive to employee dissent.

Latent dissent is also used in protective dissent–triggering events.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} some debate about whether hognoses are venomous.

25|$|Nesting {{most often}} occurs at night for {{protection}} from predators. The prime season for nesting is from December to June, butr peak months are January through March. Females are uneasy when coming ashore. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> threatened, they return to the water and wait until the shore is safer. Approximately two months after nesting the hatchlings emerge. They are around 46mm long when hatched, smaller than other Chelonia hatchlings.|$|E
25|$|Male {{southern}} house spiders sometimes appear aggressive, {{but they}} do not bite unless trapped, and their mouthparts are too small to easily penetrate human skin. They do, however, have an unnerving tendency to crawl across anything in their path regardless of whether it is alive. This is not aggression; these spiders are simply nearly blind and cannot see larger animals. Indeed, these spiders instinctively play dead <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> threatened (a tactic which is effective against their common predators).|$|E
25|$|There is a “HELP” {{phone system}} on campus.

These phones are easily recognizable by their bright blue light and have an emergency button that anyone can press which will automatically connect them to the UMass Police Department.

25|$|Retailers in Canada may refuse bank notes without {{breaking}} the law. According to legal guidelines, the method of payment has to be mutually agreed upon by the parties involved with the transactions. For example, stores may refuse $100 bank notes <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> that would put them {{at risk of being}} counterfeit victims; however, official policy suggests that the retailers should evaluate the impact of that approach. In the case that no mutually acceptable form of payment can be found for the tender, the parties involved should seek legal advice.|$|E
25|$|Dispensability in a {{group is}} {{described}} by Price as employees who join a work group and quickly begin to measure up their skills with {{the people that they}} are assigned to work with. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> that their skills are inferior to those around them, people tend to sit back and let the other more skilled workers carry the workload. Fairness {{in a group}} is when some group members feel that their voice is not heard in decision making because of their ethnicity, gender or other discriminatory factors. Instead of fighting for their voice to be heard many group members will decide to loaf in these circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The {{top five}} levels contain one {{division}} each and are nationwide in scope. Below this, the levels have progressively more parallel leagues, with each covering progressively smaller geographic areas. Many leagues {{have more than}} one division. At the lower levels the existence of leagues becomes intermittent, although in some of the more densely populated areas there are leagues more than twenty layers below the Premier League. There are also leagues {{in various parts of the}} country which are not officially part of the system as they do not have formal agreements with other leagues, but are recognised at various levels by county football associations.

25|$|Provisions from Dodd–Frank {{found in}} section 922 also address whistle blower protection. Under new {{regulations}} any whistle blowers who voluntarily expose inappropriate behavior in public corporations can {{be rewarded with}} substantial compensation and will have their jobs protected. Regulations entitle whistle blowers to between ten and thirty percent of any monetary sanctions put on the corporation above one million dollars. These provisions also enact anti-retaliation rules that entitle whistle blowers {{the right to have}} a jury trial <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> they have been wrongfully terminated as a result of whistle blowing. If the jury finds that whistle blowers have been wrongfully terminated, then they must be reinstated to their positions and receive compensation for any back-pay and legal fees. This rule also applies to any private subsidiaries of public corporations. The SEC put these regulations in place in May 2011.|$|E
25|$|The Order of the Arrow Founder's Award {{was first}} {{introduced}} at the 1981 National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC), {{following the death of}} Goodman.

Any lodge may present the award to up to two arrowmen annually; lodges with more than 1,000 members may present up to three awards, and lodges with more than 1,500 members may present up to four awards. No lodge may present more than four awards. If more than one Founder's Award is presented, at least one must be presented to a youth member under the age of 21. Lodges are not required to give the Founder's Award <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> that no one is worthy of it. A member may only receive the award once in his or her lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Common {{ostriches}} typically avoid {{humans in}} the wild, since they correctly assess humans as potential predators. If approached, they often run away, but sometimes ostriches {{can be very}} aggressive when threatened, especially if cornered, and may also attack <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> the need to defend their territories or offspring. Similar behaviors are noted in captive or domesticated common ostriches, which retain the same natural instincts and can occasionally respond aggressively to stress. When attacking a person, common ostriches deliver slashing kicks with their powerful feet, armed with long claws, with which they can disembowel or kill {{a person with a}} single blow. In one study of common ostrich attacks, it was estimated that two to three attacks that result in serious injury or death occur each year in the area of Oudtshoorn, South Africa, where a large number of common ostrich farms are set next to both feral and wild common ostrich populations.|$|E
