30|$|Methods <b>of</b> <b>wastewater</b> {{treatment}} {{were first}} developed {{in response to}} the adverse conditions caused by the discharge <b>of</b> <b>wastewater</b> to the environment and the concern for public health. Further, as cities became larger and larger, limited land was available for wastewater treatment and disposal, principally by irrigation and intermittent filtration. Also, as populations grew, the quantity <b>of</b> <b>wastewater</b> generated rose rapidly and the deteriorating quality of this huge amount <b>of</b> <b>wastewater</b> exceeded the self-purification capacity of the streams and river bodies.|$|R
50|$|His major {{innovation}} was {{improving the}} procedure for drilling crude oil. The Attock Oil Company at Rawalpindi (representative of Messers Steel Brothers & Co London) had confronted a peculiar problem, wherein the mud used for drilling operation got hardened upon contact with the saline water, thereby clogging the drill holes. Bhatnagar realised that this problem could be solved by colloidal chemistry. He added an Indian gum, which had the remarkable property of lowering the viscosity of the mud suspension and of increasing {{at the same time}} its stability against the flocculating action of electrolytes. M/s Steel Brothers was so pleased that they offered Bhatnagar a sum of Rs. 1,50,000/- for research work on any subject related to petroleum. The company placed the fund through the university and it was used to establish the Department of Petroleum Research under the guidance of Bhatnagar. Investigations carried out under this collaborative scheme included <b>deodourisation</b> <b>of</b> waxes, increasing flame height of kerosene and utilisation of waste products in vegetable oil and mineral oil industries. Acknowledging the commercial success of the research, the company increased the fund, and extended the period from five years to ten years.|$|R
40|$|Kuwait has {{recently}} implemented a vigorous campaign {{that aims to}} reclaim and reuse all treated wastewater in an at- tempt to alleviate water scarcity problem and to preserve seawater quality. This paper assesses the present status <b>of</b> <b>wastewater</b> treatment, reclamation and reuse in Kuwait, and discusses the impact <b>of</b> <b>wastewater</b> reuse on the amounts of pollutants discharged into the sea. Through analysis of the historical records <b>of</b> the <b>wastewater</b> treatment plants, {{it has been found}} that reuse <b>of</b> reclaimed <b>wastewater</b> in Kuwait has greatly reduced the amounts of pollutants discharged into the sea. Results showed that more than 50 % reduction in volumes <b>of</b> <b>wastewater</b> discharged into the sea had been achieved from year 2000 to year 2010. However, this study has predicted that the amounts <b>of</b> <b>wastewater</b> discharged into the sea will start increasing again by the year 2020 due to shortages of storage capacity for reclaimed wastewater and due to the limitation <b>of</b> <b>wastewater</b> reuse applications to basically agricultural and landscape irrigations. In contrary, the on-going works and future plans of the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) are expected to overcome this problem and lead to a zero discharge <b>of</b> <b>wastewater</b> into the sea...|$|R

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe main {{objective}} of the present Master thesis was to estimate the potential replacement of mineral fertilization in lettuce production by application of: 1) wastewater from aquaculture; 2) a mixture <b>of</b> <b>wastewater</b> from aquaculture with vermicompost leachates; and 3) wastewater from aquaculture + vermicompost. To achieve our objectives, three pilot-scale production units were built: an aquaculture unit, a vermicomposting unit and a poultry and rabbit production unit.
