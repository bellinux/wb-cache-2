"The {{relations}} of capital assume their most externalised and most fetish-like form in <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>capital.</b> We have here , money creating more money, self-expanding value, without {{the process that}} effectuates these two extremes. In merchant's capital, , {{there is at least}} the general form of the capitalistic movement, although it confines itself solely to the sphere of circulation, so that profit appears merely as profit derived from alienation; but it is at least seen to be the product of a social relation, not the product of a mere thing. (...) This is obliterated in , the form of <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>capital.</b> (...) The thing (money, commodity, value) is now capital even as a mere thing, and capital appears as a mere thing. The result of the entire process of reproduction appears as a property inherent in the thing itself. It depends on the owner of the money, i.e., of the commodity in its continually exchangeable form, whether he wants to spend it as money or loan it out as capital. In <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>capital,</b> therefore, this automatic fetish, self-expanding value, money generating money, are brought out in their pure state and in this form it no longer bears the birth-marks of its origin. The social relationis consummated in the relation of a thing, of money, to itself.—Instead of the actual transformation of money into capital, we see here only form without content."

5000|$|Volume 3 is subtitled [...] "The {{process of}} {{capitalist}} production as a whole" [...] and is concerned primarily {{with the internal}} differentiation of the capitalist class. The first three parts {{are concerned with the}} division of surplus value amongst individual capitals, where it takes the form of profit. The following parts are concerned with merchants' capital, <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>capital</b> and landed capital. The last part draws the whole account together. The aim of the volume as a whole is to 'locate and describe the concrete forms which grow out of the movements of capital as a whole...The various forms of capital,as evolved in this book, thus approach step by step the form which they assume on the surface of society, in the action of different capitals on one another in competition, and in the ordinary consciousness of the agents of production themselves." [...] (25) (Clarke).|$|E
5000|$|The {{formation}} of fictitious capital is, for Marx, {{linked to the}} wider contradiction between the financial system in capitalism and its monetary basis. Marx writes: [...] "With the development of <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>capital</b> and the credit system, all capital seems to double itself, and sometimes treble itself, by the various modes in which the same capital, or perhaps even the same claim on a debt, appears in different forms in different hands. The greater portion of this 'money-capital' is purely fictitious. All the deposits, {{with the exception of}} the reserve fund, are merely claims on the banker, which, however, never exist as deposits." [...] The expansion of the credit system can, in periods of capitalist expansion, be beneficial for the system; but in periods of economic crisis and uncertainty, capitalists tend, Marx argues, to look to the security of the [...] "money-commodity" [...] (gold) as the ultimate measure of value. Marx tends to assume the convertibility of paper money into gold. However, the modern system of inconvertible paper money, backed by the authority of states, poses greater problems. Here, in periods of crisis, [...] "the capitalist class appears to have a choice between devaluing money or commodities, between inflation or depression. In the event that monetary policy is dedicated to avoiding both, it will merely end up incurring both".|$|E
40|$|Folk finance has {{experienced}} {{a long history of}} development in China, and the state has gradually standardized its policy from the initial suppression. Folk finance {{plays an important role in}} promoting economic growth and increasing the main income of small and medium-sized enterprises and farmers. However, it is not fully incorporated into the national financial supervision system, so the folk finance is lack of standardization in the development process in China. Therefore, based on Marx’s theory of <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>capital,</b> with a “runway”incident in Wenzhou as an entry point, this paper reflects the lessons in China’s folk financial development process, accumulates experience in China’s folk financial development process, and learns from the experience in the international folk financial development, in order to guide the healthy development of China’s folk finance...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} {{of the idea of}} fetishism in Marx's work hardly needs to be argued, {{especially in light of the}} famous passage in Capital concerning commodities. However, the extent of Marx's engagement with fetishism has rarely been explored in full. In order to re-examine this question, the paper is divided into two parts. The first sets Marx's discussion in Capital within the context of his lifelong interest in fetishism, from his earliest encounter with the idea in the work of Charles de Brosses (in the early 1840 s), through his religious and economic transformations of the idea, to his late interest in its anthropological dimensions in the Ethnological Notebooks from the early 1880 s. Included in this discussion is the most famous and well-known treatment of commodity fetishism in the first volume of Capital. The second part explores the permutations of fetishism beyond this initial – and what will turn out to be a very preliminary – moment in Capital, focusing on his extension of the term to the whole of capitalism. In the extant section of the third draft of Capital and then in the third volume of that work, Marx first expands the idea of fetishism to include of the many-fold dimensions of capitalism, which ‘stand on their hind legs vis-à-vis the worker and confront him as capital’. Then he begins a process of distillation, gradually working towards the pure essence of M–M', <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>capital.</b> Here he coins a new word, Kapitalfetisch, capital-fetish. Thus, at the heart of capitalism is what may be called the ‘religion of everyday life (diese Religion des Alltagslebens) ’...|$|E
40|$|In {{his general}} {{analysis}} {{of the evolution of}} capitalism, Marx had posited that industrial capital would subjugate (autonomous) financial capital, manifested in the private banking infrastructure, on the grounds that <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>capital</b> derives from the capitalist production process (and is therefore ultimately dependent on it) and further that commercial credit was a secondary function (merely concerned with facilitating circulation) to the value-adding production process (p. 468) (Marx 1971). Yet, shortly after Marx, events appeared to contradict his prediction. The rise of the joint-stock firm, for instance, suggested that (investment) banks had gained decision-making power over the corporate(s) through integration – the Hilferding notion of finance capital (Hilferding 1910; Lenin 1996). Substantial tribute is also, of course, extracted from the economy in the form of interest. I argued, in a previous AHE paper, that financial rentiers are now less integrated, strengthening their position relative to productive capitalists (Mouatt 2005). Hedge funds and private-equity firms that ‘short-sell’ leveraged funds for instance, that are authorised by the decisions of private bankers, are able to manipulate currency and stock prices that can belie the market fundamentals and bamboozle small investors. Redistributive accumulation, asset stripping, and corporate monopolization can then follow any subsequent currency (or share-price) shock. It seems that finance (and those that control it) has triumphed. Yet, there are contemporary signs of systemic weakness. Banks are increasingly exposed to the vagaries of international financial markets and earn a smaller proportion of profit from interest. In addition, firms are now less dependent on the bankers, as a result of retained profits, and are also further developing their own monies, payment systems and banks. This financial innovation, with new circulation channels, requires a re-think on (modern) money. ...|$|E

In the field of concrete thought, this research has shown that the market and the state are not safe spaces for the realization of health and for the financing of universal public health system...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{contributions}} of Karl Marx (1864 - 1875) and Rudolph Hilferding (1810) to corporate finance. Firstly we present Marx’s analysis {{of the division of}} gross profit of joint-stock companies into management fees, interest on borrowed capital, and profit of enterprise. Among the capital assets, Marx places more emphasis on debt contracts whose yields are fixed and develops a monetary analysis of the determination of these yields. Secondly we present Hilferding’s theory of promoter’s profit. This author resumes Marx’s theory but put the emphasis on the securities (shares) of joint-stock companies whose yields, the dividends, are uncertain, and risky. Hilferding introduces the risk premium in the interest rate used to capitalize the profit of enterprise, which gives rise to the promoter’s profit. Promoter’s profit arises from the conversion of profit-bearing capital into dividend-bearing capital. Our topic is not a general study of Marx’s and Hilferding’s writings on value, money, capital, cycle and connections between industrial and banking capital – cf. J. Schumpeter (1954), S. de Brunhoff (1971, 1973), W. A. Darity & B. L. Horn (1985), C. M. Germer (1998), A. Nelson (1999); J. de Boyer (2003), S. Hollander (2008), J. E. King (2010). In particular we do not inquire the continuity or discontinuity between Marx and Hilferding about the determinants of the value of money and of prices of commodities. We restrict our study to the characteristics of joint-stock companies and to the determinants of interest rates, rate of profit on own capital and market valorisation of this capital. On this limited topic, as far as we know, there are relatively few studies in the secondary literature: A. A. Bolbol & M. A. Lovewell (2001), de Boyer, and Hollander already quoted. Following the introduction, section 2 introduces the profit of enterprise and presents the interactions established by Marx between the forces of supply of, and demand for, <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>capital</b> and the distinct motives of the demand for money; i. e. demand for money as a means of purchase, as a means of payment, international and national, or as a means of hoarding. It leads {{to take into account the}} functioning of the money market and to conclude that the “bank rate” policy of the central bank is the key determinant of the interest rates established on the market for interest bearing capital. Section 3 is devoted to Marx’s criticism of both currency and banking schools concerning this “bank rate” policy. Section 4 introduces the analysis of the leverage effect of borrowed capital on the profitability, and riskiness, on own capital as well as, according to Marx, the separation of ownership from management that results from the creation of joint stock companies. Section 5 focuses the equity risk premium and promoter’s profit introduced by Hilferding. Section 6 discusses Hilferding’s results (1910) in the light of Modigliani-Miller theorem (1958) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} between 1965 and 1973 of {{a crisis}} of over-accumulation and over-capacity, rooted in international manufacturing yet affecting the overall private business economies of the advanced capitalist countries, inaugurated a developmental context whose profound contradictions were brought home by the Great Recession of 2008 - 9 and the continuing Long Depression. The intervening period has seen profound economic, political and social crisis in the advanced capitalist world and has simultaneously been treacherous for under-developed economies forced to navigate rocketing energy costs and international commodity price and currency exchange rate turbulence under the continual threat of debt-levered expropriation. The struggle to locate the causes – proximate and ultimate – of the present crisis {{is at the same}} time a battle to map the basic economic and political coordinates of the continuing long downturn. In this connection it is contended that efforts have been undermined by the epistemological underdevelopment conditioned by a crisis of knowledge-formation which has unfolded in parallel with the long downturn. The dominance of neoclassical economics (‘unworldly’ since the marginal revolution) on the right and the displacement of Marxism on a structurally weakened and autodidactic left in the context of the ascent of postmodernism as an intellectual and cultural dominant has opened a space between the material and discursive realities of global capitalist development. This work is an attempt to deploy the method developed by the classical Marxist tradition to approach the significance of the state and law in the historically-conditioned reproduction of capitalist social relations. It is contended in the first place that the dualism which obtains between national and global spheres in much theorisation of neoliberal ‘globalisation’ obscures the dialectical interrerelation of state and world market – the institutional and regulatory environment of international trade, money and finance being both the creation of states and the developing context which frames their – necessarily path-dependent and reflexive – projects of domestic economy making. As against popular notions of state decline, following Gowan the state-political content of the centring of private financial markets in the mediation of international monetary relations is recalled, while the embeddedness of the state in circuits of capital accumulation is emphasised (Tony Smith), the concept of ‘regime of accumulation’ being deployed to capture the nexus of monetary, fiscal and regulatory policy which articulates historically-conditioned development strategies. In this respect, we depart from the work of the Bolshevik jurist Pashukanis, who despite significantly advancing the materialist analysis of the juridical form, identified in his most significant work a largely derivative role for the state. It is argued that the methodological weakness represented by Pashukanis’ disproportionate emphasis on commodity exchange – his failure to proceed from the basis of the capitalist economy as a contradictory unity of production and circulation – prevents him from fully apprehending the role of the state in the production and reproduction of capitalist social relations. As the discussion unfolds, there is developed in conversation principally with Gramsci an understanding of the state as the specific material condensation of a relationship of forces among classes and class fractions. Upholding the notion of the ‘integral state’ as a differentiated unity of civil society and political society upon which terrains the capitalist class forms alliances with proximate classes as the prerequisite for and correlate of its domination of labour, the developmental context represented by neoliberalism is conceived in terms of the transition of <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>capital</b> from leading to dominant fraction of the capitalist class in parallel with its tendential contradictory disaggregation from productive capital. Such a process has necessitated a transformation in the character of bourgeois political supremacy involving a dismantling of the civil rights and social protections accumulated during the period bookended by Americanism and the welfare state and increasing dependence upon an expanded machinery of coercion. Proceeding from this basis, it is considered how in specific developmental contexts the state by way of the legal form maps the social totality, achieving distinctive couplings (and de-couplings) of wealth production and social reproduction. There is asserted the second-order integration of public and private spheres in terms of the fundamental unity of capitalist reproduction, the first-order public/private metabolism being evaluated in view of the facilitation and rationalisation of social reproduction in the context of a productive economy structured around dissociated private producers. The legal form is further interrogated in view of its role in structuring the productive antagonism between capital and labour, a relation which on the basis of its form comes to expresses various contents – from consensual integration to casuistic assimilation – as domestic social relations are (in-) validated by the operation of the law of value at the level of the world market. In this connection, the unproductive theoretical polarisation obtaining between approaches which consider law to be epiphenomenal and those which pursue its relative autonomy is enriched by a historicised conception in terms of which law, concretising specific relationships of forces within particular regimes of accumulation, appears as ‘sword’, as ‘shield’ and as ‘fetter’. This framework is particularly useful for evaluating the opportunities for the deployment of legal strategies by labour and groups oppressed under capitalism – a question in relation to which Pashukanis, following Lenin, demonstrated a remarkable political astuteness. </p...|$|E
