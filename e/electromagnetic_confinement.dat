40|$|AbstractDue to {{the cost}} advantage, weld-based Additive Manufacturing (AM) is {{suitable}} for directly fabricating large metallic parts. One of challenges for weld-based Additive M anufacturing is to build overhanging structure or tilt structure at a large slant angle, because liquid metal on the boundary would flow down by gravity {{due to lack of}} sufficient support. In the present work, electromagnetically confined weld-based Additive Manufacturing is develop ed to solve this problem. In the process, liquid metal is confined and semi-levitated by the Lorentz force exerted by magnetic field and thus the flow of liquid metal is restricted. Experiments and numerical simulations are performed to investigate the effect mechanism of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>confinement.</b> Experimental results verify that the flow-down or collapse of liquid metal is impeded by <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>confinement.</b> With specific welding parameters, the maximum tilt angle of successful building increases from 50 ° to 60 ° when imposing <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>confinement...</b>|$|E
