5|$|Progress {{remained}} slow through 1991 and 1992. A cabinet {{set up in}} October 1991 contained {{almost no}} opposition at all, and the administrative hierarchy across the country only recognised the authority of Habyarimana's MRND party. The regime frequently used violence {{as a tool to}} <b>hamper</b> reform, justifying its actions as anti-RPF security measures.|$|E
5|$|According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, sound biofuel {{production}} practices would not <b>hamper</b> food and fibre production, nor cause water or environmental problems, and would enhance soil fertility. The selection of {{land on which}} to grow the feedstocks is {{a critical component of}} the ability of biofuels to deliver sustainable solutions. A key consideration is the minimisation of biofuel competition for prime cropland.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} factors, the revolt was often considered to either be a {{manipulation of the}} commoners by a reactionary elite against modernization, a successful Ottoman bid to <b>hamper</b> Egypt's efforts to liberate and unify its Arab lands, or was sidelined. The concept that the revolt's diverse participants were acting {{based on their own}} interests and actual grievances rather than manipulation was largely ignored in Palestinian historiography until recent decades.|$|E

5|$|German forces {{began to}} probe the 1st Airlanding Brigade defences {{throughout}} the morning. Units of Kampfgruppe Von Tettau attacked the Border's positions; men of the SS NCO school overran Renkum and Kriegsmarine troops engaged the British all day as they withdrew. Small amounts of fighting broke out around LZ 'X' {{but not enough to}} seriously <b>hamper</b> the glider landing there. At DZ 'Y', the Dutch SS Wach Battalion became heavily engaged with the King's Own Scottish Borderers, threatening to <b>hamper</b> the arrival of the second lift. The communications breakdown meant {{that it was impossible to}} warn the aircraft. Equally, there was no way for the division to know that the 2nd lift had been delayed by ground fog in England. Thus, the arrival of the 4th Parachute Brigade under Brigadier Hackett and several more troops of artillery at the drop zones was several hours overdue. When the parachutists did arrive after 15:00, they dropped under fire. Several were killed as aircraft and parachutists were shot down and the heath-land they were landing on caught fire. Nevertheless, the arrival of a full brigade overwhelmed the Dutch who were routed and surrendered in droves.|$|E
5|$|Henry Dubar (who {{had helped}} recruit Doe {{personally}} years before) was promoted in one leap from captain to lieutenant general as Chief of Staff.

5|$|The year {{preceding}} 1945 {{had been}} catastrophic for the ZNDH.

50|$|<b>Hampers</b> {{went on to}} insinuate that a {{nighttime}} break-in at her office (where some sensitive records had been stolen, but none connected to the investigation) had been ordered by his chief prosecutor Stephen Delinsky. She {{accused him of being}} motivated in his actions out of favoring Dukakis' campaign. In response to <b>Hampers</b> unfounded accusations, Governor King ordered her to stop making public statements. Delinsky charged that <b>Hampers</b> had tried to use state police to confiscate sensitive records held by Barczak (only prevented from doing so by the intervention of state troopers guarding him). <b>Hampers</b> responded saying she had only sent them to collect Barczak's revenue department credentials. Delinsky told reporters he would have the grand jury consider whether the incident was obstruction of justice and intimidation of a witness.|$|R
5|$|World {{demand for}} {{palladium}} increased from 100 tons in 1990 to nearly 300tons in 2000. The global production of palladium from mines was 222tonnes in 2006 {{according to the}} United States Geological Survey. Many are concerned about {{a steady supply of}} palladium in the wake of Russia's military maneuvers in Ukraine, partly as sanctions could <b>hamper</b> Russian palladium exports; any restrictions on Russian palladium exports would exacerbate what is already expected to be a large palladium deficit in 2014.|$|E
5|$|An {{economic}} downturn was beginning in Canada by 1958. Because {{of tax cuts}} instituted the previous year, the budget presented by the government predicted a small deficit for 1957–58, and a large one, $648million, for the following year. Minister of Finance Fleming and Bank of Canada Governor James Coyne proposed that the wartime Victory Bond issue, which constituted two-thirds of the national debt and which was due to be redeemed by 1967, be refinanced to a longer term. After considerable indecision on Diefenbaker's part, a nationwide campaign took place, and 90% of the bonds were converted. However, this transaction led {{to an increase in}} the money supply, which in future years would <b>hamper</b> the government's efforts to respond to unemployment.|$|E
5|$|As allied {{intentions}} became clear, General Pigot {{decided to}} redeploy his {{forces in a}} defensive posture, withdrawing troops from Conanicut Island and from Butts Hill. He also decided to move nearly all livestock into the city, ordered the levelling of orchards to provide a clear line of fire, and destroyed carriages and wagons. The arriving French ships drove several of his supporting ships aground, which were then burned to prevent their capture. As the French worked {{their way up the}} channel toward Newport, Pigot ordered the remaining ships scuttled to <b>hamper</b> French access to Newport's harbour. On 8 August d'Estaing moved the bulk of his fleet into Newport Harbour.|$|E

5|$|By August31, {{the storm}} began to slow and turn towards the west-northwest. The NHC {{noted that they}} did not have a firm grip on the storm and were unsure of its future track and intensity. Below average sea surface {{temperatures}} ahead of the system would <b>hamper</b> significant development. Continuing on this track, Christine gradually intensified and on September2, the storm attained its peak intensity just below hurricane-status while situated roughly 300mi (500km) east of Guadeloupe. At this time, a reconnaissance aircraft recorded sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a minimum pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg). Shortly after Christine attained this intensity, increasing wind shear caused the storm to weaken as it neared the Leeward Islands.|$|E
5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to improve the {{situation}} and <b>hamper</b> British operations, a number of experienced night fighter commanders and pilots suggested restarting intruder operations over England. In 1940–41, German night fighters, lacking airborne radar sets and a means to locate them over Germany, had flown to British bomber bases and attempted to destroy RAF bombers as they returned from their missions. Adolf Hitler had ordered a cessation of these activities for propaganda and practical reasons but these operations had met with reasonable success in 1941 and it was felt they may do so again.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{forensic}} fields, forensic anthropologists {{are held}} to {{a high level of}} ethical standards due to their work in the legal system. Individuals who purposefully misrepresent themselves or any piece of evidence can be sanctioned, fined, or imprisoned by the appropriate authorities depending on the severity of the violation. Individuals who fail to disclose any conflict of interests or who fail to report all of their findings, regardless of what they may be, can face disciplinary actions. It is important that forensic anthropologists remain impartial during the course of an investigation. Any perceived bias during an investigation could <b>hamper</b> efforts in court to bring the responsible parties to justice.|$|E

5|$|Like {{some other}} British {{football}} {{stars of the}} late 20th century, Baxter drank to excess, {{and at one point}} was said to be consuming three bottles of Bacardi a day. Scotland teammate Dave Mackay unsuccessfully advised him to train harder and live more sensibly. Baxter often got falling-down drunk the night before a match, but this did not seem to <b>hamper</b> his play, and team managers took little notice of his drinking. After retiring from football Baxter became a pub licensee, an unsuitable career for a problem drinker. At the age of 55 he needed two liver transplants in four days, and promised to quit drinking.|$|E
5|$|On January 28, 2017, amid protests at Sea-Tac Airport {{against the}} signing of an {{executive}} order from President Donald Trump, the station was shut down by Sound Transit {{at the request of}} Port of Seattle security. The 30-minute shutdown was criticized by the media and King County Executive Dow Constantine as an attempt to <b>hamper</b> protesters' freedom of speech and right to free assembly. Service was resumed at the direction of Sound Transit CEO Peter Rogoff, and the following week Sound Transit and King County Metro formalized a new protocol requiring future requests from law enforcement to suspend service be approved by the CEO or general manager.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the {{original}} doctrine of privity {{say that it is}} reasonable not to allow third parties to enforce contracts, arguing that to allow them to do so would <b>hamper</b> the rights of {{the original}} parties in relation to amending or terminating contracts. Another argument put forward is that the doctrine was deliberately retained by judges to protect consumers from exclusion clauses designed to protect third party manufacturers from liability. The general view of academics, however, is that no legal argument has yet been advanced as to why the original doctrine should be good law. Patrick Atiyah argues that the doctrine came from a time of rising trade through middlemen, and was designed to simplify commercial transactions and encourage enterprise liability.|$|E
