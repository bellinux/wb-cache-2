25|$|Nitrate, {{which is}} found mostly in {{drinking}} water from ground sources, is a powerful teratogen. A case-control study in rural Australia that was conducted following frequent reports of prenatal mortality and congenital malformations <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> drank the nitrate-infected groundwater, as opposed to rain water, ran the risk of giving birth to children with central nervous system disorders, muscoskeletal defects, and cardiac defects.|$|E
25|$|A recent Finnish {{study of}} more than 5,000 {{hospital}} staff <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had been bullied had 26% more certified sickness absence than those who were not bullied, when figures were adjusted for base-line measures one year prior to the survey (Kivimaki et al., 2000). According to the researchers these figures are probably an underestimation as many of the targets are likely to have been bullied already at the time the base-line measures were obtained.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the mentioned health risks (like unwanted pregnancies and infection transmissions), other risks {{have been associated with}} early sexual activity. For example, a recent study (2017) <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> start having sex at an earlier age have higher risks of: not using a condom; not having good memories of that first experience; and having had that relationship for non-autonomous reasons (such as partner pressure, peer pressure or the influence of substance use). This article also summarizes other risks (found in previous studies) associated with earlier sex: having an increased number of sexual partners or of casual sexual partners; perpetrating or being a victim of forced sex; engaging in paid sex; depression and behavior problems.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Army has {{deployed}} machines {{such as the}} PackBot and UAV vehicles, {{which make}} use of a game-style hand controller {{to make it more}} familiar for young people. According to research discussed at the 2008 Convention of the American Psychological Association, certain types of video games can improve the gamers' dexterity as well as their ability to do problem solving. A study of 33 laparoscopic surgeons <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> played video games were 27 percent faster at advanced surgical procedures and made 37 percent fewer errors compared to those who did not play video games. A second study of 303 laparoscopic surgeons (82 percent men; 18 percent women) also showed that surgeons who played video games requiring spatial skills and hand dexterity and then performed a drill testing these skills were significantly faster at their first attempt and across all 10 trials than the surgeons who did not play the video games first.|$|E
25|$|High {{rates of}} major {{depressive}} disorder occur in heavy drinkers and those who abuse alcohol. Whether it is more true that {{major depressive disorder}} causes self-medicating alcohol abuse, or the increased incidence of the disorder in alcohol abusers {{is caused by the}} drinking, is not known though some evidence suggests drinking causes the disorder. Alcohol misuse is associated with a number of mental health disorders and alcoholics have a very high suicide rate. A study of people hospitalised for suicide attempts <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> were alcoholics were 75 times more likely to go on to successfully commit suicide than non-alcoholic suicide attempters. In the general alcoholic population the increased risk of suicide compared to the general public is 5-20 times greater. About 15 percent of alcoholics commit suicide. Abuse of other drugs is also associated with an increased risk of suicide. About 33 percent of suicides in the under 35s are due to alcohol or other substance misuse.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the growth}} of {{multilingualism}} {{in different parts of}} the world, there are controversies on the positive and negative impacts of bilingualism on the education of children. Studies have brought part of the answer to frequent questions such as: are bilingual children distressed? Does multilingualism make children smarter? Defenders of multilingualism assert that speaking another language contributes to an intelligent and healthy brain whereas opponents of multilingualism vehemently insist that speaking another language does not make children smarter and that on the contrary, it can disturb their learning journey. Researcher Ellen Bialystok examined the effect of multilingualism on Alzheimer's disease and found that it delays its onset by about 4 years. The researcher's study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> spoke two or more languages showed symptoms of Alzheimer's disease at a later time than speakers of a single language. Interestingly, the study found that the more languages the multilingual knows, the later the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Multilingualism aids in the building up of cognitive reserves in the brain; these cognitive reserves force the brain to work harder—they, themselves, restructure the brain. Multilingualism leads to greater efficiency of use in the brain, and organizes the brain to be more efficient and conservative in using energy. More research is required to determine whether learning another language later in life has the same protective effects; nonetheless, it is evident from the variety of studies performed on the effects of multilingualism and bilingualism on the brain, that learning and knowing multiple languages sets the stage for a cognitive healthy life.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of police patrol and crime education on the fear of crime and security-conscious behavior of 152 senior citizens. It was <b>found</b> <b>that,</b> for {{the group as a}} whole, communication with officers on patrol was significantly associated with lower levels of fear and security consciousness. More interestingly, however, it was <b>found</b> <b>that,</b> although <b>those</b> <b>who</b> were highly affected by the crime education component exhibited increased security-conscious behavior, they also showed increased fear. Reasons for this latter finding are explored using the concept of vicarious victimization...|$|R
500|$|The Museum of Bad Art {{has been}} used in {{academic}} studies as a standard of reference for the spectacularly awful. In one such study, published in Perspectives on Psychological Science, researchers tested the consistency of responses between people asked to make [...] "gut" [...] judgments versus those who gave conscious well-reasoned responses regarding the quality of various pieces of art. [...] The researchers showed respondents images from MOBA and New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), and asked them to rate each painting on a scale with two ends representing [...] "Very Attractive" [...] and [...] "Very Unattractive". The study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> reasoned in conscious thought were neither more accurate nor as consistent in their ratings. Study participants identified and rated MoMA art higher quality, but those who used conscious reasoning did not find MoMA art more attractive than those who rated with [...] "gut" [...] judgments. Furthermore, the deliberators did not find MOBA art as unattractive as those with quicker response times. The study concluded that people who make quick judgments do so more consistently, with no significant change to accuracy.|$|E

2500|$|There {{is limited}} {{research}} on the consequences of adoption for the original parents, and the findings have been mixed. One study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> released their babies for adoption were less comfortable with their decision than those who kept their babies. However, levels of comfort over both groups were high, and those who released their child {{were similar to those}} who kept their child in ratings of life satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, and positive future outlook for schooling, employment, finances, and marriage. [...] Subsequent research found that adolescent mothers who chose to release their babies for adoption were more likely to experience feelings of sorrow and regret over their decision than those who kept their babies. However, these feelings decreased significantly from one year after birth {{to the end of the}} second year.|$|E

Even <b>those</b> <b>that</b> did frequent the library often said that they were too embarrassed to ask for help; many expected shocked reactions or outright homophobia from librarians. Some common complaints about library collections from <b>those</b> <b>who</b> did use them were that information was negative, outdated or difficult to find. Whitt concluded that more staff training was needed to address these perceptions.

2500|$|Infidelities at work {{or office}} romances are thought to stem at an individual's workplace. As {{the sheer number of}} women in the {{workforce}} is now matching the same numbers of men, researchers expect that as workplace interaction between the sexes increases, the likelihood of infidelity will also increase (Kuroki, 2010). [...] Wiggins and Lederer (1984) found that opportunities to engage in infidelity were related to the workplace where nearly one half of their samples who engaged in infidelity were involved with coworkers. A study done by McKinnish (2007) <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> work with a larger fraction of workers of the opposite sex {{are more likely to be}} divorced due to infidelity. Kuroki found married women were less likely to have a workplace affair whereas individuals who are self-employed are more likely to have had an extramarital affair. In 2000 Treas and Giesen found similar results where sexual opportunities in the workplace increased the likelihood of infidelity during the last 12 months.|$|E
2500|$|Neurological {{disorders}} are {{diseases of the}} brain, spine and the nerves that connect them. The new {{study of more than}} 700 people in California’s Central Valley <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> likely consumed contaminated private well water had a higher rate of Parkinson’s. The risk was 90 percent higher for those who had private wells near fields sprayed with widely used insecticides. Unlike water supplies in large cities, private wells are mostly unregulated and are not monitored for contaminants. Many of them exist at shallow depths of less than 20 yards, and some of the crop chemicals used to kill pests and weeds can flow into ground water. Therefore, private wells are likely to contain pesticides, which can attack developing brains (womb or infancy), leading to neurological diseases later in life. A study led by UCLA epidemiology professor Beate Ritz suggests that [...] "people with Parkinson’s {{were more likely to have}} consumed private well water, and had consumed it on average 4.3 years longer than those who did not have the disease." ...|$|E

Stern, unyielding, dogged, and impenetrable, Ralph {{cared for}} nothing in life, or beyond it, save the {{gratification}} of two passions, avarice, the first and predominant appetite of his nature, and hatred, the second. Affecting to consider himself but a type of all humanity, he was at little pains to conceal his true character from the world in general, and in his own heart he exulted over and cherished every bad design as it had birth. The only scriptural admonition that Ralph Nickleby heeded, in the letter, was 'know thyself.' He knew himself well, and choosing to imagine that all mankind were cast in the same mould, hated them; for, though no man hates himself, the coldest among us having too much self-love for that, yet most men unconsciously judge the world from themselves, and it will be very generally <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> sneer habitually at human nature, and affect to despise it, are among its worst and least pleasant samples.|$|E

Recent evidence, however, suggests that individuals in organisations are increasingly being encouraged to report wrongdoings, with whistle-blowing being highlighted as an effective method of reducing the costs of fraudulent activities. This single organisation case study finds that many employees are still reluctant to report wrongdoings in their workplace. This is particularly the case in respect of male employees.
