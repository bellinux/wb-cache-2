5|$|<b>In</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> {{compete at}} the Winter Olympics, he set up the Ethiopian National Skiing Federation with his three {{brothers}} so that the sport could be recognised in the country. Teklemariam explained in interviews prior to the Games that he hoped his appearance would inspire other Ethiopians living in colder climates to take up sports. He suggested that cross-country skiing could be a sport that Ethiopians could naturally be proficient at, since it was an endurance sport.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> {{discipline}} the nuns, the Vatican did not contact {{any one of}} them personally, and did {{not respond}} to direct individual communication. Rather, the superiors of the nuns were asked to write letters verifying whether or not the nuns were in line with Catholic teaching on abortion, and a variety of responses were received from the superiors. A few nuns disavowed their position on abortion and the cases were quickly closed. Most nuns held to their earlier conviction, although their superiors sent letters saying that they accepted Church teaching. Once a nun's superior had {{sent a letter to the}} Vatican, the case was closed, without any further attempt to prevent the nun from speaking out on the issues.|$|E

25|$|Surveyor General Sir Thomas Mitchell {{conducted}} {{a series of}} expeditions from the 1830s to 'fill in the gaps' left by these previous expeditions. He was meticulous <b>in</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> record the original Aboriginal place names around the colony, for which reason the majority of place names to this day retain their Aboriginal titles.|$|E
25|$|The Tenant of Wildfell Hall {{is perhaps}} amongst the most {{shocking}} of contemporary Victorian novels. <b>In</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> present the truth in literature, Anne's depiction of alcoholism and debauchery was profoundly disturbing to 19th-century sensibilities. Helen Graham, the tenant of the title, intrigues Gilbert Markham and gradually she reveals her past {{as an artist and}} wife of the dissipated Arthur Huntingdon. The book's brilliance lies in its revelation of the position of women at the time, and its multi-layered plot.|$|E

The tribe claimed the lobbyists had hidden their motives in representing the competing Coushatta of Louisiana, which ran their own casino, and mobilized Christian groups in an underhanded way. A Senate investigation in 2006 revealed that several tribes were defrauded of {{tens of millions of dollars}} by Abramoff and associates on issues associated with Indian gaming.|$|E

Along with pursuing a free trade agreement, India wants to promote investment in various sectors of Panama's economy, including the banking and maritime industry and the multimodal centre of the Colón Free Trade Zone.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> {{solve some}} of the {{administrative}} incoherence in the pre-war British ruled Malaya, a policy of constitutional development which incorporated the twin goals of constitutional unity and a common citizenship within Malaya was developed {{as the basis for}} eventual self-rule and independence of the territory. The first proposal called for the Federated Malay States and Unfederated Malay States to be joined into a larger federation styled the Malayan Union. It was expected that Penang and Malacca would be severed from the Straits Settlements to join the new federation while Singapore remained a separate Crown Colony.|$|E

25|$|The ABB became highly {{critical}} of Garvey following the apparent failure of the Black Star Line and Garvey's July 1921 Atlanta meeting with Grand Kleagle Clarke of the Ku Klux Klan. In June 1922, The Crusader announced that it had become the official organ of the African Blood Brotherhood. Arguing that the UNIA was doomed unless it developed new leadership, the magazine sought to convert the UNIA's membership to the ABB. <b>In</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> replace the UNIA, the ABB competed with Randolph's socialist publication The Messenger, which had called for Garvey's expulsion from the United States. In return, Garvey called for his followers to disrupt meetings of these oppositional groups.|$|E
25|$|The Kremlin in the Putin era {{has often}} sought to {{maintain}} as much sway over {{the portrayal of}} history as over the governance of the country. <b>In</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> restore Russia's standing, Putin and other officials have stoked a nationalism that glorifies Soviet triumphs while playing down or even whitewashing the system's horrors. As a result, throughout Russia, many archives detailing killings, persecution and other such acts committed by the Soviet authorities have become increasingly off-limits. The role of the security services seems especially delicate, perhaps because Putin is a former KGB agent who headed the agency's successor, the FSB, in the late 1990s.|$|E
25|$|These {{measures}} include {{legal provisions}} for the automatic grant of 6 months stay under {{the freedom of}} movement obligations and honouring CARICOM skills certificates in Montserrat (the latter measure the Government of Montserrat had been implemented by way of amendments to existing Statutory Rules and Orders since 1996 in keeping with conformity with the original Conference of Heads of Government decision on the free movement of university graduates). Montserrat also issues land holding licenses to CARICOM nationals as an administrative procedure <b>in</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> comply with CARICOM’s right of establishment obligations, and intends to remove all impediments except for those related to cost recovery. Montserrat's compliance with the movement of capital obligations under the CSME is already assured {{within the framework of the}} East Caribbean Currency Union.|$|E

25|$|On 20 April, Stanley invited Belcher {{to stop by}} his Park Lane apartment. When {{he arrived}} he found Sherman. Belcher left angrily and later rebuked Stanley. Belcher decided to drop the {{prosecution}} against Sherman but the allocation of paper was now under his direct control and Sherman became still more insistent <b>in</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> increase his ration. Stanley continued to intercede on Sherman's behalf and Belcher agreed to meet with Sherman and the civil servant in charge of paper rationing on 24 June. At this meeting, Sherman revealed {{that he had been}} routinely exceeding his allocation.

25|$|The Gender Equality Bureau, <b>in</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> promote gender {{equality}} in Japan, has sought guidance from international bodies {{such as the}} United Nations, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. In 2010, Japan served as chair of APEC, and held the 15th Women Leaders Network meeting in Tokyo. Japan {{was also one of}} the initial executives of UN Women, which was formed in January 2011. The Gender Equality Bureau also works with international non-governmental agencies, such as Polaris Project and ECPAT, to combat issues such as human trafficking and sexual abuse. Some observers have also noted how international studies on gender inequality, such as those conducted annually by the World Economic Forum, have acted as catalysts for movement on the {{gender equality}} front by the Japanese government.|$|E
25|$|As {{the strike}} entered its fourth week, the police cracked down even harder on the Wobblies. The Los Angeles {{headquarters}} of the KKK handed out a pamphlet to local citizens to get more supports and help the police force break up the strike. Members of the Ku Klux Klan, with or without their hoods regularly came to the San Pedro docks to be a force of intimidation. The latter began to look on the dispute as a free-speech fight and continued to hold meetings near the water front at a point known as Liberty Hill, a privately owned parcel of land used {{with the permission of}} the owner. Local sympathizers and members of the American Civil Liberties Union joined the IWW leaders <b>in</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> maintain rights of free speech.

500|$|... "The duplex {{world of}} Werner Heisenberg." [...] Heisenberg {{recognized}} a division {{inherent in the}} Copenhagen interpretation, between the concrete actuality (phenomenon) of observations {{and the range of}} potentiality (...) described by the wave function. <b>In</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> address the ontological nature of the unobserved world, he considered quantum theory to be not merely a successful mathematical analogy, but a literal description of the underlying reality. In Herbert's description of Heisenberg's view, the unobserved world is a world composed of possibility, qualitatively less real than the world of observed fact.|$|E
500|$|According to Diefenbaker biographer Smith, the Conservative MP quietly admired Mackenzie King for his {{political}} skills.
