50|$|Dr. Huang's {{research}} {{has tended to}} focus on the development of <b>general</b> <b>concepts,</b> <b>methodologies,</b> theories, and algorithms which have wide application to multimodal and multimedia signal processing. While still at MIT, he developed the first algebraic procedure for testing the stability conditions of two-dimensional filters, based on double bilinear transformation and the Ansell method. He also published on digital holography. While at Purdue, he worked on nonlinear filters, particularly median filters, which became a standard technique for the removal of noise in images.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{research}} described in this thesis was to develop the <b>general</b> <b>concept</b> and <b>methodology</b> of DNA-based asymmetric catalysis, {{with the aim of}} using this concept to discover novel reactivities, and to develop mechanistic understanding of successful catalysts. The main achievements reported in this thesis are: i) The development of a highly enantioselective DNA-based catalyst for several important C–C bond forming reactions, i. e. the Diels-Alder, Michael, and Friedel-Crafts reaction. ii) The first asymmetric syn-hydration of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, catalyzed by the first generation DNA-based catalysts. iii) Insight into the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the highly enantioselective second-generation catalysts. iv) Insights into the structure of this catalyst. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCoordination {{models and}} {{languages}} {{are introduced to}} effectively rule and govern the interactions in those systems that feature complexity, distribution, opennes and high dynamics. These characteristics, however, traditionally impose a number of constraints on the engineering process: most notably, they make system specifications infinite, thus complicating – and sometimes preventing – the successful automatic verification of properties. In the field of verification for infinite state systems, the notion of well-structured transition systems has recently being introduced and studied. Its framework not only unifies a number of existing results {{in the context of}} infinite verification, but also introduces <b>general</b> <b>concepts</b> and <b>methodologies,</b> such as upward-closure and backward analysis, that show a great potential applicability for concurrent and interactive systems in general. In this paper, we evaluate the applicability of this framework to the context of coordination, formally defining the notion of well-structured coordination. A coordinated system adhering to this notion is amenable to a description in terms of a well-structured transition system, where interesting properties concerning termination, boundedness, safety, and liveness are decidable. An example of application to the Linda coordination model is studied, focussing on a methodology for proving the safety properties of coordinated systems...|$|R
40|$|Proteomics is a {{relatively}} new scientific discipline that merges protein biochemistry, genome biology and bioinformatics to determine the spatial and temporal expression of proteins in cells, tissues and whole organisms. There has been very little application of proteomics to the fields of behavioral genetics, evolution, ecology and population dynamics, and has only recently been effectively applied to the closely allied fields of molecular evolution and genetics. However, there exists considerable potential for proteomics to impact in areas related to functional ecology; this review will introduce the <b>general</b> <b>concepts</b> and <b>methodologies</b> that define the field of proteomics and compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages with other methods. Examples of how proteomics can aid, complement and indeed extend the study of functional ecology will be discussed including the main tool of ecological studies, population genetics with an emphasis on metapopulation structure analysis. Because proteomic analyses provide a direct measure of gene expression, it obviates some of the limitations associated with other genomic approaches, such as microarray and EST analyses. Likewise, in conjunction with associated bioinformatics and molecular evolutionary tools, proteomics can provide the foundation of a systems-level integration approach that can enhance ecological studies. It can be envisioned that proteomics will provide important new information on issues specific to metapopulation biology and adaptive processes in nature. A specific example of the application of proteomics to sperm ageing is provided to illustrate the potential utility of the approach...|$|R
