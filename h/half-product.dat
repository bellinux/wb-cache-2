50|$|In May 1961 the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers {{approved}} “the {{basic principles}} of development of the Nitric Plants in Tarnów”, that is {{the transformation of the}} enterprise into large chemical complex. The further development of the plants and intensification of the contemporary production range in the existing installations was planned for the sum of 4.8 million contemporary Polish zloty. The program for plant development was named “Tarnów II”. It included the construction of three installation for acetylene production in the process of semi-combustion with the oxygen generating plant and new installation for ammonia synthesis (3 units, 200 tons per day each), new chlorine generating plant with mercury method with capacity of 30 thousand tons per year, development of chlorine and polyvinylidene dichloride generating plants, using acetylene, with capacity of 80 thousand tons per year, the hydrogen cyanide and acrylonitrile generating plants (<b>half-product</b> for wool-like fibre) as well as the construction of plant generating semiconducting silicon. In the scope of the program the further development of the production capabilities of caprolactam with the installations for producing half-products: sulphuric acid and oleum, ammonium nitrate, hydroxylamine sulphate and ammonium sulphate processed as side effect at caproplactam production.|$|E
50|$|The {{concentration}} of {{efforts in the}} 50’s of XX c. {{on the development of}} fertilising track did not mean one-sided modernisation of the factory. In that period, the preparations for further development were started, aiming to broaden the range of products and implement modern and highly refined products. In 1952-1953 the installation for methanol synthesis was built and launched on the basis of experiences from the half-technological installation existing in the Research Laboratory since 1934. The produced methanol was the material for formalin and methenamine in the newly constructed and launched installations in that period. In 1953 the first organic product was started to produce on the technological scale - formalin, with capability of 4500 tons per year. Both ammonia intensification as well as the formalin installation were the investments designed and performed independently. The next milestone to change in the productive profile of the company was the start of the construction of the installation of the caprolactam, a <b>half-product</b> to polyamide fibre and plastic production. Year 1957, the anniversary and thirtieth year in the history of “Mościce” was called “the year of great launches”. In addition to the launch of the caprolactam plant, a new mercury salt electrolysis with capacity of 18000 tons per year was commissioned. The intensification of production and construction of new installations caused the increase in demand of the plants for steam and electric power, which could not be obtained by the intensification of the existing heat and power plant (EC I). The decision on construction of a new heat and power plant with capacity of 50 MW with possibility of further development was made. The new heat and power plan (so-called EC II) was built in years 1954-1958. The first stage of the EC II construction was the installation of three steam boilers and two bleeding-condensing turbines.|$|E

A fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for PHP is derived. Several NP-hard scheduling problems can be formulated in terms of PHP. In this presentation, we concentrate on a single machine scheduling problem with controllable job processing times to minimize a linear combination of the total weighted job completion time and the total weighted processing time compression. 1. Problems HP (<b>half-product)</b> and PHP (positive <b>half-product)</b> Denote () n x x x,, 1 K =.

There is an equivalence between problem HP and some scheduling problems {{in a sense that}} their exact solutions coincide. However, e-approximate solution to problem HP is not an e- approximate solution to a scheduling problem in most of the cases.

40|$|We {{consider}} Boolean programming {{problems with}} quadratic objective functions, {{related to the}} <b>Half-Product</b> introduced by Badics and Boros in 1998. The variants include problems of minimizing the <b>Half-Product</b> with an additive constant, convex positive <b>Half-Product,</b> a symmetric quadratic function, with and without a linear knapsack constraint. A methodology for designing fully polynomial-time approximation schemes (FPTASs) for these problems is presented. As one of the prerequisites for designing an FPTAS, the problem at hand must admit a constant-ratio approximation algorithm. We develop such algorithms by solving the continuous relaxation of a Boolean programming problem in strongly polynomial time followed by an appropriate rounding of the fractional variables. The problems under consideration serve as mathematical programming reformulations {{of a wide range}} of scheduling problems with mini-sum objective functions. The corresponding FPTASs can be adapted to be applicable to these scheduling problems...|$|E
40|$|A {{class of}} codes, <b>half-product</b> codes, derived from product codes, is characterized. These codes have the {{implementation}} advantages of product codes and possess a special structural property which {{leads them to}} have larger (at least 3 / 2 times more) minimum distance than product codes. With the same length and rate, they have better scaling in the error floor than product codes. They also have a larger minimum stopping-set size under iterative decoding which provides better scaling. The main results of this thesis are summarized as follows: 1. Encoding and decoding methods of <b>half-product</b> codes are described. 2. The minimum distance of these codes is derived, and proved {{to be at least}} 3 2 times larger than that of the product codes for the same rate and block length. 3. The performance of iterative decoding in the error floor region is analyzed by enumerating the minimum stopping-set patterns for these codes. The results are compared with product codes. Simulations are also performed to compare the <b>half-product</b> codes with product codes. We conclude that <b>half-product</b> codes scale better in the error floor than product codes in the region where the minimum stopping-sets dominate the error floor, and that they have same threshold as product codes when rate is same and code length is increased to infinity...|$|E

40|$|Generalized product codes (GPCs) are {{extensions}} of product codes (PCs) where coded bits {{are protected by}} two component codes but not necessarily arranged in a rectangular array. It has recently been shown that there exists a large class of deterministic GPCs (including, e. g., irregular PCs, <b>half-product</b> codes, staircase codes, and certain braided codes) for which the asymptotic performance under iterative bounded-distance decoding over the binary erasure channel (BEC) can be rigorously characterized {{in terms of a}} density evolution analysis. In this paper, the analysis is extended to the case where transmission takes place over parallel BECs with different erasure probabilities. We use this model to predict the code performance in a coded modulation setup with higher-order signal constellations. We also discuss the design of the bit mapper that determines the allocation of the coded bits to the modulation bits of the signal constellation.

40|$|Product codes (PCs) {{protect a}} {{two-dimensional}} array of bits using short component codes. Assuming transmission over the binary symmetric channel, the decoding is commonly performed by iteratively applying bounded-distance decoding to the component codes. For this coding scheme, undetected {{errors in the}} component decoding-also known as miscorrections-significantly degrade the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative decoding algorithm for PCs which can detect and avoid most miscorrections. The algorithm {{can also be used}} to decode many recently proposed classes of generalized PCs such as staircase, braided, and <b>half-product</b> codes. Depending on the component code parameters, our algorithm significantly outperforms the conventional iterative decoding method. As an example, for double-error-correcting Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem component codes, the net coding gain can be increased by up to 0. 4 dB. Moreover, the error floor can be lowered by orders of magnitude, up to the point where the decoder performs virtually identical to a genie-aided decoder that avoids all miscorrections. We also discuss post-processing techniques that can be used to reduce the error floor even further.

40|$|AbstractAt the {{roughing}} of the helical {{flanks of}} the worms with frontal-cylindrical milling tools positioned {{perpendicular to the}} axis of symmetry of the <b>half-product</b> we can use tools of different diameters, with the mill position being different in each case. In this article the milling position is determined {{on the basis of}} the contact between the toroid surface of frontal-cylindrical milling tool and a helical surface, so that it remains the desired addition of processing. Determination of contact between the toroid part of frontal-cylindrical milling tool and the helical surface is done using coordinate transformations. The points thus obtained shall be brought in the axial plane, compared with the points belonging to the desired profile to obtain and determine the location of a mill at each crossing. The milling position at each crossing shall be determined by means of a program that compares the curve of contact between the helical surfaces brought into the axial plane of the worm with a straight line inclined with the angle of pressure of the studied worm located in the axial plane. For the cutting depth considered, the difference between coordinated on the OX of the curve and of the line, represents the movement of the tool along the axis of symmetry in the sense indicated by the sign of the difference.

Drinking water meeting these requirements is responsible for less than one infection in 10, 000 persons per year. In 2001 the occurrence of noro- and rotaviruses in both the source and the water produced by WBB was studied, whereas the number of culturable reo- and enteroviruses in these waters was determined. Campylobacter numbers were determined in the produced water. The source water contained culturable reo- and enteroviruses in concentrations of 0. 01 to 1 virus particle per litre. The water produced also contained culturable reo- and enteroviruses, with an average concentration was 0. 001 to 0. 007 culturable virus particles per litre. The decimal reduction caused by the WBB storage reservoirs was 1. 4 log 10 -units for reoviruses and 2. 1 log 10 -units for enteroviruses. Molecular methods did not detect rotavirus RNA in either the source water or the produced water. Norovirus RNA, however, was detected in several samples of source and produced water.

40|$|During rescue {{excavations}} in Gabułtów, district Kazimierza Wielka, {{a series}} of skeleton graves was discovered. Three of them represent the Trzciniec culture of the older stage of the Bronze Age. Excavations conducted in this group of graves lead to collecting com-pletely preserved vessels together with bronze ware's (grave 2) as well as not numerous series of pottery fragments with one stone object, later on recognised as a tool (grave 4). The grave number 6 was empty (comp, paper by J. Górski and P. Jarosz in this volume). The mentioned artifact {{was found on the}} pit-bottom of the grave 4 and therefore it is clear that belongs to the grave goods. The <b>half-product</b> of this tool was an massive, oval in shape thick flake of the tiny-grain sandstone, most probably of the Carpathians provenience: length 10. 2 cm, width 8. 0 cm, thickness 4. 2 cm. The platform is completely covered by the negatives of preparation, the bulb of force is divided into twin points, ripple marks on the ventral side are not well visi-ble. Both surfaces of artefact, dorsal and ventral were sparse and irregular retouched. This was made by one reduction series only.
