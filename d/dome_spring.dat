50|$|The {{church was}} {{rectangular}} in plan. The northwest corner {{was occupied by}} the tower, {{and the rest of}} the north side was taken by an aisle, containing a gallery. Most of the church, however, was covered by an octagonal <b>dome,</b> <b>springing</b> from seven half-columns against the walls, and from one complete column in front of the north gallery. Robert Seymour described the building in 1733:This church and tower are well built with Stone, the Roof covered with lead, supported with Demy-Columns of the Composite Order; the floor is paved with stone, and pewed, with three Isles...and the whole is commodious and pleasant, tho' small. An organ was installed in 1805.|$|R
2500|$|The {{practice}} of building rotating domes for housing large telescopes was {{begun in the}} 19th century, with early examples using papier-mâché to minimize weight. Unique glass <b>domes</b> <b>springing</b> straight from ground level were used for hothouses and winter gardens. Elaborate covered shopping arcades included large glazed domes at their cross intersections. The large domes of the 19th century included exhibition buildings and functional structures such as gasometers and locomotive sheds. The [...] "first fully triangulated framed dome" [...] was built in Berlin in 1863 by Johann Wilhelm Schwedler and, {{by the start of}} the 20th century, similarly triangulated frame domes had become fairly common. Vladimir Shukhov was also an early pioneer of what would later be called gridshell structures and in 1897 he employed them in domed exhibit pavilions at the All-Russia Industrial and Art Exhibition.|$|R
25|$|At Autun Cathedral, France, {{the pattern}} of the nave bays and aisles extends beyond the {{crossing}} and into the chancel, each aisle terminating in an apse. Each nave bay is separated at the vault by a transverse rib. Each transept projects to the width of two nave bays. The entrance has a narthex which screens the main portal. This type of entrance was to be elaborated in the Gothic period on the transepts at Chartres. Angoulême Cathedral, France, is one of several instances in which the Byzantine churches of Constantinople seem to have been influential in the design in which the main spaces are roofed by domes. This structure has necessitated the use of very thick walls, and massive piers from which the <b>domes</b> <b>spring.</b> There are radiating chapels around the apse, which is a typically French feature and was to evolve into the chevet.|$|R
5|$|An {{important}} feature of Western Chalukya roof art {{is the use of}} domical ceilings (not {{to be confused with the}} European types that are built of voussoirs with radiating joints) and square ceilings. Both types of ceilings originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive. The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. The top is closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in place by the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of the dome. The triangular spaces created when the <b>dome</b> <b>springs</b> from the centre of the square are filled with arabesques. In the case of square ceilings, the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from Hindu mythology.|$|R

50|$|Built {{of white}} {{sandstone}} and brick it {{is surrounded by}} a wall with a gateway. It is of two stories, supported on pillars, and a canopy with arches on each side. The lower courses of richly carved stone are of great age. Above them runs a frieze with an unintelligible pattern, and, above this, running right round the building, a fringe of elephants' heads and forequarters carved in stone. Above this is a very ranch worn frieze full of figures in bass-relief, men on horseback with bows, and animals. The elephant is a very frequent emblem. Besides the fringe frieze above mentioned, there are, on the outer wall, between every two angles, larger figures of semi-rampant elephants standing out in relief, and, in front of the entrance, stands {{on either side of the}} doorway a gigantic cement elephant. Above the shrine, a pyramid-based tower rises into a spire like a high-shouldered cone with flattened sides. The forepart of the roof consists of a number of small <b>domes</b> <b>springing</b> from a flat roof, or rather of a flat trabeate roof, with domes here and there, the largest being in the centre. Outside at all the angles of the roof are figures of animals and the gargoyles. On walls, there are some scenes from the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana.|$|R
5000|$|Architecture of a Romanesque style {{developed}} {{simultaneously in}} parts of France in the 10th century and prior to the later influence of the Abbey of Cluny. The style, sometimes called [...] "First Romanesque" [...] or [...] "Lombard Romanesque", is characterised by thick walls, lack of sculpture {{and the presence of}} rhythmic ornamental arches known as a Lombard band. The Angoulême Cathedral is one of several instances in which the Byzantine churches of Constantinople seem to have been influential in the design in which the main spaces are roofed by domes. This structure has necessitated the use of very thick walls, and massive piers from which the <b>domes</b> <b>spring.</b> There are radiating chapels around the apse, which is a typically French feature and was to evolve into the chevette. Notre-Dame in Domfront, Normandy is a cruciform church with a short apsidal east end. The nave has lost its aisle, and has probably some of its length. The crossing has a tower that rises in two differentiated stages and is surmounted by a pyramidical spire of a type seen widely in France and Germany and also on Norman towers in England. The Abbey of Fongombault in France shows the influence of the Abbey of Cluny. The cruciform plan is clearly visible. There is a chevette of chapels surrounding the chance apse. The crossing is surmounted by a tower. The transepts end with gables.|$|R
60|$|From the {{windmills}} of Montmartre, {{the day we}} ascended, the eye took in {{the whole}} vast capital at a glance. The <b>domes</b> <b>sprung</b> up through the mist, like starling balloons; and here and there the meandering stream threw back a gleam of silvery light. Enormous roofs denoted the sites of the palaces, churches, or theatres. The summits of columns, the crosses of the minor churches, and the pyramids of pavilion tops, seemed struggling to rear their heads from out the plain of edifices. A better idea of {{the vastness of the}} principal structures was obtained here in one hour, than could be got from the streets in a twelvemonth. Taking the roofs of the palace, for instance, the eye followed its field of slate and lead through a parallelogram for quite a mile. The sheet of the French opera resembled a blue pond, and the aisles of Notre Dame and St. Eustache, with their slender ribs and massive buttresses, towered so much above the lofty houses around them, as to seem to stand on their ridges. The church of St. Geneviève, the Pantheon of the revolution, faced us on the swelling land of {{the opposite side of the}} town, but surrounded still with crowded lines of dwellings; the Observatory limiting equally the view, and the vast field of houses in that direction.|$|R
50|$|The Mokelumne is also {{a popular}} site for fishing, camping, water play, birding, picnics, gold panning, spring wildflower watching, and other activities. Electra Road, just east of Highway 49, is a popular place to run, walk, and enjoy the river. The large granite domes, Calaveras Dome and Hammer <b>Dome,</b> near Salt <b>Springs</b> Reservoir, are popular for {{technical}} rock climbing. Three campgrounds are also located near Salt Springs: Mokelumne River, White Azalea, and Moore Creek.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek District Railway (Short Line) passed from Cripple Creek through St. Peter's <b>Dome</b> to Colorado <b>Springs.</b> In 1902, about 200,000 people took the train along {{the rim of}} South Cheyenne Cañon to Colorado Springs. It was a picnic and camping site. The {{vertical}} ascent of 10 ft was first made by a wooden ladder and then a spiral staircase. It is now made by using a knotted rope.|$|R
50|$|Shivar Springs Bottling Company Cisterns {{is a set}} of six {{historic}} cisterns {{located near}} Winnsboro, Fairfield County, South Carolina. They were built about 1900, and are a group of six cylindrical, stuccoed stone cisterns with concrete <b>domes.</b> The Shivar <b>Springs</b> Bottling Company was in operation from about 1900 to about 1950. At first the company produced only mineral water which was sold for medicinal purposes. Later both mineral water and soft drinks were produced from the spring water and shipped throughout the state.|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{of these}} French churches may be Angoulême Cathedral, built from 1105 to 1128. Its long nave {{is covered by}} four stone <b>domes</b> on pendentives, <b>springing</b> from pointed arches, the last of which covers the crossing and is surmounted by a stone lantern. Cahors Cathedral (c. 1100–1119) covers its nave with two large domes {{in the same manner}} and influenced the later building at Souillac. The abbey church at Fontevrault served as a burial place for Plantagenet royalty, including Richard the Lionheart, {{and is one of the}} most impressive examples. The earlier domed crossing is preceded by a wider nave covered by four domes, which was begun in 1125. The pendentives are original, but the four nave domes are modern replacements from about 1910. The cathedral of S. Front at Périgueux was built c. 1125–1150 and derives its five-domed cruciform plan ultimately from the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople.|$|R
50|$|On August 7, 2013 {{a spring}} that had {{supplied}} mineral {{water for the}} village of Lichk (Թթու ջուր; meaning sour water) was demolished {{without the consent of}} the townspeople. The artesian well had been drilled approximately 40 years ago by Soviet engineers, and was used by residents of the village since then. Many had used the naturally carbonated spring daily, as a main source of drinking water or in hopes of curing certain ailments. A contract was secured through the local government by a businessman to construct a bottling plant at the site to produce soft drinks. Construction began in early-August and the <b>dome</b> of the <b>spring,</b> created by minerals in the water, was destroyed. Residents protested the move made by the local government and took back control of their water source. Restoration efforts were soon underway so that residents could once again use the source of water again. On June 12, 2015 the artesian well was uncapped through the efforts of residents in Lichk and is once again open for use.|$|R
40|$|In January 2006, Augustine Volcano began erupting {{following}} {{an increase in}} seismicity that was first noted in late April 2005. Thirteen large explosive eruptions of Augustine occurred from January 11 to 28, 2006, followed by a continuously erupting phase and then by a dome growth phase in which numerous pyroclastic flows and block-and-ash flows occurred. As a new steep-sided and unstable <b>dome</b> grew in <b>spring</b> 2006, rockfalls and related events, likely block-and-ash flows, dominated the seismic record. Relative amplitudes at pairs of seismic stations for 68 block-and-ash flow events were examined to constrain locations of the flow-events. Higher amplitudes were associated with events closer to a given station. These relations were confirmed by images collected on a low-light camera. Captured images show a correlation between flow direction and seismic amplitude ratios from nearby stations AUE and AUW. Seismic amplitudes and energies of the flow signals, measured in several different ways, were found to correlate with the surface areas and run-out distances of the flows. The ML range of rockfalls was 0. 1 to 1. 1, and seismic efficiencies were estimated to be much less than 1 %. Particle motion analyses showed that the seismic waves contained both body waves and surface waves and demonstrate that the flows were acting as moving sources with velocities of 30 – 93 m/s...|$|R

6000|$|... [FN#20] There {{are many}} {{qualifications}} necessary for an Imam-a leader of prayer; the first condition, of course, is orthodoxy. [FN#21] [...] "The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night," [...] (Psalm cxxi. 6). Easterns still believe {{firmly in the}} evil effects of moonlight upon the human frame,-from Sind to Abyssinia, the traveller will hear tales of wonder concerning it. [FN#22] The Dum i Gurg, or wolf's tail, is the Persian name for the first brushes of grey light which appear as forerunners of dawn. [FN#23] Dar al-Bayda is a palace belonging to H.H. Abbas Pasha. This [...] "white house" [...] was formerly called the [...] "red house," [...] I believe from the colour of its windows,-but the name was changed, as being not particularly good-omened. [FN#24] The Tetrao Kata or sand-grouse, (Pterocles melanogaster; in Sind called the rock pigeon), is a fast-flying bird, not unlike a grey partridge whilst upon the wing. When, therefore, Shanfara boasts [...] "The ash-coloured Katas can only drink my leavings, after hastening all night to slake their thirst in the morning," [...] it is a hyperbole to express exceeding swiftness. [FN#25] I have already, when writing upon the subject of Sind, alluded to this system as prevalent throughout Al-Islam, and professed, like Mr. Lane, ignorance of its origin and object. In Huc's travels, {{we are told that}} the Tartars worship mountain spirits by raising an [...] "Obo,"-dry branches hung with bones and strips of cloth, and planted in enormous heaps of stones. Park, also, in Western Africa, conformed to the example of his companions, in adding a charm or shred of cloth on a tree (at the entrance of the Wilderness), which was completely covered with these guardian symbols. And, finally, the Tarikh Tabari mentions it as a practice of the Pagan Arabs, and talks of evil spirits residing in the date-tree. May not, then, the practice in Al-Islam be one of the many debris of fetish-worship which entered into the heterogeneous formation of the Saving Faith? Some believe that the Prophet permitted the practice, and explain the peculiar name of the expedition called Zat al-Rika'a (place of shreds of cloth), by supposing it to be a term for a tree to which the Moslems hung their ex-voto rags. [FN#26] The saint lies under a little white-washed <b>dome,</b> <b>springing</b> from a square of low walls-a form of sepulchre now common to Al-Hijaz, Egypt, and the shores and islands of the Red Sea. As regards his name my informants told me it was that of a Hijazi Shaykh. The subject is by no means interesting; but the exact traveller will find the word written Takroore, and otherwise explained by Sir Gardner Wilkinson. [FN#27] Called by the Arabs Shih [Arabic text], which the dictionaries translate [...] "wormwood of Pontus." [...] We find Wallin in his works speaking of Ferashat al-shih, or wormwood carpets. [FN#28] We are told in verse of [...] "a cocoa's feathery shade," [...] and sous l'ombre d'un cocotier. But to realise the prose picture, let the home reader, choosing some sultry August day, fasten a large fan to a long pole, and enjoy himself under it. [FN#29] On a subsequent occasion, I met a party of Panjabis, who had walked from Meccah to Cairo in search of [...] "Abu Tabilah," [...] (General Avitabile), whom report had led to the banks of the Nile. Some were young, others had white beards-all were weary and wayworn; but the saddest sight was an old woman, so decrepit that she could scarcely walk. The poor fellows were travelling on foot, carrying their wallets, with a few pence in their pockets, utterly ignorant of route and road, and actually determined in this plight to make Lahore by Baghdad, Bushir, and Karachi. Such-so incredible-is Indian improvidence! [FN#30] Upon this word Cacography has done her worst-"Haji Rood" [...] may serve for a specimen. My informants told me that Al-'Ajrudi is the name of a Hijazi Shaykh whose mortal remains repose under a little dome near the fort. This, if it be true, completely nullifies the efforts of Etymology to discern in it a distinct allusion to [...] "the overthrow of Pharaoh's chariots, whose Hebrew appellation, ‘Ageloot,' bears some resemblance to this modern name." [...] [FN#31] The only sweet water in Suez is brought on camel back from the Nile, across the Desert. The [...] "Bir Suez" [...] is fit for beasts only; the 'Uyun Musa (Moses' Wells) on the Eastern side, and that below Abu Daraj, on the Western shore of the Suez Gulf, are but little better. The want of sweet water is the reason why no Hammam is found at Suez. [FN#32] The [...] "George": so called after its owner, a Copt, Consular Agent for Belgium. There are 36 Caravanserais at Suez, 33 small ones for merchandise, and 3 for travellers; of these the best is that of Sayyid Hashim. The pilgrim, however, must not expect much comfort or convenience, even at Sayyid Hashim's.|$|R
2500|$|The diagram {{shows the}} {{outlines}} of the solution of the problem. If a hemispherical dome is cut by four vertical planes, the intersection gives four semicircular arches; if cut in addition by a horizontal plane tangent {{to the top of the}}se arches, it describes a circle; that portion of the sphere which is below this circle and between the arches, forming a spherical spandril, is the pendentive, and its radius is equal to the diagonal of the square on which the four arches rest. Having obtained a circle for the base of the dome, it is not necessary that the upper portion of the <b>dome</b> should <b>spring</b> from the same level as the arches, or that its domical surface should be a continuation of that of the pendentive. The first and second dome of the Hagia Sophia apparently fell down, so that Justinian determined to raise it, possibly to give greater lightness to the structure, but mainly in order to obtain increased light for the interior of the church. This was effected by piercing it with forty windows - the effect of which, as the light streaming through these windows, gave the dome the appearance of being suspended in the air. The pendentive which carried the dome rested on four great arches, the thrust of those crossing the church being counteracted by immense buttresses which traversed the aisles, and the other two partly by smaller arches in the apse, the thrust being carried to the outer walls, and to a certain extent by the side walls which were built under the arches. From the description given by Procopius we gather that the centering employed for the great arches consisted of a wall erected to support them during their erection. The construction of the pendentives is not known, but it is surmised that to the top of the pendentives they were built in horizontal courses of brick, projecting one over the other, the projecting angles being cut off afterwards and covered with stucco in which the mosaics were embedded; this was the method employed in the erection of the Périgordian domes, to which we shall return; these, however, were of less diameter than those of the Hagia Sophia, being only about 40 to [...] instead of [...] The apotheosis of Byzantine architecture, in fact, was reached in Hagia Sophia, for although it formed the model on which all subsequent Byzantine churches were based, so far as their plan was concerned, no domes approaching the former in dimensions were even attempted. The principal difference in some later examples is that which took place in the form of the pendentive on which the dome was carried. Instead of the spherical spandril of Hagia Sophia, large niches were formed in the angles, as in the Mosque of Damascus, which was built by Byzantine workmen for the Al-Walid I in A.D. 705; these gave an octagonal base on which the hemispherical dome rested; or again, as in the Sassanian palaces of Sarvestan and Firouzabad of the 4th and 5th century, when a series of concentric arch rings, projecting one in front of the other, were built, giving also an octagonal base; each of these pendentives is known as a squinch.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 144 - 154) Homer Mountain {{is located}} in the northern portion of the eastern Mojave Desert Province. Basement rock exposed in the 250 km 2 study area consists of Precambrian large K-spar granitoid gneiss which is intruded by two Late Cretaceous peraluminous quartz monzonite plutons (Teutonia and Homer Mountain plutons). These plutons are similiar to the Mid Hills adamellite of the Teutonia batholithic complex of the New York Mountains. Developed within the eastern portion of the Precambrian basement, prior to the late Mesozoic plutonism, are a small number of thin, north-trending, east-dipping mylonitic zones. An early Tertiary or older system of generally northtrending altered tholeiitic quartz gabbro dikes are exposed in the central portion of the study area and intrude these basement rocks. Northwest- to northeasttrending conjugate leucocratic aplite dikes are interpreted to have been intruded along with scattered mineralized quartz veins during the final stage of Late Cretaceous plutonism. Late Cretaceous to early Tertiary (?) submarginally economic molybdenium-copper-tungsten mineralization in the western portion of the study area accompanied emplacement of the quartz veins along a northwest-trending shear zone and east-west-trending joints. Younger middle Tertiary age hydrothermal mineralization appears to have accompanied the intrusion of numerous east-west-trending felsic dikes. A similar pattern of mineralization associated with east-west-trending diking is developed in the New York Mountains and further west in the Cima <b>Dome</b> and Granite <b>Spring</b> area. During latest Oligocene time calc-alkaline basalt to quartz andesite flows were extruded onto the western portion of the study area and today cap the highest hills. These flows are associated with the volcanics of the southern Piute Range. A sample of the andesitic flows has yielded a K-Ar age of 27. 7 ?? 1. 4 m. y. B. P. As these andesitic flows were being extruded, the Homer Mountain conglomerate, a cobble- to boulder-sized monolithic conglomerate with minor sandstone and volcanic interbeds, was being deposited in the eastern portion of the study area within a probable steep-walled graben. This conglomerate is intruded by alkalic rhyolitic breccia plugs which have yielded a latest Oligocene K-Ar age of 26. 0 ?? 1. 7 m. y. B. P. The graben into which the Homer Mountain conglomerate was deposited was probably formed during the earliest phase of low-angle detachment faulting which was prevalent during the middle Tertiary in the present day lower Colorado River region. Also in the eastern portion of the study area, northtrending granophyric rhyodacite porphyry dikes and/or sills were intruded into the Precambrian and Mesozoic basement subparallel to the pre-Teutonia mylonitic zones. A sample of this granophyric dike has yielded a latest Oligocene K-Ar age of 27. 2 ?? 2. 7 m. y. B. P. (See more in text...|$|R
6000|$|Wilford (As. Soc. vols. iii. and iv.) {{makes the}} Hindus declare that the Black Stone at Mokshesha, or Moksha-sthana (Meccah) was an {{incarnation}} of Moksheshwara, an incarnation of Shiwa, {{who with his}} consort visited Al-Hijaz. When the Ka’abah was rebuilt, this emblem {{was placed in the}} outer wall for contempt, but the people still respected it. In the Dabistan the Black Stone is said to be an image of Kaywan or Saturn; and Al-Shahristani also declares the temple to have been dedicated to the same planet Zuhal, whose genius is represented in the Puranas as fierce, hideous, four-armed, and habited in a black cloak, with a dark turband. Moslem historians are unanimous in asserting that Sasan, son of Babegan, and other Persian monarchs, gave rich presents to the Ka’abah; they especially mention two golden crescent moons, a significant offering. The Guebers assert that, among the images and relics left by Mahabad and his successors in the Ka’abah, was the Black Stone, an emblem of Saturn. They also call the city Mahgah— moon’s place—from an exceedingly beautiful image of the moon; whence they say the Arabs derived “Meccah.” And the Sabaeans equally respect the Ka’abah and the pyramids, which they assert to be the tombs of Seth, Enoch (or Hermes), and Sabi the son of Enoch. Meccah, then, is claimed as a sacred place, and the Hajar al-Aswad, as well as the Ka’abah, are revered as holy emblems by four different faiths—the Hindu, Sabæan, Gueber, and Moslem. I have little doubt, and hope to prove at another time, that the Jews connected it with traditions about Abraham. This would be the fifth religion that looked towards the Ka’abah—a rare meeting-place of devotion. [FN#21] Presenting this appearance in profile. The Hajar has suffered from the iconoclastic principle of Islam, having once narrowly escaped destruction by order of Al-Hakim of Egypt. In these days the metal rim serves as a protection as well as an ornament. [FN#22] The height of the Hajar from the ground, according to my measurement, is four feet nine inches; Ali Bey places it forty-two inches above the pavement. [FN#23] The colour was black and metallic, and the centre of the stone was sunk about two inches below the metal circle. Round the sides was a reddish-brown cement, almost level with the metal, and sloping down {{to the middle of the}} stone. Ibn Jubayr declares the depth of the stone unknown, but that most people believe it to extend two cubits into the wall. In his day it was three “Shibr” (the large span from the thumb to the little finger-tip) broad, and one span long, with knobs, and a joining of four pieces, which the Karamitah had broken. The stone was set in a silver band. “Its softness and moisture were such,” says Ibn Jubayr, “that the sinner would never remove his mouth from it, which phenomenon made the Prophet declare it to be the covenant of Allah on earth.” [FN#24] The band is now a massive circle of gold or silver gilt. I found the aperture in which the stone is, one span and three fingers broad. [FN#25] The “Rukn al-Yamani” is the corner facing the South. The part alluded to in the text is the wall of the Ka’abah, between the Shami and Yamani angles, distant about three feet from the latter, and near the site of the old western door, long since closed. The stone is darker and redder than the rest of the wall. It is called Al-Mustajab (or Mustajab min al-Zunub or Mustajab al-Dua, “where prayer is granted”). Pilgrims here extend their arms, press their bodies against the building, and beg pardon for their sins. [FN#26] I have frequently seen it kissed by men and women. [FN#27] Al-Ma’ajan, the place of mixing or kneading, because the patriarchs here kneaded the mud used as cement in the holy building. Some call it Al-Hufrah (the digging), and it is generally known as Makam Jibrail (the place of Gabriel), because here descended the inspired order for the five daily prayers, and at this spot the Archangel and the Prophet performed their devotions, making it a most auspicious spot. It is on the north of the door, from which it is distant about two feet; its length is seven spans and seven fingers; breadth five spans three fingers; and depth one span four fingers. The following sentence from Herklet’s “Qanoon e Islam” (ch. xii. sec. 5) may serve to show the extent of error still popular. The author, after separating the Bayt Ullah from the Ka’abah, erroneously making the former the name of the whole temple, proceeds to say, “the rain-water which falls on its (the Ka’abah’s) terrace runs off through a golden spout on a stone near it, called Rookn-e-Yemeni, or alabaster-stone), and stands over the grave of Ismaeel.”—! [FN#28] Generally called Mizab al-Rahmah (of Mercy). It carries rain from the roof, and discharges it upon Ishmael’s grave, where pilgrims stand fighting to catch it. In Al-Idrisi’s time it was of wood; now it is said to be gold, but it looks very dingy. [FN#29] Usually called the Hajar al-Akhzar, or green stone. Al-Idrisi speaks of a white stone covering Ishmael’s remains; Ibn Jubayr of “green marble, longish, in form of a Mihrab arch, and near it a white round slab, in both of which are spots that make them appear yellow.” Near them, we are told, and towards the Iraki corner, is the tomb of Hagar, under a green slab one span and a half broad, and pilgrims used to pray at both places. Ali Bey erroneously applies the words Al-Hajar Ismail to the parapet about the slab. [FN#30] My measurements give five feet six inches. In Al-Idrisi’s day the wall was fifty cubits long. [FN#31] Al-Hatim ([Arabic] lit. the “broken”). Burckhardt asserts that the Mekkawi no longer apply the word, as some historians do, to the space bounded by the Ka’abah, the Partition, the Zemzem, and the Makam of Ibrahim. I heard it, however, so used by learned Meccans, and they gave as the meaning of the name the break in this part of the oval pavement which surrounds the Ka’abah. Historians relate that all who rebuilt the “House of Allah” followed Abraham’s plan till the Kuraysh, and after them Al-Hajjaj curtailed it in the direction of Al-Hatim, which part was then first broken off, and ever since remained so. [FN#32] Al-Hijr ([Arabic]) is the space separated, as the name denotes, from the Ka’abah. Some suppose that Abraham here penned his sheep. Possibly Ali Bey means this part of the Temple when he speaks of Al-Hajar ([Arabic]) Ismail—les pierres d’Ismail. [FN#33] “Al-Hajjaj”; this, as will afterwards be seen, is a mistake. He excluded the Hatim. [FN#34] As well as memory serves me, for I have preserved no note, the inscriptions are in the marble casing, and indeed no other stone meets the eye. [FN#35] It is a fine, close, grey polished granite: the walk is called Al-Mataf, or the place of circumambulation. [FN#36] These are now iron posts, very numerous, supporting cross rods, and of tolerably elegant shape. In Ali Bey’s time there were “trente-une colonnes minces en piliers en bronze.” Some native works say thirty-three, including two marble columns. Between each two hang several white or green glass globe-lamps, with wicks and oil floating on water; their light is faint and dismal. The whole of the lamps in the Harim is said to be more than 1000, yet they serve but to “make darkness visible.” [FN#37] There are only four “Makams,” the Hanafi, Maliki, Hanbali, and the Makam Ibrahim; and there is some error of diction below, for in these it is that the Imams stand before their congregations, and nearest the Ka’abah. In Ibn Jubayr’s time the Zaydi sect was allowed an Imam, though known to be schismatics and abusers of the caliphs. Now, not being permitted to have a separate station for prayer, they suppose theirs to be suspended from heaven above the Ka’abah roof. [FN#38] The Makam al-Maliki is on the west of, and thirty-seven cubits from, the Ka’abah; that of the Hanbali forty-seven paces distant. [FN#39] Only the Mu’ezzin takes his stand here, and the Shafe’is pray behind their Imam on the pavement round the Ka’abah, between the corner of the well Zemzem, and the Makam Ibrahim. This place is forty cubits from the Ka’abah, that is say, eight cubits nearer than the Northern and Southern “Makams.” Thus the pavement forms an irregular oval ring round the house[.] [FN#40] In Burckhardt’s time the schools prayed according to the seniority of their founders, and they uttered the Azan of Al-Maghrib together, because that is a peculiarly delicate hour, which easily passes by unnoticed. In the twelfth century, at all times but the evening, the Shafe’i began, then came the Maliki and Hanbali simultaneously, and, lastly, the Hanafi. Now the Shaykh al-Mu’ezzin begins the call, which is taken up by the others. He is a Hanafi; as indeed are all the principal people at Meccah, only a few wild Sharifs of the hills being Shafe’i. [FN#41] The door of the Zemzem building fronts to the south-east. [FN#42] This is not exactly correct. As the plan will show, the angle of one building touches the angle of its neighbour. [FN#43] Their names and offices are now changed. One is called the Kubbat al-Sa’at, and contains the clocks and chronometers (two of them English) sent as presents to the Mosque by the Sultan. The other, known as the Kubbat al-Kutub, is used as a store-room for manuscripts bequeathed to the Mosque. They still are open to Burckhardt’s just criticism, being nothing but the common <b>dome</b> <b>springing</b> from four walls, and vulgarly painted with bands of red, yellow, and green. In Ibn Jubayr’s time the two domes contained bequests of books and candles. The Kubbat Abbas, or that further from the Ka’abah than its neighbour, was also called Kubbat al-Sharab (the Dome of Drink), because Zemzem water was here kept cooling for the use of pilgrims in Daurak, or earthen jars. The nearer was termed Kubbat al-Yahudi; and the tradition they told me was, that a Jew having refused to sell his house upon the spot, it was allowed to remain in loco by the Prophet, as a lasting testimony to his regard for justice. A similar tale is told of an old woman’s hut, which was allowed to stand in the corner of the Great Nushirawan’s royal halls. [FN#44] Called “Al-Daraj.” A correct drawing of it may be found in Ali Bey’s work. [FN#45] The Bab al-Salam, or Bab al-Nabi, or Bab benu Shaybah, resembles in its isolation a triumphal arch, and is built of cut stone. [FN#46] “The (praying) place of Abraham.” Readers will remember that the Meccan Mosque is peculiarly connected with Ibrahim, whom Moslems prefer to all prophets except Mohammed. [FN#47] This I believe to be incorrect. I was asked five dollars for permission to enter; but the sum was too high for my finances. Learned men told me that the stone shows the impress of two feet, especially the big toes, and devout pilgrims fill the cavities with water, which they rub over their eyes and faces. When the Caliph al-Mahdi visited Meccah, one Abdullah bin Osman presented himself at the unusual hour of noon, and informing the prince that he had brought him a relic which no man but himself had yet seen, produced this celebrated stone. Al-Mahdi, rejoicing greatly, kissed it, rubbed his face against it, and pouring water upon it, drank the draught. Kutb al-Din, one of the Meccan historians, says that it was visited in his day. In Ali Bey’s time it was covered with “un magnifique drap noir brode en or et en argent avec de gros glands en or;” he does not say, however, that he saw the stone. Its veils, called Sitr Ibrahim al-Khalil, are a green “Ibrisham,” or silk mixed with cotton and embroidered with gold. They are made at Cairo of three different colours, black, red, and green; and one is devoted to each year. The gold embroidery is in the Sulsi character, and expresses the Throne-verse, the Chapter of the Cave, and the name of the reigning Sultan; on the top is “Allah,” below it “Mohammed”; beneath this is “Ibrahim al-Khalil”; and at each corner is the name of one of the four caliphs. In a note to the “Dabistan” (vol. ii. p. 410), we find two learned Orientalists confounding the Black Stone with Abraham’s Station or Platform. “The Prophet honoured the Black Stone, upon which Abraham conversed with Hagar, to which he tied his camels, and upon which the traces of his feet are still seen.” [FN#48] Not only here, I was told by learned Meccans, but under all the oval pavements surrounding the Ka’abah. [FN#49] The spring gushes from the southern base of Mount Arafat, as will afterwards be noticed. It is exceedingly pure. [FN#50] The author informs us that “the first pulpit was sent from Cairo in A.H. 818, together with the staircase, both being the gifts of Moayed, caliph of Egypt.” Ali Bey accurately describes the present Mambar. [FN#51] The curious will find a specimen of a Moslem sermon in Lane’s Mod. Egypt. Vol. i. ch. iii. [FN#52] Burckhardt “subjoins their names as they are usually written upon small cards by the Metowefs; in another column are the names by which they were known in more ancient times, principally taken from Azraky and Kotoby.” I have added a few remarks in brackets[.] ...|$|R
40|$|The Fort Rock dome, in Yavapai County, Arizona, is a {{recently}} discovered circular geological structure, two miles in diameter, which initially aroused interest {{because of its}} similarity to an impact crater. Features of the dome {{that are similar to}} features of an impact crater include a crater-like depression in its center underlain by brecciated Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks, upturned Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rocks on its rim, radial and tangential faults, and an apron of breccia on its flanks showing a crude inversion of the pre-breccia stratigraphy. Studies by the writer have indicated that the structure is primarily a volcanic dome caused by an intrusion at depth. The crater on top is erosional in origin. Rocks exposed {{in the vicinity of the}} Fort Rock dome range in age from Precambrian to Quaternary. Precambrian rocks include layered metamorphic rocks, cataclasites, granite, granite pegmatite, and veined rocks. These rocks are part of a broad belt of Precambrian rocks exposed in the mountains of central Arizona along the southwestern margin of the Colorado Plateau. Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, seen northeast of the dome, range in age from Cambrian to Mississippian. Tertiary volcanic rocks overlie chiefly Precambrian rocks in a large area, about 1000 square miles in extent, west and south of the dome. Numerous volcanic centers are scattered throughout this area; the Fort Rock dome is one relatively small center. Quaternary deposits include alluvium and terrace deposits. The chief structures in the region are Basin and Range faults. Between the dome and Seligman, Arizona, to the northeast, north-south normal faults with displacements of hundreds of feet form low, linear ranges and broad valleys. In the Aquarius Mountains, west of the dome, several east-west normal faults offset rocks by hundreds of feet. On the eastern edge of Big Sandy Wash, west of the Aquarius Mountains, a north-south fault with a displacement of 1000 feet is responsible for a major escarpment in the Basin and Range Province that is continuous with the Grand Wash Cliffs to the north. Most Phanerozoic rocks in the region are relatively flat-lying. The Fort Rock dome is an anomalous area where Tertiary rocks are highly deformed. Precambrian rocks on the Fort Rock dome are similar to older Precambrian rocks at the Grand Canyon, Arizona. Layered metamorphic rocks on the dome include amphibolite, schist, phyllonite, and gneiss. These rocks belong to the epidote-amphibolite metamorphic facies. Cataclasite bodies, which are present in the layered metamorphic rocks, appear to be granite intrusions that are crushed and foliated. Granites and granite pegmatites intrude the layered metamorphic rocks and cataclasites. They are also crushed but are not foliated. The Precambrian rocks are fractured and veined in an east-west shear zone that crosses the southern half of the dome. Veined rocks are covered by Tertiary volcanic rocks on the rim of the crater. Veined rocks in a similar shear zone several miles north of the dome are covered by Tapeats Sandstone, of Cambrian age. Tertiary volcanic rocks lie on a mid-Tertiary erosion surface that covered most of northwestern Arizona and is responsible for much of the topography seen today in this area. Volcanic rocks in the vicinity of the Fort Rock dome comprise chiefly two formations, here given the names Crater Pasture Formation and Fort Rock Creek Rhyodacite; the Crater Pasture Formation is the older of the two. In addition to these two formations, several lava flows and intrusive bodies are present which are younger than the Fort Rock Creek Rhyodacite, including a unit herein referred to as the basalt of Buttox Hills. Other volcanic rocks in the region include the Peach Springs Tuff, of middle Miocene age, which overlies the Fort Rock Creek Rhyodacite ten miles west of the dome, and younger Mohon Mountain volcanics, south of Trout Creek. The Crater Pasture Formation includes a series of lava flows, agglomerates, tuffs, and associated intrusive and sedimentary rocks in the vicinity of the Fort Rock dome. The volcanic rocks range in composition from ultramafic to intermediate. In the vicinity of the dome, eleven chief subunits have been recognized. Reconnaissance mapping has indicated that volcanic rocks in an extensive area west and north of the dome are of similar age and composition and can also be included in this formation. The subunits recognized at the dome include, from oldest to youngest (where relative age is known), a limburgite flow, an olivine-trachyandesite volcanic breccia and flow, a hornblende-trachybasalt flow, a pyroxene-trachyandesite tuff and flow, three hornblende-trachyandesite flows, an olivine and hornblende trachyandesite tuff and conglomerate, a sedimentary breccia, an olivine-trachybasalt tuff and agglomerate, and an olivine-sanidine-trachybasalt flow. Most of these rocks were erupted from vents located on or near the periphery of the Fort Rock dome, and most are traceable for distances of a mile or less. The sedimentary breccia, which in this report is referred to as the sedimentary breccia of One O'Clock Wash, is a local deposit on the flanks of the dome that consists of clasts eroded from the dome. This unit was deposited during uplift of the dome. The youngest unit in the formation, an olivine-sanidine-trachybasalt flow, herein referred to as the flow of Fault Canyon, was erupted from a vent on the southwest flank of the dome. This flow apparently came from a magma beneath the dome, which is believed to have been responsible for the uplift. The Fort Rock Creek Rhyodacite includes a series of ash-flow tuffs and other massive tuffs, volcanic breccias, lava flows, and associated intrusive and sedimentary rocks in the Aquarius Mountains and vicinity. The composition of the volcanic rocks of this formation is chiefly rhyodacite. Subunits recognized are here given the names, in order from oldest to youngest, the sedimentary breccia of Noon Gorge, the Old Stage Road Member, the Three Sisters Butte Member, and the breccia and conglomerate of the Crossing. The sedimentary breccia of Noon Gorge is a local deposit on the flanks of the Fort Rock dome consisting chiefly of clasts eroded from the dome. The Old Stage Road Member is a unit chiefly of non-welded ash-flow tuff that extends throughout the Aquarius Mountains and into surrounding areas. The Three Sisters Butte Member is a unit of interbedded volcanic breccia and massive tuff which is found throughout the Aquarius Mountains. The breccia and conglomerate of the Crossing is chiefly a volcanic breccia; it occurs on the northeast flank of the Aquarius Mountains. The Old Stage Road Member, the Three Sisters Butte Member, and the breccia and conglomerate of the Crossing were erupted from a large rhyodacite center in the Aquarius Mountains located about 2 - 1 / 2 miles southwest of the Fort Rock dome. The basalt of Buttox Hills is a local flow that overlies ash-flow tuff on the southeast side of the dome. A dike of this unit intrudes rocks on the dome. Quaternary units include alluvium in washes, older alluvium on terraces, and colluvium. Terrace deposits are extensive east of the Fort Rock dome. They contain abundant clasts of Paleozoic sedimentary rocks that were derived from terrane to the north and east. Precambrian structures on the dome include folds of different amplitudes in the layered metamorphic rocks and an east-west shear zone in the southern half of the dome. The shear zone, which is characterized by fractured and veined Precambrian rocks, brings together in the dome differing rock assemblages and also rocks of slightly differing metamorphic grade. This shear zone appears to be part of a major discontinuity in Precambrian rocks that is traceable for 70 miles on an aeromagnetic map from near Ashfork, Arizona, to the western edge of the Aquarius Mountains. This discontinuity is associated with Tertiary normal faults and may be an ancient strike-slip fault zone in the Precambrian rocks. Tertiary structures on the dome include relatively minor faults that pre-date the uplift of the dome and the dome itself, with its associated folds and faults. The dome is a structural dome. Its central part is a low, quaquaversal arch, now deeply eroded. Its edge is, in most places, a sharp monocline. Structural relief on the dome is estimated to be about 900 feet. Dips on the steep-dipping limb of the monocline, where it is sharp, vary from about 40 ° to about 90 °(?) and average about 66 °. Most faults mapped on the dome are confined to the vicinity of the monocline, partly as a result of poor exposure and lack of structural control in the deeply eroded central part of the dome. These faults have chiefly radial and tangential strikes and steep dips, where attitudes can be determined. Normal, dip-slip movement appears to have been dominant, although radial faults may have had a strike-slip component of movement. Block rotations are observed along relatively long faults. Ages of faults, where they can be determined, range from the beginning of uplift, which was signaled by deposition of the sedimentary breccia of One O'Clock Wash, to after the emplacement of the ash-flow tuff of the Fort Rock Creek Rhyodacite. Major offsets, however, appear to be confined to the times of emplacement of the various units of sedimentary breccia on the flanks of the dome including the sedimentary breccia of One OClock Wash, the sedimentary breccia of Noon Gorge, and a basal sedimentary breccia in the Old Stage Road Member of the Fort Rock Creek Rhyodacite. In addition to mapped faults on the rim of the crater, abundant small faults, with displacements of inches to tens of feet, and lenses of unmineralized, open breccia were formed during doming. These are most easily seen in the Precambrian rocks in the interior of the crater. Units of the Crater Pasture Formation older than the Fault Canyon flow are strongly uplifted and deformed on the dome, whereas the Fault Canyon flow and units of the Fort Rock Creek Rhyodacite are uplifted and deformed by much smaller amounts. Major Tertiary structures near the dome include two west- to northwest-trending normal faults, traceable for several miles, on which movement occurred both during and after emplacement of the Fort Rock Creek Rhyodacite. Rocks on the southern and southwestern sides of these faults moved up during emplacement of the Fort Rock Creek Rhyodacite but moved down in subsequent times. Major events in the Precambrian geologic history at the Fort Rock dome include deposition of volcanic and sedimentary rocks, metamorphism, intrusion of granites, probably at about 1725 million years before the present, re-metamorphism accompanied by intrusion of granites and granite pegmatites, probably at about 1695 million years before the present, uplift, strike-slip(?) faulting, which probably occurred prior to about 1400 million years before the present, and erosion. Major pre-volcanic events in the Phanerozoic geologic history at the dome include deposition of sedimentary rocks in times ranging from the Cambrian to the Mississippian, uplift, and erosion, in mid-Tertiary times. The first major events in the Tertiary volcanic history at the dome include the eruption of various ultramafic to intermediate flows, tuffs, and volcanic breccias of the Crater Pasture Formation. Subsequently, during the intrusion of a large body of magma at some depth beneath the surface, overlying Precambrian rocks and volcanic rocks were domed. Erosion of the dome occurred and was coincident with eruption of volcanic rocks south of the dome. The Fault Canyon trachybasalt flow was erupted next on the southwest flank of the dome; it apparently came from the magma beneath the dome. Uplift of the dome subsequently diminished and some collapse may have occurred. Eruption of the Fort Rock Creek Rhyodacite began at a large center in the Aquarius Mountains southwest of the dome following extrusion of the Fault Canyon flow. Ash flows, ash and block falls(?), and volcanic mudflows, all of rhyodacite composition, were emplaced. Ash-flow tuff buried most of the terrane around the Fort Rock dome. Some faulting accompanied emplacement of the Fort Rock Creek Rhyodacite. The basalt of Buttox Hills was later erupted on the southeast side of the dome. Ten miles east of the <b>dome,</b> the Peach <b>Springs</b> Tuff, of middle Miocene Age, was emplaced on the western flank of the Aquarius Mountains. The Mohon Mountain volcanics, of Trout Creek, followed. Late geologic history in the region includes formation of Basin and Range fault in Miocene to Pliocene times and cutting of the present Colorado River drainage, beginning in early to middle Pliocene times. The deep canyons of Trout Creek and other creeks south and southwest of the dome presumably were formed during the latter period of erosion. At the dome, erosion led to the carving of a crater-like depression on the dome. This depression is presently surrounded by volcanic rocks in the steep, dipping limb of the monocline on the edge of the dome. These rocks form a circular in-facing scarp, which is the rim of the depression. A mathematical model of doming is developed in this report. The Precambrian rocks underlying the Fort Rock dome are treated as a layer of viscous fluid. Below this layer is an inviscid magma. Intrusion of the magma into the layer of viscous fluid is modeled by applying an axisymmetric pressure distribution on the bottom of the layer. After the pressure is applied, a dome is created on the surface. This dome has a smaller amplitude than the arch created on the bottom of the layer by the intrusion. By examining layers of different thickness, h, relative to the radius, a, of the applied pressure distribution, it appears that a dome like the Fort Rock dome cannot be created unless h/a is near 1. In addition, for a cooling time of around 10 (4) years for the magma that caused uplift of the Fort Rock dome, an effective viscosity for the Precambrian rocks underlying the dome is calculated to be around 4 x 10 (20) poises. Planes of maximum shear generated in the model are consistent in attitude and sense of displacement with most faults mapped on the Fort Rock dome. Discrepancies that are observed can be explained in several ways. The history of doming predicted by the model is consistent with the history of doming at the Fort Rock dome. It includes an initial stage of accelerating uplift followed by lesser uplift or collapse upon formation of a vent for the magma. Uplift ceases upon crystallization of the magma...|$|R
