40|$|Purpose: We {{analyzed}} the prescriptions of alpha-blockers and phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE 5 Is) in the urology department {{as well as}} in other departments of the general hospital. Methods: We investigated the frequency of prescription of alpha-blockers and PDE 5 Is from 3 general hospitals from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009. For alpha-blockers, data were collected from patients to whom alpha-blockers were prescribed from among patients recorded as having benign prostatic hyperplasia according to the 5 th Korean Standard Classification of Diseases. For PDE 5 Is, data were collected from patients to whom PDE 5 Is were prescribed by the urology department and by other departments. Alpha-blockers were classified into tamsulosin, alfuzosin, doxazosin, and terazosin, whereas PDE 5 Is were classified into sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, udenafil, and mirodenafil. Results: Alpha-blockers were prescribed to 11, 436 patients in total over 3 years, and the total frequency of prescriptions was 68, 565. Among other departments, the nephrology department had the highest frequency of prescription of 3, 225 (4. 7 %), <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>cardiology</b> (3, 101, 4. 5 %), neurology (2, 576, 3. 8 %), endocrinology (2, 400, 3. 5 %), pulmonology (1, 102, 1. 6 %), and family medicine (915, 1. 3 %) departments in order.

MÉTODO: Foram estudados 135 pacientes coronariopatas acompanhados na Disciplina de Cardiologia da Universidade Federal de São Paulo - Escola Paulista de Medicina, no período {{de janeiro}} de 2000 a setembro de 2002, distribuídos em três grupos: Grupo 1 - 51 pacientes tratados clinicamente; Grupo 2 - 43 pacientes revascularizados sem circulação extracorpórea e Grupo 3 - 41 pacientes revascularizados com circulação extracorpórea. Foram controladas as variáveis sexo, idade, índice de massa corpórea e doenças associadas entre os grupos e foi realizada ultra-sonografia total de abdome em todos os pacientes, aos doze meses de tratamento (clínico ou cirúrgico), para verificar a existência de colelitíase. RESULTADOS: A prevalência de colelitíase encontrada nos grupos foi: Grupo 1 - 7, 84 %; Grupo 2 - 11, 62 % e Grupo 3 - 19, 51 %. Não houve diferença estatisticamente significante entre os grupos quanto à existência de colelitíase (p= 0, 248). CONCLUSÃO: Baseado neste estudo não se pode afirmar que o uso da circulação extracorpórea predisponha a maior prevalência de colelitíase. OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to clarify the relationship between cardiopulmonary bypass with the use of a heart-lung machine and gallstones in a short-term follow-up. METHOD: A total of 135 patients with ischaemic heart disease were included in this study. All were <b>followed</b> up <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cardiology</b> Department of Hospital São Paulo, Federal University of São Paulo. They were divided into three groups: Group 1 - 51 patients who were treated clinically; Group 2 - 43 patients who underwent coronary artery grafting bypass without cardiopulmonary bypass; and Group 3 - 41 patients who underwent coronary artery grafting bypass with cardiopulmonary bypass and the use of a heart-lung machine. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in relation to gender, age, body mass index or associated diseases (p< 0. 05). All the patients underwent ultrasound examination 12 months after beginning their cardiological treatment (clinical treatment alone or surgical plus follow-up). RESULTS: The prevalence of gallstones in the groups was: Group 1 - 7. 84 %, Group 2 - 11. 62 %, and Group 3 - 19. 51 %. There was no statistically significant differences between the groups (p = 0. 248). CONCLUSION: It was concluded that cardiopulmonary bypass does not appear to have a close relationship with gallstone formation one year after coronary artery bypass grafting.

40|$|Introduction: In {{the last}} years cardiac surgery for {{congenital}} heart disease (CHD) reduced dramatically mortality modifying prognosis, but, at the same time, increased morbidity in this patient population. Respiratory and cardiovascular systems are strictly anatomically and functionally connected, so that alterations of pulmonary hemodynamic conditions modify respiratory function. While very short-term alterations of respiratory mechanics after surgery were investigated by many authors, not as much works focused on long-term changes. In these subjects rest respiratory function may be limited by several factor: CHD itself (fetal pulmonary perfusion influences vascular and alveolar development), extracorporeal circulation (CEC), thoracotomy and/or sternotomy, rib and sternal contusions, pleural adhesions and pleural fibrosis, secondary to surgical injury. Moreover inflammatory cascade, triggered by CEC, can cause endothelial damage and compromise gas exchange. Aims: The project was conceived to 1) determine severity of respiratory functional impairement in different CHD undergone to surgical correction/palliation; 2) identify the most and the least CHD involved by pulmonary impairement; 3) find a correlation between a specific hemodynamic condition and functional anomaly, and 4) between rest respiratory function and cardiopulmonary exercise test. Materials and methods: We studied 113 subjects with CHD undergone to surgery, and distinguished by group in accord to pulmonary blood flow (group 0 : 28 pts with normal pulmonary flow; group 1 : 22 pts with increased flow; group 2 : 43 pts with decreased flow; group 3 : 20 pts with total cavo-pulmonary anastomosis-TCPC) <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Pediatric <b>Cardiology</b> and Cardiac Surgery Unit, and we compare them to 37 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. In Pediatric Pulmonology Unit all pts performed respiratory function tests (static and dynamic volumes, flow/volume curve, airway resistances-raw- and conductance-gaw-, lung diffusion of CO-DLCO- and DLCO/alveolar volume), and CHD pts the same day had cardiopulmonary test. They all were examined and had allergological tests, and respiratory medical history. Results: restrictive pattern (measured on total lung capacity-TLC- and vital capacity-VC) was in all CHD groups, and up to 45 % in group 2 and 3. Comparing all groups, we found {{a significant difference in}} TLC between healthy and group 2 (p= 0. 001) and 3 (p= 0. 004), and in VC between group 2 and healthy (p= 0. 001) and group 1 (p= 0. 034). Inspiratory capacity (IC) was decreased in group 2 related to healthy (p 32. Comparing group 3 and 2, the most involved categories, we found difference in VO 2 max and VE/VCO 2 slope (respectively p= 0. 02 and p< 0. 0001). We evidenced correlation between rest and exercise tests, especially in group 0 (between VO 2 max and FVC, FEV 1, VC, IC; inverse relation between VE/VCO 2 slope and FVC, FEV 1 and VC), but also in group 1 (VO 2 max and IC), group 2 (VO 2 max and FVC and FEV 1); never in group 3. Discussion: According with literature, we found a frequent impairment of rest pulmonary function in all groups, but especially in group 2 and 3. Restrictive pattern was the most frequent alteration probably due to compromised pulmonary (vascular and alveolar) development secondary to hypoperfusion in fetal and pre-surgery (and pre-TCPC) life. Parenchymal fibrosis, pleural adhesions and thoracic deformities can add further limitation, as showed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> correlation between group 3 and number of surgical intervention. Exercise tests were limited, particularly in group 3 (complex anatomy and lost of chronotropic response), and we found correlations between rest and exercise tests in all but group 3. We speculate that in this patients hemodynamic exceeds respiratory contribution, though markedly decreased...|$|R

Study Design: Cohort study. Place and Duration of Study: The {{study was conducted in}} the emergency department and cardiac care units of the Aga Khan University in 2006 - 07. Methodology: A total of 202 patients, who presented to the emergency room with chest pain, were given an initial ECG and troponin check.

Sensitivity and specificity, if initial workup was determined, keeping final assessment after cardiac workup as the gold standard. Results: Out of the 202 patients, 61. 9 % were males. Their mean age was 54. 05 + 13 years. Sixty eight percent were placed in the initial ACS group and 30. 7 % were placed in the initial non ACS group.
