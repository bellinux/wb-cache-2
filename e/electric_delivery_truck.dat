In 1946, with {{encouragement}} from photographer William Helburn, Forma {{embarked on a}} career as an agent/representative for photographers, including Helburn, Ben Somoroff and Arnold Newman, and later, cinematographers Laszlo Kovacs, Harold Becker, and Haskell Wexler.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) {{developed}} the first vehicle-to-grid aggregation system qualified by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). The system allows for owners of <b>electric</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>truck</b> fleets {{to make money}} by assisting in managing the grid frequency. When the electric grid frequency drops below 60 Hertz, the system suspends vehicle charging which removes the load on the grid thus allowing the frequency to rise to a normal level. The system {{is the first of}} its kind because it operates autonomously.|$|E

The hybrid electric tractors are the standard bulk <b>delivery</b> <b>truck</b> that the company uses for large deliveries. CCE plans to incrementally deploy 185 of the hybrid electric trucks across the United States and Canada in 2009, bringing their total number of hybrid <b>electric</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks</b> to 327, the largest such fleet in North America. The company has 142 small hybrid <b>electric</b> <b>delivery</b> vehicles on the road. The trucks are powered by Eaton Corporation's hybrid electric drivetrain systems.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the competitiveness of}} the latest generation of <b>electric</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks.</b> A new model that integrates routing constraints, speed profiles, energy consumption, and vehicle ownership costs is developed. The model {{is applied to the}} study the competitiveness of three commercial vehicles: a widely available conventional diesel truck and two brands of electric trucks. Scenarios and breakeven points are calculated and analyzed for a large number parameter combination. The results show that route feasibility, minimum fleet size, distance traveled, battery life, purchase costs, and planning horizon are among the most significant factors affecting commercial electric vehicle competitiveness...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{frequent}} stop-and-go operation and long idling periods when driving in congested urban areas, the electrification of commercial <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks</b> {{has become an}} interesting topic nationwide. In this study, environmental impacts of various alternative <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks</b> including battery <b>electric,</b> diesel, diesel-electric hybrid, and compressed natural gas trucks are analyzed. A novel life cycle assessment method, an environmentally-extended multi-region input-output analysis, is utilized to calculate energy and carbon footprints throughout the supply chain of alternative <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks.</b> The uncertainties due to fuel consumption or other key parameter variations in real life, data ranges are taken into consideration using a Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, variations in regional electricity mix greenhouse gas emission are also considered to present a region-specific assessment for each vehicle type. According to the analysis results, although the battery <b>electric</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks</b> have zero tailpipe emission, electric trucks {{are not expected to}} have lower environmental impacts compared to other alternatives. On average, the electric trucks have slightly more greenhouse emissions and energy consumption than those of other trucks. The regional analysis also indicates that the percentage of cleaner power sources in the electricity mix {{plays an important role in}} the life cycle greenhouse gas emission impacts of electric trucks...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper was to analyse the level and effectiveness of using <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks</b> and trucks in horticultural farms. The scope of the paper covers <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks</b> and trucks, which constitute the equipment of 60 agricultural farms, which produce vegetables and fruit, located on the territory of Świętokrzyskie and Małopolskie Voivodeship. The following, inter alia, was determined: annual use, yield, structure of transport works {{and the use of}} capacity. It was determined, inter alia, that in the vegetable farms there are more both <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks</b> and trucks per one farm than in the horticultural farms. The transport efficiency of vehicles in the vegetable farms is lower in comparison to vehicles in the horticultural farms. Keywords: <b>delivery</b> <b>truck</b> truck transport use ag...|$|R

Depending on the route characteristics, Electric Assist (EA) cargo bicycles may serve as an economically viable alternative to <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks.</b> The {{purpose of this paper}} is to compare the delivery route cost trade-offs between box <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks</b> and EA cargo bicycles that have the same route and delivery characteristics, and to explore the question, under what conditions do EA cargo bikes perform at a lower cost than typical <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks?</b> [...]...|$|R
