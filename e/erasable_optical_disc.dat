40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1995 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaThe Telemetry Data Distribution System (TDDS) {{solves the}} need to record, archive, and {{distribute}} sounding rocket and satellite data on a compact, user-friendly medium, such as CD-Recordable discs. The TDDS also archives telemetry data on floppy disks, nine-track tapes, and magneto-optical disc cartridges. The PC-based, semi-automated, TDDS digitizes, time stamps, formats, and archives frequency modulated (FM) or pulse code modulated (PCM) telemetry data. An analog tape or a real-time signal may provide the telemetry data source. The TDDS accepts IRIG A, B, G, H, and NASA 36 analog code sources for time stamp data. The output time tag includes time, frame, and subframe status information. Telemetry data may be time stamped based upon a user-specified number of frames, subframes, or words. Once recorded, the TDDS performs data quality testing, formatting, and validation and logs the results automatically. Telemetry data is quality checked to ensure a good analog source track was selected. Raw telemetry data is formatted by dividing the data into records and appending header information. The formatted telemetry data is validated by checking consecutive time tags and subframe identification counter values (if applicable) to identify data drop-outs. After validation, the TDDS archives the formatted data {{to any of the}} following media types: CD-Recordable (CD-R) Disc (650 megabytes capacity); nine track tape (180 megabytes capacity); and <b>erasable</b> <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> (499 megabytes capacity). Additionally, previously archived science data may be re-formatted and archived to a different output media...|$|E

40|$|The 1970 s and 1980 s saw {{the rise}} and rapid {{development}} of online textual databases, particularly those covering science and technology. Online patents files are amongst the most used of these databases, and are now accessed worldwide by both patent specialists and researchers. However, most online databases covering intellectual property are based on an original document or publication which includes highly meaningful drawings, chemical structures or diagrams. Until recently these have not been available in electronic format. The recent rapid advances in image handling and distribution technology, such as Document Image Processing (DIP), image extraction, CD-ROM, WORM <b>discs,</b> <b>erasable</b> <b>optical</b> <b>discs,</b> high speed laser printing, and the delivery of images over high speed telecommunications networks or by Group 4 fax, will enable {{the next generation of}} information products to be developed during the 1990 s. The ability to mix searchable text with corresponding images, held either locally or delivered online, will enable the benefits of the original printed document or product to be made available to users in an electronic format. Since images are such a key element in making the most effective use of patent information this will mean that patent information products will be amongst the first to experience this image handling revolution. This paper reviews some of the present developments in image handling, and speculates on what kinds of information tools might evolve during the decade. ...|$|R

5000|$|ISO {{images are}} {{another type of}} <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> image files, which {{commonly}} use the [...] file extension, but sometimes use the [...] file extension as well.

They also do not contain the control headers and error correction fields of CD-ROM or DVD sectors that raw disc images usually store. Their internal format follows the structure of an <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> file system, commonly ISO 9660 (for CDs) or UDF (for DVDs). The CUE/BIN and CCD/IMG formats, which usually contain raw disc images, can also store ISO images instead.|$|R
50|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>discs</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} used for storing music (e.g. {{for use in a}} CD player), video (e.g. for use in a Blu-ray player), or data and programs for personal computers (PC). The Optical Storage Technology Association (OSTA) promotes standardized optical storage formats. Although <b>optical</b> <b>discs</b> are more durable than earlier audio-visual and data storage formats, they are susceptible to environmental and daily-use damage. Libraries and archives enact optical media preservation procedures to ensure continued usability in the computer's <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> drive or corresponding disc player.|$|R
