40|$|It was {{of primary}} {{interest}} {{to examine the}} affective consequences of conformity to gender stereotypes, and to assess if <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> social approval and authenticity mediate the relationship between conformity and affect. Therefore, we utilized an Electronic Momentary Assessment methodology to capture University of Maryland students’ engagement in gender stereotypical behavior, and their emotional and social experiences during their daily social interactions. Counter to expectations, we found that regardless of one’s own gender, enacting gender prescriptions enhanced <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> authenticity and <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> social approval, and enacting proscriptions reduced <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> authenticity and <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> social approval. Enacting prescriptions predicted more positive affect and enacting proscriptions predicted a more negative affective experience. <b>Feelings</b> <b>of</b> authenticity and <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> social approval independently predicted <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> more positive affect. Overall, {{our findings suggest that}} irrespective of gender, engaging in desirable stereotypes has a number of social, personal, and emotional benefits...|$|R

Therefore, in a study of 174 victims of violent crimes, the relation between <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> revenge and {{posttraumatic stress}} reactions was investigated. <b>Feelings</b> <b>of</b> revenge were correlated with intrusion and hyperarousal but not with avoidance. <b>Feelings</b> <b>of</b> revenge explained incremental variance of intrusion and hyperarousal when the variance explained by victimological variables was controlled. The retaliation motive implied in <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> revenge did not account for the relation between <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> revenge and posttraumatic stress reactions. However, the relation was moderated by the time since victimization. Therefore, <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> revenge must presumably be regarded as a maladaptive coping reaction to experienced injustice, but not in the first period after victimization...|$|R
5|$|During {{his time}} as a student, Gaudí was able to study a {{collection}} of photographs of Egyptian, Indian, Persian, Mayan, Chinese and Japanese art owned by the School of Architecture. The collection also included Moorish monuments in Spain, which left a deep mark on him and served as an inspiration in many of his works. He also studied the book Plans, elevations, sections and details of the Alhambra by Owen Jones, which he borrowed from the School's library. He took various structural and ornamental solutions from nazarí and mudéjar art, which he used with variations and stylistic freedom in his works. Notably, Gaudí observed of Islamic art its spatial uncertainty, its concept of structures with limitless space; its <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> sequence, fragmented with holes and partitions, which create a divide without disrupting the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> open space by enclosing it with barriers.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> attainment and the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> loss at the same time.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} parental attachment, peer attachment, and subjective <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> emotional loneliness. Three alternative models were tested {{in a group of}} 440 graduating psychology students at Ghent University in Belgium. The first hypothesis explored the linear causal relationship between parental attachment, peer attachment, and <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> emotional loneliness. The second hypothesis tested the direct relationship between parental attachment and <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> emotional loneliness, and the third hypothesis examined the reciprocity between <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> emotional loneliness and peer attachment. Using Structural Equation Modeling, results showed that peer attachment mediates strongly between parental attachment and <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> emotional loneliness.

Once stabilized, the effects generally remain the same at a given depth, only worsening if the diver ventures deeper.|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates {{subjective}} {{states of}} awareness in memory for emotional information following Tulving's (1985) dual-memory {{model in which}} <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> 'remembering' (including specific recollection of the encounter with the item) index episodic memory and <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> 'knowing' (memory but without any specific recollection) index semantic memory. Rajaram's (1996) proposal that distinctiveness <b>of</b> processing increases <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> 'remembering' while fluency <b>of</b> processing increases <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> 'knowing' was examined. Seven studies utilising news stories with varying emotional content were conducted following the assumption that emotional content would increase both distinctiveness and fluency of processing (cf. Oschner 2000). If emotional information invokes greater distinctiveness of encoding, this {{would be expected to}} result in enhanced episodic encoding and increased 'remembering'; greater fluency of processing would be expected to result in enhanced semantic encoding and increased <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> 'knowing'. The studies broadly support the hypothesis that emotional news stories increased <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> 'remembering'; however, emotion did not systematically affect <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> 'knowing'. Earlier research using different materials found increased 'remembering' with enhanced distinctive/elaborative processing. Three studies manipulating depth of processing, level of attention at encoding and repeated study trials replicated these effects with both emotional and neutral news stories. Using news stories as a study material facilitates investigation of the hypothesis that conditions promoting learning (transfer to semantic memory) would lead to increased <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> 'knowing' (Conway, Gardiner, Perfect, Anderson & Cohen, 1997). This hypothesis was supported for both emotional and neutral stories. The viability of exploring memory awareness for stories varying in emotional content was demonstrated and the results support the view that emotional distinctiveness increases <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> remembering. It is argued that <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> remembering depend on both distinctive and fluent encoding processes. It is suggested that emotional fluency at the encoding stage makes emotional information more readily available for episodic encoding and thereby fosters <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> remembering...|$|R
40|$|Victimization and adolescents’ <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> {{insecurity}} {{in public}} transport. An exploratory {{study of the}} role of routine activities and lifestyles. Victimisation and fear of crime have increasingly gained attention in criminological inquiries and in policy. More recently studies pay attention to <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> unsafety with regard to public transport. However, young adolescents are often less studied. Therefore the present study aims at filling that gap by studying the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> unsafety on public transport of young adolescents andby studying the correlates <b>of</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> unsafety on public transport. Attention is paid to a cognitive, emotional and behavioural dimension, as is done in most studies of fear of crime. The study departs from the integrated routine-activity / lifestyle theory as framework. The results indicate that exposure to offenders on public transport routes has no effect on <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> unsafety, attractiveness of the target has a significant effect on <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> unsafety, while the effects of lifestyles is fully mediated by repeat victimisation on public transport. Repeat victimisation has the strongest direct effect on the three dimensions <b>of</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> unsafety...|$|R
