Its {{commander}} Min Aung Hla {{had set up}} camp {{about five}} marches away from Prome in order to gather intelligence. Unsure of the Arakanese strength, Bayinnaung plotted to lure the Arakanese {{to a place where}} he can ambush them. He sent five men pretending to be messengers from Prome, who informed the Arakanese command that Toungoo armies were still fighting Confederation forces north of the city, and that the Arakanese should attack the Toungoo armies from the rear. Armed with the misinformation, the unsuspecting Arakanese troops marched right into the trap, and were thoroughly routed by Toungoo muskets and artillery. Over 2000 were captured. Min Aung Hla and a few of his men barely escaped.|$|E
500|$|After a {{year and}} a half of touring, Rise Against reconvened at the Blasting Room to record their fourth album, The Sufferer & the Witness. The band members were {{dissatisfied}} with Richardson's contributions to Siren Song of the Counter Culture, as he produced a more polished and heavier album than their previous works. As a result, they decided to return to Stevenson and Livermore, whom they felt had accurately captured the punk sound they were going for on Revolutions per Minute. Unlike the stressful recording sessions for Siren Song of the Counter Culture, the band had a much more enjoyable time with The Suffer & the Witness, as they no longer sought the approval of Geffen executives. According to McIlrath: [...] "It went great, the songs just flowed out of us. There were really few questions and the song lyrics would <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> us, it went really well and everyone really liked them." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 2005, English actor Daniel Craig stated MGM and {{producers}} Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assured {{him he would}} get the role of Bond, and Matthew Vaughn told reporters MGM offered {{him the opportunity to}} direct the new film, but Eon Productions at that point had not approached either of them. A year beforehand, Craig rejected the idea of starring, as he felt the series had descended into formula; only when he read the script did he become interested. Craig read all of Fleming's novels to prepare for the part, and cited Mossad and British Secret Service agents who served as advisors on the set of Munich as inspiring because, [...] "Bond has <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the service and he's a killer. [...] You can see it in their eyes, you know immediately: oh, hello, he's a killer. There's a look. These guys walk into a room and very subtly they check the perimeters for an exit. That's the sort of thing I wanted." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Like a Virgin" [...] {{was written}} by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. The idea for the song {{originated}} when Steinberg was living at his father's vineyards in the Coachella Valley, and driving a red pickup truck one day. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Steinberg explained that the song was not written for Madonna or any female singer but was inspired by his personal experiences. At that time Steinberg had <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an emotionally challenging relationship, and he had met someone new. That inspired the lyrics for [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] about how he coped with the difficult situation. When he took the song to Kelly, they decided {{that it would be a}} sensitive ballad, however they could not decide how the word [...] "virgin" [...] would fit in it. Steinberg elaborated: [...] "I wasn't just trying to get that racy word virgin in a lyric. I was saying ... that I may not really be a virgin— I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people— but I'm starting a new relationship and it just feels so good, it's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I've never done this before, because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt." ...|$|E
500|$|Ball {{was born}} on April 22, 1881 in Grand Haven, Michigan. After his Major League career ended, {{he went on to}} coach the Baltimore Orioles (who were a minor league team at the time). It was there that he was {{assigned}} to train Babe Ruth, who had <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys. Ball described Ruth as [...] "the dumbest and yet the strongest player" [...] he had ever coached. The two remained good friends after Ruth broke into the Majors and even played a friendly game of bowling against one another in 1923 (with Ball edging out Ruth, winning four out of the seven games played). Ruth held Ball in great respect, and because of their close friendship in baseball, he eventually became a fan of the New York Yankees. In the 1950s, an annual bowling tournament held at the Newfield Alleys near Bridgeport, Connecticut was named after Ball in order to honor the city's famous inhabitant. On February 12, 1952, at the age of 71, his health severely deteriorated due to a heart ailment and he was rushed to Bridgeport Hospital, where he was placed on the danger list and visitors were prohibited from seeing him. Five years later, he died on October 15, 1957 and was interred at Mountain Grove Cemetery, Bridgeport.|$|E
500|$|In his 1908 autobiography, Barrington repeats a {{line from}} a first night review of his {{performance}} as Dr Daly in The Sorcerer: [...] "Mr Barrington is wonderful. [...] He always manages to sing one-sixteenth of a tone flat; it's so like a vicar." [...] Barrington {{went on to say}} that producer Richard D'Oyly Carte later came to see him, saying, [...] "...what's the matter? ...some one has <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the stalls to tell me you are singing in tune. [...] It will never do." [...] Barrington said that [...] "This pleased me so much that I have never sung flat since, except, of course, when I wished...." [...] Several contemporaries did find Barrington's singing occasionally flat, including Francois Cellier. Many years later, in her memoir, Ellaline Terriss wrote: [...] "...dear old Rutland scarcely ever did sing in tune – but how grand he was.... He had a beautifully clear diction and a marvellous sense of timing – and was one of the finest singers of the then popular topical songs that our stage ever knew." [...] Percy Hetherington Fitzgerald wrote of Barrington in his 1899 book, The Savoy Opera, [...] "His peculiar tranquil or impassive style has always exactly suited the characters allotted to him, and it would now be difficult to imagine a Savoy opera without him. However, Barrington's performance as Dr Daly impressed the critics and audiences, and he won a permanent place in D'Oyly Carte's company.|$|E
5000|$|He briefly {{attended}} Vanderbilt University, but {{dropped out}} in 1971 {{to pursue his}} passions for writing, recording and performing music. “A {{lot of it was}} uncontrollable—compelled without compulsion. I didn’t seek out to do this. It <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me,” Moore explained years later. “I had this music inside of me and I wanted to be a pop star.

500|$|O'Brien had <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{drama school}} {{when she was}} cast as Vicki; it was her first {{television}} acting job. Director Christopher Barry originally wanted Bernard Archard {{for the role of}} Bennett/Koquillion, but was not able to get him. Barry would later cast Archard in The Power of the Daleks (1966). The role went to Australian actor Ray Barrett, whom Barry had seen on TV and marked in his book of actors he wanted to remember, and so he [...] "dug him out of the book" [...] when the time came. Barrett played Bennett as a [...] "normal, straight human being" [...] so as not to give the ending away. To preserve the mystery, Koquillion was credited in the first episode as being played by [...] "Sydney Wilson"— a name made up by the production team in tribute to two of the creators of Doctor Who, Sydney Newman and Donald Wilson. This was the first instance of an alias being used in the credits in order to conceal a plot twist in Doctor Who; the practice would be employed later on to conceal the appearance of villains Davros and the Master. Tom Sheridan provided the voice of the space captain and also played the Sand Beast. He was originally scheduled to play one of the Didonians at the end, but for unknown reasons they were played by two uncredited extras, John Stuart and Colin Hughes.|$|E
500|$|Carey wrote [...] "Mine Again" [...] {{alongside}} producer James Poyser. The ballad has {{electronic keyboard}} notes, a rhythmic vinyl sound, and melodies from gospel and R genres. [...] "Stay the Night" [...] {{was produced by}} Carey and Kanye West, and samples a piano loop from Ramsey Lewis's 1971 cover version of [...] "Betcha by Golly, Wow". In the lyrics, the protagonist faces the dilemma of spending the night with an ex-lover, although he is in another relationship. [...] "Get Your Number" [...] samples the hook from British band Imagination's 1982 single [...] "Just an Illusion", and derives its production from [...] "'80s-esque synthesizers" [...] and computerized musical instruments. Lawrence Ferber from the Windy City Times described [...] "Shake It Off" [...] as a [...] "playful approach to bitterness—and, more specifically, a cheatin' bad apple", with lyrics such as [...] "I gotta shake you off / Just like a Calgon commercial". In an interview with Ferber, Carey described the track as her favorite from The Emancipation of Mimi: [...] "'Shake It Off' can apply to anything. Whatever personal dramas we go through, put that song on and you lose the anxiety or intensity of the moment. I'll listen to that song when I've <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an annoying meeting. I gotta shake this off." [...] Editor Jon Pareles from The New York Times felt that the album follows a formula that was most apparent on [...] "Shake It Off": [...] "On this album, the verses stay in a narrow range, the choruses glide higher, and {{at the ends of}} some songs, Ms. Carey gives herself a few of her old sky-high notes as a background flourish." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Shake It Off" [...] was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine picked [...] "Shake It Off" [...] as a top pick from the album. Michael Paoletta, writing for Billboard, gave the song a positive review, complimenting its lyrics, production and Carey's vocals. He concluded his review with his assurance that the song would be a success, writing [...] "After 'We Belong Together' {{brought her back to}} radio big time, 'Shake It Off' will take Carey's good fortune to the next step." [...] Some critics compared the song heavily to Usher's material from his 2004 album, Confessions. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote [...] "Mariah too heavily bites on the styles of her successors: Usher by way of Dupri on 'Shake It Off'," [...] while Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said the song was [...] "Usher-lite". Lawrence Ferber from the Windy City Times described [...] "Shake It Off" [...] as a [...] "standout" [...] track from the album. When discussing the track with Ferber, Carey described the song as her favorite from The Emancipation of Mimi: [...] "Shake it off can apply to anything. Whatever personal dramas we go through, put that song on and you lose the anxiety or intensity of the moment. I'll listen to that song when I've <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an annoying meeting. I gotta shake this off." [...] While Todd Burns from Stylus Magazine described it as [...] "sultry", a writer from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram called it [...] "lyrically crude" [...] and [...] "ghetto". Similarly, The Michigan Dailys Chris Gaerig criticized Carey's [...] "airy vocals" [...] and wrote [...] "Carey sounds like a 13-year-old boy going through puberty, singing love songs to a grade school crush." ...|$|E

When Nanavati met Prem at the latter's bedroom, Prem had <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the bath dressed only in a white towel; an angry Nanavati swore at Prem and proceeded to ask him if he intended to marry Sylvia and look after his children.

2500|$|A {{different}} {{tradition is}} first found in Josephus, who was read by Poussin and influenced {{his treatment of}} this and other biblical scenes. [...] His account of the finding has the princess [...] "playing by the river bank" [...] and spotting Moses being [...] "borne down the stream". She [...] "sent off some swimmers" [...] to fetch him. [...] Thus in Poussin's 1638 Finding in the Louvre a burly male emerges from the water with the child and basket, a detail sometimes copied by other painters. [...] This is followed in Sebastian Bourdon's painting of 1650, with two male swimmers. [...] Italian paintings more often show female swimmers, or at least females who have landed and are drying themselves after handing the baby to the princess, as in Sebastiano Ricci, Salvator Rosa, Giovanni Francesco Romanelli, {{as well as a}} painting in the Rijksmuseum by Paulus Bor and Cornelis Hendriksz Vroom from the 1630s, and Poussin's 1651 composition.

But we had <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an ambush and we were venting our distaste for the people who occupied those positions, so everyone applauded the dissolution." [...] "The way the provisional government abandoned the constitution produced a very strong reaction – it was a big mistake" [...] said Congressman Felipe Mujica, member of a socialist party that had broken with Chávez but been excluded from the new government. [...] "That, and the way they were pursuing his political allies, arresting them, created the impression that this was not the right way." [...] Such actions fragmented the broad anti-Chávez coalition which had supported the coup, with many viewing it as [...] "the triumph of a small oligarchic elite." [...] "Carmona was really placed in a trap" [...] Anibal Romero, a Venezuelan political science professor, told The Los Angeles Times. [...] "He couldn't leave the National Assembly in power and govern the country, because it was full of Chávez supporters. But if he dissolved it, he would be declared anti-democratic." [...] Another mistake was that, although he had spent months working closely with labour leader Carlos Ortega, he appointed no labor leaders to his cabinet.|$|E
