25|$|In June 1927, Birger {{was arrested}} {{on a charge of}} {{ordering}} the murder of Joe Adams. Birger allowed himself to be taken into custody without a fight. He had been arrested many times, and had always been released a few days later.

25|$|Shah Beg, however, {{seems to}} <b>have</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> {{in the long}} term it would be {{impossible}} to hold Kandahar against Babur. In 1520, in the hopes of establishing a new power base, he invaded Sindh, where the Samma dynasty was struggling under Jam Feroz. Shah Beg defeated Jam Feroz's army and proceeded to sack Thatta. The two sides agreed to a peace, where Shah Beg gained the upper half of Sindh (Thatta) while the Sammas retained the lower half (Bukkur). Jam Feroz almost immediately broke this agreement, but was defeated by Shah Beg and forced to flee to Gujarat. This marked the end of Samma rule in Sindh, as Shah Beg gained control of the whole region.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} {{purpose of}} the Chaco road system is shown {{by the presence of}} luxury items at Pueblo Bonito and elsewhere in the canyon. Items such as macaws, turquoise, marine shells, which are not part of this environment, in addition to imported vessels distinguished by design, prove that the Chaco had long-distance commercial relations with other distant regions. The widespread use of timber in Chacoan constructions was based on a large and easy transportation system, as this resource is not locally available. Through analysis of various strontium isotopes, archaeologists <b>have</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> much of the timber that composes Chacoan construction came from a number of distant mountain ranges, a finding that also supported the economic significance of the Chaco Road.|$|E
500|$|Fantastic Novels {{came into}} {{existence}} because of the demand from readers of Famous Fantastic Mysteries for book-length reprints. [...] Gnaedinger observed that [...] "Everyone seems to <b>have</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> although [...] set-up of five to seven stories with two serials running, was highly satisfactory, that {{the long list of}} novels would have to be speeded up somehow". [...] When the new magazine was launched, Famous Fantastic Mysteries was partway through serialization of Austin Hall and Homer Eon Flint's The Blind Spot, with the third episode appearing in the May/June 1940 issue. [...] Rather than complete the serialization, Gnaedinger printed the novel in its entirety in the first issue of Fantastic Novels, ensuring that readers of Famous Fantastic Mysteries would also acquire the new magazine. [...] Over the next four issues she printed Ray Cummings' People of the Golden Atom, Ralph Milne Farley's The Radio Beasts, and two novels by A. Merritt: The Snake Mother and The Dwellers in the Mirage. [...] Gnaedinger's interest in reprinting Merritt's work helped make him one of the better-known fantasy writers of the era.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} to launch Fantastic Novels was taken partly {{because there were}} a great many book-length works that readers wanted to see reprinted. [...] Gnaedinger commented that [...] "Everyone seems to <b>have</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> although [...] set-up of five to seven stories with two serials running, was highly satisfactory, that {{the long list of}} novels would have to be speeded up somehow". [...] When Fantastic Novels was launched, Famous Fantastic Mysteries was partway through serialization of The Blind Spot, by Austin Hall and Homer Eon Flint, with the third episode appearing in the May/June 1940 issue. [...] Rather than complete the serialization, Gnaedinger decided to print the novel in its entirety in the first issue of Fantastic Novels, ensuring that readers of Famous Fantastic Mysteries would also acquire the new magazine. [...] After Fantastic Novels ceased publication in 1941, Famous Fantastic Mysteries changed its policy, and began publishing a complete novel in every issue, rather than several stories and one or two serials running concurrently. [...] Usually there were also short stories, but occasionally a particularly long novel would appear alone in the issue: this happened, for example, with the February 1942 issue, which contained Francis Stevens' The Citadel of Fear, and no other fiction.|$|E

500|$|Back {{in jail in}} Glenwood Springs, Bundy {{ignored the}} advice of friends and legal advisors to stay put. The case against him, already weak at best, was deteriorating {{steadily}} as pretrial motions consistently resolved in his favor and significant bits of evidence were ruled inadmissible. [...] "A more rational defendant might <b>have</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> he stood {{a good chance of}} acquittal, and that beating the murder charge in Colorado would probably have dissuaded other prosecutors ... with as little as {{a year and a half}} to serve on the DaRonch conviction, had Ted persevered, he could have been a free man." [...] Instead, Bundy assembled a new escape plan. He acquired a detailed floor plan of the jail and a hacksaw blade from other inmates, and accumulated $500 in cash, smuggled in over a six-month period, he later said, by visitors—Carole Ann Boone in particular. During the evenings, while other prisoners were showering, he sawed a hole about one foot (0.30 m) square between the steel reinforcing bars in his cell's ceiling and, after losing , was able to wriggle through it into the crawl space above. In the weeks that followed he made a series of practice runs, exploring the space. Multiple reports from an informant of movement within the ceiling during the night were not investigated.|$|E
500|$|No Line on the Horizon {{received}} generally favourable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns {{a weighted}} average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on 30 reviews. David Fricke of Rolling Stone {{gave it a}} five-star score and called it [...] " [...] best, in its textural exploration and tenacious melodic grip, since 1991's Achtung Baby." [...] In his review for Blender, Rob Sheffield stated [...] "The days are gone when U2 were {{trying to keep it}} simple—at this point, the lads <b>have</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> over-the-top romantic grandiosity is the style that suits them, so they come on like the cosmic guitar supplicants they were born to be." [...] Uncut magazine's Andrew Mueller commented, [...] "It's U2's least immediate album—but there's something about it that suggests it may be one of their most enduring." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly graded it an [...] "A−" [...] and called the album [...] "an eclectic and electrifying winner, one that speaks to the zeitgeist the way only U2 can and dare to do." [...] BBC Music reviewer Chris Jones said, [...] "There's plenty to rejoice about here" [...] while noting that the [...] "symbiotic relationship with Brian Eno (and Daniel Lanois) seems to have reached the point of imperceptibility." [...] NME contributor Ben Patashnik called the album [...] "a grand, sweeping, brave record that, while not quite the reinvention they pegged it as, suggests they've got the chops to retain their relevance well into their fourth decade as a band." ...|$|E

These early successes may have encouraged Dresser to pursue songwriting rather than performing.

2500|$|However, Piave {{was not at}} all {{pleased by}} this turn of events and felt that an opera based on Hernani could not be staged for reasons of censorship. For instance, the King's first {{appearance}} in the play is from a cupboard where he has been hiding since some time after his arrival and before he meets Elvira. Thus he overhears much of the interaction between Elvira and Ernani before finally revealing himself. Verdi must <b>have</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> no king [...] "would ever be allowed to hide in a cupboard", something which Budden notes.|$|E
2500|$|Then in November 2011, priests at Eihei-ji held a {{symposium}} for 300 people called Cherish Our Lives: The Way of Living that We don’t Choose Nuclear Power Generation {{on the subject}} of denuclearization.

2500|$|These open-air sermons, {{mostly by}} Anabaptist or Mennonite preachers, {{spread through the}} country, {{attracting}} huge crowds, though not necessarily of those leaning to Protestantism, and in many places immediately preceded the iconoclastic attacks of August 1566. Prosecutions for heresy continued, especially in the south, although they were erratic, and in some places clergy of clearly heretical views were appointed to churches. By 1565 the authorities seem to <b>have</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> persecution was not the answer, {{and the level of}} prosecutions slackened, and the Protestants became increasingly confident in the open. A letter of July 22, 1566, from local officials to the Regent, warned that [...] "the scandalous pillage of churches, monasteries and abbeys" [...] was imminent.|$|E

[...] "At the end of the day, however, we <b>have</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> these factors cannot rigidly control, and we have come back to saying that the standards are 'fluid concepts that take their substantive content from the particular contexts' in which they are being assessed." [...] The best distinction might be that prior to conducting an evidence search, a law enforcement officer must have knowledge that raises a “fair probability,” or a “substantial chance,” of discovering evidence of criminal activity, while school officials need only a [...] "moderate chance" [...] of finding evidence of wrongdoing.|$|E
2500|$|When {{properly}} managed, dairy {{and other}} livestock waste, {{due to its}} nutrient content (N, P, K), makes an excellent fertilizer promoting crop growth, increasing soil organic matter, and improving overall soil fertility and tilth characteristics. [...] Most dairy farms in the United States are required to develop nutrient management plans for their farms, to help balance the flow of nutrients and reduce the risks of environmental pollution. [...] These plans encourage producers to monitor all nutrients coming onto the farm as feed, forage, animals, fertilizer, etc. and all nutrients exiting the farm as product, crop, animals, manure, etc. For example, a precision approach to animal feeding results in less overfeeding of nutrients and a subsequent decrease in environmental excretion of nutrients, such as phosphorus. In recent years, nutritionists <b>have</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> requirements for phosphorus are much lower than previously thought. [...] These changes have allowed dairy producers {{to reduce the amount}} of phosphorus being fed to their cows with a reduction in environmental pollution.|$|E
