40|$|Minimizing floor-to-floor {{heights in}} mid- to {{high-rise}} buildings {{is a concern}} held by both engineers and architects. Many {{attempts have been made}} in steel construction to adopt design philosophies that utilize structural floor members with high span/depth ratios. These designs, however, have been limited to floor systems that predominantly span in one direction. The primary objective of this thesis is to investigate the structural feasibility of interlocking open-web steel joists to form a panelized two-way steel floor system. This thesis includes a detailed discussion of the fabrication of the proposed floor system. A complete description of a proposed construction sequence is also presented. Finally, the structural behavior of the floor system is demonstrated under static loading. Conclusions were made discussing the benefits of this new system as well as recommendations for the direction of further investigation. ii Acknowledgements First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Chris Foley, for his time, guidance, and willingness to listen as my proposed floor system design evolved. <b>I</b> <b>wan...</b>|$|E
40|$|I want {{to seize}} this {{opportunity}} to thank every one who directly or indirectly helped me in completing this work. It {{is not possible to}} state all names nevertheless I feel indebted to all my teachers, friends, family members, university staff, neighbors and colleagues for their contributions in my work and my life. However, some names should be necessarily mentioned without those this work was not possible. First of all, I would like to express my heartiest gratitude to Dr. Brian Mark for his guidance, supervision and efforts during the last three years. His critique and assessment always helped me in improving my work and his consolation and support kept me from being frustrated and disappointed. Working with him was certainly a pleasure and a great rewarding opportunity. I am thankful to my committee members for their comments and analysis, though kept me awake for several nights, were surely vital to my work.

40|$|Why are {{the same}} {{intellectual}} battles fought over and over again? Why aren’t there arguments good enough to settle those debates once and for good? What are facts, situations, or events? When Situation Semantics {{was born in the}} eighties, I objected because I could not swallow the idea that situations might be chunks of information. For me, they had to be particulars like sticks or bricks. I could not imagine otherwise. The first manuscript of “An Investigation of the Lumps of Thought ” that I submitted to Linguistics and Philosophy had a footnote where I distanced myself from all those who took possible situations to be units of information. In that context and at that time, this meant Jon Barwise and John Perry. I eventually met Jon Barwise at a colloquium at MIT. When we had a drink together afterwards, he asked me: “Why did you put that footnote in your paper? ” I don’t remember what I replied, but Jon invited me to Stanford for a talk. I accepted the invitation. I have been ashamed about the footnote ever since. I took it out. It never made it into the printed version of my paper. However, I am sad that I was never able to pay back Jon’s generosity. <b>I</b> <b>wan...</b>|$|E

While I will take the blame for any errors in this text, I would at the very least like to thank by name some of those who made the last six years both enjoyable and fulfulling. For most of my graduate studies I have had both the blessing and the curse of having two academic advisors: Professors Fiona Harrison and Shri Kulkarni. Though stylistically quite different, I could not have asked for a better pair to match my temperment. Shri was a constant source of enthusiam, energy, and ideas, while Fiona was always there with a keen eye for detail and a vital sense of perspective. Because of them I was given the tools and support necessary to attack an interesting problem and the freedom to do so in my own unique way — no graduate student could ever ask for any more. In addition to Shri and Fiona, the entire GRB group at Caltech (and beyond) offered a stimulating working environment in which to pursue my research.

40|$|This poster {{presents}} {{a collaboration between}} UBC (University of British Columbia) and USLCES (the Upper St’át’imc Language, Culture, and Education Society) involving the documentation, transcription, analysis, and dissemination of three comprehensive collections of modern and heritage recordings of personal narratives in St’át’imcets (a. k. a. Lillooet), a highly endangered Interior Salish language spoken in British Columbia, Canada, spoken by approximately 50 elderly fluent speakers. The overall goals in producing these collections are (a) to provide the language community with quality learning materials; (b) to provide the linguistic community with accurate data; and (c) to build a legacy of literature in the language. Subject matter of the narratives includes traditional legends, childhood memories, historical events, stories remembered from parents, work experiences, among others. We present one finished volume, Sqwéqwel’ múta 7 sptakwlh (Stories and Legends) : St’át’imcets Narratives by Qwa 7 yán’ak (Carl Alexander) (UBC Occasional Papers in Linguistics, 2016), consisting of contemporary recordings of a fluent speaker of the Bridge River band. We also present two volumes which are nearly complete, St’át’imcets Narratives recorded by Jan van Eijk, and St’át’imcets Narratives recorded by Randy Bouchard (titles tentative), which stem from heritage recordings made during the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s. Volumes are published in both a low-cost hard copy format, and as a freely accessible electronic resource, including sound files, on the UBC Working Papers in Linguistics website. These projects approach stories about “everyday life” as valued contributions to {{a growing body of}} Interior Salish literature and linguistics (cf. Matthewson 2005, Matthewson et al, 2008). They include a wealth of linguistic material, including registers of speaking which are poorly represented in existing texts, and have also brought to light previously unattested lexical roots and derivations not found in dictionaries for the language (cf. van Eijk, 2013). The poster focuses on methodological issues surrounding transcription and translation techniques, typography and formatting, and the documentation and inclusion of place-name maps as part of the volumes. We discuss specific ways in which creating these materials involved the community (e. g. training community members in transcription/translation), and discuss ways in which these materials are being (and could be in the future) used in community-based language revitalization initiatives. This work has been made possible by a SSHRC (Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada) Partnership Grant titled “First Nations Languages in the Twenty-First Century: Looking Back, Looking Forward” which supports language documentation and revitalization efforts across British Columbia.
