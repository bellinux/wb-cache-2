5|$|Bradman had {{words with}} Barnes after this match {{about his new}} role as an opener. Barnes later wrote: He asked me how I liked it. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> suited me. 'You batted very well in this game,' he said, 'but not quite as an opener. You were looking for runs all the time. I think {{what you want to}} watch as an opener is not getting out... What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is {{patience}} and plenty of it.' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{comments}} he made {{suggesting that}} contracts for the mega-fight {{were close to}} being finalized, De La Hoya told BoxingScene.com on July 26, 2010: I think <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> because I get the question asked so many times that, obviously, I was fed up and tired of it and I just said like, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get made. So it was a quick answer that I should have obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on.|$|E
500|$|Finkelstein {{had made}} many {{criticisms of the}} Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement. Finkelstein stated that [...] "I think the {{solidarity}} movement has the right tactics. I support the BDS. But <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> will never reach a broad public until and unless they are explicit on their goal. And their goal has to include recognition of Israel, otherwise it's a nonstarter." [...] Elsewhere, he has stated that he supports a [...] "lowercase" [...] BDS, making the same point about tactics and goals.|$|E

500|$|One of Zoe's {{first and}} main storylines was being stalked by fellow student Will Hackett (Oliver Farnworth). Lister later {{commented on the}} storyline, {{deciding}} it was her most memorable: [...] "The most memorable for me {{was the one with}} my weird boyfriend Will who stalked me. Like <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>it</b> was a bit weird, but I quite liked it as a storyline." [...] During a fire safety promotion undertaken with co-star Lena Kaur, who plays Leila Roy, Lister referenced the storyline, commenting: [...] "It's much easier to test your smoke alarm once a week and plan your escape from fire than it is to escape from a psycho!".|$|E
500|$|During her latter {{years in}} EastEnders, Pauline is rarely without her Cairn Terrier, Betty. The dog is a stray {{taken in by}} the Fowler family in 2004, who quickly becomes Pauline's inseparable sidekick. Wendy Richard has since {{revealed}} {{that it was her}} decision for Pauline to own a Cairn: [...] "When EastEnders asked if Pauline should have a dog <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> had to be a Cairn Terrier—and Betty joined us! [...] She's wonderful, she loves me and I love her." [...] In the on-screen story, the dog is named after Pauline's aunt Betty, but in reality, Wendy Richard named her after Mollie Sugden's fictional character Betty Slocombe, who appeared along with Richard's Shirley Brahms in the sitcom, Are You Being Served? ...|$|E
500|$|Liam Cunningham, who portrays Davos Seaworth, {{spoke about}} {{the writing of the}} episode {{following}} its airing, and revealed how he reacted to the scene, saying [...] "It was initially shocking. You know what I thought was my favorite bit, and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> to David and Dan, it was at that moment when the reveal comes and you kind of go, 'Oh my God,' it puts things into context with Melisandre. It doesn't explain or blah, blah, blah. … It's confirmed like, she's a witch, but there was such a touch of humanity. When she went to the bed and got into the bed and covered herself up… it was like a really striking moment in this weird madness of humanity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} it's worth explaining. We have rather luxurious {{quarters}} at the hotel, but {{this room is}} somehow different. It's restful--I think it's homely--in fact, as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>it's</b> nice to be here." ...|$|R

500|$|The vocals of {{the album}} were {{recorded}} at Sarm East to a click track using a Roland TR-808 drum machine, and other various machines and boxes synced up the tracks. As Langan recalls: [...] "In those days of relatively limited technology we again had to push {{what we had to}} the limit... If, for instance, something required an effect, whether it be tape delay or phasing or some big, delayed reverb, the art was to get that effect right and record it... It all had to be done and then, as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>it</b> would influence the next process." [...] Langan has noted that balancing the backing vocals in the songs from the album was a major problem, due to no available terabytes of storage. He stated: [...] "We'd make it as clean as we possibly could, bounce that down to two tracks and then we'd erase." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, {{opposite}} Sacha Parkinson, {{who plays}} Sian Powers, Thompson filmed his first screen kiss. He {{said of the}} experience, [...] "It was bizarre because Sacha had done one before and I hadn't. I knew the line I had to say and then kiss her. I knew it every time, and every time <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> I was shaking." [...] He continued, [...] "Oh it was dreadful. I mean I don't get nervous when I go on stage or anything like that, {{but it was just}} bizarre. It {{was one of those things}} that I got really nervous about." [...] The on-screen romance was part of a controversial New Year's Eve storyline which featured the two characters attempting to see in 2010 by losing their virginities, only to be discovered by Ryan's adoptive mother Michelle. In May 2012, it was confirmed that Ryan would be recast and played by Sol Heras, because Thompson chose not to return.|$|E
500|$|According to the British Film Institute, [...] "Press Gang {{managed to}} be perhaps the funniest children's series ever made {{and at the same}} time the most painfully raw and emotionally honest. The tone could change {{effortlessly}} and sensitively from farce to tragedy in the space of an episode." [...] Although the series is sometimes referred to as a comedy, Moffat insists that it is a drama with jokes in it. The writer recalls [...] "a long running argument with Geoff Hogg (film editor on Press Gang) about whether Press Gang was comedy. He insisted that it was and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> wasn't– it was just funny." [...] Some innuendo leads Moffat to claim that it [...] "had the dirtiest jokes in history; we got away with tons of stuff... We nearly got away with a joke about anal sex, but they spotted it at the last minute." [...] In one episode Lynda says she's going to [...] "butter him up", and, when asked (while on a date in a hotel's restaurant) if he was staying at the hotel, Colin replies [...] "I shouldn't think so: it's only the first date." ...|$|E

"Why," [...] grinned Mr. Galer, [...] "you'll {{hardly believe}} it, sir, {{but he had}} the impudence, the gall, if I may use the word, the sauce to tell me he was in my own line of business. A detective, sir! Said he was going into the room to keep guard. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to him at the time, <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>it's</b> too thin, cocky. That's to say----" ...|$|R
500|$|The album's lyrics were {{frequently}} noted as being sarcastic, cynical, and occasionally memorable. [...] "Jehovah Made This Whole Joint for You" [...] {{was described as}} [...] "catchy but cynical" [...] by High Fidelity News and Record Review. Gerber from Consequence of Sound noted that the song discusses both religion and marijuana. [...] "Someday We'll Know" [...] lyrically explores numerous mysteries throughout history, including Amelia Earheart's disappearance, with the lyrics [...] "Whatever happened to Amelia Earhart? Who holds the stars up in the sky?" [...] The song also centers on Alexander's {{trying to figure out}} why his partner left him. [...] "I Hope I Didn't Just Give Away the Ending" [...] includes improvisation and only a piano and percussion for the first two minutes, and was noted in Song Means: Analysing and Interpreting Recorded Popular Song as [...] "strangely unfocused," [...] also noting that at the 3:18 point of the song, Alexander [...] "steps out of character" [...] with the lyric [...] "This may not be true, but <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> so you'd feel involved with the song;" [...] Spin commented that the song contains [...] "rangy slurs." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Eric B. Is President" [...] was {{released}} {{as the first}} single with [...] "My Melody" [...] as the B-side. It peaked at number 48 on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and number forty on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales. The track sparked debate on the legality of unauthorized sampling when James Brown sued to prevent the duo's use of his music. PopMatters' Mark Anthony Neal called it [...] "the most danceable hip-hop recording" [...] of 1986. According to Touré of The New York Times, [...] "It is Rakim's verbal dexterity {{as well as his}} calm, deep voice and dark tone that has made this song a rap classic: 'I came in the door/ <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> before/ I'll never let the mic magnetize me no more/ But it's bitin' me/ Fightin' me/ Invitin' me to rhyme/ I can't hold it back/ I'm looking for the line/ Takin' off my coat/ Clearin' my throat/ The rhyme will be kickin' it/ Til I hit my last note.'" [...] The second single, [...] "I Ain't No Joke", peaked at number 38 on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. Described as one of the album's [...] "monumental singles", Michael Di Bella wrote in the All Music Guide to Rock that [...] "Rakim grabs the listener by the throat and illustrates his mastery of the rhyming craft".|$|E
2500|$|Former New Zealand All Blacks wing Stu Wilson {{writes in}} the tribute book David Campese that, [...] "When asked by a {{television}} reporter if he {{was looking forward to}} mark Stu Wilson he replied, 'Stu who?'" [...] Campese responded in the same book by replying that, [...] "The story is true, but Stu misunderstood why <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>it.</b> I didn't say it because I was cocky. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> because I honestly did not know who Stu Wilson was. I was a nineteen-year-old boy from Queanbeyan. My background had been in rugby league, not rugby union." ...|$|E

"At {{first it}} was a love song to Anna (McCoy's then girlfriend), but it built stuff on top of it, - all of my love songs have been made with Anna in mind - but like <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>it's</b> grown from the {{original}} version. The song has gotten to flow in development, and doesn't feel so personal anymore." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Yeh, very liberally, very liberally", said Nixon. [...] "Remember, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was, if they, if {{they hit}} there, {{go back and}} hit it again.

2500|$|... "Woodward {{just showed}} up at the door and said he was in the area," [...] Joan Felt was quoted as saying in Kessler's book, which was {{published}} in 2002.

He asked if it was okay to have a martini with my father at lunch, and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would be fine." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Greaseman {{pseudonym}} originated {{while he}} was in college. [...] "In those days of top 40, everybody who was on the radio was 'cookin'; cookin' with the Temptations, cookin' Four Tops, that kind of thing. Which meant they were really rockin'. One day I said I was cookin' with heavy grease. It was my way of saying I was out-cookin' the other guys. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> enough times, so one day one of the other deejays referred to me as the Greaseman." ...|$|E

2500|$|Victor Kraft, {{his partner}} at that time, found Rock Hill. It had been {{designed}} by a local architect 20 years earlier.

2500|$|Halifax's account omits the {{dramatic}} pause and gives an additional reason: [...] "PM said I {{was the man}} mentioned as most acceptable. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would be hopeless position.
