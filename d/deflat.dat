These fields {{are located in the}} extreme northern portion o:r the Mojave Desert of California. The Dumont System contains ppaot 1 oally every known type of active sand dune. A majority or these dunes are complex; developed chiefly from simple longitudinal and transverse forms. Wind records obtained at Silver Lake, California, 30 miles to the south or the dune system, indicate {{that the majority of the}} dune build 1 ng winds are from the west, with secondary winds from the north and south. This same wind pattern is presumed to have existed during the format 1 ve period of the dune system. The system is essentially non-migratory, but does oscillate slightly due to changes in northerly and southerly winds. Origin of the dune system appears to be due to the <b>deflat</b> 1 on or Pleistocene deposits associated with Lake Manly in southern Death Valley. A minor amount of material has resulted from deflation of the smaller Lake Dumont in Silurian Valley. A minor amount of material has resulted from deflation of the smaller Lake Dumont in Silurian Valley. The Kingston Wash, which enters the valley from the east, was found to be important as an additional sand source. The dunes appear to be losing some sand to the east, but as the present this loss appears balanced by continued ingress of sand from the major source area...|$|E
