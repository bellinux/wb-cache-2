However, dry forming leads to direct contact between tool and workpiece surface which causes increasing friction and wear. This paper presents a methodology for realization of lubricant free deep <b>drawing</b> processes. <b>Dry</b> deep <b>drawing</b> of a rectangular cup is investigated by a numerical simulation. First numerical results reveal the necessity of modifying the tribological system in order to realize <b>dry</b> deep <b>drawing.</b> Basic tribological investigations reveal increasing friction and intensive wear under dry conditions. Therefore, tailored surfaces are developed to improve the tribological properties without lubrication. By laser structuring various micro features were fabricated on the tool surface. Furthermore, tungsten doped hydrogenated amorphous carbon coatings (a-C:H:W) were deposited on the tool using unbalanced magnetron sputtering. The tribological behavior of these surface modifications were researched by a ring-on-disc-tribometer. The wear mechanisms during the dry sliding process are discussed depending on the micro features and coatings. The obtained test results help building the basic concept for generating tailored surfaces and subsequently to realize lubricant free deep drawing...|$|R

40|$|Shallow-Water Equations are {{encountered}} in many applications related to hydraulics, flood propagation or dam break problems. This set of nonlinear hyperbolic equations models a fluid flow in a domain where {{the depth of}} the fluid is much lower than its horizontal dimensions. Usually, these equations are treated using Finite Difference, Finite Volume or Continuous Finite Element methods. In this paper, we develop a Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method to deal with the one-dimensional Shallow-Water Equations. Discontinuous Galerkin Methods are currently experiencing a vigorous development. Advantages of such methods include their high order of accuracy and their ease to handle complicated geometries. For Shallow-Water Equations, the goals of this work are on the one hand to preserve quiescent flows (and, more generally, steady-states) in the presence of bathymetric terms and, on the other hand, to handle accurately flooding and <b>drying.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on earlier ideas for Finite Volume Methods [1], we design a Discontinuous Galerkin Method that preserves flows at rest. We assess the scheme on various one-dimensional problems including subcritical and trancritical flows as well as cases with flooding and drying [2]. These tests confirm the stability of the scheme and its high accuracy. Moreover we present a generalization of the method to the two-dimensional case that we illustrate with some numerical results...|$|R

40|$|In today’s industry, waste {{prevention}} and an {{efficient use of}} resources are becoming more important due to economic and environmental requirements. Especially in forming processes such as deep drawing, a reduced use of lubricants is highly promising for saving resources and reducing production costs. Ultimately, the highest savings can be realised by a complete lubricant free deep drawing process - namely <b>dry</b> deep <b>drawing.</b> In this paper, a combined approach consisting of a new tool design for deep drawing in lubricant free applications and development of a protective tool coating is presented. The combination of macro and micro structuring of the tools and the protective coating ensure a stable process with a sufficiently wide process window under dry conditions. Since the friction in the flange area and die radius has the largest contribution to the drawing force, these parts of the tool will be adapted for the new tool design. In order to decrease the level of friction force in flange area for a given friction coefficient, the integral of the contact pressure over the contact area has to be reduced. This is achieved by macro structuring of the tool. The absence of lubricants in drawing die radius has to be compensated by tetrahedral amorphous carbon ta-C films, which combine low friction coefficients and anti-adhesive behaviour with a high hardness and wear resistance. The ta-C films can additionally be micro structured by Direct Laser Interference Patterning (DLIP) to further improve their tribological performance...|$|R

40|$|Avoiding {{negative}} effects of conventional lubrication in forming operations stimulates research on lubricant free forming processes. Increased friction and wear due to direct contact between tool and workpiece surface lead to insufficient forming results in dry forming operations. <b>Dry</b> deep <b>drawing</b> of rectangular cups with conventional tools reveals cracks and wrinkles. This necessitates the development of tool sided surface modifications which face the challenges of lubricant free forming. As former results of tribological investigations have shown, adhesion is the dominant friction and wear mechanism. Therefore, diamond-like carbon coatings are applied to decrease adhesion. The mechanical properties of a-C:H:W- and ta-C-coatings are systematically analyzed to reduce friction and wear. Additionally, micro features are generated by laser texturing of a-C:H:W coatings to control material flow by locally adapted frictional conditions. The effects of different feature edge geometries and the feature orientation are investigated in ring-on-disc tribometer tests. Depending on the deposition parameters some a-C:H:W coating variants show reduction of adhesion for DC 04. However, in contact with aluminum alloys no improve of tribological conditions could be achieved. ta-C coatings affect the reduction of friction and wear in contact with DC 04 and aluminum and show high potential for application in dry forming processes. Depending on adhesion affinity of the workpiece material, micro features can increase friction by adjusting their edge geometry, orientation and area coverage. The tribological behavior of selected surface modifications is finally analyzed in the strip drawing test. The obtained results gain basic knowledge for development of surface modifications towards realization of lubricant free deep drawing by a tailored tool concept...|$|R
