25|$|We {{know that}} our {{consciousness}} inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena. Yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body. Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion. We usually {{are not aware of}} the breathing of our lungs or the beating of our heart unless somehow our attention is called to them. Our ability to control either is limited. Our kidneys command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose. <b>Few</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have any idea what our liver is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys. The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs. These organs have an agenda the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.|$|E

Then came Elizabeth David, like sunshine."

500|$|Positions on genetic {{determinism}} often {{correlate with}} social politics, and <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are neutral or even changeable on the issues. Wade recognizes that his ideas {{may not be}} acceptable to everyone but warns that [...] "to falter in scientific inquiry would be a retreat into darkness". He seems to be warning, appropriately enough, against benighted political correctness. But we should never become casual about how comparable [...] "slopular" [...] science and very similar speculative evolutionary reasoning by leading scientists fed a venomous kind of darkness not too many decades ago. Wade's post-hoc tales often put him in step with a long march of social darwinists who, with comfortable detachment from the (currently) dominant culture, insist that we look starkly at life in the raw and not blink at what we see.|$|E
500|$|Carl's {{relationship}} with Russell reflects how [...] "he's not really {{ready for the}} whirlwind that a kid is, as <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are". Docter added he saw Up as a [...] "coming of age" [...] tale and an [...] "unfinished love story", with Carl still dealing {{with the loss of}} his wife. He cited inspiration from Casablanca and A Christmas Carol, which are both [...] "resurrection" [...] stories about men who lose something, and regain purpose during their journey. Docter and Rivera cited inspirations from the Muppets, Hayao Miyazaki, Dumbo, and Peter Pan. They also saw parallels to The Wizard of Oz and tried to make Up not feel too similar. There is a scene where Carl and Russell haul the floating house through the jungle. A Pixar employee compared the scene to Fitzcarraldo, and Docter watched that film and The Mission for further inspiration. The character Charles Muntz comes from Howard Hughes and Errol Flynn.|$|E

500|$|Wayne Pommen, the first-choice Cambridge bow, {{was injured}} {{two days before}} the race, {{fracturing}} his wrist following a full-speed collision with the harbourmaster's launch during a practice start. [...] Matthias Kleinz was hit on the head but did not require medical attention. Cambridge number seven James Livingston said: [...] "For a couple of seconds I thought I was going to die. [...] We were going flat out {{and all of a sudden}} I heard Jim's voice. [...] I've never heard so much fear in anybody's voice before." [...] Pommen was circumspect: [...] "A <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were feeling quite lucky last night... at the same time, it was very frustrating and disappointing... but there was no point sulking in the corner." [...] Three oars were destroyed and two riggers bent; the boat was sent to Weybridge to be repaired. [...] Pommen was replaced by Ben Smith, brother of the Oxford stroke Matthew. [...] Not since the 1979 race had such a late change in the line-up of a crew been made. Along with James and David Livingston, this was the first time in the history of the Boat Race that two pairs of brothers would be racing against one another.|$|E
500|$|Desperate for a break, the overworked band {{began to}} argue and {{tensions}} formed. Raynor, {{who was at}} the center of this drama, had been commenting of his desire to attend college for years, and had been taking homework out with him on tour to try and complete his high school diploma. The tension came to a head in February 1998 as the band embarked on SnoCore, described as [...] "a winter version of the Warped Tour." [...] Sharing the stage with Primus, the band was enjoying more success than ever before, but the drama between the musicians had grown substantially. The band reached a low point when the band engaged in a fight on a Nebraska date after SnoCore's conclusion. Raynor would depart following SnoCore, and the ensemble recruited Travis Barker, drummer for the opening ska punk group The Aquabats, to fill in for Raynor. Barker, who had not had time to prepare or practice with the duo, learned the drum tracks for the 20-song setlist in only 45 minutes before the first show and performed them flawlessly thereafter. [...] "I remember Travis rehearsing backstage for an hour or two, then playing with them during sound-check," [...] said Adam Deibert of the Aquabats. [...] "A <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were standing behind the stage and vividly remember the feeling of this is the new Blink. We should have looked for a new drummer right then because it was obvious what band he belonged in." [...] Shortly thereafter, the band embarked on a short minitour along the western coast, most notably Southern California, the band's favorite place to play. The tour ended with the band headlining a sold-out show at the Palladium in Hollywood, California, where the band had dreamed of performing at for years. [...] Raynor returned for the band's Palladium performance, but the band became increasingly uneasy and arguments grew worse. To offset personal issues and a [...] "tragic loss," [...] Raynor began to drink heavily and it began to affect the band's performances.|$|E
500|$|In October 1971, Dyer {{accompanied}} Bacon to Paris for {{the opening}} of the artist's retrospective at the Grand Palais. The show was the high point of Bacon's career to date, and he was now being described as Britain's [...] "greatest living painter". Dyer was now a desperate man, and although he was [...] "allowed" [...] to attend, he was well aware that he was [...] "slipping", in every sense, out of the picture. To draw Bacon's attention he earlier planted cannabis in Bacon's flat, then phoned the police, and he had attempted suicide on a number of occasions. Dyer committed suicide, via an overdose of barbiturates, {{on the eve of the}} Paris exhibition in their shared hotel room. Bacon spent the following day surrounded by people eager to meet him. In mid-evening he was informed that Dyer had taken an overdose of barbiturates and was dead. Though devastated, Bacon continued with the retrospective and displayed powers of self-control [...] "to which <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> could aspire", according to Russell. Bacon was deeply affected by the loss of Dyer, and he had recently lost four other friends and his nanny. From this point on, death haunted his life and work. Though he gave a stoic appearance at the time, he was inwardly broken. He did not express his feelings to critics, but later admitted to friends that [...] "daemons, disaster and loss" [...] now stalked him as if his own version of the Eumenides. Bacon spent the remainder of his stay in Paris attending to promotional activities and funeral arrangements. He returned to London later that week to comfort Dyer's family. The funeral proved to be an emotional affair for all, and many of Dyer's friends, including hardened East-End criminals, broke down in tears. As the coffin was lowered into the grave one attendant screamed [...] "you bloody fool!". Although Bacon remained stoic throughout, in the following months Dyer preoccupied his imagination as never before. To confront his loss, he painted a number of tributes on small canvasses and his three [...] "Black Triptych" [...] masterpieces.|$|E

2500|$|Upon release, Record Mirror {{reviewed}} Slade in Flame and commented: [...] "Because Flame {{is set in}} the 1960s, {{the album}} has a distinctive 1960's flavour, which should take a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> hopping down memory lane. Because the songs have been taken out of context, a few of them have lost their charm and meaning but nevertheless, it is an enjoyable elpee." [...] In 1976, Record Mirror would voted the album No. 5 on their list of the Top 10 best albums of 1975. Disc said: [...] "This is the album from Slade's debut film. The group that's playing is not supposed to be them but the music included here certainly sounds like the Slade we all know and love. Only occasionally, do they stray from the usual mould. A touchy album but definitely more good than bad." ...|$|E
