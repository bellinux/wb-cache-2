5|$|TGS with Tracy Jordan head writer Liz Lemon is {{due for a}} root canal. To avoid feeling lonely on Valentine's Day, she {{schedules}} her {{surgery for}} that day, but soon realizes she will need someone to escort her home from the dentist's office due to the aftereffects of anesthesia. She asks her colleagues at the 30 Rock building for a ride home, {{but all of them}} have Valentine's Day plans and cannot help. When Liz calls the dentist's office to say she does not <b>have</b> <b>anyone</b> to pick her up, the receptionist (Shinnerrie Jackson) informs her that after her procedure she can only leave alone if she signs a liability waiver. Liz initially intends to sign the document, but is dissuaded at a party by musician Jon Bon Jovi, and instead decides to claim to the receptionist that she has a ride home after all.|$|E

Dan loved Maddy sincerely which is why he didn't want to risk hurting her [...] than he already had. He was too messed up to be good for anyone and he knew it." ...|$|E

500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{was pleased}} that the writers decided to let her {{character}} discover Walter's secret, commenting [...] "Astrid finds out in a really emotional way because Walter lets it slip to her accidentally. I {{think that it was}} really nice for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At least she knows that she's a part of this family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has {{to step up to the}} plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't <b>have</b> <b>anyone</b> there, he's basically going to regress and go back to the place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution. And of course we don't want that." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Cherry on Top" [...] {{was released on}} 20 April 2014. It was directed by frequent collaborator Duncan Winecoff while the cinematography was headed by Jake Saner. Casting calls for the video began in January 2014 as filming was scheduled to start on February 8 and end on February 10. Shot inside a ballet studio, Oh Land assumes {{the role of a}} substitute piano player who was hired by the studio's instructor (Helena Christensen). It {{tells the story of a}} male ballet dancer (Drew Minard) who works hard in order to receive the career of his dreams, although [...] "he didn't <b>have</b> <b>anyone</b> to share it with" [...] because he was overly determined. According to Winecoff, he would like to expand the video into a series of [...] "three short films" [...] with [...] "Cherry on Top" [...] serving as the very first one; he also said that over time [...] "a larger storyline will emerge, having much to do with dance, music, love and the power of the human spirit". However, no other films from the planned series have been created.|$|E
500|$|Filmmaker Walt Disney {{himself had}} first {{attempted}} {{to adapt the}} Brothers Grimm fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel" [...] into a feature-length animated film during the 1930s. However, he abandoned the project because the story was considered too [...] "small." [...] When they were approached to direct Tangled in 2008, directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard decided {{that it would be}} best to update the story [...] "for a modern audience", soon discovering [...] "that the problem with having a prison character ... is that they don't <b>have</b> <b>anyone</b> to talk to." [...] Howard explained that because Rapunzel is incapable of having a decent conversation with Mother Gothel, the isolated, incarcerated heroine [...] "needed someone to relate to." [...] Unwilling to default to using the traditional [...] "boring, ordinary side-kick," [...] Greno and Howard created Pascal, conceiving the character as a chameleon because Rapunzel is, according to Greno, [...] "a rough-and-tumble girl." [...] Howard explained that [...] "we wanted to do ... something fresh, something different. This girl, she's not a dainty, precious girl ... So what would she have? ... She's going to have a lizard." [...] Additionally, Howard believed that a reptile would compliment Rapunzel's personality best, describing the character as [...] "a quirky pet for a quirky young woman." ...|$|E

500|$|Film critic Roger Ebert {{enjoyed the}} film, dubbing it a [...] "Twilight for boys" [...] and saying [...] "as {{a movie about}} a flesh-eating cheerleader, it's better than it has to be". Ebert said that within Cody there is [...] "the soul of an artist, and her {{screenplay}} brings to this material a certain edge, a kind of gleeful relish, that's uncompromising. This isn't your assembly-line teen horror thriller". Additionally, he complimented Fox as [...] " [...] through" [...] in her portrayal and [...] "play the role straight". He gave the film {{three out of four}} stars. [...] Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail gave the film three out of four stars. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone stated it is [...] "Hot! Hot! Hot!" [...] and that [...] "Director Karyn Kusama is torn between duty to female empowerment and slasher convention". He credited Fox's portrayal as showing [...] "a comic flair" [...] that Transformers [...] "never investigated". Tom Charity of CNN said [...] " [...] last time a horror flick tried for a distinctly female point of view the result was Twilight, which was more of a wan gothic romance than a chiller" [...] and [...] "Fox makes a convincing vixen, callously picking up victims whenever her luster begins to fade. It's not hard to imagine she can <b>have</b> <b>anyone</b> who takes her fancy". Charity credited the dialogue as [...] "bitingly smart, funny teen-speak ...along with sharp pop culture references".|$|E

2500|$|The series' basic {{structure}} {{revolved around the}} trio, always short of money, offering themselves for hire [...] with the tagline [...] "We Do Anything, Anytime, Anywhere" [...] to perform all sorts of ridiculous but generally benevolent tasks. [...] Under this loose pretext, the show explored all sorts of off-the-wall scenarios for comedic potential. Many episodes parodied current events, such as an episode where the entire black population of South Africa emigrates to Great Britain to escape apartheid. [...] As {{this means that the}} white South Africans no longer <b>have</b> <b>anyone</b> to exploit and oppress, they introduce a new system called [...] "apart-height", where short people (Bill and a number of jockeys) are discriminated against.|$|E
2500|$|The {{intended}} {{follow-up to}} [...] "Just My Imagination" [...] was [...] "Smiling Faces Sometimes", on which Kendricks sang lead. When Kendricks left, they released, instead, [...] "I'm The Exception to the Rule", {{a song in}} the same vein (featuring Kendricks, Otis Williams and Edwards on lead) which follows [...] "Just My Imagination" [...] on the album. Unable to promote the song because they did not <b>have</b> <b>anyone</b> to do his parts in concert, the song failed miserably so the company pushed the [...] "B-side" [...] – the group's re-recording of [...] "It's Summer", initially the B-side of [...] "Ball of Confusion", at the last-minute, and Norman Whitfield had The Undisputed Truth record [...] "Smiling Faces Sometimes", for whom it was a major hit.

2500|$|In 2010 Gauci formed Tune in Tokyo, an electro-pop {{and dance}} music band, with {{producer}} Paul Brandoli. As the group's lead singer, Gauci's look and sound had changed.

Gauci explained, [...] "That's where I {{came out of my}} shell. I didn't <b>have</b> <b>anyone</b> telling me what to do. Tune in Tokyo is just one part of what I want to do. We got a lot of feedback straight away, which was great because it gave me confidence about the project". On 4 November 2010 they released their debut single, [...] "Dreamer", which peaked at No.3 on the ARIA Clubs Chart. It was co-written by Brandoli and Gauci. She revealed that she was working on the group's debut album and that she had made a cameo for a 2011 film, Big Mamma's Boy, which stars actress, Holly Valance. Tune in Tokyo's second single, [...] "Ray of Love", appeared in April 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Stevens filed a brief dissent. Though {{he agreed}} with the majority’s {{determination}} that a supervisor may take corrective action against [...] "inflammatory or misguided" [...] speech, he questioned whether the same logic applies against [...] "unwelcome speech" [...] that [...] "reveals facts that the supervisor would rather not <b>have</b> <b>anyone</b> else discover." [...] Citing Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District (1979), Justice Stevens emphatically disagreed {{with the notion that}} there was a categorical difference between speech uttered by a citizen or by an employee {{in the course of his}} duties. In Givhan, ruling on the issue of an English teacher voicing concerns to the principal about the school’s racist employment practices, the Court did not evaluate whether these concerns were raised in accordance with her job duties. Consequently, “our silence ...demonstrates that the point was immaterial.” Stevens added that it would be senseless for the constitutional protection of same words to be contingent on whether they are uttered as part of one’s job duties; additionally, it would be “perverse” for the Court to essentially create an incentive for employees to bypass their employer-specified channels of resolution and voice their concerns directly to the public.|$|E
2500|$|Queen Victoria {{was also}} against the match. No British prince had ever married a Romanov, and she foresaw {{problems}} with Maria's Orthodox religion and Russian upbringing. The Queen considered that Russia was generally [...] "unfriendly" [...] towards Britain. Victoria was also suspicious about Russian {{moves in the}} direction of India. The Queen was dismayed, therefore, when she heard that official negotiations had restarted in January 1873. There were rumours going about St Petersburg that Maria Alexandrovna had compromised herself with Prince Golitsyn, the Tsar's aide-de-camp, and her family were anxious to see her settled. Alfred refused to believe those rumours and he was prepared to fight to marry the person he loved. Queen Victoria therefore swallowed her pride and said nothing. Both mothers continued to look for other partners for their children, but Alfred and Maria would not <b>have</b> <b>anyone</b> else. As the Tsarina failed to find a German prince acceptable for her daughter, a meeting among Alfred, the Tsarina and her daughter took place in Sorrento, Italy in mid April 1873. That year, there was an Anglo-Russian dispute [...] over the Afghan border. The Queen’s ministers thought that a marriage might help to ease the tension between the two countries, if only by putting the monarchs into closer contact with one another.|$|E
