5|$|On Victoria Day, 24 May 1881, the {{stern-wheeler}} ferry SS Victoria capsized in the Thames River {{close to}} Cove Bridge in West London. Approximately 200 passengers {{drowned in the}} shallow river, {{making it one of}} the worst disasters in London's history, and is now dubbed 'The Victoria Day Disaster'. At the time, London's population was relativity low, therefore it was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> person in the city who did not have a family member affected by the tragedy.|$|E
5|$|Rachel Larris, who {{has also}} {{conducted}} an academic study of The Daily Show, disputes the findings of Baumgartner and Morris. Larris argues that the study measured cynicism in overly broad terms, {{and that it would}} be extremely <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> causal link between viewing The Daily Show and thinking or acting in a particular way. Bloggers such as Marty Kaplan of The Huffington Post argue that so long as Stewart's comedy is grounded in truth, responsibility for increased cynicism belongs to the political and media figures themselves, not the comedian who satirizes them.|$|E
5|$|Around 1923, Zobel's filter {{designs were}} {{reaching}} {{the peak of}} their complexity. He now had a filter section {{to which he had}} doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all the advantages of the previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the stop-band and an even more constant characteristic impedance in the pass-band. At the same time one side would match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the k-type. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better end matching half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best that could have been achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with conventional LC technology. Certainly, it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> textbook from any period which covers their design.|$|E

25|$|After the {{dissolution}} of Soviet Union and the switch to the market economy, Russian authors now had to struggle with unfamiliar realities of a free publishing system. The hopes of a creative boom never materialized, as publishers were eager to exploit the lucrative pulp literature market (virtually nonexistent before) largely ignoring the existing literature establishment. This led to rather low confidence in domestic authors, and it was extremely <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> publisher ready {{to invest in a}} local writer.|$|E

25|$|A poet of {{the last}} {{generation}} before the Islamic Revolution worthy of mention is Mohammad-Reza Shafiei-Kadkani (M. Sereshk). Though he is from Khorassan and sways between allegiance to Nima Youshij and Akhavan Saless, in his poetry he shows the influences of Hafiz and Mowlavi. He uses simple, lyrical language and is mostly inspired by the political atmosphere.

25|$|The 38 m-high belfry {{was fully}} erected between 1941 and 1943 by {{architect}} Stefan Venedict Popow, the domes took their current {{appearance in the}} period, steam heating was installed {{and the construction of}} the roof was changed as well. It was initially very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> contractor to sponsor the repairs, as well as the securing and transportation of materials.

25|$|The Alternative Service Book 1980 (ASB) was {{the first}} {{complete}} prayer book produced by the Church of England since 1662. Its name derives {{from the fact that}} it was proposed not as a replacement for the Book of Common Prayer (BCP) but merely as an alternative to it. In practice, it was so popular that the various printers had to produce several editions very quickly and churches which retained the BCP drew attention to this fact as something to be noted. The Prayer Book Society was soon complaining that it was becoming <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> church which used the old prayer book and that theological colleges were not introducing students to it. It has now been replaced by Common Worship.|$|E

[...] Contactmusic's Banimaer stated that although the track is a little repetitive, it shows what kind of band Maroon 5 wants to be.|$|E
500|$|The {{democratic}} era {{has been}} {{a time of great}} change, both constructive and destructive, for the aborigines of Taiwan. Since the 1980s, increased political and public {{attention has been paid to}} the rights and social issues of the indigenous communities of Taiwan. Aborigines have realized gains in both the political and economic spheres. Though progress is ongoing, there remain a number of still unrealized goals within the framework of the ROC: [...] "although certainly more 'equal' than they were 20, or even 10, years ago, the indigenous inhabitants in Taiwan still remain on the lowest rungs of the legal and socioeconomic ladders". On the other hand, bright spots are not <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find.</b> <b>A</b> resurgence in ethnic pride has accompanied the aboriginal cultural renaissance, which is exemplified by the increased popularity of aboriginal music and greater public interest in aboriginal culture.|$|E

When reading the comic for the part, Morgan stopped when he saw his character was killed off three pages in. When telling his agent {{he did not want}} the part, he was told to continue reading it and find out how important his character was. Morgan found the role a challenge, explaining, [...] "For some reason, in reading the novel, you don't hate this guy even though he does things that are unmentionable.

500|$|... "Worst Episode Ever" [...] {{was written}} by Larry Doyle and {{directed}} by Matthew Nastuk. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on February4,2001. The episode was originally called [...] "The Fiver", {{a reference to a}} scene in the episode that was eventually removed. The episode title was then changed to [...] "Worst Episode Ever", a title which the staff were amused by. According to Doyle, [...] "Worst Episode Ever" [...] is the first episode in which Comic Book Guy has a major role. Because Comic Book Guy is usually sarcastic and unfriendly, the series' staff found it hard to make the character seem likable. For example, Hank Azaria, who plays Comic Book Guy among other characters in the series, had a difficult time trying to make the character sound sincere. [...] "Comic Book Guy only ever pronounces things sarcastically", Azaria said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "It was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way to sound believable and have him say sincere things. It took a lot of different takes." [...] Executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully said, [...] "It's tough when you take a character like Comic Book Guy or Krusty or Moe, to make them suddenly sympathetic and vulnerable. You have to cheat the character a little bit to open them up emotionally a little more." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff {{has stated}} that {{starting}} from the album The Painful Experience they incorporated their own approach to record drum tracks in the studio which they call [...] "hybrid drums", a mix of real-time performance and software-based matrix programming. He also mentioned the efficiency of using the hybrid drumming compared with getting a drummer: [...] "About the drummer, it is still very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> right drummer because Kekal music is ranging from very extreme-metal with blast beats and fast double-kicks, to powerful rock beats that demand steady tempo, and to some polyrhythmic playing and time-signature shifts in the characteristics of jazz and prog drumming. We would need 2 or 3 kinds of drummer for Kekal. That's why {{the best thing for}} the recording is to make the hybrid drumming." [...] In other interview, Jeff mentioned the process of recording of The Habit of Fire, starting from collecting samples and creating MIDI information, then manipulating the sounds to create what he called the 'skeleton'. Then riffs, MIDI-triggered instruments, synthesizers, and melodies would be added and the structure re-arranged once again. Once the song structure was set, the guitars would be re-recorded, then bass and drum tracks would be put on top, then vocals. Jeff also mentioned during the interview about the 2011 Futuride EP, that he has experimented with additive synthesis on the recent songs he has recorded and uses guitars to counterbalance the sounds generated by the additive synthesis.|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought that [...] "the out-takes [...] up to standard" [...] {{and said that the}} episode {{contains}} [...] "a number of great self-referential moments". Simone Knox praised its visual style in her article Reading the Ungraspable Double-Codedness of [...] "The Simpsons". The episode itself has been described by some critics as a kind of self-imposed benchmark of the show itself, with writer Bill Keveney commenting, [...] "the show picks its own benchmarks, as it did in 1995". Knox referred to it as not simply a clip show, but a clip show [...] "that looks at the series with a sense of hyper-self-consciousness about its own textuality". DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said even though the episode is a clip show, it [...] "gussies up the concept with some interesting elements, and keeps repetitive material to a minimum. Instead, it offers lots of then-unseen footage as well as old snippets from The Tracey Ullman Show. It still feels like a cheap way to crank out a new episode, but it’s one of the better clip shows you’ll see." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B+ grade and commented, [...] "apart from the creative material, what really makes this [...] shine is the hilarious hosting by Troy McClure." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times criticized the episode: [...] "Despite some interesting concepts such as a bored Troy McClure presenting to much amusement and the presence of deleted scenes and Tracey Ullman shorts amongst the clips, this is an episode that tries <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> hook but never quite manages, assuring it'll never make it into regular rotation on this viewer's watch." ...|$|E
