Due to electro-mechanical coupling of SMA wires reflected in controlled force generation capacity, the SMA based devices can provide better alternatives for traditional relays, solenoid valves and opto-coupler isolators. The control algorithm {{involved in this}} sensing technique, reads the switch status for shaft rotation and sense the angular displacement thereafter.

Experiments are carried out under vibrating conditions and obtained results are compared with conventional optical incremental encoder. The result shows that SMA based <b>angle</b> <b>encoder</b> works efficiently and gives more accurate results under disturbance while optical encoders are quite sensitive to similar platform vibration.

40|$|The {{closed-loop}} conical-scan (conscan) {{technique has}} proven to be a useful method for pointing the DSN antennas more accurately than is possible by open-loop methods. As presently implemented, the antenna beam is scanned about the received signal direction by physical movement of the antenna. While straightforward, this approach has at least two disadvantages. Firstly, because of structural distortions, finite <b>angle</b> <b>encoder</b> resolution, and drive servo response, the actual antenna beam direction only approximates the commanded beam direction. Secondly, because of the large mass moved during scan, the rate of scan is severely restricted. If there are significant gain or signal level variations during a scan period, the conscan system interprets these variations as antenna pointing error. Both of these disadvantages would be alleviated in an inertialess conscan system in which the beam scanning was performed electronically.

Use of the electronic gauge, to count trees within five concentric circles, resulted in {{a decrease in the}} variation of estimated forest volume, as the number of circles increased. This estimate became reliable upon reaching the fourth concentric circle. In contrast, the use of a conventional angle gauge revealed no obvious regularity and no significant trend using multiple observation points.

40|$|Diesel engine {{cylinder}} pressure measurements {{are widely used}} in field and lab applications to support among other control, monitoring and diagnostic applications. There are two methods to measure cylinder pressure, {{the use of a}} crank <b>angle</b> <b>encoder,</b> which guarantees pressure samples at fixed crank angles, and the use of constant time sampling rate. The last is frequently used due to its simplicity or because of practical restrictions. However, in order to perform thermodynamic calculations it is necessary to attribute a crank angle value to each measured pressure value. But if the in-cycle rotational speed fluctuates and this is neglected, an error will result in the values derived from the processing of the measured cylinder pressure. For this reason in the present work an experimental investigation is conducted on a single cylinder diesel test engine to identify the aforementioned problem. During the tests cylinder pressure and instantaneous speed were recorded using an accurate crank angle reference. These where then used to simulate the measurement of cylinder pressure digitized using a fixed time step. The comparison of the two cylinder pressure traces and the thermodynamic parameters derived from them, reveals the introduction of an error which depends on engine load and speed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Within the BMU project "Organbezogene schadstoffanalytische Untersuchungen an Gewebeproben ehemaliger Beschäftigter im Uranerzbergbau der SAG/SDAG Wismut " especially the behaviour of uranium mineral particles in lungs is examined. Under the physiological conditions in lungs, leaching of the dust particles is possible, which can be accompanied by alterations of the oxidation state of uranium and its coordination sphere. The XAFS spectroscopy is especially suited for the examination of these changes. Therefore, leaching experiments with a lymph-similar liquid were carried out on the most important uranium ore, uraninite.
