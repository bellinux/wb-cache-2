40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{preclinical}} and clinical evidence {{regarding the use}} of the dietary supplement 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTP) for the treatment of depression. In the absence of supplementation with exogenous 5 -HTP, the amount of endogenous 5 -HTP available for serotonin synthesis depends on the availability of tryptophan and on the activity of various enzymes, especially tryptophan hydroxylase, indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase, and tryptophan 2, 3 -dioxygenase (TDO). Factors affecting each of these are reviewed. The amount of 5 -HTP reaching the central nervous system (CNS) is affected by the extent to which 5 -HTP is converted to serotonin in the periphery. This conversion is controlled by the enzyme amino acid decarboxylase, which, in the periphery, can be blocked by peripheral decarboxylase inhibitors (PDIs) such as carbidopa. Preclinical and clinical evidence for the efficacy of 5 -HTP for depression is reviewed, with emphasis on double-blind, placebo-controlled (DB-PC) trials. Safety issues with 5 -HTP are also reviewed, with emphasis on <b>eosinophilia</b> <b>myalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> (EMS) and serotonin syndrome...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that Na(+) -coupled transport of glucose and amino acids across the apical membrane of intestinal absorptive cells {{is accompanied by}} alterations in cytoskeletal structure and altered sieving of small hydrophilic solutes by tight junctions. Here we report that {{in response to the}} essential amino acid L-tryptophan at lumenal concentrations likely to be supraphysiological (1 mM or greater), these responses are so exaggerated as to induce disruption of tight junctions and transepithelial macromolecular leaks. Since these effects of L-tryptophan are energy and Na+ dependent and occur with mucosal but not serosal exposure to L-tryptophan, it appears they are triggered by activation of a Na(+) -nutrient cotransporter in the apical membrane of absorptive cells rather than by the presence of an unidentified trace contaminant. Our findings suggest the possibility that dietary supplementation by L-tryptophan may result in loss of the intestinal epithelial barrier to dietary antigens. We speculate that such a response to supraphysiologic tryptophan may contribute, in part, to the recently recognized curious tryptophan-induced <b>eosinophilia</b> <b>myalgia</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of the <b>eosinophilia</b> <b>myalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> (EMS) remains unclear. Several abnormal constituents {{have been}} found in the L-tryptophan lots responsible for the illness, particularly, 1, 1 -ethylidenebis[L-tryptophan], also called peak E or EBT, and 3 -phenylamino-alanine or peak 5. However, the role of these contaminants in the pathogenesis of EMS and in the development of fibrosis is unknown. We now report that peak E, a dimer of L-tryptophan, is a potent stimulus for human dermal fibroblast DNA and collagen synthesis. Peak E (0. 1 - 1. 0 microM) increased DNA synthesis up to four-fold (P = 0. 0001) in a dose-dependent manner (r = 0. 987). When added to monolayer cultures for 2 to 24 h, peak E (0. 5 to 100 microM) caused a progressive, more than threefold increase in alpha 1 (I) procollagen mRNA levels and collagenous protein. No increase in procollagen mRNA levels was found after the addition of another major L-tryptophan contaminant, peak 5, or with L-tryptophan itself. Transient transfection with a 2. 5 -kb alpha 1 (I) procollagen promoter-luciferase construct showed that peak E causes a twofold upregulation of promoter activity (P = 0. 022). Contraction of collagen gels, consisting of human dermal fibroblasts incorporated into a type I collagen lattice, was enhanced two-fold by exposure to peak E (P = 0. 001). We conclude that a major constituent of contaminated batches of L-tryptophan, peak E, is a potent stimulus for fibroblast activation and collagen synthesis. This stimulatory action of peak E may provide a direct mechanism for the development of fibrosis in EMS...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 In 1981, illegal {{processing}} of rapeseed oil by a Spanish oil refinery {{resulted in the}} mass foodborne illness epidemic known as Toxic Oil Syndrome (TOS). The toxic oil associated with this epidemic was sold in neighborhood markets and by itinerant salesmen as inexpensive olive oil. Ingestion of the toxic oil resulted in more than 20, 000 illnesses and over 1, 500 deaths in Spain. The etiologic agent of TOS remains unknown. In addition, animal studies have provided little insight into the mechanisms of toxicity because no animal model exhibits the symptoms of TOS. Researchers of Eosinophilia- <b>Myalgia</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (EMS) are in a similar quandary. EMS occurred in the United States in 1989, and the symptoms of this illness parallel TOS quite closely. The MRL/lpr mouse model has been suggested as a possible model for immunotoxicity caused by environmental exposure.

40|$|The daily {{nutritional}} requirement for L-tryptophan (Trp) is modest (5 mg/kg). However, many adults choose to consume much more, up to 4 – 5 g/d (60 – 70 mg/kg), typically to improve mood or sleep. Ingesting L-Trp raises brain tryptophan levels and stimulates its conversion to serotonin in neurons, which {{is thought to}} mediate its actions. Are there side effects from Trp supplementation? Some consider drowsiness a side effect, but not those who use it to improve sleep. Though the literature is thin, occasional side effects, seen mainly at higher doses (70 – 200 mg/kg), include tremor, nausea, and dizziness, and may occur when Trp is taken alone or with a drug that enhances serotonin function (e. g., antidepressants). In rare cases, the ‘‘serotonin syndrome’ ’ occurs, the result of too much serotonin stimulation when Trp is combined with serotonin drugs. Symptoms include delirium, myoclonus, hyperthermia, and coma. In 1989 a new syndrome appeared, dubbed <b>eosinophilia</b> <b>myalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> (EMS), and was quickly linked to supplemental Trp use. Key symptoms included debilitating myalgia (muscle pain) and a high peripheral eosinophil count. The cause was shown not to be Trp but a contaminant in certain production batches. This is not surprising, because side effects long associated with Trp use were not those associatedwith the EMS. Over 5 decades, Trp has been taken as a supplement and {{as an adjunct to}} medications with occasional modest, short-lived side effects. Still, the database is small and largely anecdotal. A thorough, dose-related assessment of side effects remains to be conducted. J. Nutr. 142 : 2236 S– 2244 S, 2012...|$|E
40|$|In 1989, the {{development}} of <b>eosinophilia</b> <b>myalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> (EMS) was observed in some patients after the intake of l-tryptophan containing several contaminants, including 1, 1 ′-ethylidenebis[l-tryptophan] (‘peak E’). Since l-tryptophan has been taken particularly by individuals suffering from functional somatic syndromes (FSS), such as fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), we put forward the hypothesis that EMS may have developed preferentially in patients with FSS as an allergic reaction towards the contaminant peak E. We therefore studied the immunological reactivity towards l-tryptophan and peak E in these individuals (n = 12) and compared these data with those obtained in 12 healthy controls and 12 patients with other chronic disorders. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were cultured for 7 days with pure l-tryptophan and peak E. Supernatant fluids were collected at day 7. The type 2 cytokines IL- 4, IL- 5 and IL- 10, and the type 1 cytokines IL- 2 and IFN-γ, were determined by a double sandwich ELISA. PBMC from seven of the 12 FSS patients, but {{only three of the}} 24 controls, produced cytokines after incubation with peak E (P < 0 · 05). Interestingly, six of the seven FSS patients reacting with peak E produced IL- 5 and/or IL- 10. In contrast, PBMC from only one patient with other chronic disorders and one healthy control secreted type 2 cytokines in response to peak E. The observed heightened type 2 reactivity towards the more immunogenic contaminant 1, 1 ′-ethylidenebis[l-tryptophan] in FSS patients may therefore be taken as an additional argument for our concept that EMS may have developed as a kind of drug-induced allergic disease...|$|E
40|$|Outbreak investigations, an {{important}} and challenging component of epidemiology and public health, can help identify the source of ongoing outbreaks and prevent additional cases. Even when an outbreak is over, a thorough epidemiologic and environmental investigation often can increase our knowledge of a given disease and prevent future outbreaks. Finally, outbreak investigations provide epidemiologic training and foster cooperation between the clinical and public health communities. Investigations of acute infectious disease outbreaks are very common, {{and the results of}} such investigations are often published; however, surprisingly little {{has been written about the}} actual procedures followed during such investigations (1, 2). Most epidemiologists and public health officials learn the procedures by conducting investigations with the initial assistance of more experienced colleagues. This article outlines the general approach to conducting an outbreak investigation. The approach applies not only to infectious disease outbreaks but also to outbreaks due to noninfectious causes (e. g., toxic exposure). How Outbreaks Are Recognized Possible outbreaks of disease come to the attention of public health officials in various ways. Often, an astute clinician, infection control nurse, or clinical laboratory worker first notices an unusual disease or an unusual number of cases of a disease and alerts public health officials. For example, staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome and <b>eosinophilia</b> <b>myalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> were first noted by clinicians (3, 4). Frequently, it is the patient (or someone close to the patient) who first suspects a problem, as is often the case in foodborne outbreaks after a shared meal and as was the case in the investigation of a cluster of cases of apparent juvenile rheumatoid arthritis near Lyme, Connecticut, which led to the discovery of Lyme disease (5).

40|$|Background & objectives: Trichinellosis is a {{parasitic}} infection caused by Trichinella nematodes, acquired from consumption of raw meat. However, data from Indian subcontinent are limited. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the clinical and biochemical profile of a suspected trichinellosis outbreak in a village in Tehri Garhwal district of Uttarakhand state in north India. Methods: Three index cases presenting as acute febrile <b>myalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> with <b>eosinophilia,</b> after consumption of uncooked pork in a common feast, were confirmed as trichinellosis on muscle biopsy. A detailed epidemiological survey was carried out in the affected community and all the people who participated in the feast were investigated for clinical and biochemical profile. Results: A total of 54 patients were evaluated in the study. The type of pork consumed included uncooked in 24 per cent (n= 13), open fire roasted in 39 per cent (n= 21) and fried in 37 per cent (n= 20). Clinical symptoms were found in those who consumed pork in uncooked or open fire roasted form (n= 34). These included fever with chills and myalgia (100 %), periorbital oedema (67 %), dyspnoea (9 %), and dysphagia (3 %). Laboratory parameters studied in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients showed eosinophilia in 90 per cent (n= 41), raised ESR in 98 per cent (n= 45), and an elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) level in 85 per cent (n= 39).

The {{clinical}} manifestations are fever, arthralgia and <b>myalgia.</b> Guillain-Barré <b>Syndrome</b> (GBS) caused by dengue fever has been rarely reported. Presentation of Case: A 46 -year-old {{man with no}} relevant medical history was seen because of progressive quadriparesis, dysautonomia, dysphagia and facial paresia. Ten days before seeking medical care the patient had fever, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, thrombocytopenia, and a positive NS 1 dengue antigen. GBS was suspected and immunoglobulin was started while nerve conduction studies confirmed an acute motor axonal polyradiculoneuropathy. According to Brighton criteria, the patient was classified with a level 2 diagnostic certainty, since {{it was decided to}} not perform lumbar puncture for CSF analysis. The patient had a good clinical response and was subsequently discharged. Discussion: Dengue virus is arthropod-borne. It presents with high fever, rash, arthralgia, myalgia, and in rare cases, neurological complications such as GBS.

The initial onset of illness was usuallv acute, and patients presented primarily with a respiratory syndrome involving cough, fever, dyspnea, hypoxemia, pulmonary infiltrates and pleural effusions. While approximately 50 % of patients recovered from this acute phase of the illness without apparent sequelae, the remaining patients developed an intermediate or chronic phase, or both, of illness involving severe <b>myalgia,</b> <b>eosinophilia,</b> peripheral nerve damage, sclerodermiform skin lesions, sicca syndrome, alopecia and joint contractures, among other findings. Epidemiologic and analytic chemical studies have clearly linked the toxic oil syndrome to the ingestion of oil mixtures containing rapeseed oil denatured with aniline. However, the precise identity of the etiologic agent within this oil has never been determined. Aniline itself did not cause the illness, but the causal agent may be a reaction product of aniline with some oil component.

None of the patients and controls presented musculoskeletal pain syndromes, and the frequencies of all antibodies and cyoglobulins were similar in both groups (p > 0. 05). Further analysis of leprosy patients demonstrated that the frequencies of nerve function impairment, type 1 leprosy reaction, and silent neuropathy were significantly observed in patients with versus without musculoskeletal manifestations (p = 0. 0036, p = 0. 0001, and p = 0. 309, respectively), as well as multibacillary subtypes in leprosy (86 % vs. 42 %, p = 0. 045). The median of physicians' visual analog scale (VAS), patients' VAS, pain VAS, and Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) were significantly higher in leprosy patients with musculoskeletal manifestations (p = 0. 0001, p = 0. 002, p = 0002, and p = 0. 001, respectively). Conclusions:This was the first study to identify musculoskeletal manifestations associated with nerve dysfunction in pediatric leprosy patients.

40|$|Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is {{a member}} of the genus Phlebovirus within the family Bunyaviridae. It can cause severe {{epidemics}} among ruminants and fever, <b>myalgia,</b> a hemorrhagic <b>syndrome,</b> and/or encephalitis in humans. The RVFV M segment encodes the NSm and 78 -kDa proteins and two major envelope proteins, Gn and Gc. The biological functions of the NSm and 78 -kDa proteins are unknown; both proteins are dispensable for viral replication in cell cultures. To determine the biological functions of the NSm and 78 -kDa proteins, we generated the mutant virus arMP- 12 -del 21 / 384, carrying a large deletion in the pre-Gn region of the M segment. Neither NSm nor the 78 -kDa protein was synthesized in arMP- 12 -del 21 / 384 -infected cells. Although arMP- 12 -del 21 / 384 and its parental virus, arMP- 12, showed similar growth kinetics and viral RNA and protein accumulation in infected cells, arMP- 12 -del 21 / 384 -infected cells induced extensive cell death and produced larger plaques than did arMP- 12 -infected cells. arMP- 12 -del 21 / 384 replication triggered apoptosis, including the cleavage of caspase- 3, the cleavage of its downstream substrate, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and activation of the initiator caspases, caspase- 8 and - 9, earlier in infection than arMP- 12. NSm expression in arMP- 12 -del 21 / 384 -infected cells suppressed the severity of caspase- 3 activation. Further, NSm protein expression inhibited the staurosporine-induced activation of caspase- 8 and - 9, demonstrating that other viral proteins were dispensable for NSm's function in inhibiting apoptosis. RVFV NSm protein is the first identified Phlebovirus protein that has an antiapoptotic function...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} musculoskeletal {{involvement and}} autoantibodies in pediatric leprosy patients. Methods: 50 leprosy patients and 47 healthy {{children and adolescents}} were assessed according to musculoskeletal manifestations (arthralgia, arthritis, and <b>myalgia),</b> musculoskeletal pain <b>syndromes</b> (juvenile fibromyalgia, benign joint hypermobility syndrome, myofascial syndrome, and tendinitis), and a panel of autoantibodies and cryoglobulins. Health assessment scores and treatment were performed in leprosy patients. Results: At least one musculoskeletal manifestation was observed in 14 % of leprosy patients and in none of the controls. Five leprosy patients had asymmetric polyarthritis of small hands joints.

40|$|Background: Medical {{treatment}} of {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) {{is becoming more and}} more complex, as several classes of immuno-modulating drugs (IMD) are often used simultaneously. Thus, the probability of adverse effects is greatly increased. Most studies reporting on adverse effects focus on single therapy, and studies providing a global survey of side effects for multiple treatments are lacking. Aim: To assess the type and frequency of adverse events in IBD patients treated with single and multiple IMD therapy. Methods: Analysis of data from the Swiss IBD Cohort Study (SIBDCS) that collects data on a large sample of IBD patients from hospitals and private practices across Switzerland. The following IMD categories were analyzed: 5 -ASA, azathioprine (Aza), 6 -mercaptopurine (6 -MP), methotrexate (MTX), anti-TNF (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab-pegol), cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and steroids. The following side effects were assessed: hepatitis, pancreatitis, leucopenia, thrombopenia, nephritis, allergic reaction, pneumonitis, infections (including tuberculosis), osteoporosis, abdominal pain/diarrhea (unrelated to IBD activity), cataract, diabetes, exanthema, hirsutism, lupus-like <b>syndrome,</b> <b>myalgias,</b> depression/psychosis, tumor development. Results: A total of 1, 961 patients were analyzed (977 [50 %] female, mean age 42. 1 ± 14. 4 years) : 1, 119 with Crohn's disease (CD), 800 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 42 with indeterminate colitis (IC). Three-hundred eighteen (16. 2 %) patients were not treated with any of the above-mentioned medications, while 650 (33. 2 %), 569 (29 %) and 424 (21. 6 %) patients had one-, two-, and three- or more- IMD therapy, respectively. Of the 1, 643 patients treated with IMD, 535 (32. 6 %) patients reported at least one side effect. We found a significant correlation between the number of drugs used by a patient and the frequency of side effects (17. 4 % side effects for one drug, 29 % for 2 drugs, and 60. 6 % for three or more drugs, p < 0. 001). The frequency of side effects for the different IMD classes were as follows: 5 -ASA (n = 980 treated patients) 10. 8 %, Aza/ 6 -MP (n = 636) 51. 9 % (pancreatitis in 57 = 9 %, hepatitis in 17 = 2. 7 % of treated patients), MTX (n = 146) 42. 5 % (hepatitis in 4 = 2. 7 % of treated patients), anti-TNF (n = 255) 23. 1 %, cyclosporine (n = 49) 10. 2 %, tacrolimus (n = 5) 20 %, steroids (systemic or topical, n = 1, 150) 9. 6 %. Conclusion: IBD treatment is associated with a significant number of side effects. A direct correlation between the number of IMD used simultaneously and the frequency of side effects was observed. The results of this study indicate that treating physicians should be vigilant for the occurrence of side effects in IBD patients under single and/or multiple drug therapy...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue at the {{workplace}} {{has been described}} as a multidimensional construct, affecting the overall state of the whole organism, which may be a consequence of prolonged work and various psychological, socioeconomic, and environmental factors. In the short term, fatigue may lead to discomfort, diminished motor control, reduced proprioception, increased force variability, and reduced strength capability, resulting in reduced performance, lowered productivity, deficits in work quality, and increased incidence of accidents and human errors. Fatigue may also lead to longer-term adverse health outcomes such as chronic fatigue <b>syndrome,</b> <b>myalgia,</b> and burnout <b>syndromes,</b> and may be a precursor to WMSDs – work-related musculoskeletal disorders. If indeed fatigue is a precursor to WMSDs and other long-term health outcomes, it may then be a relevant biomarker for cumulative exposure to repetitive and/or sustained work, and thus a useful risk indicator and/or a design and evaluation tool. However, little is known of the temporal pattern of fatigue development and its relationships with disorder risks and work performance. The objective of this thesis was to identify and evaluate a battery of fatigue measures for both laboratory and field-based research, and provide insight into fatigue development in work-relevant task conditions. Six studies were designed to address these objectives. In the first study, measures and analysis methods that detect fatigue-related changes were identified by a group of expert fatigue researchers. The second was an exploratory study focused on the responsiveness of a select number of measures during a workday and multiple workdays in realistic physically demanding residential plumbing work. In the third study, a selected number of conventional and novel measures were evaluated for their reliability and sensitivity in a controlled laboratory setting. This study also addressed the responsiveness of measures during a test battery or during the fatiguing activity (i. e., continuously), and the time between cessation of activity and test battery in which measures remain responsive. The fourth study reported on whether circadian effects were detectable by selected measures, providing insight towards the daylong reliability of these measures. In the fifth study, measures were evaluated in four fatiguing conditions, representing changes in type of contraction, intensity, and body segment. Furthermore, the pattern of fatigue development and the temporal responsiveness of measures were described. Finally, measures were assessed over an 8 -hour light precision micropipetting task to investigate temporal responsiveness of measures and fatigue development. Errors were quantified and the effects of scheduled work breaks were reported. In study 1, fifty-seven measures were identified based on outcomes and/or effects of fatigue in {{the workplace}}. Based on the perceived validity, reliability, and practicality in laboratory and field investigations, four measures were recommended for both settings: maximum voluntary contractions, questionnaires and fatigue scales, Borg’s rating of perceived exercise or discomfort, and visual analog scales. On the other hand, twenty-five measures were not recommended for field studies, including methods traditionally recognized as “gold standard” in measuring cellular and metabolic changes. In study 2, fatigue was documented in realistic physically demanding work while employing a set of measures to provide a comprehensive picture of fatigue development. Not all measures revealed increasing fatigue over the workday or over the workweek, which may be a result of measures reflecting different fatigue processes. Thus, the study reinforced the need of a complementary set of measures, reflecting multiple domains, to measure and interpret the temporal development of fatigue. Two measures, rating of perceived discomfort and grip strength, indicated significant differences within a work day, notably an increase at the beginning and end of the shift (perceived discomfort) and a decrease between mid-shift and end of shift (grip strength). It was speculated that within-day trends were consistent with central fatigue mechanisms. Over multiple workdays, both central and peripheral components displayed a significant day effect. Fatigue accumulation over the workweek was observed with grip strength, physiological resting tremor, and postural tremor measures, particularly between day 1 (Tuesday) and day 4 (Friday). In study 3, test-retest reliability ranged between “poor agreement” and “almost perfect agreement”. In terms of sensitivity, action tremor, MMG RMS amplitude, postural tremor, and rating of perceived fatigue were highly responsive. Perceived fatigue remained elevated, relative to baseline, until 11 minutes post-exercise. Postural and physiological tremor persisted from baseline until the third minute of recovery. Action tremor, however, quickly recovered within the first minute of recovery. This current study found that for most of the measures, there were no statistical differences between test battery and continuous measurement, but a few measures were approaching statistical significance. Action tremor and mechanomyography collected during a test contraction, and perceived fatigue assessed by a visual analog scale, were found to be most reliable, most responsive, comparable to continuous measures, and sensitive after the fatiguing activity, and should be considered with other measures of interest, as part of a test battery. In study 4, only two measures revealed a statistically significant time-of-day effect: mechanomyography of a flexor forearm muscle and action tremor at 30 % MVC. These two measures exhibited rhythmicity based on cosinor analysis. Therefore a degree of caution might be required when interpreting daylong fatigue with these two measures, whereas the other measures may not be susceptible to, or detect, significant diurnal effects. Although the remaining measures did not reveal statistically significant time effects, most measures were characterized with similar patterns to those found in previous literature. In study 5, there was no one universal measure that was common, in terms of responsiveness, in all exercise conditions. Although no single measure was found to be most responsive in all conditions, there were measures responsive in most exercise conditions as either a continuous or test battery measure. This was the case with action tremor. A maximum voluntary contraction, which is dependent on processes in both central and peripheral domains, was similarly responsive. Rating of perceived fatigue, which has been cited as a centrally mediated indicator, was also found to increase with exercise progression in hand conditions. Therefore fatigue measures, reflecting changes to both central and peripheral processes, may be useful in measuring tasks and exercises of varying parameters. In this study, we support earlier investigations on the pattern of fatigue development in isometric and time-varying (e. g., intermittent isometric, concentric) contractions. The temporal responsiveness of central and peripheral measures, on the other hand, may be a better reflection of the intensity of the task. The shoulder intermittent condition was not consistent with the expected pattern for an intermittent isometric contraction. However, the study protocol may have inadvertently generated lower muscle activity, and therefore the extent of fatigue may have been minimal. There remains a need to understand complex combinations of task-dependent factors in both fatigue development and temporal responsiveness. In study 6, nine measurement parameters revealed significant increases in fatigue over the work period. Traditional field measures (i. e., MVC and EMG) did not lead to extraordinary time effects. Error rates followed similar trends to the 9 significant measurements: an increase from baseline towards mid-morning, a slight decrease prior to the lunch break, a nadir after lunch, and increasing fatigue effects over the course of the afternoon. Error rates, however, might not be a sole consequence of fatigue – cognitive and physical; but might also reflect changes in arousal level. Over the pipetting task, there was interplay between peripheral and central fatigue mechanisms in three body segments: thumb, hand, and shoulder. Fatigue developed at a “local” level (i. e., at the three body segments) and was consistent with expected patterns observed in study 5, particularly if thumb and shoulder actions were considered concentric actions and the grip force was a sustained isometric contraction. Overall, the collective assessments suggested that rating of perceived fatigue and action tremor, on average, were highly repeatable and responsive in multiple task conditions. Postural tremor or steadiness and maximum voluntary contractions were moderately reliable and responsive. Different forms of tremor may be responsive to different task conditions. Postural tremor amplitude was found to increase over the course of an 8 -hour workday in a light precision work task, and over multiple days in physically demanding work. Action tremor, on the other hand, appeared to be responsive at higher work intensities performed at a shorter duration of time. Possibly, action tremor may be more indicative of changes in the periphery, whereas postural tremor reflects changes more central in nature. Consequently, these measures should be considered for inclusion into a test battery for field use. For the ergonomist or health and safety practitioner, this body of work provides some insight into the utility of a test battery of fatigue measures to complement current task analysis techniques. For workplace researchers, this dissertation provides insight into the temporal development of fatigue in various task conditions and the reliability and responsiveness of select measures in both short and longer-term work-studies. This research might subsequently elicit future investigations in the relationship between work exposure, fatigue development, and performance and longer-term health outcomes...|$|R
