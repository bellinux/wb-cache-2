The ‘health’ of the peritoneal membrane and its endurance as dialysis filter {{are influenced by the}} uraemic environment and the chronic exposure to peritoneal <b>dialysis</b> <b>fluids.</b> The medical, scientific and industrial societies have mounted a great interest regarding the role of biocompatibility of peritoneal <b>dialysis</b> <b>fluids</b> on peritoneal dialysis adverse events, as ultrafiltration failure, peritonitis and encapsulated peritoneal sclerosis. Long term exposure to conventional glucose, lactate buffered dialysis fluid may provoke peritoneal damage, by neovascularization, translated clinically as ultrafiltration failure. The most adverse bioincompatible factors of <b>dialysis</b> <b>fluids</b> seem to be the acidic pH, the lactic acid buffer, the glucose, the hyperosmolality, the glucose degradation products and the advanced glycation end products. Long?time research in the biocompatibility field shed new light to the pathophysiology of peritoneal damage in peritonitis and long?term peritoneal dialysis and led to the industrial production of new peritoneal <b>dialysis</b> <b>fluids</b> of alternative osmotic factor and buffer. The ultimate purpose of the ‘newer’ <b>dialysis</b> <b>fluids</b> as opposed to conventional is a ‘healthier’ peritoneum and a ‘long?lived’ method of peritoneal dialysis in the arsenal of renal replacement therapies for end stage renal disease. Biocompatibility research of <b>dialysis</b> <b>fluids,</b> in vitro, in animals and ex vivo, has innate problems of methodology and results’ analysis which leads sometimes to contradictive and non comparable results. On the other hand, we are still lacking long term large clinical randomized clinical trials, which could verify the superiority of new to conventional fluids. We compared new and conventional unused peritoneal <b>dialysis</b> <b>fluids</b> by way of their influence on cytokines’ release by peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers, with or without stimulation, as a parameter of in vitro biocompatibility. We used an experimental procedure assimilating as much as possible the peritoneal equilibration of pH and osmolality of the peritoneal dwell. Six solutions were examined: Conventional glucose lactate buffered, as isotonic (1. 5 % dextrose) (1), and hypertonic (4. 25 % dextrose) (2) solution. Newer glucose based solutions, pyruvate buffered as isotonic (1. 0 % dextrose) (3) and hypertonic (4. 0 % dextrose) (4) 103 solutions.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{biocompatibility}} {{performance of a}} 25 mmol/L bicarbonate/ 10 mmol/L lactate-buffered peritoneal dialysis fluid. Background. The biocompatibility profile of a new peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution (Physioneal 35) was determined using a selection of in vitro assay systems. Physioneal 35 is buffered {{by a combination of}} 25 mmol/L bicarbonate and 10 mmol/L lactate, thereby providing a solution with a total of 35 mmol/L of alkali to complement the currently available 25 mmol/L bicarbonate and 15 mmol/L lactate combination solution, Physioneal 40. In addition, the new solution contains a calcium concentration of 1. 75 mmol/L rather than 1. 25 mmol/L present in Physioneal 40. Physioneal 35 and 40 are manufactured in double chamber bag systems that permit separation of glucose from the buffer during sterilization. When the two chambers are mixed just before patient use, the resulting solution has a neutral pH and reduced glucose degradation content. Physioneal 35 was evaluated for its cytotoxicity potential using a murine fibroblast assay, its acute effect on human neutrophil and human peritoneal mesothelial cell function, and its in vitro potential to form advanced glycation end products (AGE). The biocompatibility characteristics of this new formulation were compared with that of a conventional, lactate-based solution and to that of its parent formulation, Physioneal 40. MethodsProliferation of murine fibroblasts was determined after exposure to <b>dialysis</b> <b>fluids</b> for 72 hours. Cell viability was assayed by the ability to take up neutral red dye. Human neutrophils were exposed for 15 minutes to <b>dialysis</b> <b>fluids,</b> and their ATP content and phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) stimulated chemiluminescence response was determined as a measure of viability and respiratory burst activity, respectively. Cellular interleukin (IL) - 1 β–driven IL- 8 synthesis by human mesothelial cells following acute exposure to <b>dialysis</b> <b>fluids</b> was also assessed. Advanced glycation end product formation in the <b>dialysis</b> <b>fluids</b> was measured after 5 and 20 days of incubation with human serum albumin (HSA) as the model protein. ResultsIn all assays employed, the biocompatibility profile of Physioneal 35 was {{similar to that of the}} Physioneal 40 parent formulation. Physioneal 35 showed a significant improvement in biocompatibility performance compared to a pH neutralized conventional lactate-buffered peritoneal dialysis solution in the murine fibroblast assay. In the acute exposure assays, human neutrophil viability and respiratory burst were significantly improved compared with the acidic, conventional solution; however, no statistically significant improvement were seen in mesothelial cells. AGE formation, which is thought to be an important mechanism by which glucose and glucose degradation products cause structural and functional changes of the peritoneal membrane, was significantly lower in Physioneal 35 compared with the conventional dialysis solution. ConclusionThe biocompatibility profile of Physioneal 35 was similar to that of the original Physioneal 40 bicarbonate/ lactate-buffered dialysis solution, confirming that differences in both buffer content and calcium concentration do not affect biocompatibility performance. Both bicarbonate/lactate formulations (Physioneal 35 and Physioneal 40) were more biocompatible than a conventional lactate-buffered dialysis solution in this in vitro biocompatibility assessment...|$|E

Results. In contrast to the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) -test, which only detects intact lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the THP- 1 assay was also sensitive to peptidoglycan, short bacterial DNA fragments and LPS fragments < 5 kD.

40|$|Solutions were {{formulated}} to examine, independently, {{the roles}} of osmolality and glucose in the reduction of viability and inhibition of phagocyte function by dextrose-containing peritoneal <b>dialysis</b> <b>fluids.</b> The exposure of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) to test fluids containing > or = 2. 7 % (wt/vol) glucose resulted in significant cytotoxicity as assessed by the release of lactate dehydrogenase above control values (7. 12 +/- 2. 65 %). At the highest concentration of glucose (4. 5 %), lactate dehydrogenase release was 15. 83 +/- 0. 49 % (P < 0. 05). These effects were {{directly related to the}} presence of D-glucose in the test fluids. In contrast, phagocytosis and the release of leukotriene B 4 from PMN stimulated with serum-treated zymosan were significantly inhibited in an osmolality-, but not glucose-, dependent manner. The inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin- 6 release from mononuclear leukocytes was inhibited by a combination of osmolality and monosaccharide concentration. Under the same conditions, PMN respiratory burst activation remained unaffected irrespective of glucose concentration or fluid osmolality. These data indicate that, in addition to the low pH of peritoneal dialysis fluid and its high lactate concentration, its glucose content (either directly or {{as a consequence of the}} resulting hyperosmolality of the fluid) inhibits cell functional parameters.

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) and other inflammatory cytokines (IL- 6, IL- 1 beta and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha)) on the occurrence of peritonitis in patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). METHODS [...] The study population comprised 12 patients with peritonitis, 33 without peritonitis, all undergoing CAPD, and five patients undergoing peritoneal catheter implantation. Cytokine concentrations in <b>dialysis</b> <b>fluid</b> were determined by immunoassay and their values compared. RESULTS [...] Concentrations of both IL- 8 (median 147 pg/ml, range 20 - 2273 pg/ml; n = 12) and IL- 6 (median 1120 pg/ml, range 96 - 10, 600 pg/ml) were substantially elevated, while the IL- 1 beta concentration was lower and TNF alpha was not detectable in patients at diagnosis. The IL- 6 concentration was also elevated in patients undergoing catheter implantation {{as well as in}} those with peritonitis. The IL- 8 concentration, however, was elevated only upon infection. Intraperitoneal production of IL- 8 was evident on determination of paired serum and <b>dialysis</b> <b>fluid</b> cytokine concentrations, and immunostaining of peritoneal cells with monoclonal anti-IL- 8 antibody. CONCLUSIONS [...] These results suggest that determination of the IL- 8 concentration in <b>dialysis</b> <b>fluid</b> maybe useful as a specific marker for following patients with peritonitis receiving CAPD...|$|R
