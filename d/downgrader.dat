For example, when releasing census data or corporate financial information, the release must be conducted {{in a manner consistent}} with individual privacy. The process of publicly releasing formerly private data is called downgrading. However, it may be possible to infer unreleased private information from the downgraded public information—the socalled inference problem. Here, we discuss some of the design decisions that we have made, and continue to make, concerning our prototype for a high assurance system that evaluates downgrading decisions based upon the amount of private information that may be deduced through inference. Our software system, the Rational <b>Downgrader,</b> is composed of a knowledge-based decision maker to determine the rules that may be inferred, a GUARD to measure the amount of leaked information, and a parsimonious <b>downgrader</b> to modify the initial downgrading decisions. At present, we have restricted the Rational <b>Downgrader</b> to relational databases. Of course, the underlying theories apply to all forms of data. In this paper, we concentrate on design decisions made with the aim of achieving high assurance with respect to an optimality condition. 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a longitudinal study into the pragmatic development of German learners of English. The data were elicited with the newly developed “Multimedia Elicitation Task” (MET), which contains 16 request scenarios investigating different status and imposition conditions. The 27 participants included 12 German adults studying at a British university for one academic year and an English native speaker control group of 15 students. The data were collected at three distinct points of the Germans’ stay in Great Britain: shortly after their arrival, {{in the middle of their}} stay and shortly before their return to Germany. The results provide evidence both for temporal patterning and for individual variation in the learner group. Generally, internal lexical <b>downgraders</b> seem to be acquired earlier than syntactic <b>downgraders,</b> and external modifiers can be assigned to four main groups: the first group contains supportive moves that had already been acquired by all the participants before the first data collection session and the remaining three groups comprise external modifiers whose first occurrence in the corpus displays a correlation with the length of stay in the target environment...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports the}} findings of a study on pragmatic ability and metapragmatic judgments of native and nonnative speakers of English conducted at a public university in the United States and also at a public university in Singapore. Specifically, the research study investigated the realization of apologies, complaints and requests focusing on the production of <b>downgraders</b> and upgraders. In addition, the study also examined metapragmatic ratings provided by these subjects and their reasons for the ratings. Thirty-eight native and thirty nonnative speakers participated in {{the first phase of the}} study, which involved responding to a 30 -item discourse completion task (DCT). In the second phase of data collection, responses to the DCT were used to construct a metapragmatic judgment task (MJT) in order to investigate subjects' metapragmatic ratings of apologies, complaints and requests. A new group of native speakers (69 total) and thirty-seven nonnative speakers (a new but comparable group) completed the MJT (the Singaporean subjects were unavailable for participation in the MJT). Fourteen native and 16 nonnative speakers participated in the interviews. Various statistical tests were conducted to analyze the coded DCT responses as well as the MJT data. Interview protocols were summarized to study opinions provided by subjects for the MJT ratings. Results of this research study indicated that native speakers used a significantly higher number of <b>downgraders</b> in complaints and requests than nonnative speakers. A significantly higher number of <b>downgraders</b> were also supplied in requests than in complaints. Metapragmatic ratings of native speakers differed significantly from those of nonnative speakers in 29 / 90 cases. While the two groups were significantly different in their performance on the DCT and the MJT, the subjective opinions expressed about the appropriateness of responses converged to a great extent. In conclusion, this dissertation was able to contribute to our understanding of native and nonnative speakers' use of modality markers and their perceptions about appropriate language use. The results of this study also concur with previous research that indicates the need for instruction in pragmatic aspects of the L 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} interlanguage {{pragmatics}} has burgeoned since late 20 th century. Requests, {{as a part}} of speech act theory, have been investigated by many scholars. This cross-sectional study explores the acquisition of pragmatics of Chinese learners of Japanese in foreign language contexts (JFL) by examining their request usages, which incorporates pragmatic transfer as a tool to interpret data. Discourse completion task (DCT) questionnaires were distributed to first-year, second-year and fourth-year Japanese learners at a university in China, as well as to native speakers in the U. S. to elicit requests. Requests were analyzed according to the following six categories: perspectives, speech levels, strategies, syntactic <b>downgraders,</b> semantic <b>downgraders,</b> and supportive moves. Based on data analysis, the preliminary findings are: 1) Significant improvement from the first- year group to the second-year group can be observed. 2) In general, the fourth-year group performed similar to or less native-like than the second-year group. 3) Regardless of the advancement, a gap still exists between learners and native speakers regarding pragmatics proficiency. The study not only sheds light on the evolution of learners’ interlanguage from a perspective of pragmatics, but can also reveal part of the current teaching and learning situations of Japanese pragmatics at universities in China. By discussing learners' success and potential areas that need developing, the findings could provide some meaningful implications for Japanese pedagogy...|$|R

The coordination of multi-agent teams in uncertain, dynamic domains is a challenging problem requiring the fusion of techniques from many disciplines. We describe an approach based on the dynamic and selective use of a family of different problem-solving strategies that combine stochastic state estimation with repair-based and heuristic-guided planning and scheduling techniques. This approach is implemented as a cognitive problem-solving architecture that combines (i) a deliberative scheduler, which performs partially-centralized solution repair, (ii) an opportunistic scheduler, which locally optimizes resource utilization for plan enhancement, and (iii) a <b>downgrader,</b> which proactively guides the execution into regions of higher likelihood of success.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we first}} define bisimulation-based {{non-deterministic}} admissible interference(BNAI), derive its process-theoretic characterization and present a compositional verification method {{with respect to}} the main operators over communicating processes, generalizing in this way the similar trace-based results obtained in [19] into the finer notion of observation-based bisimulation [6]. Like its trace-based version, BNAI admits information flow between secrecy levels only through a <b>downgrader</b> (e. g. a cryptosystem), but is phrased into a generalization of observational equivalence [18]. We then describe an admissible interference-based method for the analysis of cryptographic protocols, extending, in a non-trivial way, the non interference-based approach presented in [11]. Confidentiality and authentication for cryptoprotocols are defined in terms of BNAI and their respective bisimulation-based proof methods are derived. Finally, as a significant illustration of the method, we consider simple case studies: the paradigmatic examples of the Wide Mouthed Frog protocol [1] and the Woo and Lam one-way authentication protocol [25]. The original idea of this methodology is to prove that the intruder may interfere with the protocol only through selected channels considered as admissible when leading to harmless interference...|$|E

ANALYSIS OF DIRECTIVE AND EXPRESSIVE SPEECH ACTS USED BY BOTH TEACHER-LEARNERS DURING CLASSROOM INTERACTIONS FOUND IN MOVIES ENTITLED DANGEROUS MINDS, THE RON CLARK STORY, AND FACING THE GIANTS. Thesis. Muhammadiyah University of Surakarta. 2015. The use {{of speech}} acts in {{communication}} is considered successful if the interlocutor {{is able to}} understand the speakers’ messages. The current study focused on directive and expressive speech acts, aimed at identifying its types, identifying its directness levels and identifying its pragmalinguistics variations which were found in teacher-learners interactions. The object of the study was the interactions between teachers and learners in which the directive and expressive speech acts frequently occur. The sources of the data were three drama movies entitled ‘Dangerous Minds’, The Ron Clark Story’ and ‘Facing the Giants’. The movies were selected because the most of its settings took place in classroom. From the data analyzed, the directive speech acts – commanding, requesting, suggesting – the most commonly found was commanding and the least found was suggesting. In terms of the expressive speech acts – thanking, apologizing, complimenting – the dominant discovered was complimenting and the least discovered was thanking. The direct strategy is the most compare those of indirect strategy. With respect to pragmalinguistics variations, there were 8 data of syntactic <b>downgraders</b> and 14 data of lexical/phrasal <b>downgraders.</b> The result of this study has contribution to the theory of speech acts.

Elicited email data instead of naturally occurring data was used {{in order to ensure}} cross-cultural comparability. Thirty-seven native speakers of Mandarin Chinese and 35 native speakers of Australian English participated in the study. Altogether 288 emails were collected. Data was classified according to an adapted version of the coding scheme developed by Blum-Kulka et al. (1989). Internal modifiers include <b>downgraders</b> and upgraders with the focus of study on <b>downgraders.</b> External modifiers include all the supportive moves in the opening, body, and closing of email requests. Following Beebe et al. (1990), data was analysed in the frequency, content, and average number of internal and external modifiers. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods were adopted. Findings of the study show that both relative power and rank of imposition had an effect on the use of internal and external modifiers by the Mandarin Chinese speakers and Australian English speakers in email requests. However, while the two groups exhibited sensitivity to rank of imposition to a similar extent, the Chinese participants seemed to display a greater degree of sensitivity to relative power than the Australian participants. This paper discusses the sociocultural norms underlying the different requestive behaviour of the Chinese and Australian participants. It predicts the potential problems in communication between the two cultures, and highlights the importance of developing cross-cultural awareness and sensitivity. The findings of the study will shed more light on cross-cultural pragmatics and intercultural communication, and will also be of implication to learners of Chinese or English as a second or foreign language...|$|R
40|$|The aims of this {{investigation}} are to create an overview of how Norwegian upper secondary school students use modality markers in formal argumentative essays; if – and if so, which –modality markers the students use; {{and to what extent}} writer visibility is present in these student texts. Two study programs are compared in order to find any differences. These are the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IB) and Studieforberedende utdanningsprogram (SF), where two classes represent each program. Argumentative essays from each of these classes were collected and analyzed through the use of the corpus freeware AntConc and calculating relative frequencies. The findings indicate that SF students use <b>downgraders</b> and upgraders more often than their fellow IB students. They also demonstrate more frequent use of <b>downgraders</b> than upgraders in all four schools and a general adherence towards using the downtoner, agent avoider and intensifier in particular. Differences between the two study programs involve for instance the SF students using the lexical teddy bears I think and just {{to a greater extent than}} do the IB students. The results also show a stronger indication of writer stance in the text (for example, through a more frequent use of first-person singular pronouns) whereas IB students use such modality markers to a lesser extent. These findings may be impacted by, for instance, time restrictions given for writing the essays (test situations vs. homework), essay topics, register awareness and a stronger reliance on genre conventions pertaining to Norwegian-speaker or English-speaker language norms. Greater awareness of students’ use of modality markers according to register may contribute to aid teachers in the teaching of appropriate register with respect to the genre norms set for the students to learn according to their syllabus and/or curriculum. Furthermore, it may also contribute to a greater understanding of differences in genre norms in various speech communities and thus allow for the students to adapt their language according to the expectations of this community if necessary...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Intransitive non-interference (INI for short) is a {{behavioural}} property extensively {{studied by}} Rushby over deterministic automata with outputs associated to transitions (Mealy machines) {{in order to}} discuss security of systems where declassification of secret information is allowed. In this paper, we first propose a natural transposition of Rushby’s definition on deterministic labelled transition systems, we call INI as well, and then an alternative, yet more easily checkable, formulation of INI, called NI with <b>downgraders</b> (NID for short). We show how NID can be naturally extended to the case of nondeterministic automata by using a variation of it based on bisimulation equivalence (BNID). The most novel contribution of this paper is the extension of this theory on the class of Petri nets called elementary net systems: we propose a semistatic technique, called PBNID and based on the inspection of the net structure, that is shown to be equivalent to BNID. ...|$|R

Nevertheless, it tends to be problematic {{when it comes to the}} case of second language learners. This study, therefore, explores the characteristics of the interlanguage complaints of Thai learners of English who are in different contexts of studying. The data, based on the DCT (Discourse Completion Task) questionnaires, is taken from four groups of informants: (1) native Thai speakers (2) native English speakers (3) Thai learners of English in Thailand and (4) Thai learners of English in the UK. The findings are analysed within three main aspects namely, the complaint strategies, the complaint lengths and patterns, and the complaint internal modifications. The elicited data reveals that in general the learners of English in Thailand tend to have similar complaint patterns to those of native Thai speakers. On the other hand, the complaint patterns uttered by the learners of English in the UK tend to be close to those of native English speakers. Nevertheless, it seems that neither the learners of English in Thailand, nor in the UK use <b>downgraders</b> properly. The insufficient use of internal modifications, such as <b>downgraders</b> results in the learnersâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 weighty complaints compared to those of native English speakers.

This research is a descriptive qualitative method. The data of this research are the excerpts of conversation which are produced by all the characters with the other containing request strategy in Inception movie. The collected data are analyzed by determining the type of request strategy in each utterance based on Trosborg’s theory. Then, the data are determined its forms of pragmalinguistics based on Kasper’s theory. Finally, the degree of politeness is used by all the characters which it is determined using the measurement of politeness strategy based on Brown and Levinson’s theory. The last, conclusion is drawn. The results of the study show that, 1) there are four types of request strategies which are used by all the characters in Inception movie. Those are indirect request, conventionally indirect request (hearer-oriented condition), conventionally indirect request (speaker-based condition), and direct request. This is one of four types of request strategies is frequently used. That is direct request found in 48 excerpts in which the obtained request data from Inception movie is 106 excerpts. 2) There are two forms of pragmalinguistics which are applied in internal modification (syntactic <b>downgraders,</b> lexical/phrasal <b>downgraders,</b> and upgraders) and external modification. 3) Furthermore, the result shows all the characters of Inception movie followed the measurement of politeness strategy to determine the types of politeness strategy. The greatest amount of politeness strategy which is used by all the characters is bald-on record that is 72 cases. Based on the description above, the writer gets three conclusions as follows: firstly, in general, direct request is mostly used by all the characters based on request strategy.

To this end, the researchers devised the dictogloss (DIG) as a written output-based task to explicitly raise learners’ awareness of the requestive <b>downgraders.</b> The researchers also administered the recast feedback during an oral output-based task to implicitly raise learners’ awareness of the target features. Prior to the experiment, 147 Iranian EFL learners and 43 American native English speakers were asked {{to participate in the study}} to help the researchers develop the instruments. To carry out the study, the researchers matched 60 Iranian EFL learners in two groups based on their scores on the Oxford Placement Test (2004). The groups were then randomly assigned to instructional conditions, namely the DIG task and the recast. Findings demonstrated that participants in both tasks preformed significantly better in the immediate and delayed posttests than in the pretest. The results also revealed that neither the effects of instructional treatment nor the effects of time were significant between the groups on the perception and production measures. Similarly, participants in both groups maintained the positive effects of the treatment in the delayed posttest on the same measures. For the recognition measure, although the effects of treatment were marginally significant in favor of the participants in the DIG task, they could not maintain the positive effects of treatment in the delayed posttest. This rendered the effect of time non-significant on this measure...|$|R
40|$|Studies in interlanguage {{pragmatics}} {{have shown}} that L 2 learners’ proficiency {{has an influence on}} the occurrences of L 1 pragmatic transfer. However, questions remain whether the relationship between L 1 pragmatic transfer and L 2 proficiency is positive or negative. This paper is designed to study L 1 pragmatic transfer in requests made by Chinese learners of English at low L 2 proficiency level and at high L 2 proficiency level and how L 1 pragmatic transfer is related to their L 2 proficiency. Ten low proficiency learners of English, ten high proficiency learners of English?ten native speakers of English and ten native speakers of Chinese participate in this study. Requests are collected by means of a discourse completion test questionnaire and are analysed in terms of requestive semantic formulas based on the taxonomy of request strategies, internal modifiers and external modifiers. The research results reveal that L 1 pragmatic transfer decreases with the increase of L 2 proficiency such as learners’ use of direct strategies, lexical and phrasal <b>downgraders,</b> imperatives and grounder and no clear relationship is found between L 1 pragmatic transfer and L 2 proficiency in terms of the other request strategies, internal modifiers and external modifiers. These results provide partial support to negative correlation hypothesis —high proficiency L 2 learners are less likely to transfer their native language pragmatic norms since they have enough control over L 2. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{speech act}} of request {{is a common}} speech act used in every day interactions. However, because of its nature to impose on other people, it is very {{important}} that people select the appropriate strategy in making requests. There are several factors that may influence the production of requests, one of them is the gender of the speaker. This study is an attempt investigate how Indonesian male and female learners of English make English requests. To collect the data, a questionnaire in the form of a Discourse Completion Test (DCT) is distributed to the respondents. The DCT consists of six scenarios that reflect different social situations, each with different combinations of close / distant social distance, and high / equal / low power between the interlocutors. From this, the respondents are to produce requests based on the different social situations presented in each of the scenarios. The DCT is distributed to students of the English Language and Culture Department at Bunda Mulia University. The total number of respondents is 70 people, which consists of 35 males and 35 females. The findings of the study reveal that both gender groups employ similar request strategies and modifications throughout the six scenarios, with only slight differences. First of all, the most frequently used request strategy is the query preparatory. This strategy, modified by questions and modals, is the preferred strategy for both male and female students. Additionally, in terms of modifiers, the most preferred <b>downgraders</b> for both gender groups are politeness markers please and supportive reasons. From these request strategies and modifications, it can be said that the females are more indirect than the males in their production of requests. ...|$|R
