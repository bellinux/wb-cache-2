5|$|Another {{strike in}} Szczecin broke out on 22 January 1971. In a risky move, Gierek went to Szczecin on 24 January and to Gdańsk the next day. He met the workers personally, apologizing for the {{mistakes}} of the past and saying that as a former worker himself he understood their plight and would now govern Poland for the people. Workers striking in Szczecin formulated demands in the area of freely <b>elected</b> <b>worker</b> <b>councils</b> and union representatives. Gierek agreed, but the authorities soon marginalized and eliminated the worker leaders from the legally existing structures and their places of employment. The February 1971 Łódź strikes followed and concentrated on economic demands. Afterwards prices were lowered, wage increases were announced, and sweeping economic and political changes were promised.|$|R
5|$|These happenings were a first {{cumulation}} {{of a civil}} commotion, {{that had}} started {{a few days earlier}} with large strikes and demonstrations. On 4November 1918, a first workers' council under the leadership of the 23-year-old Spartacist Fritz Rück had been established in Stuttgart. During the following days and weeks more spontaneously <b>elected</b> <b>worker</b> and soldier <b>councils</b> were formed, and took over a large part of Württemberg. Rau was elected leader of the military police in his home city of Zuffenhausen, a part of Stuttgart's urban area.|$|R

In {{the course of}} his internship, he also worked for half a year in cardiac surgery at the German Heart Center of Berlin (Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin). In 1990 he became a full surgical doctor and worked as a senior physician of General and Vascular Surgery at Humboldt Hospital. Albers was elected {{for the first time to}} the <b>worker's</b> <b>council</b> of the Humboldt Hospital in 2000. After the merger of all nine previously public hospitals into the Vivantes group, he again was <b>elected</b> to the <b>worker's</b> <b>council</b> within the concern.

During the Hungarian Soviet Republic he was <b>elected</b> to the <b>Worker's</b> <b>Council.</b> He was a delegate in the Congress of the Hungarian Communist Party in June 1919. He emigrated to Vienna in 1920 and participated in the editing of Bécsi Magyar Újság. He returned to home in 1925 and became a lawyer in 1927.|$|R
5|$|After the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II in 1917, the new Russian Provisional Government in Petrograd {{had little}} {{influence}} over Ukraine. Khrushchev was <b>elected</b> to the <b>worker's</b> <b>council</b> (or soviet) in Rutchenkovo, and in May he became its chairman. He {{did not join}} the Bolsheviks until 1918, {{a year in which}} the Russian Civil War, between the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the White Army, began in earnest. His biographer, William Taubman, suggests that Khrushchev's delay in affiliating himself with the Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the Mensheviks who prioritized economic progress, whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and it was difficult to keep them all straight.|$|R

40|$|Cet article porte sur le modèle de {{participation}} mis en œuvre dans le secteur d'État algérien à compter de 1971. La recherche {{montre que}} ce cadre institutionnel n'a pas résorbé le conflit entre les agents de production, comme le suggérait le discours officiel. Au contraire, le modèle de participation a généré un nouveau type de conflit entre les différents acteurs et instances impliqués dans l'entreprise socialiste. In Algeria, enterprises have been until now creatures of an all powerful government party. These enterprises have been managed in a bureaucratic manner {{by the central}} authority, leading the participants {{to realize that the}} crucial issues were being decided outside their sphere. The socialist model of enterprise (ESA) created through planning initiatives in the state sector beginning in 1971, institutionalized participation. However, because the enterprises into which participation was introduced were traditional organizations based on the division of capital and labour, conflict ensued. Moreover, the model of participation is fundamentally managerially driven. In our view, such models have demonstrated that they are nearly always fatally flawed at resolving workplace conflict. This model of participation proved equally unable to attain the widespread support, within the economic and political Systems, which had been promised at the planning stage. It is equally apparent that the conflict surrounding the ESA was a kind of a mechanism whereby a dominant state party faced a labour movement seeking to end its subservience. The ESA was an instrument through which {{the rules of the game}} could be determined, as each of these groups attempted to modify the situation to its own advantage. At its root, it was simply an exercise for the groups in question: the one to try to perpetuate its domination; the other to set in motion changes that might reverse the status quo. Naturally enough, this led to conflict of a dual character. Not surprisingly, conflict emerged at the workplace level and was played out in an industrial relations context. Conflict was also of a political and strategic nature, however, between actors competing for both organizational and societal power. Certainly the conflict that is evident in ESA has spilled over into other arenas. In this study, we have attempted to identify the relationship between conflict and participation within the ESA model, in terms of both its significance and evolution. We have examined the actors within the ESA to ascertain their objectives and their inter-connections. The ESA model creates a dual relationship between the union and management: on one hand there is a relationship with respect to certain decision making; on the other hand, there is a confrontation al relationship that is euphemistically called "collective disputes of the workplace". One finds, as a resuit, a dialectic of intégration and conflict, which develops into différent forms. In a very real sensé, the ESA model is a forum for the unfolding of two distinct types of conflict. The first type is that which can never be eliminated, but which can be accommodated within a libéral System of enterprise. This type of conflict is concerned with the conditions of employaient and the methods of determining those conditions. The second type of conflict emerged within the ESA model itself. The model is conflictual for three reasons: 1) the ESA was a focus of competition between the two main social actors, the labour movement and the state party; 2) the type of relationship that emerged between the <b>elected</b> <b>workers</b> <b>councils</b> and management. At stake is the retention and exercise of managerial power; and 3) the fact that those at the level of production did not accept the ESA model, and by reference, the state party...|$|R

5000|$|Council Communists {{maintain}} that the working class should not rely on Leninist vanguard parties or hope for reforms of the capitalist system to bring socialism.
