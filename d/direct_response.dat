5|$|The {{work was}} written as a <b>direct</b> <b>response</b> to the Arabic poet Ibn al-Qarih, whom Al-Maʿarri mocks for his {{religious}} views. In this work, the poet visits paradise and meets the Arab poets of the pagan period, contrary to Muslim doctrine {{which holds that}} only {{those who believe in}} God can find salvation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} weekend of sales of the iPad Mini and {{fourth-generation}} iPad, Apple reported that it sold an aggregated number of 3 million units. TechRadar noted that {{the first weekend}} sales figures for the fourth-generation iPad are lower than corresponding figures for the third-generation iPad, which sold 3 million units in its first weekend. Subsequent reports and analysis such as that from David Hsieh, a technology analyst, suggest that the iPad mini is selling better than the fourth-generation iPad. Despite the noted slump in sales, Apple's stock price, in <b>direct</b> <b>response</b> to the figures released, rose by 1.4% to $584.62 on November 5.|$|E
5|$|DraftKings and FanDuel {{also became}} {{known for their}} use of <b>direct</b> <b>response</b> {{advertising}} on television, especially during sports telecasts. Capitalizing on the start of football season, iSpot.tv estimated that DraftKings and FanDuel collectively spent over $107 million on television advertising in September 2015 alone—with nearly half being spent on advertising during National Football League telecasts ($23.6 million by DraftKings, and $26.7 million spent by FanDuel). Of the total, $60.1 million was spent by DraftKings, with $7.95 million spent during college football games, $2.05 million during ESPN's sports news program SportsCenter, and $1.36 million during South Park episodes. The marketing push was met with a negative reaction from viewers on social networks such as Twitter, who considered the repetitive airplay of DFS commercials during football games to be an annoyance.|$|E

5|$|The rapid {{introduction}} of new types of radars working on different frequencies meant the IFF system had to respond to an ever-increasing list of signals, and the <b>direct</b> <b>response</b> of the Mk. II required an ever-increasing number of sub-models, each turned to different frequencies. By 1941 {{it was clear that}} this was going to grow without bound, and a new solution was needed. The result was a new series of IFF units which used the indirect interrogation technique. These operated on a fixed frequency, different from the radar. The interrogation signal was sent from the aircraft by pressing a button on the radar, which caused the signal to be sent out in pulses synchronized to the radar's main signal. The received signal was amplified and mixed into the same video signal as the radar, causing the same extended blip to appear.|$|E
5|$|The {{types of}} {{coevolution}} listed {{so far have}} been described as if they operated pairwise (also called specific coevolution), in which traits of one species have evolved in <b>direct</b> <b>response</b> to traits of a second species, and vice versa. This is not always the case. Another evolutionary mode arises where evolution is still reciprocal, but is among a group of species rather than exactly two. This is called guild or diffuse coevolution. For instance, a trait in several species of flowering plant, such as offering its nectar {{at the end of a}} long tube, can coevolve with a trait in one or several species of pollinating insects, such as a long proboscis. More generally, flowering plants are pollinated by insects from different families including bees, flies, and beetles, all of which form a broad guild of pollinators which respond to the nectar or pollen produced by flowers.|$|E
5|$|On June 19, 2013, Microsoft {{announced}} (in {{response to}} the negative reaction) that it would reverse its changes to Xbox One's DRM and game licensing model. As with Xbox 360, users {{would be able to}} share and resell physical games without restrictions, and beyond a mandatory software update upon the console's initial setup process to enable playback of Blu-ray and DVD video, the console would not require a permanent internet connection to operate. These changes required the family sharing features, along with the ability to play games without their disc after installation, to be dropped. Xbox One chief product officer Marc Whitten stated that the family sharing feature may return in the future, but could not be implemented on launch due to time restraints. Don Mattrick, the then president of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business, stated that the licensing changes were in {{response to the}} negative public reaction. Other analysts believed that the change was in <b>direct</b> <b>response</b> of Sony's aggressive position during its E3 press conference. Mattrick, who had been a leader in Xbox One development, announced his departure from Microsoft on July 1, 2013, to become CEO of Zynga. Analysts speculated that his departure was predicated on the poor response and subsequent reversal of the plans for Xbox One.|$|E

40|$|The {{hyperbolic}} cosine unfolding model for <b>direct</b> <b>responses</b> of persons to individual stimuli is elabo rated in three ways. First, the parameter of the stimu lus, which reflects a region within which people located {{there are more}} likely to respond positively than negatively, is shown to be a property of the data and not arbitrary as first supposed. Second, the model is used to construct a related model for pairwise preferences. This model, for which joint maximum likelihood estimates are derived, satisfies strong sto chastic transitivity. Third, the role of substantive theory in evaluating the fit between the data and the models, in which unique solutions for the estimates are not guaranteed, is explored by analyzing responses of one group of persons to a single set of stimuli obtained both as <b>direct</b> <b>responses</b> and pairwise preferences...|$|R

5|$|Pong was {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Atari. After producing Computer Space, Bushnell decided to form a company to produce more games by licensing ideas to other companies. The first contract was with Bally Manufacturing Corporation for a driving game. Soon after the founding, Bushnell hired Allan Alcorn because of his experience with electrical engineering and computer science; Bushnell and Dabney also had previously worked with him at Ampex. Prior to working at Atari, Alcorn had no experience with video games. To acclimate Alcorn to creating games, Bushnell gave him a project secretly {{meant to be a}} warm-up exercise. Bushnell told Alcorn that he had a contract with General Electric for a product, and asked Alcorn to create a simple game with one moving spot, two paddles, and digits for score keeping. In 2011, Bushnell stated that the game was inspired by previous versions of electronic tennis he had played before; Bushnell played a version on a PDP-1 computer in 1964 while attending college. However, Alcorn has claimed it was in <b>direct</b> <b>response</b> to Bushnell's viewing of the Magnavox Odyssey's Tennis game. In May 1972, Bushnell had visited the Magnavox Profit Caravan in Burlingame, California where he played the Magnavox Odyssey demonstration, specifically the table tennis game. Though he thought the game lacked quality, seeing it prompted Bushnell to assign the project to Alcorn.|$|E
5|$|When Aristagoras {{organized}} the Ionian Revolt, Eretria and Athens supported him by sending ships and troops to Ionia and by burning Sardis. Persian military and naval operations {{to quell the}} revolt ended in the Persian reoccupation of Ionian and Greek islands, {{as well as the}} re-subjugation of Thrace and the conquering of Macedonia in 492 BC under Mardonius. Macedon had been a vassal kingdom of the Persians since the late 6th century BC, but retained autonomy. Mardonius' 492 campaign made it a fully subordinate part of the Persian kingdom. These military actions, coming as a <b>direct</b> <b>response</b> to the revolt in Ionia, were the beginning of the First Persian invasion of (mainland) Greece. At the same time, anti-Persian parties gained more power in Athens, and pro-Persian aristocrats were exiled from Athens and Sparta. Darius responded by sending troops led by his son-in-law across the Hellespont. However, a violent storm and harassment by the Thracians forced the troops to return to Persia. Seeking revenge on Athens and Eretria, Darius assembled another army of 20,000 men under his Admiral, Datis, and his nephew Artaphernes, who met success when they captured Eretria and advanced to Marathon. In 490 BCE, at the Battle of Marathon, the Persian army was defeated by a heavily armed Athenian army, with 9,000 men who were supported by 600 Plataeans and 10,000 lightly armed soldiers led by Miltiades.|$|E

40|$|<b>Direct</b> and {{correlated}} <b>responses</b> to {{selection for}} weight gain were investigated after nine generations of within family selection. Four selection criteria were used: gain between 28 and 38 or 48 and 58 days of age, and under two feeding regimes, ad libitum consumption or restricted to 80 % of control lines. Two lines consisting each of twenty pair matings were selected under {{each of these}} criteria. Two unselected control lines were kept. Carcass composition analyses were performed in generation nine {{at the beginning and}} end of each selection period and at 100 days of age. <b>Direct</b> <b>responses</b> to selection in the first period were greater in the ad libitum lines while in the second period <b>direct</b> <b>responses</b> were greater in the restricted lines. <b>Direct</b> <b>responses</b> and realized heritability estimates were significantly different between the sexes; males had greater <b>direct</b> <b>responses</b> and higher heritabilities in all selected lines. Body weights before the selection periods decreased in all lines as a result of selection. Body weights after the selection period were not different from controls in the ad libitum lines while restricted lines remained smaller animals. Correlated responses in feed efficiency and feed consumption in the ad libitum lines were positive in the first period and negative in the second period. Restricted lines had a positive response in feed efficiency and negative response in consumption in both periods of selection. Changes in body composition in the first period reflected the changes in body weights through a lower crude protein percentage at the start of the period and a lower ash percentage at the end of the period. Body composition at the start of the second period was not altered by selection, while at the end of the selection period ad libitum lines had higher dry matter percentages and restricted lines had lower fat percentages. Body composition at 100 days of age was not affected by selection except for dry matter percent, that was lower in the restricted lines. Correlated response in fitness was evaluated through litter size. In the first period lines selected under ad libitum feeding were not affected by selection for increased weight gain while selection for weight gain under restricted feeding caused a significant decrease in litter size...|$|R
50|$|The {{use of the}} ICS/UC as a {{management}} tool does not relieve the On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) of her or his obligation to direct, monitor, and coordinate response actions.
