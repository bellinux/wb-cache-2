Handing out weapons would be illegal. The CNT and UGT proclaimed a general strike, in effect mobilising. They opened weapons caches, some buried since the 1934 risings.

5|$|In {{most species}} the sexes are separate, {{but all the}} {{freshwater}} species are hermaphroditic. Nemerteans often have numerous temporary gonads (ovaries or testes), and build temporary gonoducts (ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted), one per gonad, when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, and others protect their eggs in various ways. The fertilized egg divides by spiral cleavage and grows by determinate development, in which the <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cell can usually be predicted from its predecessors {{in the process of}} division. The embryos of most taxa develop either directly to form juveniles (like the adult but smaller) or to form planuliform larvae, in which the larva's long axis {{is the same as the}} juvenile's. However, some form a pilidium larva, in which the developing juvenile has a gut which lies across the larva's body, and usually eats the remains of the larva when it emerges. The bodies of some species fragment readily, and even parts near the tail can grow full bodies.|$|E

25|$|After {{the defeat}} of Saakadze {{and the death of}} Shah Abbas I in 1629, Teimuraz {{proceeded}} to strengthen his authority in eastern Georgia. He instigated Zurab of Aragvi to murder Semayun Khan, an Iranian-appointed rival king of Kartli in 1630, and then had Zurab assassinated, thereby getting rid of them both. By the early 1630s, Teimuraz I had gained more or less stable control of both Kartli and Kakheti. Determined to eliminate the Safavid hegemony over Georgia, Teimuraz sent his ambassador, Niciphores Irbachi, to Western Europe and requested the aid from Philip IV of Spain and Pope Urban VIII. However, the rulers of Europe were too involved in the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) {{to be concerned about the}} <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small Caucasian kingdom, and nothing came of this mission, the publication of the first Georgian printed book Dittionario giorgiano e italiano ("Georgian-Italian Dictionary"; Rome, 1629) by Stefano Paolini and Niciphores Irbachi being the only result of this embassy.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "speed campaign" [...] (MR: sokto-jon) {{calls for}} rapid {{production}} of films. According to Kim Jong-il, by producing films {{as fast as}} possible, the overall revolutionary process is expedited. The origins of the speed campaign are in the shooting of The <b>Fate</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Self-Defence Corps Man in just 40 days when it was anticipated to take a full year. The practice was carried out after publication of On the Art of the Cinema, too. For instance, the eight-part film series Unsung Heroes (1979–1981) was produced by following the speed campaign principle. Each film took just 45 days to produce. Subsequently speed campaigns {{have been carried out}} not only in art, but also economic matters. It was thought of as equally important with Kim Il-sung's Chollima Movement, and remains an influential concept associated with Kim Jong-il's leadership.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Ultra Jump Egg, Urobuchi gave insight into his writing philosophy, stating that he believed the overarching plot of a story {{was more important than}} the characters within it.

He again defended his decision to have Mami die, claiming that this could actually have the converse effect of making her character even more memorable, saying, [...] "I think there are quite many characters who became immortal exactly because they died, like Caesar Zeppeli in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure or Raoh in Fist of the North Star. Precisely {{because of the way they}} died, they were able to live forever." ...|$|E

500|$|In more {{concrete}} terms, the seed {{is the basis}} of the propaganda message of the film: [...] "a strong, convincing idea of what to tell". The seed synthesizes the subject matter and the idea of a work, thus providing both the form and content. In this capacity, it fuses together the Marxist–Leninist literary theory concepts of [...] "material", [...] "theme" [...] and [...] "thought". The film should contribute to the ruling ideology and employ aesthetics and storytelling that support the propaganda message. For example, the seed of film The <b>Fate</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Self-Defence Corps Man revolves around the choice facing the main character, Gap Ryong: to perish under oppression or sacrificing one's self for the revolution. Its seed could be summarized as [...] "whether or not Gap Ryong participates in the revolutionary movement, he dies". Surplus value, Kim argues, is the seed of Marx's [...]|$|E
500|$|The zygote (fertilised egg) divides by spiral {{cleavage}} {{and grows}} by determinate development, {{in which the}} <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cell can usually be predicted from its predecessors {{in the process of}} division. The embryos of most taxa develop either directly to form juveniles (like the adult but smaller) or to form planuliform larvae, in which the larva's long axis {{is the same as the}} juvenile's. The planuliform larva stage may be short-lived and lecithotrophic ("yolky") before becoming a juvenile, or may be planktotrophic, swimming for some time and eating prey larger than microscopic particles. However, many members of the order Heteronemertea and the palaeonemertean family Hubrechtidae form a pilidium larva, which can capture unicellular algae and which Maslakova describes as like a deerstalker cap with the ear flaps pulled down. It has a gut which lies across the body, a mouth between the [...] "ear flaps", but no anus. A small number of imaginal discs form, encircling the archenteron (developing gut) and coalesce to form the juvenile. When it is fully formed, the juvenile bursts out of the larva body and usually eats it during this catastrophic metamorphosis.|$|E

Both Isaac Shelby and Benjamin Logan had hoped to lead the campaign, and neither would accept a lesser position. Shelby nevertheless supported the campaign, while Logan actively opposed it. Scott issued a call for volunteers to assemble at Frankfort, Kentucky, on May 15, 1791, to carry out these raids. Kentuckians responded favorably {{to the idea of}} an all-militia campaign, and 852 men volunteered for service, although Scott was only authorized to take 750; Senator John Brown was among the volunteers. After a brief delay to learn the <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> failed diplomatic mission to the Miami tribes in the Northwest Territory, Scott's men departed from Fort Washington on May 24. The militiamen crossed the Ohio toward a clutch of Miami, Kickapoo, Wea, and Potawatomi settlements near the location of present-day Lafayette, Indiana. For eight days, they crossed rugged terrain and were bedraggled by frequent rainstorms. The harsh conditions spoiled the militia's supplies, and they resorted to gathering the blackberries that were growing in the area; for this reason, the expedition earned the nickname the [...] "Blackberry Campaign".|$|E
