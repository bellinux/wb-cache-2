40|$|The {{investigation}} {{is devoted to}} the development of the economic numerical methods for solution of the one-dimensional and planned equations for equation of the small water and one of the up-to-date non-linear-dispersion model of the second approximation. The methods for construction of the dynamic-adaptive grids by means of the method of equal distribution are the important part of the developed algorithms. The created algorithms are a base of the program complex for designs of the surfave waves in the fields with curvilinear boundaries. The numerical investigation on the oblique <b>dead</b> <b>floor</b> of the isolated wave on the vertical wall has been made, the wave processes in the complex shape reservoir have been investigated.

40|$|This {{demonstration}} project studied {{the differences in}} farrowing crate designs and the survival of piglets. Three basic crate designs were studied: crates with hydraulic side rails, crates with solid rod finger side rails, and freestall crates. Crates with hydraulic sides in this study had more pigs born alive, had fewer pigs born dead, weaned more pigs, and had higher weaned litter weights than any other crate studied. The freestall crates had the least number of pigs born alive, weaned fewest pigs, and had the lightest litter weaned weights. Freestall crates fell {{in the middle of}} hydraulic and solid rod crates for pigs born dead. The solid rod crates fell in the middle of hydraulic and freestall crates for pigs born alive and weaned litter weight. Solid rod crates weaned slightly more pigs than freestalls. Solid rod crates had the most number of pigs born <b>dead.</b> <b>Flooring</b> layout was not replicated for all crate designs. Although flooring may have had an influence on the results it was not measurable in this study...|$|R
