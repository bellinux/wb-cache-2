In addition, we find that the community-related and economy-related indicators serve to distinguish the reported quality-of-life conditions of rural and urban localities most, whereas the scores for transport are uniquely superior for urban areas, especially London. In considering the policy implications of our results, we draw attention to Labour’s much-trumpeted justice-based approach to sustainable development, and contemplate the viability of the Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition government’s ‘Big Society’ endeavour. ...|$|R

Trade Union regulations must be suspended; employers' profits must be limited, skilled men must fight, if not in the trenches, in the factories; man-power must be economize by the dilution of labour and the employment of women; Private factories must pass {{under the control of the}} State, and new national factories be set up. Results justified the new policy: the output was prodigious; the goods were at last delivered.Following the creation of the Ministry of Munitions, new munitions factories began to be built across the country for the mass production of munitions. The construction of these factories took time and in order to ensure that there was no delay in the production of munitions to deal with the Shell Crisis, the Government turned to railway companies to manufacture materials of war. Railway companies were well placed to manufacture munitions and other war materials, with their large locomotive and carriage works and skilled labourers, and by the end of 1915 the railway companies were producing between 1,000 and 5,000 6-inch.

5|$|The planned coup {{was criticized}} by historians as {{unrealistic}} {{for the following}} reasons. Piłsudski's plan was based on false assumptions and faulty intelligence, which incorrectly indicated that the Sleževičius government was deeply unpopular, and that the general Lithuanian population was relatively friendly to Poland. No notable ethnic Lithuanian politicians declared support for the plan; the plan relied on support from General Žukauskas, but his support was never confirmed; Narutowicz, who was to head the civilian government, was a Pole; the PMO was weak and incapable of taking control if the coup met any significant resistance; and intervention of the Polish army would have led to bloodshed and undermined {{the idea of a}} voluntary union or alliance with Poland. The only group that supported the coup was the Polish minority in Lithuania, increasingly alienated by Lithuanian <b>government</b> <b>policies.</b> However, <b>according</b> to the Lithuanian census of 1923, the minority constituted 3.2% of the population outside the Vilnius Region. On the ground, the uprising was doomed by poor communication and the overeagerness of some of the PMO activists.|$|R
50|$|Youth in {{the twenty-first}} century are more highly educated than in {{previous}} decades due to the expansion of youth educational opportunities since the end of apartheid.

Secondary school enrollment has increased for disadvantaged groups. Despite this, few gains have been made in decreasing the number of young people with little or no education.

40|$|Different from {{previous}} policy recommendations {{to expand the}} use of KHR in the future, the research report “Dollarization in Cambodia: Evidence from a Survey conducted in 2014 - 2015 ”clearly recognizes that the successful repression of dollarization needs policy instruments effectively suppressing the net work externality of dollar payments. The contribution of this research report is to propose explicitly for the first time, in addition to conventional market based policy measures proposed so far, the more instructive and mandate measures such as encouraging firms and sellers to quote price and make payment in KHR, requiring financial institutions to increase operations in KHR, making fiscal measures in KHR, and requiring assistance with the expenditures of donors and NGO projects in KHR, etc., which are useful for restricting the network externality of dollar based payments. On {{the extension of the}} same recognition, we can expect financing in KHR for rural regions targeted by the <b>government</b> <b>policy,</b> since <b>according</b> to the results of the NBC-JICA survey local transactions in agricultural products are as of now unfamiliar with the present dollarized financial system. Through the expansion of finance in KHR, which would create a KHR-denominated payment network, we may expect further expansion {{in the use of the}} KHR due to its network externalities. Dollarization of the Cambodian economy has the nature of a Nash equilibrium, with the network externality of dollar payments as its underpinnings. <b>Government</b> <b>policies</b> to increase the use of KHR (the Khmer riel) would cause great friction through institutional change, and the possibility of strong reactionary forces seeking to restore the current development path is high...|$|R

The paper also presents an analysis of the possibilities and limits of the Healthy Family Project – an initiative of the Medical School of Campos, RJ – as a possible strategy for intervening on social determinants of health. Although approached as a case study, it presents possible solutions for other health care projects oriented by the Family Health Strategy (FHS), a Federal <b>Government</b> health <b>policy.</b> <b>According</b> to data from the Federal Government, by the year 2007 there were a total of 27 324 family health teams in 5125 municipalities, covering 46. 6 % of the population – about 87. 7 million people (Ministry of Health, 2009).

40|$|Typically {{in discussions}} of {{entrepreneurship}} the emphasis is predominantly economic (Morris, quoted in Dechant and Lamky, 2005, 123) although social entrepreneurship is developing as an important field. While there are acknowledged social effects (increased levels of employment being a major one) {{the primary goal of}} entrepreneurship is economic, from which social effects can flow. However, {{in the case of the}} United Arab Emirates (UAE), entrepreneurship is seen as a potential solution to a social problem first, with economic effects secondary. Due to the high levels of unemployment of the National population (19. 7 % for women, 8. 2 % for men) and the structure of the labour market new venture establishment is seen potentially as a way of reducing these high levels of unemployment while adding to the already rapid rate of economic development of the country. Economic growth in the UAE has seen real GDP growth rates of 11. 8 percent in 2003 and 7. 4 percent in 2004, with a GDP per capita of $US 20, 000 approximately (UAE Handbook, 2006, 4) making the UAE one of the fastest growing and wealthiest economies in the Middle East. These growth rates are not without their problems. Among the most pressing for the government of the UAE is the need to find employment for many of its citizens. In a country with a total labour force of 2. 47 million only 254, 000 (10. 2 percent) are Nationals, Of the 10. 2 percent of nationals 183, 000 are men, and 71, 000 are women (Human Resources Report, 2005, Chapter 2). The imbalance in the labour markets are due mainly to the employment of significant numbers of expatriates, predominantly from Asian (Indian and Pakistan) and other Middle Easter countries (Egypt, Lebanon, and Syria). While the imbalance can be attributed to differential wage levels between expatriates and Nationals, the lower labour costs have made employment of Nationals costly. Contributing to the unemployment rates are the expectations of the Nationals themselves. Consistently they refuse to consider taking jobs which would demean their status as Nationals and part of a collective elite. <b>Government</b> <b>policies</b> have also had a part to play. As a result of <b>government</b> <b>policies,</b> which treat both men and women equally, the number of women accessing higher education is significantly higher than men - approximately 66 percent of all students at tertiary level are women. These women are also part of a society which is undergoing significant social changes, with many women opting to seek careers rather than fulfilling the traditional roles of wife and mother. However, not only are women battling against centuries of tradition, they also have to compete in with cheap labour from India and Pakistan. Emirati men and women have high expectations in relation to salary and conditions than do many of the expatriate workers. Even though the purchasing price parity of expatriate workers in the Emirates is low, in Indian terms the purchasing price parity of Emiratii wages are significantly higher than that of wages in India (assuming there are jobs available in the first place). These social and economic conditions have combined to create difficulties for a National Government which is seeking ways to find employment for their citizens while at the same time is loathe to take direct action to ensure preference for the employment of Nationals. Even though there are laws imposing quotas in specific industries (banking, insurance, and trade) government has a preference for self regulation by industry (although there are some signs this might be changing). One policy initiative being supported by the government is the creation of new business ventures as a way of creating employment opportunities for their citizens. Given the way in which the labour market is structured in relation to gender issues, women have been the main beneficiaries of this <b>government</b> <b>policy.</b> <b>According</b> to a recent report by the National Employment Agency (Tanmia 2004) women have been creating their own employment opportunities in greater numbers than men.

This paper reexamines the effects of <b>government</b> <b>policies</b> on market imperfections and foreign direct investment (FDI). It broadens and refines {{the analysis of the}} impact of <b>government</b> <b>policies</b> by developing the following arguments: (1) There is a wide range of <b>government</b> <b>policies</b> that affect firms′ FDI decisions via their effects on market imperfections. (2) There are numerous dimensions of variability in <b>government</b> <b>policies</b> that need to be identified in order to understand fully the effects of <b>government</b> <b>policies</b> on market imperfections and hence FDI flows.
