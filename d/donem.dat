Policy makers and many researchers {{are interested in}} predicting and monitoring misalignment in the foreign exchange market, because, in many cases, it {{is closely related to}} possible current account problems or impending currency crises. This study mainly aims to discuss the sensitivity of estimation results to the alternative combinations of different actual real exchange rate indices and equilibrium definitions, by using quarterly data from 1987 to 2003 for Turkish lira. The 16 measures of misalignment employed in this study show that the differences between these alternative measures vary between 6. 5 and 36. 5 percent points, which actually is a strong indication for high sensitivity of the degree of misalignment to the combination of the actual real exchange rate index and the definition of its long-run level.

He gave many works in many kinds of literature such as poetry, story, study, and novel and some of his works are accepted as the first samples of the time when he lived. For example, the author brought into being the first socialist realist work through “Aygıtlı Edim” of 1940 and the first autobiographical novel through “Öten Günler” of 1974. Öten Günler is his latest novel {{in addition to being a}} work which he wrote in his old age. In this work, Kerbabayev deals with the time when he lived from 1884, the year of his birth, or in other words, his childhood to 1925. The incidents which the author experienced between the years of 1894 - 1925 (for example the place of his birth, his family and his education) and the events which he witnessed are conveyed through the main character, Mırat in an ingenious narrative. Öten Günler is a literary document which declares especially education, corrupt religious institutions, political structure and cultural change in society between 1884 and 1925. This study will reveal social background of the work which mirrors the period when great changes had been experienced and is the witness of the period while the information on Turkmen people given through Kerbabayev’s eyes in Öten Günler is sociologically examined under these titles: 1.

40|$|Aquest treball és una contribució a l'estudi de diferents problemes que sorgeixen de dues àrees fortament connexes de la Teoria de Grafs: etiquetaments i descomposicions. Molts etiquetaments de grafs deuen el seu origen als presentats l'any 1967 per Rosa. Un d'aquests etiquetaments, àmpliament conegut com a etiquetament graceful, va ser definit originalment com a eina per atacar la conjectura de Ringel, la qual diu que el graf complet d'ordre 2 m+ 1 pot ser descompost en m copies d'un arbre donat de mida m. Aquí, estudiem etiquetaments relacionats que ens donen certes aproximacions a la conjectura de Ringel, així com també a una altra conjectura de Graham i Häggkvist que, en una forma dèbil, demana la descomposició d'un graf bipartit complet per un arbre donat de mida apropiada. Les {{principals}} contribucions que hem fet en aquest tema són la prova de la darrera conjectura per grafs bipartits complets del doble de mida essent descompostos per arbres de gran creixement i un nombre primer d'arestes, i la prova del fet que cada arbre és un subarbre gran de dos arbres pels quals les dues conjectures es compleixen respectivament. Aquests resultats estan principalment basats en una aplicació del mètode polinomial d'Alon. Un altre tipus d'etiquetaments, els etiquetaments magic, també són tractats aquí. Motivats per la noció de quadrats màgics de Teoria de Nombres, en aquest tipus d'etiquetaments volem asignar nombres {{enters a}} parts del graf (vèrtexs, arestes, o vèrtexs i arestes) de manera que la suma de les etiquetes assignades a certes subestructures del graf sigui constant. Desenvolupem tècniques basades en particions de certs conjunts d'enters amb algunes condicions additives per construir etiquetaments cycle-magic, un nou tipus d'etiquetament introduït en aquest treball i que estén la noció clàssica d'etiquetament magic. Els etiquetaments magic no donen cap descomposició de grafs, però les tècniques usades per obtenir-los estan al nucli d'un altre problema de descomposició, l'ascending subgraph decomposition (ASD). Alavi, Boals, Chartrand, Erdös i Oellerman, van conjecturar l'any 1987 que tot graf té un ASD. Aquí, estudiem l'ASD per grafs bipartits, una classe de grafs per la qual la conjectura encara no ha estat provada. <b>Donem</b> una condició necessària i una de suficient sobre la seqüència de graus d'un estable del graf bipartit de manera que admeti un ASD en que cada factor sigui un star forest. Les tècniques utilitzades estan basades en l'existència de branca-acoloriments en multigrafs bipartits. També tractem amb el sumset partition problem, motivat per la conjectura ASD, que demana una partició de [n] de manera que la suma dels elements de cada part sigui igual a un valor prescrit. Aquí <b>donem</b> la millor condició possible per la versió modular del problema que ens permet provar els millors resultats ja coneguts en el cas enter per n primer. La prova està de nou basada en el mètode polinomial. This {{work is a}} contribution to the study of various problems that arise from two strongly connected areas of the Graph Theory: graph labelings and graph decompositions. Most graph labelings trace their origins to the ones presented in 1967 by Rosa. One of these labelings, widely known as the graceful labeling, originated as a means of attacking the conjecture of Ringel, which states that the complete graph of order 2 m+ 1 can be decomposed into m copies of a given tree of size m. Here, we study related labelings that give some approaches to Ringel's conjecture, as well as to another conjecture by Graham and Häggkvist that, in a weak form, asks for the decomposition of a complete bipartite graph by a given tree of appropriate size. Our main contributions in this topic are the proof of the latter conjecture for double sized complete bipartite graphs being decomposed by trees with large growth and prime number of edges, and the proof of the fact that every tree is a large subtree of two trees for which both conjectures hold respectively. These results are mainly based on a novel application of the so-called polynomial method by Alon. Another kind of labelings, the magic labelings, are also treated. Motivated by the notion of magic squares in Number Theory, in these type of labelings we want to assign integers to the parts of a graph (vertices, edges, or vertices and edges) {{in such a way that}} the sums of the labels assigned to certain substructures of the graph remain constant. We develop techniques based on partitions of certain sets of integers with some additive conditions to construct cycle-magic labelings, a new brand introduced in this work that extends the classical magic labelings. Magic labelings do not provide any graph decomposition, but the techniques that we use to obtain them are the core of another decomposition problem, the ascending subgraph decomposition (ASD). In 1987, was conjectured by Alavi, Boals. Chartrand, Erdös and Oellerman that every graph has an ASD. Here, we study ASD of bipartite graphs, a class of graphs for which the conjecture has not been shown to hold. We give a necessary and a sufficient condition on the one sided degree sequence of a bipartite graph in order that it admits an ASD by star forests. Here the techniques are based on the existence of edge-colorings in bipartite multigraphs. Motivated by the ASD conjecture we also deal with the sumset partition problem, which asks for a partition of [n] in such a way that the sum of the elements of each part is equal to a prescribed value. We give a best possible condition for the modular version of the sumset partition problem that allows us to prove the best known results in the integer case for n a prime. The proof is again based on the polynomial method...|$|E
40|$|It {{would not}} be wrong to state that village {{literature}} in Turkeyappeared as a branch of “Into the Village” movementand under theinfluence of “Populism” ideology {{that emerged in the}} beginning ofRepublic period. However, this literature, though it came out with asocial realist claim, gained an ecclectic structure as it was affected byNarodnik literature in Russia at that time on one hand and by the“rusticism” movement bearing naturalistic features, which had startedearlier on the other. During the Village Institutes movement in 1940 s in Turkey, withthe literature created by the authors graduated from these schools,village and villagers were first voiced “emically” by these authors whowere born and grew up in the village. This movement powered by theslogan of the Republic ideology, “Villagers are our masters,” took strongroots in Turkish literature starting from 1950 s. However, as of 1970 s,parallel to the social change and urbanization it gradually weakenedand in a sense, disappeared. Yet, due tothe naturalistic characteristic ofvillage literature and the authors of this movement, who attached aspecial importance to the mission of “saving the society,” the worksproduced within this movement are said to have been important interms of village sociology. Within this framework, the prominent figuresof this movement maintained that the work of art produced during thismovement had “documentary” quality. However, to what extent this literature reflected the village andthe villager realistically is still controversial. When looked at from apoint of reflecting the village realism, {{it can be seen that}} this literaturecreated by the authors of Village Instituteis not in line with what is real. Undoubtedly, the reason why we, as readers, were not able to see whatwas experienced in the society then is closely related to the author’sendavour to incorporate his/her political views into his/her work. If wewere to express the village literature created by the villager-authors in aLukacsian discourse, “reality, even contrary to one’s opinions, hopesand beliefs, has to be depicted with an unwavering honesty. ” Türkiye’de köy edebiyatının, Cumhuriyet dönemi başlarında ortaya çıkan “Halkçılık” ideolojisinin etkileri altında ve “Köye Doğru” akımının bir kolu olarak ortaya çıktığını söylemek yanlış olmayacaktır. Ne var ki bu edebiyat, toplumcu gerçekçi bir iddia ile ortaya çıkmasına karşın, bir yandan kendisinden önce başlamış olan naturalist “köycü”lük akımından bir yandan da o <b>dönem</b> Rusya’sında görülen narodnik edebiyattan etkiler alarak eklektik bir yapı kazanmıştır. 1940 ’larda Türkiye’de yaşanan Köy Enstitüleri ortamında, bu okullardan mezun olan yazarlar tarafından oluşturulan bu edebiyat ile ilk kez köy ve köylü, kökeni köy olan yazarlar tarafından ve “içerden” dile getirilmiştir. Cumhuriyet ideolojisinin “Köylü efendimizdir” sloganından da güç alan bu akım 1950 ’lerden itibaren Türk edebiyatında güçlü bir yer kazanmıştır. Gelgelelim, gerek köy edebiyatının naturalist niteliği ve gerekse bu akımdan yazarların toplumu kurtarma “ misyon”una özel bir önem vermeleri bir zaaf da oluşturmuştur. Bu arada, Enstitülü yazarların oluşturduğu köy edebiyatının reel toplumla her zaman uyum içinde olmadığı da görülmektedir. Hiç şüphesiz reel toplumda yaşanan süreçleri bu yapıtlarda her zaman birebir göremeyişimizin nedeni yazarların, edebiyat yapıtlarına kişisel düşüncelerini koymalarıyla ilişkisi vardır. Bu nedenle, Köy enstitülü yazarların oluşturduğu köy edebiyatının, -Lukacs’çı bir söylemle ifade edersek-, toplumsal gerçeklik umutlarına ve isteklerine karşı gitse de onu betimlemedeki “sarsılmaz dürüstlüğü” gösterip gösterememeleri de irdelenmelidir...|$|E

Every time we give more importance to {{the profile of the}} student and the teacher and I thought it important to assess how a future teacher creates interactive whiteboard activities and relate it to their profile. The profile of the teacher or teachers of the future in this case I determined from the parameters and variables and their pattern of learning and perception of digital competence. In the training of future teachers in the curriculum of the URV we like competition: understand the educational implications of information technology and communication (ICT).. It {{is for this reason that}} knowledge of tools and resources ICT, for use in the classroom is a priority. Also we believe that the interactive whiteboard (IW) is a resource that ICT has emerged stronger in the context of education and training in recent years on the computer. We are currently promoting their use in the classroom because it offers more possibilities than the computer, mainly because it allows viewing of contents provides more interactivity and group classes. For these reasons we consider interesting to assess how future teachers create activities for this tool. I used these activities to assess variables such as time of the activity, teaching models used, type of goal it wants to achieve, and functionality of the interactive whiteboard that should be used. As an organization and structure of this thesis is organized into 6 chapters of which the first three chapters provide the theoretical basis and the three subsequent research process as described below: 1 : ICT and education. This chapter starts by defining the conceptLa present tesis és un treball d’investigació realitzat a la Universitat Rovira i Virgili de Tarragona sobre la creació d’activitats per pissarra digital interactiva i el perfil dels futurs docents que les han creat.

El perfil del docent o en aquest cas del futur docent l’he determinat a partir de paràmetres i variables com el seu patró d’aprenentatge i la seva percepció de competència digital. En la formació dels futurs docents en el currículum de la URV tenim com a competència: Conèixer les implicacions educatives de les tecnologies de la informació i la comunicació.. És per aquesta raó que el coneixement d’eines i recursos TIC (Tecnologies de la informació i la comunicació) per a l’ús a l’aula és una prioritat. Així mateix hem cregut que la pissarra digital interactiva (PDI) és un dels recursos TIC que ha irromput amb més força en el context de l'educació i formació en els últims anys després de l’ordinador. En l’actualitat s’està potenciant el seu ús a les aules degut a que ofereix més possibilitats que l’ordinador, sobretot perquè permet visionar els continguts en grup i aporta més interactivitat a les classes. Per aquestes raons valorem com a molt interessant avaluar com els futurs docents creen activitats per aquesta eina. Per avaluar aquestes activitats he utilitzat variables com el temps de l’activitat, els models didàctics utilitzats, tipus d’objectiu que pretén assolir, i funcionalitat de la pissarra digital interactiva que s’haurà d’utilitzar.

40|$|This is a {{contribution}} to combinatorial set theory, specifically to infinite Ramsey Theory, which deals with partitions of infinite sets. The basic pigeon hole principle states that for every partition of the set of all natural numbers in finitely many classes there is an infinite set of natural numbers that is included in some one class. Ramsey’s Theorem, which {{can be seen as}} a generalization of this simple result, is about partitions of the set [N]k of all k-element sets of natural numbers. It states that for every k ≥ 1 and every partition of [N]k into finitely many classes, there is an infinite subset M of N such that all k-element subsets of M belong to some same class. Such a set is said to be homogeneous for the partition. In Ramsey’s own formulation (Ramsey, [8], p. 264), the theorem reads as follows. Theorem (Ramsey). Let Γ be an infinite class, and μ and r positive numbers; and let all those sub-classes of Γ which have exactly r numbers, or, as we may say, let all r−combinations of the members of Γ be divided in any manner into μ mutually exclusive classes Ci (i = 1, 2,..., μ), so that every r−combination is a member of one and only one Ci; then assuming the axiom of selections, Γ must contain an infinite sub-class △ such that all the r−combinations of the members of △ belong to the same Ci. In [5], Neil Hindman proved a Ramsey-like result that was conjectured by Graham and Rotschild in [3]. Hindman’s Theorem asserts that if the set of all natural numbers is divided into two classes, one of the classes contains an infinite set such that all finite sums of distinct members of the set remain in the same class. Hindman’s original proof was greatly simplified, though the same basic ideas were used, by James Baumgartner in [1]. We will give new proofs of these two theorems which rely on forcing arguments. After this, we will be concerned with the particular partial orders used in each case, with the aim of studying its basic properties and its relations to other similar forcing notions. The partial order used to get Ramsey’s Theorem will be seen to be equivalent to Mathias forcing. The analysis of the partial order arising in the proof of Hindmans Theorem, which we denote by PFIN, will be object of the last chapter of the thesis. A summary of our work follows. In the first chapter we give some basic definitions and state several known theorems that we will need. We explain the set theoretic notation used and we describe some forcing notions that will be useful in the sequel. Our notation is generally standard, and when it is not it will be sufficiently explained. This work is meant to be self-contained. Thus, although most of the theorems recorded in this first, preliminary chapter, will be stated without proof, it will be duly indicated where a proof can be found. Chapter 2 is devoted to a proof of Ramsey’s Theorem in which forcing is used to produce a homogeneous set for the relevant partition. The partial order involved is isomorphic to Mathias forcing. In Chapter 3 we modify Baumgartner’s proof of Hindman’s Theorem to define a partial order, denoted by PC, from which we get by a forcing argument a suitable homogeneous set. Here C is an infinite set of finite subsets of N, and PC adds an infinite block sequence of finite subsets of natural numbers with the property that all finite unions of its elements belong to C. Our proof follows closely Baumgartner’s. The partial order PC is similar both to the one due to Matet in [6] and to Mathias forcing. This prompts the question whether it is equivalent to one of them or to none, which can only be solved by studying PC, which we do in chapter 4. In chapter 4 we first show that the forcing notion PC is equivalent to a more manageable partial order, which we denote by PFIN. From a PFIN- generic filter an infinite block sequence can be defined, from which, in turn, the generic filter can be reconstructed, roughly as a Mathias generic filter can be reconstructed from a Mathias real. In section 4. 1 we prove that PFIN is not equivalent to Matet forcing. This we do by showing that PFIN adds a dominating real, thus also a splitting real (see [4]). But Blass proved that Matet forcing preserves p-point ultrafilters in [2], from which follows that Matet forcing does not add splitting reals. Still in section 4. 1 we prove that PFIN adds a Mathias real by using Mathias characterization of a Mathias real in [7] according to which x ⊆ ω is a Mathias real over V iff x diagonalizes every maximal almost disjoint family in V. In fact, we prove that if D = (Di) i∈ω is the generic block sequence of finite sets of natural numbers added by forcing with PFIN, then both {minDi : i ∈ ω} and {maxDi : i ∈ ω} are Mathias reals. In section 4. 2 we prove that PFIN is equivalent to a two-step iteration of a σ-closed and a σ-centered forcing notions. In section 4. 3 we prove that PFIN satisfies Axiom A and in section 4. 4 that, as Mathias forcing, it has the pure decision property. In section 4. 5 we prove that PFIN does not add Cohen reals. So far, all the properties we have found of PFIN are also shared by Mathias forcing. The question remains, then, whether PFIN is equivalent to Mathias forcing. This we solve by first showing in section 5. 1 that PFIN adds a Matet real and then, in section 5. 2, that Mathias forcing does not add a Matet real, thus concluding that PFIN and Mathias forcing are not equivalent forcing notions. In the last, 5. 3, section we explore another forcing notion, denoted by M 2, which was introduced by Shelah in [9].

Aquesta tesi és una contribució a la teoria combinatria de conjunts, específcament a la teoria de Ramsey, que estudia les particions de conjunts infinits. El principi combinatori bàsic diu que per a tota partició del conjunt dels nombres naturals en un nombre finit de classes hi ha un conjunt infinit de nombres naturals que està inclòs en una de les classes. El teorema de Ramsey [6], que hom pot veure com una generalització d'aquest principi bàsic, tracta de les particions del conjunt [N]k de tots els subconjunts de k elements de nombres naturals. Afirma que, per a cada k >/= 1 i cada partició de [N]k en un nombre finit de classes, existeix un subconjunt infinit de nombres naturals, M, tal que tots els subconjunts de k elements de M pertanyen a una mateixa classe. Els conjunts amb aquesta propietat són homogenis per a la partició. En [3], Neil Hindman va demostrar un resultat de tipus Ramsey que Graham i Rotschild havien conjecturat en [2]. El teorema de Hindman afirma que si el conjunt de nombres naturals es divideix en dues classes, almenys una d'aquestes classes conté un conjunt infinit tal que totes les sumes finites d'elements distints del conjunt pertanyen a la mateixa classe. La demostració original del Teorema de Hindman va ser simplificada per James Baumgartner en [1]. En aquesta tesi <b>donem</b> noves demostracions d'aquests dos teoremes, basades en la tècnica del forcing. Després, analitzem els ordres parcials corresponents i n'estudiem les propietats i la relació amb altres ordres coneguts semblants. L'ordre parcial emprat en la demostració del teorema de Ramsey és equivalent al forcing de Mathias, definit en [5]. L'ordre parcial que apareix en la prova del teorema de Hindman, que anomenem PFIN, serà l'objecte d'estudi principal de la tesi. En el primer capítol <b>donem</b> algunes definicions bàsiques i enunciem alguns teoremes coneguts que necessitarem més endavant. El segon capítol conté la demostració del teorema de Ramsey. Usant la tècnica del forcing, produïm un conjunt homogeni per a una partició donada. L'ordre parcial que utilitzem és equivalent al de Mathias. En el tercer capítol, modifiquem la demostració de Baumgartner del teorema de Hindman per definir un ordre parcial, que anomenem PC, a partir del qual, mitjançant arguments de forcing, obtenim el conjunt homogeni buscat. Aquí, C es un conjunt infinit de conjunts finits disjunts de nombres naturals, i PC afegeix una successió de conjunts finits de nombres naturals amb la propietat de que totes les unions finites de elements d'aquesta successió pertanyen al conjunt C. A partir d'aquesta successió és fàcil obtenir un conjunt homogeni per a la partició del teorema original de Hindman. L'ordre parcial PC és similar a l'ordre definit per Pierre Matet en [4] i també al forcing de Mathias. Per això, és natural preguntar-nos si aquests ordres són equivalents o no. En el quart capítol treballem amb un ordre parcial que és equivalent a PC i que anomenem PFIN. Mostrem que PFIN té les propietats següents: (1) A partir d'un filtre genèric per a PFIN obtenim una successió infinita de conjunts finits de nombres naturals. Com en el cas del real de Mathias, aquesta successi_o ens permet reconstruir tot el filtre genèric. (2) PFIN afegeix un real de Mathias, que és un "dominating real". Ara bé, si afegim un "dominating real" afegim també un "splitting real". Aquest fet ens permet concloure que PFIN no és equivalent al forcing de Matet, ja que el forcing de Matet no afegeix "splitting reals" (3) PFIN es pot veure com una iteració de dos ordres parcials, el primer dels quals és "sigma-closed" i el segon és "sigma-centered". (4) PFIN té la "pure decision property". (5) PFIN no afegeix reals de Cohen. En el cinquè capítol demostrem que PFIN afegeix un real de Matet i, finalment, que el forcing de Mathias no afegeix reals de Matet. Això és com demostrem que el forcing de Mathias i PFIN no són ordres equivalents. Al final del capítol <b>donem</b> una aplicació de PFIN. Demostrem que un cert ordre definit per Saharon Shelah en [7], que anomenem M 2, és una projecció de PFIN. Això implica que si G és un filtre PFIN-genèric sobre V, l'extensió V [G] conté també un filtre genèric per a M 2. L'ordre M 2 és una mena de producte de dues cópies del forcing de Mathias.

40|$|Complex {{systems are}} {{abundant}} in our natural environment. In linear systems, the equations of their dynamics {{can be very}} difficult to solve, but if they cannot be described with a single characteristic scale, at least they can be described by a set of few characteristic scales that are totally decoupled from each other. However, this takes on a completely different flavour in non-linear systems, where scales are coupled and appropriate multiscale analysis is in order. This is the case of complex systems and, more particularly, scale invariant systems. In these, the approach to their solution is different, and it usually involves a multiscale basis. In this context, wavelets {{are one of the most}} used representation paradigms. The research context of complex systems and, particularly, scale invariant systems and multifractals has been in constant evolution over the last few years. Theoretical advances, either statistical (stochastic processes and probability distributions) or geometrical (function analysis and measure theory), along with fancy signal-processing algorithms suited to scale invariant data (and additionally handling aliasing, discretization and other artefacts of experimental data), have originated new tools for multifractal characterization of systems. While ten years ago the only methods available were statistical, by the start of this thesis project, development of geometrical methods had begun (most notably, the microcanonical multifractal formalism (MMF)). Geometrical methods have a clear advantage over statistical methods: they characterize each point of the system and thus they permit new applications such as reconstruction and prediction of signals, i. e., not only statistical characterization. Additionally, geometrical methods provide statistical characterization with much less need of data than statistical methods. In the present thesis, we have worked on the generalization and improvement of MMF, as well as its applications to the inference and forecasting of systems that follow a cascade process. In particular, we have described applications to two very different systems: stock-market series and ocean turbulence. The representation of the signal as a microcanonical cascade plays a crucial role in these applications. This representation can be achieved with one particular wavelet called optimal wavelet. The most relevant theoretical achievements are the regularization of diverging multifractal measures, the establishment of the bridge between multiplicative variables in microcanonical cascade processes and local singularity exponents, and the design of accurate and robust measure of wavelet optimality for a given dataset. To achieve this, we have introduced a new formalism, that of microcanonical cascades, that marries the cascade formalisms with MMF. Regarding the developed applications, on stock-market time series, we have inferred the distribution of future returns conditioned by the cascade and we have shown that a prediction based on this inference improves that of an ARIMA model. From the distribution of future returns, future volatility and value-at-risk can be reliably forecasted. On ocean data we have characterized dynamical aspects from optimal wavelet cascade analysis. In particular, we have observed that anomalies in the cascade of sea surface temperature show particular points of heat transfer between structures at different scales in the zones of wind-driven currents, also in the gyres. Both understanding [...] combined with appropriate modelling [...] of dynamics and design of inference/forecasting algorithms have crucial importance for the anticipation of changes in natural phenomena. In this context, the chain formed by the three steps followed during the thesis, namely multifractal characterization first, then obtaining of the optimal wavelet and finally design of inference algorithms, summarizes the direction we have followed to tackle the study of econometric time series and ocean maps. KEYWORDS: statistical physics, nonlinear dynamics, fractals, cascade processes Fenòmens naturals tant diversos com són la turbulència, les sèries economètriques i el camp magnètic heliocèntric tenen en comú el fet que són multifractals. La recent concepció de nous models que tenen en compte la presència de l'estructura multifractal estant permetent millorar la comprensió d'aquests fenòmens. D'igual manera, s'està explotant la capacitat d'aquests models en problemes com la codificació de dades amb mínim de redundància, la inferència de dades no disponibles i la previsió de l'evolució futura de la dinàmica del sistema. Malgrat aquests avenços, el disseny d'algorismes d'anàlisi multifractal de dades reals continua essent un repte important al qual fins ara s'ha donat resposta únicament de manera molt limitada. La presència de forats de dades, la discretització pròpia de les dades digitals, la presència de soroll i la de correlacions de llarg abast són dificultats comunes que necessiten ser tractades de forma curosa, mitjançant mètodes sofisticats, sobretot si es té en compte que les variables multifractals són intrínsecament irregulars a totes les escales i suavitzar-les implica modificar-ne les propietats. En aquesta tesi doctoral <b>donem</b> resposta als problemes esmentats per mitjà d'un formalisme multifractal basat en cascades multiplicatives microcanòniques. Mostrem que, si la base de representació de la cascada s'escull de forma adequada, les possibilitats d'inferència de la cascada milloren notablement i a més a més ho fan d'una forma robusta. En aquest sentit, mostrarem l'aplicació d'un model de cascada microcanònica per a la predicció de la distribució de cotització futura en sèries borsàries. Mostrarem també una altra aplicació d'un model de cascada microcanònica per a la detecció de transferències de calor entre escales a la superfície oceànica i com això permet identificar les zones de girs oceànics, les de ressorgiment d'aigües profundes i els corrents originats pels vents elisis. </i...|$|E
40|$|However {{successful}} classical {{general relativity}} is, it faces non-normalizability {{problems at the}} quantum mechanical level. Nevertheless, it predicts the existence of black holes, which are thermal objects {{that are expected to}} still exist in a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity. This {{is one of the main}} reasons why black holes are important. String theory is considered, today, to be the most successful candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. Its mathematical consistency requires spacetime to have ten dimensions, and thus, it motivates the study of general relativity, and in particular, black holes, in higher dimensions. This is the main focus of our thesis. Moreover, the advent of the AdS/CFT correspondence, relating a theory of gravity to a quantum field theory in one less dimension have raised even more the interest in higher dimensional gravity. Compared to four-dimensional general relativity, which has been largely studied and investigated in the past years, general relativity in higher dimensions has many interesting and new features. Uniqueness is one property of four dimensional general relativity that does not continue to hold in higher dimensions. Another related property is that in four dimensions black holes can have horizons of a spherical topology only, while in higher dimensions black objects can have other topologies as well. Black rings are a manifestation of this. The last two new properties lead to topological phase transitions in the phase space of higher dimensional black holes, which is one of the topics we consider and touch upon in this thesis. The existence of extended black objects in higher dimensions, called black “p”-branes, is an important and fundamental issue. Those objects were found to be dynamically unstable. Therefore, the following of this instability has become an important problem. What is the end state of it?. This instability is known as the Gregory-Laamme instability and it is another topic we investigate in our thesis and which we relate to a type of fluid-gravity correspondence in at spacetime. The existence of black “p”-branes is attributed to the fact that in higher dimensional general relativity there are black holes that can rotate as fast as one wishes. That is, there is no analogue of the four-dimensional Kerr bound which prevents black holes from spinning very fast. The fast rotation, on the other hand, which is possible in higher dimensions has the effect that it makes the horizon of the black hole flattens along the rotation plane, and hence, in the limit it approaches the black “p”-brane geometry. In chapter [3] we give a short introduction to the blackfolds approach to higher dimensional black holes. We discuss the reasons that make new approximate methods available in higher dimensions. We introduce the basic objects, or the building blocks, of the approach, which are the boosted black “p”-branes, and explain how the blackfolds approach can be used to construct from them new stationary solutions to the gravitational field equations with new and novel topologies and how it can be used to construct dynamical solutions as well. In chapter [4] we give a brief introduction to the topic of topology change in general relativity. We discuss the Kaluza-Klein black hole phases, the homogeneous black string phase, the inhomogeneous black string phase and the localized black hole phase. We explain the mechanism under which a topological phase transition appears as one moves in the phase space from a black string to a localized black hole. In chapter [5] we managed to formulate a type of fluid-gravity correspondence in at space. We found a map between a fluctuating boosed black “p”-brane and a relativistic viscous fluid living at spatial infinity. That is, we constructed a solution to the vacuum Einstein equations of a dynamical black “p”-brane up to first order in derivatives. The dual viscous fluid is characterized by two parameters (transport coefficients) in the stress tensor - the shear and bulk viscosities. Using the gravitational solution we succeeded to compute those coefficients. Furthermore, by using the effective description of the black “p”-brane as a viscous fluid in a lower number of dimensions we studied the Gregory-Laamme instability and we found a striking agreement with the numerical results, already obtained, on this problem (which were obtained by analyzing the linearized gravitational equations). In more details, by including the damping effect of the viscosity in the unstable sound waves, we obtained a remarkably good and simple approximation to the dispersion relation of the Gregory-Laamme modes, whose accuracy increases with the number of transverse dimensions. We proposed an exact limiting form as the number of dimensions tends to infinity. Hence, instead of attacking the complicated (linearized) gravitational equations we propose instead to attack the relativistic Navier-Stokes equations of the effective (dual) fluid, as they are much simpler than the former. In chapter [6] we tackled and made progress in a different problem - topology change in higher dimensional general relativity. Before the advent of our work there had been no analytical (but only numerical) complete example of a topological phase transition in general relativity. The black string / black hole phase transition in Kaluza-Klein spaces was analyzed and studied only numerically. Neverthelss, some local models had been obtained analytically. It was argued that the phase transition passes through (or is mediated by) a singular critical configuration; a self-similar double cone geometry. This geometry was found only locally, though. In our work we have provided for the first time a complete analytical example of a topological phase transition. We took the rotating black hole inside de-Sitter space (the Kerr-de-Sitter black hole), and we showed that if one follows a trajectory in the phase space of solutions along which the black hole rotation is increased then it will pancake along the rotation plane, and finally it will touch the de-Sitter horizon along that plane. A merger transition is obtained if one continues to move along the same phase space trajectory, leading to a merged phase with a single connected horizon. In our example, the critical configuration (in which the two horizons just meet) is mediated by a self-similar double cone, thus confirming previous propositions of the mechanism under which topological transitions work. We also described local models for the critical geometries that control many transitions in the phase space of higher-dimensional black holes, such as the pinch-down of a topologically spherical black hole to a black ring or to a black p-sphere, or the merger between black holes and black rings in black Saturns or di-rings in D >/= 6. It is worth mentioning, in addition, that the cones we have found are general ones (compared to previously known ones), in the sense that they describe two horizons that intersect each other at different temperatures, not only ones that intersect each other with the same temperature. However, in the case the two horizons intersect at different temperatures, there can be no merger transition afterwards, and so the trajectory of solutions in the phase space ends there. Malgrat el seu èxit a nivell clàssic, la relativitat general s'enfronta a problemes de no-renormalitzabilitat a nivell quàntic. No obstant, prediu l'existència de forats negres, que són objectes tèrmics que s'espera que continuïin existint en una teoria satisfactòria de gravetat quàntica. La seva consistència matemàtica requereix que l'espai-temps tingui deu dimensions, i d'aquesta manera motiva l'estudi de la relativitat general, i en particular els forats negres, en dimensions altes. Aquest és el tema central de la nostra tesi. A més, l'adveniment de la correspondència AdS/CFT, que relaciona una teoria de gravetat amb una teoria quàntica de camps en una dimensió menys, ha incrementat encara més l'interès en la gravetat en dimensions altes. Comparada amb la relativitat general en quatre dimensions, que ha estat àmpliament estudiada i investigada els darrers anys, la relativitat general en dimensions més altes té moltes característiques noves i interessants. La unicitat és una propietat de la relativitat general en quatre dimensions que no continua sent vàlida en dimensions més altes. Una altra propietat relacionada amb aquesta és que en quatre dimensions els forats negres només poden tenir horitzons amb topologia esfèrica, mentre que en dimensions més altes els objectes negres poden tenir també altres topologies. Els anells negres són una manifestació d'això. Les dues noves propietats esmentades donen lloc a transicions de fase topològiques a l'espai de fases dels forats negres en dimensions altes, que és un dels temes que considerem i als quals contribuïm en aquesta tesi. L'existència d'objectes negres estesos en dimensions altes, anomenats p-branes negres, és un tema important i fonamental. Se sap que aquests objectes són dinàmicament inestables. Per tant, la qüestió de cap on condueix aquesta inestabilitat ha esdevingut un problema important. Quin és l'estat final? Aquesta inestabilitat es coneix com la inestabilitat de Gregory-Laflamme i és un altre tema que investiguem a la nostra tesi, i que relacionem amb un tipus de correspondència entre fluids i gravetat a l'espai-temps pla. L'existència de p-branes negres s'atribueix al fet que en relativitat general en dimensions altes hi ha forats negres que poden rotar de manera arbitràriament ràpida. és a dir, no hi ha un anàleg de la cota de Kerr en quatre dimensions, que impedeix que els forats negres donin voltes molt de pressa. La rotació ràpida, per altra banda, que és possible en dimensions més altes té l'efecte d'aplanar l'horitzó del forat negre al llarg del pla de rotació, i per tant en el limit de velocitats altes s'apropa a la geometria de la p-brana negra. Al capítol 3 <b>donem</b> una breu introducció a l'estudi de forats negres en dimensions més altes per mitjà de les anomenades ``blackfolds''. Discutim les raons per les quals hom pot fer servir nous mètodes aproximats en dimensions més altes. Introduïm els objectes bàsics de l'enfoc amb blackfolds, les p-branes negres impulsades, i expliquem com l'enfoc amb blackfolds es pot fer servir per construir a partir d'elles noves solucions estacionàries de les equacions del camp gravitatori amb noves topologies, i com es pot fer servir també per construir solucions dinàmiques. Al capítol 4 <b>donem</b> una breu introducció al tema dels canvis de topologia en relativitat general. Discutim les fases del forat negre de Kaluza-Klein, la fase de corda negra homogènia, la fase de corda negra inhomogènia i fase de forat negre localitzat. Expliquem el mecanisme pel qual apareix una transició de fase topològica quan hom es mou per l'espai de fases des d'una corda negra fins a un forat negre localitzat. Al capítol 5 hem aconseguit formular un tipus de correspondència entre fluids i gravetat a l'espai pla. Hem trobat un mapa entre una p-brana negra impulsada fluctuant i un fluid viscós relativista situat a l'infinit espacial. és a dir, hem constrïit una solució de les equacions d'Einstein al buit d'una p-brana negra dinàmica fins a primer ordre en derivades. El fluid viscós dual està caracteritzat per dos paràmetres (coeficients de transport) al tensor d'energia-moment, la viscositat de cisallament i la viscositat de compressió. Fent servir la solució gravitatória hem pogut calcular aquests coeficients. A més, fent servir la descripció efectiva de la p-brana negra com un fluid viscós en un nombre més baix de dimensions hem estudiat la inestabilitat de Gregory-Laflamme, i els nostres resultats estan d'acord de manera molt precisa amb els resultats numèrics prèviament obtinguts en aquest problema (que havien estat obtinguts per mitjà d'una anàlisi de les equacions gravitaòóries linealitzades). Més en detall, incloent l'efecte d'amortiment de la viscositat en les ones de so inestables hem obtingut una aproximació remarcablement bona i senzilla a la relació de dispersió dels modes de Gregory-Laflamme, la precisió de la qual augmenta amb el nombre de dimensions transverses. Hem proposat una forma límit exacta quan el nombre de dimensions tendeix a infinit. Així, en lloc d'intentar resoldre les complicades equacions gravitatòries (linealitzades) proposem intentar resoldre les equacions relativistes de Navier-Stokes per al fluid efectiu (dual), ja que aquestes són molt més senzilles que les primeres. Al capítol 6 hem abordat i hem fet progrés en un altre problema: canvi de topologia en relativitat general en dimensions més altes. Abans del nostre treball no hi havia cap exemple analític complet (només n'hi havia de numèrics) d'una transició de fase topològica en relativitat general. La transició de fase corda negra/ forat negre en espais de Kaluza-Klein havia estat analitzada i estudiada només numèricament. No obstant, alguns models local...|$|E

Yüzyıl’a özgü teknolojik, ekonomik ve toplumsal dönüşümler dolayısıyla kültür(hars/ekin) ve de mimarlık alanında da daha önceki yüzyıllarda görünmemiş bir devinim ve çokseslilik görünmektedir. Bu etkenlerle birlikte, Soğuk Savaş ve sonrası siyasi iklimi de, yeri geldiğinde ticari ve sanat sergileri ile birlikte sinema gibi araçlarla da yapılan yaymacaların dışında,  toplum ruhbilimi açısından da bakıldığında, kaçınılmaz olarak mimarlık alanında yansımalarını bulmuştur.   Bu çalışmada kazıbilim alanında dönemini yansıtmakta oldukça önemli bir buluntu işlevi gören mimarlığın, geleneksel sınıflandırmaları dışında, 20. Yüzyılla birlikte, o yüzyıla özgü ortaya çıkan yaygın ekini yansıtma işlevini de yerine getirmeye başlamış olan yapısı da gözönüne alınmıştır. Döneminin gelecek algısı ve düşlemini de yansıtarak aslında biraz da bu tasavvurlardan oluşan çağının ruhunu da beyazperdeye yansıttığı görünen 20. Yüzyıl kazıbilim buluntularından olan sinemanın da <b>dönem</b> mimarlığının anlaşılabilmesinde oldukça yararlı olduğu düşünülmüştür. Böylelikle, bu çalışmada sürekliliğinden ve her <b>dönem</b> ‘çağdaş’ kalabilmesinden ötürü sözkonusu etmenler ışığında ve etkisinde yazılmış olan anlatılarının biçimlendirmiş olduğu James Bond film mekânları, dönemlerinin isimsiz mimarlıklarına da ışık tutabilecek birer kazıbilim buluntusu gibi ele alınmıştır.   Soğuk Savaş ve sonrası dünyası toplumlarında bireylerin düşlem ve gerçeklerden kaçış dünyalarını oluşturmalarına karşın, hâlihazırda kendisi de geleneksel sınıflandırmalara giren uygulamalara görece daha az ele alınmış olan popüler mimarlığın ticari alandaki uygulamalarından da görece az olan birey ve kimlik alanındaki çalışmalara da bir ek olabilecek bu çalışma ile bir katkı sağlanabilmesi hedeflenmektedir. Böyleece mimarî biçemlerin popüler kültürdeki yansımaları ile birlikte, bir meslek dalı olarak mimarlığın kendi tarihindeki bu çağa özgü dönüşümlerine de işaret edilebilmiş olduğu da düşünülebilecektir. Since 1950 s, a {{dynamism}} and a polyphony {{which were}} not seen in the previous centuries either in the culture or in the architecture areas could be observed thanks to technological, economical, and social transformations peculiar to the 20 th century. Along with these factors, political climate belonging to the Cold War era and its aftermath have been reflected in the architecture not only through propaganda made by cultural means of world fairs, art exhibitions, and the cinema but also through the subconscious of the individual. Apart from traditional classifications of architecture, due to its function as an important artefact that reflects the zeitgeist of an era in archaeology, architecture’s another function, which started in the 20 th century, that reflects the popular culture unique to the given century, has been {{taken into account in}} this study. It has been thought that, the cinema, {{which is one of the}} 20 th century’s artefacts of the archaeology, by letting this unique era to be understood much better by reflecting its perception of the future and imagination - the concepts that partly forms its age’s spirit - may also be helpful in illuminating those parts of the 20 th century architecture that were kept in the background. Thus, James Bonds movie locations which have been shaped by the narrative that has been written under the light and influence of the factors mentioned above have been treated as archaeological artefacts that could shed light on the no name/anonymous architecture of their era because of their sustainability and being always ‘new’ and contemporary at every age. Despite the fact that the individuals during the Cold War and its aftermath created their own phantasmagorical worlds of escape from harsh realities and anxieties, because the 20 th century and consequently the individual in this century is a relatively new field of study in the history of architecture, in this study, it is also aimed to make a contribution as an addition to these relatively new studies covering the identity, the individual and the architecture issues. Moreover, it can be thought that along with reflections of architectural trends and styles on the popular culture, transformations of the architecture in its history as a profession peculiar to this age might be indicated. Therefore, in order to reveal the infrastructures, on top of which the architectural styles, and consequently the Bond Worlds/Universes, peculiar to their era have risen, from the second half of the 20 th century till today, first of all, three concomitant factors, namely, changing political climates, technological advancements and the transformations in the economic system, were examined in Chapter 2. As mentioned above in the context of the Cold War, while always being a tool, reflecting identity and power, also revealing the concept and the perception of a future awaiting a particular society, the foundations of architecture, like those of ideologies, are always based in the future. This future is expressed always in the ‘present progressive tense’. Secondly, technology, the creator of the age of ideologies in the 19 th century, and which is shaping our brave new world is also one of the main forces shaping the ‘futuristic’ Bondian architecture. While dealing with political, technological and economical determinants, also the trends and transformations in the field of popular psychology was to be dealt with, since this branch of science is not only definitive, but also, sometimes a determinant factor when it comes to the subject of understanding the society at a particular era, as to be seen in Chapter 2. Besides being a useful tool, when one is to describe an era, this field also is to shape the way we see ourselves. The other main determinant to be examined in the second chapter is the cybernetics. Systemics, replacing sciences, day by day is also thanks to the developments in the field of cybernetics, which has been shaping the Bondian architecture, since its beginning.   As to the architectural transformations from the 1950 s to present, regarding the perception and the representation of those transformations in the popular culture, first a literature review, where the mainstream architectural styles in conjunction with their reflections and embodiments in the popular culture was conducted. Those findings are supported again with examples, mainly selected from the popular cultural spaces/places/locations in Chapter 3. In both chapters, apart from the historical and theoretical literature sources from architecture and other disciplines, the mainstream press sources like Time-Life and The Economist magazines’ and also a popular culture lifestyle magazine, with which both James Bond and his creator Ian Fleming has a special relationship, namely Playboy’s archives were searched. This was done because, while the other literature review subjects in this study, such as, the word politics shares the same etymological roots with the word polis (city) and the word economy (oikonomia) figuratively means ‘household management’, also the word magazine stems from Arabic word, makhzan, which means ‘a place for storing goods, especially military ammunition’. The word magazine’s meaning as we know it today dates from the publication of the first one, namely, “Gentleman’s Magazine” (1731) and the word ‘interior’ stands for its spatial meaning as a design discipline since 1807 (interior decoration). Therefore, besides the ‘special relationship’ between them, seeing the Bondian villain’s Disneyland-like bachelor pad or ‘penthouse’ like grottoes and futuristic spaceship-like interiors, a strong connection between the worlds of Bond and Playboy magazine, a lifestyle magazine, where, not only ‘the girls next door’ are represented in contemporary design interiors, but also the covers and pages can be experienced like the way imaginary interiors experienced, has been established. Furthermore, a utopian global tourist figure Bond, being a modern version St. George, fighting the dragon in mythology-like structured narratives, also goes to Disneyland-like ‘bachelor’s pad’ and ‘man cave’ grottos of the antagonists, who can be taken as anti-establishment figures. Due to similar reasons, this study also covered utopian unbuilt architectural projects like those of Archigram, which, despite being solely published, affected the architectural world immensely. Also, once-counterculture resources, like the Whole Earth Catalogue, where, from new age life style products, to psycho-cybernetics to computer DIY, and from Drop City and Archigram to Buckminster Fuller’s Dymaxion World and World Game and from yurts and David Thoreau’s Walden to utopic projects like Arcosanti, were catalogued was part of this popular culture media and cinema archaeological research ‘site’.   As the ancient architectural relics and artefacts are to be fully comprehended only if the techne and poiesis and the socio-cultural base of the given civilisation is known, a superhero of the popular culture mythologies, James Bond, consequently Bondian architecture is a product of the superstructure of his age. After delving into the technological, political and socio-cultural ‘landslides’ of the ‘base’ in Chapter 1 and the inseparable transformations in the architectural ‘superstructure’ in Chapter 2, being of one mind with Walter Benjamin, to whom, neither the train station, nor the factory, but with their proto-cinematic phantasmagorical and surreal dream worlds, the arcade, a mass-consumption ‘machine’, was the most important building type and representation of its age, and in a Deleuzeian-Guattarian fashion, also seeing that ‘desiring-production’ has become the main productive force in our society, Bondian architecture was analysed in Chapter 4, in the light of all the those findings. Hence, it is thought that apart from merely being a product and representation of its ‘base’, figuratively and structurally cinematographic Bondian architecture may also be helpful in revealing the ‘real life’ veil of its age, as in the psychoanalysis of dreams.   In the Evaluation and Conclusions, in the light of a ‘consilience’ of inductions made from those separate findings derived from the previous chapters, a bigger picture, framing both the reflections and refractions of the architectural transformations since 1950 s on the glossy surface of celluloid world of a ‘blunt instrument’ and a flaneur of exotic spaces, James Bond was described. In order to do that, a table, consisting of the architectural styles deployed in Bond films and the (English) Establishment and counter-establishment Bond characters were also used to illustrate those transformations. As to the findings, regarding the Establishment representations, it is seen that, the Establishment spaces, which had been in the Revivalist style, since the beginning of the series, underwent a radical transformation, due to the rise of ‘corporate culture’ and after the fall of the old order of the Cold War world. In its real life Postmodern location, alongside with and the cybernetic office principles, having gone through a ‘de-identification’ procedure, it became a Rationalist corporate space in a new world where, instead of traditional class divisions, cybernetic principles rule the business. Yet, in the last Bond movie, in a correlative relationship with the anti-establishment space, a revival of Revivalist M Space is witnessed. Apropos of the anti-establishment space, namely, the villain’s lair, it seems to be possible to talk about a gradual dematerialisation of this space, especially after the 1979 Bond movie Moonraker, which can be taken as the zenith of the futuristic and utopian Bond movies, and also the last movie, the production designer of which was the legendary Sir Ken Adam, an architect. His Expressionist style, with an added larger-than-life ‘theatrical realness’ value, reflecting not only the bachelor’s Disneyland-like phantasmagorical ‘man-cave’ utopias, but also the anxieties of Cold War, made the villain’s lair the main antagonist in the Bond’s mythological world. After that, while ‘Systemics’ replacing science, ‘super-Rationality’ of cybernetics replacing Rationalism, negative liberty replacing positive liberty, the global concepts replacing those of the universal, the image of the Merkwelt of Supermodernism replacing vision and while ‘Freud is Dead’, Brutalism and Revivalism gain weight gradually in this ‘other’s place, replacing Expressionism and Surrealism, while the mythological ‘other space’ is almost completely lost due to the reasons mentioned above. It is seen that, not only the grotto interior of the villain in his uniform, but also the architecture itself is almost dematerialised whereas ‘non-place’, ‘third space’ of the mass society at ‘home’ and at the relatively ‘other’s space took command in the commander Bonds’ narratives. As seen in the last Bond movie Skyfall, where a ready made ‘battle island’ took the place of the old haute couture Bondian villain architecture, and the modern St. George, Bond demolished his Father’s cottage house in a ‘Picturesque’ setting, both the autre protagonist and architect’s places are also replaced by the sublime of a new, man-made ‘Romantic’, Revivalist and Weltlandschaft/World Landscape in the end.

Bu projenin Odayeri-Paşaköy bölümünde yaklaşık 115 km uzunluğa sahip Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu yer almaktadır. Karayolu güzergahının amacı mevcut olan trafiği azaltmak ve ulaşım problemini giderebilmektir.   Bu tez kapsamında Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Garipçe yarmasının mühendislik jeolojisi ve kazı şevlerinin analizi değerlendirilmiştir. Garipçe yarmasının bulunduğu zemin ve kaya birimlerinin mühendislik jeolojisi özellikleri incelenmiştir. Inceleme alanının veri tabanlarının olşturulması amacıyla 9 adet mekanik sondaj, sismik çalışmalar  ile saha çalışmaları ve laboratuvar deneyleri yapılmıştır.  Sondajlar ile korele edilen jeofizik çalışmalar ışığında inceleme alanının jeolojisi yorumlanmıştır. Mühendislik jeolojisi çalışmaları sonucu şev duraylılığı açısından meydana gelebilecek sorunlar üzerinde durulmuştur.   Kinematik analiz çalışmaları ile andezit birimlerinin düzlemsel kayma, kama kayması ve devrilme durumları sağ ve sol şevler için ayrı ayrı incelenmiştir. Yarma içerisinde kritik olarak belirlenen kesitlerde zemin ve kaya birimleri için hesaplanmış olan parametreler ile Plaxis programı yardımıyla stabilite analiz çalışmaları yapılmıştır. Analizler statik ve dinamik (depremli) durum için ayrı ayrı incelenmiştir. Kesit üzerinde en büyük kayma çemberi çizdirilerek kritik olan bölge belirlenmiş ve o noktalardaki güvenlik sayıları elde edilmiştir. Yarmalarda uzun dönemde duraylılığı sağlayacak koşullar göz önüne alınmıştır. Araştırma Mühendislik Hizmetleri Teknik Şartnamesine göre uzun <b>dönem</b> (statik) için güvenlik sayısı 1. 5 ’den büyük, uzun <b>dönem</b> (dinamik) için güvenlik sayısı ise 1. 1 ’dem büyük olmalıdır. Bu değerlere uygun olmayan güvenlik sayıları değerleri ile karşılaşıldığında iyileştirme yollarına başvurulmuştur.   Garipçe yarması için belirlenen şev oranları 1. palyeden önce 2 Y/ 3 D, 1. palye ile 2. palye arası 3 Y/ 2 D, 2 palyeden sonra 2 Y/ 1 D olarak belirlenmiştir. Km: 86 + 330 kesitinde yapılan stabilite analiz çalışması sonucunda statik ve dinamik durumlarda yarmanın güvenlik sayısının uygun değere sahip olmadığı tespit edilmiştir. Zemin çivisi ve püskürtme beton ile iyileştirme yapılan yarmanın statik durumda 1. 74, dinamik durumda 1. 37 değerleri elde edilmiş ve güvenli olduğu belirlenmiştir.   Km: 86 + 590 kesitinde yapılan stabilite analiz sonucunda statik ve dinamik durumlardaki güvenlik sayıları açısından herhangi bir problemin olmadığı görülmektedir.

Works {{regarding}} highway {{course to}} be carried out within the scope of the North Marmara Highway comprise of Poyraz-Paşaköy motorway and Çamlık-Reşadiye access road in the Asian side and Odayeri-Garipçe motorway and İstoç-Odayeri access road in the European side. North Marmara Highway having approximately 115 km length takes place in the Odayeri-Paşaköy section of this project. Objective of such highway route is to ensure passing the strait of İstanbul within the shortest time in a comfortable way as well as to mitigate the traffic load of hazardous pollutants on the urban roads and existing suspension bridges over Bosphorus, {{and as a result of}} this, ensure fuel savings, and reduce the effects of contaminated air resulting from the transportation inside the city. Transportation system on rails will also benefit from the suspension bridge planned to be constructed over the strait with high standard for passing Bosphorus. Engineering geology and excavation slopes analysis of road cuts in Garipçe of the North Marmara Highway have been evaluated within the scope of this thesis. Studies related to the engineering geology in order to determine engineering properties, state of underground water and the rock quality of the environment with regard to Garipçe earth work place in the project scope, have been evaluated within the scope of this thesis. In the area where the road cutting is taken place, it changes into totally decomposed, extremely decomposed andesite and levels of agglomerate andesite locally available comprising the Garipçe formation when going down to lower layers, whilst Meşetepe formation is taken place at the upper part. It caused subsurface water to be present in the Andesite-volcanic tuff bodies, and locally formed small spring waters unearthing such subsurface water. Although these bodies usually seem to be stable in the nature, they may also exhibit other behaviors than stable state when they are subjected to engineering processes. Geological map-cross section with 1 / 1000 scale and geotechnical data table of the Garipçe earth work covering the area under examination have been prepared. Cross-sectional studies have been carried out at the certain kilometers specified as critical. General geology and hydrogeology of the route have been outlined within the scope of the report, engineering geology properties of the formations have been described, drilling and geophysical studies have been carried out in the field and laboratory experiments have been evaluated. Laboratory experiments have been performed on the soil and rock using analyses to determine the stability of slopes that will be built up during the construction of Garipçe earth work within the area under examination, and samples taken for the purposes of determining index properties of the material in order to evaluate the geomechanical behaviors of the material in this area. Data related to consistency limits, sieve analysis and water content have been determined with the experiments on samples taken from the soil. On the samples obtained from the rocks experiments such as physical properties, mechanical properties, erosion index in water and triaxial pressure test have been performed. In addition to that geophysical (MASW) studies were carried out in order to determine the border between soil and rock in detail. Geological state of the area under examination have been interpreted in the light of drillings and correlated geophysical studies. Emphasis has been put on the problems that may arise in terms of slope stability and be identified as a result of engineering study. Positions of their joints were determined from the andesite exposure constituting the rock bodies through which road cut slopes are formed. Contour diagrams and kinematic analysis have been carried out with such mesurements taken by using the Dips software program of the RocScience company. With the aid of kinematic analysis studies, planar sliding, wedge sliding and toppling situations of the andesite bodies have been examined for right and left  slopes separately. Determination of the slope ratios capable of keeping their stability under the conditions in the long run, has been intended in the road cutting known as Garipçe earth work, exhibiting a feature of through road cut, having a length of 800 meters and a height of 40 meters. In this regard, drilling operations and geophysical measurement (MASW) works have been carried out together with the  studies on surface geology in the field, and laboratory tests with regard to soil and rock mechanics have been performed on the samples taken. All of these data have been evaluated in the office environment and stability analysis works have been carried out along with the engineering parameter calculations. Hoek-Brown Criterion Generalized by Hoek et al. (2002) has been proposed in order to estimate the strength of rock mass from the properties of rock material with the most correct approach. In this respect, a software known as RocLab which is based on Hoek-Brown failure criterion and determines the strength parameters of a rock mass, has been employed for the rock classification in the cross sections specified as critical within the road cut.   Strength parameter calculation related to the soil bodies has been carried out with the empirical calculations at all distances between axis for the clay bodies where pile foundation are located, taking the results obtained from the laboratory experiments into consideration. Soil parameter calculations include cohesion without drainage (cu) and modulus of elasticity (Es) calculations. Soil parameter calculations include such short term parameter calculations as cohesion without drainage (cu) and modulus of elasticity (Es) and such long term parameter calculations as angle of internal friction (ϕ) and drained elastic modulus (Es). Rock quality classifications for Garipçe earth work have been achieved using RQD and RMR methods. Stability analysis works have been carried out using Plaxis 2 D software with the parameters calculated for the soil and rock bodies in the cross-sections specified as critical inside the road cut. Plaxis 2 D software is a finite element package specially developed for two dimensional analysis of deformation and stability in the geotechnical projects. Analysis have been carried out for static and dynamic (with earthquake) cases separately. Effective ground acceleration coefficient is A 0 = 0, 2 g since location of road cut in Garipçe under examination falls into the third grade earthquake region according to the seismic hazard map. Critical region was determined drawing the greatest slip circle on the cross-section, and factors of safety at those points were obtained. Long term stability which is the most critical case, must be evaluated using effective sliding resistance parameters when stability of the excavation slopes are of concern. According to the technical specification for surveying engineering services, safety factor for long term (static) must be greater than 1. 5 and for long term (dynamic) must be greater than 1. 1. Safety factors have been improved using certain ways in case where factors of safety nonconforming to these values were observed. It was observed that no stability problem will be expected in case of specified slope ratios such as 2 Y/ 3 D before the 1 st bench, 3 Y/ 2 D between 1 st bench and 2 nd bench and 2 Y/ 1 D after 2 nd bench for the road cut in Garipçe. At the end of the studies, Km: 86 + 330 and Km: 86 + 590 cross sections have been considered to be critical and stability analyses have been carried out. In these cross sections at the 42 meter deep from the land level located are a soil body where andesite was completely decomposed and became soil, together with an andesite body featuring main rock properties with agglomerate interface underneath, and decomposed sections of that body. Parameter calculations have been carried out for sandy elastic silt, slightly sandy low-plastic silt and andesite bodies observed for this section. It was determined that it has a "very weak rock" quality taking the correlation between the RQD defined by Deere (1968) and engineering quality of the rock into consideration. It was determined that the factors of safety under both static and dynamic conditions did not have a proper value at the end of the analysis works performed on the Km: 86 + 330 cross section. Such factors of safety as 1. 31 for the static situation and 1. 11 for the dynamic situation have been obtained in the stability analysis study. At this section where there is a expropriation problem, it was recommended that the slope before the 1 st bench must be reinforced with  28 mm (diameter), 10 meter long soil nails with 2 mx 3 m (Y/D) pattern and 20 cm thick shot concrete. Following values, such as 1. 74 for static conditions and 1. 37 for dynamic conditions, have been obtained for the road cut reinforced and improved with the soil nails and shot concrete and it was deemed to be reliable. It is seen that there is no problem in terms of static and dynamic safety factors observed at the end of of stability analysis works carried out in the Km: 86 + 590 cross section. Parameter calculations have been carried out for elastic silt, sandy clay, decomposed andesite and andesite bodies observed for this section. It was determined that it has a "very weak rock" quality taking the correlation between the RQD defined for andesite and decomposed andesite by Deere (1968) and engineering quality of the rock into consideration. Such factors of safety as 2. 30 under static conditions and 1. 77 under dynamic conditions have been calculated in the stability analysis study and it was seen that there is no problem with the stability of road cut. Slope before the 1 st bench between Km: 86 + 570 – 86 + 650 in the section where Km: 86 + 590 is located, was observed to be reliable. However, in terms of road cut safety in the long run it will be proper to apply the reinforcing system given at the table above to this gap where decomposed andesite body will be interrupted.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Farklı ekosistemlerin karbon bütçelerini belirlemek küresel karbon döngüsünü anlayabilmek açısından oldukça önemli bir konudur. Özellikle küresel ısınmanın en büyük sebebinin insan kaynaklı sera gazlarının (karbondioksit ve metan başta olmak üzere) atmosferik konsantrasyonlarının artışı olduğu düşünülünce, bu konuda yapılan bilimsel araştırmaların artış göstermesi yadsınamaz. FLUXNET (Akı Ağı) projesi kapsamında dünya üzerindeki farklı ekosistemlerin karbon bütçesini belirleyebilmek için altı kıtada karbondioksit akıları ölçülmektedir. Akı Ağında ölçüm alanları başta ormanlar olmak üzere, tarım alanları ve çayırlardır. Türkiye ise, bu akı ağı projesine hala dahil değildir. FAO’ya göre Avrupa’nın 1 / 3 ’ünü tarım alanları oluşturmaktadır. Bu sebeple toplam karbon döngüsündeki etkileri küçük de olsa tarım alanları üzerinde yapılan ölçümler, farklı tarım ürünleri ekilmesinin ve farklı tarımsal faaliyetler yürütülmesinin karbon bütçesi üzerindeki etkilerini belirleyebilmek için oldukça gereklidir. Bu ölçümlerin uzun dönemler devam ettirilmesi elde edilecek sonuçların güvenilirliği açısından oldukça önemli bir husustur. Bu çalışmada, Kırklareli’nde bulunan Atatürk Toprak Su ve Tarımsal Meteoroloji Araştırma İstasyonu Müdürlüğü’ne ait deneme alanında eddy kovaryans ölçüm sistemi kurularak 2009 - 2010 ve 2010 - 2011 gelişme dönemleri için buğday bitkisinin karbondioksit akıları ölçülmüştür. Ölçülen verilere frekans tepki düzeltmeleri, Webb-Pearman-Leuning düzeltmesi ve koordinat düzeltmesi yapılmıştır. Yapılan düzeltmelerden sonra elde edilen verilerden yağış, rüzgar yönü, yetersiz türbülans sebebiyle hatalı kabul edilen veriler atılmış ve eksik veriler uluslararası çalışmalarda kabul görmüş tamamlama yöntemleriyle doldurulmuştur. Bu ölçüm sonuçlarından bitkinin ne kadar karbonu atmosferden aldığını ve ne kadarını atmosfere tekrar geri verdiğini gösteren NEE (Net Ekosistem Değişimi), GPP (Brüt Fotosentez) ve Reco (Ekosistem Solunumu) değerleri hesaplanmıştır. Yapılan çalışma sonucunda kışlık buğdayın toplam NEE, GPP ve Reco değerleri 2009 - 2010 gelişme döneminde sırasıyla - 354. 9, 1142. 2 ve 788. 6 g C m- 2 olarak bulunmuştur. Bu <b>dönem</b> için ortalama günlük GPP 4. 21 g C m- 2, Reco 2. 91 g C m- 2 ve NEE - 1. 31 g C m- 2 olmuştur. 2010 - 2011 gelişme döneminde toplam NEE, GPP ve Reco değerleri sırasıyla - 441. 3 g C m- 2, 1046. 8 g C m- 2 ve 605. 5 g C m- 2 olmuştur. Bu <b>dönem</b> için ortalama günlük NEE, GPP ve Reco değerleri ise sırasıyla - 1. 72 g C m- 2, 4. 09 g C m- 2 ve 2. 37 g C m- 2 ’dir. Bu çalışmada ayrıca karbon akıları ile meteorolojik faktörler ve yine karbon akıları ile vejetasyon dinamikleri (NDVI, LAI, sPRI, biyokütle) arasında ilişki olup olmadığı incelenmiştir. Karbon akıları ile meteorolojik faktörler arasındaki ilişkiler incelendiğinde, özellikle bitkinin fotosentez aktivitesinin arttığı zaman aralığında PPFD ile GPP arasında doğrusal olmayan iyi bir ilişki olduğu görülmektedir. Reco daha çok toprak sıcaklığıyla bağlantılı çıkmıştır. Ayrıca vejetasyon dinamikleri ile karbon akıları arasında da oldukça yüksek belirlilik katsayısına sahip ilişkiler tespit edilmiştir. One of {{the most}} {{important}} research subjects of agricultural meteorology is evaluating the possible effects of agriculture on climate change. Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, especially anthropogenic carbon dioxide, is seen as the most significant reason of global warming. Therefore, determination of the carbon dioxide released to and captured from the atmosphere within the components of global carbon cycle is still being searched by scientists. Terrestrial ecosystems are among the most important components of global carbon cycle on earth because they capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release it to the atmosphere again. Hence, evaluation of the effect of plants in these terrestrial ecosystems on the carbon cycle must be done carefully. Additionally, searching the agricultural activities that affect the amount of captured and released carbon (dioxide) is a scientifically supported issue and long-term flux measurements of different ecosystems are required {{to be able to do}} all related researches. For this reason, flux networks are established to measure carbon dioxide, water vapor and energy fluxes between different terrestrial ecosystems (forests, croplands, grasslands, peat lands etc.) and the atmosphere across five continents. Most of the micrometeorological systems are installed first in forests then in croplands. The amount of micrometeorological tower sites is increasing in order to measure mass and energy fluxes above canopies. In Turkey, there are limited studies about these issues. To fulfill this lack,, changes in carbon dioxide fluxes during the two growing periods of winter wheat were measured and determined in the Thrace Region using a micrometeorological method called Eddy Covariance for the first time in Turkey in the frame of the TÜBİTAK project named “Determination of Carbon Dioxide, Water Vapor and Energy Fluxes for Winter Wheat”. The research field was located at Atatürk Soil Water and Agricultural Meteorology Research Station, Kırklareli. An eddy covariance measurement system that consists of a 3 -dimensional sonic anemometer, open path infrared CO 2 /H 2 O gas analyzer, temperature, humidity sensors and data logger was used to calculate fluxes. Additionally, an agrometeorological station measuring air temperature, soil temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction (at different heights), precipitation, global radiation and photosynthetically active radiation etc. was installed in the research field. Furthermore, spectral measurements have been done periodically. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and scaled photochemical reflectance index (sPRI) have also been calculated from spectral measurements. Additional Leaf area index (LAI) measurements have been done once in a two-week period. General principle of eddy covariance measurements is the covariance between concentration of interest and vertical wind speed in eddies. Eddy covariance is a widely used micrometeorological method to calculate turbulent fluxes within the atmospheric boundary layer. Complexity of the method, high cost of the system, correction issues etc. are some disadvantages of this technique. Moreover; experimental knowledge, micrometeorological and agrometeorological background are needed to apply the method correctly. Being a direct measuring method and having no need to empirical constants are the main advantages of this method. In this study; frequency response corrections, WPL (Webb, Pearman, Leuning) correction and coordinate rotation (tilt correction) have been applied to 10 Hz time series of eddy covariance data after de-spiking. Heavy precipitation and low turbulent exchange conditions affect the eddy covariance measurements so that the system produces bad data. Hence, the data gaps caused by the above conditions must be filled. Here, international standard procedures have been followed. Finally, flux partitioning was done and the net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) values were calculated during 2009 - 2010 and 2010 - 2011 growth period of winter wheat. NEE is positive (+) when carbon dioxide flux is from winter wheat ecosystem to atmosphere and negative when carbon dioxide flux is from atmosphere to winter wheat ecosystem. In the 2009 - 2010 growth period, winter wheat was planted on 9 October 2009 and harvested on 6 July 2010. The eddy covariance flux measurements showed that cumulative NEE, GPP and Reco were - 354. 9, 1142. 2 and 788. 6 g C m- 2 respectively for the whole growing period. Daily means of NEE, GPP and Reco for the whole growth period are - 1. 31, 4. 21 and 2. 91 g C m- 2, succesively. During the 2010 - 2011 growth period, the crop was sown on 25 October 2010 and harvested on 8 July 2011. For this growth period, cumulative NEE, GPP and Reco have been determined as - 441. 3, 1046. 8 and 605. 5 g C m- 2, respectively. Similarly, succesive daily means of NEE, GPP and Reco for 2010 - 2011 of winter wheat were obtained as - 1. 72, 4. 09 and 2. 37 g C m- 2. A further step was taken by the analysis of possible relationships between winter wheat NEE, GPP and Reco and some meteorological factors such as air temperature, soil temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PPFD). These relationships were examined by taking different winter wheat growing seasons into account. The first period was between sowing and tillering, the second period was between tillering and bolting, whereas the third period was between bolting and flowering and finally the fourth one was between flowering and harvest. In 2009 - 2010 growth period, the highest value of the determination coefficient (r 2 = 0. 7) between GPP and air temperature has been determined for the third period. Determination coefficient between GPP and soil temperature for the third period was also 0. 7. In the other three periods, GPP was less or even not related to air or soil temperature. There were nonlinear relationships between GPP and PPFD during the first (r 2 = 0. 72) and the third periods (r 2 = 0. 6). For the second and the last periods, no significant relationship could be obtained. The results have shown that NEE was not related to air and soil temperature at all. The relationship between NEE and PPFD was the best (r 2 = 0. 82) during the first period. There were strong nonlinear correlations (determination of coefficients are between 0. 89 and 0. 99) between Reco and both air and soil temperatures during the first and the third periods. Similar relationships between carbon fluxes and meteorological factors have also been determined for the 2010 - 2011 winter wheat growth period. However, the relationships are not appreciable when compared with these during the previous growth period. Another goal of this study was to evaluate the possible interactions between cumulative carbon fluxes and vegetation indices (NDVI, sPRI, LAI and biomass). To achieve this, the relationships between cumulative NEE, GPP, Reco and NDVI have been determined for the whole 2009 - 2010 growth period. Determination coefficients were 0. 86 for NEE and Reco and 0. 95 for GPP. Same relationships have been investigated for two separated periods in case of the 2010 - 2011 growth season. The first period was the one during which NDVI is continuously rising whereas NDVI was continuously decreasing in the second period. There were strong nonlinear relationships between cumulative carbon fluxes (NEE, GPP and Reco) and NDVI. The determination coefficients between cumulative GPP and NDVI were 0. 74 when NDVI was continuously rising and 0. 91 when NDVI was continuously decreasing. r 2 values for the correlation between cumulative NEE and NDVI were 0. 7 while NDVI was continuously rising and 0. 99 while NDVI was continuously decreasing. Strong nonlinear relationships have also been found (r 2 values are 0. 79 while NDVI was rising and 0. 997 while NDVI was decreasing) between cumulative Reco and NDVI. Furthermore, it has been found that cumulative carbon fluxes were strongly correlated with LAI both for 2009 - 2010 and 2010 - 2011 growing seasons. During the 2009 - 2010 growth season, the coefficients of determination (r 2) between cumulative GPP, NEE, Reco and LAI were 0. 97 for the period in which the LAI values were continuously rising (0 <LAI< 3. 7). The determination coefficients between carbon fluxes and LAI varied from 0. 0. 87 to 0. 98 while LAI values were decreasing. In addition, strong linear correlations have also been specified between all cumulative carbon fluxes and LAI values in 2010 - 2011 growth season. Associations between cumulative carbon fluxes and biomass values have been investigated for the whole growth period. In this context, determination coefficients between cumulative NEE, GPP, Reco and biomass were obtained as 0. 97, 0. 99 and 0. 97, for the 2009 - 2010 growth period, respectively. Also in 2010 - 2011 growth period, strong relationships (0. 93 < r 2 < 0. 97) between cumulative carbon fluxes and biomass values have been determined. The relationships between carbon exchange parameters and sPRI were evaluated by using all the data within the growing period. Consequently, good nonlinear relationships (0. 86 &# 8804; r 2 &# 8804; 0. 87) have been obtained between these parameters. For the whole growth period, a good nonlinear relationship (r 2 = 0. 87) has been obtained between cumulative GPP and sPRI. Consequently, the results of this study showed that carbon exchange parameters of winter wheat plant are affected by many meteorological and environmental factors. Clarification of the effects of these factors by making related studies would enable the researchers to define, explain and model the carbon exchange of winter wheat. Onthe other hand, evaluation of long term eddy covariance measurements is necessary for the reliability of the model results. After that, carbon budget of winter wheat can be estimated for wide areas. In addition to these, it is a clear need to measure and observe fluxes, meteorological factors, vegetation dynamics such as NDVI, sPRI, LAI, biomass for different plant varieties. Modeling by associating the carbon flux measurements with meteorological factors and vegetation dynamics gives the opportunity to use the results for wider areas. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

One of {{the main}} subjects which is tried {{to be gained by}} the students in industrial design education is the material knowledge. Material knowledge is the part of basic design knowledge which is needed during both studentship and professional life. Although there are different practices between design schools, all of the undergraduate industrial design departments have material course in their educational programme. This study deals with how and why the material course are included in undergraduate industrial design departments in Turkey. This study has begun with the literature review. In this section, relation between the industrial design and material science concepts has tried to be revealed {{with the help of the}} previous studies. Literature review part has continued with the comparison of different schools’ material courses. After gathering information on industrial design and material science in the literature review field research has been made. In the field research process interview, survey and observation about material courses are used as study methods. Study sample is chosen as the five oldest industrial design departments in Turkey. Within the scope of the study, all courses related to material knowledge from undergraduate programmes of the industrial design are examined. Their academic programmes have been reviewed, interviews with the lecturers of their material courses have been taken and a survey has been made with the students. And also, two of the material knowledge courses in ITU Department of The Industrial Design have been observed within two semester. In addition to that, by referring the list of Red Dot 2014 Top Design Schools of the America and Europe, material courses of the succesful design schools are examined based on the web based resources. Their course outlines and methods carefully scanned and existence of a common methodology between the material courses of these schools are questioned. Data gathered from the survey and interviews is specified and examined step by steps. At that point, it revealed that data gathered by the survey and the interviews shows similarities and matches with the findings from the literature review. At the end of the study, with the help of the information gained by the survey done by 77 students from 5 different schools and interviews with 6 course lecturers, implications on the most suitable material knowledge of industrial design are tried to be set. Possible subtopics and properties of a suitable material course are outlined in relation to these implications. Properties of an industrial design material course can be defined as Pratice Based Knowledge, Manufacturing Methods and Material Knowledge, Material Selection, Specific Knowledge for Industrial Design, New Technology and New Materials, Technical Visits and Factory Trips, Material Experince, Updating the Material Knowledge and Material Database, Sectoral Differences, Place of the Material Course in Industrial Design Education, Elective Courses, Material Knowledge and Production Cost Relation. These properties of a material course in industrial design is based on the common expressions of the participants of the survey, interviews and literature background of the research. As it is implied by the material education researchers in design field, students who took the survey aim at gaining useful material knowledge, which can be used both in their studentship and profeesional life, from the material courses. They most commonly mention about the lack of the material knowledge in that sense. So, needed material knowledge should be suitable for project courses and their profeesional practice, in other words it must be practice oriented knowledge. What is meant by application in industrial design practice is production. Possible materials which will form the designed object does not mean anything if it can not exist in three dimensionally and this could only possible possible by manufacturing. So, manufacturing methods and material knowledge can not be thought as two completely different educational subjects. Both practical and theoretical expression of material knowledge should involve production methods. One of the basic abilities which are tried to be gained in industrial design education is material selection. So, to calculate the advantages and disadvantages of the material options, to compare the possible materials, ability of the material selection should be involved in the material course. In addition to that material selection ability should not only be formed with the tangible characteristics od the material, intangible properties of the material should be included in the course outline in that sense. In addition to that, all of the individuals who took survey or interview, mention that a specified material knowledge for industrial design is a must in design education and this knowledge must be different from engineering disciplines. Because material knowledge of design and engineering differ in basis of disciplines. Industrial designer should know the literature and basic material properties while communicating with the engineers and other technical staff, however main material knowledge used by the designer is practice and production based. Innovation, improvement, development based design ideas should follow the new technologies. Students whoo took the survey, expressed the need of the involvement of new materials and new technologies in material courses. So, new materials and technologies should be a sub topic of the course. Both students and academicians pointed out the importance of the technical visits and factory trips involved in the material course. Examining production and application of thge material on the field leads to faster learning process. Designer candidates can understand the borders of the material in the means of technical properties, production methods, cost efficiencyin these visits. So, well targeted field trips make the material course more efficient. Another factor which affects the student’s learning process is experiencing the material in the studio. Touching, forming, cutting, boring, drilling, slicing the material by the student make him/her understand the responses of producer and user more easily. With this method, designer candidates can prevent possible negative effects of the material selection. Material courses should include basic knowledge and concepts, details and should encourage the students to update their knowledge. Because of the constantly developing materials, material course should raise the awareness of the students and should be guided on self learning. Needed material knowledge is specified and differentiated according to the related sector. This makes the material knowledge process neverlasting and field based. After taking the material course, students should not loose their interest on learning new materials and should have an idea about how to be informed about newly developed materials. All of the survey and interview participants emphasize the need of taking material course as earliest as possible. So, general material knowledge related to the basic design course can be given within the first academic year and can be specified in following years. It seems more rational to make the students choose their material course related to their interests and future work field. After taking a general material course students should take an elective material course which deals with only one or two materials. With the help of that, student can gain detailed material information. In addition to that, practice option in an elective course make the course more effective. Another important aspect of the material knowledge is cost. Material knowledge without cost information makes it away from the production and real life. Designer can evaluate suitability of the designed product by its technical properties, production cost and target sale price. This study aims at determining the processes and the current courses of material knowledge in undergraduate industrial design education and introducing the importance and the place of material knowledge in design practice. In this study, after gaining information on material knowledge in industrial design by literature review and field research, implications on the future studies and scope of an efficient material course are set. All of the findings shows the need of an specified methodology in industrial design material education. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü Jeoloji Mühendisliği Anabilim Dalı'nda yüksek lisans tezi olarak hazırlanan bu tezde 6 - 10 Şubat 2011 tarihlerinde meydana gelen heyelanlara sebep olan mekanizma araştırılmaya çalışılmıştır. Çalışma alanı 1 / 25. 000 ölçekli topoğrafik haritada Kahramanmaraş L 37 b 3; L 38 a 4 paftaları içinde yer almaktadır. Bu çalışma büro ve arazi çalışmaları olarak 2 aşamada gerçekleştirilmiştir. İlk aşamada bölge hakkında ayrıntılı bir çalışma yapmak amacıyla literatür araştırması yapılmış, ilgili tezler ve raporlar incelenmiş; saha hakkında bilgiler derlenmiştir. Jeoloji haritası olarak arazide Staesche (1972) 'nin haritası kullanılmış ve araziden elde edilen veriler ile harita revize edilmiştir. Sahada ki jeolojik birimler temelden üste doğru incelenmiş; Temel kayaçlar, Mesozoyik karbonatlı kayaçlar, Neojen gölsel çökeller ve Kuvaterner birimler olarak ayrılarak sıralanmışlardır. Bu birimlerin içerisinde ise özellikle Kuvaterner birimler üzerinde durulmuştur ve bu birim kendi içerisinde sahada ki gözlemlere dayanarak akarsu çökelleri, alüvyal yelpaze, taşkın düzlükleri, taraçalar ve kalişler olarak ayrılmıştır. Heyelanlara birçok kaynakta en büyük sebep olarak su gösterilmektedir. Gerek yağışlar gerek akarsular, dereler, kaynaklar ve yeraltı suları ele alınmıştır. Devlet Meteoroloji İşleri'nden alınan 18 yıllık yağmur verileri incelenmiş, ortalamaları ve eklenik sapma değerleri hesaplanmış ve grafiğe dökülerek yorumlanmıştır. Kurak ve yağışlı dönemler belirlenmiştir ve içinde bulunduğumuz dönemin yağışlı <b>dönem</b> olduğu sonucuna varılmıştır. Ortamdaki jeolojik birimler suyu iletebilme özelliklerine göre geçirimsiz, yarı geçirimli ve geçirimli birimler olarak 3 'e ayrılmış, yaşanan heyelan hadiselerine olası etkileri tartışılmıştır. Çalışmanın asıl amacı olan Çöllolar Açık İşletmesi'nin heyelanlar üzerine yorum yapmadan önce heyelan üzerine yapılan çalışmalar araştırılmış, birçok bilim insanının yaptığı sınıflamalar tez içerisinde sıralanmıştır. Çalışma alanında ki heyelanlar arazi çalışmalarında incelenmiş, fotoğrafları alınmış, litolojik özellikleri belirlenmeye çalışılmış ve hareketin şekli ortaya konulmaya çalışılmıştır. Arazi çalışmalarından elde edilen bulgular ve gözlemlere dayalı olarak yapılan değerlendirmeler, batı şevlerinde meydana gelen heyelanın yenilme mekanizmasının progresif kayma modeline uygun olduğunu göstermektedir. Doğu şevlerinde meydana gelen heyelanın yenilme mekanizmasının ise oldukça karmaşık bir yapıda olduğu o kaymanında progresif kayma şeklinde gözlendiği söylenebilir. Bu kayma, birleşik iki kayma yüzeyi üzerinde makaslama yenilmesine bağlı olarak meydana gelmiş olmalıdır. Kaymanın 1. yüzeyini (tabandaki yüzey) killerle geçişli kömür seviyesi, 2. yüzeyini (arka yüzey) ise süreksizlikler oluşturmaktadır. Büyük olasılıkla tabandaki kayma yüzeyinin üzerinde bulunan yeraltı suyu ve tabandaki 1. kayma yüzeyini oluşturan malzemelerin zayıf dayanımına sahip olmaları şevlerdeki heyelanı meydana getiren ana faktörler olmalıdır. Mechanism causing {{landslides}} hit between 6 and 10 February 2011 {{were studied}} to clarify in thesis prepared as Master of Science (M. Sc.) thesis in the Department of Geological Engineering, Institute of Science and Technology, Istanbul Technical University. Study area {{is located in}} Kahramanmaraş L 37 b 3; L 38 a 4 map sections of 1 / 25. 000 scale topographic maps. This study was carried out as office and field work in 2 phases. In the first phase, the literature survey was carried out {{so as to make}} a detailed study about the area, related theses and reports were examined, information about the field was compiled. In the second phase to made the field work by going to land, landslides examined, lithology, slope angle, the region's rainfall, underground and surface water of the predisposing factors causing landslides are examined. Photographed the landslide area. For the obtain strike and dip of the layers of landslide area outside and inside was measured. In the field compass for geologists, geologists hummer, and GPS are used. Staesche (1972) map was used as geological map and data obtained from the field was revised. The geological map which was revised drawn on the computer again and the value of direction and inclination of layers was measured marked on the geological map. However, discontinuities was observed in the geological units marked on the map. In addition to, terraces which can carry water marked to on the map. During the field study, the drilling data from borehole logs made from MTA and EÜAŞ used for the ensuring thickness of coal and other geological units. These borehole logs are made by MTA for determining the the coal mine evaluation. In this study, three of borehole logs are used which are selected close to the mine. In the first, a literature review was carried out about the basin. Then the study area is a coal basin, research is concentrated on coal basins. As a result of this research there are two ways in which class of coal basin that have been found. The first of these types of is according to the environment where the sediments basins. The second is the According {{to the development of the}} shape of the basin and coal basins. According to this informations Afşin-Elbistan coal basin is limnic and asymetric foredeep basin. In this study, the geological units have been approached with informations taken from previous studies. To naming of geological units are avoided from previous studies. Geological units in the field were examined from bottom to top; by separating basement rocks, Mesozoic carbonate rocks, Neogene lacustrine sediments and Quaternary as units were sorted. Among these units, it was particularly focused on the Quaternary units and this unit in itself was separated into the fluvial deposits, alluvial fans, flood plains, terraces and caliches based on observations in the field. Stratigraphic column section of geolocic units are drawn. On this stratigraphic column section is painted with the same color of geological map which used in this study. In addition to divergent between in geological units are shown in this stratigraphic column section. Afşin Elbistan basin is a region that has been exposed quite a lot of tectonic effects. For his reason, this tectonic effects shaped to basin are interpreted. For this purpose, structural features of geological units researched in both litearture survey and in the field. As a result of this researches, it has Watercourse) been found that the Hurman faultline (analogous with Hurman river) narrows the pit field from east and Kışlaköy Faults narrows the pit field from West. Location of these faultlines are marked on the geological transverse section this locations obtained from Staesche (1972). In addition, these geological transverse section are drawn on the computer. Water is shown as the biggest reason of landslides in many sources. As the presence of water in the field, precipitation, streams, creek, springs and groundwater sources are considered. 18 years of rain data received from Turkish State Meteorological Service; mean and cumulative deviations were calculated, graphed and interpreted. Dry and wet periods were determined and it was concluded that the period we are in is the rainy period. Geological units were separated into 3 as impermeable, semi-permeable and permeable; potential impacts on landslides occurred were discussed. Before Çöllolar, the main aim of the study, made comments, the studies conducted on landslides were investigated and classifications made by many scientists were listed in the thesis. Landslides in the study area were examined in the field studies, their photographs were taken and lithological features were tried to be determined and shape of the movement was tried to be revealed. During these researches, especially focused on the progressive landslides and this type of landslides whether suitable to Çöllolar open pit or not was tried to observe in the field. Additionally, in this study, prevention of landslides are takes place too, precuation from landslides was expressed. Assessments based on the findings and observations obtained from area studies have showed that landslides occurred in the western slope are suitable for failure mechanism of the progressive model shift. Landslides occured in the western slope was drawn on the computer with the drawing program and shown the estimated sliding surface. The failure mechanisms of the landslides occurred in eastern slope is quite a complex structure and firstly it can be said that it is in the shape of annular slip based on progressive slide and superficial findings and observations. Landslides occured in the eastern slope was drawn on the computer with the drawing program and shown the estimated sliding surface like other western slope. Progressive slip should be occurred on the combined two slide surfaces depending on shear failure. Permeable coal level with clay constitutes 1 st surface of slide (bottom surface) and discontinuities constitute 2 nd surface (back surface). Most likely, the groundwater on the slide surface on the base, the material forming 1 st slide surface having weak strength should be the main factors of landslides occurrence on the slope. Landslides occured in the Çöllolar open pit's slopes' lithological features shown below of same name of this title in this study and below of this title was indicated water carrying characteristics, thickness, spread features of these slopes' lithological units. The result of experiments conducted with landslide material which taken from slopes are given in this study. These results are internal friction angle, cohesion, unit weight and these results given in this study. Landslides type of the western and eastern slopes was found suitable for progressive landslide from result of literature survey and field work. Many research indicated that water is the main reason of landslides. Water is reason of landslides of the Çöllolar open cast mine,result of interaction with water entering the mine and geological units in the mine is concluded. Water of the Çöllolar open cast mine must be carried with Hurman river and terraces structures. In study area, in terms of water transport terraces located in whole basin very important because these terraces structures overlooks like groove duty. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
40|$|Tez (Yüksek Lisans) [...] İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü, 2015 Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2015 Kamusal mekanların içinde bulundukları <b>dönem</b> ve toplumla birlikte yaşadığı dönüşümler, bazı araştırmacılar tarafından çöküş, bazıları tarafından canlanış, bazıları tarafından ise normal bir süreç olarak ele alınmış, ancak bu konuda yapılan alan çalışmalarının yetersizliği ve sosyal bilimlerin nitel boyutunu çalışma zorluğu gibi nedenlerden dolayı net bir sonuca varılamamıştır. Ayrıca, kamusal mekanların çok sayıda disiplin tarafından ele alınıyor olması, kamusal mekanların tanımlanmasında çeşitliliğe ve buna bağlı olarak da sınıflandırmasında karmaşıklığa yol açmaktadır. Tüm bu karmaşıklığa rağmen, tüm disiplinler tarafından kamusal mekanlardan beklenen ortak özellikler; sosyal yaşantıya olanak sağlaması, çeşitli kullanım ve aktivitelerin bulunması, erişim ve bağlantılarının sağlanmış olması ile özel bir kimlik ve imaja sahip olmasıdır. Bununla birlikte, kamusal mekanlardan beklenen ve kamusal mekanın kalitesini ortaya koyan bu özellikler, farklı sosyo-ekonomik yapılarda farklı şekilde yorumlanabilir ve kamusal mekanlarda farklı şekilde karşılık bulabilirler. Bu nedenle, kamusal mekanları oluştururken tasarımcı ve plancıların, sosyo-ekonomik farklılıkları da göz önünde bulundurmaları gerekmektedir. Sosyo-ekonomik düzeyleri farklı olan kamusal mekanların kullanımları ve bu alanlardaki kullanıcıların mekana yönelik kalite algıları arasında farklılığın bulunup bulunmadığını, varsa bu farklılığın nelerden kaynaklandığını tespit etmeyi amaçlayan bu tez için “farklı sosyo-ekonomik düzeylere sahip kamusal mekanların kullanımı, algılanması ve bu mekanlardan beklentiler arasında anlamlı farklılıklar bulunmaktadır” hipotezi geliştirilmiştir. Tez kapsamında öncelikle çalışmanın amacı ve hipotezde değinilen kamusal mekanın kalitesi hakkında kuramsal bilgiye yer verilmiş ve daha önce yapılan çalışmalar yorumlanmıştır. Sonrasında günümüzde özellikle küreselleşme tartışmaları ile birlikte hız kazanan kamusal mekanın yönetimi, homojenizasyonu ve çöküşü ile canlanışı tartışmaları üzerinde durulmuş ve bu tartışmaların farklı sosyo-ekonomik gruplar açısından önemine değinilmiştir. Bu tez kapsamında ekonomik politikaların da etkisi ile çok hızlı mekansal değişimlerin yaşandığı İstanbul’da farklı sosyo-ekonomik yapıya sahip 4 mahalleden (2 tanesi üst sosyo-ekonomik dereceden, 2 tanesi ise alt sosyo-ekonomik dereceden) 4 adet kamusal mekan tipi seçilmiştir. Farklı sosyo-ekonomik yapılarda bulunan bu mahallelerden seçilen parklarda gözlem ve sözlü görüşme yöntemlerine başvurulmuştur. Alan çalışmasında elde edilen sözlü görüşme verileri sosyal bilimlerde nitel verilerin analiz edilmesinde kullanılan MAXQDA programı ile analiz edilmiş ve böylece araştırma soruları cevaplanarak hipotez test edilmiştir. Analizler yapılırken kullanılan başlıca uygulamalar; Belge Portresi Oluşturma, Kod-Matris Taraması, Tek Vaka Modellemesi ve Etiket Bulutu olarak belirlenmiştir. Yapılan her bir analiz neticesinde ortaya çıkan görsel bulguların ve haritalamaların farklı sosyo-ekonomik gruplar açısından ne anlama geldiği ortaya konulmaya çalışılmıştır. Sonrasında ise ortaya çıkan tüm bulgular mevcut literatür ile karşılaştırılarak yorumlanmıştır. Sonuç olarak, hipotez kabul edilmiş ve farklı sosyo-ekonomik grupların kamusal mekana yönelik tutum ve algıları arasındaki benzerlik farklılıklar ortaya konulmuştur. Bu tezin, mekânsal planlama ve tasarım çalışmalarında özellikle sosyal verilerin analizi ve değerlendirilmesi açısından katkı sağlayacağı düşünülmektedir. Throughout the history, {{developments}} of both democracy and civilizations with successful urban life {{have been provided}} by public spaces where people share the belief and experiences, exchange the ideas, and participate into commercial life. Public spaces contribute to identification of cultural, social, economic and political functions of the cities. Therefore, the public spaces of the cities contain many clues about the cities and their inhabitants. Transformations of public spaces together with society and period have been considered as decline, revival or normal process by several researchers. However, it was not reached to a clear conclusion for reasons such as limited studies on this subject and the challenges of qualitative social sciences. In addition, have been handled by several disciplines of public spaces lead to diversity {{in the definition of}} public spaces and complexity of their classification accordingly. Despite all this complexity, the common features of public spaces qualified by all disciplines are classified under the following four qualities: they are accessible; people are engaged in activities there; comfortable and have a good image; and finally, they are sociable place; one where people meet each other and take people when they come to visit. Accessibility of a public space could be judged by its connections to its surroundings, both visual and physical. A successful public space should be easily get in and get through and, it should be visible both from a distance and up close. Whether a public space is comfortable and presenting itself with good image is considered as key to its success. Comfort is qualified perceptions about safety, cleanliness, and the availability of places to sit. Activities are considered as the basic building blocks of a place. Activities give people a reason to come to public space and return. If people find nothing to do, public space will be empty and that generally means that something is wrong. Sociability is considered as difficult quality for a place to achieve, but once attained it becomes an unmistakable feature. When people see friends, meet and greet their neighbors, and feel comfortable interacting with strangers, they would tend to feel a stronger sense of place or attachment to their community, and to the place that fosters these types of social activities. However, these features that are expected from public spaces and revealing the quality of public spaces could be interpreted in several ways by different socio-economic groups and they find response in a different way in public spaces. Therefore, while creating public spaces, designers and planners should take into account socio-economic differences between places. The hypothesis that “there are significant differences between public spaces from different socio-economic level in terms of their usage, perception and expectations” has been put forward for this thesis which aims to find that both public space usage of different socio-economic groups and availability of differences among quality perception among them. Besides, it was aimed to identify differences where they arise from. In scope of this thesis, literature review has been conducted in the direction of both aim of the study and quality of public space that was addressed in the hypothesis, and previous studies were commented. Afterwards, discussions on management, homogenization, decline and revival of public spaces that outstanding with especially globalization arguments have been emphasized, and the importance of these debates have been handled in terms of different socio-economic groups. In recent years, many researchers especially in social sciences have focused on neighborhood scale to solve urban problems, and they also have given importance neighborhood scale studies for the solution of social problems, as well. The districts of Turkey have been classified under 9 classes (A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, and C-) by an international real estate company which is called REIDIN. This classification was presented with a socio-economic rating report is based on welfare, livability and cultural level of Turkey. In scope of this thesis, 4 neighborhood parks were selected from A+ and C- districts to demonstrate differences between two extreme socio-economic groups. Etiler Sanatcilar Park and Goztepe 60. Yil Park were selected to represent A+ districts, Sultanbeyli Golet Park and Sancaktepe Meydan Park represent C- districts of Istanbul where experienced rapid spatial changes together with economic policies. As a research method, observation and deep interview were conducted in the neighborhood parks where are visited by different socio-economic groups. Face to face - deep interview was conducted with 51 visitors that were selected by random sampling method from study areas in May - 2015. Each interview that 12 - 15 minutes length were recorded by sound recorder device, and also written notes were kept in papers. The records that obtained by oral interviews were transmitted to MAXQDA software as coded datasets. Before the oral interviews, the codes were roughly determined resulting from preliminary research on both quality of public spaces and their usage by different socio-economic groups. In the analysis process, new codes and sub codes were created in accordance with the unexpected details of negotiations. Each interview document that was created for each study area where the oral interviews were conducted was transmitted to software separately. The total four documents from four study areas were classified under the two groups as low socio-economic group and high socio-economic groups. The hypothesis was tested the following analysis by MAXQDA that is used to analyze qualitative data in social sciences. The main tools that were used in analysis; Document portrait, Code matrix browser, MAX Maps – One case model and Tag cloud. Visual findings and mappings that resulting from each analysis revealed the meaning of public spaces in terms of different socio-economic groups. Expectations and behavior in public spaces, in addition to perceptions of them were differentiated between the groups in these areas, since having different life styles, daily urban habits that lead to cultural and economic differences. Thus, the findings that resulted from study areas in scope of the thesis confirm the hypothesis that “there are significant differences between socio-economic groups in terms of use and perception of public spaces and expectations from them”. It is considered that the emergence of these differences resulting from not only economic structure, but also education level, environmental attitudes, length of residence in the city and household type that are thought to be connected with economic structure. The constraints of this thesis which is thought could contribute to literature in terms of public space use of different socio-economic groups are both conducted in a narrow environment since time and supply restriction and excluding of middle income groups from the thesis. In addition, it was difficult to convince of high socio-economic group for deep interview since their cautious attitudes to the strangers. Therefore, it could be recommended that conducting deeper interview with less and less people for further studies. In addition, a study that be conducted on different social groups in public space of urban scale apart from neighborhood scale could contribute to literature. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
40|$|Tez (Yüksek Lisans) [...] İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü, 2012 Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Mimarlığın, Antik Çağ’dan beri toplumdaki güçlü sınıfın gücünü somut ve sürekli kıldığı bilinmektedir. Endüstri Devrimi’yle birlikte oluşan Kapitalist Sistem, sabit ve hiyerarşik güç ilişkilerini esnek ve değişken kılmış, mimarlığın hizmet alanını genişletmiştir. Ancak yine de bu durum, mimarlığın yalnızca gücü yetene bu hizmeti sunduğu gerçeğini değiştirmemektedir. Bunun yanısıra Kapitalist Sistem’in barındırdığı iç çelişkiler, ekolojik tehdit gibi kapitalizme özgü toplumsal sorunların oluşmasına yol açmış, eşitsizlik, bireysel özgürlüklerin ihlali gibi mevcut sorunların ise yalnızca biçim değiştirmesine neden olmuştır. Mimarlık, toplumsal yaşam ile yakın ilişkisi sonucu tüm bu sorunların tam ortasında yer almaktadır. Mevcut toplumsal işleyiş tarafından beslenen ve aynı zamanda da bu işleyişi destekleyen mimarlığın, sistemle ilintili sorunları pekiştirdiği söylenebilir. Mimarlığın büyük toplumsal değişimlere yol açabileceğine dair inancın ortadan kalkmış olmasına rağmen, bu işleyişe karşı çıkan mimarlıkların olabilirliğini görmek umut vericidir. Araştırma kapsamında, mevcut sistemle ilintili bu sorunlar, Ursula Leguin’e ait ‘Mülksüzler’ romanı üzerinden incelenmekte ve bu sorunlara karşı çıkmayı amaç edinen mimari girişimler araştırılmaktadır. Mevcut kapitalist sisteme karşı yeni bir toplum düzenini sorgulayıcı biçimde ele alan Mülksüzler, iki zıt düzeni karşılaştırmaya dayanan diyalektik kurgusu sayesinde, tezin konusuyla olduğu kadar yaklaşımıyla da paralellik içindedir. Mülksüzler’in yazıldığı <b>dönem</b> olan 1968 kuşağı, geçtiğimiz yüzyılda sisteme karşı eleştirel yaklaşımların en çok gündemde olduğu, entelektüel çevrelerin konvansiyonel toplum mekanizmalarına karşı en fazla eleştirel fikir ürettiği dönemlerden biridir. Bu dönemde Marx’ın metinleri ve Diyalektik Materyalizm kuramı yeniden ele alınmış ve dönemin koşullarına göre yeniden yorumlanmıştır. Bu paralellikte Diyalektik Materyalizm üzerine düşünmek ve Diyaektik Materyalizm’i bugünün koşulları kapsamında değerlendirmek, mevcut ileyişe karşı çıkan bir mimarlığın olabilirliği ve bunun olası yöntemleri hakkında fikir vermektedir. David Harvey’in Ursula Leguin’ e de değinerek ortaya attığı Diyalektik Ütopya kavramı, şimdiye kadar üretilen ve sistemin dışında kendi başına var olan ütopik yaklaşımların başarısızlığına karşılık bizzat sistemin içinde ve sistemle birlikte var olmayı başarabilen yaklaşımlara dikkat çekmektedir. Sistemle kurduğu diyalektik ilişki çerçevesinde yer yer sistemle çatışan ve bu sayede sistemi sarsmayı amaç edinen anarşizan yaklaşımlar, bu bağlamda umut vericidir. It {{is obvious}} that since the Antiquity, {{architecture}} has been concretizing {{the power of the}} powerful class. Capitalist System, which has occured through the Industrial Revolution, has transformed the strict and hierarchical power relations into more flexible and changable network, while expanding the area reached by architecture. However this transformation and expansion hasn’t changed the fact that architecture serves only to the people who can afford this service. In addition, the contradictions of Capitalist System have resulted in social problems specific to Capitalism, like ecological threat, and have led to disguise of the existing problems like unequality and violation of individual liberty. As a consequence of close relation with the social life, architecture stands among all these problems. Supporting and being supported by the present system, architecture could be regarded as reinforcing the problems within the system. Despite the disappearance of the belief that architecture can lead to social changes, it is hopeful to see the existence of opposing approaches. Within the scope of this dissertation, the problems related to the present system and architectural attempts which target these problems, are investigated over the novel ‘the Dispossesed’ which belongs to Ursula LeGuin. Architecture, reflecting the existing social order and relationships, and consequently concretizing the dominant ideology, also embodies and intensifies the problems related to the present system in contemporary societies which are mostly shaped by capitalist relations. In other words, the ability and possibility of architecture to be an opposing force against the capitalist system which also can support and feed on is the main focusing subject of this dissertation. While being extremely contributive to the philosophical criticism of the social thinking in search for better and alternative solutions to the existing society mechanisms since the Enlightenment Era, utopias still {{failed to live up to}} the ideas which were the main reasons for their creations when they were brouht up to real life. At this point, roughly two major approaches can be observed. One is being against the system within the system itself and two is functioning completely outside the system. The classical utopian approach which proved to be unsuccesful defines a whole new one and true model of society disregarding all the existing terms of daily life and the effecting mechanisms. This approach can be identified as formal logic and is the main reason for the failure of the classical utopian ideas. In contrast with this, the idea of becaming an opposing force within the society itself reveals the situations of different and contradicting ideologies fighting each other. The proggresive ideology within the dialectic logic is ultimately built on this contradictions of different ideologies. The Dispossesed which is instrumentalized within the thesis in search for the new approaches that oppose the existing social system, helps the study with its dialectic structure and its holistic approach. The era when The Dispossesed was written has also witnessed the 1968 revolts that idealized the opposing against any existing social mechanisms. This era has also created a new Marxist approach that highlighted the importance of redeciphering the Marxist dialectic logic with the help of the existing conditions. This approach which has been instrumentalized within the content of the dissertation in search for new ways of intrepreting the capitalist system of contemporary conditions and arguing the possible ways of opposing it also addes the notion of spacetime continium to the gap between the idealized utopian dreams and the existing life conditions. As a result of this,the opposing ideas that lived on the contradictions between the forms and the processes were mainly debated. While the dialectic approach foresees the acceptance of change in the man-made environment, materialism focuses on the situations that occur in the daily life and the mechanisms of the system itself rather than the utropian ideas as a way out from the existing social mechanism. As a result of contemporary holistic approach, the defined border between the white and the black has been blurred and the ideologies have lost their strictly identified truths. The age old hierarchical power relations which became complicated even more, distort the focuses of the strategies that aim to solve the social problematics. This situations makes the act of opposing against the negativities of a social system and creating an ideology that aims a better life ever harder. In today’s world which dissolves the social unity and favores the individual interests what is ultimately needed is the debating of the unwanted situations holistically with all their inputs and formulating individual actions against it. Architectural practice is suitable for that kind of an approach for it both feeds on the intellectual heritage of the human thinking and the close relationship it has with the practical daily situations. The dominating idea about architecture’s role on the social mechanisms is that it is rather powerless against any major social order. But given the immense effect of the artificial environment over the society, the architecture still can be a triggering factor on any given social change. The major focus point is revealed to be the relationship between the architectural know how which foresees what needs to be done or what needs to be changed and the existing living conditions of an artificial social environment. The social change that is to be planned and idealized has to feature both these factors. Three major social problems have been identified and debated holistically along with their main reasons in order to confront the negativities created by the existing capitalist system and create strategies to oppose and prevent those negativities. The social discrimination, the restriction of the individual freedoms and the echological thread are considered to be the vital three problems of the society that needs immediate acts of solutions. The role of architecture discipline among these three major problems is discussed and the possible solutions to these problems are mentioned. One of the possible architectural acts against the social discrimination which is dramatically solidified through the man-made environments can be the spreading the architectural service wider amongs all the layers of the society. This approach aims the architectural service to be a social project that helps the people who otherwise would never get any since the practice itself is defined to be a privileged act of service for the upper class citizens of any given society. Within the context of the thesis, freedom is defined as the right of an individual to have the ability of choice over his/her own life. This freedom includes the very artificial environment the person lives in. The factors that rule the spatial organization prevents the individuals from having desicions over their environments hence eliminating their freedom. One of the most important responsibilites of the architectural practice about this issue could be the involvment of the space owners to the designing of the environments or at least creating more diverse spatial organizations which would help different kinds of individuals. The most wide spread caution against the major environmental thread is the usage of the recycled materials. This caution when interpreted in an architectural manor can be the re-using of the deserted urban spaces and the buildings with minor interference. This approach is derived as an opposing idea against the widely sponsored consuming habits. The demolition of the existing urban patterns and the deserted buildings unless it is crucially necessary, can be defined as the urban scaled versions of the disposable consumer materials of the daily life. The reusing of the mentioned spaces can be regarded as a possible architectural strategy against the environmental thread. When the possibilities of the architectural opposing is debated through the previously mentioned three major problems on a theorotical level, it is revealed that the unified ideological truths and the formal methods of the last century are proven to be inefficient. In contrast to that, the strategies which are created over the holistic definitions and the interpetations of the daily life circumstances are more effective. In todays world which witnesses the sayings of all the ideologies dissolving in the materialism of the capital market, the approaches which relate to the daily life are one step further than the ideological utopian dreams which do not relate to the existing life conditions. Architecture in that direction gives hope in its close relationship to the daily life of every individual. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

Unitized {{curtain wall}} {{systems have been}} widely seen on {{high-rise}} buildings’ façades by bringing benefits with regard to ease of construction, lightness, etc. However, some design and application problems related to structural and infiltration performance of a façade system might arise during its lifetime, which is difficult for the building to compensate. Therefore, tests related to building façade system performance are of importance for assuring the comfort requirements and reducing the maintenance and repair costs as well as preventing the potential problems which may be faced during building’s lifetime. Full-scale preconstruction curtain wall mock-up testing is today normally considered a standard practice for buildings where the curtain wall is a custom application for high-rise buildings, and for buildings where a high confidence level is desired. Within {{the scope of this}} work, real time and full-scale performance tests in accordance with the load-bearing and impermeability criteria are performed on an outdoor test rig for a unitized glass curtain wall panel which is mostly applied on high-rise buildings. The study is based on the principle of the determination of performance change depending on wind pressure increase in upper stories of high-rise buildings and the variations of climatic conditions during the building’s lifetime. Full-scale mock-up testing of two identical unitized curtain wall panels was carried out. During the testing process, one specimen was subjected to a prescribed fatigue process before conducting the standard test procedures while only the standard test procedures were applied on the other identical specimen. In total, six test sequences were conducted on the reference Specimen P and fatigued Specimen FP. The categories of the tests for P are air infiltration, water penetration under static pressure, wind resistance, seismic resistance as the standard tests. Water penetration under dynamic pressure tests and fatigue procedure were the additional tests for FP along with the standard tests. After each test sequence, quantitative results were determined and checked whether the limit values of the related standards were exceeded. Various experimental behavioral parameters of the two panels are presented with graphics. This thesis consists of six Chapters: In Chapter 1, the aim, scope, method and motivation for this study are given. The existing curtain wall systems are classified and general information was given considering the systems and the components in Chapter 2. Afterwards, minimum performance requirements to compensate the load-bearing and impermeability criteria are explained. Additionally, information regarding the unitized panel systems in particular is presented. Chapter 3 is the main chapter of the thesis and comprises of the testing sequence, full-scale experimental study, and quantitative test results. In Chapter 4, a numerical performance evaluation study is performed by using the experimental data obtained from the experimental study. Widely used numerical methods such as AHP, COPRAS, and TOPSIS were selected for the performance evaluation of the standard and fatigue tested panels by taking into account of multi-criteria as load-bearing and impermeability. With the help of these evaluation methods, comparative lifetime performances of the tested panels were obtained and critical level of the tested panels denoting the loss of performance was found. A general summary and evaluation of the thesis is given in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 presents the results obtained from the experimental work and also includes the suggested potential future studies for fulfilling the topic covered in this thesis. The experimental study was carried out on a large test rig located at the Façade Testing Institute, at Çatalca. Air infiltration, static and dynamic penetration, resistance to wind load, seismic resistance and fatigue test procedures were conducted for the full scale façade specimens. The test specimens consist of two identically detailed unitized curtain wall systems with 2, 40 m width, 4, 45 m height dimensions, and are comprised of aluminum framing members and insulating glass units. In total, 10 tests were conducted for the standard and fatigue specimens at five phases during 15 months with different intervals between each testing sequence. After completing each testing phase, the test specimens were exposed under environmental effects till the next phase. Air infiltration tests have been conducted in accordance with TS EN 1253 standard where the air infiltration limit value is set as 1, 5 "m" ^" 3 " "/" "m" ^" 2 " "h". Static water penetration tests have been conducted in accordance with TS EN 12155 standard and impermeability of the specimens were observed during the tests where quantitative data were not possible to obtain due to the testing procedure. Wind resistance tests have been conducted in accordance with TS EN 12179 standard, the 15 mm deflection limit value given by the standard was taken into consideration. Seismic resistance tests have been conducted in accordance with AAMA 501. 4 and AAMA 501. 7 standards where a horizontal movement/displacement was applied on the lower beams placed on the specimens in the amount stated in the standard. Potential damages were conducted following these tests. Dynamic water penetration tests have been conducted in accordance with AAMA 501. 1 standard. A ROTAX aircraft type engine was used as a wind generator simultaneously with high pressure water application on the specimen. The water penetration of the inner surface of the specimen was inspected during the tests. The fatigue procedure application has been performed in accordance with ETAG 17 standard. Suction was applied in accordance with the standard. At the end of the test, the specimen was scrutinied whether there is any deficiency or failure. Both specimens used in the experimental part of the study are identical and 5 performance tests were conducted on each one during a 450 day long test process. Generally accepted and prevalently used standard test procedures were applied on specimen P whereas two additional procedures were conducted on specimen FP to fatigue the façade system in order to obtain more realistic results regarding the long term performance of the unitized curtain wall panels. These tests were defined as dynamic impermeability test comprising water spray application with high wind pressure and ETAG 17 comprising gradual increase in air pressure and sudden application of suction loads. A multi-criteria performance evaluation was conducted with the obtained experimental data by considering the load-bearing and impermeability criteria. Multiple criteria evaluation methods, namely AHP, COPRAS and TOPSIS, were used {{within the framework of the}} performance evaluation and the results were compared. One single and several best options to present the purpose or purposes were chosen by the performance evaluation method related with the decision making. The definition of the multiple criteria decision is being carried out by determining the criteria related to the problem as well as determining the suitability of the alternatives in relation to the chosen criteria. The multiple criteria decision process can be defined generally as defining the problem, determination of the assessment criteria, preparation of the criterion layers and their standardisation, the definition of the criterion weights and the application of the decision analysis. Assessment criteria have to be determined after defining the problem during the decision analysis. The criteria which were defined with regard to the purposes of the decision problem have to be measurable by a number indicating the choices of the decision maker. A total of 10 criteria have been identified in the study. The alternative with the highest numerical value received higher points during the scoring of the alternatives in the assessment. Therefore, a high score value indicates a high numerical result meaning that the relevant alternative provides values, which are closer to the borderlines values. The condition of being close to borderline values, proves that the relevant alternative provides more critical results in comparison to other results. The “critical level” was defined within the performance evaluation process and it indicates the values (%) of the obtained performance indicators as a result of the assessment results. The performance indicator data obtained from the calculations of the AHP, COPRAS and TOPSIS methods, were utilized during the numerical assessment process. Here, the critical levels of the samples at the 0 th, 90 th, 270 th, 390 th and 450 th days were calculated. As a result of the performance evaluations, it has been determined that it is not possible to ignore the climatic effects on the building structure in which the façade system is mounted. Acquirement of appropriate results in a unitized curtain wall panel system which has been tested with adherence to the prevalently used experimental procedure, or in other words, the results which are not exceeding the limit values given in the standards, do not mean that this wall system will not experience any damage throughout its lifetime. One important result obtained as a result of this present study is that a unitized curtain wall panel system, which has been tested without taking into consideration the unexpected conditions it may endure, may face a shorter life expectancy in case it is exposed to these untested conditions.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2014 Günümüzde elektrik enerjisinin kullanımı oldukça yaygın bir hale gelmiş olup, hem günlük hayatta hem de iş hayatında bir zorunluluk haline gelmiştir. Oluşan kısa süreli elektrik kesintileri, hayatımızı durma noktasına getirmektedir. Ekonomik büyüme, bilimsel-teknolojik gelişme ve nüfus yoğunluğundaki artış elektrik enerji talebini her geçen gün arttırmaktadır. Bu nedenle üretim tesislerinden iletim, dağıtım şebekeleri ve son tüketiciye kadar elektrik enerjisinin sağlanmasında görev alan tüm birimler bu talebe hazırlıklı olmalıdır. Bu hazırlık, gelecek dönemlerin önceden talep tahminin yapıldığı planlama çalışması sonucunda gerçekleştirilebilir. Elektrik enerjisinin üretiminden tüketicilere kadar ulaşmasında görev alan tüm şebekeler incelendiğinde en karmaşık yapıya sahip şebekenin dağıtım şebekeleri olduğu açık bir gerçektir. Dolayısıyla dağıtım şebekelerinin planlanmasında farklı kriterlerin göz önünde bulundurulması gerekmektedir. Karmaşık şebeke yapısının doğal sonucu olarak belirlenen kriterlerin karşılandığı birden çok çözüm seçeneği ortaya çıkabilmektedir. Bu nedenle, yapılan planlama çalışmalarının belirlenen kriterleri karşılamakla birlikte, kriterleri karşılayabilen olası alternatif çözümlerden en uygun olanının seçimini de içermesi gerekmektedir. Farklı değerlendirme kriterlerinin bulunduğu durumlarda karar verme, sadece dağıtım yatırımları için değil tüm kararlar için oldukça zordur. Bu zorluğun aşılması amacıyla çok kriterli karar verme yöntemleri geliştirilmiştir. Çok kriterli karar verme yöntemlerinin amacı; birden fazla kriterin olduğu durumlarda karar verme aşamasındaki belirsizlikleri ortadan kaldırmak ve karar verme sürecini belirli yapıya sokarak formülize etmek ve dökümantasyona hazırlamaktır. Yapılan bu çalışmada, ele alınan örnek bir dağıtım şebekesi için geleceğe ait tahmini yük artışı belirlenmiştir. Hem mevcut hem de gelecek <b>dönem</b> yük talebi dikkate alınarak zayıf nokta analizleri yapılmış ve problemli noktalar tespit edilmiştir. Bu problemlerin giderilmesi için; mevcut şebekenin güçlendirilmesi, gerilim dönüşümü ve dağınık üretim birimlerinin bağlanması şeklinde üç farklı alternatif çözüm sunulmuştur. Alternatiflerin değerlendirilmesi için genel anlamda ekonomik, teknik ve çevresel etkiler bazında sekiz farklı hedef ve kriterler belirlenmiştir. Alternatiflerin değerlendirilmesinde çok kriterli karar verme yöntemlerinden TOPSIS (For the {{technique}} for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) yöntemi kullanılmıştır. Her bir kriterin önemi, farklı ağırlık katsayıları verilerek belirlenmiştir. Ağırlık katsayıları değerlendirilerek belirtilen çözümler karşılaştırılmış ve uygun çözüm/çözümler belirlenmiştir. Her üç duruma ait karşılaştırma sonuçlarından çok kriterli karar vermede ağırlık katsayılarının önemi görülmüştür. Bu nedenle yatırımlara karar vericilerin hedeflerin, kriterlerin belirlenmesine ve ağırlıklandırılmasına ne kadar önem vermeleri açıkça ortaya çıkmaktadır. Nowadays, {{the usage of}} electrical energy has become a quite common. It has become a necessity in both daily life and business life. The short term power interruptions, bring the human life to a standstill. The demand to the electrical energy has increased day by day regarding to economic growth, scientific-technologic improvement and population growth. For this reason, all units which take a role from generation units to transmission, distribution system and also to the last consumer should be ready and well prepared for the increased demand. When the systems which are the parts from generation to the end customer are examined, {{there is no doubt}} that the distribution systems are the most complex one and they are in touch with the end customer. Therefore, so many criterias are needed to be taken into account in distribution system planning. In the past distribution planning studies, the planners were just taking into accounts the technical criterias like maximum voltage drop, overloading issues, technical losses etc. However, distribution utilities have realised that criterias just only for the technical issues is not enough in the competitive energy market. If the distribution utilites would like to survive in this market, they need to take into account the economical criterias besides the technical criterias. Otherwise, they can not withstand. Recent researches show that the economics of the distribution systems can be divided in three categories as capital cost, operation-maintenance cost and cost of losses. Some of these criterias is directly related to the technical issues, but some of them is related to financial problems in the utility. And also, some researches are done for combining these two things like selection of the optimal conductor for the system. Furthermore, technical and economical criterias are not enough to be sure about the investments. Some new criterias are involved to this process regarding to the changes in regulations, developments of economonics, technology. These criterias can be the supply quality, average interruption duration, average interruption frequency, customer satisfaction, environmental impacts (Green gas effect, CO 2, NOx emission etc.), visual esthetics, safety etc. As a result, the number of criteria are increasing with the development of the life. There can be so many alternative solutions as a natural result of the complex distribution systems. Implementing the first solution into the distribution system can cause a mistake. Thus, the distribution system planning study needs to include selection of the best alternative solution from alternative solutions which provides the defined criterias and goals. Deciding in a case with too many evaluation criterias and goals is very difficult for the decision makers in distribution utilities. However, this problem is not only for the distribution utilities. Hence, multiple criteria decision methods are improved to handle this problem. Recent researches show that evaluation of the real estate value,financial activities of the businesses and banks are analyzed with multiple criteria decision methods. The main aim of multi criteria decision methods is eliminating the uncertainties in decision making process with multiple criteria, creating a structure to be formulized and documentated. There are too many multi criteria decision methods regarding to the uncertainty and alternative number constraints. One of the multi criteria decision method TOPSIS (For {{the technique}} for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) can be used when no uncertainty appears in the problem variables and the comparability among the alternatives is not limited. In this study, multi criteria decision method is used for selection of the best alternative in distribution planning. A sample distribution system is modeled as geographically in PSS®Sincal v 9. 0 which is a network analysis software. The geographical network model let users see the routes of feeders, connections between the feeders and problematic areas better than schematic model. This sample distribution system is supplied from 31, 5 / 15, 8 kV MV/MV substation via 10 (12, 5) MVA power transformer. There are 5 outgoings from 15, 8 kV busbar, 142 distribution transformers (15, 8 / 0, 4 kV) and 141 km medium voltage lines (overhead lines and cables) in the sample distribution system. Existing active power demand of the system is 10, 11 MW. Load growth factor is defined as 5, 8 % for the sample distribution system for future power demand. The future active power demand of the systems is 13, 392 MW. The weak point analyzes are done for both existing and future term load conditions, and the problems in the system are detected for each term. The main reason of analyzing future term is understanding the future requirements and be ready for future with the new investments. In weak point analyzes, Newton-Raphson load flow method is used. As a result of weak point analyzes, the technical results and especially the voltage drop problems are shown with colour filter regarding to the limits in the graphics. For solving these problems, three different alternative solutions are proposed. First solution alternative is keeping the operating voltage as it is (15, 8 kV) and reinforcing of the existing system. In this solution alternative, the mainlines are reinforced, the overloaded distribution transformers are replaced with suitable higher capacity and adding a new power transformer 10 (12, 5) MVA to the MV/MV substation. Second alternative solution proposes a voltage conversion of the whole system. The operation voltage of the system is converted 15, 8 kV to 31, 5 kV. All feeder outgoings are disconnected from 15, 8 kV busbar and reconnected to the 31, 5 kV busbar. This MV/MV substation is converted as a MV distribution substation. According to the 31, 5 kV operating voltage, all the distribution transformers are replaced with the new ones. Third solution alternative proposes to add a new distributed generation units by using the hydro potentials in the area of the distribution system. These units are connected to the end of feeders where the voltage drop problems are seen. To evaluate the solution alternatives for selecting the best one, the goals and criterias are defined and can be classified as economical, technical and environmental impacts like in recent studies. The cost of capital, operating, maintenance cost and cost of losses are the parts of economical criterias. Maximum voltage drop, loss ratio in medium voltage level, system constraints (maximum power capability), supply quality (power can be supplied in an interruption case) are the technical criterias. The only criteria for environmental impact is CO 2 emission because of the fossil fuel of the generation units. In the evaluation part, TOPSIS (For the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) method which is the common method in multi criteria decision methods is used. The criterias are weighted with different coefficients according to the importance in evaluation process. Regarding to the weighted coefficients in the first evaluation case, second solution alternative is selected as the best solution. The reason of the selection, second alternative takes the first position in the criterias which have 60 % weight, and in rest of the criterias it takes the second position with a tiny differences from the first position. These reasons make the second alternative as the best. To emphasize the importance of weighted coefficients for the criterias, the evaluation studies are done with two other weighted coefficient cases. In the second evaluation case of the coefficients, the first alternative selected as the best alternative. The reason of this selection is that capital cost criteria has 40 % weight where the first alternative is the best solution. And supply quality criteria which has 25 % weight where the first alternative has no solution and shares second position with its biggest competitive second alternative solution. In other criterias second alternative solution has advance rather than first, but this advantage is not enough to be selected the second solution as best one. In the third evaluation case of the coefficients, the third alternative solution selected as the best alternative. The reason of this selection depends on the 40 % weight in the supply quality. In this criteria, just only the third alternative provides a solution. The other two alternatives can not provide any solution, and this makes the third alternative solution as the positive ideal solution in evaluation process. Although, the third alternative has not taken the first position in any other criterias, it takes the whole points from supply quality criteria and win the competition against to the other alternatives. In conclusion, all three alternative solutions are compared with each other with taking into account the weighted coefficients. As a result of this comparison, the crucial contribution of the weighted coefficients in multi criteria decision making is shown up. Accordingly, it is absolutely clear that the decision makers in distribution utilites have to put emphasis on defining the goals, criterias and weighted coefficients to select the best alternative. Therefore, the distribution utilities should create their own decision team which includes employees from different responsibilities and experiences. However, these decision teams may not be fair. This situation can cause an unfair competition between the distribution companies. To prevent this problem, energy market regulatory authorities have to define the limits for the criterias, audit each distribution companies’ decision teams and check the decisions to balance the rights with the other distribution companies. Also, the investments which are the results of this decision process can be monitored according to the criterias. These results can be used as a feedback for the importance of the weighted coefficients. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

Bu çerçevede çalışmada farklı özellikleri olan bölgelerdeki şehir planlama kararlarının ve bu kararların verildiği plan oluşum süreçlerinin kentsel mekanda arazi değer artışları üzerindeki etkilerinin gösterilmesi amaçlanmış olup İstanbul ilinden iki bölge örnek alan olarak belirlenmiştir. Tez kapsamında öncelikle dünya genelinde büyükkentlerin üst ölçek planlarının oluşum süreçleri incelenmiş ve plan değerlendirme kriterleri çerçevesinde İstanbul İli Çevre Düzeni Planı ile karşılaştırmalı analizi yapılarak İstanbul İli içinden çalışma konusu için uygunluk gösteren alanlar belirlenmiştir. Çalışma alanlarının belirlenmesinde esas alınan plan değerlendirme kriterleri; planın dışsal tutarlılığı ve planın etkileme derecesi olarak belirlenmiştir. Yapılan değerlendirme neticesinde çalışmada irdelenen problemin test edileceği örnek alanlar olarak nazım plan kararları etkisinde gelişen Beyoğlu İlçesi ile parsel bazında plan kararları etkisinde gelişen Şişli ilçeleri içinden altbölgeler seçilerek plan kararlarının arazi değer artışları üzerindeki etkileri incelenmiştir. Çalışmada uygulama görmüş olan plan kararlarını kapsayan <b>dönem</b> olan 2006 - 2010 yılları esas alınmış olup örnek alanlarda bu dönemdeki planlama süreçleri içerisindeki plan kararları, nitelikleri ve oluşum süreçleri bakımından sınıflanmış ve bu plan kararlarının mekansal dağılımları ortaya konmuştur. Ardından 2006 ve 2010 yılları için, çalışma alanı dahilinde, ele alınan planlama kararlarının verildiği alanlara bitişik parsellere cepheli sokak ve caddelere ilişkin birim m² arazi değerleri saptanmış ve bu değerlerin yine 2006 ve 2010 yılları için plan kararlarıyla karşılaştırmalı analizi yapılmıştır. Son olarak da her bir analiz alanının hem kendi içinde hem de birbirleriyle gruplandırma, korelasyon ve regresyon yöntemleri ile kıyaslanarak benzerlik ve farklılık gösteren özellikleri saptanmıştır. Elde edilen sonuçlar göstermektedir ki stratejik kararların alındığı, belirli bir vizyon temelli üst ölçek plan kararlarından bağımsız olarak verilmiş olan parsel bazında plan kararlarından içinde ticaret alanı olan ve emsal artışı öneren plan kararları, nazım plan kararlarından farklı olarak yüksek düzeyde ve noktasal arazi değer artışları oluşturmaktadır. Çalışmada plan kararlarının arazi değer artışları üzerindeki etkileri incelenirken 2006 - 2010 yılları arasındaki değişimler ve plan kararları dikkate alınmış olup çalışmanın yapıldığı örnek alanlarda 2010 yılı sonrasında da parsel bazında plan kararlarıyla kentsel mekanda uygulamalar devam etmektedir. Bu çalışmada elde edilen bulgular bundan sonra bu konuda yapılacak çalışmalara yön vermesi bakımından önem arz etmektedir. The {{main problem}} {{addressed}} {{in this study is}} that in such cases where urban planning decisions are constituted independently from the strategic upper-scale plan decisions which are based upon a specific vision, there take place local value increases which do not cover the whole area. Within this framework, it is aimed to put forth the effects of urban planning decisions in regions with different characteristics and the relevant planning processes where these decisions are taken on the land value increases in the urban space. To this aim, different methods were used so as to test the problem examined herein in line with the various assumptions and literature review was conducted for the theoretical framework. Establishment of the theoretical framework covers a general literature research for the already developed theories in this field and the previously conducted studies. Accordingly, the subjects designated as the main areas of interest of this study are as follows: rent-value concept, urban ground rent, land values, urban planning processes and economic value relations of the urban planning processes. Urban planning decisions, based on their nature, cause different effects on the land values and when functions change with zoning decisions, effects on the land values differentiate as well. In line with this assumption, land value increases which are connected with the urban planning decisions for different regions and with different functions were analyzed. Furthermore, lands which are located around the plan decisions proposing commercial activities bring about value increases. This finding is important to lay down the relation between the plan decisions suggesting commercial activities and the land values in the examined regions of the study. Among the social reinforcement areas, urban green space plan decisions create value increases for the surrounding lands and houses. Therefore, effects of the urban green spaces, which are proposed under the different plan formation processes, on the land value increases were analyzed and which characteristics of the green spaces are effective on the land values were determined. After the theoretical framework regarding economic value relation of the urban planning processes was specified; London, New York, Paris, Montreal and Lisbon were chosen among the large cities worldwide, their upper-scale formation processes were examined, plan success assessment was performed on the basis of certain assessment criteria and the elements which are pertaining to economic effects of the planning decisions on the urban space were designated. Plan assessment criteria were specified as internal coherence, external coherence, plan relevance to the city needs and ambitions, public participation, commitment of human and financial resources and plan effectiveness. Subsequently, plan success assessment of Istanbul Environmental Plan was performed based on the assessment criteria above and it was analyzed comparatively with upper-scale plans of the large cities worldwide. Plan assessment criteria which are important for the the case study are external coherence and plan effectiveness. As a result of the analysis, it is found that sub-scale planning and application activities which are generally conforming to the plan decisions were conducted for New York, London, Montreal and Paris plans whereas sub-scale planning and application activities which are partially conforming to the plan decisions were conducted for Lisbon plan. When Istanbul Environmental Plan was compared with the sub-scale planning decisions and applications, many applications were found out to be independent from the strategic objectives, policies and planning decisions of the upper-scale. The fact that Istanbul Environmental Plan includes strategic objectives and planning decisions which do not match up with the sub-scale planning decisions and applications especially in the central business district and in the north of the conventional central business district and that there are plans and applications independent from upper-scale plans due to plot-based plan decisions such as local zoning plans and plan amendments, etc. in these areas are among the issues that come forward regarding the problem {{addressed in this}} study. Within this framework, the areas which are suitable for this study were designated in Istanbul. Pursuant to the assessments, sub-regions were selected - as the sample areas where the problem herein will be tested - from Beyoglu district which has developed under the influence of master plan decisions and Sisli district which has developed under the influence of plot-based plan decisions and effects of the plan decisions on land value increases were examined. Years 2006 - 2010 which cover the applied plan decisions have been taken as basis in the study; plan decisions within the planning processes of the sample areas were classified in terms of their qualities and constitution processes and spatial distribution of these plan decisions were put forth. Subsequently, land values per square meter were established for the streets and avenues which face the plots adjoining to the areas for which the adressed planning decisions were taken between 2006 and 2010, and these values were analyzed again comparatively with the plan decisions of 2006 - 2010. Finally, each survey area was compared in itself and with one another through grouping, correlation and regression methods and similarities and differences were specified. Following the analysis results of street and avenue groups and according to the field visits in the sub-regions of Beyoglu district and the interviews held with real estate agents, there were determined different characteristics and applications effective on the land value increases, apart from the master plan decisions. Different characteristics of the area are that buildings which face the streets and avenues are new and well-kept; there are no worn-out and unused buildings; streets and avenues are more favorable in terms of topography and slope and the region is preferable due to social environment and security issues. Morever, some applications carried out by the local municipality in the region are the efective factors apart from the plan decisions. These applications of the local municipality include the street landscaping and facade arrangements as well as the works performed at the entrances/exits of the subways for transportation. Besides, pursuant to the analysis, it is understood that land value increase rates of the streets and avenues which are located in the sub-regions of Beyoglu district and remain under the influence of master plan decisions are close to the general average and exhibit a homogenous distribution while land value increase rates of the streets and avenues which are located in the sub-regions of Sisli district and remain under the influence of plot-based plan decisions have great differences. Therefore, the two sub-regions are observed to have distinct characteristics. According to the correlation analysis which aim to designate the relation of the land value increase rates with the master plan and plot-based plan decisions, it is seen that effectiveness of the plot-based plan decisions, which are taken in the sub-region of Sisli district, on the land value increase rates is different from the master plan decisions, in the sub-region of Beyoglu district and it causes a positive effect of higher degree. Correlation analysis results show that in order to specify the effects of function types on the land values, it would be more convenient to separate the plot-based plan decisions and master plan decisions and to find out their respective level of effectiveness. As a result of the multiple regression analysis which were conducted to find out the relation between land value increase rates and master plan decisions, it is implied that health facility (hospital) area and park-square area plan decisions which are proposed in all master plan decisions of the sub-region of Beyoglu district cause low-level increases on the surrounding land values. Land value increases which are caused by the health facility (hospital) area plan decision are higher than the increases triggered by the park and square plan decision in all master plan decisions taken in the sub-region of Beyoglu district. Planning the health facility (hospital) areas based on the regional needs and in a manner to serve the region increases its availability and significance and correspondingly creates positive effect on the land values. Considering the master plan decisions in the sub-region of Beyoglu district, aerial size of the park and square plan decisions changes the effect of the concerned plan decisions on the land values. It is possible to see the aerial size of the park and square plan decisions as a factor which is effective on land values. In the park and square plannings, aerial sizes and design principles may increase usability of these areas and render more functional uses. Therefore, availability, functionality and design quality of the parks and squares may create increases on the surrounding land values. As a result of the multiple regression analysis which were conducted to find out the relation between land value increase rates and plot-based plan decisions; it is seen that plot-based plan decisions in the sub-region of Sisli district cause high-level of effects on the surrounding land value increase rates, in contrast to the master plan decisions in the sub-region of Beyoglu district. It is possible to explain this situation {{with the fact that the}} plot-based plan decisions are not a part of the plan decisions which cover the whole region, they are not developed in line with the urban demands and needs of the whole region and they lead to value increases in their immediate environment. Among the plot-based plan decisions applied in the sub-region of Sisli district, even if the aerial size of the trade-tourism area, trade-service-house (mixed use) area and transfer center area plan decisions differentiate, they create centers of attraction by providing commercial activities, economic activities and dynamism in the surroundings. Therefore, they result in high level of land value increases in the immediate vicinity. In addition to the differences of functional types, taking the equivelant increase suggestions into evalution is important to explain the effects of plot-based plan decisions on the land value increases more accurately and healthily. When effects of the plot-based plan decisions on the land value increases are assessed, together with the equivalent increase suggestions, in the sub-region of Sisli district, they are observed to cause high-level of land value increases in the immediate vicinity in parallel with the aerial assessment and the analysis performed only with the function types. Plan decisions which affect the land value increases both according to aerial values and also independently from them are, at the same time, the plan decisions which propose equivalent increase. It is seen that equivalent increase suggestions of the plan decisions are an important factor which has an effective role in land value variances. The obtained results show that among the plot-based plan decisions which are taken independently from the strategic upper-scale plan decisions which are based upon a specific vision, those which include commercial areas and suggest floor area ratio increase constitute high level and local land value increases, contrary to master plan decisions. While effects of the plan decisions on the land value increases were examined in the study, changes and plan decisions between 2006 - 2010 were taken into account and in the sample areas of the study, urban applications still continue in post- 2010 period as well through plot-based plan decisions. Findings to be obtained in this study are important in that they would guide the following studies in this field. DoktoraPh...|$|E
