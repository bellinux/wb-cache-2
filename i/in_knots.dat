40|$|ABSTRACT. We study Legendrian <b>knots</b> <b>in</b> a cabled <b>knot</b> type. Specifically, given a topological knot type K, we {{analyze the}} Legendrian <b>knots</b> <b>in</b> <b>knot</b> types {{obtained}} from K by cabling, {{in terms of}} Legendrian <b>knots</b> <b>in</b> the <b>knot</b> type K. As a corollary of this analysis, we show that the (2, 3) -cable of the (2, 3) -torus knot is not transversely simple and moreover classify the transverse <b>knots</b> <b>in</b> this <b>knot</b> type. This is the first classification of transverse <b>knots</b> <b>in</b> a non-transversely-simple <b>knot</b> type. We also classify Legendrian <b>knots</b> <b>in</b> this <b>knot</b> type and exhibit the first example of a Legendrian knot that does not destabilize, yet its Thurston-Bennequin invariant is not maximal among Legendrian representatives <b>in</b> its <b>knot</b> type. 1...|$|R

Prior {{to being}} cast <b>in</b> <b>Knots</b> Landing, Mills was {{primarily}} known {{for playing the}} [...] "damsel in distress" [...] archetype in both film and television media. The actress became somewhat famous for playing these roles, often leading to unwanted typecasting.

[...] According to Jacobs, Abby was not planned when the show began. He knew that he wanted a female J.R. Ewing-esque character.

500|$|Valene [...] "Val" [...] Ewing (maiden name Clements, {{formerly}} Gibson, Waleska), {{portrayed by}} Joan Van Ark, is a fictional {{character in the}} CBS primetime soap opera Knots Landing, a spin-off from the long-running series Dallas, in which she also appeared. The character originated on Dallas in 1978 {{as the mother of}} Lucy Ewing and ex-wife of Gary Ewing (the second son of oil baron Jock and Miss Ellie Ewing). Van Ark made several guest appearances on Dallas before becoming one of the main stars of the spin-off Knots Landing in December 1979, though she continued to make small appearances in Dallas for the next several years. Van Ark played Valene <b>in</b> <b>Knots</b> Landing for thirteen of its fourteen seasons, which made her one of the show's longest running stars. The character made her last Knots Landing appearance in 1997, when she appeared in the reunion miniseries [...] In 2013, Van Ark reprised her character for the new, updated version of Dallas.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, this {{rule of thumb}} came into being, {{developed}} by R. H. Kraft. [...] It was noted from rainfall amounts (in imperial units) reported by the first order rainfall network in the United States that the storm total rainfall fit a simple equation: [...] 100 divided by the speed of motion <b>in</b> <b>knots.</b> [...] This rule works, even in other countries, {{as long as a}} tropical cyclone is moving and only the first order or synoptic station network (with observations spaced about [...] apart) are used to derive storm totals. [...] Canada uses {{a modified version of the}} Kraft rule which divides the results by a factor of two, which takes into account the lower sea surface temperatures seen around Atlantic Canada and the prevalence of systems undergoing vertical wind shear at their northerly latitudes. [...] The main problem with this rule is that the rainfall observing network is denser than either the synoptic reporting network or the first order station networks, which means the absolute maximum is likely to be underestimated. [...] Another problem is that it does not take the size of the tropical cyclone or topography into account.|$|E

When she and Jeff divorce, Abby moves to San Diego. [...] On {{the way she}} stops to visit her brother, Sid, and decides to stay <b>in</b> <b>Knots</b> Landing. She rents a house on Seaview Circle, and has an affair with Richard Avery. [...] Abby soon sets her eyes on {{neighbor}} Gary Ewing, which becomes obvious after she starts working as a bookkeeper for Knots Landing Motors. She and Gary get the company involved with the mob, which results in her brother Sid's death. At the same time, Jeff kidnaps her children. She eventually gets them back. Abby and Gary go into a methanol business together and start an affair. Valene finds out and kicks Gary out, so he moves in with Abby. Gary soon inherits millions from his father Jock Ewing's death. Abby uses the money to manipulate those around her, and Gary starts drinking again. Gary sobers up and buys a ranch, similar to Southfork, the ranch his family owns. They move there and marry.|$|E
500|$|In the {{scientific}} world, {{several of his}} descriptive passages generated excitement and curiosity. [...] In early 1914, he had been surveying {{a portion of the}} international boundary in the Upper Waria River between the German and British protectorates. [...] By late September, he had passed into a different portion of the highlands, where the clay-slate mountains changed into limestone highlands. [...] In this geologic transition, he said, he also found a change in the ethnographic character of the population, whom he described as a [...] "new" [...] people. [...] They were stocky, powerfully built, and long–limbed; they wore their hair <b>in</b> <b>knots</b> on the centre of their heads, which were otherwise shaven, and painted yellow and black lines across their chests. They also wore grass skirts, so he called them the skirted ones. They used bows and arrows, slings and stone axes. As he pushed west to Mount Joseph, Detzner claimed, he had found the southern hills of the central watershed cut by numerous rivers flowing north to south. He had surmised that there were no insurmountable obstacles between him and the Sepik river. In 1917, he had travelled through the Ramu valley into the Bismarck range, northwest of the Kratke Mountains, and had continued on that route for [...] He also described the presence of an indigenous variation of German, called Unserdeutsch (our German), in several New Guinean dialects.|$|E
500|$|After their remarriage, Valene and Gary Ewing move to Knots Landing, {{a coastal}} suburb of Los Angeles, California. Valene is {{initially}} {{skeptical of the}} move, and describes Knots Landing as [...] "no place to start over". She is struck by her neighbors, the Fairgates, and particularly by Sid's daughter, Annie, from Sid's first marriage, who reminds Val of her own daughter, Lucy. Gary is determined to stay and convinces Val to give Knots Landing a chance. Val becomes involved in Jimmy Carter's 1980 re-election effort, joining the {{local chapter of the}} Carter-Mondale '80 campaign. She also signs up neighbor Karen Fairgate (Michele Lee) and the pair eventually become best friends, a relationship struck when Annie, on the run, turns to Val for help, and Val convinces her to return to her father and stepmother. Val remained a central character on the show from 1979 to 1992. Gary and Val's daughter, Lucy, visits her parents <b>in</b> <b>Knots</b> Landing and appears in one episode in the show's first season. Though largely uneducated, Valene discovers she has a talent for writing and writes a thinly veiled expose of the Ewings of Dallas called [...] "Capricorn Crude". Gary is extremely critical of the book, which affects their marriage. However, the book is published and Val becomes a best-selling novelist and financially independent. Val leaves Gary after Gary's affair with his neighbor and business partner, Abby Cunningham (Donna Mills); and Val keeps the house in Seaview Circle. Gary and Val's second marriage ended in divorce nearly a year later. Val is subsequently married to Ben Gibson (Doug Sheehan) (1985-1987), and later briefly to Danny Waleska (Sam Behrens) (1990).|$|E

500|$|Ledbury found Ohio with Penn {{standing}} by Dorset and Bramham dropping depth charges. The {{remnants of the}} convoy were about ten miles away, under attack from the air. Just as Captain Hill suggested to Penn to take Ohio in tow, Ledbury received a signal from the Convoy Commander to stand by Manchester in the Gulf of Hammamet. In view of the delay in signals, and as Penn and Bramham were {{standing by}} these two ships, Ledbury proceeded at [...] to look for Manchester, which according to the signal given by S.O. Cruiser Force had a flooded engine room and was ablaze. As the destroyer searched for the missing ship, it had passed alongside the wreckage of Almeria Lykes, and it had also shot down two three-engined Savoia-Marchetti bombers. After making landfall and identifying a headland as Ras-Mahmur, course was set to follow the coastline looking for Manchester. When the destroyer was almost certain that Manchester {{was not in the}} bay, the coast was closed in case there might be any survivors on the beach. At this moment, the signal station at Neboel started calling up [...] "VHM - VHA" [...] but Ledbury did not reply. The signal station at Hammamet made a flag signal, [...] "show your signal letters". The destroyer hoisted an Italian group consisting of flag [...] " [...] I [...] " [...] and three other flags tied <b>in</b> <b>knots</b> so as to be unreadable. This apparently satisfied the shore station as they hoisted a large French ensign. During this period Ledbury was showing no ensign and no Italian ensign was carried on board. The destroyer carried on down the coast until it was twelve miles (19km) south of Hammamet. During this time there were enemy reports of a cruiser near Zembra and also that two destroyers were making for Pantelleria.The destroyer changed course to pass five miles south of Linosa, and she altered the course after dark in order to rejoin Ohio.|$|E
