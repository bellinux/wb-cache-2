During an interview with CNN, Psy stated that [...] "the night before the music video shoot, I was watching Korea's Got Talent and saw him dance to Michael Jackson. His moves were ridiculous.

500|$|The rating did {{not come}} without its share of controversy. Reginald Dennis {{described}} to the reaction that followed Minya Oh's review: [...] "I was happy, Jon was happy, Nas was happy, everybody was happy — except {{for all of the}} people who felt that The Chronic should have also gotten a 5." [...] Only two years prior, Dr. Dre's groundbreaking The Chronic failed to earn the coveted rating, despite redefining the musical landscape of hip hop. It was later revealed that while everybody at the magazine knew it was an instant classic, they decided to comply with the strict policy of staying away from a perfect rating. Subsequently, when Nas's album was exempted from this moratorium, many fans pointed to this decision as a confirmation of journalistic bias towards East Coast hip hop. Despite receiving criticism over his staff's earlier review of The Chronic, Reginald Dennis continues to defend the decision to award Illmatic with the magazine's highest rating: [...] "I’m just happy that Illmatic is universally acclaimed as a classic, so no one can accuse me of dropping the ball... And if I hadn’t gone through what I did with The Chronic, I wouldn’t have had the flexibility to allow for the bending of my policy. So I think <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>worked</b> out well.” ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{producer}} Steve Tisch saw a 60 Minutes {{segment on}} Harduvel's legal fight, after {{working with her}} on a proposal, he pitched the film to Disney, originally titled, [...] "The Janet Harduvel Story." [...] At {{the height of the}} Gulf War, the feature was in pre-production when Disney reassessed the optics of releasing an anti-military film, and backed out. HBO quickly picked up the project, but only offered a fraction of the original budget of $14 million. Tisch said, [...] "HBO said they wanted to make the movie, but I would have less than $5 million to make it. It was exactly the same movie, but <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>worked</b> out." [...] Janet Harduvel appeared in an uncredited cameo role, and acted as a creative consultant on the film. Although Harduvel's real-life attorney, the aviation specialist Myron Pappadakis was changed into the fictional Leo Morrone, her sister, Marybeth was the basis for the film's Mary Sciales.|$|E
2500|$|Collider.com's Kayti Burt {{felt the}} episode of Arrow [...] "gets enough nostalgic hits {{in to make}} it work, while also giving us an {{exciting}} (batshit crazy) final act to launch us into the final part of the superhero crossover... Though the shared hallucination gimmick might lack long-term narrative consequence and feel like {{a bit of a}} 'Look, It's The 100th Episode!' plot device, it works because of the performance of all of the actors (including many returning ones) and the sentiment that this show has genuinely inspired in people." [...] Conversely, Burt [...] "was a bit sad that Arrow was robbed the opportunity of having a 100th episode outside of the already considerable demands of the crossover event, which were sometimes at odds with what this episode was trying to do... This episode was trying to do far too much and was therefore a bit of a mess, but it's hard to dislike an hour of TV that is earnestly trying to please its fans in so many different ways." [...] She gave the episode 3 stars out of 5. Sara Netzley, for Entertainment Weekly praised the episode, awarding it an [...] "A", saying [...] "Lots of Arrow action here, and not as much for The Flash/Supergirl folks to do. Still, <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>worked</b> beautifully. We get enough cross-team action to make it a treat for viewers of the Berlanti-verse while still forwarding the invasion story line – and honoring the characters, plots, and themes that have made Arrow such a satisfying show over the last four and a half seasons. It was a tall order, but the episode pulled it off." ...|$|E

60|$|After sunset R.C. and I {{went off}} down a trail into the woods, and sitting down under a huge spruce we listened. The forest was solemn and still.

The whole business at Woodhouse was finished. Manchester House and all the furniture was sold to some boot-and-shoe people: at least the boot-and-shoe people had the house. They had given four thousand pounds for it--which was above the lawyer's estimate.
