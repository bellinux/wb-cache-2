2500|$|The {{legal and}} {{regulatory}} status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation. Countries {{such as the}} United States, Canada, Lebanon and Egypt use substantial equivalence to determine if further testing is required, while many countries {{such as those in}} the European Union, Brazil and China only authorize GMO cultivation on a case-by-case basis. [...] In the U.S. the FDA determined that GMO's are [...] "Generally Recognized as Safe" [...] (GRAS) and therefore do not require additional testing if the <b>GMO</b> <b>product</b> is substantially equivalent to the non-modified product. [...] If new substances are found, further testing may be required to satisfy concerns over potential toxicity, allergenicity, possible gene transfer to humans or genetic outcrossing to other organisms.|$|E
40|$|There are two {{mechanisms}} by which modern genetically modified organism (GMO) products can affect productivity in developing countries. The first is the Genes for Rent mechanism where a recipient country agrees with a GMO company to incorporate a <b>GMO</b> <b>product</b> (e. g., a Bt gene in cotton varieties) and pay a technology fee. The second is the Transgenic Breeding mechanism in which National Agricultural Research System (NARS) breeders use modern biotech methods marker-aided breeding, genetic maps, and genomics research to produce GMO traits of economic value in crop varieties. The first mechanism requires little skill {{on the part of}} the recipient country (the GMO supplier will incorporate the gene into a number of varieties). But these GMO products are of little value in traditional crop varieties. Few countries have the Intellectual Property Rights or regulatory regimes at present to support this mechanism. The second mechanism is very demanding of skills by NARS breeders. Only a few NARS programs (notably China, India, Brazil, Argentina, and a few other countries) are investing in these skills. The promise of GMO-based productivity gains in developing countries is thus constrained. Only a few countries are positioned to pursue both mechanisms. ...|$|E

In a May 2014 article in The Economist it was argued that, while GM foods could potentially help feed 842 million malnourished people globally, laws {{such as the one}} passed in Vermont, to require labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients, could have the unintended consequence of interrupting the process of spreading GM technologies to impoverished countries that suffer with food security problems.|$|R
5000|$|In the U.S., the {{political}} debate has centered primarily {{on whether or not}} to label <b>products</b> with <b>GMO</b> origins to better inform the public about the content of the foods they purchase. A statewide ballot question that would have mandated labeling of <b>GMO</b> <b>products</b> in California was defeated in 2012. The measure, known as Proposition 37 was leading by a wide margin in early polling [...] but was defeated after an advertising blitz bankrolled by Monsanto, the largest supplier of genetically engineered seeds, Kraft Foods, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo., and other large food business interests. The ballot question's results were closely watched across the country as advocates for the measure hoped that it would pass and spur the federal government to mandate labeling of GMO foods as well. [...] In the wake of the labeling law proposal's defeat, an organization called March Against Monsanto was formed to continue to keep alive the public debate about labeling <b>GMO</b> food <b>products.</b> In 2013, a ballot initiative that would have required labels on GMO foods sold in the state of Washington was defeated by voters, again after a campaign against the initiative was led by major food companies.|$|R

5000|$|One of the {{key issues}} {{concerning}} regulators is whether GM products should be labeled. The European Commission says that mandatory labeling and traceability are needed to allow for informed choice, avoid potential False advertising and facilitate the withdrawal of products if adverse effects on health or the environment are discovered. [...] The American Medical Association and the American Association for the Advancement of Science say that absent scientific evidence of harm even voluntary labeling is misleading and will falsely alarm consumers". Labeling of <b>GMO</b> <b>products</b> in the marketplace is required in 64 countries. [...] Labeling can be mandatory up to a threshold GM content level (which varies between countries) or voluntary. In Canada and the USA labeling of GM food is voluntary, while in Europe all food (including processed food) or feed which contains greater than 0.9% of approved GMOs must be labelled.|$|R

Two GM-maize, including theBT 11 and GA 21 lines of maize (Zea mays L.), and one plant, namely NK 11 as the nontransgenic control, were used as plantgenetic materials in the event-specific detection of maize. The target gene from each sample was amplified in different reaction(simplex) using both the event specific primer and the endogenous maize reference, Zein, as internal control. Furthermore, induplex PCR, two targets were simultaneously amplified in the same reaction. The results showed that detection method of theGM product obtained from present study enabled us to screen the GM products and specifically the event of BT 11 and GA 21 using simplex and duplex methods.
