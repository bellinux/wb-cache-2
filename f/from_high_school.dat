The Illinois Education Reform Act of 1985 required all public school districts to implement teacher evaluation practices, teacher performance rating practices, and staff development practices. This study examined the perceptions of 142 <b>high</b> <b>school</b> principals and 645 teachers of these required practices and school climate measures. Teachers' participation in formative feedback programs in their respective <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> and school size were independent variables. A survey instrument was used to collect data and the results were analyzed for statistical significance. Principals' and teachers' perceptions of teacher evaluation practices, teacher performance rating practices, staff development practices, and school climate measures were significantly different. Principals' responses indicated a greater degree of implementation of the practices than did the teachers' responses. Perceptions of teachers <b>from</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> with formative feedback programs were significantly different from perceptions of other teachers. Teachers in formative feedback programs indicated a greater degree of implementation of the practices than did teachers <b>from</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> without formative feedback programs. Perceptions of teachers <b>from</b> large <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> with formative feedback programs were significantly different from perceptions of other teachers <b>from</b> large <b>high</b> <b>schools.</b> Teachers in large <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> with formative feedback programs indicated a greater degree of implementation of the practices than did teachers <b>from</b> large <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> without formative feedback programs.

This mixed method study examined student perceptions of school climate, psychological sense of community (PSOC), and Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs) in U.
