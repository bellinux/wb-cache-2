Quantity of these methods depends on adequacy level of created mathematical model to real physical process. In this article questions of design adequacy mathematical model of deforming process of special <b>device</b> <b>body</b> under inner pressure of home-made bomb explosion are discussed. Mathematical model adequacy is controlled by comparison modeling and experimental results. Computer program "ANSYS/LS-DYNA" was used for mathematical researching. Because of mathematical model have to consist as gas part (detonation product, air) as metal part (defuse home-made explosive bombs devise body) {{it was based on}} Lagrange-Euler method of describing behavior of different materials under shock. Expansion of detonation products was described by JWL equation of state.

Conclusions: Mode of deformation definition method of defuse home-made explosive bombs devise was created. That method bases on adequacy mathematical model which describes home-made bomb explosion process which places inside of devise align.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the overshoot effect of switch-on transients of polycrystalline silicon thin-film transistors. The investigation has been performed with devices fabricated on laterally grown polycrystalline silicon films having very long crystal domains. These films were crystallized by excimer-laser annealing and had a thickness {{in the range of}} 30 - 100 nm. The measurement of the switch-on transients reveals that the device transient behavior depends significantly on both temperature and illumination conditions. The temperature dependence, under dark state or under illumination, suggests that the mechanism accountable for the transient behavior of thin-film transistors cannot be attributed only to carrier trapping, but rather to a more complex mechanism involving carrier generation and recombination in the <b>device</b> <b>body.</b> This allows the estimation of the dependence of generation lifetime on the polycrystalline film thickness.

40|$|We use {{molecular}} dynamics (MD) simulation techniques {{to study the}} regrowth of nanometric multigate Si devices, such as fins and nanowires, surrounded by free surfaces and interfaces with amorphous material. Our results indicate that atoms in amorphous regions close to lateral free surfaces or interfaces rearrange at a slower rate compared to those in bulk due to the discontinuity of the lateral crystalline template. Consequently, the recrystallization front which advances faster in the device center than at the interfaces adopts new orientations. Regrowth then proceeds depending on the particular orientation of the new amorphous/crystal interfaces. In the particular case of (110) oriented fins, the new amorphous/crystal interfaces are aligned along the (111) direction, which produces frequent twining during further regrowth. Based on our simulation results, we propose alternatives to overcome this defected recrystallization in multigate structures: device orientation along (100) to prevent the formation of limiting { 111 } I amorphous/crystal interfaces and presence of a crystalline seed along the <b>device</b> <b>body</b> to favor regrowth perpendicular to the lateral surfaces/interfaces rather than parallel to them.
