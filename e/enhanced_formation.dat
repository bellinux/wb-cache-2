25|$|In 1969, Colonel O.B. Philp, Base Commander of CFB Moose Jaw {{and former}} {{leader of the}} defunct Golden Centennaires {{aerobatic}} team, considered using several of the leftover Golden Centennaire CT-114 Tutor aircraft for another team. These Tutors were still fitted for aerobatic flying and because of some minor corrosion, had been painted with white anti-corrosive paint. Philp, at this point, did not receive approval to form the new team; however, approval had been given for single Tutors to provide simple flypasts at local pro football games. To further the cause of an aerobatic team, Philp began informal <b>enhanced</b> <b>formation</b> practice for the instructors at 2 Canadian Forces Flying Training School {{with the aim of}} providing multi-aircraft flypasts at special events. In 1970, four-aircraft formations began providing flypasts at fairs and festivals, as well as Armed Forces Day at CFB Moose Jaw. In July 1970, a white Tutor was introduced to the formation for flypasts. Four white Tutors were finally flown together at the Abbotsford Air Show, followed by a flypast in Winnipeg. Known as the 2 Canadian Forces Flying Training School Formation Team, or informally as the Tutor Whites, the team grew in size to seven aircraft in 1971 using eleven pilots, and gradually gained recognition. Formation flypasts were replaced with more complicated manoeuvres, and more aircraft were added as the team matured.|$|E

40|$|The {{understanding}} of melanoma malignancy mechanisms {{is essential for}} patient survival, because melanoma is responsible for ca. 75 % of deaths related to skin cancers. <b>Enhanced</b> <b>formation</b> of invadopodia and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation are two important drivers of cell invasion, and actin dynamics facilitate protrusive activity by providing a driving force to push through the ECM. We focused {{on the influence of}} epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) on melanoma cell invasiveness, since they are observed in the melanoma microenvironment. All three factors stimulated invasion of A 375 and WM 1341 D cells derived from primary tumor sites. In contrast, only EGF and HGF stimulated invasion of WM 9 and Hs 294 T cells isolated from lymph node metastases. <b>Enhanced</b> <b>formation</b> of invadopodia and ECM degradation underlie the increased amount of invasive cells after stimulation with the tested agents. Generally, a rise in invasive potential was accompanied by a decrease in actin polymerization state (F:G ratio).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Arsenite (iAsIII) {{can promote}} {{mutagenicity}} and carcinogenicity of other carcinogens. Considerable attention {{has focused on}} interference with DNA repair by inorganic arsenic, especially the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, whereas less {{is known about the}} effect of arsenic on the induction of DNA damage by other agents. OBJECTIVES: We examined how arsenic modulates DNA damage by other chemicals. METHODS: We used an NER-deficient cell line to dissect DNA damage induction from DNA repair and {{to examine the effects of}} iAsIII on the formation of benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) –DNA adducts. RESULTS: We found that pretreatment with iAsIII at subtoxic concentrations (10 µM) led to <b>enhanced</b> <b>formation</b> of BPDE–DNA adducts. Reduced glutathione levels, glutathione S-transferase activity and chromatin accessibility were also measured after iAsIII treatment, but none of these factors appeared to account for the <b>enhanced</b> <b>formation</b> of DNA adducts. However, we found that pretreatment with iAsIII increased the cellular uptake of BPDE in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that iAsIII enhanced the formation of BPDE–DNA adducts by increasing the cellular uptake of BPDE. Therefore, the ability of arsenic to increase the bioavailability of other carcinogens may contribute to arsenic co-carcinogenicity.

40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is {{the second}} most common {{neurodegenerative}} disease, affecting six million people worldwide. PD results from the specific loss of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons. Aggregation of one protein, α-synuclein, is characteristic of PD. This aggregation is thought to be a critical step in the etiology of the disease. While the molecular mechanism of α-synuclein aggregation remains unknown, nitrative stress and phosphorylation have been implicated in α-synuclein modification and aggregation. In fact, nitration of α-synuclein tyrosine residues 39, 125, 133 or 136, may be an early event in aggregates, Lewy bodies, seen in PD. Furthermore, nitrative stress leads to the induction of α-synuclein aggregation at a higher rate than seen in other PD mutants. This aggregation may result from a stabilization of pre-assembled α-synuclein filaments, which, upon nitration, may withstand denaturing conditions and <b>enhance</b> <b>formation</b> of SDS-insoluble, heat-stable high mass aggregates. Phosphorylation of a-synuclein also appears to {{play a critical role in}} the formation of aggregates. Extensive studies indicate that α-synuclein found in PD patient brains is extensively phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of ser- 129 may <b>enhance</b> <b>formation</b> of aggregates reminiscent of Lewy bodies in vitro and in vivo. Nitration and phosphorylation of α-synuclein may be key to the mechanisms underlying the formation of Lewy bodies in PD...|$|R
40|$|An <b>enhanced</b> <b>formation</b> of {{nitric oxide}} (NO), {{due to the}} {{induction}} of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), has been implicated in the pathogenesis of shock and inflammation, but its role in acute pancreatitis still remains controversial. To clarify the role of NO in acute pancreatitis, the present experiment investigated the expression of iNOS {{and the effect of}} NOS inhibition on cerulein-induced pancreatitis in rats. Group I received intraperitoneal (ip) injection of normal saline. Group II received two ip injections of cerulein (20 g/kg). Group III received injections of N G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (30 mg/kg) with cerulein. Group IV received L-arginine (250 mg/kg) with cerulein and L-NAME. The expression of iNOS in the pancreas was examined by western blot analysis. The plasma concentration of NO metabolites was measured. The severity of pancreatitis was assessed by measuring serum amylase, pancreas water content and histopathological examination. Compared with controls, the cerulein group displayed significantly increased expression of iNOS and raised plasma NO metabolites. Treatment with L-NAME significantly decreased hyperamylasemia, plasma NO level, and the extent of pancreatic injury. Treatment with L-arginine reversed the effects of L-NAME. These findings suggest that an <b>enhanced</b> <b>formation</b> of NO by iNOS {{plays an important role in}} the development of acute pancreatitis, and inhibition of NO production has the beneficial effects in reducing pancreas injury...|$|E
40|$|Endotoxaemia causes an <b>enhanced</b> <b>formation</b> of {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} (ROS) which contribute to the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in septic shock. Here we investigate (i) the effects of endotoxin on the expression of two isoforms of superoxide dismutase (SOD), namely Cu/Zn-SOD (cytosol) and Mn-SOD (mitochondria) in the rat kidney, and (ii) {{the effects of the}} radical scavenger tempol on the MODS caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, E. coli, 6 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. v.) in the rat. Endotoxaemia resulted in a rapid, but transient, decline in the expression of both mRNA and protein of Cu/Zn-SOD as well as an increase in the expression of the mRNA of Mn-SOD in the kidney. Endotoxaemia for 6 [*]h also caused hypotension, acute renal dysfunction, hepatocellular injury, pancreatic injury and an increase in the plasma levels of nitrite/nitrate. Pretreatment of rats with tempol (100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. v. bolus injection, 15 [*]min prior to LPS followed by an infusion of 30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. v., n= 9) did not affect the circulatory failure, but attenuated the renal dysfunction and the hepatocellular injury/dysfunction caused by LPS. Tempol did not affect the rise in nitrite/nitrate caused by endotoxin. These results imply that an <b>enhanced</b> <b>formation</b> of ROS (including superoxide anions) in conjunction with inadequate defences against such ROS contributes to the injury and dysfunction of the kidney and the liver in endotoxic shock...|$|E
