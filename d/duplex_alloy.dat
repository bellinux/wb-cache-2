40|$|The {{deformation}} mechanisms {{responsible for}} the creep behaviour of two TiAl alloys with duplex and lamellar structures have been analysed after carrying out microstructural observations {{as a function of}} creep strain and applied stress at 700 °C. The <b>duplex</b> <b>alloy</b> exhibits extensive mechanical twinning and the new twin interfaces subdivide the γ grains throughout the primary stage of creep. At the onset of the minimum creep rate, the twin interfaces in the <b>duplex</b> <b>alloy</b> behave {{in the same way as}} the or the interfaces in the lamellar alloy. Thus, dislocation accumulation and emission from the interfaces occur under the action of the high local stresses. The high stress exponent, n = 19, measured in both alloys at the minimum strain rate has been interpreted in terms of a threshold stress representing the high local stresses required to liberate dislocations from the interfaces and initiate their propagation within the γ matrix.

In addition, the grain-orientation-dependent elastic/plastic anisotropy in each phase may cause grain-to-grain interactions, which further modify the microscopic load partitioning between phases. In the current work, neutron diffraction experiments on the spectrometer for materials research at temperature and stress (SMARTS) were performed on an austenite-ferrite stainless steel for tracing the evolution of various microstresses during tensile loading, with particular emphasis on the load sharing among grains with different crystallographic orientations. The anisotropic elastic/plastic properties of the duplex steel were simulated using a visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) model that can predict the phase stress and the grain-orientation-dependent stress.

Fatigue tests were conducted at 600 °C using computer-controlled servohydraulic loading at a frequency of 20 Hz. Reasonably good agreement was achieved between the fatigue data and calculated fatigue strength based on the fatigue threshold and measured impact severity.

However, a comparison of fatigue threshold approximations based on a through-thickness crack geometry and a corner-crack geometry suggests that these two models may represent the upper and lower bounds of the actual fatigue behavior.

SEM examinations revealed microstructural modifications induced by the Cr rich precipitates along the δ/γ and δ/δ grain boundaries, which may significantly affect the toughness and the corrosion resistance of the alloy. Solution annealing at 1100 °C led to complete dissolution of σ (Cr-Fe) phase, the microstructure being formed of primary δ-Fe and γ-Fe.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the study of cavitation behaviour of two-phase superplastic alloys, using mainly a hot microhardness technique. Cavitation is a serious problem in copper and iron base alloys, it drastically limits the elongation to failure and may affect the service properties of superplastically formed components. There is some empirical evidence to suggest that, for cavitation to occur, the two phases involved must be 'incompatible' that is, they show marked differences in certain properties. Ideally, this phenomenon would be investigated directly by an in-situ study of the deformation behaviour of each phase separately in the microduplex alloy at the superplastic temperature and hence pinpointing the phase incompatibilities, but existing techniques do not allow for this. Here, a hot microhardness tester was commissioned and used to determine the hardness and activation energy of each phase in-situ in a <b>duplex</b> <b>alloy</b> in thc superplastic temperature range. Zn/Al eutectoid and 60 / 40 brass were here used as models to represent a non-cavitating and cavitating class of superplastic alloys. In addition, a series of alloys were produced of compositions corresponding to those of the individual phases in these systems over a supcrplastic temperature range. These alloys were hot tensile. tested to find the ductility and ten'fle strength of each phase of superplastic alloy. The hot hardness data was correlated with the hot tensile data for the alloys over the whole temperature range from 0. 4 to 0. 84 Tm. Variation of Young's modulus with temperature was determined by a vibration technique and activation energy calculated form LnH versus Tm plots for all the alloys. In 60; 40 brass, the amount E of -T cavitation decreased with an increase in temperatur% and this alloy gave a maximum elongation of ti 110 pct at 250 °C 1, 0. 45 Trrj, but it still exhibited extensive cavitation. In the Zn/Al eutectoid, no cavitation was observed apart from that associated with a few large inclusions. The hardness values of the two phases in a/ß brass were very different at the superplastic temperature, as were the load extension curves from the tensile tests and the calculated activation energies. In. the Zn/Al eutectoid however, the mechanical properties of the two phases were similar, though the activation energies were different. Finally, an attempt was made to explain the occurrence of cavitation in Supral 150 and certain steels, in some cases experimentally and in others from data available in the literature...|$|E

A mechanism of deaeration and acidification is thought to produce locally aggressive conditions within the crevice. A variety of experimental techniques were therefore used to investigate the crevice corrosion resistance of some commercial duplex {{stainless steels}} in seawater and other, more aggressive Cr-containing environments. The established marine grade 316 L austenitic stainless steel was used for reference purposes. The investigations provided both quantitative data regarding alloy performance, and qualitative observations regarding the attack mechanism. The crevice corrosion resistance of the duplex stainless steels was shown to be superior to that of 316 L, and to increase with (Cr + N) content. Electrochemical polarisation scans demonstrated the importance of dissolved 02 in the seawater in maintaining a protective passive film on these alloys. Active peak current density, {{a measure of the}} severity of attack, was shown to increase with decreasing pH. In a simulated crevice solution, the <b>duplex</b> <b>alloys</b> were shown to exhibit both a narrower active range and lower peak current density than 316 L.

The technique suggested that cathodic protection potentials as noble as - 600 mV (SCE) may be sufficient to protect duplex stainless steels in seawater. Metallographic observation and electron beam analysis showed that the attack mode is potential dependent, with ferrite and austenite preferentially attacked at more active and noble potentials respectively. Real time tests showed that the internal crevice pH of austenitic stainless steel could fall to as low as 1. 3.

40|$|In {{comparison}} to conventional duplex stainless steels (DSS), lean duplex SS {{are characterized by}} restricted nickel and molybdenum contents and by incremented manganese and nitrogen percentages, added to stabilize the austenitic phase.

It has been proved that surface modification of biomaterials with Ag or Cu has evolved as a potentially effective method for preventing bacterial proliferation on the devices surfaces.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop multi-functional stainless steel surfaces which combine greatly improved wear resistance, at least maintain corrosion resistance and provide long-lasting, high efficacy, antimicrobial effects. In this thesis a series of surface engineering technologies, including active screen co-alloying, active screen plasma <b>duplex</b> <b>alloying</b> and double glow plus active screen <b>duplex</b> plasma <b>alloying,</b> were developed for surface alloying stainless steel with Ag or Cu and N; the phase constitution, microstructure, composition, and surface roughness of the alloyed surfaces were fully characterized, and the surface hardness, wear resistance, bonding strength, antimicrobial efficiency and corrosion behaviour of the treated surfaces were evaluated. In addition, further inspection of the wear mechanisms and corrosion mechanisms were conducted on post-exposure surfaces. It was found that the adhesive wear mechanism of austenite can be reduced by this alloying combination and the wear resistance was improved by up to 1000 times, and the Ag/Cu alloyed surface was bactericidal and growth-inhibitive for many pathogens including E. coli NCTC 10418 and S. epidermidis NCTC 11047 effectively up to 99 %/ 6 h. The mechanism of bactericidal efficiency of Ag/Cu is found dependent on the structure of the bacterial membrane and a higher efficiency of antibacterial agents is found associated with the higher elemental concentration of copper and silver. With regard to corrosion, it is affected largely by the configuration of surface structure and several corrosion mechanisms were evolved.

The material‟s wide applications in chemical, petrochemical, off-shore, and power generation plants prove that it {{is one of}} the most reliable materials. The Newest fast growing family of stainless steels is <b>duplex</b> <b>alloys.</b> The ferritic-austenitic grades have a ferrite matrix intermix with austenite and in other words island of austenite in a continuous matrix of highly alloyed ferrite commonly called „Duplex‟ stainless steel. Duplex stainless steel covers ferritic/austenitic Fe-Cr-Ni alloy with between 30 % to 70 % Ferrite. Due to high level of Cr, Mo, and N steels shows high pitting & stress corrosion cracking resistance in chloride-containing environments. Hence it is frequently used in oilrefinery heat exchangers & typical applications where there is a risk for SCC and localized corrosion as a result of chloride-containing process streams, cooling waters or deposits. Modern duplex stainless steels have generally good Weldability. Due to a balanced composition, where nitrogen plays an important role, austenite formation in the heat affected zone (HAZ) and weld metal is rapid. Under normal welding conditions a sufficient amount of austenite is formed to maintain good resistance to localized corrosion where as too rapid cooling may result in excessive amounts of ferrite, reducing the toughness. Therefore, welding with low heat input in thick walled materials should be avoided. Welding methods, such as resistance welding, laser welding and electron beam welding, which cause extremely rapid cooling should also be avoided or used with extreme caution.

Design/methodology/approach: The duplex compositions have been obtained using austenitic AISI 316 L and AISI 410 L as starting base powders. While AISI 316 L stainless steel samples have been manufactured using different combinations of compacting pressure and sintering parameters, or a modified composition able to allow reactive sintering process, as well as the contact infiltration with bronze. Findings: The studies have been forwarded towards the static and dynamic mechanical properties, as well as the corrosion behavior. Lowering the porosity level and increasing the sintering degree, by use of higher compacting pressure or sintering temperature, is of great effectiveness, especially from the point of view of mechanical properties. Moreover, the innovative duplex composition are very promising.

As-received and 10 % cold rolled samples (with two orientations transverse and longitudinal to the loading direction) were subjected to an applied strain of 0. 03 under displacement controlled tests. Regular optical observations were recorded of the droplets and their surrounding area. DIC analyses used the differentiation of the displacement fields to obtain the apparent surface strains used to detect crack initiation and propagation, and to measure crack opening displacements. It was found that DIC was efficiently observed the strain developments and the displacements in observed surfaces outside of the droplets but it could not identify or quantify the initiation of the cracks inside the droplets because of the mobility of the salt film and the high amount of the corrosion products formed which obscure the vision under the droplets. In addition, results showed that early stage microcracks were initiated in α phase and α/γ interfaces and propagated preferentially in the ferrite phase. Also, SCC initiation and propagation was accelerated by cold rolling and the grains orientations were of major effects on the retardation of crack propagation which was more severe in the transverse rolling direction.

On the contrary, the presence of Nb-enriched phase such as Nb 2 Al would decrease the oxidation resistance at elevated temperature due to the formation of Nb 2 O 5, which would accelerate the exfoliation of oxide...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{equiaxed}} superfine/nanocrystalline <b>duplex</b> PM-TiAl-based <b>alloy</b> with (γ + α 2) microstructure, Ti- 45 Al- 5 Nb (at %), {{has been}} synthesized by high-energy ball milling and vacuum hot pressing sintering. Superplastic deformation behavior {{has been investigated}} at 1000 °C and 1050 °C with strain rates from 5 × 10 − 5 s− 1 to 1 × 10 − 3 s− 1. The effects of deformation on the microstructure and mechanical behaviors of high Nb containing TiAl alloy have been characterized and analyzed. The results showed that, the ultimate tensile strength of the alloy was 58. 7 MPa at 1000 °C and 10. 5 MPa at 1050 °C with a strain rate of 5 × 10 − 5 s− 1, while the elongation was 121 % and 233 %, respectively. The alloy exhibited superplastic elongation at 1000 and 1050 °C with an exponent (m) of 0. 48 and 0. 45. The main softening mechanism was dynamic recrystallization of γ grains; the dislocation slip and γ/γ interface twinning were responsible for superplastic deformation. The orientation relationship of γ/γ interface twinning obeyed the classical one: (001) γ//(110) γ...|$|R
40|$|Grain {{boundary}} (GB) segregation can markedly {{improve the}} stability of nanostructured alloys, where the fraction of GB sites is inherently large. Here, we explore the concept of entropically supported GB segregation in alloys with a tendency to phase-separate {{and its role in}} stabilizing nanostructures therein. These <b>duplex</b> nanocrystalline <b>alloys</b> are notably different, both in a structural and thermodynamic sense, from the previously studied “classical” nanocrystalline alloys, which are solid solutions with GB segregation of solute. Experiments are conducted on the W–Cr system, in which nanoduplex structures are expected. Upon heating ball-milled W– 15 at. % Cr up to 950 °C, a nanoscale Cr-rich phase was found along the GBs. These precipitates mostly dissolved into the W-rich grains leaving behind Cr-enriched GBs upon further heating to 1400 °C. The presence of Cr-rich nanoprecipitates and GB segregation of Cr is in line with prediction from our Monte Carlo simulation when GB states are incorporated into the alloy thermodynamics.

40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels {{can be very}} attractive alternatives to austenitic grades due to their almost double strength at equal pitting corrosion resistance. When welding, the <b>duplex</b> <b>alloys</b> normally require addition of filler metal, while the commodity austenitic grades can often be welded autogenously. Over-alloyed consumables are used to counteract segregation of important alloying elements and to balance the two phases, ferrite and austenite, in the duplex weld metal. This work focuses on the weldability of the recently-developed lean duplex stainless steel LDX 2101 ® (EN 1. 4162, UNS S 32101). The pitting corrosion resistance of this grade is better than that of austenitic AISI 304 (EN 1. 4307) and can reach the level of AISI 316 L (EN 1. 4404). The austenite formation is rapid in LDX 2101 compared to older duplex grades. Pitting resistance tests performed show that 1 - 2. 5 mm thick laser and gas tungsten arc (GTA) welded LDX 2101 can have good corrosion properties even when welding autogenously. Additions of filler metal, nitrogen in the shielding gas, nitrogen-based backing gas and use of laser hybrid welding methods, however, increase the austenite formation. The pitting resistance may also be increased by suppressing formation of chromium nitrides in the weld metal and heat affected zone (HAZ). After thorough post-weld cleaning (pickling), pitting primarily occurred 1 - 3 mm from the fusion line, in the parent metal {{rather than in the}} HAZ. Neither the chromium nitride precipitates found in the HAZ, nor the element depletion along the fusion line that was revealed by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) were found to locally decrease the pitting resistance. The preferential pitting location is suggested to be controlled by the residual weld oxide composition that varies over the surface. The composition and thickness of weld oxide formed on LDX 2101 and 2304 (EN 1. 4362, UNS S 32304) were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The heat tint on these lean duplex grades proved to contain significantly more manganese than what has been reported for standard austenitic {{stainless steels}} in the AISI 300 series. A new approach to heat tint formation is presented; whereby evaporation of material from the weld metal and subsequent deposition on the already-formed weld oxide are suggested to contribute to weld oxide formation. This is consistent with manganese loss from the weld metal, and nitrogen additions to the GTA shielding gas enhance the evaporation. The segregation of all elements apart from nitrogen is low in autogenously welded LDX 2101. This means that filler wire additions may not be required as for other duplex grades assuming that there is no large nitrogen loss that could cause excessive ferrite contents. As the nitrogen appears to be controlling the austenite formation, it becomes essential to avoid losing nitrogen during welding by choosing nitrogen-containing shielding and backing gas.

40|$|Light-weight {{magnesium}} alloys {{with high}} strength are especially desirable for the applications in transportation, aerospace, electronic components, and implants owing to their high stiffness, abundant raw materials, and environmental friendliness. Unfortunately, conventional strengthening methods mainly involve the formation of internal defects, in which particles and grain boundaries prohibit dislocation motion as well as compromise ductility invariably. Herein, we report a novel strategy for simultaneously achieving high specific yield strength (∼ 160 kN m kg– 1) and good elongation (∼ 23. 6 %) in a <b>duplex</b> magnesium <b>alloy</b> containing 8 wt % lithium at room temperature, based on the introduction of densely hierarchical { 101 ̅ 1 }–{ 101 ̅ 1 } double contraction nanotwins (DCTWs) and full-coherent hexagonal close-packed (hcp) particles in twin boundaries by ultrahigh pressure technique. These hierarchical nanoscaled DCTWs with stable interface characteristics not only bestow a large fraction of twin interface but also form interlaced continuous grids, hindering possible dislocation motions. Meanwhile, orderly aggregated particles offer supplemental pinning effect for overcoming latent softening roles of twin interface movement and detwinning process. The processes lead to a concomitant but unusual situation where double contraction twinning strengthens rather than weakens magnesium alloys. Those cutting-edge results provide underlying insights toward designing alternative and more innovative hcp-type structural materials with superior mechanical properties.

40|$|The {{multi-phase}} TiAl intermetallics for {{the application}} in aero-engine turbine blades have complex microstructures. The mechanical behaviour of these alloys is influenced by two major grain structures, namely, single phase -grains (TiAl) and two-phase ( 2 Ti 3 Al + TiAl) lamellar colonies. In the designing of components made of TiAl alloys the current approaches available in the integrated computational material engineering (ICME) lack advanced modelling strategies. For example, structural length scale for the complex material systems is often ignored or physics based constitutive behaviour of the alloy constituents is not considered. As an improvement we have developed a finite element based modelling approach that accounts for most important structural details covering a two-scale description of alloy microstructure (meso and micro) and incorporates a crystal plasticity constitutive model describing physics based deformation phenomena for prevailing phases. For the model input a series of experimental analyses using microscopy (TEM/REM) is required to generate representative microstructure data. Additional mechanical tests are needed for validating the model using global load-deformation responses. In the present work we will demonstrate the potentials of the modelling approach showing some predictive results for the deformation behaviour of a <b>duplex</b> TiAl <b>alloy</b> and discuss the sensitivity of microstructure on the overall alloy plasticity. It seems, the model is able to predict microstructure-property correlations of complex alloys up to reasonable accuracy. We expect to enhance the ICME based component design using this microstructure sensitive modelling approach...|$|R
