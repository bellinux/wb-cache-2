5|$|During the Pittsburgh Penguins {{run for the}} Stanley Cup {{multiple}} {{members of}} the Steelers showed support for the cross-town team. Ben Roethlisberger attended Stanley Cup Finals games in Detroit, where he and the Steelers won Super Bowl XL three years prior.

5|$|During the half-time {{break of}} Luton's 3–0 defeat {{away at his}} former club York on 24 September 2011, Lawless broke his hand after {{punching}} a wall out of frustration, resulting in him being ruled out for around a month and being handed a fine by his club. He played in Luton's 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final 2–1 defeat at Wembley, coincidentally against York, on 20 May 2012. Lawless signed a one-year contract extension in July 2012, despite poor performances during the 2011–12 season making him a target <b>for</b> <b>fans.</b>|$|E
5|$|Football kit {{has evolved}} {{significantly}} {{since the early}} days of the sport when players typically wore thick cotton shirts, knickerbockers and heavy rigid leather boots. In the twentieth century, boots became lighter and softer, shorts were worn at a shorter length, and advances in clothing manufacture and printing allowed shirts to be made in lighter synthetic fibres with increasingly colourful and complex designs. With the rise of advertising in the 20th century, sponsors' logos began to appear on shirts, and replica strips were made available <b>for</b> <b>fans</b> to purchase, generating significant amounts of revenue for clubs.|$|E

5|$|For 24-year-old Hanshin Tigers fan Masaya Shitababa, the 2003 celebration was a tragedy. He {{drowned in}} the canal, with all reports being {{that he had been}} shoved in by the revelers. To prevent future incidents, the Osaka city council ordered the {{construction}} of a new Ebisubashi bridge beginning in 2004, which will make it more difficult <b>for</b> <b>fans</b> to take the celebratory leap should the Curse of the Colonel be broken and the Tigers win again.|$|E
5|$|In April, Ødegaard {{was dropped}} from Castilla after {{a run of}} four defeats, with staff finding {{problems}} with him training with the first team while playing for the reserves, {{in addition to a}} language barrier. First team manager Carlo Ancelotti called <b>for</b> <b>fans</b> to be patient while Ødegaard settles in a new country. On 29 April, he was included in Real Madrid's matchday squad for the first time for a home La Liga fixture against UD Almería, as Ancelotti was without Gareth Bale, Luka Modrić and Karim Benzema through injury. However, he did not feature in the 3–0 victory.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} prior to the game, both teams {{had to cope with}} harsh winter weather in the Nashville area. Virginia Tech was forced to move {{practices}} indoors when an ice storm arrived on the day before Christmas. The storm caused travel delays <b>for</b> <b>fans</b> and players alike. Alabama's first practices in Nashville were held without the full team available because many players had been delayed. The harsh weather continued through the day of the game, and Tech was forced to cancel its final outdoor practice before the game. Alabama, meanwhile, drove 45 minutes to Murfreesboro to a practice field that was not covered by ice.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{supported}} clubs in Europe. The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200officially recognised Club of the LFC Official Supporters Clubs in at least 50 countries. Notable groups include Spirit of Shankly and Reclaim The Kop. The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Liverpool fans often refer to themselves as Kopites, a reference to the fans who once stood, and now sit, on the Kop at Anfield. In 2008 a group of fans decided to form a splinter club, A.F.C. Liverpool, to play matches <b>for</b> <b>fans</b> who had been priced out of watching Premier League football.|$|E
5|$|More than 10,000 {{retail stores}} in the United States held midnight launch parties for Halos release, in {{addition}} to other locations around the globe.

5|$|New York's 1988 season {{got off to}} a {{turbulent}} start due an offseason scandal involving Taylor. Taylor had abused cocaine, violating the NFL's substance abuse policy and was suspended for the first four games of the season. Taylor's over-the-edge lifestyle was becoming an increasing concern <b>for</b> <b>fans</b> and team officials. After his return, however, Taylor recorded 15.5 sacks in 12 games. The intense worry and scrutiny would prove to be for naught as {{for the rest of his}} career Taylor would pass his drug tests.|$|E
5|$|On October 31, 2012, Microsoft and government-owned {{organization}} Liechtenstein Marketing {{transformed the}} countryside of Liechtenstein {{for a special}} live action event <b>for</b> <b>fans</b> {{and members of the}} press.

5|$|Reviewers {{preferred}} the Nintendo64 port over the arcade release, and appreciated its audiovisual enhancements, but felt that its graphical upgrades and memorization-based combo gameplay were insufficient {{when compared to}} fighting games like Tekken 2 and Virtua Fighter 2. Critics recommended Gold primarily <b>for</b> <b>fans</b> of the series and genre, but IGN reported that even fans were upset by changes in the combo system {{and the absence of}} several well-liked characters. Gold ultimately did not replicate the success of its Super NES predecessor, and the series remained dormant through its 2002 acquisition by Microsoft until its 2013 reboot.|$|E
