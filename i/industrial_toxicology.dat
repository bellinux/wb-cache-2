5000|$|This work {{provided}} the stimulus {{for the emergence}} of a new discipline of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Toxicology</b> in India, where toxic exposure had remained an unrecognised health hazard. Dr. Zaidi became the Founding Director of the first institute in South East Asia - <b>Industrial</b> <b>Toxicology</b> Research Center (ITRC) in Lucknow (now renamed as Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, IITR). It moved from its temporary CDRI quarters to the current building, as of 2015. The premises were visited by the then President of India, V. V. Giri, and the new buildings dedicated on 27 July 1976 by President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, per a [...] "News Item" [...] published in Clinical Toxicology, which also comments on the role of Dr. Zaidi in nurturing many areas of <b>industrial</b> <b>toxicology.</b> [...] Beginning as a modest sized set of laboratories with few interested scientists, ITRC witnessed growth during the late 1960s and 1970s. There were only few other centres of excellence that were involved in research in <b>Industrial</b> <b>Toxicology</b> worldwide, including those headed by Professor Schilipkoter in Düsseldorf, Germany, and Dr. Erwing Selikoff at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. During his tenure at ITRC, Zaidi continued to work on cellular mechanisms through which asbestos, silica and other dusts as well as other industrial toxins affected human health (for example [...] ). His research was funded continuously by the Public Health Service of the United States through their PL480 scheme.|$|E
5000|$|During {{his tenure}} as Director of ITRC, Dr. Zaidi served on {{multiple}} national, governmental and international committees, and was an Indian delegate to {{various parts of the}} world including Germany, France, United Kingdom, United States, Egypt, and USSR, with a brief to promote <b>industrial</b> <b>toxicology</b> and initiate research collaborations. In 1975, he hosted [...] "The International Symposium on Industrial Toxicology" [...] in Lucknow, which showcased the then cutting-edge science in the field of industrial medicine. He was thereafter inducted as President of the Asian Society of Environmental <b>Industrial</b> <b>Toxicology</b> (1975). He was also Professor at the Azad University in Kanpur, and Visiting Professor to the University of Düsseldorf on two occasions, where he participated in further studies on the action of toxic metals.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of whther, and if so, to what extent, non-animal tests or testing strategies could significantly reduce or even replace {{the need for}} in vivo acute systemic toxicity tests is still unresolved. According to the current view of many regulatory and <b>industrial</b> <b>toxicologies,</b> knowledge of the in vivo toxic effects resulting from acute poisoning {{is a prerequisite for}} trying to ensure that workers and consumers are adequately protected. In vitro methods for acute toxicity testing could, however, be used in a tier testing scheme {{to reduce the number of}} animals used (and to reduce animal suffering). Such an approach is a natural progression of recent attempts to refine in vivo acute toxicity tests by the use of sequential dosing methods (such as the acute toxic class and up-and-down procedures). In these in vivo tests, use of the minimum number of animals possible depends upon the correct choise of the starting dose; this could be optimised by conducting approapriate in vitro tests prior to any animal tests which were then considered to be necessary.

Professional safety studies include <b>industrial</b> hygiene and <b>toxicology,</b> design of engineering hazard controls, fire protection, ergonomics, system and process safety, system safety, safety and health program management, accident investigation and analysis, product safety, construction safety, education and training methods, measurement of safety performance, human behavior, environmental safety and health, and safety, health and environmental laws, regulations and standards. Many safety engineers have backgrounds or advanced study in other disciplines, such as management and business administration, engineering, system engineering / industrial engineering, requirements engineering, reliability engineering, maintenance, human factors, operations, education, physical and social sciences and other fields.

40|$|Workers and {{employees}} are increasingly exposed {{in the workplace}} to chemical compounds and substances that are potentially toxic; for most of these compounds, no information exist regarding effects on human health. As {{one of the main}} employment generation sources, Small and Medium size Enterprises (SMEs) host a significant proportion of the environmental hazards currently present in the workplace. However, only a negligible amount of research or information has been completed and collected concerning SMEs environmental and health performance. SMEs possess environmental perceptions and an environmental and health behavior conditioned by the same qualitative attributes inherent to the small firm, from the kin relationships among the business members to the social role of the small company in a given community. With a prominent economic and social role in the society, SMEs are an important and still underestimated link in the environment-to-health chain. This thesis proposes an Environmental and Health Management model for SMEs. The model considers the convergence of medical, environmental, labor, and safety approaches and explores their interrelationship in three main components: the environmental conditions in the workplace, the (individuals) health conditions in the workplace, and the work-related conditions in the workplace. Nine fields of knowledge (Industrial Safety, Occupational Health, Occupational Medicine, Epidemiology, <b>Industrial</b> Hygiene, <b>Toxicology,</b> Environmental Health, Environmental Management, and Risk assessment) are considered as useful tools and approaches whose interaction may help SMEs to shape or modify their environmental perceptions and behavior, as well as may provide a general framework for the regulations applicable to SMEs. by Juan C.

Pirogov”, Sofia 	 21 Totleben blvd. 	 1606 Sofia 	е-mail: jrsaeva 2 @yahoo. co. ukThe {{traditional}} {{definition of}} toxicology is "the science of poisons. " A more descriptive definition is "the {{study of the}} adverse effects of chemicals, biological or physical agents on living organisms". These adverse effects may occur in many forms, ranging from immediate death to subtle changes not realized until months or years later. Knowledge of how toxic agents damage the body has progressed along with medical knowledge. The historical development of toxicology began with early cave dwellers who recognized poisonous plants and animals and used their extracts for hunting or in warfare. By 1500 BC, written recordings indicated that hemlock, opium, arrow poisons, and certain metals were used to poison enemies or for state executions. With time, poisons became widely used. Notable poisoning victims include Socrates, Cleopatra and Claudius. By {{the time of the}} Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment, certain concepts fundamental to toxicology began to take shape. Noteworthy in this regard were the studies of Paracelsus, a physician from the sixteenth century and one of the early “Fathers of Toxicology”, who is often quoted for his statement: "All substances are poisons; there is none which is not a poison. The right dose differentiates a poison and a remedy. " The Chemical (Industrial) Revolution of the mid- 19 th century released many naturally occurring chemicals into the environment in unprecedented amounts. Also, it produced and released new substances unlike any that had existed in the natural world. With the production and use of these chemicals, and the need to protect hu-mans from the toxic effects of <b>industrial</b> chemicals, <b>toxicology</b> eventually evolved to include its modern day branches: general toxicology, pharmacology, occupational toxicology, clinical toxicology, environmental toxicology...|$|R
