2500|$|Escaping to Parma, Casanova {{entered into}} a three-month affair with a Frenchwoman he named [...] "Henriette", perhaps the deepest love he ever experienced—a woman who {{combined}} beauty, intelligence, and culture. In his words, [...] "They who believe that a woman is incapable of making a man equally happy all the twenty-four {{hours of the day}} have never known an Henriette. The joy which flooded my soul was far greater when I conversed with her during the day than when I held <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> at night. Having read a great deal and having natural taste, Henriette judged rightly of everything." [...] She also judged Casanova astutely. As noted Casanovist J. Rives Childs wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b> She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} take <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b> She drew back as if I had frightened her.|$|E
60|$|I held <b>her</b> tightly <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b> The {{memory of}} that moment might have to last me all my life.|$|R
6000|$|... —I clasp'd <b>her</b> wildly <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>My</b> {{lips were}} join'd with hers. Some {{footsteps}} stirring I' th' next room parted us; 'twas you; what then Took place, you know.|$|R
60|$|Her weight seemed nothing. When I get a {{girl like}} that <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> I simply don't feel it. Just for one moment as I clasped <b>her</b> thus <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> a fierce thrill ran through me. But I let it run.|$|R
60|$|She put {{her hand}} to her throat--swayed. I made a step forward, and caught <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E
60|$|She turned away, half-laughing, half-crying; but I caught <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> {{and crushed}} her sweet lips against mine.|$|E
60|$|The mob rushed after, {{shouting}} horribly. Armantine {{began to}} cry, and I took <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> while Nicole held my son.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm quite well, thank you, Lady Beatrice," [...] I answered, {{looking down}} with keen {{pleasure}} into her sweet, childish face, and repressing {{a strong desire}} to take <b>her</b> up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> as Cecil had done, and give her a kiss.|$|R
60|$|The clock struck eleven. I {{looked at}} Adele, whose head leant against my shoulder; {{her eyes were}} waxing heavy, so I took <b>her</b> up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and carried <b>her</b> off to bed. It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies sought their chambers.|$|R
6000|$|... "She has fainted, Tim," [...] he said. [...] "Help me {{to raise}} <b>her</b> well <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> and lay <b>her</b> {{head on my}} shoulder. That's right. Now, you'll find her shawl somewhere under my feet; hold it up, and make a fan of it. Now, try to send some air into her face." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{tried to}} fold <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b> But she drew back. My fervour did not {{communicate}} itself; it only alarmed her.|$|E
60|$|In a bound I {{was beside}} her, and I had {{gathered}} <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> her little brown head against my shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|I folded <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> there, on the rusty-red South African desert. [...] "Then, Hilda dear," [...] I murmured, [...] "you will {{consent to}} marry me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well,” I said, flinging {{the door}} open and seizing <b>her</b> {{suddenly}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> “if you can’t walk then you shall be carried,” and I lifted her from the ground so abruptly that she could not help catching me round the neck as any child almost will do instinctively when you pick it up.|$|R
6000|$|Fel. No, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>my</b> sanctuary's placed; [...] Thus I will cling {{for ever}} to her waist. [...] [Running to her daughter.|$|R
60|$|I {{lifted her}} gently {{and led her}} to a chair. I was hard put to it not to hold <b>her</b> {{supported}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b> But I might not cull that advantage from her distress. A singular niceness, you will say, perhaps, as in your scorn you laugh at me. Perhaps you are right to laugh--yet are you not altogether right.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the fierce}} joy of that {{discovery}} I rushed forward to her, trembling, and clasped <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b> I {{could find no}} words but [...] "Hilda! Hilda!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{last she}} {{extended}} her hand. For {{the first time}} I wished to take <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and kiss her. I did kiss her hand many times.|$|E
6000|$|There was not {{an instant}} to lose. I seized <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and rushed over to the door, threw it open, and strode into the passage, calling loudly: ...|$|E
60|$|Cort. Under that shadow, thou would'st hide thy fear: Thou would'st possess thy love at thy return, And <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>my</b> easy virtue scorn.|$|R
6000|$|... "Saviour! It is yet time--time {{to snatch}} this poor soul from {{everlasting}} darkness. I believe--I believe in thy infinite love. What is my love or my pleading? It is quenched in thine. I can only clasp <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> weak <b>arms</b> and urge her with my weak pity. Thou--thou wilt breathe {{on the dead}} soul, and it shall arise from the unanswering sleep of death.|$|R
60|$|I {{believe that}} Mistress Ann had fainted clean away {{when she had}} caught sight of me {{climbing}} down the ladder, for we found {{that she was in}} no condition to move, so I picked <b>her</b> up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and bore <b>her</b> to the great cabin, the others following close behind. There I left them and went again upon deck, where I found that they were bringing the wounded up from below.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} me queerly. I saw her lips {{trembling}} and the tears swimming up in her eyes. She swayed toward me and I caught <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E
6000|$|What shall I say of the eagerness {{with which}} I {{looked forward to}} seeing my dear wife, the rapture with which, at last, I clasped <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms?</b> ...|$|E
60|$|Then I went to her. At {{my first}} step {{she gave a}} little cry and swayed, and had I not taken <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> I believe she would have fallen.|$|E
60|$|Her words made me ashamed, and I {{could not}} reply. But the shame was as nothing in {{strength}} {{compared to the}} impulse I felt to clasp <b>her</b> beautiful body <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and cover <b>her</b> face with kisses. Sick with desire, I turned away and, sitting on a root of the tree, covered my face with my hands.|$|R
6000|$|The {{women were}} {{an example to}} us. They trembled very much, but they were quiet and {{perfectly}} collected. [...] "Kiss me, Captain Ravender," [...] says Mrs. Atherfield, [...] "and God in heaven bless you, you good man!" [...] "My dear," [...] says I, [...] "those words are better for me than a life-boat." [...] I held <b>her</b> child <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> till {{she was in the}} boat, and then kissed the child and handed her safe down. I now said to the people <b>in</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "You have got your freight, my lads, all but me, and I am not coming yet awhile. Pull away from the ship, and keep off!" ...|$|R
60|$|Fortunately, {{it was not}} {{necessary}} to continue the discussion any longer, for at this juncture one of the watchers from the sick-room came to report that the mother was still sleeping peacefully, hearing which, the father rose to seek a little needful rest in an adjoining room. Before going, however, he proposed, with mistaken kindness, to relieve me of my burden, and place the girl without waking her on a couch. But I would not consent to have her disturbed; and finally, to my great delight, they left <b>her</b> still <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> the father warmly pressing my hand, and advising me to reflect well on his words concerning prayer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not. That I {{will never}} do. If {{it should come}} to pass that she must go from me for ever, I would have <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> to the very last!" ...|$|E
60|$|In that miserable discovery, I forgot {{everything}} else. I flew to her, {{and caught}} <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b> I cast {{one look at}} her pale, wasted face--and burst out crying on her bosom.|$|E
6000|$|... 'This is hard!' cried Mr Pecksniff, {{addressing}} his breakfast-cup. 'This is very hard! She is my child. I carried <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> {{when she}} wore shapeless worsted shoes--I might say, mufflers--many years ago!' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{poor little}} thing {{was white and}} wild with terror. She was {{incapable}} of uttering a word. When I knelt down to fondle and soothe her, she caught convulsively at my hand, and attempted to raise me. I got on my feet again. She repeated her dumb cry more loudly--and tried to drag {{me out of the}} house. She was so weak that she staggered under the effort. I took <b>her</b> up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b> One of <b>my</b> hands, as I embraced her, touched the top of her frock, just below the back of her neck. I felt something on my fingers. I looked at them. Gracious God! I was stained with blood! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{rushed into}} the kitchen and seized the poker, and then heaped wood on the fire, and lighted all the candles I could find; for I felt as though I could keep up my courage better if I had plenty of light. Strange and {{improbable}} as it may appear, the next thing that attracted my attention was my poor pussy, crouched up, panic-stricken, in a corner. I was so fond of the little creature that I took <b>her</b> up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and carried <b>her</b> into my bedroom and put her inside my bed. A comical thing to do in a situation of deadly peril, was it not? But it seemed quite natural and proper at the time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me rest {{once more}} on your bosom, Miles," [...] said Grace, {{reclining}} <b>her</b> head <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> quite exhausted under {{the reaction of}} the excitement she had felt while urging her request. [...] "I feel happier, at this moment, than I have been for a long time; yet, my increasing weakness admonishes me it cannot last long. Miles, darling, you must remember all our sainted mother taught you in childhood, and you will not mourn over my loss. Could I leave you united to one who understood and appreciated your worth, I should die contented. But you will be left alone, poor Miles; for a time, at least, you will mourn for me." ...|$|R
