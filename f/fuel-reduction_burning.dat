40|$|Each year, {{between one}} and three per cent of the total forested area in Victoria is fuel-reduced {{as a part of}} the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources' program to {{implement}} its overall fire protection policy. The dry sclerophyll Wombat State Forest has been fuel-reduced since the 1960 's, - a practise considered important because of its susceptibility to fire and its highly flammable plant community. This thesis presents the results of an evaluation of <b>fuel-reduction</b> <b>burning</b> in the Wombat State Forest, commencing with a review of forest conditions, principles of <b>fuel-reduction</b> <b>burning,</b> fire behaviour and fire effects. This is followed by observations and measurements in the field to document current practices of <b>fuel-reduction</b> <b>burning,</b> to select an appropriate fire-behaviour prediction model, to identify time-intervals between successive burns and to evaluate the effects of <b>fuel-reduction</b> <b>burning</b> on forest trees. Historical data of wildfires were used to evaluate the effectiveness of <b>fuel-reduction</b> <b>burning</b> in limiting the number, area and losses from wildfires. "Multi-criteria analysis" was then applied to select priority areas for <b>fuel-reduction</b> <b>burning.</b> The <b>fuel-reduction</b> <b>burning</b> program which is conducted 'every year during autumn and spring requires detailed planning and preparation, because it can only be carried out under certain prescriptions for weather, fuel and fire behaviour. Depending on the extent and conditions of each area, either ground or aerial ignition is applied. Large areas ignited from the air often result in variations of fire behaviour and intensity that leave many un-burnt patches within the broad areas of burnt forest. In order to predict fire-behaviour, comparisons were made between the Control Burning Meter, the McArthur Fire Danger Meter and the Fire Behaviour Tables for Western Australia (the Red Book). From a study of small trial plots, it was shown that the fire behaviour model incorporated in the Control Burning Meter for messmate-gum or silvertop forest type provided quite realistic predictions of low-intensity prescribed fires compared with predictions based on the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Meter and the Fire Behaviour Tables for Western Australia. Since its inception, <b>fuel-reduction</b> <b>burning</b> in the Wombat State Forest has decreased the quantity of litter and twigs, but it has had no significant effect on the quantity of humus and coarse fuels. This reduction of flammable fuels has reduced the potential for major fires and the study showed that a <b>fuel-reduction</b> <b>burning</b> cycle of less than five years is required to restrict the build up of fine fuels to acceptable levels. With regard to the impact of <b>fuel-reduction</b> <b>burning,</b> it was shown that it causes scorches on most trees, and that there is a significant relationship between scorch-height and tree diameter for the two dominant species, messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua L'Herit) and peppermint (E. radiata Sieb. ex. DC.). However, because of their different bark types, average scorch height was higher for messmate. Due to the considerable variation in the severity of fire seasons, hence in the frequency and severity of fire, no significant differences were detected in the number of wildfires and the extent of areas burnt, before and after the application of <b>fuel-reduction</b> <b>burning</b> in the Wombat State Forest. However, analysis of the historical fire data led to the conclusion that <b>fuel-reduction</b> <b>burning</b> has achieved its objective of limiting the severity of wildfires. Most of the wildfires occurred on areas that either had never been fuel-reduced or that had been fuel-reduced for more than five years. The costs of <b>fuel-reduction</b> <b>burning</b> have been relatively modest in comparison with the potential losses. Therefore, when properly planned and implemented, <b>fuel-reduction</b> <b>burning</b> is a valuable management tool for protecting forests and wider community values. This study has also provided a general idea on the applicability of "multi-criteria analysis" for identifying priority areas for <b>fuel-reduction</b> <b>burning</b> in the Wombat State Forest, with priority areas being selected on the basis of level of fire hazard (fuel, weather and topographical conditions) and values of particular sites (significant values, timber quality, distance from the nearest township and extent of the area). The result was a ranking of areas according to their priorities for burning. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
40|$|Forestry {{practices}} such as <b>fuel-reduction</b> <b>burning</b> and maintenance of road networks can negatively impact avian assemblages, both directly by changing habitat structure and indirectly by creating conditions favorable for predators or competitors. The Brigalow Belt forests include {{some of the largest}} contiguous areas of native forest in the temperate and sub-humid zones of eastern Australia. Over 1 million ha of these forests are proposed to be converted from forestry to conservation tenure, yet the impacts on the avifauna of current and potential future forest management practices are not known. We investigated the influence of road edges and habitat type and structure on the avifauna of a 356 000 ha forest. Survey sites were either 300 m from a road, and in either cypress pine Callitris glaucophylla forest, spotted gum Corymbia citriodora forest with a regenerating cypress pine/buloke Allocasuarina luehmannii understorey or spotted gum forest with an open understorey due to <b>fuel-reduction</b> <b>burning.</b> The avifauna differed significantly among vegetation types but not with proximity to a road, with the greatest differences between cypress pine and both types of spotted gum forest. The noisy miner Manorina melanocephala, an aggressive avian competitor, appears to be the factor mediating these assemblage-level differences. Noisy miners were rare in cypress pine forest but were three times more numerous than any other species in spotted gum forest. Spotted gum forest with a regenerating understorey had fewer noisy miners. Although total bird abundance was highest in open spotted gum forest, the species richness and abundance of passerines smaller than noisy miners was significantly lower in this forest type. Abundance of small passerines was eight times higher in sites where < 3 noisy miners were recorded. Only one species, the eastern yellow robin, was influenced by proximity to a road edge. Cypress pine forest is potentially an important refuge for smaller birds. The results suggest that burning regimes that reduce regeneration of the cypress pine and buloke subcanopy in spotted gum forest potentially are exacerbating the problem of noisy miner domination of the avifauna...|$|E
40|$|Prescribed burning is a {{commonly}} adopted fire-management strategy {{that attempts to}} protect human life and assets by removing accumulated, flammable biomass. Heterogeneous burning patterns are often favoured {{in an attempt to}} balance fuel-reduction and biodiversity goals under the ‘pyrodiversity begets biodiversity’ paradigm. Using comprehensive spatiotemporal monitoring data, we quantified the impacts of fire on bird assemblages in the peri-urban temperate woodlands of the Mount Lofty Ranges, South Australia, where the frequency of prescribed burning is increasing. After accounting for regional trends and site effects, sites burnt 20 years previously accommodated 15 % fewer birds than unburnt sites, while sites burnt in the preceding year had 22 % fewer birds. Fire also modified bird assemblages, favouring generalists and ground-feeding species. Of 60 species considered, 37 % were both declining and negatively impacted by recent burning, while burning reinforced increasing trends in 30 % of species, particularly large, common birds (e. g., magpies, ravens, wattlebirds). Simulations of avian alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity under different fire-management scenarios predicted higher avian diversity for scenarios that retained unburnt woodlands relative to those that managed all sites. Relative to a no-fire scenario, for example, burning sites once every 10 years was simulated to reduce the abundance of woodland generalists by 7 % and woodland specialists by 10 %, while retaining some long-unburnt woodland ameliorated these effects. There is a trade-off between <b>fuel-reduction</b> <b>burning</b> and conservation goals; to maximise avian diversity and avert the replacement of woodland bird species with generalists, fire-management planning should preserve long-unburnt woodland habitat...|$|E
