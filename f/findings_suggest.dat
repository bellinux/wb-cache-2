5|$|Around {{one-third of}} people with {{psoriasis}} report {{a family history of}} the disease, and researchers have identified genetic loci associated with the condition. Identical twin studies suggest a 70% chance of a twin developing psoriasis if the other twin has the disorder. The risk is around 20% for nonidentical twins. These <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> both a genetic susceptibility and an environmental response in developing psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|In {{those who}} are {{otherwise}} healthy, {{there is little evidence}} that supplements have any benefits with respect to cancer or heart disease. Vitamin A and E supplements not only provide no health benefits for generally healthy individuals, but they may increase mortality, though the two large studies that support this conclusion included smokers for whom it was already known that beta-carotene supplements can be harmful. While other <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that vitamin E toxicity is limited to only a specific form when taken in excess.|$|E
5|$|No {{mention of}} Osorkon IV is known after 716 BC. Some archaeological <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that shortly after this date, Bocchoris (Bakenrenef) of the 24th Dynasty may have {{expanded}} his realm eastward, supplanting Osorkon at Tanis. In 712 BC, Piye's successor Shebitku marched northward and defeated Bocchoris. When {{around the same}} year King Iamani of Ashdod sought refuge from Sargon II in Egypt, Shebitku {{was in fact the}} sole ruler of Egypt, and returned Iamani to the Assyrians in chains. In any case, Osorkon IV was seemingly dead before that year.|$|E

25|$|These <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> {{that two}} {{processes}} affect the reminiscence bump phenomenon: (1) Events in adolescence are encoded {{more strongly than}} events that occur in other periods of life. (2) Because these events are initially stored more intensely, they will be retrieved more frequently.|$|E
25|$|Recent <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that, as {{the virus}} infects human cells, host homeostatic {{processes}} like autophagy and ER stress response, {{not to mention}} apoptosis, are triggered depending on the infected cell type. The activation of autophagy and ER stress during infection enhances virus reproduction.|$|E

40|$|A study {{investigated}} the possible existence of financial discrimination resulting in disparate funding treatment of historically black higher education institutions. <b>Findings</b> <b>suggested</b> that possible funding disparities in the financing of historically black universities and colleges could still be a concern. <b>Findings</b> <b>suggested</b> {{the need for an}} overall redistribution of state funding to move predominantly white and {{historically black colleges and universities}} toward funding equality. Other findings of the study are discussed, and recommendations for future research are provided...|$|R
25|$|In {{recent years}} {{correlations}} between birth weight and shyness have been studied. <b>Findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that those born at low birth weights {{are more likely}} to be shy, risk-aversive and cautious compared to those born at normal birth weights.

25|$|Recent <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that Finnish trade {{connections}} already {{became more}} active during the 8th century bringing {{an influx of}} silver onto Finnish markets. The opening of the eastern route to Constantinople via Finland's southern coastline archipelago brought Arabic and Byzantine artifacts into the excavation findings of the era.|$|E

25|$|In vitro {{studies show}} that Notch can {{influence}} neurite development. In vivo, deletion of the Notch signaling modulator, Numb, disrupts neuronal maturation in the developing cerebellum, whereas deletion of Numb disrupts axonal arborization in sensory ganglia. Although the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not clear, together these <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> Notch signaling might be crucial in neuronal maturation.|$|E
25|$|Findings {{have also}} shown monoamine oxidase A {{to affect the}} {{predictive}} ability of the PCL-R. Monoamine oxidases (MAOs) are enzymes {{that are involved in}} the breakdown of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine and are, therefore, capable of influencing feelings, mood, and behavior in individuals. <b>Findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that further research is needed in this area.|$|E
25|$|Mockley Phase of Middle Woodland {{dates from}} 40 CE of the Norfolk, Virginia {{region of the}} lower Chesapeake Bay. These people {{generally}} lived in smaller encampments as they fished and clammed. A few storage pits have been identified (Potter 1994). They had limited gardening, as recent <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> they included the sunflower which predates the large-scale Mesoamerican influence in the Carolinas and Virginia.|$|E

In the other 10 patients, clinical and laboratory <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> meningitis or meningo-encephalitis from other etiologies (control group).

25|$|Psychological {{research}} {{has looked at}} the tinnitus distress reaction (TDR) to account for differences in tinnitus severity. These <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that at the initial perception of tinnitus, conditioning links tinnitus with negative emotions, such as fear and anxiety from unpleasant stimuli at the time. This enhances activity in the limbic system and autonomic nervous system, thus increasing tinnitus awareness and annoyance.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{research}} suggests the social component of ritual. For instance, <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that ritual performance indicates group commitment and prevents the uncommitted from gaining membership benefits. Ritual may aid in emphasizing moral values {{that serve as}} group norms and regulate societies. It may also strengthen commitment to moral convictions and likelihood of upholding these social expectations. Thus, performance of rituals may foster social group stability.|$|E
25|$|During the {{excavations}} {{conducted in}} the forest {{to the west of}} Allianoi, a vessel of the type known as Yortan (dating from the Early Bronze Age II) was found. On the hills of Ã‡akmaktepe (Flint Hill) nearby, a high quantity of flintstones were found during surveys. Additionally, two stone axes were unearthed from an earth fill. These <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> some form of prehistoric settlement at or near Allianoi.|$|E
