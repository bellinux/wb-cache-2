5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> single {{degenerate}} progenitors {{account for}} no more than 20% of all Type Ia supernovae.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} reports of albino {{lampreys}} and it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> this occurs at a frequency {{of one in}} 100,000 normal individuals.|$|E
5|$|Although legend {{places the}} tree much earlier, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> Pi de les Tres Branques took root between 1630 and 1632, {{when the local}} {{farmhouse}} was built.|$|E
50|$|In 1907, it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> there <b>were</b> around 282,000 {{inhabitants}} in Montenegro, {{the majority}} of Orthodox faith.|$|R
50|$|It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> the {{additional}} parking for the Padres {{would have cost}} $75 million {{on top of the}} Chargers' proposal.|$|R
50|$|The {{extent of}} human {{trafficking}} in Australia {{is difficult to}} quantify. However, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> the number ranges between 300 and 1000 a year. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) lists Australia as one of 21 trafficking destination countries in the high destination category.|$|R
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> {{all of the}} English witch trials {{between the}} early 15th and early 18th centuries {{resulted}} in fewer than 500 executions, so this one trial, with its 18 executions, accounted for 3.6% of that total.|$|E
5|$|The monastery at Wearmouth-Jarrow had an {{excellent}} library. Both Benedict Biscop and Ceolfrith had acquired books from the Continent, and in Bede's day the monastery was a renowned centre of learning. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> there were about 200 books in the monastic library.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a nominal roll or other records listing the Australians {{who took part in the}} D-Day landings, it is not {{possible}} to determine the exact number involved. However, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> about 3,000 Australian military personnel and merchant seamen participated in the operation. The total number of Australians killed on 6 June was 14, of whom 12 were RAAF airmen and two were members of the RAN.|$|E
5000|$|Retraction Watch has {{demonstrated}} that retractions are more common than was previously thought. When Retraction Watch was launched, Marcus [...] "wondered if we'd have enough material". It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> about 80 papers were retracted annually. However, in its first year, the blog reported on approximately 200 retractions.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> about 292,700 people (1.8%) of the Chilean {{population}} had {{some type of}} auditory deficiency. About {{half of the people}} with auditory deficiency are over the age of 65. This leaves the estimated amount of users who actually use LSCh at only about 21,000 people.|$|R
50|$|Fatico {{conducted}} the hijacking of cargoes at John F. Kennedy Airport {{and on the}} Brooklyn waterfront. He dealt in stolen merchandise, loansharking, bookmaking, number-running, floating dice games, illegal casinos, sports book betting and the operation of push-button poker machines. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> Fatico's crew grossed approximately $30 million a year.|$|R
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> {{the group}} {{containing}} the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire diverged from genera like Goura about 1.5 million years ago. However, that estimate appears highly unlikely. It was {{estimated that the}} relatives of the two species moved to the island about 35 million years ago, when a land bridge between Nazareth (Rodrigues) or St. Brandon banks and Mauritius formed.|$|E
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> {{the solid}} earth {{as a whole}} {{contains}} 730 ppm of carbon, with 2000 ppm in the core and 120 ppm in the combined mantle and crust. Since {{the mass of the}} earth is , this would imply 4360 million gigatonnes of carbon. This is much more than the amount of carbon in the oceans or atmosphere (below).|$|E
5|$|New {{species in}} the Russulaceae {{continue}} to be described from various regions, such as the US, Guyana, Brazil, Patagonia, Togo, Sri Lanka, or Thailand. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> the real number of Russula species in North America alone (currently around 400 described) might {{be as high as}} 2000. Cryptic species may increase true diversity: some morphologically well-defined species, especially in Lactifluus, have been shown to actually encompass several phylogenetic species.|$|E
50|$|It {{cost the}} state around $23,000 a year to operate the park. It was not {{regularly}} staffed, and the entrance fee was collected with a box at the gate that visitors were expected to place their fee into. Prior to 2010, it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> as few as 10 percent of visitors paid the fee.|$|R
5000|$|Zardari was {{appointed}} {{chairman of the}} PPP on 30 December 2007. Asif Zardari also announced his son's name change from [...] "Bilawal Zardari" [...] to [...] "Bilawal Bhutto Zardari". At that time he was still studying at Oxford. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> Zardari's security at Oxford may cost at least one million pounds each year.|$|R
50|$|On April 9, 1903, {{the first}} main {{building}} of St. Edward’s {{burned to the}} ground. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> the fire {{broke out in the}} attic and completely destroyed the interior of the massive, gothic, white limestone edifice. Within two days the plans <b>had</b> <b>been</b> drawn up the rebuild the magnificent structure. The specifications called for a central portion of 107 feet by 50 feet.|$|R
5|$|The {{freshwater}} {{islands in}} Scotland include those within freshwater lochs and rivers – including tidal areas, so the islands {{may not always}} be surrounded by freshwater. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> there are at least 31,460 freshwater lochs in Scotland and that 1.9% of the land surface is covered by fresh waters. The distribution has a north west to south east gradient with the highest concentrations occurring in the islands of the Outer Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00 on 16 December 1941, Corregidor {{left its}} dock in Manila in total darkness, loaded to {{overcapacity}} with Filipino civilians seeking {{to escape to}} the southern Philippines after the war had started. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> between 1,200 and 1,500 people were on board, including approximately 150 Philippine soldiers, 7 Americans, 5 Philippine legislators, and hundreds of college students who were traveling home after their schools had closed. Also aboard were military supplies as well the entire artillery complement of the Visayan-Mindanao Force of the Philippine Army. The owners of the ship failed to inform the Navy's Inshore Patrol of the ship's plan to leave Manila Bay.|$|E
5|$|Blakeney Point, {{like most}} of the {{northern}} part of the marshes in this area, is part of the parish of Cley next the Sea. The main spit runs roughly west to east, and joins the mainland at Cley Beach before continuing onwards as a coastal ridge to Weybourne. It is approximately 6.4km (4mi) long, and is composed of a shingle bank which in places is 20m (65ft) in width and up to 10m (33feet) high. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> there are 2.3millionm3 (82millionft3) of shingle in the spit, 97per cent of which is derived from flint.|$|E
50|$|Heavy rains that March put the dam to {{its first}} test. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> it would take three years to fill the lake. So heavy were the rains that the lake filled in only three days. An unconfirmed, but {{plausible}} urban legend claims that the construction equipment left on the lake bed in 1938 during the rains remains {{at the bottom of}} the lake today.|$|R
5000|$|During a July 7, 2010, {{interview}} on CNBC Simmons claimed that scientists were reporting the flow rate {{from the oil}} spill was [...] "spewing 120,000 barrels a day into the Gulf" [...] and <b>that</b> there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> we <b>have</b> [...] "lost oxygen for 40% of the Gulf of Mexico". He further claimed that the relief wells will not stop the oil spill.|$|R
5|$|Following his {{retirement}} from the NWMP, Primrose {{was offered the}} position of a police magistrate in Edmonton. Primrose accepted, as he had always wanted to retire in the city. In 1917, he was chairman of the three-person Alberta Provincial Police board of commissioners, where he was tasked with supervising the new force. Before {{his retirement}} as magistrate in July 1935, it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> he <b>had</b> dealt with over 40,000 cases.|$|R
5|$|Emperors of the {{proceeding}} Song dynasty (960–1279) {{tended to}} marry from {{within their own}} borders. Tang emperors, mainly took their wives from high-ranking bureaucratic families, but the Song dynasty did not consider rank important {{when it came to}} selecting their consorts. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> only a quarter of Song consorts were from such families, with the rest being from lower status backgrounds. For example, Liu, consort of Emperor Zhenzong, had been a street performer and consort Miao, wife of Emperor Renzong was the daughter of his own wet nurse.|$|E
5|$|Globally, Mozzarella is {{the most}} popular pizza cheese. However, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> in the United States only 30% of all pizza cheese used is actual Mozzarella. Provolone is the second most popular one. Cheddar may be mixed with Mozzarella to {{preserve}} chewiness. Grated Parmesan may be added {{to the top of a}} pizza, and typically does not melt well when cooked. A diverse variety of processed pizza cheeses are produced, including analogue cheese. Provel is one example. Other pizza cheeses include Emmental, Romano and Ricotta for calzones or as a topping.|$|E
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> all the English witch trials {{between the}} early 15th and early 18th centuries {{resulted}} in fewer than 500 executions, so this one series of trials in July and August 1612 {{accounts for more}} than two per cent of that total. Court records show that Lancashire was unusual in the north of England for the frequency of its witch trials. Neighbouring Cheshire, for instance, also suffered from economic problems and religious activists, but there only 47 people were indicted for causing harm by witchcraft between 1589 and 1675, of whom 11 were found guilty.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, {{the total}} Muslim {{population}} in the United States reached approximately 3.3 million (0.9% of the U.S. population). Yet in the years between 2001 and 2014 it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> one {{quarter of a million}} U.S. convicts converted to Islam in the U.S. prison system, making prison converts to Islam just from those years (not counting prison converts to Islam before or since then) account for a significant proportion of all Muslims in the United States overall.|$|R
50|$|The {{surveyed}} {{route of}} the line crossed the Kowie River at Blaauwkrantz, where a high bridge needed to <b>be</b> constructed. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> the line would {{be completed by the}} end of 1883, but since the construction of the Blaauwkrantz Bridge delayed progress, the 43 mi line was only partially opened to traffic from Port Alfred as far as Blaauwkrantz on 24 December 1883. Here, passengers had to disembark and complete the journey to Grahamstown on the post cart.|$|R
50|$|When Galaxy Zoo first started, {{the science}} team hoped that 20-30,000 people would {{take part in}} {{classifying}} the 900,000 galaxies {{that made up the}} sample. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> a perfect graduate student working 24 hours a day 7 days a week would take 3-5 years to classify all the galaxies in the sample once. However, in the first Galaxy Zoo, more than 40 million classifications were made in approximately 175 days by more than 100,000 volunteers, providing an average of 38 classifications per galaxy.|$|R
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> of 92 {{potentially}} possible {{modes of}} life – combinations of feeding style, tiering and motility — {{no more than}} a dozen are occupied {{by the end of the}} Ediacaran. Just four are represented in the Avalon assemblage. The lack of large-scale predation and vertical burrowing are perhaps the most significant factors limiting the ecological diversity; the emergence of these during the Early Cambrian allowed the number of lifestyles occupied to rise to 30.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{enlargement}} of the primate brain comes from a massive expansion of the cerebral cortex, especially the prefrontal cortex and {{the parts of the}} cortex involved in vision. The visual processing network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas, with a complex web of interconnections. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> visual processing areas occupy {{more than half of the}} total surface of the primate neocortex. The prefrontal cortex carries out functions that include planning, working memory, motivation, attention, and executive control. It takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for primates than for other species, and an especially large fraction of the human brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} was never investigated {{due to the}} Japanese invasion. Later, some Army officers reported that the remote-controllable mines were set to the safety position immediately after the explosion occurred. The total number of victims is unknown. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> 900–1,200 lost their lives. Among the dead were the captain {{and most of the}} crew, two of the legislators, and one of the American passengers. At the time, the sinking of the Corregidor was the most significant maritime disaster in Philippine history, and one of the greatest maritime disasters in the world that did not occur as a result of military or naval action.|$|E
5000|$|In 1981, the FCC {{proposed}} the Inland Waterways Communication System (IWCS), a commercial maritime radio service with the proposed purpose of expanding private maritime communication {{and that was}} to operate from 216 to 220 MHz. [...] Earlier reports had studied the feasibility of using this frequency band, but warned of the high probability of adjacent-channel interference with TV channel 13. [...] However, by the early 1980s, it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> radio tuner technology had advanced to the point that such interference could be minimized.|$|R
50|$|Construction of the {{prototype}} was performed at Vickers' facility at Wisley Airfield, Surrey; flight trials would <b>have</b> also <b>been</b> based there. By November 1956, over £4 million <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{spent on the}} V-1000 project; the first prototype had also reached 80 per cent completion. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> the VC7 would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in operational service as early as 1959, the same {{year in which the}} first V-1000s were projected to be delivered to the RAF. If it had entered commercial service as envisioned, it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the first turbofan-equipped airliner to serve long-haul routes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{limestone}} sculpture measures {{just over}} 8 cm (3.25 in) tall. It {{was described by}} Sotheby's as [...] "one of the last known masterworks from the dawn of civilization remaining in private hands." [...] One day before the auction, experts <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>that</b> the highest bid would be between $14 million and $18 million. The sale price of the lioness-woman exceeded the $28.6 million paid for Artemis and the Stag, a 2,000-year-old bronze figure that Sotheby's also sold in New York during June 2007 and which then held {{the record for the}} most expensive antiquity to be sold at auction.|$|R
