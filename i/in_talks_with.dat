5|$|In 2008, {{there were}} rumours that Heather Mills was <b>in</b> <b>talks</b> <b>with</b> Gardein to {{publicise}} {{a new line}} of products. This was considered noteworthy at the time, as a preceding mock meats company, Linda McCartney Foods, was established by Linda McCartney (who was married to Paul McCartney. McCartney is also Mills' ex-partner). Mills had previously courted controversy in 2002 as people perceived her plans to write a vegetarian cookbook as mimicry of McCartney's own bestselling vegetarian cookbook.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, Stallone {{confirmed}} {{that he was}} <b>in</b> <b>talks</b> <b>with</b> Nicolas Cage and John Travolta, and scheduling {{would be the only}} obstacle to their involvement. In July 2011, Mickey Rourke was stated to be reprising his role as Tool; by late September it was reported that he had dropped out of the film, and on October 18 this was confirmed. Antonio Banderas was reportedly offered a role, but was unable to participate due to other commitments. Jackie Chan said he had been offered a role, but was forced to turn it down due to scheduling conflicts with CZ12.|$|E

5|$|On March 6, 2014, Sony {{announced}} that Screen Gems will distribute a film adaptation of The Last of Us, written by Druckmann and produced by Sam Raimi. By January 2015, Druckmann {{had written the}} script's second draft, and performed a read-through with some actors. Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered development hell. In November 2016, Raimi stated that the film was at a standstill after Sony had a disagreement with Druckmann. Actress Maisie Williams expressed enthusiasm in playing Ellie, and was <b>in</b> <b>talks</b> <b>with</b> both Druckmann and Raimi to take the role.|$|E
5|$|Pre-production {{began on}} October 5, 1997. <b>In</b> <b>talks</b> <b>with</b> investors, the {{directors}} presented an eight-minute documentary along with newspapers and news footage. The documentary was also aired on the defunct television series Split Screen hosted by John Pierson. The script {{began with a}} thirty-five page outline, with the dialogue to be improvised. Accordingly, the directors advertised in Backstage magazine for actors with strong improvisational abilities. There was a very informal improvisational audition process to narrow the pool of 2,000 actors.|$|E

There, they also meet Al-Cid Margrace, {{a member of the}} Rozarrian Empire ruling family, who is seeking to avert a war between Rozarria and Archadia and is <b>in</b> <b>talks</b> <b>with</b> Larsa.

5|$|When the Rhodesian {{government}} held {{talks with}} the African National Council on the railway bridge across the Victoria Falls in August 1975 (the train in which the talks took place was strategically {{in the middle of}} the bridge so that the ANC were in Zambia while the Rhodesians remained in Rhodesia), Van der Byl was not a member of the Rhodesian delegation. This was a curious omission given his position. He did however participate <b>in</b> <b>talks</b> <b>with</b> Joshua Nkomo that December.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{deployment}} to Syria of several new Russian military systems, various countries had reportedly {{expressed interest in}} the Su-35. These countries included Algeria, Egypt, and Vietnam. According to Kommersant, the Algerian military had requested an Su-35 for testing in February 2016; the country was satisfied with the fighter's flight characteristics and so Moscow is waiting for a formal application. It is expected that the first phase {{will focus on the}} acquisition of at least twelve aircraft. Other countries that had also expressed interest in the aircraft include Kazakhstan, North Korea, and Pakistan, although a Russian official denied that the country was <b>in</b> <b>talks</b> <b>with</b> the latter about the Su-35.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the Vietnamese occupation, the Kampuchean {{resistance}} groups had limited contact with each other due to their differences. Even though the Khmer Rouge enjoyed widespread international recognition, by 1980 the organization was under pressure to reform itself from the international community. ASEAN, which had backed the Khmer Rouge throughout their diplomatic confrontations with the PRK regime at the UN General Assembly in 1979, urged the Khmer Rouge leadership to put its blood-stained image behind it in order to join forces with other non-communist movements. However, the idea of forming an alliance with the Khmer Rouge initially caused a certain degree of uneasiness within the leadership circles of the FUNCINPEC and the KPNLF, because both groups were leery about joining with a communist organization well known for its brutality. Nonetheless, early in 1981, Sihanouk and Son Sann began engaging <b>in</b> <b>talks</b> <b>with</b> Khieu Samphan, President of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea, to discuss the prospect of forming an alliance.|$|E
5|$|Pete is <b>in</b> <b>talks</b> <b>with</b> Mohawk Airlines {{for their}} return to the agency. The {{arrangement}} calls for Roger to handle the day-to-day business. Roger puts Peggy in charge of hiring a new male copywriter for Mohawk. Stan advises her to hire a mediocre employee to make her competition lighter. Peggy, however, chooses to interview a talented young Jewish man named Michael Ginsberg whose work impresses her. When Peggy interviews Michael, he is over-the-top in his disposition. However, Roger forces her to bring Michael to Don. During his interview with Don, Michael is more upstanding and professional, which puzzles Peggy. Michael is hired. He returns home to find his domineering father reading the paper. Michael's personality changes yet again, this time more shy and reserved. When he learns of his son's success, Michael's father blesses his son with a Jewish prayer.|$|E

5|$|Since opening, {{there have}} been reports {{relating}} to an increased number of road traffic incidents at Switch Island, the main terminus of the A5758 road. Some road users have noted that a lack of clear road markings and signage may be a contributing factor towards the traffic collisions, whilst Sefton Council noted that they continue to review the operation of the road and associated junctions. Following continued incidents at the junction with Switch Island, the council confirmed in July 2016 that it was <b>in</b> <b>talks</b> <b>with</b> Highways England and Merseyside Police with Bill Esterson, MP for Sefton Central, calling for changes to be considered to the road to improve safety.|$|E
5|$|The primary duty of {{the foreign}} {{ministry}} was directing the general line of Soviet foreign policy. The MER represented the country abroad and participated <b>in</b> <b>talks</b> <b>with</b> foreign delegations {{on behalf of the}} Soviet government. It also appointed diplomatic officers, with the exception of Soviet ambassadors, who were appointed by the Council of Ministers. The MER was responsible for taking care of the USSR's economic and political interests abroad, although economic interests were also the joint responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The State Committee of the Council of Ministers on Cultural Links with Foreign Nations and the Ministry of Culture worked jointly with the MER in regards to the protection of Soviet citizens abroad, the exercise of overall Soviet consular relations abroad and the promotion of Soviet culture abroad. A less visible {{duty of the}} MER was its role in the coordination of Soviet intelligence operations abroad.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, {{the station}} {{became one of}} the UK's least {{efficient}} power stations. In 1998, plans were announced to use the station as a test-bed for clean coal technology, but the plans did not come to fruition. In 1999, then owners Innogy plc decided to take Blyth A out of operation, while Blyth B began operating only at times of peak demand, because the stations had become surplus to their generating needs. From 1 April 2000 onwards the station was taken out of service for the summer months, because of the low demand for electricity at that time of year. However, staff were retained to maintain the station. Innogy plc then began looking for a buyer for the station, to decide the site's future. They had been <b>in</b> <b>talks</b> <b>with</b> American based NRG Energy, over a £410million purchase of the station, along with the Killingholme Power Station in North Lincolnshire. There had also been rumours that a deal had been made to convert the station into a waste-to-energy plant. However, any plans to save the station fell through and the generation of electricity at the station ceased on 31 January 2001, after 43years of operating, resulting in the loss of 131jobs.|$|E
