25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning. As <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> with some of my friends over the past few weeks, my elected service is one piece of what I hope will be an {{interesting}} and diverse professional career. After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it {{is time for}} a change for me and my family. I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. I am grateful for the friendship and support of so many, especially my wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and my clients. It has been a privilege to serve.|$|E

A member of TYT spotted Ellison and Perez dining together {{a week before the}} election was held. Upon being elected chair, Perez quickly motioned for Ellison to be elected [...] "deputy chair", saying, [...] "it is a motion that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> with a good friend, and his name is Keith Ellison". The two newly elected chairs worked together when Perez was labor secretary, and he has regarded Ellison as one of his [...] "best allies". The position of [...] "deputy chair" [...] does not exist in the DNC's bylaws.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew {{states that}} Harold Wilson wrote on Trend's {{review of the}} Hollis and Mitchell cases: [...] "This is very {{disturbing}} stuff, even if concluding in 'not proven' verdicts". In 1981 Chapman Pincher claimed in his book Their Trade is Treachery that the Inquiry had cleared Mitchell and had concluded that Hollis was the [...] "likeliest suspect". On the day of publication of Pincher's book, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher made a statement in the House of Commons disclaiming Pincher, not mentioning Mitchell, but saying of Hollis that while the investigation [...] "did not conclusively prove his innocence" [...] that [...] "Lord Trend, with whom <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> the matter, agreed with those who, although {{it was impossible to}} prove the negative, concluded that Sir Roger Hollis had not been an agent of the Russian intelligence service".|$|E

If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> the subject {{now for the first time}} <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> given extracts from the works of the travellers of the day, but it seemed needless to reopen the inquiry merely to give it a more modern air. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> also preferred to let the chapter stand as it was written, because considerable portions of it have been quoted by various authors (e.g. Bagehot, Economic Studies, pp. 161 to 166: Longman, 1880), and the original memoir is not easily accessible.] ...|$|R
30|$|Most of the pre-service {{teachers}} regarded science as including mainly observation and/or experimentation, and they underestimated {{the significance of}} modeling in scientific work even though <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> modeling during the lessons.

6000|$|... "You don't look it. But I believe I {{rather like}} abstruse questions. You know Putney and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> a great many. But just {{what do you}} mean by this {{particular}} abstraction?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will save}} time, perhaps," [...] I interrupted, [...] "if I explain that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> all these matters with Madame Richard, and the {{decision}} which I have come to is final. The child remains here." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{records are}} right enough," [...] he said; [...] "you need trouble {{yourself}} no longer about the records. Eva and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> all that." [...] From this I {{became aware that}} Eva had convinced him of the baseness of the falsehood.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no scruple {{at all in}} marrying the Baroness von Haase," [...] Norgate replied firmly. [...] "As for the rest, you and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> {{fully the}} matter of the {{political}} relations between our countries.

6000|$|... "Well, of course. I hadn't {{overlooked}} that, {{you may be}} sure. One of {{the things}} that Fulkerson and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> is a scheme for buying the magazine. Its success is pretty well assured now, and I shouldn't be afraid to put money into it--if I had the money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whatever {{are your}} other intentions, Mrs. McClosky, {{as we are}} both Susy's guests, I beg you will say nothing of this to her while we are here, and {{particularly}} {{that you will not}} allow her to think for a moment that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> MY relations to her with anybody." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{therefore}} I do {{not think}} it would have been well had you endeavoured to gain my daughter's affections without speaking to me,--or to her mother." [...] Judge Staveley always spoke of his wife as though she were an absolute part of himself. [...] "She and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> the matter now,--and you are at liberty to address yourself to Madeline if you please." ...|$|E
40|$|Mobile {{wireless}} networks {{has shown}} tremendous increase in technology sector with {{the evolution of}} 4 G i. e. Fourth Generation.

60|$|My joy at {{coming back}} at this golden season {{to a country}} I loved was {{tempered}} by news <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard from Captain Wendell, and which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> with the officers at Fort Harmar. The Captain himself had broached the subject one cool evening, early in the journey, as we sat over the fire in our little cabin. He had been telling me about Brandywine, but suddenly {{he turned to me}} with a kind of fierce gesture that was natural to the man.|$|R
60|$|As exemplifying {{the effects}} of climatal changes on distribution, I have {{attempted}} to show how important has been {{the influence of the}} modern Glacial period, which I am fully convinced simultaneously affected the whole world, or at least great meridional belts. As showing how diversified are the means of occasional transport, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> at some little length the means of dispersal of fresh-water productions.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> at {{some little}} length, though as I am well aware, {{in a very}} {{imperfect}} manner, the acquirement of reflex actions, because they are often brought into play in connection with movements expressive of our emotions; and {{it was necessary to}} show {{that at least some of}} them might have been Erst acquired through the will in order to satisfy a desire, or to relieve a disagreeable sensation.|$|E
60|$|In the {{preceding}} pages <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> {{certain aspects of}} the present Labour situation. I have tried to show the profound significance in this discussion of the distrust which has grown up {{in the minds of the}} workers, and how this distrust is being exacerbated by our entirely too forensic method of treating their claims. I want now to point out a still more powerful set of influences which is steadily turning our Labour struggles from mere attempts to adjust hours and wages into movements that are gravely and deliberately revolutionary.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{reporter}} came {{boiling over}} the ridge about noon to-day, wanting me {{to give him the}} names which Dunn <b>had</b> given me. <b>I</b> was strongly tempted to do as he asked me to--you know these newspaper men are sometimes the best kind of detectives for running down criminals; but on second thought I concluded to wait until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> the matter with you. I haven't much faith in the county authorities." ...|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the ideas}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> in The Poverty of Historicism was the {{influence}} of a prediction upon the event predicted. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> called this the [...] "Oedipus effect", because the oracle played a most important role in the sequence of events which led to the fulfilment of its prophecy. … For a time I thought that the existence of the Oedipus effect distinguished the social from the natural sciences. But in biology, too—even in molecular biology—expectations often play a role in bringing about what has been expected.|$|R
60|$|As exemplifying {{the effects}} of climatical changes on distribution, I have {{attempted}} to show how important a part the last Glacial period has played, which affected even the equatorial regions, and which, during the alternations of the cold {{in the north and}} the south, allowed the productions of opposite hemispheres to mingle, and left some of them stranded on the mountain-summits {{in all parts of the}} world. As showing how diversified are the means of occasional transport, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> at some little length the means of dispersal of fresh-water productions.|$|E

[...] "My dear girl," [...] he said, {{in a tone}} of patient reasonableness, [...] "you are a mere child. You know nothing of life, nothing of its dangers, nothing of its possibilities. You think everything is harmless and simple, and so forth. It isn't. It isn't. That's where you go wrong. In some things, in many things, you must trust to your elders, to those who know more of life than you do. Your aunt and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> all this matter. There it is.

6000|$|... "There comes a time," [...] {{the latter}} continued, [...] "when {{every one of}} us is confronted with what might be {{described}} as the crisis of our lives. Yours has come, my guest, at precisely this moment. It is, if my watch tells me the truth, five and twenty minutes to four. It is the last day of April. The year you know. You have exactly one minute to decide whether you will live a short time longer, or whether you will on this last day of April, and before--say, a quarter to four, make that little journey the nature of which you and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> more than once." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{been greatly}} mortified {{to find that}} my {{observations}} would have shewn me the planet {{in the early part}} of August if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> only <b>discussed</b> them. ... <b>I</b> delayed doing this ... chiefly because I was making a grand effort to reduce the vast numbers of comet observations which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> accumulated and this occupied the whole of my time.|$|R
