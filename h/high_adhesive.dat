5|$|The {{intrinsic}} hydrophobicity of {{a surface}} {{can be enhanced}} by being textured with different length scales of roughness. The red rose takes advantage of this by using a hierarchy of micro- and nanostructures on each petal to provide sufficient roughness for superhydrophobicity. More specifically, each rose petal has a collection of micropapillae {{on the surface and}} each papilla, in turn, has many nanofolds. The term “petal effect” describes the fact that a water droplet on the surface of a rose petal is spherical in shape, but cannot roll off even if the petal is turned upside down. The water drops maintain their spherical shape due to the superhydrophobicity of the petal (contact angle of about 152.4°), but do not roll off because the petal surface has a <b>high</b> <b>adhesive</b> force with water.|$|E

A natural extension of the 4-4-0 American wheel arrangement, the four-wheel leading bogie gave good stability at speed and allowed a longer boiler to be supported, while the lack of trailing wheels gave a <b>high</b> <b>adhesive</b> weight.|$|E

Floors with a fibreboard core are hygroscpoic and must never be exposed to large amounts of water or very high humidity - the expansion caused from absorbing water combined with the density of the fibreboard, will cause it to lose its form.

30|$|A Missouri Department of Transportation report (Myers et al. 2010) on {{structural}} steel coatings for corrosion mitigation mentions that drainage {{of water from}} the deck onto the superstructure was the primary factor leading to service failures of the coating. It was reported that inorganic zinc primers were effective at hindering corrosion; however, organic zinc primer had <b>higher</b> <b>adhesive</b> strengths. The document also reported that overcoating provides an alternative maintenance option that reduces cost and disruption of the highway system; however, it comes with an increased level of risk of early failure of the newly applied system (as opposed to the full blast and repaint approach). Additionally, polyurea type coatings were reported to be effective at producing bond strength, but the salt-induced corrosion inhibition was not as strong as the systems with a high solid zinc primer. Organic zinc primer was reported to be more effective due to <b>higher</b> <b>adhesive</b> strengths and a lower probability of the primer peeling off. A promising review of the application of micaceous iron oxide zinc primer with aliphatic polyurea polyaspartic topcoat system was reported to have almost equal performance in terms of salt-fog resistance when compared to blast cleaning and application of a zinc rich primer. It also provided the added feature of superior UV resistance with good freeze–thaw stability.|$|R

40|$|The Australian masonry {{standard}} allows either prism {{tests or}} correction factors {{based on the}} block height and mortar thickness to evaluate masonry compressive strength. The correction factor helps the taller units with conventional 10 mm mortar being not disadvantaged due to size effect. In recent times, 2 - 4 mm thick, high-adhesive mortars and H blocks with only the mid-web shell are used in masonry construction. H blocks and thinner and <b>higher</b> <b>adhesive</b> mortars have renewed interest of the compression behaviour of hollow concrete masonry and hence is revisited in this paper. This paper presents an experimental study carried out {{to examine the effects}} of the thickness of mortar joints, the type of mortar adhesives and the presence of web shells in the hollow concrete masonry prisms under axial compression. A non-contact digital image correlation technique was used to measure the deformation of the prisms and was found adequate for the determination of strain fi eld of the loaded face shells subjected to axial compression. It is found that the absence of end web shells lowers the compressive strength and stiffness of the prisms and the thinner and <b>higher</b> <b>adhesive</b> mortars increase the compressive strength and stiffness, while lowering the Poisson's ratio. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2013...|$|R

40|$|Nature {{has long}} {{served as a}} source of {{inspiration}} for scientists and engineers to design and construct multifunctional artificial materials. The lotus and the peanut are two typical plants living in the aquatic and the arid (or semiarid) habitats, respectively, which have evolved different optimized solutions to survive. For the lotus leaf, an air layer is formed between its surface and water, exhibiting a discontinuous three-phase contact line, which resulted in the low adhesive superhydrophobic self-cleaning effect to avoid the leaf decomposition. In contrast to the lotus leaf, the peanut leaf shows high-adhesive superhydrophobicity, arising from the formation of the quasi-continuous and discontinuous three-phase contact line at the microscale and nanoscale, respectively, which provides a new avenue for the fabrication of <b>high</b> <b>adhesive</b> superhydrophobic materials.
