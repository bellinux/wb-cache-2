5|$|Cloud Gate is {{described}} as a transformative, iconic work. It is similar to many of Kapoor's previous works in the themes and issues it addresses. While the sculpture's mirror effects are reminiscent of fun-house fairground mirrors, they also have a more serious intent; they help dematerialize this very large object, making it seem light and almost weightless. Cloud Gate is considered Kapoor's most ambitious use of complex mirrored form dynamics. Kapoor challenges his viewers to <b>internalize</b> his work through intellectual and theoretical exercise. By reflecting the sky, visiting and non-visiting pedestrians and surrounding architecture, Cloud Gate limits its viewers to partial comprehension at any time. The interaction with the viewer who moves to create his own vision gives it a spiritual dimension. The sculpture {{is described}} as a disembodied, luminous form, which is also how his earlier 1000 Names (197980) was described when it addressed the metaphysical and mystical.|$|E

This cross-sectional, survey recruited adult patients (n= 280) who were seeking treatment at outpatient and affiliated clinics of the only tertiary psychiatric hospital in Singapore. <b>Internalized</b> stigma was measured using the <b>Internalized</b> Stigma of Mental Illness scale. 43. 6 % experienced moderate to high <b>internalized</b> stigma.

In the final regression model, which included all psychosocial variables together, self-esteem was the only variable significantly and negatively associated with <b>internalized</b> stigma.

Results indicated that parents of children with <b>internalizing</b> symptomology displayed statistically significantly poorer parenting behaviors than did parents of children who were free of <b>internalizing</b> symptoms. Two parenting styles were statistically significantly correlated with <b>internalizing</b> symptoms in children: Overreactivity and lax parenting styles. No significant interaction was noted among gender, <b>internalizing</b> symptomology, and parenting practices.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{a great deal of}} {{research}} has been devoted to the understanding of <b>internalizing</b> disorders in children. <b>Internalizing</b> disorders encompass a wide variety of problems, including depression, anxiety, social withdrawal, and somatic complaints. It has been suggested that the existence of <b>internalizing</b> disorders in children has negative effects upon their self-esteem, academic achievement, physical health, and future adjustment. However, because <b>internalizing</b> disorders are, in great measure, subjective perceptions of internal distress, they are often not readily or reliably identified by external observers. As a result, several researchers have stressed the importance of eliciting the child 2 ̆ 7 s perspective through self-report assessment. While there are several excellent self-report measures of <b>internalizing</b> constructs, none of these instruments is designed to measure the comprehensive domain of <b>internalizing</b> disorders in children below the age of 11 even though it has been established that children as young as 8 are able to give reliable self-reports. This apparent dearth of broad-based instruments for middle- to late-elementary school children creates problems for the assessment of <b>internalizing</b> problems because the various <b>internalizing</b> syndromes often coexist with one another, therefore limiting the utility of a single-syndrome instrument. The newly developed <b>Internalizing</b> Symptoms Scale for Children (ISSC) is a 48 - item self-report instrument designed to measure the broad range of <b>internalizing</b> problems in children.

25|$|Congenital amusia, {{commonly}} known as tone deafness, refers to a musical disability that cannot be explained by prior brain lesion, hearing loss, cognitive defects, or lack of environmental stimulation, and it affects about 4% of the population. Individuals who suffer from congenital amusia seem to lack the musical predispositions with which most people are born. They are unable to recognize or hum familiar tunes {{even if they have}} normal audiometry and above-average intellectual and memory skills. Also, they do not show sensitivity to dissonant chords in a melodic context, which, as discussed earlier, is one of the musical predispositions exhibited by infants. The hallmark of congenital amusia is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination, and this deficit is most apparent when congenital amusics are asked to pick out a wrong note in a given melody. If the distance between two successive pitches is small, congenital amusics are not able to detect a pitch change. As a result of this defect in pitch perception, a lifelong musical impairment may emerge due to a failure to <b>internalize</b> musical scales. A lack of fine-grained pitch discrimination makes it extremely difficult for amusics to enjoy and appreciate music, which consists largely of small pitch changes.|$|E

Economic analysis of recycling {{does not include}} what economists call externalities, which are unpriced costs and benefits that accrue to individuals outside of private transactions.

40|$|Background: The {{relationship}} between early adverse life events and later <b>internalizing</b> problems could be mediated by DNA methylation. Adversity {{has been associated}} with higher methylation levels in the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR 3 C 1) and the serotonin transporter gene (SLC 6 A 4) in adolescents. We investigated cross-sectional and prospective associations of NR 3 C 1 and SLC 6 A 4 methylation with adolescents' clinical diagnoses of <b>internalizing</b> disorders and <b>internalizing</b> symptom scores. Methods: In a population sample (mean age= 162) we measured DNA methylation in three regions of NR 3 C 1 (NR 3 C 1 _ 1, N= 454; NR 3 C 1 _ 2, N= 904; NR 3 C 1 _ 3, N= 412) and one region of SLC 6 A 4 (N= 939) at baseline. <b>Internalizing</b> problems were operaLionalized as clinical DSM-IV diagnoses, assessed at 3 year follow-up with a diagnostic interview, and <b>internalizing</b> symptom scores, assessed with Self Report questionnaires at baseline and follow-up. Results: Only NR 3 C 1 _ 1 methylation was positively associated with risk of lifetime <b>internalizing</b> disorders, and with symptom scores at follow-up. However, after accounting for baseline symptom scores there was only a tendency for association with <b>internalizing</b> symptom scores at follow-up. There was no association between SLC 6 A 4 methylation and risk of lifetime <b>internalizing</b> disorders. SLC 6 A 4 methylation and <b>internalizing</b> symptom scores showed a tendency for association, also after accounting for baseline symptom scores. Limitations: There was no repeated measure of DNA methylation to study causality between methylation and <b>internalizing</b> problems. Gene expression data were not available. Conclusions: Although the role of gene methylation in the development of <b>internalizing</b> problems remains unclear, our findings suggest that gene methylation, particularly of NR 3 C 1, may be involved in the development of <b>internalizing</b> problems in adolescence.

Minimal research has explored the heritability of <b>internalizing</b> difficulties or self-esteem within preschool-aged children, and no studies have done so while also considering parenting behaviors. Thus, the present study investigated the heritability of self-esteem and <b>internalizing</b> symptoms and examined the relations between self-esteem, <b>internalizing</b> symptoms, and parenting behaviors within preschool-aged twins. Data were collected from 61 twin pairs at the ages of 4 and 5. Parenting behavior data were obtained from parent-child interactions that took place in a lab setting when the twins were 4 years old. At age 5, twins were administered a self-report measure of self-esteem and parents completed a measure of <b>internalizing</b> symptoms. Results indicated that <b>internalizing</b> symptoms were significantly heritable but self-esteem was not, although there was some support for the presence of budding genetic influences for self-esteem. Self-esteem and <b>internalizing</b> symptoms were significantly positively related within one sub-sample of twins and were not significantly correlated within the replication sub-sample. Interestingly, self-esteem and <b>internalizing</b> symptoms were not significant predictors of each other above and beyond genetic influences. Parenting behavior was not significantly related to either self-esteem or <b>internalizing</b> symptoms. Results showed that children who over-rated their peer-related competence tended to have more <b>internalizing</b> symptoms than those who under-rated or realistically rated themselves in this domain.
