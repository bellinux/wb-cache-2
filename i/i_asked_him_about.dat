5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E

[...] And then the tablet was left to Mother Nature and to the silence which is only broken by the soughing of the breeze through the branches and the music of the bee and the katydid [...] Only the wanderer in the hills or the devout pilgrim seeking out shrines of song will find the tablet on the oak. “Dan O ’Connell loved God ’s out-of-doors, ” said Peters when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the memorial [...] “He delighted in life in the open [...] He was an excellent shot, a skilled fly fisher and an expert yachtsman [...] So it seemed right to commemorate him in the hills and among the trees.” ...|$|E
500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit." [...] In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: [...] "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got , we were both part of a [...] "futures group"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen." [...] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: [...] "I didn't ask him about the Internet. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day." ...|$|E

60|$|I saw {{something}} white a mile {{off on the}} water, {{which turned out to}} be a great gull on a rock, which the Indian would have been glad to kill and eat. But it flew away long before we were near; and also a flock of summer ducks that were about the rock with it. <b>I</b> <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> herons, since this was Heron Lake, he said that he found the blue heron's nests in the hard-wood trees.|$|R
2500|$|.....his mood {{changed to}} anger when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Gustave Whitehead. He flatly {{refused to talk}} about Whitehead, and when I asked him why, he said: 'That SOB never paid me what he owed me. My father had a hauling {{business}} and I often hitched up the horses and helped Whitehead take his airplane to {{where he wanted to}} go. I will never give Whitehead credit for anything. I did a lot of work for him and he never paid me a dime.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Corgan commented, [...] "Like a {{great artist}} can do, Shepard had summed up very simply a lot of complex themes. He also used the type font from our very first single, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it {{and he had no}} idea. He was just on point." [...] Fairey also remarked [...] "I use red {{frequently}} because it is a visually powerful, emotionally potent color. Red gets people's attention. In this case there is the added possibility that the red liquid could be blood, giving it an even more sinister sense of foreboding." [...] The red color of the artwork was changed for most of the special edition releases. The Best Buy reissue features a black-and-white version of the original artwork.|$|E
2500|$|Razzak was {{the only}} Bangladeshi {{to play in the}} 2008 Indian Premier League making him the first Bangladeshi to play the league. He was bought for $50,000 by the Royal Challengers Bangalore and played in only one match. Despite not playing often for the team, Razzak {{believed}} that the experience he gained from the tournament was important. He stated that Anil Kumble [...] "was very helpful when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> bowling in Test matches. He told me that given my bowling approach, {{it is very important to}} use variations within my line and length. Actually, captains would want a breakthrough from me so without using variations, wickets are hard to come by. Coach Venkatesh Prasad was also a great help".|$|E
60|$|Not to make Joe uneasy {{by talking}} too much, even if I {{had been able}} to talk much, <b>I</b> {{deferred}} <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Miss Havisham until next day. He shook his head when <b>I</b> then <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if she had recovered.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{hope the}} {{governor}} {{will soon be}} here, anyway. There {{are a lot of}} things <b>I</b> want to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear," [...] said Dr. Domb to Judge Ponderus, [...] "that Blinks {{has hardly}} profited by {{his time in}} Europe {{as much as he}} ought to have.

And he was there a month!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{said his}} sister, [...] "I {{strongly}} suspect something {{wrong about the}} boys. Fergus was very odd and silent last night when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Jem Horner's picnic, and he said something about that Harewood cousin being an unmitigated brute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur Bertram {{tells me}} {{you want to come}} with me as a servant, Pierre; but when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> you, he does not give you such a {{character}} as one would naturally require in a confidential servant. Is there anyone who will speak for you?" ...|$|E
60|$|As we went along, {{partly to}} hold him in conversation, and partly to satisfy myself, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Ham. He said, almost in the same words as formerly, that Ham was just the same, 'wearing away his life with kiender no care nohow for 't; but never murmuring, and liked by all'.|$|E
60|$|I {{was glad}} to have some company, and tried to get him conversing; but found he was the most stupid and ignorant boy I had ever met with. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> the river Thames; when he said that he hadn't traveled any in America and didn't know any thing about the rivers here. And when I told him the river Thames was in England, he showed no surprise or shame at his ignorance, but only looked ten times more stupid than before.|$|R
5000|$|I have a theory, {{but it is}} only a theory. The Interlinguist/Occidentalist Ilmari Federn, {{who later}} adopted the name Charles Sprague and came to live in England in the late 1930s, worked at the [...] "Financial Times" [...] in London. I think in the {{newspaper}} press. It is possible that he added the text in Interlingue to the standard Lorem ipsum passage. Unfortunately, <b>I</b> never <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> this when <b>I</b> got to know him in the latter years of his life, in the early 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|I had {{to fill in}} a form: name, address, {{telephone}} number and then religion. I had several lessons there with a guy called Bill Blake, and <b>I</b> kept <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> membership. Eventually he turned round to me and said, [...] "Look, Angela, please don't keep asking me, you're {{not going to be}} able to join the club." [...] I said, [...] "Why not? I'm not good enough?" [...] "No, because you're Jewish." [...] And that was the beginning. It was the first time it (prejudice) had hit me in this country.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is another}} of Father's mysteries. When <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it {{he said that it}} was perhaps the most {{valuable}} thing he had, except one. When I asked him what that one was, he refused to tell me, and forbade me to ask him anything concerning it. 'I will tell you,' he said, 'all about it, too, in good time--if I live!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> his relatives, {{and neither}} he nor she had any. [...] "We have a friend--" [...] he began and paused, and then rambled into a not very {{understandable}} story about a letter and a doll's house and some unknown man who had bought one of his pictures, or {{was supposed to have}} done so, in a curiously clandestine manner. I could not quite follow the story.|$|E
60|$|I {{wanted to}} see him do more miracles; and so, just for the {{pleasure}} of hearing him answer, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Hertzegovina, and pariah, and unique. But he began to generalize then, and show distress. I saw that with New Zealand gone, he was a Samson shorn of his locks; he was as other men. This was a curious and interesting mystery, and I was frank with him, and asked him to explain it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only once; {{but that}} time near ended me. It were {{a long time}} ago, an' he was sorry, I guess, 'cause he bought me a new dress nex' day--an' new shoes! I ain't had any since," [...] she added disconsolately, [...] "so the other day <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> wasn't it <b>about</b> time he choked me ag'in." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{found the}} family-tree-man, {{whose name was}} Brandish, {{in a small room}} not too clean, over a shop not far from St. Paul's Churchyard. He had another business, which related to patent poison for flies, and at first he thought I had come to see <b>him</b> <b>about</b> that, but when he found out <b>I</b> wanted to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> my family tree his face brightened up.|$|R
5000|$|While {{working on}} the NFB {{documentary}} film, Inside Fighting Canada (1942), Marsh met fellow filmmaker James Beveridge who later became a war correspondent in the Royal Canadian Air Force, serving in Europe from 1944-1945. Jane, recently divorced, and with a son, D'Arcy, married James Beveridge after the Second World War but their marriage was short-lived. [...] According to Beveridge's daughter, he recounted that [...] "I think Jane couldn't resist a man in an aviator's jacket. They had a brief and disastrous marriage after the war was over. When <b>I</b> once <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it, Dad told me that 'they were both too nutty' and so they went their separate ways." ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the {{destruction}} of the mission station, but although he was half-drunk, on this point he remained very close. All he would say was that he had heard that twenty years ago the people called the Mazitu, who were very fierce, had raided right down to the coast and killed those who dwelt there, except a white man and his wife who had fled inland and never been seen again.|$|E
6000|$|He {{is a funny}} old man. He must {{be awfully}} old, for his face is gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He {{tells me that he}} is nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing fleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical person, for when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the bells at sea and the White Lady at the abbey he said very brusquely, ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Rezu. He {{answered}} {{that he was}} a dreadful person, undying, it was said, like She-who-commands, though he had never seen the man himself and never wanted to do so. His followers being cannibals and having literally eaten up all those that they could reach, were now desirous of conquering the people of Lulala that they might eat them also at their leisure. Each other they did not eat, because dog does not eat dog, and therefore they were beginning to grow hungry, although they had plenty of grain and cattle of which they used the milk and hides.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{yet they}} say he is very worthy. <b>I</b> have <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> {{and he is not}} a bad fellow. He keeps his money and has ideas of living decently. He doesn't drink or gamble. But he's not a gentleman or {{anything}} like one. I should think he never opens a book. Of course it would be a degradation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The secrecy of {{his nature}} seems even to have {{infected}} that skipper with--or rather by--whom he was wrecked," [...] continued Leather, [...] "for when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> yesterday <b>about</b> the old gentleman, he became suddenly silent, and when I pressed him, {{he made me}} a rigmarole speech something like this: `Young man, I make it a rule to know nothin' whatever about my passengers. As I said only two days past to my missus: [...] "Maggie," [...] says I, [...] "it's of no use your axin' me. My passengers' business is their business, and my business is mine. All I've {{got to do is}} to sail my ship, an' see to it that I land my passengers in safety."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{except that}} I couldn't get Mr. Valborg {{to say a}} word. <b>I</b> wanted to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the suit Mr. Hicks is making for my husband. But he insisted on singing. Still, it was restful, {{floating}} around {{on the water and}} singing. So happy and innocent. Don't you think it's a shame, Mrs. Bogart, that people in this town don't do more nice clean things like that, instead of all this horrible gossiping?" ...|$|R
