40|$|The TerraSAR-X {{launched}} on June 15, 2007 {{is one of}} the most state of the art satellite sensors. Its sophisticated feature is in demand for the application for map generation and monitoring purposes. One of the basic products of TerraSAR-X is the Enhanced Ellipsoid Corrected (EEC) orthorectified image. The product is projected to map geometry and terrain induced distortions are corrected using a digital elevation model (DEM). The geometric accuracy of this product depends on the referred DEM. In this study, we evaluated the pixel location accuracy of the product by two methods. The method using corner reflectors shows that the pixel location accuracy of SSC product was better than 1 meter, and that of <b>EEC</b> <b>product</b> was better than 5 meter in the flat area. On the contrast, the pixel location accuracy of the mountain areas evaluated by comparison with digital maps was reduced. It reveals that the enhancement of the orthorectified product is necessary for considering the creation of the topographic maps using TerraSAR-X data. 1...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{high-resolution}} commercial SAR satellites {{with several}} meters of resolutions are widely utilized for various applications and disaster monitoring {{is one of}} the commonly applied areas. The information about the flooding situation and ground displacement was rapidly announced to the public after the Great East Japan Earthquake 2011. One of the studies reported the displacement in Tohoku region by the pixel matching methodology using both pre- and post- event TerraSAR-X data, and the validated accuracy was about 30 cm at the GEONET reference points. In order to discuss the spatial distribution of the displacement, we need to evaluate the relative accuracy of the displacement in addition to the absolute accuracy. In the previous studies, our study team evaluated the absolute 2 D geo-location accuracy of the TerraSAR-X ortho-rectified <b>EEC</b> <b>product</b> for both flat and mountain areas. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to evaluate the spatial and temporal relative geo-location accuracies of the product by considering the displacement of the fixed point as the relative geo-location accuracy. Firstly, by utilizing TerraSAR-X StripMap dataset, the pixel matching method for estimating the displacement with sub-pixel level was developed. Secondly, the validity of the method was confirmed by comparing with GEONET data. We confirmed that the accuracy of the displacement for X and Y direction was in agreement with the previous studies. Subsequently, the methodology was applied to 20 pairs of data set for areas of Tokyo Ota-ku and Kawasaki-shi, and the displacement of each pair was evaluated. It was revealed that the time series displacement rate had the seasonal trend and seemed to be related to atmospheric delay...|$|E
40|$|Branch of RAS {{within the}} {{framework}} of the target program of the fundamental interdisciplinary researches, which are carried out in common with scientists of the Ural, Siberian, and Far East Branches of RAS, and {{within the framework}} of the Com-plex Program of the Presidium of RAS “Investigations of Substance at Extremal Conditions”. Abstract – Mechanisms of conductor fracture and generation of nanosized metal particles at electric explosion (EEC) are discussed. It was determined that fracture of polycrystalline conductors with crystallite size less than 100 nm at fast input of electromagnetic energy occurs in consequence of its localization in area of intercrystalline boundaries. Within the framework of the mechanics of hetero-geneous media in view of processes of condensation and evaporation the dynamics of the <b>EEC</b> <b>products</b> (of the vapor-droplet mixtures) expansion in buffer gas was numerically investigated. The distributions of particles on the sizes received as a result of simu-lation qualitatively and quantitatively correlate with the experimental distributions. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Enterprise Electronics Corporation or EEC is an Alabama-based {{commercial}} {{weather radar}} system company, founded in 1971.

40|$|The {{presence}} of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and plasmidic AmpC (pAmpC) producing Escherichia coli (EEC) in food animals, especially broilers, {{has become a}} major public health concern. The aim {{of the present study was}} to quantify the EEC exposure of humans in The Netherlands through the consumption of meat from different food animals. Calculations were done with a simplified Quantitative Microbiological Risk Assessment (QMRA) model. The model took the effect of pre-retail processing, storage at the consumers home and preparation in the kitchen (cross-contamination and heating) on EEC numbers on/in the raw meat products into account. The contribution of beef products (78 %) to the total EEC exposure of the Dutch population through the consumption of meat was much higher than for chicken (18 %), pork (4. 5 %), veal (0. 1 %) and lamb (0 %). After slaughter, chicken meat accounted for 97 % of total EEC load on meat, but chicken meat experienced a relatively large effect of heating during food preparation. Exposure via consumption of filet americain (a minced beef product consumed raw) was predicted to be highest (61 % of total EEC exposure), followed by chicken fillet (13 %). It was estimated that only 18 % of EEC exposure occurred via cross-contamination during preparation in the kitchen, which was the only route by which EEC survived for surface-contaminated products. Sensitivity analysis showed that model output is not sensitive for most parameters. However, EEC concentration on meat other than chicken meat was an important data gap. In conclusion, the model assessed that consumption of beef products led to a higher exposure to <b>EEC</b> than chicken <b>products,</b> although the prevalence of EEC on raw chicken meat was much higher than on beef. The (relative) risk of this exposure for public health is yet unknown given the lack of a modelling framework and of exposure studies for other potential transmission routes...|$|R
