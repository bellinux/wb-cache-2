40|$|This study explores <b>the</b> {{interaction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> "good teacher" and <b>the</b> "image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child" {{by comparing}} standard, Montessori, Waldorf and Reggio Emilia educational models. <b>The</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child vary among these educational models (Kramer, this volume). Cruickshank and Haefele (2001) defined ten <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> good teacher. Different <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> good teacher {{were found in}} the educational models, but not all aspects reflecting <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> good teacher in the educational models were covered by the framework utilized and some images partially overlapped one another. Because <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> good teacher and child are related, they should be defined together as <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teacher-child interaction. Implications for future research are discussed...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the images and local elements applied in design, {{the capacity of the}} buildings, the nature of the space, the potential of the neighboring districts, the convenience of the traffic square, and the contrast of vertical and horizontal volumes of the buildings that constitute the skyline are all considered. The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations. Therefore, the contrast created by the vertical volumes of the supporting structures can characterize the space and enhance the <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> architecture in the surroundings. The images of the supporting facilities are suggestive, and the <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stations is revealing.|$|E
