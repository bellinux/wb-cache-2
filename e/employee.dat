5|$|Heffernan v. City of Paterson, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court case in 2016 {{concerning}} the First Amendment rights of public employees.

5|$|If an <b>employee</b> {{does make}} such a disclosure, Section 2 inserts a new Section 47B, {{providing}} that the <b>employee</b> shall suffer no detriment in their employment as a result.

If an <b>employee</b> does suffer a detriment, he is permitted to make a complaint before an employment tribunal under Section 3. In front of an employment tribunal, the law is amended in Sections 4 and 5 to provide compensation, and to reverse the burden of proof; if an <b>employee</b> has been dismissed for making a protected disclosure, this dismissal is automatically considered unfair. Similarly, under Section 6, an <b>employee</b> cannot be given priority when discussing redundancies simply because he made such a disclosure. These sections take into account Section 7, which notes that there is no requirement of age or length of employment before they come into effect.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} attitudes towards older <b>employees,</b> perceived age discrimination, and HR practices (personnel development and reward) in 240 <b>employees.</b> Attitudes toward older <b>employees</b> were largely positive, thus supporting {{the notion that}} attitudes toward older <b>employees</b> are becoming increasingly positive. Older employees' attitudes towards older <b>employees</b> were more positive, but younger employees' attitudes were still favorable. Moreover, older and younger <b>employees</b> reported benefiting from HR measures, such as training, to a similar extent. Also, older <b>employees</b> did not feel more discriminated against than younger <b>employees</b> did, indicating that employees' attitudes were in line with HR practices. Nevertheless, some results suggested that HR practices preferred younger to older <b>employees,</b> indicating that in some domains of personnel development and reward, positive attitudes toward older <b>employees</b> do not necessarily parallel organizational practices...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} health on working conditions and outcomes. METHODS: Data were collected in the longitudinal Study on Health at Work (n = 1597 <b>employees),</b> using multiple regression analyses and focusing on three groups of employees: 1) healthy, 2) chronic health complaints without a work handicap, and 3) chronic health complaints with a work handicap. RESULTS: 1) <b>Employees</b> with a work handicap experienced less favorable working conditions and outcomes than other <b>employees.</b> 2) <b>Employees</b> with a work handicap experienced less favorable working conditions and outcomes over time. 3) <b>Employees</b> with chronic health complaints were more vulnerable to the influence of working conditions on outcomes, whereas <b>employees</b> with a work handicap, unexpectedly, benefited from high work pressure and low autonomy. CONCLUSION: 1) <b>Employees</b> with a work handicap differ considerably from <b>employees</b> with chronic health complaints. 2) <b>Employees</b> with a work handicap drift into less favorable working conditions and outcomes. 3) Healthy <b>employees,</b> <b>employees</b> with chronic health complaints, and <b>employees</b> with a work handicap, all are vulnerable to different working conditions. © 2009 The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine...|$|R
