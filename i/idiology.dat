40|$|The {{freedom of}} mass media after reformation gives {{stimulus}} to Mass Medias now days. One {{of them is the}} news of region government election at many regions which have done their election. North Sumatra is one of region in Indonesia which has done an election at middle of April 2008. This event is much reported by mass medias {{and one of them is}} Suara Hidayatullah. At May 2008 edition, Suara Hidayatullah makes the election of governance at North Sumatra as a headline at their rubric and their primary report. That is the background why does the researcher wants to know how the construction that build by Suara Hidayatullah trough the news of governor and vice governor election at North Sumatra. This observation wants to know more about how mass media, in this case, Suara Hidayatullah did the construction by ideologist on the news. Mass media is a provider of realita, the organizers {{of mass media}}s as if a cook which proced an event to be a news at their mass medias to be presented to society. As the idially of mass media is conveyor of information. In this congeniality hence media meant only reflecting fact that happened into their news. However in the reality mass media is not only in ideal level, mass media is not only presenting fact that happened, but olso giving meaning to the event. So the society does not give their perception to one event that is presented in mass media by themselves, but the media also try to give meaning to one event accomodated by their <b>idiology.</b> That seems so real when we see the mass medias of alternative in presenting the news. As a mass media complement of meanstream mass media the viewpoints shown are very different. It is because the mass media alternative brings their <b>idiology</b> trough their news in one event. In 1950 s these mass medias appears just to be participator which to be tool of <b>idiology</b> of political party but now mass media to be tools of certain institution or a group of people. Islamic mass media seems very real in showing their religious sosiology like Sabili, Suara Hidayatullah, saksi, Syr’ah and other islamic mass medias. Observation methodology that used by the researcher in this Observation is a qualitative observation methodology by using analyses framing Zhongdan Pan and Gerald M Kosicki tehnique. This reserach philosophy based on assumption that media is never free of value. Media have revided in nueteral condition in all its news. Mass medias always has their own viewpoint in seeing an event happened and absolutly based on their <b>idiology.</b> In Zhongdan Pan and Gerald M Kosicki analyses framing, there are four discourse elements used to make an analyses. those elements are; syntax, skrip, tematik and retoris. Those four elements are used to research a news of mass media start from news schema aspect until the choice of words that used in a news. In one of research about suara hidayatullah framing trough the news of governor and vice governor election in north Sumatra found that suara hidayatullah has framed this news as tools of ideological spreading to avoid a region leader of non Moslem in a Moslem majority area. The election on governor and vice governor do not see as a leader changing of political process but as challeng of moslem and crist domination. Suara hidayatullah develop its discourse at cristian movement issues trough political case. The Christian candidate in taking part on the election of head governance considered as one of effort to make a movement. From perspective of hierarchy theory self interest of shoemaker and D. Reese known that that thing is influenced by self interest of ideology from its media which brings Islamic ideology that carrying the straightening of Islam in nation and state...|$|E
