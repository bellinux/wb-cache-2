[...] He said, [...] "Everything I did was focused on making good music and being a great musician, not running a business. Yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses." [...] But some artists just want to [...] be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both. [...] Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants. [...] He advises, [...] "...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time. [...] All the <b>information</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything." [...] He explains, [...] "Time and persistence has shown me that I can succeed at sharing my art with others as a musician while running my own music business. [...] And that kind of success is as good as I could have ever wished for." ...|$|E

After the briefing, Pelosi said she [...] "was assured by lawyers with the CIA and the Department of Justice that the methods were legal." [...] Two unnamed former Bush Administration officials say that the briefing was detailed and graphic, {{and at the time}} she didn't raise substantial objections. One unnamed U.S. official present during the early briefings said, [...] "In fairness, the environment was different then because we were closer to September 11 and people were still in a panic. But there was no objecting, no hand-wringing. The attitude was, 'We don't care what you do to those guys as long as you get the <b>information</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to protect the American people.' [...] " ...|$|E

Clarke accurately predicted many things that became reality, including online banking, online shopping, and other now commonplace things. Responding {{to a question about}} how the interviewer's son's life would be different, Clarke responded: [...] "He will have, in his own house, not a computer as big as this, , but at least, a console through which he can talk, through his local computer and get all the information he needs, for his everyday life, like his bank statements, his theatre reservations, all the <b>information</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> in the course of living in our complex modern society, this will be in a compact form in his own house... and he will take it as much for granted as we take the telephone." ...|$|E

The day after to-morrow the moon is full, and at midnight you must go to the spot and get the stone out of the wall with a pickaxe. Under the stone lies a great treasure, which has been hidden there in time of war. Besides church plate, you will find bags of money, which have been lying in this place for over a hundred years, and no one knows to whom it all belongs. A third of this money you must give to the poor, but the rest you may keep for yourself.' As he finished, the cocks in the village crowed, and the little man was nowhere to be seen. Hans found that his limbs no longer pained him, and lay for some time thinking of the hidden treasure. Towards morning he fell asleep.|$|E
