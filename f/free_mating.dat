40|$|Malaria is {{a serious}} public health problem, the control of which {{involves}} actions directed against its vector, mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles Meigan, 1818. The study of insect biology, ecology, and behavior is simplified when these insects are maintained at the laboratory. However, many of the species are eurygamic and require induced mating. Females of Anopheles marajoara Galva˜o e Damasceno, 1942 were collected at Mazaga˜o county, State of Amapa´, Brazil. F 1 eggs were obtained through forced oviposition and raised until mosquito emergence. Around 300 mosquitoes were maintained in each cage and were fed with a 10 % sugar solution. Induced mating was made to obtain the other generations. Females had their spermathecae examined {{for the presence of}} sperm. The efficacy of coupling in each generation was evaluated. The viability of a sample of generations F 5, F 9, F 12, and F 14 was followed from larvae to adult. Two <b>free</b> <b>mating</b> attempts were done. The results demonstrate adaptation of An. marajoara to laboratory conditions over 21 generations, with viability rates temporally increasing.

Our study focused on 350 ewes OD aged from 2 to 6 years and divided into two groups:-A: 300 ewes maintained at the farm Bouchebaa, rely on free mating-B: 50 ewes maintained at the CNIAAG - Biskra. Zootechnical performance are lower in-group B (fertility rate = 101 % vs 66 %, fertility rates = 86. 70 % vst 64 % and prolificacy rate = 116, 54 % vs 103 %, respectively for <b>free</b> <b>mating</b> vs AI); for the last two parameters, this difference was significant (p < 0. 02). Concerning the success factors of AI, the statistical analysis revealed no significant difference, at the age (9 months, 3, 4 or 6) or class (yearling or adult) ram used for the seed harvest. In conclusion, we can say that the success rate of AI will never be similar to natural reproduction. Therefore, those farmers continue to show a limited interest for this technique. It should be noted that to date, the success rate recorded at AI sheep centers in Algeria vary from 46 to 76 %.

40|$|Research on mate choice has {{primarily}} {{focused on}} preferences for quality indicators, assuming that all individuals show consensus {{about who is}} the most attractive. However, in some species, mating preferences seem largely individual-specific, suggesting that they might target genetic or behavioral compatibility.

Here, we report on an experiment that controls for variation in overall partner quality and show that zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) pairs that resulted from <b>free</b> <b>mate</b> choice achieved a 37 % higher reproductive success than pairs that were forced to mate. Cross-fostering of freshly laid eggs showed that embryo mortality (before hatching) primarily depended on {{the identity of the}} genetic parents, whereas offspring mortality during the rearing period depended on foster-parent identity.

40|$|Abstract] This {{thesis is}} aimed at better {{understanding}} of cytotype co-existence in mixed- ploidy populations {{with an emphasis on}} a microevolutionary processes behind it. Our past knowledge was based on a few thoroughly investigated model taxa like Chamerion angustifolium and Heuchera grossulariifolia, but some generalizations seem to be premature in the light of new findings. A detailed research of other taxa included in the thesis showed that polyploid complexes can vary dramatically in their ability to cope with the co-existence of cytotypes in mixed-ploidy popu- lations. Whereas mixed-ploidy populations are virtually lacking in some species (an example being Vicia cracca, Paper III.), ploidy-heterogeneous populations are very common in others, maintained by <b>free</b> <b>mating</b> interactions and the absence of reproductive isolation among cytotypes (e. g. Pilosella echioides, Paper II.). The strenght and cumulative effect of various breeding barriers (both pre- or post- zygotic) govern the position of a particular multi-ploidy complex between these two extremes and co-determine the type of cytotype co-existence in its mixed- ploidy populations. Despite the fact that the number of studies revealing cytotype co-existence has been increasing rapidly, evolutionary background and consequences of such co- [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{select the}} most {{effective}} parameters of electroacupuncture (EA) at Hegu (LI 4) and Sanyinjiao (SP 6), a traditional acupuncture formula that induces labor, by comparing its effects on uterine contraction in late-stage pregnant rats, so as to improve the effects of acupuncture on induction of labor and its clinical maneuverability and {{provide the basis for}} further mechanism research. Methods: One hundred and eight female healthy adult Wistar rats were randomly divided into eight groups including one non-pregnancy control group (normal control group) and seven pregnant groups. Pregnant rats were prepared by <b>free</b> <b>mating</b> and vaginal plugs observation method and were randomly divided into six EA groups and one no EA group (model group) according to the requirements of a 2 × 3 factorial design. EA parameters included 2 types of waves (continuous wave and sparse-dense wave) and 3 types of frequency (15, 30 and 50 Hz). Rats in treatment groups received EA on bilateral LI 4 for 20 min and then bilateral SP 6 for 5 min with certain parameters accordingly. Each acupoint and a nearby non-acupoint at the proximal end (2 to 3 mm from the acupoint) were connected with two leads of one EA line. The current intensity of EA was 0. 2 to 0. 3 mA. A muscle tension transducer and the BL- 420 Biological Experimental System were placed on the lower uterine segment of rats for detecting contractility, frequency and lasting-time of contraction wave. Results: Compared with non-pregnancy control group, the amplitude, frequency and lasting time of contraction waves of uterine contraction in all EA groups and model group were significantly increased. Compared with control group, amplitudes of contraction waves of uterine contraction of both EA 1 group (15 Hz continuous wave) and EA 6 group (2 / 50 Hz sparse-dense wave) were significantly increased (P 0. 05), but the mean value of EA 6 group was higher than that of EA 1 group; EA 6 group had significantly higher levels of lasting time of contraction waves of uterine contraction than the other EA groups (P 0. 05), but the mean value of EA 6 group was higher than EA 1 group and EA 5 group. Conclusion: EA with sparse-dense wave (2 Hz sparse wave and 50 Hz dense wave, alternately) at LI 4 and SP 6 was more effective than other EA parameters for increasing uterine contraction amplitude, frequency, and lasting-time of contraction waves in late-stage pregnant rats. This combination of electric wave and frequency for EA at LI 4 and SP 6, a traditional acupuncture formula for inducing labor, is recommended to be applied in clinical practice for parturition as well as for treatment of uterine atony...|$|E

40|$|Behavioural ecologists aim at {{providing}} {{insights into}} the evolutionary and ecological processes that shape animal behaviour. Mate choice is a decision faced by most animals that can strongly affect an individual’s reproductive success, an important fitness component. This behaviour has therefore the potential to show many adaptations which {{have been the subject}} of a vivid research interest over the last decades. Studies on mate choice have typically focused on female preferences for traits that increase a male's overall attractiveness, which supposedly reflects the male’s absolute quality. Preferences for such traits are expected to provide females with benefits such as good paternal care or ‘good genes’ for their offspring. Nevertheless, in some species, individuals actually show little consensus on what represents a high-quality partner. Such individually-specific preferences are poorly understood, but it has been hypothesized that they have evolved to optimise genetic compatibility (to increase offspring viability) or, although rarely mentioned, to optimise behavioural compatibility (to facilitate joint parental care). The zebra finch is a life-time monogamous passerine whose mating preferences for putative quality traits have been widely studied but where no such quality indicator has been repeatedly shown to influence mating decisions. In this species, preferences seem instead largely idiosyncratic. In this thesis, I investigated whether female zebra finches choose genetically and/or behaviourally compatible social mates (Chapters 2 and 3). More precisely, I measured, in a large-scale breeding design, the fitness consequences of <b>free</b> <b>mate</b> choice for compatibility while experimentally controlling for effects of overall quality (Chapter 3). In this system, genetic incompatibility results in embryo mortality and therefore hatching failure, while behavioural incompatibility results in offspring mortality. I therefore expected social mate choice for genetic and/or behavioural compatibility to optimise embryo and offspring survival (Chapter 3). Moreover, I tested whether siblings who grew up together avoid choosing each other as social partner; in other words, if they avoid inbreeding depression by choosing a genetically more compatible partner (Chapter 2). In addition, I performed a meta-analysis of published experiments on zebra finches that allow for different mechanisms of kin discrimination to take place (Chapter 2). Finally, I investigated whether females enhance their extra-pair behaviour when paired to an apparently genetically incompatible male to obtain compatible genes benefits (Chapter 1). Indeed, extra-pair behaviour is largely hypothesized to be an adaptive response that would allow females to compensate for a potentially sub-optimal social mate choice. Specifically, I tested whether female extra-pair mating evolved as a counter strategy when females experience low hatching success with their social partner, that is to say whether female extra-pair mate choice targets fertility benefits and/or compatible genes benefits (Chapter 1). Contrary to all expectations derived from optimality, zebra finches were unable to identify partners with whom they would minimise embryo mortality (Chapter 3), or to recognize unfamiliar kin on the basis of genetic similarity per se to minimize inbreeding depression (meta-analysis of Chapter 2), and did not adjust their extra-pair mating behaviour in response to repeated hatching failure (Chapter 1). This suggests that, in zebra finches, individuals have not evolved any ability (other than avoiding familiar kin, experiment of Chapter 2) to judge genetic compatibility of any kind, despite the adaptive value of such behaviour. Finally, allowing <b>free</b> social <b>mate</b> choice did enhance pair fitness due to direct compatibility benefits (Chapter 3). This thesis provides therefore the first evidence of mate choice for behavioural compatibility. Nevertheless, the adaptive significance of the underlying choosiness remains speculative (Chapter 3). A null model consisting of random non-adaptive genetic variation in sensory systems and variation in phenotypes that are better at stimulating some sensory systems than others might well account for the observed fitness differences between compatible and incompatible pairs. This study highlights that there are limits to adaptation...|$|R

40|$|Inbreeding in {{hermaphroditic}} {{plants can}} occur through two different mechanisms: biparental inbreeding, when a plant mates with a related individual, or self-fertilization, when a plant mates with itself. To avoid inbreeding, many hermaphroditic plants have evolved self-incompatibility (SI) systems which prevent or limit self-fertilization. One particular SI system—homomorphic SI—can also reduce biparental inbreeding. Homomorphic SI {{is found in}} many angiosperm species, and it is often assumed that the additional benefit of reduced biparental inbreeding may {{be a factor in}} the success of this SI system. To test this assumption, we developed a spatially-explicit, individual-based simulation of plant populations that displayed three different types of homomorphic SI. We measured the total level of inbreeding avoidance by comparing each population to a self-compatible population (NSI), and we measured biparental inbreeding avoidance by comparing to a population of self-incompatible plants that were <b>free</b> to <b>mate</b> with any other individual (PSI). Because biparental inbreeding is more common when offspring dispersal is limited, we examined the levels of biparental inbreeding over a range of dispersal distances. We also tested whether the introduction of inbreeding depression affected the level of biparental inbreeding avoidance. We found that there was a statistically significant decrease in autozygosity in each of the homomorphic SI populations compared to the PSI population and, as expected, this was more pronounced when seed and pollen dispersal was limited. However, levels of homozygosity and inbreeding depression were not reduced. At low dispersal, homomorphic SI populations also suffered reduced female fecundity and had smaller census population sizes. Overall, our simulations showed that the homomorphic SI systems had little impact on the amount of biparental inbreeding in the population especially when compared to the overall reduction in inbreeding compared to the NSI population. With further study, this observation may have important consequences for research into the origin and evolution of homomorphic self-incompatibility systems...|$|R

40|$|Socially monogamous species {{vary widely}} in the {{frequency}} of extrapair offspring, but this is usually discussed assuming that females are <b>free</b> to express <b>mate</b> choice. Using game-theory modeling, we investigate the evolution of male mate guarding, and the relationship between paternity and mate-guarding intensity. We show that the relationship between evolutionarily stable mate-guarding behavior and the risk of cuckoldry can be complicated and nonlinear. Because male fitness accumulates both through paternity at his own nest and through his paternity elsewhere, males evolve to guard little either if females are very faithful or if they are very unfaithful. Attractive males are usually expected to guard less than unattractive males, but within-pair paternity may correlate either positively or negatively with the number of extrapair offspring fertilized by a male. Negative correlations, whereby attractive males are cuckolded more, become more likely if the reason behind female extrapair behavior applies to most females (e. g., fertility insurance) rather than the subset mated to unattractive males (e. g., when females seek "good genes") and if mate guarding is efficient in controlling female behavior. We discuss the current state of empirical knowledge with respect to these findings. Copyright 2005. extrapair paternity; mate guarding; self-consistent model; sexual conflict...|$|R

40|$|Behavior is a main {{component}} of sexual selection theory in which male competition and female mate choice influence {{the evolution of}} a species. Relatedness commonly affects behavioral interactions, but the potential for relatedness to influence sexual selection is often overlooked. Here I show that relatedness affects mating behaviors in satin bowerbirds. Bowerbirds are a model species for non-resource based mating systems in which males provide only sperm to females, and females are <b>free</b> to <b>mate</b> with their preferred males, typically resulting in high skews in male mating success. Males build stick structures (bowers) on the ground to attract, and copulate with, females. Males compete, in part, by destroying neighboring males' bowers. Females search among multiple adjacent bowers and then select subsets of these males for courtship and then copulation. Automated video monitoring of bowers allows identification of males that destroy bowers and females that visit bowers for courtship or copulation. Using microsatellite genetic markers to estimate relatedness, I show that paternity assignments based on observed copulations match the genetic sires of offspring, supporting the hypotheses that copulations occur only at bowers and that male reproductive success can be reliably estimated from observed copulations. Next, I report that competing males are less aggressive, in the form of bower destructions, towards relatives than non-relatives and that this restraining effect of relatedness on aggression favors the close spatial association of relatives' bowers. These results support the hypothesis that relatedness affects male competition and ability to maintain attractive displays for females. Lastly, I investigate the influence of relatedness on female mate choice. I show that females do not actively prefer or avoid relatives in mate choice. However, females bias the areas in which they search for mates to be inclusive of relatives and then mate randomly with respect to relatedness within their search areas, resulting in tendencies to mate with relatives in some years. This effect of relatedness on female mate searching may be {{due in part to the}} spatial association of related males, and highlights the influence of mate searching rather than active mate preferences on overall mate choice patterns...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} mate choice and {{polyandry}} on the reproductive performance and progeny fitness of a predaceous ladybird, Hippodamia variegata Goeze, was studied. The following mating combinations were used: (i) virgin female paired {{with the same}} and initially unmated male once per day (monogamy with limited mating), (ii) virgin female paired once daily with an unmated male (polyandry with no mate choice) and (iii) virgin female kept with five unmated males (polyandry with mate choice), with the food in each case an ad libitum supply of Aphis craccivora. Polyandrous females that had a <b>free</b> choice of <b>mates</b> were significantly more fecund (585. 50 ± 13. 80 eggs) and higher percentage of their eggs hatched (95. 32 ± 1. 99 %) than {{was the case for}} polyandrous females with no choice of mates (495. 20 ± 14. 25 eggs and 88. 81 ± 3. 29 %) followed by monogamous females (405. 00 ± 16. 20 eggs and 83. 13 ± 2. 07 %). Thus, mate choice and multiple mating by females is advantageous in terms of progeny production. The larvae that hatched from the eggs laid by these females were reared to maturity and their survival, duration of development and fitness determined. The fitness of offspring of polyandrous females (0. 4787 ± 0. 01) was better than that of polyandrous females that did not choose their mates (0. 4418 ± 0. 02) and monogamous (0. 4057 ± 0. 01) females. In addition, a greater percentage of the offspring of polyandrous females that chose their mates survived and developed faster than those of monogamous females with limited mating. These results reveal that polyandry with mate choice results in increased reproduction and better offspring quality. Hence, if one is interested increasing the production of H. variegata it is recommended that systems of production are developed that enable the females to be polyandrous and to select their mates...|$|R
