The dashboard was supplied by Veglia.|$|R
5000|$|Aviemore (UK, 1998): Base on the seven-seat GS model, the Aviemore {{had special}} badging and was {{available}} as either British Racing Green over beige cloth or Rioja Red over grey cloth. It was also equipped with dished alloy wheels and a <b>heated</b> <b>windscreen.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Zetec Climate (as Zetec, adds Quikclear <b>heated</b> front <b>windscreen)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The Luxury version {{came with}} a Quickclear <b>heated</b> <b>windscreen,</b> leather seats and {{interior}} trim as well as standard air conditioning. A 'Ka Blue' special edition was also launched in the UK with dark blue bumpers and a silvery-blue dashboard insert, rather than the standard models' silver. The Ka Sun Collection with a full-length fabric folding roof was also added to the range during the summer months.|$|R
5000|$|To {{this end}} Ford {{built on the}} already {{extensive}} specification available on the outgoing MkII Granada (which for the period, was very well equipped, with features such as leather heated electrically adjustable seats, air conditioning, electric sunroof and trip computer either standard or available as options) by adding some additional features unusual on a mass market car. Improvements available included: <b>heated</b> <b>windscreen,</b> cruise control and, later all-wheel drive.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} Phase 2 Safrane, Renault also offered a Safrane variant called the Questor which also {{relied on the}} Volvo powerplants {{mentioned}} above. The Questor differs only by having a factory fitted satellite navigation which is a Philips Carin 520 with infra-red remote control. This model was also fitted, {{at least in the}} United Kingdom market, with all the options available on the car as standard except the <b>heated</b> <b>windscreen</b> which was still an option.|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} {{production}} {{run of the}} Discovery II, only two models were offered {{for sale in the}} UK market, the 'base' Pursuit, which still retained a high level of equipment as standard, and the top specification Landmark, which offered an all-leather interior, twin sunroofs, Active Cornering Enhancement, six-disc CD player, and a <b>heated</b> <b>windscreen.</b> The final vehicles left the production lines in late May 2004 {{to make way for the}} all new Discovery 3 (LR3) models.|$|R
5000|$|To {{achieve its}} {{relatively}} high speed, the Blenheim used {{a very small}} fuselage cross-section, with its upper front glazing all at one angle {{in the form of}} a [...] "stepless cockpit" [...] that used no separate <b>windscreen</b> <b>panels</b> for the pilot, a notable feature of a substantial majority of German bomber designs, first conceived during the war years. Both fixed and sliding window panels were present, along with a transparent sliding roof. Other onboard equipment included a radio, cameras, navigation systems, electric lighting, oxygen apparatus, and stowage for parachutes and clothing.|$|R

2500|$|For the 2002 model year, further {{refinements}} {{were made to}} the Td5 engine to help it achieve ever-more stringent emission regulations. The [...] "XS" [...] 4x4 was introduced in 2002 as a top-specification level and the [...] "County" [...] package could be applied to every model in the line-up. XS models come with many [...] "luxury" [...] features, such as <b>heated</b> <b>windscreen,</b> <b>heated</b> seats, air conditioning, ABS and traction control and part-leather seats. [...] At the same time other detail improvements were made including a dash centre console, improved instrument illumination and the availability of front electric windows {{for the first time on}} a Defender. The design faults of the two-piece rear 4x4 door were finally eradicated with a one-piece door featuring a rubber weather sealing strip for the rear window.|$|R
500|$|The pilot's seat could {{actually}} be elevated, with the pilot's eyes above {{the level of the}} upper glazing, complete with a small pivoted <b>windscreen</b> <b>panel,</b> to get the pilot's head above the level of the top of the [...] "glass tunnel" [...] for a better forward view for takeoffs and landings. [...] The rear-facing dorsal gun position, enclosed with a sliding, near-clear view canopy, and for the first time, the ventral Bodenlafette rear-facing gun position, immediately aft of the bomb bay, that replaced the draggy [...] "dustbin" [...] retractable emplacement became standard, having been first flown on the He 111 V23, bearing civil registration D-ACBH.|$|R
50|$|<b>Heated</b> rear <b>windscreens</b> {{were now}} {{standard}} on all but base model sedans, panel vans and wagons. Nylon plaid cloth inserts available on SL's and wagons, air conditioning was now available as an optional accessory.|$|R
5000|$|The new tags {{are fairly}} large. On {{vehicles}} with metal lined <b>heat</b> reflective <b>windscreens,</b> the tag {{has to be}} placed in a [...] "zone" [...] near the rear view mirror which can be a distraction.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "Fashion Pack" [...] {{interior}} was now available on both sedan and coupe models, this option was also upgraded to add steel belted radials and a front stabilising bar. Door side impact beams {{were introduced to}} improve safety and SL coupes now had a <b>heated</b> rear <b>windscreen.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The fourth {{version of}} the Ford Escort was {{launched}} in March 1986, with {{only a small number}} of changes. Codenamed within Ford as [...] "Erika–86", it was instantly recognisable as an updated {{version of the}} previous model, with a smooth style nose and the [...] "straked" [...] rear lamp clusters smoothed over, internally the car had a revised dashboard and other smaller changes. Optional new features included a mechanical anti‐lock braking system (standard on RS Turbo models), a fuel computer on fuel-injected models, and a <b>heated</b> <b>windscreen.</b> However, the check-light system for low fuel, low oil, low coolant, low screenwash, and worn out brake pads was no longer fitted to any model. Air conditioning was not available on cars sold in Europe although it was an option on cars sold in Argentina and Brazil.|$|R
50|$|The Scammell Mechanical Horse, {{with its}} very 'square' wooden cab and steel chassis, {{remained}} largely unchanged {{until the late}} 1940s when the tractor section was redesigned, creating the Scammell Scarab, which featured the same successful automatic coupling from the original but now used the Scammell 2,090 cc side-valve engine in both the three- and six-ton versions. A diesel version was also introduced with a Perkins engine. The Scarab's cab was more rounded and made from steel including roof and <b>windscreen</b> <b>panels</b> pressed from steel tools obtained from Bedford {{that made up the}} roof of the 'O' type lorry. With the engine being mounted lower and more centrally than in the Mechanical Horse, the Scarab was much more stable. The railways for which this style of vehicle was originally designed continued to be a primary customer, although there were many other users, the manoeuvrability proving popular for companies operating in city environments.|$|R
50|$|The Zetec S Red was {{a limited}} (500 cars) edition {{based on the}} Zetec S and {{included}} a Colorado Red body, black-and-white chequered roof decal, dark privacy glass on the rear windows, panther black door mirrors, door handles, bodyside mouldings, roof spoiler and tailgate handle; Quickclear <b>heated</b> front <b>windscreen,</b> ebony leather seats, 16 in alloy wheels, air conditioning and heated electrically operated door mirrors.|$|R
5|$|The {{design of}} the He 111 A-L {{initially}} had a conventional stepped cockpit, {{with a pair of}} windscreen-like panels for the pilot and co-pilot. The He 111P and subsequent production variants were fitted with fully glazed cockpits and a laterally asymmetric nose, with the port side having the greater curvature for the pilot, offsetting the bombardier to starboard. The resulting stepless cockpit, which was a feature on a number of German bomber designs during the war years in varying shapes and formats, no longer had the separate <b>windscreen</b> <b>panels</b> for the pilot. Pilots had to look outside through the same bullet-like glazing that was used by the bombardier and navigator. The pilot was seated on the left and the navigator/bomb aimer on the right. The navigator went forward to the prone bomb-aiming position or could tilt his chair to one side, to move into the rear of the aircraft. There was no cockpit floor below the pilot's feet—the rudder pedals being on arms—giving very good visibility below. Sliding and removable panels were manufactured into the nose glazing to allow the pilot, navigator and or bomb aimer to exit the aircraft quickly, without a time-consuming retreat into the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The Ta 152 also {{featured}} the FuG 16ZY and FuG 25a radio equipment (some aircraft were issued with FuG 125 Hermine D/F for navigation and blind landing, LGW-Siemens K 23 autopilot, and a <b>heated</b> armor glass <b>windscreen</b> for bad-weather operations).|$|R
50|$|Safety {{was a high}} {{priority}} in the Mondeo design with a driver's side airbag (it was the first ever car sold from the beginning with a driver's airbag {{in all of its}} versions, which helped it achieve the ECOTY title for 1994), side-impact bars, seat belt pre-tensioners, and ABS (higher models) as standard features. Other features for its year included adaptive damping, self-leveling suspension (top estate models), traction control (V6 and 4WD versions), and <b>heated</b> front <b>windscreen,</b> branded Quickclear.|$|R
5000|$|Based on the XR2i, {{introduced}} a year earlier, it was visually similar. The main differences were 14" [...] alloy wheels (an inch larger {{and of a}} different design than those fitted to the XR2i) with 185/55 VR14 Pirelli P600 tyres, green rather than blue stripe mouldings, colour-coded rear spoiler and door pillars, opening rear quarter windows, green tinted glass and RS bonnet louvres. Anti-lock brakes and a [...] "Quickclear" [...] <b>heated</b> front <b>windscreen</b> were options at extra cost.|$|R
2500|$|In 1937, the German Ministry of Aviation {{issued a}} {{specification}} for a short-range, three-seat reconnaissance aircraft {{with a good}} allround view to support the German army in the field, replacing the Henschel Hs 126, which had just entered service. [...] A power of about 850–900hp (630–670kW) was specified. The specification was issued to Arado and Focke-Wulf. [...] Arado's design, the Ar 198, which was initially the preferred option, was a relatively conventional single-engined high-wing monoplane with a glazed gondola under the fuselage. [...] Focke-Wulf's chief designer Kurt Tank's design, the Fw 189, was a twin-boom design, powered by two Argus As 410 engines instead of with an expected single engine. As a [...] "twin-boom" [...] design like the earlier Dutch Fokker G.I from 1938, the Fw 189 used a central crew gondola for its crew accommodation, which for the Fw 189 would be designed with a heavily glazed and framed [...] "stepless" [...] cockpit forward section, which used no separate <b>windscreen</b> <b>panels</b> for the pilot (as with many German medium bombers from 1938 onwards). Blohm & Voss, however, proposed as a private venture something even more radical: chief designer Dr. Richard Vogt's unique asymmetric BV 141. Orders were placed for three prototypes, each of the Arado and Focke-Wulf designs, in April 1937.|$|R
25|$|The SD70ACe/LCi {{is a low}} clearance, export {{version of}} the SD70ACe. The LCi in the model {{designation}} stands for Low Clearance international as these locomotives are designed to negotiate the tight clearances under the mine equipment. External differences between the SD70ACe and SD70ACe/LCi models include the addition of marker lights, number boxes lower in the body rather than {{on top of the}} cab, <b>windscreen</b> protector <b>panels</b> (to deflect abrasive iron ore when in mid train position), fire suppression canisters, louvre style vents, different horn and subtle differences with handrails.|$|R
5000|$|The He 111P {{incorporated}} the updated Daimler-Benz DB 601A-1 liquid-cooled engine and featured a newly designed nose section, including an asymmetric mounting for an MG 15 machine gun that replaced the 'stepped' cockpit with a roomier and more aerodynamic glazed stepless cockpit {{over the entire}} front of the aircraft. This smooth glazed nose was first tested on the He 111 V8 in January 1938. These improvements allowed the aircraft to reach 475 km/h (295 mph) at 5,000 m (16,400 ft) and a cruise speed of 370 km/h (230 mph), although a full bomb load reduced this figure to 300 km/h (190 mph). The design was implemented in 1937 because pilot reports indicated problems with visibility.The pilot's seat could actually be elevated, with the pilot's eyes above {{the level of the}} upper glazing, complete with a small pivoted <b>windscreen</b> <b>panel,</b> to get the pilot's head above the level of the top of the [...] "glass tunnel" [...] for a better forward view for takeoffs and landings. The rear-facing dorsal gun position, enclosed with a sliding, near-clear view canopy, and for the first time, the ventral Bodenlafette rear-facing gun position, immediately aft of the bomb bay, that replaced the draggy [...] "dustbin" [...] retractable emplacement became standard, having been first flown on the He 111 V23, bearing civil registration D-ACBH.|$|R
5000|$|The EF 074 entry was {{essentially}} a scaled-up Ju 88, sharing its general layout {{and most of its}} fuselage and wings with extensions in various places. The nose was redesigned (as with the He 111P and -H's revised cockpits) with a more streamlined [...] "stepless cockpit", having no separate <b>windscreen</b> <b>panels</b> for the pilot and co-pilot. This layout allowed cabin pressurization to be more easily implemented. This design approach had been growing in favour, subsequently appearing in various German types. All of the defensive armament was meant to be remotely controlled — in one proposal, comprising a remotely operated rear-facing dorsal turret at the rearmost end of the cockpit glazing, and two remotely operated [...] "flank" [...] turrets on the rearwards sides of the fuselage just forward of the empennage, otherwise each resembling the FDSL 131 units of the Me 210 - the exclusive use of remotely operated turrets for the Ju 288's defensive firepower allowed them to be positioned more efficiently, as well as eliminating [...] "breaks" [...] in the fuselage pressurization. The fuselage was expanded along its length to allow for a much longer bomb bay — somewhat as had been done with the Dornier Do 217 then in development itself — that would allow for an 3,630 kg (8,000 lb) payload to be carried internally, eliminating the need to carry ordnance on outside hardpoints.|$|R
50|$|Both {{platforms}} have beige windscreens {{and brown}} canopies with red support frames and columns {{in the center}} and beige, waist-high, steel fences with lampposts at regular intervals at either ends. The <b>windscreens</b> have translucent <b>panels</b> by the exit staircases and the station signs are in the standard black name plates in white lettering.|$|R
5000|$|The Port Arthur was {{the first}} Chinese {{restaurant}} in New York City's Chinatown to obtain a liquor license. The restaurant was known for its delicious Chinese style dishes and delicacies {{as well as for}} its authentic Chinese style wall decor, inlaid pearl mahogany tables, teakwood chairs, ornate carved wooden <b>panels,</b> <b>windscreens,</b> lanterns, and chandeliers.|$|R
5000|$|As {{in every}} Bristol saloon since the 404, a {{compartment}} accessed via a hinged panel between {{the front of}} the driver's door and the rear of the front wheel arch housed the battery, fuse <b>panel,</b> <b>windscreen</b> wiper motor and brake servos. [...] A similar panel {{on the other side of}} the car housed the spare wheel and jack.|$|R
50|$|The Clubman {{comes in}} three {{specifications}} : Sportster, Roadster and Racer. All are open wheeled configuration. The Sportster is a road registered entry level model with small aeroscreen. The Roadster {{adds to the}} Sportster model a full <b>windscreen,</b> removable door <b>panels</b> and two-piece tonneau and the Racer model is a single seat racer for track only.|$|R
40|$|During {{the course}} of the Alliance Icing Research Study (AIRS) II {{inflight}} icing research flight programme, a freezing drizzle (FZL) icing accretion encounter occurred whilst on the base and final approach track legs in the radar-vectored Instrument Landing System (ILS) pattern, and configuring progressively into the landing configuration. Aerodynamic performance data has been derived from recorded inertial and air data, sliced into time intervals of varying length from 4 to 20 second duration. In particular, the changes in profile and induced drag coefficients ∆CDo and ∆k, respectively, and in lift-curve slope, ∆a, have been derived for each time slice, and examined in the time-domain. Useful drag component data has been extracted from the time-slices, indicating that non-substantial changes to ∂CD/∂CL 2 occurred, but approximately 380 % rise in CDo occurred. The CDo rise correlated reasonably with 80 VD, but not with the MVD, when the droplet size parameters were derived for the combined small (FSSP probes) and large droplet (2 DC probe) spectra. The drag rise was much larger than that measured in FZL, with wing flaps UP. It would equate to an approximate loss of climb gradient of 8. 7 %, very substantial when compared with landing-climb gradient and go-around obstacle-clearance climb-out path airworthiness and operational requirements, respectively. Icing accretion completely obscured the front <b>windscreen</b> <b>panels.</b> Post-flight, a runback icing accretion band was observed well aft of the heated leading edge sections, on the left wing upper surface...|$|R
5000|$|In early 1942, {{tests on}} a new and improved, {{completely}} glazed cockpit for the Do 217 series had been underway at the Hamburger Schiffbauanstalt (Hamburg Shipbuilding Institute). E-2s were fitted with a new streamlined [...] "stepless cockpit" [...] following its conceptual debut in January 1938 for the He 111P, as this design philosophy became the standard for almost all German bombers later in World War II, which eliminated the separate <b>windscreen</b> <b>panels</b> for the pilot of earlier versions of the Do 217. The lower nose of the K-version also retained the Bola inverted-casemate gondola for a rearwards-aimed ventral defensive armament emplacement, with its forward end fully incorporated with the new nose glazing design. The testing for this new well-framed cockpit glazing format for the later models of the Do 217, was carried out at the Shipbuilding Institute in Hamburg. The design of the cockpit was {{put to the test}} using water pressure to simulate a speed of 700 km/h. Only a few of the glass panels failed, caused by inadequate mounting. The cabin design passed the tests easily. Initial flights took place on 31 March 1942 after teething problems had been resolved. The Do 217 K V1 flew with BMW 801A-1s from Löwenthal and Erprobungsstelle Rechlin. This was followed by the ten-airframe pre-production batch, Do 217 K-01 to K-010. Mass production of the Do 217 K-1 began at the Dornier factory at Wismar.|$|R
50|$|The KLR {{is widely}} used as an {{inexpensive}} adventure/touring bike. The addition of luggage and personalized modifications (GPS, <b>heated</b> handgrips, larger <b>windscreens)</b> make it more functional on long trips. Bikes {{have been used for}} long distance and intercontinental trips, as well as full global circumnavigation rides e.g., by Dr. Gregory Frazier in 2001 and 2002.|$|R
