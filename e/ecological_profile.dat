40|$|Nature {{conservation}} is increasingly {{based on a}} landscape approach rather than a species approach. Landscape planning that includes nature conservation goals requires integrated ecological tools. However, species differ widely in their response to landscape change. We propose a framework of ecologically scaled landscape indices {{that takes into account}} this variation. Our approach is based on a combination of field studies of spatially structured populations (metapopulations) and model simulations in artificial landscapes. From these, we seek generalities in the relationship among species features, landscape indices, and metapopulation viability. The concept of <b>ecological</b> species <b>profiles</b> is used to group species according to characteristics that are important in metapopulations' response to landscape change: individual area requirements as the dominant characteristic of extinction risk in landscape patches and dispersal distance as the main determinant of the ability to colonize patches. The <b>ecological</b> <b>profiles</b> and landscape indices are then integrated into two ecologically scaled landscape indices (ESLI) : average patch carrying capacity and average patch connectivity. The field data show that the fraction of occupied habitat patches is correlated with the two ESLI. To put the ESLI into a perspective of metapopulation persistence, we determine the viability for six <b>ecological</b> <b>profiles</b> at different degrees of habitat fragmentation using a metapopulation model and computer-generated landscapes. The model results show that the fraction of occupied patches is a good indicator for metapopulation viability. We discuss how <b>ecological</b> <b>profiles,</b> ESLI, and the viability threshold can be applied for landscape planning and design in nature conservation...|$|R

40|$|Ekki or L. alata is a {{commercial}} timber species in Guinea-Congolian region considered vulnerable (IUCN, 2011).

Consequently, original research, to improve its ecological characterization to ensure its sustainable management is conducted in moist evergreen forest in southern Cameroon. First results on population dynamics of this species show, in plots study of recruitment, a population without major deficit regeneration. On its silvicultural ability, although that estimated on plantations on parks under 2 years old, the trends of growth (ca 30 and 0. 5 cm / year respectively in height and diameter) and mortality (3, 3 % / year) suggest a positive perspective.

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented {{of the ecological}} characteristics of ancient forest plant species in deciduous forests of Europe. Twenty-two literature sources were used to generate a list of 132 ancient forest plant species, described from at least eight countries in Europe. The affinity for ancient forests of these species differs considerably from country to country, {{but they have a}} definite <b>ecological</b> <b>profile.</b> There is {{a significant difference in the}} response of the ancient forest plant species compared with other forest plant species for a variety of ecological characteristics, based on Ellenberg indicators, plant strategies and phytosociological associations. Ancient forest plant species tend to be more shade-tolerant than the other forest plant species; dry and wet sites are avoided. They are typical of forest sites with an intermediate pH and nitrogen availability. Geophytes and hemicryptophytes are more frequent amongst ancient forest plant species. The stress-tolerant plant strategy type is significantly more abundant under the ancient forest species than expected when compared with other forest plant species and vice versa for the competitive plant strategy. This distinct <b>ecological</b> <b>profile</b> suggests that ancient forest plant species may be considered as a guild. The poor ability of these species to colonize new forest sites may be attributed to a complex of interacting variables: limited dispersal abilities (many have a short-distance dispersal strategy), low diaspore production and recruitment problems (e. g. low competitive ability). The regional variation in ancient forest plant species suggests that regional lists are more appropriate for assessing the nature conservation value of forests than one global European list. Due to their distinct <b>ecological</b> <b>profile</b> and low colonizing abilities, ancient forest plant species may be considered as important biodiversity indicators for forests.

40|$|International audienceFreshwater {{reclaimed}} marshes {{along the}} European Atlantic coast are highly suitable for European eels (Anguilla anguilla). However, European eel stocks have declined, and the coastal marshes {{have been subjected}} to major disturbances. The objective of our study was to analyze the processes governing patterns of European eel microhabitat distribution of four eel size classes (from, 160 mm to. 360 mm) in a reclaimed marsh (France). Analyses were conducted using artificial neural network (ANN) techniques and <b>ecological</b> <b>profiles.</b> Our ANN results showed that eel densities were significantly related to three major influencing variables: the width of ditch section, the silt depth, and the density of emergent plants. Such <b>ecological</b> <b>profiles</b> were significantly different between small (, 240 mm) and large eels (. 360 mm) : small eels were more widespread than large eels. Large eels were absent or at low densities in shallow ditches with a high aquatic plant cover obstructing the water column and a large quantity of silt. These characteristics seem to define the ditches not directly connected with the main river where dredging operations were rare. Management of regular dredging operations in the channels by maintaining a mosaic of permanent aquatic habitats and avoiding the heavy silt loads in most ditches should be promoted. This dredging operation {{was probably one of the}} most promising ways for restoring inland eel stocks...|$|R

Millions of tons of SCM, especially in Greece, are dumped due to overproduction or non-conformity with the existing standards. In this work, various types of SCM produced in Greece are investigated for a potential use in concrete. Their behavior as regards strength and durability is approached by a practical efficiency factor (A-value). The work is further focused on fly ashes. as they constitute the vast and more active majority of Greek SCM. The effectiveness of the Greek fly ashes in concrete improvement is widely proved through strength and durability measurements at laboratory and pilot-plant scale. However. they contain high amounts of free lime and sulphates, which may cause durability problems. In addition, they exhibit inadequate fineness and composition variations.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Namibia is {{well known}} for its unique climate and <b>ecological</b> <b>profile</b> hence its biodiversity, which {{comprises}} wild and cultivated species and varieties. The country’s relative isolation has contributed to the maintenance of a unique genetic resource base. There are many naturally occurring plants and animals that have been used since time immemorial by local people as a source of food security, primary health and for their general livelihood, which could be exploited for commercial purposes. There is a growing international interest in bio trade with, and bio prospecting in, Namibia. This paper examines Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR’s) 6 within the Namibian context. It further examines whether the protection under the current Namibian intellectual property (IP) framework sufficiently protects all types of indigenous TK against exploitation. The rationale for the examination stems from a draft policy on ‘Access to Genetic Resources and the Protection of Associated Traditional Knowledge’. There is little knowledge about the genetic resources that have left Namibia, those that are still here, and their biological and conservation status. The associated problems, concerns and threats underscore the need for policies and legislation to regulate access to genetic resources, to protect TK and practices, and to facilitate the equitable sharing of benefits from the use of genetic resources...|$|E

The methodology was developed throughout the collaboration with manufacturers of different types of products. Results obtained showed that the LCCE methodology resulted in being an easy-to-use ecodesign tool, able not only to manage the conformity of products but also to define the limit of environmental improvements which can be foreseen for the product (i. e. the value over which it is more convenient to re-think the product and its life cycle, rather than upgrading it). © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|E
40|$|The author {{proposes a}} {{framework}} to position ecopreneurship {{in relation to}} other forms of environmental management. The framework provides a reference for man-agers to introduce ecopreneurship. Five basic positions are distinguished according to the degree of environmental orientation of a company’s core business and the market impact of the company: environmental administrators, environmental man-agers, alternative activists, bioneers and ecopreneurs. The author suggests an approach to the qualitative operationalisation of ecopreneurship and to how to assess the position of a company in a classification matrix. The degree of environ-mental orientation in the company is assessed on the basis of environmental goals and policies, the <b>ecological</b> <b>profile</b> of the range of products and services, the organ-isation of environmental management in the company and the communication of environmental issues. The other dimension of ecopreneurship examined, the market impact of the company, is measured on the basis of market share, sales growth and the reactions of competitors. The approach is then applied to seven case studies of companies. The case studies show that the basic concept of ecopreneurship is applicable. The company representatives saw the approach as helpful in clarifying their position in ecopreneurial terms. The main benefit of the approach is that it provides a framework for self-assessment and indications for improvement...|$|E

Tourism and immigration may constitute an interface for mixing different genetic and <b>ecological</b> <b>profiles,</b> as well as cultural and social aspects, which is of particular interest in regard to zoonoses. Primary prevention, epidemiological surveillance and health education in the framework of intersectoral and international collaboration remain the cornerstone for response to and control of zoonoses in the context of tourism and immigration...|$|R
40|$|Aconitum in Europe is {{represented}} by ca. 10 % {{of the total number}} of species and the Carpathian Mts. are the center of the genus variability in the subcontinent. We studied the chloroplast DNA intergenic spacer trnL(UAG) -rpl 32 - ndhF (cpDNA) variability of the Aconitum subgen. Aconitum in the Carpathians: diploids (2 n= 16, sect. Cammarum), tetraploids (2 n= 32, sect. Aconitum) and triploids (2 n= 24, nothosect. Acomarum). Altogether 25 Aconitum accessions representing the whole taxonomic variability of the subgenus were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. Both parsimony, Bayesian and character network analyses showed the two distinct types of the cpDNA chloroplast, one typical of the diploid and the second of the tetraploid groups. Some specimens had identical cpDNA sequences (haplotypes) and scattered across the whole mountain arch. In the sect. Aconitum 9 specimens shared one haplotype, while in the sect. Camarum one haplotype represents 4 accessions and the second – 5 accessions. The diploids and tetraploids were diverged by 6 mutations, while the intrasectional variability amounted maximally to 3 polymorphisms. Taking into consideration different types of cpDNA haplotypes and <b>ecological</b> <b>profiles</b> of the sections (tetraploids – high‑mountain species, diploids – species from forest montane belt) we speculate on the different and independent history of the sections in the Carpathians...|$|R
