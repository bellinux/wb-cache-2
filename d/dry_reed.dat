40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 28 - 30, 1976 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThe {{primary role}} of the Space and Missile Test Center (SAMTEC) is to provide support for the {{relatively}} large number of various types of missiles launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB). Associated with this function is the requirement to provide telemetry decommutation/data processing systems capable of processing the telemetry transmitted by the missiles. At present, the telemetry data is routed {{to and from the}} analog tape recorders and bit synchronizers through patch boards, which totals over 200 inputs. This represents a myriad of patching combinations when considering the number of different missile formats and outputs that have to be manually patched and unpatched. SAMTEC contracted with Electrospace Systems, Inc., (ESI) for a <b>dry</b> <b>reed</b> relay switching system. The switching system, Analog Data Equipment Switching System (ADESS), consists of seven matrices under the control of a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Model PDP- 11 / 05 minicomputer. The ADESS matrices 1 and 2 are three stage switching systems with the respective input/output - 100 x 90 and 60 x 70. Matrices 3 through 7 range from a 40 x 40 down to a 10 x 20 rectangular matrix configuration. Matrix 1 has a frequency response range of DC- 12 MHz, matrices 2 through 6 have a range from DC- 3 MHz, and matrix 7 ranges from DC- 15 MHz. The PDP- 11 / 05 peripherals include a CRT/Keyboard and dual floppy disk which controls the latching and status of the matrix switches and stores the mission set up files which can be rapidly called up by the operator. The ADESS will decrease turn around by up to ten times as compared to present operations...|$|E
