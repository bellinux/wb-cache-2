Consequently, it became {{progressively}} more difficult for employees who handsorted mail to memorize and <b>keep</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> all the individual letter-carrier routes within each city. New technology that allowed mail to be delivered faster also contributed to the pressure for these employees to properly sort the mail.|$|E

5|$|Every {{driver of}} a CMV is {{required}} to <b>keep</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> his/her time with a log book or an ELD. A log book is simply a notebook with a grid pattern on every page, dividing the 24-hour day into 15-minute (1/4-hour) segments.

5|$|DST's clock shifts {{have the}} obvious {{disadvantage}} of complexity.

People who work across time zone boundaries need to <b>keep</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> multiple DST rules, as not all locations observe DST or observe it the same way. The length of the calendar day becomes variable; {{it is no longer}} always 24 hours. Disruption to meetings, travel, broadcasts, billing systems, and records management is common, and can be expensive. During an autumn transition from 02:00 to 01:00, a clock reads times from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 twice, possibly leading to confusion.|$|E
