5|$|Before I {{had become}} {{familiar}} with my surroundings the President sent for me. In the interview that followed he told me what he wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon {{in the way of}} the new coinage. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Negroponte {{spoke at}} the World Economic Forum, in Davos. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> he urged {{industry}} to solve the problem, to enable a $100 laptop, which would enable constructionist learning, would revolutionize education, and would bring the world's knowledge to all children. He brought a mock-up and was described as prowling the halls and corridors of Davos to whip up support. Despite the reported skepticism of Bill Gates and others, Negroponte left Davos with committed interest from AMD, News Corp, and with strong indications of support from many other firms.|$|E

2500|$|In 1953, {{soon after}} his {{appointment}} as United Nations Secretary-General, Hammarskjöld was interviewed on radio by Edward R.

6000|$|Ferris went on, with a doubting look at her, for he {{had been}} shy of {{introducing}} Don Ippolito's name since the day on the Brenta, {{and he did not}} know what effect a recurrence to him <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> might have. [...] "I've often wondered if our own clerical friend were not a little shaky in his faith. I don't think nature meant him for a priest. He always strikes me as an extremely secular-minded person. I doubt if he's ever put the question whether he is what he professes to be, squarely to himself--he's such a mere dreamer." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was a good}} breeze that day, so {{the boat}} glided swiftly over the water. By and by {{they came to a}} smaller river that flowed from out a deep forest, and the Tin Woodman {{proposed}} they sail up this stream, as it would be cool and shady beneath the trees of the forest. So the Scarecrow, who was steering, turned the boat up the stream and the friends continued talking together of old times and the wonderful adventures they had met with while traveling with Dorothy, the little Kansas girl. They became so much interested <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> that they forgot to notice that the boat was now sailing through the forest, or that the stream was growing more narrow and crooked.|$|E
60|$|Of this heaven, as {{was said}} afore, we are possessed already, {{we are in}} it, we are set down in it, and partake already of the {{benefits}} thereof, but all by our head and undertaker; and 'tis fit that we should believe this, rejoice <b>in</b> <b>this,</b> <b>talk</b> of this, tell one another of this, {{and live in the}} expectation of our own personal enjoyment of it. And as we should do all this, so we should bless and praise the name of God who has put over this house, this kingdom, and inheritance into the hand of so faithful a friend. Yea, a brother, a Saviour and blessed undertaker for us. And lastly, since all these things already mentioned, are the fruit of the sufferings of our Jesus, and his sufferings the fruit of that love of his that passeth knowledge: how should we bow the knee before him, and call him tender Father; yea, how should we love and obey him, and devote ourselves unto his service, and be willing to be also sufferers for his sake, to whom be honour and glory for ever. And thus much of the love of Christ in general.|$|E
