50|$|At {{one time}} {{brushless}} DC electric motors used reed switches {{to sense the}} rotor's position relative to the field poles.

The motor design could also be 'inverted', placing permanent magnets onto the rotor and switching the field through the external, <b>fixed</b> <b>coils.</b> This avoided the need for any rubbing contact to provide power to the rotor. Such motors were used in low-power long-service-life items such as computer cooling fans and disk drives.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} of the wireless battery charging platform have prompted requirements to investigate the mutual inductance between a movable planar <b>coil</b> and the <b>fixed</b> planar <b>coil</b> on the charging platform. The wireless battery charging platform must allow the load to be placed anywhere on the charging surface. Therefore, the relative position between the movable energy-receiving coil and the energy-transmitting coils on the charging platform must be flexible. In this paper, an extended formula is proposed for the mutual inductance calculation for two coaxial or noncoaxial planar spiral windings sandwiched between two double-layer substrates. It can quickly determine the mutual coupling of two planar windings that can have different relative positions and distance between them. This new calculation method provides a new and useful tool for determining the mutual inductance of a movable planar <b>coil</b> and the <b>fixed</b> planar <b>coil</b> on the wireless battery charging platform. The theory has been favorably tested and compared with practical measurements and also with finite-element analysis. © 2009 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Transcranial {{magnetic}} stimulation {{has become}} an established tool in experimental cognitive neuroscience and has more recently been applied clinically. The current spatial extent of neural activation is several millimeters but with greater specificity, transcranial magnetic stimulation can potentially deliver real time feedback to reinforce or extinguish behavior by exciting or inhibiting localized neural circuits. The specificity of transcranial magnetic stimulation {{is a function of}} the stimulation coil geometry. In this paper, a practical multilayer framework for the design of miniaturized stimulation coils is presented. This framework is based on a magnet wire fabricated from 2500 braided ultrafine wires. Effects of coil bending angle on stimulation specificity are examined using realistic finite element method simulations. A novel stimulation coil with one degree of freedom is also proposed that shows improved specificity over the conventional <b>fixed</b> <b>coils.</b> This type of coil could be potentially used as a feedback system for a bidirectional brain machine interface.

50|$|Moving iron {{ammeters}} use a {{piece of}} iron which moves when acted upon by the electromagnetic force of a <b>fixed</b> <b>coil</b> of wire. The moving-iron meter was invented by Austrian engineer Friedrich Drexler in 1884. This type of meter responds to both direct and alternating currents (as opposed to the moving-coil ammeter, which works on direct current only). The iron element consists of a moving vane attached to a pointer, and a fixed vane, surrounded by a coil. As alternating or direct current flows through the coil and induces a magnetic field in both vanes, the vanes repel {{each other and the}} moving vane deflects against the restoring force provided by fine helical springs. The deflection of a moving iron meter is proportional to the square of the current. Consequently, such meters would normally have a non linear scale, but the iron parts are usually modified in shape to make the scale fairly linear over most of its range. Moving iron instruments indicate the RMS value of any AC waveform applied. Moving iron ammeters are commonly used to measure current in industrial frequency AC circuits.|$|E
5000|$|The VTM-4 system's {{electronic}} control unit (ECU) determines torque {{which is to be}} distributed to the rear wheels, then electric current is sent to the two electromagnetic coils. The resulting magnetic field moves a rotating steel plate toward each <b>fixed</b> <b>coil.</b> Friction between that steel plate and an adjoining cam plate causes the cam plate to begin turning. As it does, three balls per clutch roll up curved ramps, creating an axial thrust against a clutch-engagement plate. This thrust force compresses the wet clutch plates, thereby engaging drive to the corresponding rear wheel. [...] Unlike mechanically actuated four-wheel drive systems, the VTM-4 system is infinitely variable. The amount of torque provided to the rear wheels is directly proportional to the electric current sent from the ECU and can be adjusted from zero to a preset maximum. This current constantly changes to deliver the optimum rear torque calculated by the ECU. An internal gear pump circulates VTM-4 fluid to cool and lubricate the clutches, bearings, and gears within the rear drive unit. Use of high-strength, low-weight materials such as diecast aluminum for the housing minimizes the bulk and weight of this hardware, helping to keep the weight of the entire all-wheel-drive system to about 212-pounds.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} Finite Element (FEM) analysis of a Linear compressor of voice coil type (LCVCT). This kind of linear compressor {{will be used in}} a refrigerator equipment. It is well-known that the replacing of the rotating compressor from a classical refrigerator by a linear compressor leads to an efficiency improving wit about 5 % by avoiding the piston side friction, which is very important because of the huge number of refrigerators in operation world-wide. The linear compressor refrigerator is already commercially available in South Korea, equipped with an electromagnetic (<b>fix</b> <b>coil</b> and moving permanent magnet) linear compressor. This paper presents a new type of linear compressor - a voice-coil type (fixed permanent magnet and moving coil). The operation principle is the same as for electrodynamic vibrator or electro-dynamic loud-speaker. The designing with rare earth permanent magnet is not a simple problem, because of the nonlinear characteristic of rare earth magnets.

40|$|Objective: To {{introduce}} a new technique for co-registration of Magnetoencephalography (MEG) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We compare the accuracy of a new bite-bar with fixed fiducials to a previous technique whereby fiducial coils were attached proximal to landmarks on the skull. Methods: A bite-bar with <b>fixed</b> fiducial <b>coils</b> is {{used to determine the}} position of the head in the MEG co-ordinate system. Co-registration is performed by a surface-matching technique. The advantage of <b>fixing</b> the <b>coils</b> is that the co-ordinate system is not based upon arbitrary and operator dependent fiducial points that are attached to landmarks (e. g. nasion and the preauricular points), but rather on those that are permanently fixed in relation to the skull. Results: As a consequence of minimizing coil movement during digitization, errors in localization of the coils are significantly reduced, as shown by a randomization test. Displacement of the bite-bar caused by removal and repositioning between MEG recordings is minimal (∼ 0. 5 mm), and dipole localization accuracy of a somatosensory mapping paradigm shows a repeatability of ∼ 5 mm. The overall accuracy of the new procedure is greatly improved compared to the previous technique. Conclusions: The test-retest reliability and accuracy of target localization with the new design is superior to techniques that incorporate anatomical-based fiducial points or coils placed on the circumference of the head. © 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.
