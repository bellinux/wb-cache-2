5|$|Cancellor {{was found}} dead in his bedroom on the morning of 22 April. His body was covered, with long {{stockings}} over his legs and kidskin gloves on his hands. The only visible part of the body was <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>A</b> medical man of Hopley's acquaintance named Roberts pronounced that the boy had died of natural causes. When questioned, Hopley suggested that Cancellor died of heart disease and argued that he should be buried immediately. He wrote to the boy's father requesting the body's immediate removal and interment. After viewing his son's dressed body, Cancellor's father accepted Roberts' assertion for cause of death and agreed to the burial.|$|E
5|$|Dodd's tenure {{included}} Georgia Tech's {{withdrawal from}} the Southeastern Conference. The initial spark for Dodd's withdrawal was a historic feud with Alabama Crimson Tide Coach Bear Bryant. The feud began when Tech was visiting the Tide at Legion Field in Birmingham in 1961. After a Tech punt, Alabama fair-caught the ball. Chick Granning of Tech was playing coverage and relaxed after the signal for the fair catch. Darwin Holt of Alabama continued play and smashed his elbow into Granning's face causing severe fracturing in <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>a</b> broken nose, and blood-filled sinuses. Granning was knocked unconscious and suffered a severe concussion, the result of which left him unable to play football ever again. Dodd sent Bryant a letter asking Bryant to suspend Holt after game film indicated Holt had intentionally injured Granning. Bryant never suspended Holt. The lack of discipline infuriated Dodd and sparked Dodd's interest in withdrawing from the SEC.|$|E

25|$|Mickey's eyes, {{as drawn}} in Plane Crazy and The Gallopin' Gaucho, were large and white with black {{outlines}}. In Steamboat Willie, the bottom {{portion of the}} black outlines was removed, although the upper edges still contrasted with his head. Mickey's eyes were later re-imagined as only consisting of the small black dots which were originally his pupils, while what were the upper edges of his eyes became a hairline. This is evident only when Mickey blinks. Fred Moore later redesigned the eyes to be small white eyes with pupils and gave <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> Caucasian skin tone instead of plain white. This new Mickey first appeared in 1938 {{on the cover of}} a party program, and in animation the following year with the release of The Pointer. Mickey is sometimes given eyebrows as seen in The Simple Things (1953) and in the comic strip, although he does not have eyebrows in his most recent appearances.|$|E
25|$|His family {{stated that}} Tobares' enthusiasm for work went {{down a few}} months before he disappeared. He told his sister that he was scared, and one time he called her sobbing. In March 2013, he spoke to his sister and told her that he wanted to return to Argentina. They believe that Tobares was kidnapped because he might have seen {{something}} suspicious while on the job that his employers did not want him to see. Tobares worked at Hotelito Desconocido and Nudoki Sushi Bar, but he was also a hired chef for private parties; his family told investigators that Tobares was sometimes taken by the CJNG, Tobares' last employer, to their private islands in western Mexico to cook for their exclusive events. He was not allowed to leave for a few days and was prohibited from using his cellphone while he was there. His family believes that in one of those private parties, Tobares saw something suspicious and began asking third-parties to clarify what he saw. When the CJNG found out what he was doing, Gerardo reportedly threatened him and told him to ask those question to <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>A</b> week before his disappearance, Gerardo reportedly ordered Tobares to close down the Asian restaurant and fire all of the employees.|$|E

Liner notes, which included large-type excerpts of the album's lyrics on bright gradients, were {{designed by}} Johnny Costello of Adult Art Club [...] "to echo high impact religious posters".

500|$|Felix Leiter, James Bond's CIA {{ally and}} friend, {{played a part}} in six of the Fleming novels; he is {{introduced}} in Casino Royale as being thin, tall, about thirty-five years old and a former U.S. Marine who was working with the Joint Intelligence Staff of NATO. Fleming named the character after two of his American friends: [...] "Felix" [...] was Ivar Bryce's middle name, whilst Tommy Leiter was a mutual friend. Academic Kerstin Jütting describes Leiter as [...] "a cool and quiet no-nonsense character who knows 007's strengths and weaknesses well". Physically, Fleming describes Leiter in Casino Royale: [...] "a mop of straw-coloured hair lent <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> boyish look which closer examination contradicted".|$|E

500|$|Mucho Macho Man is a {{bay horse}} with white {{markings}} {{that include a}} star and stripe on <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>a</b> sock on his left hind leg, and a coronet on his front right leg. He stands over [...] high. [...] He was sired by Macho Uno, who won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and was named American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt in 2000. Macho Uno was a son of Hall of Fame champion Holy Bull. [...] Mucho Macho Man's dam is the 2001 Anoakia Stakes winner Ponche de Leona. Both sire and dam were owned by Frank Stronach's Adena Springs Farms {{at the time of}} mating; the pregnant mare was subsequently purchased by John and Carole Rio of Florida, where Mucho Macho Man was foaled, and thus the Rios are officially listed as his breeders. Mucho Macho Man was Ponche de Leona's second foal and was born extremely late in the foaling season on June 15, 2008; this meant that as a two- and three-year-old, not yet fully grown, he had to compete on equal terms with horses who were as much as five months older than he.|$|E

Hitchens was strapped to the board at the chest and feet, face up, and unable to move. Metal objects were placed {{in each of his}} hands, which he could drop if feeling [...] "unbearable stress". The interrogator placed a towel over Hitchens' face, and poured water on it. After 16 seconds, Hitchens threw the metal objects to the floor and the torturers pulled the mask from his face, allowing him to breathe. In his article on the topic, he stated [...] "Well, then, if waterboarding does not constitute torture, then {{there is no such thing}} as torture." ...|$|E

2500|$|From Khartoum, he {{proceeded}} up the White Nile to Gondokoro. During {{his time in}} Sudan, Gordon was much involved in attempting to suppress the slave trade while struggling against a corrupt and inefficient Egyptian bureaucracy that {{had no interest in}} suppressing the slave trade. Gordon soon learned that his superior, the Governor-General of the Sudan, Ismail Aiyub Pasha was deeply involved in the slave trade and doing everything within his power to sabotage Gordon's anti-slavery work by denying him supplies and leaking information to the slavers. Gordon also clashed with Chaillé-Long, whom he accused of working as an informant for Aiyub Pasha and called him to <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> [...] "regular failure". Chaillé-Long in return painted a very unflattering picture of Gordon in his 1884 book The Three Prophets, whom he portrayed as a bully, a raging alcoholic, an incompetent leader and a rank coward. Faught argued that since no one else who knew Gordon in Equatoria described him in these terms and given that Gordon's accusation that Chaillé-Long was a spy for Aiyub Pasha seems to be justified, that Chaillé-Long was engaging in character assassination as an act of revenge.|$|E
2500|$|At {{nine years}} old Erik's mother begins {{to respond to the}} attentions of the handsome, new town physician, which upsets Erik. He uses his new-found {{abilities}} to hypnotize her into rejecting the physicians advances and keep her trapped in their home under his care, but his relationship with the villagers comes to a boiling point when they kill his beloved dog. Erik runs away from home believing this will make his mother's life easier. [...] After a week or so without food, he stumbles upon a Gypsy camp in the woods. He is discovered as a thief and is unmasked. [...] Upon seeing <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>a</b> freak show showman named Javert decides to exhibit him as the [...] "Living Corpse" [...] and Erik is locked in a cage. The act involves a great deal of abuse including keeping his arms and legs tied down so that attendees can look at him, and the showman regularly beats him. Eventually, he gains some personal freedoms as he develops his show to include the illusions that he had begun to master as a child in Boscherville. [...] He travels around Europe with the Gypsies and masters their languages as well as their herbal remedies, remaining with the tribe until he is about 12 years old when the showman drunkenly attempts to force himself on him, at which point Erik kills him and is forced to once again flee.|$|E
2500|$|However, Vertov's two credos, {{often used}} interchangeably, {{are in fact}} distinct, as Yuri Tsivian points out in the {{commentary}} track on the DVD for Man with the Movie Camera: for Vertov, [...] "life as it is" [...] means to record life {{as it would be}} without the camera present. [...] "Life caught unawares" [...] means to record life when surprised, and perhaps provoked, by the presence of a camera. This explanation contradicts the common assumption that for Vertov [...] "life caught unawares" [...] meant [...] "life caught unaware of the camera." [...] All of these shots might conform to Vertov's credo [...] "caught unawares." [...] His slow motion, fast motion, and other camera techniques were a way to dissect the image, Mikhail Kaufman stated in an interview. It was to be the honest truth of perception. For example, in Man with a Movie Camera, two trains are shown almost melting into each other, although we are taught to see trains as not riding that close, Vertov tried to portray the actual sight of two passing trains. Mikhail spoke about Eisenstein's films as being different from his and his brother's in that Eisenstein, [...] "came from the theatre, in the theatre one directs dramas, one strings beads." [...] "We all felt...that through documentary film we could develop a new kind of art. Not only documentary art, or the art of chronicle, but rather an art based on images, the creation of an image-oriented journalism" [...] Mikhail explained. More than even film truth, Man with a Movie Camera, {{was supposed to be a}} way to make those in the Soviet Union more efficient in their actions. He slowed down his actions, such as the decision whether to jump or not, you can see the decision in <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>a</b> psychological dissection for the audience. He wanted a peace between the actions of man and the actions of a machine, for them to be, in a sense, one.|$|E
