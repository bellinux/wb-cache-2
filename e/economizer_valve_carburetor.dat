5000|$|The only {{petrol engine}} {{available}} was the 2.2 L 8 <b>valve</b> (<b>carburetor</b> {{for the early}} production, fuel injection for the later models), and the only diesel engine available was the 2.1 L. Both engines were available for the three body versions. The liftback was imported from France and called by the trim [...] "Alizé". Was replaced for the Laguna.|$|R
50|$|The {{carburetor}} typically {{contains a}} float bowl {{into which the}} expelled fuel is pumped. When the fuel level in the float bowl exceeds a certain level, the inlet <b>valve</b> to the <b>carburetor</b> will close, preventing the fuel pump from pumping more fuel into the carburetor. At this point, any remaining fuel inside the pump chamber is trapped, unable to exit through the inlet port or outlet port. The diaphragm will continue to allow pressure to the diaphragm, and during the subsequent rotation, the eccentric will pull the diaphragm back to bottom dead center, where it will remain until the inlet <b>valve</b> to the <b>carburetor</b> reopens.|$|R
5000|$|In Japan, the Z {{was still}} {{known as the}} Fairlady to keep the car {{in line with the}} {{previous}} generation Datsun Sports roadster. JDM versions had the Fairlady Z badge on the lower fenders with the 432 badge above (the 432 designation was 4 <b>valves,</b> 3 <b>carburetors,</b> and 2 camshafts). However, Yutaka Katayama ensured the American version had all Nissan, Fairlady Z, and 432 badging replaced with [...] "Datsun" [...] and prevented all dealer shipments until they were replaced.|$|R
5000|$|From 1950 he {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} {{the research and development}} of his most important invention, a rotating motor or reaction turbine which he named the [...] "Turbozám", also known as a [...] "criole motor". While a conventional motor is constructed from thousands of parts, the Turbozám only has around 20. It uses a single sparkplug and a single four-cycle chamber, and has no connecting rods, pistons, camshafts, <b>valves,</b> <b>carburetor</b> or crankshaft. It consists of rotating parts on a drive shaft that, on rotating, produces compression and expansion aided by the inertia of a flywheel, based on a pair of blades or [...] "bailadores" [...] that act as pistons, named in honor of his village. These blades replace the rotating cam of conventional motors and are driven by a planetary gear system which forms a combustion chamber between the two blades. The feasibility of this engine has been proven by engineers at the University of Los Andes interested in the subject, but has not been implemented, due to lack of support for blade construction. It could rotate at 5000 rpm. He could not finish developing it for lack of support for the construction of the blades.|$|R
50|$|The little Silver Diamonds (220 and 240 cid) engines {{featured}} rotating <b>valves</b> {{and improved}} <b>carburetor,</b> plus a ceramic fuel filter and hotter spark plugs. LPG engines, which {{had previously been}} offered only in L-185 and larger models, were available in trucks as light as the R-150 in the new line.|$|R
60|$|She stopped two motorists. The {{first was}} sure that there was dirt {{on the point of}} the needle <b>valve,</b> in the <b>carburetor.</b> While Claire shuddered lest he never get it back, he took out the needle valve, wiped it, put it back--and the engine was again started, and again, with great promptness, it stopped.|$|R
50|$|A limited edition, the XP 800, {{was offered}} in 1995 as well. The 800 model {{featured}} a 110HP engine based on BRP's snowmobile motors. The new engine was 782cc and {{was equipped with}} pressure operated variable exhaust port timing valves, or (Rotax Automatic Variable Exhaust)R.A.V.E. <b>valves,</b> dual <b>carburetors,</b> and a tuned, variable water injected expansion chamber, which helped the XP 800 reach speeds of 59 mph. The 800 was also differentiated by a yellow hull, top deck, seat, cowling and handle pole cover. The cowling had a single gauge and no mirrors. The rear of the hull was pink, and the graphic accents were pink.|$|R
50|$|Even {{the engines}} used {{were the same}} of the 1300/1500 models, {{although}} in part had been revised in some parts. The 1301 was equipped with a 4-cylinder Rush 1290 cc with overhead <b>valve,</b> powered <b>carburetor</b> single body capable of delivering 54 hp DIN (equivalent to 62 hp SAE declared in 1300) and launching the car to a 135 km/h top speed Max. Similarly, the Simca 1501 was equipped by the same engine 2N2 of the previous Simca 1500, a 4-cylinder 1475 cc carburetor feuled double body and capable of delivering 81 hp DIN of power maximum. The maximum speed was improved slightly, reaching 160 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Device {{controls}} the ignition, fuel injection {{and various other}} actuators of {{the internal combustion engine}} (ICE) and vehicle. In particular, it is capable of controlling the carburetor's choke using a stepper motor (auto choke), thus controlling RPM when engine is warming up. Manages AFR on the carburetor (like AXTEC AFR systems), idle cut off and power <b>valve</b> on <b>carburetor,</b> electric fuel pump, stepper gas valve with oxygen sensor loopback etc. Unique opportunities for reassigning the I/O functions. Smooth speed control of the cooling fan motor. The ability to edit the main settings and maps in real time (when engine is running) and switching between 2 or 4 sets of maps.

5000|$|Soon {{after the}} new company was formed in 1898, the firm moved its {{manufacturing}} from Tours to Paris, into its new factory (a former hydraulic machinery plant that Morane and his brother-in-law Leon Desmarais had inherited from Morane's father). Charles Weiffenbach was named Operations Manager. Delahaye would produce three models there, until {{the close of the}} 19th century: two twins, the 2.2-litre [...] Type 1 and [...] Type 2, and the lighter Type 0 (which proved capable of up to 22 mph), with a 1.4-liter single rated between [...] All three had bicycle-style steering, water-cooled engines mounted in the rear, automatic <b>valves,</b> surface <b>carburetors,</b> and trembler coil ignition; drive was a combination of belt and chain, with three forward speeds and one reverse.|$|R
50|$|Choke valves are {{important}} for naturally-aspirated gasoline engines because small droplets of gasoline do not evaporate well within a cold engine. By restricting the flow of air into the throat of the <b>carburetor,</b> the choke <b>valve</b> reduces the pressure inside the throat, which causes a proportionally-greater amount of fuel to be pushed from the main jet into the combustion chamber during cold-running operation. Once the engine is warm (from combustion), opening the choke <b>valve</b> restores the <b>carburetor</b> to normal operation, supplying fuel and air in the correct stoichiometric ratio for clean, efficient combustion.|$|R
5000|$|Named {{to evoke}} {{memories}} of the Sunbeam Tiger, the Avenger Tiger concept began as a publicity exercise. Avenger Super (four-door) cars were modified by the Chrysler Competitions Centre under Des O' Dell and the Tiger model was launched in March 1972. Modifications included the 1500 GT engine with an improved cylinder head with enlarged <b>valves,</b> twin Weber <b>carburetors</b> and a compression ratio of 9.4:1. The engine now developed [...] at 6,100 rpm. The suspension was also uprated, whilst brakes, rear axle, and gearbox are directly from the GT.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the mid-1970s}} in the North American market, {{emission}} control regulations were reducing engine {{performance at the}} same time as safety regulations were making cars heavier. An increase in performance was required for the G-engine, so a 2-barrel setup was released for the 1976 model year. This was not the same as the export 2-barrel package; the intake manifold used a throttle-bored plenum rather than an open one, and had provisions for an EGR <b>valve.</b> The <b>carburetor,</b> a Carter BBD similar but not identical to the one used on Chrysler's 318 V8 engine, used a standard Chrysler-style remote automatic choke. A -inch exhaust headpipe was also provided, as well as 2-barrel-specific advance curves in the ignition distributor. This package, called [...] "Super Six" [...] by the marketing division, brought rated horsepower from [...] and torque from 170 to 180 lbft Nm, while improving throttle response and driveability thus maintaining compliance with emission laws.|$|R
50|$|First major revision. New chassis design, engine {{revisions}} {{and body}} work. Introduction {{of a new}} short-stroke version of the oil-cooled engine, now displacing 748 cc. Engine had 73 mm bore and 44.7 mm stoke and could achieve higher engine speeds (13,000 rpm redline indicated, but rev limiter engaged at 13,500 according to the Suzuki shop manual). Internal engine dimensions changed to accommodate the new bore and stroke. This engine used larger <b>valves</b> and <b>carburetors</b> than previous years. Mikuni model BST36SS 'Slingshot' carbs were 36 mm diameter and featured vacuum operated slides; the slide cross section resembled {{the shape of a}} slingshot. A four spring clutch was used on the short stroke motor. New styling, and twin black silencers. Wheels were now a 17 in diameter, three spoke design and used a 160/60VR17 in the rear and 120/70VR17 in the front. Slingshot graphic first appeared on the bodywork. Forks now used a cartridge design and were 43 mm in diameter. The second generation model was heavier than the first but had a stiffer frame and more power.|$|R
50|$|Alternative to {{employing}} a power <b>valve,</b> the <b>carburetor</b> may utilize a metering rod or step-up rod system {{to enrich the}} fuel mixture under high-demand conditions. Such systems were originated by Carter Carburetor in the 1950s for the primary two Venturis of their four barrel carburetors, and step-up rods were widely used on most 1-, 2-, and 4-barrel Carter carburetors {{through the end of}} production in the 1980s. The step-up rods are tapered at the bottom end, which extends into the main metering jets. The tops of the rods are connected to a vacuum piston or a mechanical linkage which lifts the rods out of the main jets when the throttle is opened (mechanical linkage) or when manifold vacuum drops (vacuum piston). When the step-up rod is lowered into the main jet, it restricts the fuel flow. When the step-up rod is raised out of the jet, more fuel can flow through it. In this manner, the amount of fuel delivered is tailored to the transient demands of the engine. Some 4-barrel carburetors use metering rods only on the primary two Venturis, but some use them on both primary and secondary circuits, as in the Rochester Quadrajet.|$|R
5000|$|New at Cadillac for 1967 was a {{redesigned}} {{side panel}} contour {{that created a}} longer look and more sculptured appearance. Technical improvements included a revised engine <b>valve</b> train, different <b>carburetor,</b> Mylar printed circuit instrument panel, re-tuned body mounts and a new engine fan with clutch for quieter operation. A squarer cornered radiator grille insert had a cross-hatch pattern that appeared both above the bumper and through a horizontal slot cut into it, with a V-shaped appearance exhibiting a modern approach last used in 1954-1956 models. Rear end styling revisions were highlighted by metal divided taillamps and a painted lower bumper section. The new grille had a forward angle and blades that seemed to emphasize its vertical members. Rectangular parking lamps were housed in the outer ends. This year's new styling was particularly beautifully rendered on the Series 75 which had extra-long rear fenders and an extended [...] "greenhouse" [...] with a formal high-headroom look. Fleetwood wreath and crest emblems decorated the hood and the trunk and there were Fleetwood block letters at {{the right side of}} the deck lid. A simple horizontal body rub molding, lengthened to fit the elongated sheet metal, trimmed the sides of these elegant machines. Standard equipment now included automatic level control; air conditioning; carpeted fold-down foot rests and 8.20 x 15 four ply 8PR blackwall tires.|$|R
50|$|Nitros engines {{typically}} use a carburetor to mix {{the fuel}} and air together, although for some applications where throttling is not required they have a simple venturi with a spraybar and needle <b>valve.</b> The <b>carburetor</b> can either be sliding or rotary. On a rotary carburetor, the slide is opened as the arm is turned by the servo. On a slide carburetor the slide is opened by sliding the arm out by the servo. Both are held open slightly by an idle screw which allows the engine to receive a very small amount of fuel to keep the engine running when the vehicle is at a stop. The carburetors usually feature 2 needles used to tune the mixture. A high speed needle tunes how much fuel is allowed into the carburetor at mid to high RPM, and a low speed needle determines how much fuel is allowed into the carburetor at low to mid range RPM. Turning either needle in a clockwise motion will thin the fuel mixture. Lean describes the amount of fuel in the fuel / air mixture. To a point this will make the engine run faster with better performance, but once too lean the engine will overheat, and wear out prematurely due to not receiving enough lubrication. Turning either needle counterclockwise will enrich the fuel mixture (unless the low speed needle is an air bleed {{in which case the}} opposite is true). Rich is the opposite of lean, it means more oil (fuel mixture) is entering the engine. If the engine is too rich, it will run poorly, and fuel that has not yet been burnt may start to spit out of the exhaust. The engine will run very slowly and seem to have no power and possibly cut out from being flooded with fuel. Although, being too rich is better than being too lean, because being too rich just means the engine is getting too much oil which is perfectly fine, although performance may not be as good as if the engine were lean. An excessively lean mixture can damage an engine in a short time, as it will run above its design temperature. A properly tuned engine will last a long time with good performance throughout its life.|$|R
5000|$|A {{carburetor}} is used {{to provide}} the air-fuel mixture. Carbureted engines are susceptible to carburetor icing, a condition most {{likely to occur in}} conditions of a low 11 °C (20 °F) difference between the outside air temperature and dew point (the [...] "dew point spread"), as well as visible signs of moisture in the atmosphere. Icing can lead to loss of engine power and, if not corrected, total shutdown of the engine. A carburetor heat control {{is used to}} supply heated air to the carburetor; this can prevent or cure icing, but also causes a reduction in engine power output because hot air is less dense, enriching the fuel-air mixture. The carburetor heat control is a simple plunger-type control mounted on the center console near the collective pitch control lever. Pulling the control up slides a gate <b>valve</b> near the <b>carburetor</b> that admits warm air from a scoop on the exhaust system. The R22 employs a carburetor air temperature gauge, marked to indicate temperatures conducive to icing. The Beta II version of the R22 also includes a [...] "carburetor heat assist" [...] which automatically applies carburetor heat when the collective is lowered below a certain point. When icing conditions are present, carburetor heat is required to prevent icing around the butterfly valve from the pressure drop at that point. As the carburetor air temperature (CAT) indicator does not read correctly below 18 in of intake manifold air pressure, icing conditions require applying full carburetor heat below 18 in of manifold pressure. A placard indicating this requirement is located on the CAT indicator and in the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).|$|R
5000|$|The Calais was {{extensively}} restyled for 1967. Prominent styling {{features were}} given a powerful frontal appearance with [...] "forward-leaning" [...] front end, long sculptured body lines, and redefined rear fenders that had {{more than just a}} hint of tail fins in them. The full-width forward-thrust [...] "eggcrate" [...] grille was flanked by dual stacked headlights for the third consecutive year. The squarer cornered grille insert had blades that seemed to emphasize its vertical members and it appeared both above the bumper and through a horizontal slot cut into it. Rectangular parking lamps were built into the outer edges of the grille. Rear end styling revisions were highlighted by metal divided taillamps and a painted lower bumper section. For 1967, power windows became standard on the Calais line, although power seats were still optional even in the later-year models. Coupes got a new roofline, inspired by the Florentine show car created for the 1964 New York World's Fair, that gave rear seat passengers added privacy. As on that show car, the quarter window glass retracted rearward into a sail panel. New standard Calais features included non-glare rear-view mirror, electric clock, Automatic Climate Controls, padded dashboard, Hazard Warning system, outboard seatbelt retractors and rear cigarette lighters in all styles. A slide-out fuse box and safety front seat back lock for two-door models were additional Cadillac advances for the 1967 model year. Technical improvements included a revised engine <b>valve</b> train, different <b>carburetor,</b> Mylar printed circuit instrument panel, re-tuned body mounts, and a new engine fan with clutch for quieter operation. An energy absorbing steering column became optional. 1967 was the last model year for pillared sedans.|$|R

2500|$|The P-47M {{was a more}} {{conservative}} attempt {{to come up with}} a higher-performance ("Sprint") version of the Thunderbolt, designed to chase V-1 flying bombs, done, in part, by reducing armament from eight [...]50-caliber Colt-Browning M2 machine guns to six. In September 1944, four P-47D-27-RE airframes (42-27385/27388) were modified into prototype YP-47Ms by fitting the R-2800-57 engine and the GE CH-5 turbo-supercharger, a combination which could produce 2,800hp (2,089kW) at [...] when using Wartime Emergency Power (water injection). Air brakes were added to the wing's lower surfaces to allow braking after a dive onto its prey. The YP-47M had a top speed of 473mph (410kn, 761km/h) and it was put into limited production with 133 (sufficient for one group) built.
