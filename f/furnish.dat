40|$|In the European Union, {{conventional}} cages for {{laying hens}} will be faded {{out at the}} beginning of 2012. The rationale behind this is a public concern over animal welfare in egg production. As alternatives to conventional cages, the European Union Council Directive 1999 / 74 / EC allows non-cage systems and enriched (<b>furnished)</b> cages. Layer performance, behavior, and welfare in differently sized <b>furnished</b> cages have been investigated quite widely during recent decades, but nutrition of hens in this production system has received less attention. This thesis aims to compare production and feed intake of laying hens in <b>furnished</b> and conventional cages and to study the effects of different dietary treatments in these production systems, thus contributing to the general knowledge of <b>furnished</b> cages as an egg production system. A <b>furnished</b> cage model for 8 hens was compared with a 3 -hen conventional cage. Three consecutive experiments each studied one aspect of layer diet: The first experiment investigated the effects of dietary protein/energy ratio, the second dietary energy levels, and the third the effects of extra limestone supplementation. In addition, a fourth experiment evaluated the effects of perches on feed consumption and behavior of hens in <b>furnished</b> cages. The dietary treatments in experiments 1 – 3 generally had similar effects in the two cage types. Thus, there was no evidence supporting a change in nutrient requirements for laying hens when conventional cages are replaced with small-group <b>furnished</b> cages. Moreover, the results from nutritional experiments conducted in conventional cages can be applied to smallgroup <b>furnished</b> cage systems. These results support the view that production performance comparable with conventional cages can be achieved in <b>furnished</b> cages. All of the advantages of cages for bird welfare are sustained in the smallgroup <b>furnished</b> cages used here. In addition, frequent use of perches and nests implies a wider behavioral repertoire in <b>furnished</b> cages than in conventional cages. The increase observed in bone ash content may improve bird welfare in <b>furnished</b> cages. The presence of perches diminished feed consumption during the prelaying period and enhanced the feed conversion ratio during the early laying period in <b>furnished</b> cages. However, as {{the presence or absence of}} perches in <b>furnished</b> cages had no significant effect on feed consumption after the prelaying period, the lower feed consumption observed in <b>furnished</b> cages than in conventional cages could be attributed to other factors, such as the presence of wood shavings or a nest box. The wider feed trough space per hen in conventional than in <b>furnished</b> cages may partly explain the higher feed consumption observed in conventional cages. ...|$|R

5|$|After {{the death}} of Manuel I and the {{subsequent}} demise of the Komnenian dynasty in 1185, the navy declined swiftly. The maintenance of galleys and the upkeep of proficient crews were very expensive, and neglect led to a rapid deterioration of the fleet. Already by 1182 the Byzantines had to pay Venetian mercenaries to crew some of their galleys, but in the 1180s, as {{the bulk of the}} Komnenian naval establishment persisted, expeditions of 70–100 ships are still recorded in contemporary sources. Thus Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos (1183–1185) could still gather 100 warships in 1185 to resist and later defeat a Norman fleet in the Sea of Marmara. However, the subsequent peace treaty included a clause which required the Normans to <b>furnish</b> a fleet for the Empire. This, together with a similar agreement made by Isaac II Angelos (1185–1195 and 1203–1204) with Venice the next year, in which the Republic would provide 40–100 galleys at six months' notice in exchange for favourable trading concessions, is a telling indication that the Byzantine government was aware of the inadequacy of its own naval establishment.|$|E
