5000|$|The term [...] "kill zone" [...] {{is used in}} paintball {{tactics to}} {{designate}} {{an area that is}} heavily defended by enemy paintball players. Advancing players may know the location of the potential <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> but be uncertain whether it is well-defended. Responses vary to being caught in a paintball <b>kill</b> <b>zone.</b> If the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> is too large and the enemy forces relatively far away, the ambushed players often retreat to cover. If the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> is small, the ambushed players are likely to charge forward and assault the defensive players. Fellow players who are not caught in the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> are likely to attack the flanks of the defensive players.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> should isolate and {{trap the}} enemy. The {{selection}} of a likely <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> involves evaluating the terrain and making up for any inadequacies. First and foremost, the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> must be where the enemy is expected to travel, or where the enemy can be attracted with [...] "bait". If the potential <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> terrain restricts vehicle movement to one vehicle width at a time, then a suddenly disabled vehicle will help to isolate the enemy. Terrain that keeps the enemy from {{moving out of the}} <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> is useful for isolation, otherwise the ambushers will wish to place obstacles or munitions at the borders of the selected area. Especially important is separation between the enemy and the ambushing units, to prevent a counterattack.|$|R
50|$|The first arrow is {{shot from}} the red peg (or {{sometimes}} wasp peg for compound). A hit in the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> scores 20 points (sometimes 24 if an inner <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> is being used). A hit in the wound zone (anywhere outside the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> but not on antlers or base, or within wound lines on 2D targets) scores 16 points.|$|R
5000|$|V-shaped, {{when the}} firing units are {{distant from the}} <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> at the end where the enemy enters, so the firing units lay down bands of {{intersecting}} and interlocking fire. This ambush is normally triggered only when the enemy is well into the <b>kill</b> <b>zone.</b> The intersecting bands of fire prevent any attempt of {{moving out of the}} <b>kill</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> is {{an element}} of point ambush in which a {{military}} unit targets a single area with defensive fire such as mines, demolitions and guns. The <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> may be bordered by obstacles, traps or indirect fire (artillery or mortars) to keep the enemy from escaping. In an area ambush, related multiple <b>kill</b> <b>zones</b> will be covered by multiple defensive units. The weapons of the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> are not fired until the majority of the enemy unit is within the <b>kill</b> <b>zone,</b> ideally all of the targeted unit. Defensive fire is initiated by the defensive unit leader who orders the most devastating weapons to be engaged, followed immediately by other weapons. The initial attack may be remote-controlled charges such as Claymore mines or other explosives. The ambushed unit may be prevented from advancing or retreating by explosions at the front and rear of their column. Machine gun and small arms fire may be augmented by indirect fire. Ideally, the action is completed so quickly that the enemy force has no time to report the engagement. A successful ambush may result in a patrol in the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> being destroyed in seconds. The ambush of a <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> carries high risk in that forces not in the zone may maneuver around the flanks of the attackers, limiting their escape. Nearby forces may also come to the assistance of those caught in the attack. For this reason, a well-executed attack may be over in under a minute and rarely extends beyond a few minutes.|$|R
50|$|In the US, <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> {{diameter}}s {{vary from}} {{a minimum of}} 0.375 inches (9.525 mm), to a typical <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> diameter at distance of 1-1/2 inches (3.81 cm). Occasionally, <b>kill</b> <b>zones</b> to the maximum allowed 2 inches (5.08 cm) are used. The ranges of the targets must be between 10 yards (9.1 m) and 55 yards (50.3 m), and they are arranged in lanes of 1 to 3 targets. Kneeling and standing shots are also the norm at every match but not as large {{a percentage of the}} match as in the UK. Hunter class has also started with a very strong following.|$|R

25|$|L-shaped ambushes {{included}} {{the most effective}} aspects of both the 'Bloody Nose' and Linear ambush. The short end, or base, of the 'L' was positioned so {{that at least one}} machine gun could fire straight down the <b>kill</b> <b>zone,</b> enfilading it. Parallel to the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> and tied into the 'L' was a second, flanking ambush.|$|R
50|$|In {{military}} tactics, the <b>kill</b> <b>zone,</b> {{also known}} as killing zone, is an area entirely covered by defensive fire, an element of ambush within which an approaching enemy force is trapped and destroyed. The objective of the defensive force is to quickly kill or capture all enemy soldiers inside the <b>kill</b> <b>zone.</b> The trapped soldiers may respond by counterattacking.|$|R

5000|$|Military {{units on}} the move are {{vulnerable}} to ambush. To avoid the <b>kill</b> <b>zone,</b> a patrol may [...] "fan out" [...] and travel with elements spread out left and right, rather than staying solely on a road or track. Soldiers who take point must {{keep an eye out}} for signs of a <b>kill</b> <b>zone,</b> such as disturbed ground, obstacles and restrictive terrain. Night vision and thermal imaging equipment may help to discover hidden weapons, or enemy soldiers under cover.|$|R
5000|$|L-shaped, when a short leg {{of firing}} units are placed to enfilade (fire the length of) {{the sides of}} the linear <b>kill</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{military}} {{unit that}} finds itself suddenly under fire in an enemy <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> must immediately {{take action against}} the ambushers. Such action may include soldiers assuming a prone position to minimize themselves as targets. Prone soldiers will return fire toward the ambushers. Other responses may include the targeted soldiers immediately assaulting suspected defensive positions. Soldiers outside of the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> may direct suppressive fire at the ambushers {{in support of the}} assault, and they may advance upon the flanks of the ambushers.|$|R

5000|$|The court {{distinguished}} {{murder and}} attempted murder in that [...] "transferred intent {{does not apply}} to attempted murder", in that if a defendant intends to kill one person but instead kills another by the act, then the defendant is guilt of murder because the intent to kill transfers. But if the defendant attempts to kill a target and fails to kill anyone in the <b>kill</b> <b>zone,</b> the intent to kill the target does not transfer to others in the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> as an attempted murder.|$|R

50|$|Upon {{detection}} of a launch, or a laser range finder illumination, the system mostly likely triggers a salvo of infrared smoke grenades launched from this vehicle {{and the presidential}} limo to provide both a visual smoke screen in the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> and to also act as an obscurant for IR and radar guided attacks. This can be assumed, since {{it is known that}} the presidential limo is equipped with a driver's vision enhancer system which gives the driver the ability to drive in an infrared smoke environment. The visual obscurants would give the secure package the ability to leave the <b>kill</b> <b>zone,</b> leaving the counter-assault team (CAT) to deal with the threat.|$|R
