5|$|Following {{his release}} from prison, Shakur signed to <b>Death</b> <b>Row</b> Records on October 15, 1995. Bad Boy Records and <b>Death</b> <b>Row,</b> now {{business}} rivals, became involved in an intense quarrel.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, word {{of other}} {{collaborators}} who {{have contributed to}} Dr.Dre's work has surfaced. During his tenure at <b>Death</b> <b>Row</b> Records, it was alleged that Dr.Dre's stepbrother Warren G and Tha Dogg Pound member Daz made many uncredited contributions to songs on his solo album The Chronic and Snoop Doggy Dogg's album Doggystyle (Daz received production credits on Snoop's similar-sounding, albeit less successful album Tha Doggfather after Young left <b>Death</b> <b>Row</b> Records).|$|E
5|$|A more {{contemporary}} prison artist was Dennis (NOZ) Nozworthy, who {{stated that he}} found art on <b>death</b> <b>row,</b> in 1982. Some of his work currently is held in the collections of Curtin University, Perth Central TAFE, and the WA Government, Department of Justice.|$|E

5|$|As more {{information}} about Burge's reign was published, activists worked to save some Chicago inmates on <b>death</b> <b>row</b> {{who claimed to have}} been wrongfully convicted. In 1998, representatives from the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Chicago Law School, the London-based International Center for Criminal Law and Human Rights, law professor Anthony Amsterdam, former federal judges George N. Leighton and Abner Mikva, Illinois judge R. Eugene Pincham, and British activist Bianca Jagger, called for a stay of execution for Aaron Patterson, a <b>death</b> <b>row</b> inmate from Chicago. His conviction for murder was based primarily on a confession which he claimed was coerced by torture from Burge and his officers.|$|E
5|$|Cordray {{was granted}} a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that lower courts could not grant a stay of {{execution}} for a <b>death</b> <b>row</b> inmate. At the same time, Fisher, Cordray's boss, sought a referendum to mandate that appeals in death penalty cases be made directly to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Steffen v. Tate (39 F.3d 622 1994) limited <b>death</b> <b>row</b> inmates to a single federal appeal and said that federal courts cannot stay an execution if the case is still in a state court.|$|E
5|$|From 1987 to 1996, Dr. Dre dated singer Michel'le, who {{frequently}} contributed vocals to Ruthless Records and <b>Death</b> <b>Row</b> Records albums. In 1991, {{the couple had}} a son, Marcel.|$|E

50|$|Following {{his guest}} {{appearances}} on The Chronic and Doggystyle, RBX was tagged to be <b>Death</b> <b>Row’s</b> next big star, {{but that was}} not to be—Dr. Dre and Suge Knight pushed back his debut, and he wound up leaving the label and putting out the album on Premeditated Records.|$|R
5|$|In 1991 Abu-Jamal {{published}} {{an essay in}} the Yale Law Journal, {{on the death penalty}} and his <b>death</b> <b>row</b> experience. In May 1994, Abu-Jamal was engaged by National Public Radio's All Things Considered program to deliver a series of monthly three-minute commentaries on crime and punishment. The broadcast plans and commercial arrangement were canceled following condemnations from, among others, the Fraternal Order of Police and US Senator Bob Dole (Kansas Republican Party). Abu-Jamal sued NPR for not airing his work, but a federal judge dismissed the suit. His commentaries later were published in May 1995 as part of Live from <b>Death</b> <b>Row.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Governor Ryan {{placed a}} {{moratorium}} on executions in Illinois after courts exonerated and freed 13 <b>death</b> <b>row</b> inmates who had been wrongfully convicted. Ryan also promised to review the cases of all Illinois <b>death</b> <b>row</b> inmates. Given {{the number of cases}} of alleged brutality to be investigated, inmates who claimed to have been abused and gave coerced confessions were offered reduced sentences in exchange for dropping charges. A plea agreement was reached with one convicted victim. Illinois State's Attorney Devine made a broader offer to several inmates. Aaron Patterson rejected the plea deal.|$|E
5|$|In August 2000, the Illinois Supreme Court {{reversed}} or remanded two Burge-related <b>death</b> <b>row</b> cases {{based on}} allegations of torture by police. The {{court ruled that}} the inmates should have new hearings.|$|E

5000|$|SCI Rockview, {{which began}} in 1912 and was {{completed}} in 1915, was intended to replace Eastern State Penitentiary and Western Penitentiary. Instead it became a branch prison of Western housing lesser security risk prisoners employed in the extensive farm program outside the gates. Rockview is now a medium-security institution for men. Pennsylvania's execution chamber {{is located on the}} grounds of Rockview; however, there is no [...] "death row" [...] there. Condemned prisoners are transported to Rockview from <b>death</b> <b>rows</b> in maximum security prisons across the state several days before their scheduled execution.|$|R
5|$|In February 1999, David Protess, a Northwestern University journalism professor, and his {{students}} were studying cases of people on <b>death</b> <b>row.</b> They discovered evidence related to <b>Death</b> <b>Row</b> inmate Anthony Porter that might help exonerate him. The students produced four affidavits and a videotaped statement that attributed guilt for the crime to another suspect. They obtained recantations by some witnesses of their testimony at trial. One witness claimed that he named Anthony Porter as a suspect only after police officers threatened, harassed and intimidated him into doing so.|$|E
5|$|After {{a dispute}} with Eazy-E, Dre left the group {{at the peak of}} its {{popularity}} in 1991 under the advice of friend, and N.W.A lyricist, The D.O.C. and his bodyguard at the time, Suge Knight. Knight, a notorious strongman and intimidator, was able to have Eazy-E release Young from his contract and, using Dr.Dre as his flagship artist, founded <b>Death</b> <b>Row</b> Records. In 1992 Young released his first single, the title track to the film Deep Cover, a collaboration with rapper Snoop Dogg, whom he met through Warren G. Dr.Dre's debut solo album was The Chronic, released under <b>Death</b> <b>Row</b> Records with Suge Knight as executive producer. Young ushered in a new style of rap, both in terms of musical style and lyrical content, including introducing a number of artists to the industry including Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, Daz Dillinger, RBX, The Lady of Rage, Nate Dogg and Jewell.|$|E
5|$|Amanda Trippley (Amanda Boxer) is the {{neurotic}} music teacher. Throughout the series, she invents her {{pupils to}} prevent her department being closed, uses the school's telephone network to surf the internet about Star Trek, and demands the return of a musical instrument from a former pupil now on <b>death</b> <b>row.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Innocence Protection Act is {{the first}} federal death penalty reform to be enacted. The United States Supreme Court in 1972 {{suspended}} use of existing death penalty statutes because of inconsistencies in how they were applied. It ordered the states to pass new legislation to address its concern, and affirmec a case in 1976 under new law, essentially allowing states to again sentence convicted persons to death under their laws. But by 2002, more than 100 people have been released from <b>death</b> <b>rows</b> across the United States after {{it was found that}} they were wrongfully convicted because of procedural errors or newly discovered evidence of their innocence.|$|R

50|$|Cortez and his {{two female}} assistants, Sybil (Penny Brown) and Sarah (Eleanor Gold) receive a video message from the mysterious station boss, Sam, {{demanding}} that they recreate the formula of gladiatorial contest and set them {{back to where they}} began: in the Coliseum. Sam orders the WBS station, a sort-of flying saucer controlled by a computer system called Junior, to fly over there and initiate training of the future contestants who will be chosen from the <b>Death</b> <b>Rows</b> around the world. Meanwhile, Drake has been imprisoned for the murder of three men who killed his wife Susan (Valerie Jones) after they broke into his house, and he (conveniently for WBS) is now under the sentence of death for taking the law in his own hands.|$|R
5|$|His {{publications}} include Death Blossoms: Reflections from a Prisoner of Conscience, {{in which}} he explores religious themes; All Things Censored, a political critique examining issues of crime and punishment; Live From <b>Death</b> <b>Row,</b> a diary of life on Pennsylvania's death row; and We Want Freedom: A Life in the Black Panther Party, {{a history of the}} Black Panthers drawing on autobiographical material.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Ryan {{had already}} pardoned four <b>death</b> <b>row</b> inmates: Madison Hobley, Aaron Patterson, Leroy Orange and Stanley Howard, who {{were among the}} ten who claimed they were coerced into confessing by Burge and his {{officers}} and had been wrongfully convicted. In the unusual proceeding, the governor took the extraordinary step of a direct pardon release rather than a court proceeding.|$|E
5|$|On March 26, 2012 the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania {{rejected}} {{his appeal}} for retrial that asserted, {{based on a}} 2009 report by the National Academy of Science, that forensic evidence presented by the prosecution and accepted into evidence in the original trial was unreliable. It {{was reported to be}} the former <b>death</b> <b>row</b> inmate's last legal appeal.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, Hospira {{announced}} that it would stop manufacturing sodium thiopental, due to use by American prisons for executions. [...] "Virtually all" [...] <b>death</b> <b>rows</b> in the US were left without a steady supply of the drug, which is used to numb the pain of potassium chloride stopping the heart. Some states bartered supplies of execution drugs, while other states were accused of illegally buying drugs from India and other sources. The Drug Enforcement Administration seized supplies of sodium thiopental from several states in spring and summer 2011, questioning how they were imported. [...] Other manufacturers have also refused to provide pharmaceutical drugs for the purpose of execution, and a European export ban added to problems obtaining the necessary drugs.|$|R
5000|$|After the 1997 {{decision}} to legalize lethal injection {{as a form}} of execution, PRC officials began using execution vans across China. Becoming popular in 2006, these officials state that the vans are cost-effective by allowing communities without the money to build dedicated <b>death</b> <b>rows</b> to kill prisoners without the costs associated with sending prisoners away for death. Former Chinese judge and current lawyer Qiu Xingsheng argues that [...] "some places can't afford the cost of sending a person to Beijing—perhaps $250—plus $125 more for the drug." [...] Because Beijing is the only place where the drug is manufactured, the vans have allowed localities to administer the death sentence where the crime took place. Estimates place the number of execution vans in operation at around 40; the PRC has not confirmed this number.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the night}} of September 7, 1996, Shakur {{attended}} the Bruce Seldon vs. Mike Tyson boxing match with Suge Knight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada. After leaving the match, one of Knight's associates spotted Orlando [...] "Baby Lane" [...] Anderson, an alleged Crips gang member from Compton, California, in the MGM Grand lobby. Earlier that year, Anderson {{and a group of}} Crips had robbed a member of <b>Death</b> <b>Row's</b> entourage in a Foot Locker store. Knight's associate told Shakur, who attacked Anderson. Shakur's entourage, as well as Knight and his followers, assisted in assaulting Anderson. The fight was captured on the hotel's video surveillance. After the brawl, Shakur went with Knight to Death Row–owned Club 662 (now known as restaurant/club Seven). Shakur rode in Knight's 1996 black BMW 750iL sedan {{as part of a larger}} convoy, which included many in Shakur's entourage.|$|R
5|$|Sandra Jean Weaver, 19, a Wisconsin {{native who}} {{had been living in}} Tooele, Utah, was last seen in Salt Lake City on July 1, 1974; her nude body was {{discovered}} the following day near Grand Junction, Colorado. Sources conflict on whether Bundy mentioned Weaver's name during the <b>death</b> <b>row</b> interviews. Her murder remains unsolved.|$|E
5|$|The Chronic is {{the debut}} studio album by American hip hop {{recording}} artist Dr. Dre. It {{was released on}} December 15, 1992, by his own record label <b>Death</b> <b>Row</b> Records and distributed by Interscope Records and Priority Records. Recording sessions for the album took place in June 1992 at <b>Death</b> <b>Row</b> Studios in Los Angeles and at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood. The album is named after a slang term for high-grade cannabis, and its cover is a homage to Zig-Zag rolling papers. It was Dr. Dre's first solo album after he had departed from hip hop group N.W.A and its label Ruthless Records over a financial dispute. On The Chronic, he included both subtle and direct insults at Ruthless and its owner, former N.W.A member Eazy-E. Although a solo album, it features many appearances by Snoop Dogg, who used the album as a launch pad for his own solo career.|$|E
5|$|An unusual slapstick mix of film noir, black {{comedy and}} B-movie conventions, the film portrays bizarre {{situations}} involving a <b>death</b> <b>row</b> inmate. The film was a box-office flop, {{and has since}} fallen into obscurity outside of fans of Campbell and Raimi. Few critics reviewed the film, though the little amount of critical attention it received was mostly negative. Several elements of the film influenced later productions by Raimi, {{and the failure of}} Crimewave directly led to the inception of Evil Dead II (1987). The film has achieved the status of a minor cult film.|$|E
40|$|Decisions {{in capital}} cases have {{increasingly}} become campaign fodder in both judicial and nonjudicial elections. The focus in these campaigns {{has been almost}} entirely on the gruesome facts of particular murders, not {{the reason for the}} judicial decisions. Judges have come under attack and have been removed from the bench for their decisions in capital caseswith perhaps the most notable examples in states with some of the largest <b>death</b> <b>rows</b> and where the death penalty has been a dominant political issue. Recent challenges to state court judges in both direct and retention elections {{have made it clear that}} unpopular decisions in capital cases, even when clearly compelled by law, may cost a judge her seat on the bench, or promotion to a higher court. This raises serious questions about the independence and integrity of the judiciary and the ability of judges to enforce the Bill of Rights and otherwise be fair and impartial in capital cases...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the paucity}} of {{research}} on the death penalty and gender discrimination, it is widely supposed that women murderers are chivalrously spared the death sentence. This supposition is fueled by the relatively small number of women who are condemned. This article argues that women are represented on contemporary U. S. <b>death</b> <b>rows</b> in numbers commensurate with the infrequency of female commission of those crimes which our society labels sufficiently reprehensible to merit capital punishment. Additionally, preliminary investigation suggests that death-sentenced women are more likely than death-sentenced men to have killed intimates, although the explanation for this disparity is not yet at hand. It is further argued, {{on the basis of a}} content analysis of state capital statutes, that there is a form of gender bias inimical to the interests of women in our capital punishment law: The death penalty is a dramatic symbol of the imputation of greater seriousness to economic and other predatory murder as compared with domestic murder...|$|R
