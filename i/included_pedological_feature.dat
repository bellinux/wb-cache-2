40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of stratigraphic excavation and soil studies carried out at Mograt Island, the largest of the Nilotic islands in Sudan. Due to its restricted insular environments, Holocene alluvial deposits were observed to be interlocked with archaeological remains of different periods, allowing for a combined chronostratigraphic approach to study both cultural and climatic events. To better understand the environmental context through soil components and <b>pedological</b> <b>features</b> at a microscopic scale, soil block samples were accordingly collected and studied by the application of soil micromorphology. This approach provides insights into the history of Nile terrace aggradation through the suspension of Nile sediment loads under stillwater conditions {{as well as of the}} periodical establishment of shallow water pools at the islands′ plateaus by the surface run-off from local rains.

40|$|Redox processes, {{which are}} {{widespread}} in soils, {{need to be}} quantified for an improved comprehension {{of the dynamics of}} Fe- and Mn-oxides and their associated trace elements. The classical methodology used to study these redox processes generally relies on the quantification of all mineral species in the various <b>pedological</b> <b>features</b> that can be related to different redox stages. However, this approach usually encounters the difficulty of precisely quantifying the different forms of poorly crystallised Fe- and Mn-oxides. In this study, we use the signature of rare earth elements (REEs) to visualise and, eventually, quantify the importance of redox processes in soils. Our approach relies on that developed by Laveuf et al. (2008) and the idea that the relative contribution to the mobilisation of REEs that is made by the primary minerals reactive to redox conditions depends on the following factors: (i) their initial proportion in the different <b>pedological</b> <b>features</b> that can be related to various redox processes, (ii) their relative mobilisation during the redox process in question, and (iii) their initial REE signatures. The catena studied is characterised by two stages of redox conditions: the first is related to the formation and subsequent dissolution of Fe-Mn concretions, and the second is related to the bleaching of the soil matrix due to morphological degradation. In this soil, the main minerals reactive to redox conditions are Mn-oxides, ferrihydrite, goethite and (fluor) apatite. The results indicate that the primary redox conditions can be characterised by a positive Ce anomaly on the REE pattern, which has been attributed to a preferential immobilisation of this element, due to its association with Mn-oxides. The results also indicate that the secondary redox conditions can be characterised by depletion in medium REEs (MREEs) in the REE pattern, which has been attributed to a preferential release of these elements during the dissolution of (fluor) apatite and, to a lesser extent, of ferrihydrite. These results emphasise the potential of REE signatures of the visualisation of the various redox processes that have been active in a soil. Additionally, REE signatures are a proxy of the frequency and intensity of the redox conditions...|$|R
40|$|Indurated {{volcanic}} soils (tepetates) of the Mexican Altiplano display thick columnar horizons, hard laminar horizons, and grey mottles at depth. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies show a relative enrichment in cristobalite vs. halloysite in the indurated plates of the laminar horizons {{and in the}} clay fraction of the mottles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) studies of these two soil components have shown that they are composed of small tubes of halloysite in which numerous globular grains of approximately 1 micrometer in diameter are embedded. Based on the relative abundance of cristobalite in <b>pedological</b> <b>features</b> and on the spatial relations between successive mineral phases, we interpret the cristobalite as a transformation of halloysite with a transitional amorphous phase. In the globular grains, large platy 1 : 1 clay minerals undergo a progressive transformation into platy particles of opal-A and opal-C. These are in turn transformed into cristobalite without further major change in their shape and appearance, except for a higher electron density than opal and clay. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the study of a set of lithic assemblages brought to light in the last 20 years along the Southern margin of the Po Plain, between the cities of Bologna and Piacenza. Geological studies and pollen {{analyses}} support an Early Holocene age for these open-air sites and indicate that they were located along the ancient river banks of some main tributaries of the Po river. Due to the <b>pedological</b> <b>features</b> of these deposits, lithic assemblages represent the dominant archaeological finds uncovered. The application of both a technological and a typological approach to the study of these assemblages therefore represents a unique opportunity to examine aspects related to the occupation of this area in the early Holocene. Our study indicates that the lithic assemblages analysed share several aspects allowing them to be referred to the same cultural complex (i. e. Sauveterrian, Early Mesolithic of Northern Italy).

Inconsistencies are demonstrated in the current indicators used for assessment of waterlogging potential across agricultural landscapes as well as in parameters measured in waterlogging studies. It is suggested that predictions of waterlogging potential for landscapes should be based on a minimum dataset that <b>includes</b> <b>pedological,</b> topographical, and climate data for the defined area, as well as observations of plant morphological appearance and visible surface water. The review also summarises the effects of low oxygen concentration in soil on rhizosphere processes, and discusses evidence for direct effects on plant physiology of reductions in soil oxygen caused by waterlogging. Finally, the review describes current crop growth, water use, and yield simulation models used in Australia (SWAGMAN, DRAINMOD, and APSIM) that incorporate waterlogging stress. It is suggested that there is scope for modifications to these models based on recent improved understanding of plant physiological responses to waterlogging and on further research. The review concludes that improvements in modelling waterlogging outcomes to assist growth and yield predictions should ultimately enhance management capacity for growers. Ruth E. Shaw, Wayne S.

Within this context, {{the aim of this}} work was to evaluate the consequences of the irrational use of irrigated systems under different conditions of soils, cropping, and management. We studied micromorphological properties of calcareous soils, using microanalysis techniques for different situations of management in an irrigated area located in the Apodi Plateau, state of Ceara, Brazil. We selected four cultivated areas and their respective native vegetation areas. The selection criteria considered the time of use, cropping regime (annual=corn and beans in succession and perennial=bananas, grass and guava) and irrigation systems (microsprinkler or central pivot).

40|$|A multi-disciplinary {{approach}} was followed to investigate two thick palaeosol strata that alternate with wind-blown dominated deposits developed along the Alghero coast (North-west Sardinia, Italy). Optically stimulated luminescence ages reveal that both palaeosols were developed during cooler drier periods: {{the first one}} at around 70 ka Marine Isotope Stage 4 and the latter around 50 ka (Marine Isotope Stage 3). In contrast, the <b>pedological</b> <b>features</b> indicate that the palaeosols underwent heavy weathering processes under warm humid to sub-humid conditions, characteristic of the Sardinian climate during the last interglacial stage (Marine Isotope Stage 5 e). To reconcile this apparent data discrepancy, a range of sedimentological and pedological analyses were conducted. These analyses reveal that the palaeosols possess a complex history, with accumulation and weathering occurring during Marine Isotope Stage 5 e, and erosion, colluviation and final deposition taking place during the following cold stages. Thus, even if these reddish palaeosols were last formed during the glacial period, the sediments building up these strata probably record the climate of the last interglacial stage (Marine Isotope Stage 5 e). Trace element and X-ray diffraction analyses, together with scanning electron microscope images, reveal the presence of Saharan dust in the parent material of the palaeosols. However, {{no evidence of any}} far-travelled African dust has been observed in the Marine Isotope Stage 4 – 3 aeolian deposits. It is possible to conclude that in the West Mediterranean islands, Saharan dust input, even if of modest magnitude, is preserved preferentially in soils accumulated and weathered during interglacial stages...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Soil Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} and identify the occurrence of specific soil properties that may be important for vegetation functioning and the possible effect of the loss of or changes in these properties on rehabilitation success on the sandy coastal plains of the West Coast, South Africa. The study area covered approximately 9 400 ha on the Namaqualand coast in the vicinity of Brand-se-Baai (31 º 18 'S 17 º 54 'E), approximately 350 km north of Cape Town and 70 km north-west of the nearest town, Lutzville. A soil survey was done to reveal the presence of important <b>pedological</b> <b>features.</b> The 20 soil profiles surveyed are situated within six vegetation communities. <b>Pedological</b> <b>features</b> such as surface water repellency, permeable apedal subsurface horizons, subsurface impediments such as cemented (calcrete or dorbank) hardpans and significantly more clayey (cutanic, luvic) horizons were identified. A comparative study between rehabilitated and natural soils indicates that mining operations result in the formation of saline sand tailings, stripped of a large portion of the clay and organic matter fraction. The natural leaching of solutes, over a period of 25 months, is sufficient to lower salinity of the tailings to levels comparable to natural soils. This leaching can also results in lowering of soil fertility. Removal of the dorbank and the dense neocutanic horizon in the western side of the mine, loss of topographical features such as small dune systems and heuweltjies, destruction of natural soil profile morphology and the lowering of organic carbon and clay plus silt fraction can have detrimental effects on attempts at rehabilitation of this area to a natural condition similar to that which preceded the mining operation. Infiltration fingering and deep percolation results in the development of an aquifer below the reach of shallow-rooted desert shrubs. A method of water acquisition by vegetation through water distillation is investigated as a possible solution to the apparent discontinuum between the shallow root systems and deeper-lying aquifer. Volumetric water content measurements indicated that precipitation of 29. 5 mm, over a period of 10 days, did not result in any variation at 235 mm, 360 mm and 900 mm depths. An average volumetric water content increase of 0. 4 mm per night was measured in the first 23. 5 cm of soil surface. This amount is a significant source of water that can explain the shallow root distribution. Water vapour movement due to temperature gradients can explain the diurnal volumetric water content fluctuations observed. Further studies are necessary to determine to what extent the depth of water infiltration influences the capacity of subsurface dew to provide plants with a nocturnal water source. Findings of this study can be summarised into two concepts namely: • Heuweltjies, small dune systems, and variation in depth of cemented hardpans are the main features that contribute to pedosphere variation and possibly to biodiversity. • Pedogenic features such as topsoil hydrophobicity, and cemented dorbank and dense more clayey (cutanic, luvic) subsurface horizons are important components of a soil water distillation process that could be a driving force behind vegetation functioning in this region. Mine activities result in the loss of certain pedogenic features and soil properties that that could be key ingredients to ecosystem functioning. The inability to recognise their significance and ignorance thereof when planning rehabilitation methods might prevent sustainable restoration of the environment...|$|R

40|$|Because {{volcanic}} soils store {{large amounts of}} soil organic carbon (SOC), they play a far more {{important role in the}} carbon (C) cycle than their limited global coverage suggests. We analysed the C released as CO 2 from a range of {{volcanic soils}} under natural conditions and analysed the influence of environmental variables (moisture and temperature), substrate availability (as assessed from the contents of various SOC fractions and the inputs of plant residues from litterfall), respiratory agents (roots, microorganisms and decomposing enzymes) and other <b>pedological</b> <b>features</b> of the topsoils (0 - 30 cm depth) on the CO 2 efflux rates over a 2 -year experimental period. High CO 2 efflux rates (419 g C-CO 2 m(- 2) y(- 1) as the average for Andisols) were obtained that were related to significant decreases in the amount of SOC stored. CO 2 release was strongly controlled by soil moisture, although it was inhibited in the Andisols with the highest moisture levels (above 50 kg m- 2 in topsoil). It was not responsive to the availability of decomposing microorganisms or enzymes and appeared more related to the inputs of easily decomposable plant residues than to the amount of either labile or recalcitrant SOC. Among the SOC pools, only the water-soluble C in saturated paste extracts (WSCse) of air-dried soil samples was consistently correlated with the CO 2 efflux rates. The desiccation of Andisols appeared to induce the release of previously stabilised SOC, which was readily mineralised when the moisture conditions became favourable. The results {{of this study indicate that}} SOC storage in Andisols is highly vulnerable to drying-wetting processes even in unmanaged natural ecosystems and that microclimate conditions can be critical for successful C sequestration in these soils...|$|R

This report describes climatic history especially in the Middle Ages and later centuries (Chap. 2), coastal development (Chap. 3), geology (Chap. 4); human influences on relief and soil (Chap. 5), being 'decision variables' for geomorphological and <b>pedological</b> <b>features.</b> An explanation of dune-forming mechanisms is followed by a classification of dune forms (Chap. 6). Also {{a brief description of the}} Dutch coastal dunes is given in relation to the geomorphological map (scale 1 : 100 000, App. IV). Further some attention is given to the ecological features of dune slacks, and also some remarks are made on nature management. Chapter 7 is focused on the sudden origin of the 'Younger Dunes' in the Netherlands and the existence of three major phases in their development. The major part of the dunes proved to result from secondary dune-forming processes, for which the most probable cause is coastal erosion. There seems to be a cause-effect relation between climatic changes, phases of coastal erosion and phases of secondary duneforming. Chapter 8 gives an outline of the main soil forming processes like the development of a humus-layer and leaching of compounds like carbonates as an introduction on the ecologically important moisture and nutrient conditions in dune soils.

The presence of illegal waste dumps with Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs) could threaten both environmental {{safety and the}} agricultural activities. Research is currently underway aiming to evaluate the environmental conditions and present and potential agronomic quality of the soils. This study deals with the occurrence and distribution of Pb in soils with reference to different <b>pedological</b> <b>features.</b> An extensive survey of soil profiles and core top-subsoils was carried out. Soil genesis and evolution {{would appear to be}} affected by various, mainly natural, factors, such as the variability/dynamics of sediments connected with river digression, flow regime and flooding, but also human, through the land reclamation of marsh areas. Classified pedotypes vary from Entisols to Vertisols. The former are seen in the areas near the Volturno riverbanks — frequently rejuvenated by flooding materials — the latter in stabilized inner areas that are far from riverbed. In the study area, several illegal waste dumps with toxic/harmful slag have been discovered causing a great stir and scaremongering and bringing the agricultural land image into disrepute. Despite this critical situation, soil Pb concentration in agricultural soils is low (range 0. 4 – 90 mg kg − 1, mean value 21. 8 mg kg − 1) consistent with the natural background, and below both reference literature and the contamination threshold (100 mg kg − 1) sanctioned by current laws. Our results also revealed that: i) Pb concentrations show wide spatial variability, and are randomly distributed among topsoils and subsoils; ii) Pb distribution along soil profiles is clearly irregular, linked to natural pedological heterogeneities, such as buried horizons and/or changes of soil organic matter (OM), clay and CaCO 3 contents, and, consequently, of Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC); and iii) OM and the fine-size fraction are the main natural sinks of soil Pb.

The selection is being made by the Department of Vegetable Crops at the Faculty of Agriculture in Zagreb and the project has been co-financed by the town of Ogulin. The Ogulin cabbage has become the most famous product in the area due to its high quality. The cabbage producers supported the idea to ensure the protection of geographical indication and designation of origin of the cabbage as a recognisable product. Requirements for the protection include proving that the product has been produced on the specific site for a number of years, which this article aims to show. It also presents the development of agriculture in this area in the last several centuries. Emphasis is given to the last sixty years, that is, the period of market production of the Ogulin cabbage.

40|$|Current digital {{soil mapping}} (DSM) methods have limitations. For instance, it is {{difficult}} to predict a large number of soil properties simultaneously, while preserving the relationships between them. Another problem is that prevalent prediction models use pedological knowledge in a very crude way only. To tackle these problems, we investigated the use of structural equation modelling (SEM). SEM {{has its roots in the}} social sciences and is recently also being used in other scientific disciplines, such as ecology. SEM integrates empirical information with mechanistic knowledge by deriving the model equations from known causal relationships, while estimating the model parameters using the available data. It distinguishes between endogenous and exogenous variables, where, in our application, the first are soil properties and the latter are external soil forming factors (i. e. climate, relief, organisms). We introduce SEM theory and present a case study in which we applied SEM to a 22, 900 km 2 region in the Argentinian Pampas to map seven key soil properties. In this case study, we started with identifying the main soil forming processes in the study area and assigned for each process the main soil properties affected. Based on this analysis we defined a conceptual soil-landscape model, which was subsequently converted to a SEM graphical model. Finally, we derived the SEM equations and implemented these in the statistical software R using the latent variable analysis (lavaan) package. The model was calibrated using a soil dataset of 320 soil profile data and 12 environmental covariate layers. The outcomes of the model were maps of seven soil properties and a SEM graph that shows the strength of the relationships. Although the accuracy of the maps, based on cross-validation and independent validation, was poor, this paper demonstrates that SEM can be used to explicitly <b>include</b> <b>pedological</b> knowledge in prediction of soil properties and modelling of their interrelationships.

The understanding of current environmental problems such as land degradation is strongly enhanced when trajectories of pastlandscape development are taken into account. In the Pare Mountains of north-eastern Tanzania widespread exposure of subsoil and saprolite indicates large-scale land degradation, which was advanced in the mid- 19 th century when the first European travellers reported widespread deforestation. The present study explores the timing, causes and consequences of past soil erosion to assess whether the spread of agriculture, large-scale iron working, or agricultural intensification during the 19 th-century caravan trade were the main drivers of present day land degradation. Geoarchaeological investigations drawing on a multi-proxy approach <b>including</b> <b>pedological</b> investigations of slope deposits and palaeoecological analysis of swamp sediments, suggest that enhanced soil erosion and corresponding accumulation of slope deposits started about 2000 years ago, roughly contemporaneous {{with the arrival of}} new subsistence strategies like agriculture and the spread of iron working. Three distinct periods of soil erosion characterised by an increasing intensity of land use have been distinguished by macroscopic soil features and analytical measurements: Slow topsoil erosion from about 300 BC on, accelerated runoff-based erosion of subsoils since the 15 th century and ongoing land degradation under intensive agricultural land use since the 19 th century. Progressive land clearance and continuous soil erosion depleted topsoil and later subsoil resources progressively, but resulted in rapid changes of environmental processes when internal thresholds were crossed. Topsoil exhaustion in the 15 th century caused a shift from slow aggregate-based to accelerated runoff-based erosion, whereas localised colluviation is identified as having dammed the Lomwe swamp in the 6 th century. This research highlights the importance of cumulative impacts of prolonged human land use, whether forest clearing or cultivation, for landscape development. Rather than abrupt climate change, the impact of slow but continuous anthropogenic degradation processes is critical when assessing longterm stability of environment systems or the sustainability of land use practices. The investigation of past soil erosion based on its corresponding terrestrial archives produces detailed, site-specific reconstructions of past environments and their dominant processes and allows conclusions about human land use practices and settlement history. This is particularly important where the archaeological record is restricted due to anthropogenic erosion of past land surfaces. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Geological, geomorphological, {{hydrological}} and <b>pedological</b> <b>features</b> {{form with}} biological elements the natural heritage, which, {{in addition to}} cultural material features (historical monuments, archaeological vestiges) or intangible elements of the culture (e. g. traditions) constitute the heritage of an area, a country or even the World. Heritage recognition {{is the result of}} a complex process including the awareness of the heritage value by specialists (e. g. scientists), by militants (e. g. environmental associations) and then by large circles of the society. The emergence of this awareness often happens in times of crisis (Di Méo, 2008) (e. g. when species are close to disappear) and is not concomitant for all parts of nature or culture. Until recently geological and geomorphological features have not been fully recognized as heritage by the society. The current context of environmental crisis (climate change, overexploitation of natural resources) seems to be one of the drivers of a process of geoheritage recognition in several parts of the World. In this process, the first stage is often the selection of objects worth to be conserved and transmitted to the future generations. This selection, carried out by geoscientists, is funded on a set of values attributed to the potential heritage objects. The definition of these values is underway in the scientific community since the 1990 s. Two main lines of research have emerged. (1) The first one reflects an anthropo-centred conception of Nature. These authors (e. g. Reynard, 2005) consider that the core value of geosites is their scientific importance for the knowledge of the Earth, climate and life history on the planet Earth; this central value (scientific) may be completed by several so-called additional values (e. g. ecological, cultural, aesthetic); they form together the intrinsic value of geosites. In this context, "intrinsic" is understood as inherent in the nature of the object as defined by the Earth sciences. In addition, several works (e. g. Giusti and Calvet, 2010) have demonstrated that this intrinsic value can completed by a second group of interests forming the social value of geosites, often defined based on their interest for education or tourism. (2) A second view exists, based on an eco-centred conception of Nature (Sharples, 2002). These works as- sign importance to geological and geomorphological objects without any reference to human interests. The assessment of the geodiversity can also be considered as an eco-centred tentative of defining the value of the "geonature" per se. A detailed comparison of various geosite assessment methods relating to the first conception shows that: (1) the main values considered are very similar even if the criteria used for the assessment and their weighting can vary from one method to the other; 2) more than the criteria to be used, it is the transparency of the procedure that is important for understanding how the sites have been selected; (3) new research is needed to evaluate what are the differences between the selection funded by the anthropo- and eco-centred assessment methods...|$|R
40|$|Archaeological {{records from}} {{excavations}} {{of the last}} forty years in the Campania region (southern Italy) attest an intense human occupation from the Early Bronze Age (EBA) to the present day. Findings of the cultural sphereof the EBA, known asfacies of Palma Campaniain the southern Italy, have beenwidelyburied by the pyroclastic deposits of the Vesuvius Pomici diAvellino eruption (3945 yrcalBP). Because of the exceptional importance and preservation of the relicsfoundin the excavation of the 1995 in Balle/Pirucchi locationat Palma Campania (Naples),a detailed (micromorphological and chemical) soil study was carried out oni) avery deepsoil chronosequence (approximately 9 m), composed of soil and pyroclastic deposits dating from the Pomici di Mercato eruption (8890 yrcal BP) until the present day and ii) a wide (4500 m 2) paleo-surface belonging to the EBA. As shown by the chemical (i. e. organic matter– OM, cation exchange capacity– CEC, pH, ammonium oxalate extractable Al and Fe–Alo+ 0. 5 Feo index, organic and inorganic phosphorous fractions – OP and IOP) and physical (i. e. particle size distribution - PSD) properties, allsoils of the sequence i) formed by weathering of volcanic materials,ii) satisfy the requirements for Andosolclassification,iii) are markedly different in terms ofdepth, degree of andic properties and chemical fertility, iv) show micromorphological features (e. g. clay and silty coatings, laminar features, iron segregations, weathering rims,ecc.) indicatingspecific weathering environments. Moreover, the comparison of selected soil properties, such as Alo+ 0. 5 Feo index(essential for Andosols) and OM,andthe estimated pedogenetic times (EPT), calculated {{on the basis of the}} volcanological markers,withthe climatic conditions by the literature,highlights a markedrelationship between the degree of development of those properties (i. e. their content) in the soils of Palma Campania and the humidity/aridity of the environment. These resultsencourage furtherapplications aimed to use these soil propertiesas proxy for the reconstruction of past climatic conditions in volcanic environments. The soil properties measured in the different areas of the EBA paleo-surface showed very consistent with both archaeological findings and reconstructed agricultural uses. Indeed, the very high OP content, along with the enrichment of OMin the soils of the North and Central sectors are in accordance with the pasture and agricultural activities, respectively,suggested by the numerous chaotically scattered animal track sand the parallel furrows of “strip” cultivation, while both OP and OM are markedly lower in the coetaneous soil analyzed along the soil chronosequence, where no anthropic or animal traces were found. Regarding to the controversial interpretation about the use of the South area, peculiar <b>pedological</b> <b>features</b> and chemical properties strongly suggest the anthropic genesis for the ancient micro-topography. Indeed, the presence of a broken soil structure, horizontal planar pores and vertical orientated laminar aggregates in a massive structure reveal a process of deeply mixing and strongly compacting soil horizons to form micro-relieves and micro-concavities. High O Pand OM content are found at 7 - 25 cm below the soil surface, probably as a consequence of manuring and ploughing. Further abandonment and waterlogging of the area are consistent with the presence of Phragmites footprints,previously found during the archaeological survey, and absence of a specific shape of ploughing traces...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out in the Volturno River’s lower basin (Campania, south Italy), an area of {{significant}} agronomic, economic, and cultural value but which is characterised by extensive environmental concerns. The area {{is a part of the}} “Litorale Domizio-Flegreo e Agro Aversano” Site of Regional Interest (SRI), due to the presence of several “potentially polluted” sites and illegal landfills, some containing toxic/harmful pellet foundry slag. Taking into account the relevance of potential environmental risks, linked to dangerous waste dispersion, and their serious socio-economic implications, research began with the general aim to assess whether or not the pollution hazard really had jeopardised the agricultural soils of Volturno River’s lower basin. Specifically, this study was concerned with the distribution and concentration of selected potentially toxic elements (Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn), in soil samples and representative profiles, with reference to different <b>pedological</b> <b>features</b> and physical–chemical characteristics. The main aim was to clarify the natural and anthropic factors influencing their occurrence. Hence, a detailed survey {{was carried out}} by collecting 64 core samples at fixed depths (0 – 20, 20 – 40 cm) and examining seven different soil profiles through the identification of 39 genetic horizons. Univariate and multivariate statistics were used for the interpretation of the data sets. As consequence of the intrinsic heterogeneity of the investigated Pedons, which are influenced by the variable flooding regime, PTEs distribution usually fails to show a sharp, linear concentration gradient with depth. On the opposite, evident fluctuations along profiles were systematically observed. For those concerned core drill samples, the raw data sets (median ± 2 MAD) for Cu (12. 93 – 48. 33 mg kg − 1), Pb (1. 70 – 50. 10 mg kg − 1), and Zn (32. 13 – 129. 13 mg kg − 1) appear to conform to the background population. On the opposite, an element specific situation appears to exist for Cd (0. 01 – 11. 89 mg kg − 1) characterised by values exceeding the geogenic background concentration (0. 43 mg kg − 1) as well as the threshold values (2 mg kg − 1) ruled by the Italian legislation. However, according to current laws, the investigated area cannot be defined as “contaminated site” sensu strictu, since some anomalous PTEs concentration is erratic and inconsistent with others. Principal factor analysis (PFA) shows that soil organic matter (SOM) is the most important sink for the investigated PTEs, suggesting that their occurrence and distribution have a mainly pedogenic control. From this point of view, SOM acts as a sink of PTE by secondary accumulation processes, most probably favoured by the formation of organo-metal complexes. This suggests that PTEs linked to SOM can substantially arise from the weathering of the geogenic PTE forms, as well as unintentional or illegal “anthropogenic” factors may influence the whole soil PTEs pool. Indeed, such findings do not exclude that some PTE accumulation in the investigated soils may also have been due to anthropogenic sources. As a matter of fact, given the long-standing human impact on the investigated area, an anthropogenic influence on PTE background concentrations cannot be a priori excluded. From this point of view, the agricultural soils of Volturno River’s lower basin require strict control and protection from the illegal deposition of waste materials, in order to prevent the widespread diffusion of pollution. </br...|$|R

40|$|Spatio-temporal {{variability}} {{of the fire}} regime in the Kruger National Park (KNP) has been analyzed for the 1957 - 2011 period.

This analysis supports the hypothesis that the spatial pattern of fire regime is strongly influenced by the environmental template defined by climatic, geological, <b>pedological</b> and vegetation <b>features.</b> Moreover, contrary to some previous studies, together with the precipitation trend, fire management changes had a significant role in determining the temporal variability of the fire regime at the scale of KNP, particularly regarding the burnt area and the fire frequency. The complex interaction between the environmental template and management in determining the variability of the fire regime, as underscored by our study, defends the merit of adopting an adaptive planning/management based approach supported by quantitative analytic tools.

40|$|La sucesión sedimentaria de Gorina (Pleistoceno medio-tardío y Holoceno) está compuesta por depósitos eólicos (loess) modificados por pedogénesis en grado variable. Sobre la base de rasgos macromorfológicos (escala de campo) se reconocieron 5 unidades pedológicas (informalmente denominadas de arriba hacia abajo, Pu 1, [...] Pu 5). Sus composiciones granulométricas comprenden facies texturales fangosas (Pu 1, Pu 2, Pu 3), limosas (Pu 1, Pu 2, Pu 3) y limo arenosas (Pu 4, Pu 5), en casi todos los casos, con distribuciones unimodales. Las relaciones entre componentes gruesos y finos para los límites de 31 &# 956;m y 15 &# 956;m (g/f 31 &# 956;m y g/f 15 &# 956;m) indican una disminución del tamaño medio de partículas desde la parte {{superior}} de Pu 4 hasta el techo de la sucesión. La composición mineralógica de la fracción arena muy fina señala aportes litológicos heterogéneos procedentes de rocas metamórficas (asociación de cuarzo deformado, feldespato deformado, cuarzo microcristalino y granate), rocas graníticas (microclino, micas, cuarzo) y rocas volcánicas o volcaniclásticas basálticas (líticos volcánicos, anfíboles y piroxenos). La presencia escasa de vidrio volcánico fresco, excepto en dos niveles, procede de aportes piroclásticos distales (lluvia de ceniza). En la fracción arcilla se reconocieron illita, esmectita, caolinita, así como interestratificados illita-esmectita. La sucesión es el producto de la acreción de polvo eólico grueso a fino sobre una superficie topográfica con permanente formación de suelos que reorganizaba los materiales depositados sinsedimentariamente. Durante el proceso de sedimentación se registraron dos hiatus depositacionales significativos, representados por Pu 5 y Pu 1, y dos episodios erosivos que truncaron las superficies de Pu 5 y Pu 2. Durante el intervalo representado por Pu 4, Pu 3 y Pu 2, hubo relativa continuidad tanto en el proceso de acumulación como en la formación de suelos. The Gorina locality {{is representative}} of the Quaternary sedimentary record of the northeastern Pampas of Buenos Aires province. The main goals of this contribution are to analyze the composition (grain-size and mineralogy) of the deposits and discuss their nature and provenance. The general balance and interaction of the sedimentation process with pedogenesis and erosion are also evaluated. The studied section (middle to late Pleistocene and Holocene) is a quarry exposure about 11 meters thick. It was sampled at approximately 25 cm intervals for grain size, mineralogical and micromorphological analyses. The micromorphological results are fully discussed in a separate contribution (Zárate et al., 2000). <b>Pedological</b> <b>features</b> are common throughout the succession. Thus, a combined macromorphological and micromorphological approach was used to identify and differentiate paleosols. Five pedological units (from top to bottom Pu 1, Pu 2, Pu 3, Pu 4, Pu 5), apparently representing four discrete paleosols plus the surface soil, were initially differentiated on the basis of field-scale morphological properties (i. e., color, texture, structure, consistency, boundaries) following the approach applied by other authors in the region. Micromorphologically, the presence of excremental fabrics throughout the vertical column suggests that bioturbation processes were active as the sediment accreted with buildup of the surface resulting in conversion of A into B and C horizons (Zárate et al., 2000). The micromorphological data do not support the field differentiation of Pu 4, Pu 3, and Pu 2. <b>Pedological</b> <b>features</b> (e. g. excrements, secondary carbonate coatings, illuvial clay coatings) occur throughout without any obvious breaks or patterns that might warrant the separation into discrete paleosols. This ca. 8 m sequence is interpreted as an accretionary and/or welded pedocomplex with superimposition of secondary carbonate on illuvial clay features and illuvial clay coatings on excrements as the surface built up and horizons became transformed (Zárate et al., submitted). According to their grain size composition, the lower two units (Pu 5, Pu 4) are composed of sandy silt textural facies, whilst the upper three units (Pu 3, Pu 2, Pu 1) have mud and silt textural facies (Folk, 1954). The coarse/fine ratios (g/f 31 &# 956;m and g/f 15 &# 956;m) indicate a progressive grain size decrease from the lower part of Pu 4 upwards with dominance of finetextured sediments in the upper three units (Pu 3, Pu 2, Pu 1). The muds are unimodal (modes at coarse and medium silt) consisting of up to 30 - 50 % fine clay and colloidal clay. The silty textural facies are characterized by a non-prominent mode (coarse silt fraction) including up to 20 % of fine clay and colloidal clay. The sandy silt facies are unimodal and can be divided into coarse sandy silts (mode at the very fine sand fraction) and fine sandy silts (mode at the coarse silt fraction). The mineralogical composition of the very fine to coarse sand fractions consists of both deformed quartz and feldspar, microcrystalline quartz and garnet derived from metamorphic rocks; microcline, micas and quartz from granitic rocks along with volcanic lithics and pyroxenes from basaltic extrusive and intrusive rocks. Rare fresh volcanic shards occur throughout the succession, apart from in the lower parts of Pu 4 and Pu 1 where they are dominant and are probably related to volcanic ash falls. The clay fraction is composed of illite, smectite, kaolinite and interstratified illite-smectite. The illite, dominant at Pu 1, Pu 4 and Pu 5; smectite-interstratified illite-smectite, predominant in Pu 2; kaolinite very rare, though relatively constant in every unit. In Pu 3, the abundance of illite and smectite-interstratified illite-smectite are comparable. Both illite and smectite display low crystallinity, particularly in the lower units (Pu 3, Pu 4, Pu 5). The sedimentation of the parent material of Pu 5 was related to a supply of eolian dust, characteristic of a typical loess (mean grain size: medium silt). Sandy loess (mean grain size: coarse silt) accumulated during the deposition of the lower part of Pu 4, changing gradually to finer textured loess upwards (typical loess-clayey loess). The upper horizon (Ab) of Pu 4 coincides with the transition between the lower coarser and the upper finer textures of the succession. The Pu 2 and Pu 3 sedimentary interval appears to represent a relatively continuous sedimentation process with no significant changes in the sedimentary supply corresponding to a fine eolian dust (mean grain size: fine to very fine silt). The accumulation of this fine eolian dust (clayey loess) was also dominant during the time interval recorded by Pu 1. At some levels of the succession, aqueous transport (hillslope wash?) played a secondary role in the reworking of the sediments. The dominant granitic and metamorphic mineralogical composition of the very fine sand fraction suggests a source area related to crystalline basement rocks which might correspond to the Precambrian bedrock of Uruguay, the Paraná Basin and/or Sierras Pampeanas of Córdoba and San Luis. Volcanic ash falls from distant Andean sources played a secondary role except at two stratigraphic levels. The origin of the clay minerals could not be established, though other authors have related them to either neoformation or direct derivation from source areas. The Quaternary sedimentary succession of Gorina resulted from the accretion of coarse to fine eolian dust. Pedogenesis was simultaneous with the sedimentary process throughout the succession with two significant depositional hiatus recorded by Pu 5 and Pu 1 and two erosional episodes that stripped away the surfaces of both Pu 5 and Pu 2. The interval represented by Pu 2, Pu 3 and Pu 4 might reflect relatively continuous sedimentation. Alternatively, welding of pedological profiles may have masked any evidence for major depositional hiatuses...|$|R
40|$|Ignorance {{about the}} pattern of ancient land use within prehistoric and medieval fields on Dartmoor and {{elsewhere}} provided the catalyst for the research reported in this thesis, which explores new ways of assessing past land use in abandoned enclosures. The first chapter provides a brief, critical evaluation of relevant earlier archaeological research; the limitations of current procedures, which reveal little about pastoral land use, are discussed and it is concluded that, {{although there have been}} few scientifically rigorous studies of the soils in ancient settlements and fields, soil analysis accompanied by explicit modelling of the interaction of agricultural land use and soils could provide new information about past land use, but only within a framework of research that defines the natural trajectories of soil development as a prerequisite to the isolation of 'land use—deflected' pedogenesis. In Chapter 2, a review of some of the principal features of moorland soils is followed by an assessment {{of the ways in which}} they may have been modified by recent, 'extensive' land use. Information provided by pedological and agricultural research is then used to formulate models of changes in the physical and chemical properties of soil that might be expected to occur as a result of various forms of 'intensive' agricultural land use; particular attention is paid to {{the pattern of}} phosphorus redistribution in pastoral enclosures. An environmental and cultural history of Holne Moor on Dartmoor is presented in Chapter 3, and it is shown that this area possesses archaeological and <b>pedological</b> <b>features</b> that make it eminently suitable as a study area within which to test ideas and predictions about the way in which early land use may have modified soil properties; the chapter concludes with an account of the fieldwork and laboratory strategies that have been used to investigate the soils within this study area. The results of a field survey of the soils and vegetation on Holne Moor are described and interpreted in Chapter 4; it is concluded that many of the properties of the surface soils reflect a combination of features acquired during medieval farming and during subsequent pedogenetic reversion. The pattern of soil properties is shown to be consistent with a pattern of land use that can be inferred from archaeological investigations of the medieval enclosures themselves and provides additional information about land use within the enclosures and the sequence of land abandonment. Qunntitative investigations of soil phosphorus and organic matter are reported and analysed in Chapter 5. Palaeosol studies provide evidence of the general course of pedogenesis and also allow the conclusion that significant changes in soil phosphorus have occurred since prehistoric times and even over the past thousand years. Analyses of soils in prehistoric houses and monuments, and in the fields of nearby, modern farms are then used to establish a picture of the way in which the soils of the study area have responded to phosphorus inputs and agricultural management. Conclusions reached as a result of these studies, together with the models offered in Chapter 2 1 form the basis for interpretation of investigations of the soils within medieval and prehistoric agricultural enclosures; these are described in the concluding sections of the chapter, where it is shown that patterns consistent with the models can be identified within these ancient enclosures. Some of the more important conclusions arising from this research are set out in Chapter 6; the primary conclusions are that very detailed information about medieval land use can be, and has been obtained through intensive field survey alone, and that analysis of soil phosphorus can provide important, new information about the agricultural use of both medieval and prehistoric enclosures...|$|R
40|$|The Great Konya Basin is in {{the south}} of the Central Anatolian Plateau in Turkey. It is a {{depression}} without outlet to the sea. The central part of the Basin is the floor of a former Pleistocene lake, the Ancient Konya Lake. This area, called the LacustrinePlain, has highly calcareous clayey sediments and is flat and level, except for ancient shorelines which form sandy ridges and beaches. Its soils have been studied in the summers of 1964 - 8 as part of the Konya Project, a research and training programme of the Department of Tropical Soil Science of the Agricultural University, Wageningen. This book is the last publication about the results in a series of five. The Quarternary history of the Lacustrine Plain, as regards sedimentation, was reconstructed with the help of existing climatic chronologies and with observations on geomorphology, soils, shells and pollen. Presumably Ancient Konya Lake, which had a constant level of about 1017 m, dried up in Postpluvial I (about 16. 000 BC) and four smaller lakes or marshes existed in secondary depressions during Sub-pluvial I (about 9000 BC) which gradually disappeared. Their level varied between 1000 and 1006 m. The soils of the Lacustrine Plain were mostly formed in white uniform carbonatic clay, but differ markedly in composition and morphology because of past and present differences in hydrology, topography and vegetation. The soils have been studied and mapped on a regional basis and divided into Steppe Marl Soils, Marsh Marl Soils and Playa Marl Soils. The last group occurs north and east of Karapinar and is strongly salt- affected. Profile data of some 13 representative Marl Soil profiles are presented in the form of structural diagrams and tables for easy reference. Soil peels (preserved natural soil profiles) of the same representative soils are also used for a precise description of the <b>pedological</b> <b>features</b> and voids of the soil material, using Brewer's system of 'pedography'. Areas for more expensive thin sections could be selected more carefully. Interpretation is based on the descriptions in the field, in the soil peel and occasionally in thin section. Organisms, presumably mainly earthworms, seemed the main cause of the present structure of the solum. The effects of recent cultivation and irrigation are also demonstrated. Redistribution of carbonates humus and iron is observed and explained. The textural and mineralogical composition of Marl Soils was studied superficially. The soil texture without removal of carbonates is mostly clay to silty-clay and is slightly finer- textured after carbonates have been removed. The carbonates (mainly calcium carbonate as calcite) occupy about an equal proportion of the clay, silt and sand fractions. Clay minerals of the smectite group are commonest and palygorskite is present. The carbonatic clayey parent material of the Marl Soil is a sediment of about 60 % mainly chemically precipitated calcite, debris from limestone and shells and the rest is a residue of non-calcareous clay minerals of residual and alluvial origin and sand sized mineral grains of alluvial or aeolian origin. The productivity of Steppe Marl Soils is estimated, using results from the soil peels and data on moisture and soil fertility. The suitability for agriculture is estimated by an existing procedure, which was refined and adapted to the area. The procedure compares estimated deficiencies in soil structure, soil moisture and chemical soil fertility in comparison with ideal conditions. The feasibility for improvement is then assessed for three management systems: dry farming without fertilizers, dry far ing with fertilizers and irrigated farming with fertilizers. The soil suitability in 4 classes (good, fair, restricted and unsuitable) is assessed {{on the basis of the}} above analysis. The suitability of Steppe Marl Soils for agriculture is judged as 'unsuitable' or 'restricted' under the dry-farming systems, mainly because of lack of moisture and 'restricted' under irrigation (mainly because of poor irrigability and poor response to fertilizers). It may become 'fair' under highly sophisticated irrigational management as is demonstrated on comparable soils in Israel and Florida...|$|R
