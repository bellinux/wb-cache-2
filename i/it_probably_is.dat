500|$|Soon {{after it}} became a {{tropical}} storm on 9 October near Madeira, with a ragged eye already present, the NHC officially named it Tropical Storm Vince and began to issue advisories. At the time there was some uncertainty as to whether Vince was tropical or subtropical but, in his post-season analysis, forecaster James L. Franklin of the NHC conceded that Vince had formed as a subtropical storm and had evolved into a tropical storm before it was named. The storm's ragged eye quickly solidified and contracted into a [...] "bona fide" [...] eye with a diameter of 15mi (25km). This increase in organization was accompanied by strengthening, and Vince reached its peak strength as a hurricane with 75mph (120km/h) winds later that day. The NHC forecaster decided that [...] "if {{it looks like a}} hurricane, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is,</b> despite its environment and unusual location".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} also the subject of {{criticism}} for its portrayal of the September 11 attacks, in which Brian and Stewie {{go back in time}} to make the attacks happen again, ultimately resulting in a high five when they are successful (despite Stewie immediately remarking that would sound terrible out of context). The Daily Mail reported on the episode writing, [...] "Nothing is ever off limits for Family Guy and its creator Seth MacFarlane. No topic is taboo, not the Holocaust, not drunk driving and not even abortion, but last night's episode may finally have crossed the line." [...] Terri Pous [...] of Time also wrote of the episode, [...] "It sounds custom-made for a 'too soon' label, and <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is.</b> But avid Family Guy viewers live for [...] "too soon" [...] moments, no matter how sensitive the material." [...] Other news organizations, including Aly Semigran of Entertainment Weekly, also thought the show had gone too far with the reference. Nellie Andreeva of Deadline also commented that it [...] "squeaked past the Fox standards and practices department but is sure to raise as many eyebrows." [...] MacFarlane was scheduled to be on one of the planes that hit the Twin Towers but overslept allegedly due to being hungover.|$|E

2500|$|The {{husbandry}} system of water buffalo {{depends on the}} purpose {{for which they are}} bred and maintained. Most of them are kept by people who work on small farms in family units. Their buffalo live in very close association with them, and are often their greatest capital asset. The women and girls in India generally look after the milking buffalo while the men and boys are concerned with the working animals. Throughout Asia, they are commonly tended by children who are often seen leading or riding their charges to wallowing places. Water buffalo are the ideal animals for work in the deep mud of paddy fields because of their large hooves and flexible foot joints. They are often referred to as [...] "the living tractor of the East". <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> possible to plough deeper with buffalo than with either oxen or horses. They are the most efficient and economical means of cultivation of small fields. In most rice-producing countries, they are used for threshing and for transporting the sheaves during the rice harvest. They provide power for oilseed mills, sugarcane presses, and devices for raising water. They are widely used as pack animals, and in India and Pakistan also for heavy haulage. In their invasions of Europe, the Turks used buffalo for hauling heavy battering rams. Their dung is used as a fertilizer, and as a fuel when dried.|$|E

6000|$|The [...] "Washoe Zephyr" [...] (Washoe is a pet {{nickname}} for Nevada) is a peculiar Scriptural wind, in that no man knoweth [...] "whence it cometh." [...] That is to say, where it originates. It comes {{right over the}} mountains from the West, but when one crosses the ridge he does not find any {{of it on the}} other side! <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> manufactured on the mountain-top for the occasion, and starts from there. It is a pretty regular wind, in the summer time. Its office hours are from two in the afternoon till two the next morning; and anybody venturing abroad during those twelve hours needs to allow for the wind or he will bring up a mile or two to leeward of the point he is aiming at. And yet the first complaint a Washoe visitor to San Francisco makes, is that the sea winds blow so, there! There is a good deal of human nature in that.|$|E

60|$|All {{round the}} kingdom the men are, as a rule, eager to man our lifeboats. Usually {{there is a}} rush to the work; and as the men get only ten shillings per man in the daytime, and twenty shillings at night, on each {{occasion}} of going off, it can scarcely be supposed that they do it only {{for the sake of}} the pay! True, those payments are increased on occasions of unusual risk or exposure; nevertheless, I believe that a worthier motive animates our men of the coast. I do not say, or think, that religious feeling is the cause of their heroism. With some, doubtless, it is; with others <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> not; but I sincerely believe that the Word of God--permeating as it does our whole community, and influencing these men either directly or indirectly--is the cause of their self-sacrificing courage, as it is unquestionably the cause of our national prosperity.|$|E
60|$|Inheritance at Corresponding Seasons of the Year.—With {{animals in}} a state of nature innumerable {{instances}} occur of characters periodically appearing at different seasons. We see this with the horns of the stag, and with the fur of arctic animals which becomes thick and white during the winter. Numerous birds acquire bright colours and other decorations during the breeding-season alone. I can throw but little light on this form of inheritance from facts observed under domestication. Pallas states,[356] that in Siberia domestic cattle and horses periodically become lighter-coloured during the winter; and I have observed a similar marked change of colour in certain ponies in England. Although I do not know that this tendency to assume a differently coloured coat during different seasons of the year is transmitted, yet <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> so, as all shades of colour are strongly inherited by the horse. Nor is this form of inheritance, as limited by season, more remarkable than inheritance as limited by age or sex.|$|E
60|$|And {{if there}} is one thing more than another likely to make a man feel ridiculous it is {{standing}} on tip-toe in a corner, holding a machine to his head, and listening intently to nothing. Your back aches and your head aches, your very hair aches. You hear the door open behind you and somebody enter the room. You can't turn your head. You swear at them, and hear the door close with a bang. It immediately occurs to you that in all probability it was Henrietta. She promised to call for you at half-past twelve: you were to take her to lunch. It was twelve o'clock when you were fool enough to mix yourself up with this infernal machine, and <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> half-past twelve by now. Your past life rises before you, accompanied by dim memories of your grandmother. You are wondering how much longer you can bear the strain of this attitude, and whether after all you do really want to see the man in the next street but two, when the girl in the exchange-room calls up to know if you're done.|$|E

60|$|With {{animals in}} a state of nature, innumerable {{instances}} occur of characters appearing periodically at different seasons. We see this in the horns of the stag, and in the fur of Artic animals which becomes thick and white during the winter. Many birds acquire bright colours and other decorations during the breeding-season alone. Pallas states (35. 'Novae species Quadrupedum e Glirium ordine,' 1778, p. 7. On the transmission of colour by the horse, see 'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,' vol. i. p. 51. Also vol. ii. p. 71, for a general discussion on 'Inheritance as limited by Sex.'), that in Siberia domestic cattle and horses become lighter-coloured during the winter; and I have myself observed, and heard of similar strongly marked changes of colour, that is, from brownish cream-colour or reddish-brown to a perfect white, in several ponies in England. Although I do not know that this tendency to change the colour of the coat during different seasons is transmitted, yet <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> so, as all shades of colour are strongly inherited by the horse. Nor is this form of inheritance, as limited by the seasons, more remarkable than its limitation by age or sex.|$|E
60|$|The squire had {{determined}} to be very indignant,--very indignant even with the Secretary of State himself, to whose indifference he attributed the delay which had occurred;--but almost more than indignant when he {{found that he was}} to be fobbed off with Mr. Brown. But there was something in the gentleman's voice which checked his indignation. There was something in Mr. Brown's eye, a mixture of good-humour and authority, which made him feel that he ought not to be angry with the gentleman till he was quite sure of the occasion. Mr. Brown was a handsome hale old man with grey whiskers and greyish hair, with a well-formed nose and a broad forehead, carefully dressed with a light waistcoat and a checked linen cravat, wearing a dark-blue frockcoat, and very well made boots,--an old man, certainly, but who looked as though old age must naturally be the happiest time of life. When a man's digestion is thoroughly good and his pockets adequately filled, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> so. Such were the circumstances of Mr. Brown, who, as the squire looked at him, seemed to partake more of the nature of his nephew and brothers-in-law than of the Browns generally.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR FATHER,--Allow me to say, in a {{strictly}} Pickwickian sense, {{that you are}} a silly fellow. I am pained indeed, but how should I be offended? I think you exaggerate; I cannot forget that you had the same impression of the Deacon; and yet, when you saw it played, were less revolted than you looked for; and I will still hope that the Admiral also is not so bad as you suppose. There is one point, however, where I differ from you very frankly. Religion is in the world; I do not think you are the man to deny the importance of its rôle; and I have long decided not to leave it on one side in art. The opposition of the Admiral and Mr. Pew is not, to my eyes, either horrible or irreverent; but it may be, and <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is,</b> very ill done: what then? This is a failure; better luck next time; more power to the elbow, more discretion, more wisdom in the design, and the old defeat becomes the scene of the new victory. Concern yourself about no failure; they do not cost lives as in engineering; they are the pierres perdues of successes. Fame is (truly) a vapour; do not think of it; if the writer means well and tries hard, no failure will injure him, whether with God or man.|$|E

6000|$|The various {{ornaments}} {{possessed by}} the males are certainly of the highest importance to them, for they have been acquired in some cases {{at the expense of}} greatly impeded powers of flight or of running. The African nightjar (Cosmetornis), which during the pairing-season has one of its primary wing-feathers developed into a streamer of extreme length, is thus much retarded in its flight, although at other times remarkable for its swiftness. The “unwieldy size” of the secondary wing-feathers of the male Argus pheasant are said “almost entirely to deprive the bird of flight.” The fine plumes of male Birds of Paradise trouble them during a high wind. The extremely long tail-feathers of the male widow-birds (Vidua) of Southern Africa render “their flight heavy;” but as soon as these are cast off they fly as well as the females. As birds always breed when food is abundant, the males probably do not suffer much inconvenience in searching for food from their impeded powers of movement; but there can hardly be a doubt that they must be much more liable to be struck down by birds of prey. Nor can we doubt that the long train of the peacock and the long tail and wing-feathers of the Argus pheasant must render them a more easy prey to any prowling tiger-cat than would otherwise be the case. Even the bright colours of many male birds cannot fail to make them conspicuous to their enemies of all kinds. Hence <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is,</b> as Mr. Gould has remarked, that such birds are generally of a shy disposition, as if conscious that their beauty was a source of danger, and are much more difficult to discover or approach, than the sombre-coloured and comparatively tame females, or than the young and as yet unadorned males.[146] ...|$|E
6000|$|The army of France {{obtained}} so high a reputation, {{during the}} wars of the revolution and the empire, that you may feel some curiosity to know its actual condition. As the Bourbons understand {{that they have been}} restored to the throne, by the great powers of Europe, if not in opposition to the wishes of a majority of Frenchmen, certainly in opposition to the wishes of the active portion of the population, and consequently to that part of the nation which would be most likely to oppose their interests, they have been accused of endeavouring to keep the establishments of France so low as to put her at the mercy of any new combination of the allies. I should think this accusation, in a great degree, certainly unmerited; for France, at this moment, has a large and, so far as I can judge, a well-appointed army, and one that is charged by the liberal party with being a heavy expense to the nation, and that, too, chiefly with the intention of keeping the people in subjection to tyranny. But these contradictions are common in party politics. It is not easy here to get at statistical facts accurately, especially those which are connected with expenditure. Nominally, the army is about 200,000 men, but it is whispered that numerous congés are given, in order to divert the funds that are thus saved to other objects. Admitting all this to be true, and <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> so in part, I should think France must have fully 150,000 men embodied, without including the National Guards. Paris is pretty well garrisoned, and the casernes {{in the vicinity of the}} capital are always occupied. It appears to me there cannot be less than 20,000 men within a day's march of the Tuileries, and there may be half as many more.[8] ...|$|E
60|$|Under a {{practical}} point of view, agriculturists and horticulturists may {{learn something from}} the conclusions at which we have arrived. Firstly, {{we see that the}} injury from the close breeding of animals and from the self-fertilisation of plants, does not necessarily depend on any tendency to disease or weakness of constitution common to the related parents, and only indirectly on their relationship, in so far as they are apt to resemble each other in all respects, including their sexual nature. And, secondly, that the advantages of cross-fertilisation depend on the sexual elements of the parents having become in some degree differentiated by the exposure of their progenitors to different conditions, or from their having intercrossed with individuals thus exposed, or, lastly, from what we call in our ignorance spontaneous variation. He therefore who wishes to pair closely related animals ought to keep them under conditions as different as possible. Some few breeders, guided by their keen powers of observation, have acted on this principle, and have kept stocks of the same animals at two or more distant and differently situated farms. They have then coupled the individuals from these farms with excellent results. (12/17. 'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication' chapter 17 2nd edition volume 2 pages 98, 105.) This same plan is also unconsciously followed whenever the males, reared in one place, are let out for propagation to breeders in other places. As some kinds of plants suffer much more from self-fertilisation than do others, so <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> with animals from too close interbreeding. The effects of close interbreeding on animals, judging again from plants, would be deterioration in general vigour, including fertility, with no necessary loss of excellence of form; and this seems to be the usual result.|$|E
