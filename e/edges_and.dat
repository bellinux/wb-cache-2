The Dudley Boyz started the match as the champions, <b>and</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian won the title. The Hardyz faced <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian {{for the title}} at Insurrextion and {{defeated}} them by disqualification, which meant that <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian retained the title. At King of the Ring, the Hardy Boyz squared off in a Four Corners Elimination match for the Tag Team Championship which included the champions Too Cool (Grandmaster Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty), T & A (Test <b>and</b> Albert), <b>and</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian. The Hardyz were able to eliminate T & A before getting eliminated themselves by <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian.|$|R

5|$|The {{yellowhammer}} is a bird of dry open country, preferably with a {{range of}} vegetation types and some trees from which to sing. It is absent from urban areas, forests and wetlands. Probably originally found at forest <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> large clearing, it has benefited from traditional agriculture, which created extensive open areas with hedges and clumps of trees.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} Senate Select Committee {{oversaw the}} NCDC and renowned British architect Sir William Holford {{was brought in}} to fine-tune Griffin's original plans. He changed the central basin's geometry so that it was no longer a segment of circle; he converted the southern straight edge into a polygonal shape with three <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> inserted a gulf on the northern shore. The result was closer to Scrivener's modified design some decades earlier.|$|E

5000|$|As <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian complained, it was {{declared}} that <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian's title victory {{the previous night}} was official. At the same time, because the Hardy Boyz had just defeated the champions, commissioner Mick Foley ruled they were now the tag team champions. After being outsmarted by the Hardy Boyz, <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian gave up the golden costumes of Los Conquistadors. In line with the stipulations of the prior ladder match, the ban on <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian challenging for the championships had ended when [...] "Los Conquistadors" [...] defeated the Hardy Boyz' for the titles, so <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian could wrestle for the titles again without disguises.|$|R
30|$|For each {{individual}} vertex, <b>edge,</b> <b>and</b> subgraph, we place an {{upper bound on}} the size of the maximum clique possible.

5|$|Based on {{external}} appearance, Plectania nannfeldtii {{is similar to}} Pseudoplectania vogesiaca. Although this latter species {{may be difficult to}} distinguish by its less hairy external fruit body surface, its microscopic characters identify it more definitively: P.vogesiaca has spores that are much smaller, typically with widths of 12–14µm. Helvella corium is another black cup fungus that appears in the spring; it has smaller spores, whitish margins on the cup <b>edges,</b> <b>and</b> shorter stems than P.nannfeldtii. Pseudoplectania nigrella is smaller, with a hairier outer surface, a darker inner cup surface, and a rudimentary stem.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics often vary by habitat, between shade-dwelling genera (such as Prosartes, Tricyrtis, Cardiocrinum, Clintonia, Medeola, Prosartes, and Scoliopus) and sun loving genera. Shade-dwelling genera {{usually have}} broader leaves with smooth <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> net venation, and fleshy fruits (berries) with animal-dispersed seeds, rhizomes, and small, {{inconspicuous}} flowers while genera native to sunny habitats usually have narrow, parallel-veined leaves, capsular fruits with wind-dispersed seeds, bulbs, and large, visually conspicuous flowers. (See also Evolution).|$|E
5|$|Diamonds occur {{most often}} as {{euhedral}} or rounded octahedra and twinned octahedra known as macles. As diamond's crystal structure has a cubic {{arrangement of the}} atoms, they have many facets that belong to a cube, octahedron, rhombicosidodecahedron, tetrakis hexahedron or disdyakis dodecahedron. The crystals can have rounded off and unexpressive <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> can be elongated. Diamonds (especially those with rounded crystal faces) are commonly found coated in nyf, an opaque gum-like skin.|$|E

50|$|In {{the year}} 2000, the Hardy Boyz <b>and</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian {{engaged in a}} lengthy feud, with The Hardy Boyz {{capturing}} the WWF Tag Team Championship from <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian in a steel cage match at Unforgiven. The following day the Hardys won a ladder match that included a stipulation barring <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian from receiving another title shot {{for the duration of}} the Hardy Boyz' championship reign.|$|R
5|$|Eglin steel uses a {{combination}} of over a dozen different elements in varying amounts to create a relatively low-cost steel for use in bunker buster weapons. Hadfield steel (after Sir Robert Hadfield) or manganese steel contains 12–14% manganese which when abraded strain-hardens to form an incredibly hard skin which resists wearing. Examples include tank tracks, bulldozer blade <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> cutting blades on the jaws of life.|$|E
5|$|Forming a minor of a pseudoforest by {{contracting}} {{some of its}} <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> deleting others produces another pseudoforest. Therefore, {{the family}} of pseudoforests is closed under minors, and the Robertson–Seymour theorem implies that pseudoforests can be characterized {{in terms of a}} finite set of forbidden minors, analogously to Wagner's theorem characterizing the planar graphs as the graphs having neither the complete graph K5 nor the complete bipartite graph K3,3 as minors.|$|E
5|$|In the {{weighted}} maximum clique problem, the input is an undirected graph with weights on its vertices (or, less frequently, <b>edges)</b> <b>and</b> the output is a clique with maximum total weight. The maximum clique {{problem is the}} special case in which all weights are equal. As well as the problem of optimizing the sum of weights, other more complicated bicriterion optimization problems have also been studied.|$|E

The next month at WrestleMania X-Seven, the Hardy Boyz competed in another TLC match against <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian and the Dudley Boyz. Just as in the first TLC match, <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian were victorious thanks to help from Rhyno.|$|R

5|$|Shepherd {{satellites}} {{are small}} moons that orbit within, or just beyond, a planet's ring system. They {{have the effect}} of sculpting the rings: giving them sharp <b>edges,</b> <b>and</b> creating gaps between them. Saturn's shepherd moons are Pan (Encke gap), Daphnis (Keeler gap), Atlas (A Ring), Prometheus (F Ring) and Pandora (F Ring). These moons together with co-orbitals (see below) probably formed as a result of accretion of the friable ring material on preexisting denser cores. The cores with sizes from one-third to one-half the present day moons may be themselves collisional shards formed when a parental satellite of the rings disintegrated.|$|E
5|$|The Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus) is {{a common}} species of wren that is a {{resident}} in {{the eastern half of}} the United States of America, the extreme south of Ontario, Canada, and the extreme northeast of Mexico. Severe winters restrict the northern limits of their range while favorable weather conditions lead to a northward extension of their breeding range. Their preferred habitat is in dense cover in forests, farm <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> suburban areas. This wren is the state bird of South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{the creek}} whaler is {{spindle-shaped}} and rather stocky. The long snout has a narrowly parabolic shape and large nostrils preceded by small, nipple-shaped flaps of skin. The eyes are circular and of medium size, and are equipped with nictitating membranes. The arched mouth has very short furrows at the corners. There are 30 upper and 28–30 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth are long and triangular with strongly serrated <b>edges,</b> <b>and</b> become increasing angled towards {{the sides of the}} jaw. The lower teeth are slender and upright with finely serrated edges. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E

50|$|At No Mercy, the Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff Hardy) {{defeated}} <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian in a Ladder match, {{which was}} the final round match in a tournament for the managerial services of Terri Runnels and a prize of $100,000. On the October 18 episode of Raw, New Brood disbanded their relationship with Gangrel's New Brood stable, turning face in the process, and formed an alliance with their former enemies, <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian. The Holly Cousins defended the WWF Tag Team Championship against the Hardy Boyz on the October 21 episode of SmackDown <b>and</b> against <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian on the October 25 episode of Raw. In the latter match, Too Cool (Grand Master Sexay and Scotty Too Hotty) interfered, costing <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian the victory. The Hardy Boyz came out to rescue <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian and the four wrestlers cleared the ring of Too Cool and Hollys. As a result, the teams of <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian and Hardy Boyz began a rivalry with Too Cool and Hollys, as the four teams battled each other in several tag team matches and standard wrestling matches, leading to a Survivor Series match at Survivor Series.|$|R
50|$|The sixth {{match was}} between New Age Outlaws (Mr. Ass and Road Dogg) {{and the team}} of <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Jim Korderas {{refereed}} the match. <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian double-teamed Road Dogg throughout the match until the Outlaws began attacking <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian together. Christian hit Mr. Ass with an Unprettier. Road Dogg attempted to hit Christian with a pumphandle Slam, but Christian {{slipped out of the}} move <b>and</b> <b>Edge</b> speared Road Dogg. The New Brood (Matt and Jeff Hardy) interfered in the match, <b>and</b> started attacking <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian behind the referee's back. Mr. Ass took advantage <b>and</b> hit <b>Edge</b> with a Fameasser to win the match and as a result, New Age Outlaws retained the Tag Team Championship.|$|R
5|$|The {{filaments}} exhibit random {{orientations and}} are often wavy, which has been interpreted as evidence that they were soft and pliable in life. Microscopic examination shows that individual filaments appear dark along the <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> light internally, suggesting that they were hollow, like modern feathers. Compared to modern mammals the filaments were quite coarse, with each individual strand much larger and thicker than the corresponding hairs of similarly sized mammals.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} habitats of the Bengal slow loris range across tropical and subtropical regions, {{and include}} evergreen and semi-evergreen rainforests with forest <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> continuous, dense canopies. It {{can also be}} found in bamboo groves. It prefers habitats with larger diameter, tall trees with a large crown depth (defined as the length along the main axis from the tree tip {{to the base of the}} crown); these areas are typically associated with greater food abundance, and decreased risk of predation. Because of its preference for dense forests, it acts as a good indicator of the ecosystem's health.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{flattened}} {{in general}} shape. The front part {{is short and}} broad. The broad interorbital region (located between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped, with squared <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> weakly developed beading. A postorbital ridge is present, obscuring the suture (joint) between the frontal and squamosal bones, a feature shared only with Holochilus among oryzomyines. The braincase is squarish. The interparietal bone is wide, but does not reach the squamosals on the sides. The zygomatic arches, which are well-developed, are furthest apart at the back and converge toward the front. The jugal bone is small.|$|E
