5|$|The Yankee {{opponent}} in the 1951 World Series was the Giants, with Game 1 played the day after they won the National League pennant in the Miracle of Coogan's Bluff. On an emotional high, the Giants beat the Yankees in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium. Game 2 was a Yankee victory, but Mantle suffered a knee injury and was out for the Series, the start of knee problems that would darken Mantle's career. The Giants won Game 3, but DiMaggio stepped to the fore, with six hits in the following three games, including a home run to crown his career. The Yankees won Games 4 and 5, and staked Raschi to a 4–1 lead in Game 6 before Stengel had Johnny Sain pitch in relief. When Sain loaded the bases with none out in the ninth, Stengel brought in Bob Kuzava, a left <b>hander,</b> to pitch against the Giants, even though right handers Monte Irvin and Bobby Thomson were due to bat. The Giants scored twice, but Kuzava hung on. The Yankees and Stengel had their third straight World Series championship.|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{previous}} studies agree that inconsistent <b>handers</b> exhibit a memory advantage over consistent <b>handers,</b> oftentimes {{in reference to}} inconsistents exhibiting lower false alarm rates. Two recent studies have found contrasting data, demonstrating that, compared to consistently handed individuals, inconsistently handed individuals exhibit a higher false alarm rate in recognition memory following the encoding of pictures of objects, regardless of whether lures are pictures or object names. From this research, {{it is unclear whether}} inconsistent individuals have difficulty remembering pictures of all types, or only pictures of objects. In the current study, participants studied pictures without focal objects (i. e., landscapes and fractals), then were tested on their recognition memory for those pictures. Inconsistent <b>handers</b> exhibited higher hit rates and lower false alarm rates for fractals when compared to consistent <b>handers,</b> while inconsistent <b>handers</b> also demonstrated higher corrected recognition, regardless of picture type, in comparison to consistent <b>handers.</b> These findings suggest that inconsistent <b>handers</b> display an advantage in the recognition of abstract images, while previous research has suggested inconsistent <b>handers</b> have a disadvantage in relation to object items...|$|R

25|$|With his {{effectiveness}} {{hindered by}} {{the necessity of}} pitching two days in a row, the Browns found themselves on their heels quickly when ace Bob Caruthers walked four of the first five batters, surrendering a second run on a base hit given up to third baseman Tom Burns of the Chicagos. The game was called after completion of eight innings due to darkness. John Clarkson was again {{on top of his}} game as the right <b>hander</b> struck out 8 Browns in earning his second win of the series. Caruthers took the loss for the Browns, giving Chicago a lead of two games to one in the series.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} some modern full rollers such as Dave Ewald and Tom Smallwood. A full roller rolls the ball {{in such a way}} that the ball tracks over its full circumference, thus the name full roller. In {{addition}} to a full circumference ball track, the ball track itself crosses between the fingers and thumb through the palm in a diagonal path. A full roller release can be very straight such as Billy Hardwick rolled, or have up to a 90 degree or greater axis of rotation such as Tom Smallwood rolls. Usually a suitcase style grip with the thumb in the 9 o'clock position and the fingers in the 3 o'clock position (for a right <b>hander)</b> at the moment of release will create a full roller track. As the hand comes forward the thumb exits first, and the fingers still at 3 o'clock, lift up through the ball, causing it to rotate off the fingers to the left, creating side rotation and a horizontal track through the palm center of the ball.|$|E
40|$|Much {{debate in}} the {{handedness}} literature has centred on {{the relative merits of}} questionnaire-based measures assessing hand preference versus simple movement tasks such as peg moving or finger tapping, assessing hand performance. A third paradigm has grown in popularity, which assesses choices by participants when either hand could be used to execute movements. These newer measures may be useful in predicting possible "reversed" asymmetries in proportions of non-right handed ("adextral") people. In the current studies we examine hand choice in large samples of dextral (right handed) and adextral participants. Unlike in some previous experiments on choice, we found that left <b>handers</b> were as biased towards their dominant hand as were right <b>handers,</b> for grasping during a puzzle-making task (study 1). In a second study, participants had to point to either of two suddenly appearing targets with one hand or the other. In study 2, left <b>handers</b> were not significantly less one handed than their right-handed counterparts as in study 1. In a final study, we used random effects meta analysis to summarise the possible differences in hand choice between left <b>handers</b> and right <b>handers</b> across all hand choice studies published to date. The meta analysis suggests that right <b>handers</b> use their dominant hand 12. 5 % more than left <b>handers</b> favour their dominant hand (with 95 % confidence that the real difference lies between 7 % and 18 %). These last results suggest that our two experiments reported here may represent statistical Type 2 errors. This mean difference may be related to greater left hemispheric language and praxic laterality in right <b>handers.</b> Nevertheless, more data are needed regarding the precise proportions of left and right <b>handers</b> who favour their preferred hands for different tasks...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that right <b>handers</b> have attention biased toward their right hand during bimanual coordination (Buckingham and Carey, 2009; Peters, 1981). To determine if this behavioral asymmetry was linked to cerebral lateralization, we examined this bias in left and right <b>handers</b> by combining a discontinuous double-step reaching task with a Posner-style hand cueing paradigm. Left and right handed participants received a tactile cue (valid on 80 % of trials) prior to a bimanual reach to target pairs. Right <b>handers</b> took longer to inhibit their right hand and made more right hand errors, suggesting that their dominant hand was more readily primed to move than their non-dominant hand, likely due to the aforementioned attentional bias. Left <b>handers,</b> however, showed neither of these asymmetries, suggesting that they lack an equivalent dominant hand attentional bias. The findings are discussed in relation to recent unimanual handedness tasks in right and left <b>handers,</b> and the lateralization of systems for speech, language and motor attention...|$|R
25|$|After a new pit building, the Silverstone Wing, was {{completed}} {{in time for the}} 2011 race, the start of the track was relocated to between Club Corner and Abbey Corner. Almost flat out, the right-hander of Abbey leads immediately into the left-hander of Farm before cars brake heavily into the second gear, right-handed turn three; Village Corner. The even slower left-hander of the Loop comes immediately after, and leads into the flat-out left-hander of Aintree, before cars head down the DRS zone of the Wellington Straight; designed in 2010 to promote overtaking at the track. Turn 6, the left <b>hander</b> of Brooklands, is taken by drivers in second gear and leads immediately into Luffield, another second gear curve; a right-hand hairpin. The right-handed kink of Woodcote leads cars down the old pit straight, before the difficult sixth-gear right-hander of Copse, with a minimum speed of 175mph in the dry for Formula One cars. Then, the challenging complex of Maggotts, Becketts and Chapel - a left-right-left-right-left complex with a minimum speed of 130mph- lead cars down the 770-metre Hangar Straight with the fifth-gear right-hander of Stowe at the end. The fifteenth turn of the track, Stowe, has a minimum speed of 125mph and precedes a short straight, named Vale, which leads cars downhill towards the Club complex. Heavy braking is required for the left-hander of turn 16, and understeer can be an issue for the next right-handers of turns 17 and 18, as cars tentatively accelerate round to the start-finish straight.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} 1916 season started, {{it became clear}} that the Dodgers were one of the better teams in the league. Robinson managed to squeeze one more year of {{productivity}} out of some older veterans such as Chief Meyers, who said of Stengel, [...] "It was Casey who kept us on our toes. He was the life of the party and just kept all us old-timers [...] pepped up all season." [...] Stengel, mostly playing right field, hit [...]279 with eight home runs, one less than the team leader in that category, Wheat. Stengel's home run off Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander, who won 33 games that year, in the second game of a doubleheader on September 30, provided the margin of victory as the Dodgers went into first place to stay, qualifying for their first World Series, against the Boston Red Sox. Despite getting two hits in a Game 1 loss at Boston, Stengel was benched for Game 2 because the Red Sox were pitching a left <b>hander,</b> Babe Ruth, and Stengel hit better against right handers. Stengel, back in the lineup for Game 3, got a hit in Brooklyn's only victory of the series. He was benched again in Game 4 against left <b>hander</b> Dutch Leonard, though he was inserted as a pinch runner, and got another hit in the Game 5 loss, finishing 4 for 11, [...]364, the best Dodger batting average of the Series.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the orientation of representational drawings of everyday, graspable objects by right- and left-handed adults. Two competing hypotheses were examined. One was an affordance-based hypothesis which predicted that the graspable position of objects would be positioned {{in the side of}} space in which they are normally interacted upon. This effect was expected to be enhanced for objects involving self-directed movements (e. g., cup, toothbrush) than object-directed movements (e. g., hammer, tennis racket). The other was a biomechanical hypothesis, which predicted left placement of graspable portion of the objects be drawn by right <b>handers</b> and right placement by left <b>handers,</b> reflecting a greater ease of executions of outward directed movements. Sixty English-speaking right <b>handers</b> and 37 left <b>handers</b> each drew a total of 20 graspable objects. An overall left placement of graspable portions of objects was found, regardless of object movement type. With one exception (jug), the left bias was greater in right <b>handers</b> in 17 of the 20 objects. The results indicate that a biomechanical account provides a better explanation of drawing direction biases than an affordance account...|$|R

40|$|Most {{people are}} right-handed, preferring {{the right hand}} for skilled as well as unskilled activities, but a notable {{proportion}} are mixed-handed, preferring to use the right hand for some actions and the left hand for others. Assuming a structural/functional correlation in the motor system we tested whether asymmetries in hand performance in consistent right and left <b>handers</b> {{as well as in}} mixed <b>handers</b> are associated with anatomical asymmetries in the motor cortex. In vivo MR morphometry was used for analyzing interhemispheric asymmetry in the depth of the central sulcus in the region of cortical hand representation of 103 healthy subjects. Subjects were tested both for hand preference and hand performance. As expected, left-right differences in hand performance differed significantly between consistent right, consistent left and mixed <b>handers</b> and were independent on gender. Male consistent right <b>handers</b> showed a significant deeper central sulcus on the left hemisphere than on the right. Anatomical asymmetries decreased significantly from male consistent right over mixed to consistent left <b>handers.</b> Sixty two per cent of consistent left <b>handers</b> revealed a deeper central sulcus on the right than on the left hemisphere, but for the group as a whole this rightward asymmetry was not significant. No interhemispheric asymmetry was found in females. Thus, anatomical asymmetry was associated with handedness only in males, but nor in females, suggesting sex differences in the cortical organization of hand movements. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|In motor tasks, {{subgroups of}} lefthanders {{have been shown}} to differ in the {{distribution}} of attention about their own bodies. The present experiment examined whether similar attentional biases also apply when processing observed bodies. Sixteen right <b>handers</b> (RHs), 22 consistent left <b>handers</b> (CLHs) and 11 relatively ambidextrous inconsistent left <b>handers</b> (ILHs) performed an own body transformation task in which they were instructed to make speeded left–right judgements about a schematic human figure. Attentional biases associated with handedness were found to extend to observed bodies: CLHs’ judgements were faster to the figure’s left side, while ILHs, like RHs, showed facilitated performance to the figure’s right side. These results demonstrate a novel embodiment effect whereby the processing of a static schematic human figure is modulated by an individual’s personal motor capabilities. This finding suggests that motor simulation may contribute to whole body perception in the absence of actual or implied actions...|$|R

40|$|Is it {{advantageous}} to be strongly lateralized? The current study investigated this question {{by examining the}} relationship between visual field asymmetries for lexical tasks and reading performance {{in a sample of}} 200 young adults. Larger visual field asymmetries were associated with better reading performance, but this relationship was obtained primarily in those with strong and consistent hand preferences. Among mixed <b>handers,</b> variation in visual field asymmetry accounted for little or no variance in reading skill. In addition, correlations between visual field asymmetry and reading performance were observed for word recognition tasks, but not for tasks requiring controlled semantic retrieval. The results are consistent with the idea that consistent and mixed <b>handers</b> may represent differing neurobehavioral populations. Because greater lateralization was associated with better reading skill only for consistent <b>handers,</b> reduced behavioral asymmetry cannot be assumed to be a risk factor for reading dysfunction in the population as a whole. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.
