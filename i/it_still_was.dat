The object element {{has been a part}} of HTML since HTML 4 was {{released}} in 1998, yet by 2005 <b>it</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> not completely supported in all web browsers. The creators of Acid2 considered object element support important because it allows for content fallback—if an object fails to load, then the browser can display alternative (generally simpler, more reliable) content in its place.|$|E
5|$|With rain {{shortly before}} the race, the start was taken behind the safety car, forcing all drivers to start the race on the full wet tyres. As Ricciardo led the field behind the safety car, Daniil Kvyat had {{to come into the}} pit lane on lap two, {{complaining}} of technical issues. He rejoined with a new steering wheel, being a lap down {{on the rest of the}} pack already. The race started in earnest on lap seven, with Ricciardo defending his lead at the restart. Kevin Magnussen made a pit stop for intermediate tyres at the end of the lap, but his teammate Jolyon Palmer proved just how slippery <b>it</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> when he crashed out just a lap later, being caught out by a wet zebra crossing and causing a virtual safety car period. More cars came into the pitlane for intermediate tyres over the following laps. On lap twelve, Kimi Räikkönen damaged his front wing on the guardrail at the Loews hairpin, resulting in his front wing getting caught under his front tyres, blocking Grosjean's way in the process. Räikkönen retired some corners later. Meanwhile, Ricciardo built a gap at the front, being ten seconds clear of Rosberg on lap 13. One lap later, Sebastian Vettel was the first of the front runners to change to intermediate tyres. Mercedes issued team orders demanding Rosberg let Hamilton past on lap 16, but the gap had by then grown to 13 seconds.|$|E

25|$|Bradstreet was not {{responsible}} for her writing becoming public. Bradstreet's brother-in-law, John Woodbridge, sent her work off to be published. Bradstreet was a righteous woman and her poetry {{was not meant to}} bring attention to herself. Though Bradstreet's works are renowned in today's world, <b>it</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> a great risk to have had her work published during the time in which she lived. Her being a published author would have not been considered as a typical role of the Puritan woman.|$|E
25|$|Following that film's {{successful}} {{release in}} 1935, Goldwyn purchased {{the rights to}} The Children's Hour for $35,000 while <b>it</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> running on Broadway. Hellman rewrote the play {{to conform to the}} standards of the Motion Picture Production Code, under which any mention of lesbianism was impossible. Instead, one schoolteacher is accused of having sex with the other's fiancé. It appeared in 1936 under the title, These Three. She next wrote the screenplay for Dead End (1937), which featured the first appearance of the Dead End Kids and premiered in 1937.|$|E

Poland continued to be the spiritual center of Judaism. Through 1698, the Polish kings generally remained supportive of the Jews. It also should be noted that while Jewish losses in those events were high, estimated by some historians to be close to 500,000, the Commonwealth lost one third of its population — approximately three million of its citizens.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though the}} Reading was never again to regain its {{powerful}} {{position of the}} 1870s, <b>it</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> a very profitable and important railroad. From {{the turn of the}} 20th century to the outbreak of World War I, the Reading was among the most modern and efficient railroads. In keeping with the standards of much larger railroads, The Reading embarked on many improvement projects which typically were not attempted by smaller railroads. This included triple and quadruple tracking many of its major routes, improving signaling and track quality, as well as expanding system capacity and station facilities.|$|E
25|$|Consistent with Catherine's stance, {{the next}} several decades marked a shift of public {{perception}} against the death penalty. In 1824, {{the very existence of}} such a punishment was among the reasons for legislature's refusal to approve {{a new version of the}} Penal Code. Just one year later, the Decembrist revolt failed, and a court sentenced 36 of the rebels to death. Nicholas I's decision to commute all but five of the sentences was highly unusual for the time, especially taking into account that revolts against the monarchy had almost universally resulted in an automatic death sentence, and was perhaps due to society's changing views of the death penalty. By the late 1890s, capital punishment for murder was virtually never carried out, but substituted with 10 to 15 years imprisonment with hard labor, although <b>it</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> carried out for treason (for example, Alexander Ulyanov was hanged in 1887). However, in 1910, capital punishment was reintroduced and expanded, although still very seldom used.|$|E
25|$|The Wanamaker Organ was {{originally}} {{built by the}} Los Angeles Art Organ Company, successors to the Murray M. Harris Organ Co., for the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. It {{was designed to be}} the largest organ in the world, an imitation of a full-size orchestra with particularly complete resources of full organ tone including mixtures. In addition to its console, the organ {{was originally}} equipped with an automatic player that used punched rolls of paper, according to the Los Angeles Times of 1904. It was designed by renowned organ theorist and architect George Ashdown Audsley. Wild cost overruns plagued the project, with the result that Harris was ousted from his own company. With capital from stockholder Eben Smith, it was reorganized as the Los Angeles Art Organ Company, and finished at a cost of $105,000 (equal to $ today), $40,000 over budget, equal to $ today. The Fair began (in late April 1904) before the organ was fully installed in its temporary home, Festival Hall. <b>It</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> not entirely finished in September of that year, when Alexandre Guilmant, {{one of the most famous}} organists of the day, presented 40 very well-attended recitals on the organ.|$|E

25|$|The Lackawanna Steel {{plant was}} {{declared}} a Superfund site by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1988 after the EPA conducted a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Facility Assessment of the plant. The state of New York subsequently declared it a Class 2 Inactive Hazardous Waste Site, indicating the site poses a significant {{potential threat to}} {{human health and the}} environment. In August 1990, Bethlehem Steel (operating as Tecumseh Redevelopment, Inc.) and the EPA entered into an administrative consent order requiring Bethlehem Steel to identify {{the nature and extent of}} any releases of hazardous waste and mitigate any emergency situations that might be discovered during the course of the investigations. Bethlehem Steel and its successor corporations have been submitting RCRA Facility Investigation (RFI) reports since then. Although the RFI was due to be completed in 2004, <b>it</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> not complete as of June 2008. The plant was also declared a brownfield in 2003 under the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002. While this made the city of Lackawanna eligible for federal assistance money to redevelop part of the site, a cooperative agreement had not been signed as of May 2006.|$|E
500|$|In 1761, the Italian anatomist Giovanni Battista Morgagni {{was first}} to {{describe}} a lung injury that was not accompanied by injury to the chest wall overlying it. Nonetheless, it was the French military surgeon Guillaume Dupuytren who {{is thought to have}} coined the term pulmonary contusion in the 19thcentury. [...] <b>It</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> not until the early 20thcentury that pulmonary contusion and its clinical significance began to receive wide recognition. With the use of explosives during World War I came many casualties with no external signs of chest injury but with significant bleeding in the lungs. [...] Studies of World War I injuries by D.R. Hooker showed that pulmonary contusion was {{an important part of the}} concussive injury that results from explosions.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "C+" [...] and criticized both its monster, and its guest cast.

Concerning the latter, he wrote that the cast was filled with [...] "actors hamming it up". VanDerWerff did note that the episode was better [...] "than its reputation" [...] suggested, but that <b>it</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> [...] "undone by some very strange story choices and a dumb monster". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a {{negative}} review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris bluntly wrote, [...] "if you're looking for a suspenseful, bite-your-nails, monster-of-the-week X-Files episode… this isn't it." [...] Furthermore, she criticized the villain, calling it [...] "a dull monster in fake-looking make-up".|$|E

500|$|The United States {{military}} {{took steps}} to improve Saipan's defenses after the raids of November27. Two USN destroyers were stationed [...] northwest of the island to provide radar warning of further attacks. These ships detected some of the later Japanese raiders, but others managed to arrive undetected. An AN/TPS-3 radar was also flown to Saipan from Hawaii. Arnold became frustrated that the MEW still was not in use, and on December3 Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, {{the commander of the}} Pacific Ocean Areas, ordered that the highest priority be given to installing the radar. Despite this, <b>it</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> not ready until after the conclusion of the Japanese air campaign. Two B-24 Liberator bombers fitted with air-to-air radar sets were also dispatched to Saipan. This was the first use of airborne warning and control aircraft by the United States, but they were not used in combat.|$|E
500|$|Frank Scheck, of the Hollywood Reporter, {{believed}} {{that even though}} Zombie's remake of Carpenter's Halloween was better than getting another sequel in the long running franchise <b>it</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> not comparable to the 1978 original. For Scheck, Zombie replaced Carpenter's building suspense, which made it so [...] "brilliant", with graphic violence and extended scenes of nudity; he also criticized McDowell for lacking the intensity that Donald Pleasence brought to the Loomis character. By contrast, TV Guide's Ken Fox felt that Zombie did deliver a [...] "scary horror movie", not by copying Carpenter, but by making the film his own. Fox noted that Zombie seemed to follow more {{in the footsteps of}} Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper's [...] "savage, greasy-haired '70s" [...] films, which allowed him to bring Michael back to his roots and successfully terrify an audience which has grown accustomed to the recent [...] "torture porn" [...] horror films. Bill Gibron, of PopMatters, believes that audiences and critics cannot compare Carpenter's film to Zombie's remake; where Carpenter focused more on the citizens of Haddonfield—with Michael acting as a true [...] "boogeyman"—Zombie focuses more on Michael himself, successfully forcing the audience to experience all of the elements that Michael went through that would result in his [...] "desire for death".|$|E

2500|$|Unlike {{the other}} sonnets in the Eminent Characters series, [...] "To Lord Stanhope" [...] was not {{published}} in the Morning Chronicle. The first appearance of the poem was in Coleridge's 1796 collection of poems {{and not in the}} Morning Chronicle like the original series. The poem was dedicated to Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope, an individual that held similar beliefs to Coleridge. Unlike his brother-in-law Prime Minister Pitt, Stanhope supported the French Revolution. However, by the time Coleridge would have had the poem printed for his 1796 collection of poems, he changed his mind on Stanhope and the poem was not to be reprinted in later collections. However, <b>it</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> printed in the 1803 collection.
