40|$|The paper {{provides}} a design {{description of a}} tool used for polishing balls made of brittle materials between bottom driving disk and two rings. An external stationary ring has a ring turning of rectangular profile that helps the ring to be based directly on the balls which are to be polished and take self-aligned position in relation to tool rotation axis.   Forces acting on the balls in the points of contact with the tool with due account of friction against a separator and conditions of ball sliding along ring working surfaces are determined in the paper. Dependence for determination of stationary and <b>driving</b> <b>ring</b> load ratio when balls are sliding along two contact surfaces of the tool is ascertained in the paper. The paper contains recommendations on selection of modes for ball polishing at its initial and finishing stages. </p...|$|E

50|$|The art {{historian}} Finn Terman Frederiksen believes {{that while the}} painting provides an extremely accurate rendering of the scene during an unusually warm period in August 1900, {{it can also be}} interpreted as symbolising the cycle of life from night to day, from death to life and, perhaps also, Ring's own rebirth after his marriage to Sigrid Kähler.

He had wrestled three years in high school, however, {{and was able to}} reverse the facelock and make Poffo submit to a guillotine hold. Their training progressed quickly after this incident, with both Angelo Poffo and Randy Savage taking part, and they were put into their first match after only a few sessions. The brothers became close friends with both Lanny and Randy.

The drives are well suited for applications that require both load holding and rotational torque from the same gear box.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} fabrication of a silicon micro gearing system (MGS) that utilizes electrostatic comb-drive actuators to rotate a gear ring through a ratchet mechanism. The rotational comb-drive actuator is engaged with the gear ring through a spring system and ratchet teeth at one end, reciprocally rotates around an elastic point {{at the other end}} based on the electrostatic force. Rotational motion and torque from the <b>driving</b> gear <b>ring</b> are transmitted smoothly to driven gears through involute-shaped gear teeth. Smart design of anti-gap structures helps to overcome the unavoidable gap problem occurred in deep reactive ion etching (deep-RIE) process of silicon. The MGS has been fabricated and tested successfully by using SOI (silicon-on-insulator) wafer and one mask only. The angular velocity of the gear ring is proportional to the driving frequency up to 40 Hz. No Full Tex...|$|R
50|$|The single <b>ring</b> {{involves}} <b>driving</b> a <b>ring</b> {{into the}} soil and supplying water in the ring either at constant head or falling head condition. Constant head refers to condition where {{the amount of water}} in the ring is always held constant. Because infiltration capacity is the maximum infiltration rate, and if infiltration rate exceeds the infiltration capacity, runoff will be the consequence, therefore maintaining constant head means the rate of water supplied corresponds to the infiltration capacity. The supplying of water is done with a Mariotte's bottle. Falling head refers to condition where water is supplied in the ring, and the water is allowed to drop with time. The operator records how much water goes {{into the soil}} for a given time period. The rate of which water goes into the soil is related to the soil's hydraulic conductivity.|$|R

40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} F-ATP synthase synthesises ATP molecules, {{the energy}} currency of life, by utilising the proton transmembrane gradient force {{generated from the}} oxidation of nutrients in the electron transport chain. The bioenergetic cost (in protons) to make one ATP molecule {{is proportional to the}} size of the c-ring (i. e. number of the c-subunits) of the protein. Traditionally, this was thought to be 3. 3 - 5 protons, until the recent discovery that it is more efficient in bovine ATP synthase. Compared with the c 10 - 15 F-ATP synthase <b>driving</b> <b>rings</b> in yeast, eubacterial, and chloroplast ATP synthases, the bovine molecular machine has a c 8 -ring instead. Studies indicated that trimethylation of lysine 43 of the c-subunit is critical for the formation of the c 8 -ring. Since the amino acid sequences of c-subunits are identical in almost all vertebrates and are highly conserved across other Metazoans, it is suggested that all vertebrates and probably all, or most, invertebrates would contain c 8 -rings and the bioerengetic cost to produce one ATP molecule is 2. 7 protons in all animals. In the present project, this hypothesis was examined by isolation of whole F-ATP synthase complex or c-subunits alone purified from selected animals by applying a GST tagged ligand purification method or by iodixanol gradient purification of mitochondria followed by chloroform/methanol extraction of the c-subunits. C-subunits were then separated on SDS-PAGE and several mass spectrometric techniques used to characterise any modifications of the c-subunits. C-subunits from possum, kina, sea cucumbers and sponge were isolated and characterised in this thesis and a total of eighteen vertebrate and fifteen invertebrate organisms were surveyed in the overall study. In every case, a high intensity peak of mass 1343 was detected when c-subunit chymotryptic digests were analysed by MALDI-TOF MS. Furthermore, peptides from chymotryptic digests of c-subunits analysed by ETD-MS with Orbitrap MS confirmed lysine 43 as the trimethylated residue in all species surveyed in these experiments. We conclude that all metazoan c subunits are trimethylated and their F-ATP synthases are driven by c 8 -rings.

40|$|Cytokinesis in many eukaryotes {{requires}} an actomyosin-based contractile ring [1]. In fission yeast, cytokinesis involves the type II myosins Myo 2 p and Myp 2 p {{and the type}} V myosin Myo 51 p [2]. A recent study by Laplante et al. [3], using deletion mutants of myp 2 and myo 51 and the mis-sense mutant myo 2 -E 1 [4], concluded that each myosin has distinct functions and proposed that Myp 2 p plays the dominant role in actomyosin ring contraction. Here we present evidence that Myo 2 p, not Myp 2 p, {{is likely to be}} the major motor <b>driving</b> actomyosin <b>ring</b> contractility. Since the previous work [3] was performed at 25 °C, the permissive temperature for myo 2 -E 1, we compared cytokinesis timings in myo 2 -E 1 and myo 2 Δ at 25 °C and found that myo 2 -E 1 is only partially compromised at 25 °C. Furthermore, we find that myp 2 Δ and myp 2 Δ myo 51 Δ double mutants contract actomyosin rings at ∼ 90...|$|R

Cranna added, [...] " [...] deliver attractive melodies with dark and moody (but not obscure) personal lyrics, all turned into compulsive listening by a <b>driving</b> beat, <b>ringing</b> guitars and a hauntingly emotional voice." [...] Reviewing the album in 1981 for Rolling Stone magazine, David Fricke awarded it {{four out of five}} stars and said when describing McCulloch's vocals, [...] " [...] specializes in a sort of apocalyptic brooding, combining Jim Morrison-style psychosexual yells, a flair for David Bowie-like vocal inflections and the nihilistic bark of his punk peers into a disturbing portrait of the singer as a young neurotic". He went on to say, [...] "Behind him, gripping music swells into Doors-style dirges ('Pictures on My Wall'), PiL-like guitar dynamics ('Monkeys'), spookily evocative pop ('Rescue') and Yardbirds-cum-Elevators ravers jacked up in the New Wave manner ('Do It Clean,' 'Crocodiles')". Reviewing the 2003 remastered version for American music magazine Blenders website, reviewer Andrew Harrison also gave the album four out of five stars and said, [...] " [...] the Bunnymen were a pure nihilistic thrill, with Will Sergeant's desperate, mantra-like guitar summoning up a primal night of blinking hallucinations." ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis article {{presents}} data collected through {{a set of}} experiments with nine to 10 vehicles <b>driving</b> on a <b>ring</b> road constructed on a closed track. Vehicle trajectory data is extracted via a series of vision processing algorithms (for background subtraction, vehicle identification, and trajectory extraction) from a 360 -degree panoramic camera placed {{at the center of the}} ring. The resulting trajectory data is smoothed via a two-step algorithm which applies a combination of RLOESS smoothing and regularized differentiation to produce consistent position, velocity, and acceleration data that does not exhibit unrealistic accelerations common in raw trajectory data extracted from video. A subset of the vehicles also record real-time fuel consumption data of the vehicles using OBD-II scanners. The tests include both smooth and oscillatory traffic conditions, which are useful for constructing and calibrating microscopic models, as well as fuel consumption estimates from these models. The results show a an increase in fuel consumption in the experiments in which traffic oscillations are observed as compared to experiments where vehicles maintain a smooth flow. However, this is partially due to the higher average speed at which vehicles travel in the experiments in which oscillatory traffic is observed. The article contains a complete, publicly available dataset including the video data, the extracted trajectories, the smoothed trajectories, and the OBD-II logs from each equipped vehicle. In addition to the dataset, this article also contains a complete source code for each step of the data processing. It is the first of several experiments planned to collect detailed trajectory data and fuel consumption data with smooth and unsteady traffic flow in a controlled experimental environment...|$|R
40|$|This {{is a very}} {{comprehensive}} review article on electromagnetic metamaterials, written {{with one of the}} foremost experts in the field, S. A. Ramakrishna. Our collaboration is {{supported by a grant from}} the french-indian funding body IFCPAR CEFIPRA entitled 'Plasmonic properties of checkerboard metallic structures and films' (2008 - 2012) International audienceNewly discovered metamaterials have opened new vistas for better control of light via negative refraction, whereby light refracts in the “wrong” manner. These are dielectric and metallic composite materials structured at subwavelength lengthscales. Their building blocks consist of local resonators such as conducting thin bars and split <b>rings</b> <b>driving</b> the material parameters such as the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability to negative (complex) values. Combined together, these structural elements can bring about a (complex valued) negative effective refractive index for the Snell–Descartes law and result in negative refraction of radiation. Negative refractive index materials can support a host of surface plasmon states for both polarizations of light. This makes possible unique effects such as imaging with subwavelength image resolution through the Pendry–Veselago slab lens. Other geometries have also been investigated, such as cylindrical or spherical lenses that enable a magnification of images with subwavelength resolution. Superlenses of three-fold (equilateral triangle), four-fold (square) and six-fold (hexagonal) geometry allow for multiple images, respectively two, three, and five. Generalization to rectangular and triangular checkerboards consisting of alternating cells of positive and negative refractive index represents a very singular situation in which the density of modes diverges at the corners, with an infinity of images. Sine-cosecant anisotropic heterogeneous square and triangular checkerboards can be respectively mapped onto three-dimensional cubic and icosahedral corner lenses consisting of alternating positive and negative refractive regions. All such systems with corners between negative and positive refractive media display very singular behavior with the local density of states becoming infinitely large at the corner, in the limit of no dissipation. We investigate all of these, using the unifying viewpoint of transformation optics...|$|R
5000|$|A {{trial at}} sea was {{arranged}} {{to test the}} effectiveness of the weapon as a deterrent to German aircraft. A prototype flamethrower was installed onto the deck of the French trawler La Patrie, modified to fire vertically. When the RAF pilot arrived, the team responsible for the construction of the flamethrower, worried that the weapon would prove too effective, briefed him on exactly what he could expect to happen. The results of the test were less than impressive: as instructed, the pilot made his first dummy attack without approaching too closely the area directly above the weapon, which was rigged to fire vertically upwards, but on subsequent runs flew {{closer and closer to the}} flame to the point of almost bringing his aircraft directly into the line of fire. The pilot's report made it very clear that he did not believe the weapon to be a very effective deterrent, but admitted that the trials may have been biased by his foreknowledge of their nature. With this in mind, a second trial was arranged with a different pilot. No information at all was given to the man about what he could expect. The results were depressingly similar to those of the first trial [...] - [...] the pilot never wavered in his attack, actually brushing half of his wing into the jet of flame. However, it was discovered afterward that there might be another reason behind the failure of the second test. The pilot chosen for the runs had worked in a circus prior to the war, <b>driving</b> cars through <b>rings</b> and walls of fire on a regular basis. In the belief that the Luftwaffe would have very few men with circus experience, limited production of the Lagonda naval flamethrower began, with weapons being installed onto coasters working in and around the River Thames. The flamethrowers were welcomed by captains at first, until they discovered that the weapon required a very high level of maintenance and expert handling if the weapon was to have sufficient fuel-pressure to be effective, and the crew wished to avoid being coated in tar.|$|R
