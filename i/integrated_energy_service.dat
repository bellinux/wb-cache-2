40|$|Energy {{inefficiency}} in {{the building}} stock is a substantial contributor to climate change. <b>Integrated</b> <b>energy</b> <b>service</b> companies (IESCs) have a potentially important role in improving energy efficiency. This paper presents a qualitative analysis of the energy efficiency barriers in the Finnish building sector {{based on data from}} interviews with twelve IESCs. Taking a novel supply side perspective, we place IESCs at the centre of the emerging energy services business ecosystem to identify the barriers and hindering factors (real world illustrations of barriers). From this perspective, we also examine cause-effect relationships between the hindering factors and the actors. Hindering factors, reported by IESCs, were categorised under a revised barrier taxonomy consisting of economic market failures and economic market, behavioural, organisational and institutional barriers. The most salient hindering factors—lack of technical skills, disinterest in energy efficiency improvements and non-functional regulation—were analysed with respect to ecosystem actors causing and affected by these factors. Public actors have a key role in overcoming these barriers, for instance, by creating new possibilities for entrants to take part in decision-making, increasing the functionality and practicality of policies and by providing up-to date energy efficiency information...|$|E
40|$|This paper draws {{lessons from}} long run trends in energy markets for energy and climate policy. An {{important}} {{lesson is that}} consumer responses to energy markets change with economic development. The British experience suggests that income elasticities 1 of demand for energy services have tended to follow an inverse-U shape curve. Thus, at low levels of economic development, energy service consumption tends to be quite responsive to per capita income changes; at mid-levels, consumption tends to be very responsive to changes in income per capita; and, at high levels, consumption is less responsive to income changes. The paper also {{highlights the importance of}} formulating <b>integrated</b> <b>energy</b> <b>service</b> policies to reduce risks to developing countries of locking-in to carbon intensive infrastructure or behaviour. Without guidance and incentives, rapid economic development is likely to lock consumers into high energy service prices in the long run and bind the economy onto a high energy intensity trajectory with major long run economic and environmental impacts. Thus, effective energy service policies in periods of rapid development, such as in China and India at present, are crucial for the long run prosperity of the economy and their future ability to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions...|$|E

The paper describes the vision and architectural design for the integrated framework.

We focus on smartphones in the IoT, as they are getting increasingly popular and equipped with strong sensing capabilities.

Their interaction with the cloud can support computation offloading and remote data access via the network. In this work, we aim at monitoring the power consumption behaviours of smartphones and profiling individual applications and platform to make better decisions in power management. A solution is to design architecture of cloud orchestration as an epic predictor of the behaviours of smart devices with respect to time, location, and context.

40|$|AbstractAccess {{to modern}} <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> in {{developing}} countries (DC) is a double-faced challenge. About 1. 3 billion {{people do not have}} access to electricity; 2. 6 billion rely on traditional use of biomass for cooking. Solutions to this energy challenge can neither be through isolated promotion of individual technologies nor fuel switching alone. A “system approach” towards a more comprehensive energy access strategy is required. Such access strategy would comprise of the supply of alternative energy carriers and planning of complete energy solutions via a more comprehensive and sustainable Rural Energy Planning (REP) i. e. Sustainable Energization (SE). Existing procedures to SE do not account for the existing energy balance and have not been demonstrated in the context of rural areas. The study aimed to propose and consolidate a more comprehensive REP procedure for SE of rural areas of DC. A seven-step procedure is proposed and its relevance and validity demonstrated through a field case study. The proposed procedure takes into account the existing <b>energy</b> balance and <b>integrates</b> <b>energy</b> drivers in the <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> supply network.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Improving the {{efficiency}} of urban energy systems is an increasingly important issue, as the energy consumption of cities has {{a significant effect on}} energy and climate policy priorities. One promising strategy for delivering these results is to increase the integration of <b>energy</b> <b>services,</b> for example through the use of combined heat and power systems. This paper introduces a tool for analyzing such <b>integrated</b> <b>energy</b> systems and demonstrates it {{in the case of a}} UK eco-town supplied with heat and power from biomass sources. We conclude that the methodology is a powerful tool for assessing potentially convoluted resource chains, a common feature of biomass energy strategies.

40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>service</b> {{contracting}} {{can provide}} a cost-effective route to overcoming barriers to <b>energy</b> efficiency. <b>Energy</b> <b>service</b> contracts allow the client to reduce operating costs, transfer risk and concentrate attention on core activities. However, the <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> model may only be appropriate for a subset of <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> and <b>energy</b> using organisations. A challenge for both business strategy and public policy is to identify those situations in which <b>energy</b> <b>service</b> contracting {{is most likely to}} be appropriate and the conditions under which it is most likely to succeed. <b>Energy</b> <b>service</b> contracting is a form of outsourcing. It will only be chosen where the expected reduction in the production cost of supplying <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> can more than offset the transaction cost of negotiating and managing the relationship with the <b>energy</b> <b>service</b> provider.
