5|$|A: Rules at {{the time}} of the first three ceremonies allowed for a {{performer}} to receive a single nomination which could <b>honor</b> <b>their</b> work in more than one film. Greta Garbo and Norma Shearer were both nominated for two different roles in the same category. Current Academy rules forbid this from happening. No official reason was ever given as to why Shearer won the award for only one of the two films she was listed for.|$|E
5|$|In December 1595, Kepler was {{introduced}} to Barbara Müller, a 23-year-old widow (twice over) with a young daughter, Regina Lorenz, and he began courting her. Müller, heiress to the estates of her late husbands, was also {{the daughter of a}} successful mill owner. Her father Jobst initially opposed a marriage despite Kepler's nobility; though he had inherited his grandfather's nobility, Kepler's poverty made him an unacceptable match. Jobst relented after Kepler completed work on Mysterium, but the engagement nearly fell apart while Kepler was away tending to the details of publication. However, Protestant officials—who had helped set up the match—pressured the Müllers to <b>honor</b> <b>their</b> agreement. Barbara and Johannes were married on April 27, 1597.|$|E
5|$|The World Fantasy Awards are a set {{of awards}} given each year for the best fantasy fiction {{published}} during the previous calendar year.

5|$|The {{idea of a}} new Waldorf-Astoria {{hotel was}} based on the concept {{that there should be a}} large opulent hotel in New York for {{distinguished}} visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to get in the summer of 1929 as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether this was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, who had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to <b>honor</b> <b>their</b> commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate.|$|E
5|$|Though Shuey {{struggled}} upon {{joining the}} Dodgers, recording a 9.35 ERA {{in his first}} eleven appearances after the trade, he altered his approach and began to obtain better results, allowing no runs in his next five appearances. Shuey played for the Dodgers {{through the end of}} the 2003 season. During spring training prior to the 2004 season, he tore a ligament in his thumb and reinjured his hip while fielding a bunt during his rehabilitation. Shuey spent the entire season on the disabled list. The Dodgers sued the Hartford Life Insurance Company, who insured Shuey's contract, over Shuey's $3.25 million salary for the 2004 season, saying the insurance company did not <b>honor</b> <b>their</b> claim.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Umbricht's death, the Colts decided to <b>honor</b> <b>their</b> {{teammate}} by wearing black armbands {{for the entire}} 1964 season. Umbricht's uniform number (32) was immediately retired by the team; {{it was the first}} time the club retired a uniform number, and only the ninth time in Major League history a number was retired. In the Colts' opening-day match against the Cincinnati Reds, starting pitcher Ken Johnson dedicated his victory in Umbricht's memory. The Astros' MVP award was also named in his honor. The back of Umbricht's 1964 Topps baseball card was updated to mention his death shortly before printing. The retirement of Umbricht's number received some criticism, however. Former teammate Jimmy Wynn wrote in his autobiography that Walt Bond, a former Astros player who was African-American, died from leukemia while he was still active. His jersey number was not retired by the club after his death, although he appeared in more games for the Astros than Umbricht. (It should be noted, however, that Bond ended his career not with Houston but as a member of the Minnesota Twins.) Journalists criticizing the retirement of numbers sometimes use Umbricht as an example of someone whose number was retired but who is unfamiliar to baseball fans.|$|E
