Introduction: The VET system provides opportunities for individuals to undertake training for <b>employment-related</b> <b>reasons,</b> to enable further study, or for personal interest and development. Vocational education and training also often provides an entry point to the education system for individuals who have experienced barriers to participation in education. When considering VET for those individuals belonging {{to one or more}} equity group, access and participation alone only tell part of the story. How students participate, and the outcomes they achieve, is also important. For many people in equity groups, lower-level qualifications (certificate levels I and II, for example) may provide an entry point to the VET system. While these qualifications might offer some personal benefits, such as improved self-esteem, the employment and further study outcomes for prime- and mature-aged students {{have been shown to be}} limited. There is a question about whether disadvantaged students are using those qualifications as a stepping stone to further study at higher levels. Graduates of higher-level VET qualifications are more likely to be employed after training and the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) considers a certificate III to be the minimum-level qualification for improving employment outcomes. This trend has been shown to hold true in those equity groups where it has been investigated; for example, Polidano and Mavromaras showed that the completion of a VET qualification at certificate III or above significantly improved the employment of people with a disability. In response to the Bradley Review, the federal government set an objective to increase participation in higher education for some equity groups, especially those from a low socioeconomic background. Transition from lower-level VET to higher-level VET qualifications and into higher education is one way of meeting government targets and increasing participation at those education levels more likely to lead to employment. The focus of this paper is to synthesise what {{is currently}} published on the access and participation of disadvantaged learners in higher-level VET qualifications and higher education, and their transitions from lower-level VET qualifications to higher-level VET and higher education. Where possible, the aim is to focus on the learnersâ€™ perspectives. The paper will consider a number of equity groups: Indigenous Australians, people with a disability, those from rural/remote locations, those with non-English speaking backgrounds, younger people and older people. It needs to be noted that these are not homogenous groups and individuals may experience multiple disadvantage...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the demographic determinants and health status of within-country migrants in Croatia. Data from the Croatian Adult Health Survey from 2003 (N = 9, 070) were used in the analysis. Migrants due to 1991 - 1995 war were excluded from the analysis and only those who indicated that the reason for their migration within Croatia was related to employment or other reasons were included. Prevalence of hypertension and increased body weight was calculated for each of the three migration-related groups (<b>employment-related</b> migrants, other <b>reasons</b> migrants and non-migrants). Migrants were on general younger than non-migrants (more than three quarters of migrant were under 50 years). Employment-related migrants had the lowest prevalence of measured hypertension, while other reasons migrants had the lowest prevalence of increased body weight. Non-migrants had the worse indices in almost every trait and age group that was analysed. The results support the healthy migrant hypothesis, even in case of migrants who migrated within Croatia. However, the results of this study show that health status of migrants may depend on the reasons for their migration, suggesting that future migration studies should record and take this into account...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{household}} survey {{and other data}} sources, the authors analyze returns to education {{and other aspects of}} Ghana's labor market profile from 1987 to 1991. The labor force grew slower than the population did between 1980 and 1990, but the supply of labor is expected to increase as the population of youth is expected to grow faster from 1990 to 2000. And labor force participation rates for 26 - to 45 -year-olds have been increasing rapidly. Over time, the average labor force participation rates of women have become equal to men's; that of children younger than 15 has remained unchanged at 38 percent. More than half of Ghana's child laborers are employed in agriculture. The formal sector's share of employment is on the decline, while the private informal sector's share has increased, especially in urban areas. Over time, the informal sector (in which most workers have a primary education or less) has absorbed more labor than the formal sector (in which most workers have middle or secondary schooling). Unemployment is pervasive in urban areas, and is less visible in rural areas. Labor productivity may not have increased and is possibly declining. Between 1987 and 1992, there was reverse migration, with many people moving from urban to rural areas, mostly for family <b>reasons.</b> <b>Employment-related</b> migration has also been on the increase. As is true elsewhere, the level of education affects participation in the labor force. Literacy rates for women are lower than those for men, which is one reason men dominate the private formal sector. The rate of return to education increases with higher education and work experience. The return for each additional year of schooling rangesfrom 4 percent to 6 percent in Ghana, quite high for a Sub-Saharan African country. Private and social returns to education are greater for primary than for secondary or postsecondary education.
