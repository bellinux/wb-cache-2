5|$|Poetic form is more {{flexible}} in modernist and post-modernist poetry, {{and continues to}} be less structured than in previous literary eras. Many modern poets eschew recognisable structures or forms, and write in <b>free</b> <b>verse.</b> But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in even the best <b>free</b> <b>verse,</b> however much such structures may appear to have been ignored. Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect.|$|E
5|$|Whitman's work {{breaks the}} {{boundaries}} of poetic form and is generally prose-like. He also used unusual images and symbols in his poetry, including rotting leaves, tufts of straw, and debris. He also openly wrote about death and sexuality, including prostitution. He is often labeled {{as the father of}} <b>free</b> <b>verse,</b> though he did not invent it.|$|E
5|$|Gerðr has {{inspired}} {{works of art}} and literature. The Danish poet Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger wrote a series of poems referencing Gerðr as collected in (1819) Nordens Guder. Esaias Tegnér's (1782–1846) unfinished epic poem Gerda also references the goddess. K. Ehrenberg depicted the goddess in his illustration (1883) Freyr und Gerda, Skade und Niurd. Her story was retold in <b>free</b> <b>verse</b> by the Icelandic poet Gerður Kristný in her Blóðhófnir, which won the 2010 Icelandic Literature Award.|$|E

5|$|Literature {{retains a}} strong {{tradition}} in the country; most traditional writers and poets write in the classical Arabic style. In recent years, the number of younger poets influenced by western literature are rising, most writing in <b>free</b> <b>verse</b> and often including political or personal content. Ali Al Shargawi, a decorated longtime poet, was described in 2011 by Al Shorfa as the literary icon of Bahrain.|$|E
5|$|The Imagists {{rejected}} the sentiment and discursiveness typical of much Romantic and Victorian poetry, {{in contrast to}} their contemporaries, the Georgian poets, who were generally content to work within that tradition. Imagism called {{for a return to}} what were seen as more Classical values, such as directness of presentation and economy of language, as well as a willingness to experiment with non-traditional verse forms. Imagists use <b>free</b> <b>verse.</b>|$|E
5|$|The formal {{patterns}} of meter used in Modern English verse to create rhythm no longer dominate contemporary English poetry. In {{the case of}} <b>free</b> <b>verse,</b> rhythm is often organized based on looser units of cadence rather than a regular meter. Robinson Jeffers, Marianne Moore, and William Carlos Williams are three notable poets who reject the idea that regular accentual meter is critical to English poetry. Jeffers experimented with sprung rhythm {{as an alternative to}} accentual rhythm.|$|E

5|$|Aykroyd {{had never}} written a {{screenplay}} before, as he admitted in the 1998 documentary, Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers, or even read one, {{and he was}} unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. His final draft was 324 pages, which was three times longer than a standard screenplay, written not in a standard screenplay format, but more like <b>free</b> <b>verse.</b> To soften the impact, Aykroyd made a joke of the thick script and had it bound with the cover of the Los Angeles Yellow Pages directory for when he turned it in to producer Robert K. Weiss. Landis was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay, which took him about two weeks.|$|E
5|$|In his youth, Stojanović wrote poems, {{only one}} of which is published—in a 1918 issue of the {{literary}} magazine Književni jug, whose editor was future Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić. For this poem, Stojanović was inspired by the Serbian epic hero Ailing Dojčin. A number of Stojanović's poems are preserved in a notebook that belonged to his closest school friend Todor Ilić. According to the poet Dragan Kolundžija, Stojanović's poems are lyrical miniatures composed in <b>free</b> <b>verse,</b> focused on man and nature, and filled with melancholy. Kolundžija finds that what inspired Stojanović to write poetry is reflected in his verse Krvav je bol (Pain is bloody). According to poet Miroslav Feldman, who first met Stojanović in 1919 in Zagreb, his poems were sad and permeated with a yearning for a brighter, more joyous life.|$|E
5|$|The poem, {{written in}} <b>free</b> <b>verse</b> in 206 lines, uses {{many of the}} {{literary}} techniques associated with the pastoral elegy. It {{was written in the}} summer of 1865 during a period of profound national mourning {{in the aftermath of the}} assassination of President Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865. Despite the poem being an elegy to the fallen president, Whitman neither mentions Lincoln by name nor discusses the circumstances of his death. Instead, Whitman uses a series of rural and natural imagery including the symbols of the lilacs, a drooping star in the western sky (Venus), and the hermit thrush, and employs the traditional progression of the pastoral elegy in moving from grief toward an acceptance and knowledge of death. The poem also addresses the pity of war through imagery vaguely referencing the American Civil War (1861–1865) which ended only days before the assassination.|$|E

5|$|Pound's {{editorial}} {{choices were}} {{based on what he}} saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with Imagist precepts, rather than active participation in a group as such. Williams, who was based in the United States, had not participated in any of the discussions of the Eiffel Tower group. However, he and Pound had long been corresponding {{on the question of the}} renewal of poetry along similar lines. Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound, as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier, Pre-Raphaelite-influenced style towards a harder, more modern way of writing. The inclusion of a poem by Joyce, I Hear an Army, which was sent to Pound by W.B. Yeats, took on a wider importance in the history of literary modernism, as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication, at Pound's behest, of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The Egoist. Joyce's poem is not written in <b>free</b> <b>verse,</b> but in rhyming quatrains. However, it strongly reflects Pound's interest in poems written to be sung to music, such as those by the troubadours and Guido Cavalcanti. The book met with little popular or critical success, at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do, and a number of copies were returned to the publisher.|$|E

50|$|For {{the last}} several decades, young writers experimented with new forms of prose as well as poetry. <b>Free</b> <b>verses,</b> sonnets and ballads have been written {{alongside}} the classical forms of poetry such as Kafi, Vaee, Bait, Geet and Dohira.|$|R

40|$|High {{functioning}} {{students with}} autism spectrum disorder (ASD) manifest rigidity {{in their thought}} and behavioural patterns, which are often regarded as negative and challenging trait that disadvantage them in their learning. As a result, their teachers often dismiss them as incapable of literary appreciation and so exclude them from rich and meaningful literary experiences which include reading classics and creative writing. However, the author, a former mainstream school teacher and university academic, of this paper firmly believes that literary appreciation and creative writing could still be taught to such students by tapping on their thought and behavioural rigidity and utilise it as a teaching tool {{to teach them how}} to create <b>free</b> <b>verses.</b> In this paper, the author has created a scaffolding strategy – Question-and-Answer Scaffolding Structure (QASS) – and also illustrated how he has used it to teach his students with ASD to create <b>free</b> <b>verses...</b>|$|R
25|$|Lastly, {{there are}} micro-domains. These are the {{specific}} tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a <b>free</b> <b>verse</b> poem / individual rides at the waterpark.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} Imagism and cubist poetry {{are to be}} found in two poems by T. E. Hulme that were {{published}} in 1909 by the Poets' Club in London. Hulme was a student of mathematics and philosophy who had established the Poets' Club to discuss his theories of poetry. The poet and critic F. S. Flint, who was a champion of <b>free</b> <b>verse</b> and modern French poetry, was highly critical of the club and its publications. From the ensuing debate, Hulme and Flint became close friends. They started meeting with other poets at the Eiffel Tower restaurant in Soho to discuss reform of contemporary poetry through <b>free</b> <b>verse</b> and the tanka and haiku and the removal of all unnecessary verbiage from poems.|$|E
5000|$|In The Vicar of Wakefield, [...] "the happy few" [...] refers {{ironically}} to {{the small}} number of people who read the title character's obscure and pedantic treatise on monogamy. As a literary critic, such as in Racine and Shakespeare, Stendhal championed the Romantic aesthetic by unfavorably comparing the rules and strictures of Jean Racine's classicism to the <b>freer</b> <b>verse</b> and settings of Shakespeare, and supporting the writing of plays in prose.|$|R
50|$|He {{is thought}} to have {{composed}} a number of <b>free</b> metre <b>verses,</b> but it is not known if any still survive.|$|R
5000|$|He {{is known}} mainly for the {{interpretation}} {{and performance of}} his own work. Such work is rare and composed of <b>free</b> <b>verses</b> with a great preponderance of strength and rhythm. Oroza is upon all a great reciter. His poetry is, as music, mainly to be heard because Oroza is a lover of orality, [...] 'the loudness of the words' [...] as he says. He considers books a [...] 'cemetery of signs' [...] He is also considered a wicked poet and an alchemyst.|$|R
25|$|Thirdly, {{there are}} {{specific}} domains. After choosing {{the type of}} park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, {{there are many different}} types (e.g. <b>free</b> <b>verse,</b> riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.|$|E
25|$|Thus {{he gained}} a large {{following}} among Bengali readers. He published such works as Naivedya (1901) and Kheya (1906). Non-Bangla translations were also published, {{but these were}} frequently of mediocre quality. In response to requests by admirers (including painter William Rothenstein), Tagore began translating his poems into <b>free</b> <b>verse.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Victorian novel, Elizabethan drama, <b>free</b> <b>verse</b> and Modernism entered Punjabi {{literature}} {{through the}} introduction of British education during the Raj. Nanak Singh (1897–1971), Vir Singh, Ishwar Nanda, Amrita Pritam (1919–2005), Puran Singh (1881–1931), Dhani Ram Chatrik (1876–1957), Diwan Singh (1897–1944) and Ustad Daman (1911–1984), Mohan Singh (1905–78) and Shareef Kunjahi are some legendary Punjabi writers of this period.|$|E

5000|$|The group {{tried to}} bridge the gap between Spanish popular culture and folklore, {{classical}} literary tradition and European avant-gardes. It evolved from pure poetry which emphasized music in poetry, in the vein of Baudelaire, to Futurism, Cubism, Ultraist and Creationism, to become influenced by Surrealism and finally to disperse in interior and exterior exile following the Civil War and World War II (sometimes gathered by historians under the term of the [...] "European Civil War"). The Generation of '27 made a frequent use of visionary images, <b>free</b> <b>verses</b> and the so-called impure poetry preconized by Pablo Neruda.|$|R
